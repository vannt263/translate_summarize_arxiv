    "the magnetic induction equations are a special form of the maxwell s equations that describe the evolution of the magnetic field under the influence of a given velocity field .",
    "these equations arise in a wide variety of applications in plasma physics , astrophysics and electrical engineering .",
    "one important application are the equations of magneto - hydro dynamics ( mhd ) .",
    "these equations combine the euler equations of gas dynamics with the magnetic induction equations .",
    "our goal in this paper is to describe stable and high - order accurate numerical schemes for the magnetic induction equations .",
    "we start with a brief description of how the equations are derived .",
    "let the magnetic field and given velocity field be denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "faraday s law for the magnetic flux across a surface @xmath2 bounded by a curve @xmath3 is given by ( see @xcite ) , @xmath4 using the stokes theorem and the fact that the electric field , @xmath5 , in a co - moving frame is zero and the magnetic resistivity is zero , faraday s law takes the form , @xmath6 using simple vector identities , ( [ eq : induc ] ) can be rewritten as , @xmath7 magnetic monopoles have never been observed in nature . as a consequence , the magnetic field is always assumed to be divergence free , i.e. , @xmath8 .",
    "hence , it is common to set the right - hand side of ( [ eq : induction ] ) to zero and couple the induction equation with the divergence constraint in order to obtain @xmath9 this form ( [ eq : maxwell3d ] ) is commonly used in the literature as the appropriate form of the magnetic induction equations to study and discretize .",
    "it is easy to see that ( [ eq : maxwell3d ] ) is hyperbolic but not strictly hyperbolic .",
    "an important tool in the analysis of hyperbolic system of equations is the derivation of energy estimates .",
    "the usual procedure in deriving energy estimates consists of symmetrizing the hyperbolic system .",
    "it is not possible to symmetrize ( [ eq : maxwell3d ] ) without explicitly using the divergence constraint .",
    "hence , it is difficult to obtain energy stability starting from ( [ eq : maxwell3d ] ) .    on the other hand",
    ", we can use the following vector identity @xmath10 and rewrite ( [ eq : induc ] ) in the non - conservative symmetric form , @xmath11 where the @xmath12 denotes the gradient of @xmath1 and the matrix @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 introducing the matrix , @xmath15 ( [ eq : induc ] ) can also be written in the following `` conservative '' symmetric form , @xmath16 where @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "note that the symmetrized matrices in ( [ eq : induc2 ] ) are diagonal and that the only coupling in the equations is through the lower order terms .",
    "these symmetrized forms are in the same spirit as the non - linear symmetrized forms of mhd equations introduced in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , by taking divergence on both sides of ( [ eq : induction ] ) we get @xmath19 hence , if @xmath20 , also @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "this implies that all the above forms ( [ eq : induc2 ] ) , and ( [ eq : maxwell3d ] ) are equivalent ( at least for smooth solutions ) . introducing the space @xmath23 as @xmath24 we have the following theorem :    assume that the velocity field @xmath1 is sufficiently smooth , and that @xmath25",
    ". then there exists a unique weak solution @xmath26;{h^{\\mathrm{div}}}({\\mathbb{r}}^3))$ ] of ( [ eq : induc2 ] ) .",
    "the solution @xmath0 satisfies the energy estimate , @xmath27 the constant @xmath28 depends only on the final time @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath30 , then the physical form ( [ eq : induc ] ) and the symmetric form ( [ eq : induc2 ] ) are equivalent to the constrained form ( [ eq : maxwell3d ] ) , i.e. , @xmath0 is also the unique weak solution of ( [ eq : maxwell3d ] ) .",
    "the proof of the above theorem uses the energy estimate and we will provide a sketch of the proof for the two - dimensional version of the equations together with boundary conditions later in this paper .",
    "even though the magnetic induction equations are linear , the presence of variable coefficients and lower order terms means that general closed form solutions are not available .",
    "hence , one has to design suitable numerical schemes for these equations .",
    "furthermore , since these equations appear as a sub - model in the mhd equations , the design of stable and high - order accurate numerical schemes for the induction equations can lead to the design of robust schemes for the non - linear mhd equations .",
    "most of the attention in the literature has been focused on the constrained form ( [ eq : maxwell3d ] ) .",
    "the key issue in the design of a suitable numerical scheme to approximate ( [ eq : maxwell3d ] ) has been the treatment of the divergence constraint .",
    "a widely used approach has been to employ projection methods based on a hodge decomposition of the magnetic field . a base ( finite difference or finite volume ) scheme is used to evolve the magnetic field .",
    "the evolved field , which need not be divergence free , is then corrected for divergence errors by solving an elliptic equation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting method is computationally expensive , as the elliptic equation has to be solved at every time step .",
    "another common approach is to discretize ( [ eq : maxwell3d ] ) such that some particular form of discrete divergence is preserved at each time step ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this approach is equivalent to staggering the velocity and magnetic fields in each direction ( see @xcite and a detailed comparison in @xcite ) . some of these schemes are proved to be von neumann stable in the special case of constant velocity fields .",
    "no stability analysis is available either in the case of variable velocity fields or for problems with boundary conditions .",
    "these schemes also involve wider stencils than what is required for a standard finite difference scheme .",
    "despite all the attempts at finding a suitable discretization of ( [ eq : maxwell3d ] ) and preserving a special form of discrete divergence , it is not clear as to whether such an approach is appropriate",
    ". furthermore , there are many different choices for the discrete divergence operator and preserving some form of discrete divergence exactly does not lead to preservation or even keeping divergence errors small for a different form",
    ". the main aim should be to design a stable scheme to approximate magnetic fields and it is not clear whether preserving divergence in a particular discrete form helps .",
    "one reason for the difficulties in proving stability of discretizations for ( [ eq : maxwell3d ] ) with general velocity fields may lie in the very form of these equations . as remarked earlier , ( [ eq : maxwell3d ] ) are not symmetrizable directly and thus one can not obtain energy estimates in this form .",
    "this remains true for discretizations of ( [ eq : maxwell3d ] ) .    a different approach consisting of discretizing the physical form ( [ eq : induc ] )",
    "was proposed in @xcite for the non - linear mhd equations . adapting this to ( [ eq : induc ] ) implies using a standard upwind scheme for the convection part and a centered discretization of the source terms . from ( [ eq : divt ] ) , one can expect that divergence errors will be transported out of the domain for transparent boundary conditions .",
    "this approach does not imply stability either and can lead to oscillations as reported in @xcite . a discontinuous galerkin based discretization of the symmetric form ( [ eq : induc2 ] )",
    "was proposed in @xcite .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", the authors discretized the symmetric form ( [ eq : induc1 ] ) by using a first order accurate upwind finite difference scheme .",
    "the resulting scheme also implied an upwind discretization of the convection term in ( [ eq : induc ] ) with an upwind discretization of the source term .",
    "this scheme was shown to be energy stable even with variable velocity fields and to be tvd for constant velocity fields .",
    "furthermore , boundary conditions were not considered either in @xcite or any of the aforementioned papers .",
    "high - order accurate schemes will lead to much better resolution of interesting solution features and a stable discretization of the boundary conditions ( while still preserving high order of accuracy ) is desirable .",
    "our aim in this paper is to design stable and high - order accurate schemes for initial - boundary value problems corresponding to the magnetic induction equations by discretizing the non - conservative symmetric form ( [ eq : induc1 ] ) .",
    "the spatial derivatives are approximated by second and fourth - order sbp ( summation - by - parts ) operators .",
    "the boundary conditions are weakly imposed by using a sat ( simultaneous approximation term ) and time integration is performed by standard runge - kutta schemes .",
    "the sbp - sat framework has been used to obtain stable and accurate high order schemes for a wide variety of hyperbolic problems in recent years .",
    "see @xcite and the references therein for more details .",
    "the sbp - sat schemes use centered finite difference stencils in the interior , which lead to oscillations in the vicinity of discontinuities .",
    "we apply well - known sbp - sat compatible numerical diffusion operators in case of discontinuous data .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : cp ] , we state the energy estimate for the initial - boundary value problem corresponding to ( [ eq : induc1 ] ) in order to motivate the proof of stability for the scheme . in section",
    "[ sec : scheme ] , we present the sbp - sat scheme and show stability .",
    "numerical experiments are presented in section  [ sec : numex ] and conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "for ease of notation , we shall restrict ourselves to two spatial dimensions in the remainder of this paper .",
    "extending the results to three dimensions is straightforward .    in two dimensions ,",
    "the non - conservative symmetric form ( [ eq : induc1 ] ) reads @xmath31 where @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 denoting the magnetic and velocity fields respectively . in component form , ( [ eq : main ] ) becomes @xmath35 to begin with , we shall consider ( [ eq : main ] ) in the domain @xmath36 ^ 2 $ ] .    we augment ( [ eq : main ] ) with initial conditions , @xmath37 and dirichlet boundary conditions , @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the characteristic function of the set @xmath40 .",
    "note that we only impose boundary conditions on the set where the characteristics are entering the domain .",

    "we mean the @xmath47 trace of @xmath0 at the boundary .",
    "the boundary conditions ( [ eq : boundary ] ) are taken in the sense of @xmath47 traces .",

    "the proof of this theorem is standard .",
    "assume first that @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath1 are in @xmath59 .",
    "since the compatibility conditions are satisfied , a unique solution exists by the method of characteristics .",
    "let @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "multiplying the equation by @xmath0 and integrating over @xmath43 yields @xmath62 for some constant @xmath63 depending on @xmath1 and its first derivatives . via the grnwall inequality",
    "we get the bound @xmath64 set @xmath65 and @xmath66 , applying @xmath67 to ( [ eq : main ] ) yields @xmath68 furthermore , @xmath69 and at those parts of @xmath70 where we impose boundary data @xmath71 we shall also be needing @xmath72 on @xmath73 and @xmath74 and @xmath75 on @xmath76 and @xmath74 .",
    "these are given by @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively .",
    "multiplying ( [ eq : peq ] ) with @xmath79 and rearranging yields @xmath80 we also have an analogous equation for @xmath81 ; @xmath82 adding these two equations we find @xmath83 where by hlder s inequality @xmath84 has the bound @xmath85 where the constant @xmath63 depends on @xmath1 and its derivatives . by reasoning",
    "as we did with @xmath0 , we can then get the bound @xmath86 via grnwall s inequality and the bounds on @xmath87 we find @xmath88 where the constant depends on the @xmath89 norm of @xmath58 and @xmath57 and on @xmath1 and its derivatives .",
    "this means that we have an energy estimate @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a finite constant depending on @xmath92 , @xmath1 and its derivatives .",
    "then , for a general initial data , velocity fields and boundary conditions , we can use a standard approximation argument ( @xcite ) and the above estimate to pass to the limit and prove the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions .",
    "the above theorem has been proved in the unit square .",
    "it can be easily extended to domains with smooth ( i.e. , @xmath93 boundaries ) by using cut - off functions and mappings between the domain and the upper - half space .",
    "see @xcite and other references therein for details .",
    "as stated before , we will approximate ( [ eq : main ] ) with sbp - sat finite difference schemes .",
    "we start by defining a sbp operator approximating the first derivative of a continuous function @xmath94 in one space dimension .",

    "we organize the values of @xmath99 at @xmath100 in a vector @xmath101 where @xmath102 .",

    "moreover , @xmath107 must define a scalar product @xmath112 for which the corresponding norm , @xmath113 , is equivalent to the standard @xmath114-norm , @xmath115 .",

    "we conclude this section with a few comments . for simplicity , we have only considered cartesian meshes",
    ". however , the proofs are readily generalized to curvilinear grids by transforming the domain to a cartesian . a stability proof is then obtained by freezing the coefficients",

    "furthermore , multi - block grids can also be handled and stable interfaces derived in a similar way as in , @xcite .",
    "we test the sbp - sat schemes of the previous section on a suite of numerical experiments in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of these schemes",

    "the @xmath195 scheme is not tailored to preserve any form of discrete divergence .",
    "the divergence errors generated by this scheme seems to be low on coarse meshes .",
    "the @xmath193 and @xmath194 schemes are designed to preserve a special form of discrete divergence which is different from the standard central form . nevertheless , the analysis presented in  @xcite suggested that the errors in the standard divergence operator will also be quite low .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "on the coarser meshes , the divergence is much larger for the @xmath170 scheme than the @xmath193 schemes , but from table  [ tab:6 ] we see that the errors in the solution are similar .",
    "furthermore , the divergence errors converge quickly for the @xmath171 scheme , as well as as the for the @xmath194 scheme .",
    "the above results indicate that controlling some form of discrete divergence is not necessary to approximate solutions of the magnetic induction equations in a stable and accurate manner .",
    "next , we consider long time integration .",
    "the energy estimate ( [ eq : enestdisc ] ) suggests that the energy of the approximate solutions can grow exponentially in time . in order to test this we computed approximate solutions with the @xmath170 , @xmath171 and the @xmath194 schemes till time @xmath208 , i.e. , for fifty full rotations on a @xmath209 mesh .",

    "[ fig:2 ] , we compare the @xmath170 and @xmath171 schemes after five and fifty rotations respectively .",
    "we see that after 5 rotations , @xmath170 gives a `` hump '' which is somewhat smeared and with a pronounced asymmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "the hump produced by the @xmath171 scheme is much more accurate .",
    "as shown in table [ tab:2 ] , the absolute errors with the @xmath171 scheme are much lower than the errors due to the second - order schemes @xmath170 and @xmath194 .",
    "in fact , the errors with @xmath170 after just five rotations are about three times the error with @xmath171 after fifty rotations .",
    "this experiment makes a strong case for using high - order schemes for problems requiring long time integration .",
    "* numerical experiment @xmath191 : * in the previous numerical experiment , the hump was confined to the interior of the domain during the rotation .",
    "hence , the choice of zero dirichlet data at the boundary was reasonable and led to stable and accurate approximations . in order to illustrate the effect of the boundary better , we choose the computational domain @xmath96 \\times [ 0,1]$ ] and",

    "it turns out that a different scaling ( dividing by the mesh size ) of the numerical diffusion operator leads to a first order ( third - order ) `` upwind '' scheme .",

    "we use the exact solution restricted to the boundary as the dirichlet boundary data .",

    "these schemes were based on the non - conservative symmetric form ( [ eq : induc1 ] ) and use @xmath225 finite difference operators to approximate spatial derivatives and a @xmath226 technique for implementing boundary conditions .",

    "these schemes were tested on a series of numerical experiments , which illustrated their stability and high - order of accuracy .",
    "interesting solution features were resolved very well .",
