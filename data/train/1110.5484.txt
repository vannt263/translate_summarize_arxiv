    "the goal of cryptography is to ensure that the secret message is intelligible only for the two authorized parties of communication and should not be altered during the transmission .",
    "so far , it is trusted that the only proven secure cryptophyte is the one - time - pad scheme in which the secret key is as long as the message .",
    "the two distant parties who want to transmit their secret message must distribute the secret key first .",
    "but it is difficult to distribute securely the secret key through a classical channel . the quantum key distribution ( qkd ) , whose task is to create a secret key between two remote authorized users , is one of the most remarkable applications of quantum mechanics and the only proven protocol for secure key distribution . since bennet and brassard presented the pioneer qkd protocol ( bb84 protocol ) [ 1 ] in 1984 , a lot of quantum information security processing methods have been advanced , such as quantum teleportation [ 2 - 7 ] , quantum dense coding [ 8 - 9 ] , quantum secret sharing [ 10 - 11 ] and so on .",
    "+ in recent years , a novel concept , quantum secure direct communication ( qsdc ) was put forward and studied by some groups .",
    "different from key distribution whose object is to establish a common random key between two parties , a secure direct communication is to communication important message directly without first establishing a random key to encrypt them . thus secure direct communication is more demanding on the security . as a secure direct communication ,",
    "it must satisfy two requirements .",
    "first , the secure message should be read out directly by the legitimate user bob when he receives the quantum state and no additional classical information is needed after the transmission of particles .",
    "second , the secret message which has been encoded already in the quantum states should not leak even though an eavesdropper may get hold of the channel .",
    "that is to say , the eavesdropper can not only be detected but also obtains blind results . as classical message can be copied fully , it is impossible to transmit secret message directly through classical channels .",
    "but when quantum mechanics enters into the communication , the story will change .",
    "+ another class of quantum communication protocols [ 12 - 14 ] used to transmit secret message are called deterministic secure quantum communication ( dsqc ) .",
    "certainly , the receiver can read out the secret message only after he ex - changes at least one bit of classical information for each particle with the sender in a dsqc protocol , which is different from qsdc .",
    "dsqc is similar to qkd , but it can be used to obtain deterministic information , not a random binary string , which is different from the qkd protocols in which the user can not predict whether an instance is useful or not .",
    "+ many people are interested in researching qsdc , and many protocols like qsdc were proposed , including the protocols without using entanglement [ 15 - 17 ] , the protocols using entanglement [ 18 - 23 ] and the two - way qsdc protocols [ 24 - 33].the qsdc protocol can also be used in some special environments as first proposed by bostr?m et al .",
    "[ 34 ] and deng et al .",
    "[ 18 ] . in ref .",
    "[ 34 ] , bostrom and felbinger presented a famous qsdc protocol which is called `` ping - pong '' protocol . but",
    "researchers have found much vulnerability in the `` ping - pong '' protocol , such as the `` ping - pong '' protocol can not resist the `` man - in - middle attack '' and the transmission capacity is low . + in order to improve the eavesdropping detection efficiency in two - step quantum direct communication protocol , an improved eavesdropping detection strategy using four - particle ghz state is proposed , in which four - particle ghz state is used to detect eavesdroppers . during the security analysis , the method of the entropy theory is introduced , and two detection strategies are compared quantitatively by using the constraint between the information which eavesdropper can obtain and the interference introduced . if the eavesdroppers intend to obtain all information , the eavesdropping detection rate of the original two - step quantum direct communication protocol by using epr pair block as detection particles is 50% ; while the proposed strategy s detection rate is 88% .",
    "in the end , the security of the proposed protocol is discussed .",
    "the analysis results show that the eavesdropping detection strategy presented is more secure .",
    "+ for simplicity , suppose that the protocol presented in ref . [ 18 ] is shortened as dpp and the improved protocol in this paper is shortened as fpp .",
    "an epr pair can be in one of the four bell states , @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 if the state of a single photon be measured , the bell state will collapse and the state of the other particle will be completely determined if we know the measurement result of the first photon . as is known to all ,",
    "the basic principle of the original `` ping - pong '' protocol is that one bit information can be encoded in the states @xmath6 , which is completely unavailable to anyone who has access to either of the particles . to extract secret message from alice",
    ", bob must own both particles , for no experiment performed on only one particle can distinguish these states from each other [ 34 ] .",
    "+ let us start with a brief description of the dpp protocol .",
    "+ ( s1 ) alice prepares an ordered _",
    "n _ epr pairs in state @xmath7 , extracts all the first particles , and forming the sequence @xmath8 in order .",
    "the remainder particles are formed the sequence @xmath9 in order .",
    "+ ( s2 ) alice sends the sequence @xmath8 to bob .",
    "alice and bob then check eavesdropping by the following procedure:(a ) bob chooses randomly a number of the photons from the sequence @xmath8 and tells alice which particles he has chosen .",
    "( b ) bob chooses randomly one of the two sets of mbs , say , @xmath10 and @xmath11 to measure the chosen photons .",
    "( c ) bob tells alice which mb he has chosen for each photon and the outcomes of his measurements .",
    "( d ) alice uses the same mb as bob to measure the corresponding photons in the sequence @xmath9 and checks with the results of bob .",
    "if no eavesdropper exists , their results should be completely opposite .",
    "this is the first eavesdropping check .",
    "after that , if the error rate is small , alice and bob can conclude that there is no eavesdropper in the line .",
    "alice and bob continue to perform step(s3 ) ; otherwise , they have to discard their transmission and abort the communication .",
    "+ ( s3 ) alice encodes her messages on the sequence @xmath9 and transmits it to bob . before the transmission",
    ", alice must encode the epr pairs . in order to guard for eavesdropping in this transmission ,",
    "alice has to add a small trick in the sequence @xmath9 .",
    "she selects randomly in the sequence @xmath9 some particles and performs on them randomly one of the four operations .",
    "the number of such particles is not big as long as it can provide an analysis of the error rate .",
    "only alice knows the positions of these sampling particles and keeps them secret until the communication is completed .",
    "the remaining sequence @xmath9 particles are used to carry the secret message directly . to encode the message",
    ", they use the dense coding scheme of bennett and wiesner [ 8 ] , where the information is encoded on an epr pair with a local operation on a single qubit . here , the dense coding idea was generalized into secure direct communication .",
    "different from dense coding , in this protocol , both the particles in an epr pair are sent from alice to bob in two steps , and the transmission of epr pairs is done in block .",
    "explicitly , alice makes one of the four unitary operations ( @xmath12,@xmath13,@xmath14 and @xmath15 ) to each of her particles , @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 and they transform the state @xmath7 into @xmath7 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "these operations correspond to 00 , 01 , 10 and 11 , respectively .",
    "+ ( s4 ) after the transmission of sequence @xmath9 , alice tells bob the positions of the sampling pairs and the type of the unitary operations on them .",
    "bob performs bell - basis measurement on the sequence @xmath8 and @xmath9 simultaneously . by checking the sampling pairs that alice has chosen",
    ", he will get an estimate of the error rate in the sequence @xmath9 transmission .",
    "in fact , in the second transmission , eve can only disturb the transmission and can not steal the information because she can only get one particle from an epr pair .",
    "+ ( s5 ) if the error rate of the sampling pairs is reasonably low , alice and bob can then entrust the process , and continue to correct the error in the secret message using error correction methods .",
    "otherwise , alice and bob abandon the transmission and repeat the procedure from the beginning .",
    "+ ( s6 ) alice and bob do error correction on their results .",
    "this procedure is exactly the same as that in qkd .",
    "however , to preserve the integrity of the message , the bits preserving correction code , such as cascade [ 35 ] , should be used .",
    "in the protocol presented in ref.[36 ] , the transmission is managed in batches of _ n _ epr pairs .",
    "an advantage of block transmission scheme is that we can check the security of the transmission by measuring some of the decoy photons [ 37 - 38 ] in the first step , where both alice and bob contain a particle sequence at hand , which means that an eavesdropper has no access to the first particle sequence , then no information will be leaked to her whatever she has done to the second particle sequence . following this method using block transmission ,",

    ". then @xmath52 however , in dpp , authors calculated the efficiency of eavesdropping detection , here do nt analyze it again , and the efficiency is @xmath53 now , let us analyze how much information eve can gain maximally when there is no control mode .",

    "[ 18 ] , first , let us suppose that the quantum state of the photon in the hand of alice is @xmath26 , alice takes measurement on the photon in her hand with single - photon detector and the state is @xmath26 .",
    "then the state of the system composed of bob s photon is @xmath54 and eve s probe can be described by @xmath55 after encoding of the unitary operations @xmath12,@xmath13,@xmath14 and @xmath15 with the probabilities @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively , the state reads @xmath58",
    "@xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 which can be rewritten in the orthogonal basis @xmath62 , @xmath63 with @xmath64 the information @xmath65 that eve can get is equal to the von neumann entropy @xmath66 where @xmath67 are the eigenvalues of @xmath68 , which are @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 in the case of @xmath73 , where alice encodes exactly 2 bits , expression(25 - 26 ) simplify to @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",

    "the above security analysis can be done in full analogy , resulting in the same crucial relations .",
    "the maximal amount of information is equal to the shannon entropy of a binary channel @xmath78 @xmath79 so the maximal amount of information that eve can obtain is @xmath80 after some simple mathematical calculations in fpp , when @xmath81 , get @xmath82 and the maximum @xmath83 is @xmath84{1-d_{lf}}),\\ ] ] where @xmath85 however , in dpp , the maximum @xmath83 is @xmath86 the above analysis shows that function @xmath87 and @xmath88 have the similar algebraic properties . if eve wants to gain the full information ( @xmath89 ) , the probabilities of eavesdropping detection are @xmath90 in dpp and @xmath91 in fpp .",

    ". in the limit @xmath97 ( a message or key of infinite length ) get @xmath98 , so the presented protocol in this paper is _ asymptotically secure_. if the security of the quantum channel is ensured , the protocol is completely secure .",
    "for example , a choice of the decoy mode is @xmath99 . in fig.3 , the eavesdropping success probability as a function of the information gain _",
    "i _ is plotted , for @xmath99 and for different detection probabilities _ d _ which eve can choose .",
    "note that for @xmath100 , eve only gets part of the message right and does not even know which part .",
    "so , the fpp protocol is proved secure .",
    "in summary , an improved eavesdropping detection strategy based on quantum direct communication protocol based on four - particle ghz state has been introduced , and two eavesdropping detection strategies are compared quantitatively by using the constraint between the information that eavesdropper obtains and the interference introduced . in fpp , the sequence _ b _ is always in hands of bob and eve can only touch the sequence _ a _ , and any useful message will not be leaked to the potential eavesdropper . so the security message can be securely transmitted to the receiver . compared with the dpp , in the fpp protocol",
    ", the four - particle ghz state particles are used to detect eavesdropping which increases the efficiency of detection eavesdropping .",
    "+ in the analysis , if the eavesdropper obtains the full information , she must face a larger detection probability in the fpp than dpp , which shows that the efficiency of eavesdropping detection in fpp is higher than dpp , so it can ensure the quantum direct communication protocol more secure . in order to detect eavesdropping",
    ", bob sends more decoy photons than dpp , while this method reduces the number of measurement .",
    "that is , bob gains the better security at the cost of sending more particles .",
    "+ as we know , the quantum direct communication protocol can also be used as an efficient qkd protocol . in this paper , only the situation that the improved protocol is used as a qkd strategy is considered .",
    "so the weaknesses which the quantum direct communication protocol must be faced , such as the noise channel [ 39 - 40 ] , the dos attack [ 41 - 42 ] and so on , may not be considered . in the further work",
    ", the other qsdc protocol will be researched .",
