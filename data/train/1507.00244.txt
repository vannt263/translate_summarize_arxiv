    "<S> in this note , we comment on the relevance of elicitability for backtesting risk measure estimates . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we propose the use of diebold - mariano tests , and show how they can be implemented for expected shortfall ( es ) , based on the recent result of @xcite that es is jointly elicitable with value at risk .    </S>",
    "<S> there continues to be lively debate about the appropriate choice of a quantitative risk measure for regulatory purposes or internal risk management . in this context , it has been shown by @xcite and @xcite that expected shortfall ( es ) is not elicitable . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , there is no strictly consistent scoring ( or loss ) function @xmath0 such that , for any random variable @xmath1 with finite mean , we have @xmath2.\\ ] ] recall that es of @xmath1 at level @xmath3 is defined as @xmath4 where value at risk ( var ) is given by @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , var at level @xmath3 is elicitable for random variables with a unique @xmath6-quantile . </S>",
    "<S> the possible strictly consistent scoring functions for var are of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a strictly increasing function .    however , it turns out that es is elicitable of higher order in the sense that the pair ( var@xmath9 , es@xmath9 ) is jointly elicitable . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we have that @xmath10,\\ ] ] where possible choices of @xmath11 are given by @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 being strictly increasing continuously differentiable functions such that the expectation @xmath15 $ ] exists , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ; see ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * corollary 5.5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> one can nicely see the structure of @xmath11 : the first summand in is exactly a strictly consistent scoring function for var@xmath9 given at and hence only depends on @xmath18 , whereas the second summand can not be split into a part depending only on @xmath18 and one depending only on @xmath19 , respectively , hence illustrating the fact that es@xmath9 itself is not elicitable . </S>",
    "<S> a possible choice for @xmath13 and @xmath14 is @xmath20 and @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite proposed a scoring function for the pair ( var@xmath9 , es@xmath9 ) under the additional assumption that there exists a real number @xmath22 such that @xmath23 for all assets @xmath1 under consideration . despite encouraging simulation results , there is currently no formal proof available of the strict consistency of their proposal . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the scoring functions given at do not require additional assumptions , and it has been formally proven that they provide a class of strictly consistent scoring functions .    </S>",
    "<S> the lack of elicitability of es ( of first order ) has led to a lively discussion about whether or not and how it is possible to backtest es forecasts ; see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is generally accepted that elicitability is useful for model selection , estimation , generalized regression , forecast comparison , and forecast ranking . </S>",
    "<S> having provided strictly consistent scoring functions for ( var@xmath9 , es@xmath9 ) , we take the opportunity to comment on the role of elicitability in backtesting .    </S>",
    "<S> the traditional approach to backtesting aims at model verification . to this end , </S>",
    "<S> one tests the null hypothesis : @xmath24 specifically , suppose we have sequences @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the realized value of the asset at time point @xmath28 , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the estimated var@xmath9 and es@xmath9 given at time @xmath31 for time point @xmath28 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> a backtest uses some test statistic @xmath32 , which is a function of @xmath33 , such that we know the distribution of @xmath32 ( at least approximately ) if the null hypothesis of correct risk measure estimates holds . </S>",
    "<S> if we reject @xmath34 at some small level , the model or the estimation procedure for the risk measure is deemed inadequate . for this approach of model verification , elicitability of the risk measure </S>",
    "<S> is not relevant , as pointed out by @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , tests of this type can be problematic in regulatory practice , notably in view of the anticipated revised standardised approach @xcite , which `` should provide a credible fall - back in the event that a bank s internal market risk model is deemed inadequate '' . </S>",
    "<S> if the internal model fails the backtest , the standardised approach may fail the test , too , and in fact it might be inferior to the internal model . </S>",
    "<S> generally , tests of the hypothesis @xmath34 are not aimed at , and do not allow for , model comparison and model ranking .    </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , one could use the following null hypothesis in backtesting : @xmath35 here , the standard procedure could be a method specified by the regulator , or it could be a technique that has proven to yield good results in the past . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , let us write @xmath36 for the sequence of var@xmath9 and es@xmath9 estimates by the standard procedure . </S>",
    "<S> making use of the elicitability of ( var@xmath9 , es@xmath9 ) , we take one of the scoring functions @xmath11 given at to define the test statistic @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is a suitable estimate of the respective standard deviation . under @xmath40 , the test statistic </S>",
    "<S> @xmath41 has expected value less than or equal to zero . </S>",
    "<S> following the lead of @xcite , comparative tests that are based on the asymptotic normality of the test statistics @xmath41 have been employed in a wealth of applications .    under both @xmath34 and @xmath40 , </S>",
    "<S> the backtest is passed if the null hypothesis fails to be rejected . </S>",
    "<S> however , as @xcite noted , `` the null hypothesis is never proved or established , but it is possibly disproved , in the course of experimentation . '' in other words , a passed backtest does not imply the validity of the respective null hypothesis . passing </S>",
    "<S> the backtest simply means that the hypothesis of correctness ( @xmath34 ) or superiority ( @xmath40 ) , respectively , could not be falsified .     </S>",
    "<S> and @xmath42 at level @xmath43 . in the yellow region </S>",
    "<S> the approaches entail distinct decisions . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1],scaledwidth=80.0% ]    in the case of comparative backtests , a more conservative approach could be based on the following null hypothesis : @xmath44 this can also be tested using the statistic @xmath41 in , which has expected value greater than or equal to zero under @xmath42 . the backtest now is passed when @xmath42 is rejected . </S>",
    "<S> the decisions taken in comparative backtesting under @xmath40 and @xmath42 are illustrated in figure [ fig:1 ] , where the colors relate to the three - zone approach of the @xcite . in regulatory practice , </S>",
    "<S> the distinction between diebold - mariano tests under the two hypotheses amounts to a reversed onus of proof . in the traditional </S>",
    "<S> setting , it is the regulator s burden to show that the internal model is incorrect . in contrast , if a backtest is passed when @xmath42 is rejected , banks are obliged to demonstrate the superiority of the internal model . </S>",
    "<S> such an approach to backtesting may entice banks to improve their internal models , and is akin to regulatory practice in the health sector , where market authorisation for medicinal products hinges on comparative clinical trials . in the health context </S>",
    "<S> , decision - making under @xmath40 corresponds to equivalence or non - inferiority trials , which are `` not conservative in nature , so that many flaws in the design or conduct of the trial will tend to bias the results '' , whereas `` efficacy is most convincingly established by demonstrating superiority '' under @xmath42 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> technical detail is available in a specialized strand of the biomedical literature ; for a concise review , see @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we now give an illustration in the simulation setting of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , let @xmath45 be a sequence of independent standard normal random variables . </S>",
    "<S> conditional on @xmath46 , the return @xmath47 is normally distributed with mean @xmath46 and variance 1 , denoted @xmath48 . under our scenario a , the standard method for estimating risk measures uses the unconditional distribution @xmath49 of @xmath47 , whereas the internal procedure takes advantage of the information contained in @xmath46 and uses the conditional distribution @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath50 and @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 denote the density and the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution , respectively . under scenario b , </S>",
    "<S> the roles of the standard method and the internal procedure are interchanged .    </S>",
    "<S> we use sample size @xmath54 and repeat the experiment 10,000 times . as tests of traditional type , we consider the coverage test for @xmath55 described by the @xcite and the generalized coverage test for @xmath56 proposed by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as shown by @xcite , the latter performs similarly to the approaches of @xcite and @xcite , but is easier to implement . </S>",
    "<S> the outcome of the test is structured into green , yellow , and red zones , as described in the aforementioned references . for the comparative backtest for @xmath57 </S>",
    "<S> , we use the functions @xmath20 and @xmath58 in and define the zones as implied by figure [ fig:1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our comparative backtest for @xmath55 uses the function @xmath59 in , which is equivalent to putting @xmath20 and @xmath60 in . for @xmath39 in the test statistic @xmath41 in we use the standard estimator .    </S>",
    "<S> .percentage of decisions in the green , yellow , and red zone in traditional and comparative backtests . under scenario </S>",
    "<S> a , a decision in the green zone is desirable and in the joint interest of banks and regulators . under scenario b </S>",
    "<S> , the red zone corresponds to a decision in the joint interest of all stakeholders . </S>",
    "<S> [ tab:1 ] [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table [ tab:1 ] summarizes the simulation results under scenario a and b , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the traditional backtests are performed for the internal model in the scenario at hand . under scenario </S>",
    "<S> a , the four tests give broadly equivalent results . </S>",
    "<S> the benefits of the comparative approach become apparent under scenario b , where the traditional approach yields highly undesirable decisions in accepting a simplistic internal model , while a more informative standard model would be available . </S>",
    "<S> this can neither be in banks nor in regulators interests . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that this problem will arise with any traditional backtest , as a traditional backtest assesses optimality only with respect to the information used for providing the risk measure estimates .    </S>",
    "<S> comparative tests based on test statistics of the form @xmath41 in can be used to compare forecasts in the form of full predictive distributions , provided a proper scoring rule is used @xcite , or to compare risk assessments , provided the risk measure admits a strictly consistent scoring function , so elicitability is crucial . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> proper scoring rules and consistent scoring functions are sensitive to increasing information utilized for prediction ; see @xcite . however , as consistent scoring functions are not unique , a question of prime practical interest is which functions ought to be used in regulatory settings or internally .    </S>",
    "<S> arguably , now may be the time to revisit and investigate fundamental statistical issues in banking supervision . </S>",
    "<S> chances are that comparative backtests , where a bank s internal risk model is held accountable relative to an agreed - upon standardised approach , turn out to be beneficial to all stakeholders , including banks , regulators , and society at large . </S>"
