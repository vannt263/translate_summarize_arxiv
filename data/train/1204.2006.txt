    "since the discovery of high - tc superconductivity , @xcite there has been a growing interest in the properties of correlated two - dimensional ( 2d ) electronic systems .",
    "@xcite within this context , the hubbard model @xcite has received a lot of attention since it is considered one of the simplest models still containing the relevant physics .",
    "@xcite renewed interest in the hubbard hamiltonian also comes from recent experiments @xcite with cold fermionic atoms in optical lattices which open the possibility for direct simulations of the model with lattice emulators .",
    "@xcite hubbard - like models are also relevant to describe electronic properties within the active research field of graphene .",
    "@xcite    the repulsive hubbard hamiltonian is a very interesting model in theoretical physics . on the one hand , neither its hopping ( one - body ) nor its on - site interaction ( two - body ) terms favor any interesting magnetic ordering . on the other hand ,",
    "when both of them combine into the full hamiltonian a rich variety of interesting phenomena is displayed , for example , correlation - driven metal - insulator transitions , @xcite ferromagnetism , @xcite deviations from the standard fermi - liquid results , @xcite long - wavelength collective modes @xcite and spatially inhomogeneous phases .",
    "@xcite the dimensionality of the model also challenges the theoretical tools at our disposal .",
    "exact analytical solutions exist in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) case @xcite whereas the present knowledge of the basic quantum mechanical properties of the 2d hubbard hamiltonian relies , to a large extent , on numerical techniques applied to the hamiltonian itself or to its strong coupling approximations , i.e. , the t - j , t - j@xmath4 and heisenberg models .",
    "@xcite in particular , for the case of the full 2d hubbard hamiltonian , a very efficient lanczos algorithm , @xcite based on the classification of all the irreducible representations of the space group , has allowed systematic studies in the @xmath1 lattice .",
    "going beyond the present limits of exact diagonalization ( ed ) techniques requires a truncation strategy .",
    "a key issue is then how to truncate the model space while still being able to retain the most important degrees of freedom relevant for the description of a particular ground and/or excited state .",
    "nowadays there are several methods at our disposal , some of them already heavily used to study 1d and 2d hubbard models with variable degree of success .",
    "one that has been used with great success is the quantum monte carlo @xcite ( qmc ) approach .",
    "another is the density matrix renormalization group @xcite ( dmrg ) scheme that represents a very powerful and general decimation prescription . currently , the dmrg algorithm is understood as an energy minimization within a class of low entanglement wavefunctions known as matrix product states @xcite ( mps ) establishing an exciting link with quantum information perpectives . @xcite a very flexible entanglement encoding is also provided by the rapidly expanding research area of tensor network states @xcite ( tns ) .",
    "variational principles also offer very powerful methods to study hubbard - like models .",
    "for example , the dynamical variational principle , @xcite expressed in the language of green s functions and self - energies , @xcite provides us with the variational cluster approximation @xcite ( vca ) , the dynamical impurity approximation @xcite ( dia ) and the dynamical mean field theory @xcite ( dmft ) . within this context",
    ", the self - energy - functional theory @xcite ( sft ) has emerged as a conceptual framework in which the vca , dia and dmft , as well as several extensions of them , can be specified by the choice of a reference system . in particular , the cluster extensions to dmft have provided important insights into the physics of the 2d hubbard model in aspects such as the mott - hubbard transition , the pseudogap in doped systems , and the phase diagram itself.@xcite dmft and its cluster extensions are particularly valuable as they have been shown to be complementary to finite size simulations , @xcite including ours . here , we also refer the interested reader to recent work @xcite where a hierarchy of truncated configuration interaction ( ci ) expansions has been considered as a solver for quantum impurity models and dmft .    in the present work ,",
    "we explore an alternative avenue not only to describe ground state properties of the 2d hubbard model but also to access excitation spectra which represent a basic fingerprint of quantum mechanical correlations in the considered lattices . a first step in this direction , based on symmetry - projected configuration mixing ideas originally employed in microscopic nuclear structure theory ,",
    "@xcite was undertaken for the 1d hubbard model @xcite and is extended in the present work to the 2d hubbard hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) .    for a given single - electron space",
    ", we construct the most general unitary hartree - fock ( hf ) transformation .",
    "@xcite since this hf - transformation mixes all the spin and linear momentum quantum numbers of the single - electron basis states , the corresponding slater determinant deliberately breaks the original spin and translational symmetries of the 2d hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , as such , our symmetry - broken slater determinant can be considered as a convenient mean - field starting point enlarging the space of trial wave functions .",
    "@xcite we restore the broken translational and spin symmetries with the help of linear and angular momentum projection operators .",
    "this symmetry restoration recovers the multi - determinantal character in our trial state keeping good spin and linear momentum quantum numbers .",
    "the ritz variational principle @xcite is then applied to the projected energy , i.e. , ours is a variation - after - projection ( vap ) scheme .",
    "this procedure provides us with the optimal ( variational ) representation of a ground state , with well defined spin and linear momentum quantum numbers , via a single symmetry - projected configuration .",
    "our vap scheme is also very close in spirit to projected quasiparticle theory @xcite ( pqt ) and is related to other variational approaches.@xcite        in order to describe excited states with well defined quantum numbers , we construct a truncated basis consisting of a few ( orthonormalized ) symmetry - projected states throughout a chain of vap calculations .",
    "this can be easily done , still with low computational cost , due to the simple structure of our projected wave functions .",
    "finally , a further diagonalization of the 2d hubbard hamiltonian is performed within such a basis . with this configuration mixing procedure",
    "we may account , in a similar fashion , for additional correlations in both ground and excited states .",
    "in addition , our theoretical framework can be used to study important dynamical properties of the 2d hubbard hamiltonian like spectral functions .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we have three main goals .",
    "first , we present the methodology of a vap configuration mixing scheme , originally devised for the nuclear many - body problem , but not yet explored for the 2d hubbard model . therefore , in sec . [ theory ] we introduce our theoretical formalism .",

    "as opposed to the half - filled case , the particle - hole symmetry in the dos is removed when doping is present in the system . from the calculations for 14 electrons in the @xmath1 lattice we conclude that for on - site repulsions smaller than the noninteracting bandwidth the ( half - filling ) gap dissapears , a pseudogap develops around u=8 t while the gap is not filled for larger u values .",
    "these results agree well with similar conclusions extracted from lanczos calculations .",
    "@xcite we have also found the remarkable result that all the lowest - lying s=1/2 states in the spectrum of the @xmath1 lattice with 15 electrons can be reasonably well described by a wave function of the form ( [ hole - wf - spectral ] ) in which no orbital relaxation is accounted for .",
    "one important feature of the scheme presented in this study is that it leaves ample space for further improvements and research .",
    "first , the number of symmetry - projected configurations in our basis set can be easily increased .",
    "second , we could still incorporate particle number symmetry breaking and restoration in our configuration mixing scheme to access even more correlations .",
    "our methods could be useful even for more complicated lattices like the honeycomb one .",
    "an extension of the considered 2d t - u hubbard hamiltonian to the @xmath282 case is also straightforward , allowing the study of several interesting issues like indications of spin - charge separation in 2d systems ( see , for example , ref .",
    "65 and references therein ) .",
    "last but not least , not only the configuration mixing scheme applied in the present work but also the full hierarchy of approximations discussed in ref .",
    "43 can be implemented for the molecular hamiltonian in the realm of quantum chemistry , within the already successful pqt .",
    "@xcite work along these avenues is in progress .",
    "we would like to stress that the cost of the symmetry - projected calculations described in this work has the same scaling as mean - field methods .",
    "@xcite this statement is true as long as the number of grid points required in the symmetry restoration remains relatively constant ( this is usually the case for spin and number projection ) .",
    "note , however , that the restoration of translational symmetry in hubbard lattices with pbc requires a number of grid points equal to @xmath187 .",
    "this makes the cost of our calculations @xmath283 more expensive than the hartree - fock method , which is still a very reasonable scaling .",
    "the computational effort is mainly concentrated in looping over grid points for the evaluation of matrix elements .",
    "this task is trivially parallelizable and one can thus easily reach clusters larger than the ones considered in this study .",
    "preliminary calculations for the half - filled and doped @xmath126 and @xmath127 lattices are in progress .",
    "a discussion of the limitations of our method is also in order here .",
    "evidently , our method relies on the hamiltonian having good symmetries .",
    "the lower the number of symmetries of a given hamiltonian , the lower the correlations that can be accounted for by means of symmetry restoration . on the other hand ,",
    "the most interesting quantum behavior is found in systems where symmetries are present .",
    "second , it is known that the correlation energy per particle obtained with approaches based on a single symmetry - projected determinant @xcite decays as the lattice size increases .",
    "we observe that the error in the energy per site is larger in the case of the half - filled @xmath2 lattice than in the @xmath1 one , although in both cases we have restricted the present study to @xmath104=5 transformations .",
    "one can , however , increase the number of transformations to maintain the quality of our wave functions . in principle , if the number of transformations is equal to the size of the restricted hilbert subspace the method becomes exact . in practice",
    ", one can only hope that the number of transformations needed to access the relevant physics of the considered lattices is relatively low .",
    "finally , we believe that the finite size calculations discussed in the present work are complementary to other approaches where impurity solvers play an important role . however , the symmetries to be broken and restored in the impurity - bath and bath hamiltonians will depend on the details of the case considered .",
