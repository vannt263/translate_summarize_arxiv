    "blending of polymeric substances is a straightforward and inexpensive way of creating new materials with improved mechanical properties@xcite .",
    "however , long polymers of different type @xmath0 and @xmath1 are often immiscible already at high temperatures , since the total energy of the ( usually repulsive ) relative interaction is proportional to the total number of monomers and can not be balanced by the entropy of mixing , which is proportional to the number of polymers in the mixture@xcite . in order to overcome this problem ,",
    "block copolymers containing both types of monomers can be used as effective compatibilizers@xcite .",
    "being partly compatible with both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 rich phase , they tend to aggregate at interfaces , where they reduce the number of direct contacts between @xmath0 and @xmath1 homopolymers , thereby reducing the interfacial tension@xcite .",
    "consequently the total area of interfaces increases , and the immiscible components may get finely dispersed in the mixture .",

    "i.e. _ , the maximum reduction of the interfacial tension it can achieve , increases with the length of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 blocks relative to the size of the homopolymers",
    ". mean field theories predict that the interfacial tension can be driven to zero for long copolymers , which implies that the copolymer rich lamellar phase evolves into the two - phase region via a continuous unbinding transition@xcite .",
    "fluctuations push the transition to first order in real systems@xcite .",
    "one can argue that the low interfacial tensions at the presence of copolymers result from the affinity of the system to such an unbinding transition@xcite .",
    "this macroscopic discussion however does not shed light on the microscopic mechanisms , why and how copolymers work as compatibilizer or amphiphiles . in a simple microscopic picture",
    ", the @xmath0 block of copolymers at interfaces preferably stick into the @xmath0-rich phase , the @xmath1 block into the @xmath1-rich phase , and the molecules as a whole act as reinforcing rods@xcite .",

    "the presence of copolymers at the interface gives rise to two free energy contributions : the entropy of mixing , divided into a translational term and a swelling term , and the elastic energy of stretching of the copolymer blocks .",
    "a scenario emerges which distinguishes between four different regimes : in the dilute regime , copolymers aggregate at the interface , but do not yet overlap .",

    "less transparent , but more accurate mean field approaches are the self consistent field theories@xcite or the density functional theories@xcite .",
    "the self consistent field theory has first been applied to copolymer - homopolymer interfaces by noolandi and hong@xcite and adjusted to the case of a blend without solvent by shull and kramer@xcite .",
    "it has been shown to be quantitatively successful in predicting the correct copolymer excess at the interface , using a @xmath2-parameter which is taken from independent bulk measurements@xcite .",

    "we restrict ourselves to the diluted case , where the copolymer coils do almost not overlap , and where the static structure of the interface is essentially that of a pure homopolymer interface . the results are compared to self consistent field theory calculations for a single copolymer in a homopolymer interface .",

    "fortunately , many important features of such systems are already apparent in coarse grained models@xcite , such as the bond fluctuation model on a cubic lattice@xcite .",

    "the main quantitative discrepancy was found in the interfacial width  at chain length @xmath34 , the self consistent field theory underestimates the profile widths by at least a factor of @xmath48 .",
    "this effect could not be explained by capillary waves alone , but seemed to be a consequence of the short chain length . at temperatures sufficiently below the critical point , so that critical fluctuations do not affect the interface any more , the interfacial width gets already comparable to the screening length of the excluded volume , on which length scale chains can not be treated as pure random walks .",
    "this leads to wrong predictions of the size of the interface . however , theory and simulations still agree quantitatively for other quantities , e.g. the reduction of the total density at the interface .",

    "the distribution of copolymer segments is calculated by solving appropriate diffusion equations for the end segment distributions @xmath66 and @xmath67 for chain parts of length @xmath68 , which begin on the @xmath0 side ( @xmath69 ) or the @xmath1 side ( @xmath70 ) of the copolymer@xcite . from those one",

    "the numerical treatment is facilitated by expanding the functions @xmath69 , @xmath70 in legendre polynomials and including only the three lowest moments@xcite .",
    "all results presented here were obtained at @xmath12 or @xmath74 , _ i.e. _ , the system is far from the critical point ( @xmath75  @xcite ) in the strong segregation regime .",
    "simulations were also performed at @xmath76 ; the results are qualitatively the same , but the effects are less marked .    in the following ,",
    "lengths are given in units of @xmath77 , the interfacial width of a homopolymer interface in the mean field strong segregation limit .",
    "the radius of gyration in these units is @xmath78 , and the slab thickness @xmath79 .",
    "figure 1 shows profiles of @xmath0 and @xmath1 monomer densities in systems with and without copolymers , profiles of just the @xmath0 and @xmath1 blocks of the copolymers , and total density profiles .",
    "as expected in the diluted regime , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 monomer density profiles are hardly affected by the presence of the copolymers .",
    "the interface as a whole is still very similar to a pure homopolymer interface . due to the finite compressibility of the blend ,",
    "the total density is slightly reduced in the interfacial region@xcite .",
    "the distributions of copolymer monomers @xmath0 and @xmath1 agree qualitatively with the experimental results and confirm the simple picture presented in the introduction : monomers of type @xmath0 are more concentrated in the @xmath0-rich phase , monomers of type @xmath1 in the @xmath1 rich - phase .",
    "the distribution is rather broad , a fair portion of the @xmath0 monomers sticks into the @xmath1-rich phase and vice versa .",
    "distributions of single chain segments are shown in figure 2 and 3 . for homopolymers ,",
    "one finds a relative enrichment of chain ends @xmath80 at the interface , whereas the concentration @xmath81 of middle segments ( the 16th and 17th monomer ) is comparatively low there . the total density profile @xmath82 is best reproduced by the density profiles @xmath83 of the segments at one and three fourth of the chain ( the 8th and 25th monomer ) .",
    "looking at the higher concentration of chain ends at the interface , one is lead to suspect that homopolymers tend to form loops with two ends at the interface .",
    "however , this is not the case , as can be seen from the distribution @xmath84 of midpoints between the two ends of homopolymers .",
    "it is strongly reduced at the center of the interface and enhanced at the distance of one gyration radius from there ( figure 2 ) .",
    "copolymer segment densities show the inverse trend : the middle segments concentrate at the interface , whereas the chain ends stretch out into their favorite bulk phase .",
    "hence our results are in qualitative agreement with the experimental findings of russell et al  @xcite . as in the case of homopolymers , the total density profiles of @xmath0 and @xmath1 monomers are almost identical with the distribution of the 8th and 25th monomer , respectively , _",
    "i.e. _ , the distribution of segments in the middle of the @xmath0 or @xmath1 block .",
    "note that the peak of the distribution of middle segments @xmath81 is relatively broad , broader than the radius of gyration , hence they are not strongly confined to the interface as assumed by the leibler theory ( figure 3 ) .",
    "the results of the self consistent field theory are shown in the inset .",
    "the fact that the scft underestimates the interfacial width also leads to quantitative discrepancies in the distribution of copolymer segments .",
    "however , the qualitative agreement is very good , and in the wings of the profile one even reaches quantitative agreement .",
    "next we discuss the orientational properties of the polymers .",
    "it is instructive to consider separately the orientations of single bonds , of chain segments , and of whole chains .",
    "chains with rather weakly oriented single bonds can still be strongly oriented as a whole , as found by mller et al for homopolymers at a homopolymer interface@xcite .",
    "the orientation of whole chains involves two different factors .",
    "first , chains may be oriented without volume changes , _",
    "i.e. _ , the total gyration radius or end - to - end vector remains unaffected by the orientation .",
    "a weak orienting field is sufficient to bring about orientation of this kind .",
    "second , chains may get compressed or stretched in one direction . as figure 4 illustrates",
    ", the latter effect dominates close to an interface .",
    "the mean squared components of the end - to - end vector in directions parallel ( @xmath25,@xmath26 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath27 ) to the interface are shown for homopolymers and copolymers .",
    "the components parallel to the interface hardly vary throughout the system .",
    "perpendicular to the interface , the end - to - end vector of homopolymers is reduced in the interfacial region , as is already the case in pure homopolymer systems .",
    "homopolymers are thus squeezed perpendicular to the interface , and get effectively oriented parallel to the interface .",
    "copolymers show the inverse behavior , they stretch in the direction perpendicular to the interface .",
    "as obtained both from self consistent field calculations and from the simulations , the effect is very strong for copolymers centered at about one to two radii of gyration away from the interface , and much weaker for those located in the wings of profile or at the middle of the interface ( figure 4 ) .",
    "one can picture the latter as consisting of two almost independent homopolymer blocks , which hardly feel the effect of being linked together at one end .",
    "indeed , the vector connecting the ends of the single @xmath0 or @xmath1 blocks is on average hardly oriented ( table 1 ) .",
    "only the blocks centered deep in their majority phase ( @xmath85 ) stretch perpendicular to the interface , since they are pulled towards the interface by the other copolymer end ( figure 5 ) .",
    "note that figure 5 also demonstrates , how minority blocks ( @xmath0 blocks in the @xmath1 phase , @xmath1 blocks in the @xmath0 phase ) slightly shrink by a factor of approximately 0.8 due to the hostile environment .",
    "the vector @xmath86 connecting the centers of mass of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 blocks is on average oriented and strongly stretched in the negative @xmath27 direction ( table 1 ) .    in sum",
    ", single blocks are mostly not oriented at all ; the perpendicular orientation of whole copolymers results from the arrangement of the two constituent blocks .",
    "diblock copolymers can be pictured as dumbbells@xcite consisting of two mildly perturbed homopolymer coils .",
    "similar copolymer shapes have already been found by binder and fried in simulations of block copolymers in the disordered phase , far above the ordering transition@xcite .",
    "consequently , one would expect that the only region , where the local conformation of a diblock differs significantly from a homopolymer conformation , is the region close to the link which connects the two blocks .",
    "we study this in more detail by looking at the orientation of single bonds @xmath87 . in order to do so",
    ", it is useful to define a bond orientation parameter @xmath88 negative @xmath89 implies orientation parallel to the interface , positive @xmath89 perpendicular orientation .",
    "the orientations of homopolymer bonds are shown in figure 6 . like whole chains , but to a much lesser extent , bonds tend to align themselves parallel to the interface . unlike the end - to - end vector of whole chains , the average squared bond length @xmath90 varies by less than @xmath91 throughout the system ( not shown here ) , hence the bond length is quasi fixed , the bonds get oriented without compression .",
    "the effect is strongest in the middle of the chains and qualitatively the same , but weaker for end bonds .",
    "the bond orientation parameter can be compared to the average orientation of the tangent vector @xmath71 predicted by the self consistent field theory @xmath92 .",
    "the results show the same trend as the simulation data for the middle bonds , but do not predict any effect for the end bonds ( figure 6 , inset ) , unlike what is seen in the mc simulations .",
    "this reflects the difference between the tangent vector at the end of a continuous space curve , as assumed by scft , and an end bond connecting two discrete statistical monomers of a relatively short chain , as it is the case in our mc simulation .",
    "in contrast to homopolymer chains , mc data reveal a rather strong dependence of the orientation of bonds in copolymers on their position within the chain ( figure 7a ) . the bond which links the two blocks",
    "is preferably oriented perpendicular to the interface  the stronger , the further away its location from the center of the interface .",
    "already the bonds next to the link bond show a much smaller effect .",
    "the larger the distance along the chain from the link bond , the stronger the tendency of parallel alignment at the center of the interface becomes , and the further it reaches out into the wings of the profile . hence bonds in the middle and at the end of an @xmath0 or @xmath1 block behave very much like homopolymer bonds .",
    "we note _ en passant _ that , compared to the other bonds , the link bond is stretched by @xmath93 due to the relative repulsion between the adjacent @xmath0 and @xmath1 monomers .",
    "the results obtained by scft show the same trends as the simulation data ( figure 7b ) , and agree qualitatively , but the same remarks as above apply .",
    "thus , scft does not reproduce the slight tendency of parallel alignment which is found in the mc data at the ends of the blocks .",
    "the orientational parameter of the link bond at the center of the profile is @xmath94 according to both mc results and scft .",
    "however , scft underestimates the average orientation ( averaged over link bonds in the region shown in figure 7a ) by @xmath95 . at distances of several gyration radii @xmath24 from the interface ,",
    "the bond orientation parameter @xmath89 drops back to zero , indicating that copolymers that deep in the bulk are oblivious to the effect of the interface .",
    "note that two different length scales are reflected in the profiles of @xmath89 .",
    "one of them , the width of the homopolymer interface , fixes the width of the central dip in the profiles , the other one , the gyration radius , determines the overall width of the region with nonzero @xmath89 .",
    "another instructive quantity in the bond fluctuation model is the number of monomer `` contacts '' , _",
    "i.e. _ , the number of interacting monomer pairs",
    ". it is expedient to distinguish between `` self contacts '' , _",
    "i.e. _ , contacts between monomers belonging to the same chain ( `` intrachain contacts '' ) , and `` interchain contacts '' of monomers from two different chains . the self contacts provide additional information on the conformation of single chains , and the interchain contacts on the arrangement of chains relative to each other .",
    "figure 8 compares the number of self contacts per monomer @xmath96 in homopolymer ( @xmath97 ) and copolymer ( @xmath98 ) chains .",
    "the main contribution to @xmath96 comes from the two direct neighbors of a monomer in the chain , thus @xmath96 is mostly slightly larger than 2 .",
    "note however that direct neighbors do not always interact with each other , since the maximum bond length @xmath99 is larger than the range of the interactions @xmath11 .",
    "the number of self contacts in homopolymers is almost constant throughout the system .",
    "it is slightly enhanced in the wings of the profile and decreases again at the center , where @xmath0 and @xmath1 meet  suggesting that homopolymer chains tend to loop away from the interface , such that there is no room for intrachain contacts at the center , but that the number of contacts increases right next to it . in copolymers , one finds the opposite behavior  the relative number of intrachain contacts is higher at the center of the interface than in homopolymers , but diminishes rapidly as one moves away from the interface .",
    "this trend is promoted by three factors .",
    "first , far from the interface copolymers stretch towards the interface , and the number of self contacts associated with backfolding goes down .",
    "second , the stretching goes along with a higher occupation of the @xmath100 bond , which is outside of the interaction region , hence monomers gradually lose contact to their direct neighbors .",
    "third , the further away one moves from the interface , the greater becomes the contribution of chain end monomers , which only have one direct neighbor in the chain .",
    "obviously , it would be highly desirable to study separately the contributions to @xmath96 from monomers which are direct neighbors in a chain , and from monomers which are further apart from each other .",
    "unfortunately , such a distinction was not possible due to limited memory space .    whereas the number of self contacts reflects the conformational properties of a chain , the demixing of @xmath0 and @xmath1 chains in the melt is essentially driven by the interchain contacts .",
    "the number of interchain contacts per monomer can be interpreted as an effective coordination number @xmath101 . in homogeneous systems , the identification @xmath102 makes contact with the flory - huggins theory@xcite . in inhomogeneous systems ,",
    "the effective coordination number is position dependent . as long as the finite range of interactions is neglected",
    ", mean field theory simply asserts that it is proportional to the local density of monomers : @xmath103 a more elaborated mean field approach predicts for a system which is inhomogeneous in one direction @xmath27 @xcite , @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the integrable part of the interaction potential ( _ i.e. _ , excluding the hard core part ) and @xmath106 the normalized pair correlation function . since the interaction region extends no further than @xmath107 , an upper bound for the factor @xmath108 is given by @xmath109 .",
    "figure 1 shows that @xmath110 .",
    "hence the expected deviation from the simple proportionality law ( [ z ] ) is of order @xmath111 .",
    "furthermore , one would expect that the effective coordination number does not depend on whether a monomer belongs to a copolymer or a homopolymer .",
    "in contrast to these considerations , the monte carlo data reveal a much lower dip of the reduced coordination number @xmath112 ( figure 9 ) at the center of the interface .",
    "the discrepancy between mean field assumption and simulation data becomes even more manifest when looking at the number of contacts @xmath113 between @xmath0 and @xmath1 monomers . from the usual mean field assumption",
    ", one would expect @xmath114 ( figure 10 ) .",
    "the simulation data however show that @xmath115 is increased by a factor of @xmath116 , compared to the bulk value , at the distance of approximately two radii of gyration from the interface , where the chains are stretched ( cf .",
    "figure 5 ) . at the center of the interface ,",
    "on the other hand , it is decreased by @xmath117 .",
    "one can deduce that chains are compactified in the interfacial region .",
    "interestingly , this holds particularly for copolymer chains .",
    "we recall that the number of _ intra_chain contacts in copolymers is enhanced at the interface , whereas the _ inter_chain contacts are obviously suppressed .",
    "thus copolymers offer relatively little `` active surface '' for interaction with external monomers in the interfacial region .",
    "in contrast , the relative number of external contacts increases further away from the interface .",
    "hence the active surface per monomer will presumably increase with the copolymer chain length .",
    "this may be an additional reason why short copolymers are relatively poor amphiphiles .",
    "we have studied the ternary system of @xmath0 and @xmath1 homopolymers and symmetric @xmath118 diblock copolymers close to an @xmath0/@xmath1 interface in the dilute regime , where copolymer coils do almost not overlap with each other , by monte carlo simulations of the bond fluctuation model . in this regime , the structural properties of the interface are not altered with respect to the pure homopolymer interface  in particular , we find no significant broadening of the interfacial width , as is expected at higher copolymer concentrations .",
    "according to our simulation results , copolymers resemble oriented dumbells with the @xmath0 block sticking into the @xmath0 rich phase , and the @xmath1 block sticking into the @xmath1 rich phase .",
    "the conformations of single blocks are not very different from conformations of pure homopolymer coils .",
    "single blocks tend to orient themselves parallel to the interface , like homopolymers , whereas copolymers as a whole are oriented perpendicular to the interface . when looking at the orientations of single bonds , we find that the orientational properties of the central bond , which links the two blocks , differ distinctly from those of a homopolymer bond , but that already the neighboring bonds behave very similar to homopolymer bonds .",
    "hence the chain loses the memory of the link very rapidly .",
    "our results are reproduced qualitatively , but not quantitatively , by a self consistent field calculation .",
    "furthermore , we found that copolymers are unusually compact in the interfacial region , _",
    "i.e. _ , monomers have more contacts to monomers of the same chain , and fewer contacts to monomers of different chains than monomers in the bulk phase . as a result ,",
    "the copolymer - copolymer interchain contacts are particularly suppressed at the interface .",
    "this should become important as the concentration of copolymers is increased . future work",
    "will be concerned with the structure of interfaces with higher content of copolymers and with the transition between different regimes , from the dilute to the wet brush to the dry brush regime , until the two phase region breaks down and a lamellar phase emerges .",
    "we thank h. weber for invaluable help in solving some computational problems .",
