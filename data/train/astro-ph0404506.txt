    "broad , double - peaked balmer lines are found in the spectra of approximately 2025% of radio - loud agns at @xmath0 ( @xcite , @xcite ) and in the spectra of 4% of _ all _ agns at @xmath1 from the sloan digital sky survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "half of these profiles are well described by kinematic models of axisymmetric , relativistic , keplerian disks ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , while the other half require a modified version of this model in which the disk is not axisymmetric ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the hosts of double - peaked emission lines ( hereafter the `` double - peaked emitters '' ) share a number of distinguishing characteristics which make them stand out from the average agn and suggest that these objects represent the extreme end of the distribution of agn properties , namely : ( a ) balmer line widths that are , on average , twice as large as those of other agns , ( b ) steep broad - line balmer decrements , ( c ) unusually strong low - ionization emission lines ( i.e. , [ ] and [ ] ) , as well as unusually large [ ] / [ ] ratios , and ( d ) a great deal of starlight in the optical continuum .",
    "these characteristics support the scenario of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chen & halpern ( 1989 ) ) in which the inner accretion in these objects is an ion torus ( @xcite ; known today as a radiatively inefficient accretion flow ) .",
    "some of the spectroscopic properties of double - peaked emitters are reminiscent of liners and the relation between the two groups is underscored by the detection of double - peaked balmer lines in several liners .",
    "uv spectra of several bright double - peaked emitters were observed with the _",
    "hst s _ fos and stis instruments in order to compare the profiles of the high- and low - ionization uv emission lines with those of the balmer lines , as well as to detect and study the shape of the uv continuum .",
    "the results of the observations of the prototypical object , arp  102b , were presented and discussed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* halpern et al . ( 1996 ) ) , while work on the other objects is in progress .",
    "a study of the spectral energy distribution of one of these objects , ngc  1097 , is presented by nemmen et al .",
    ", in this volume .",
    "the line is the only uv line with a double - peaked profile , while all the other uv lines are single - peaked .",
    "this is shown in figure  1 , where we compare the balmer and uv line profiles of three representative objects .",
    "particularly striking is the dramatic difference between the profiles of the ly@xmath2 and balmer lines . in 2/3 of the objects ( exemplified by pks  0921213 in fig .  1 ) , the far - uv resonance lines are strong , with single - peaked profiles resembling those of seyfert galaxies . in the remaining objects ( e.g. , arp  102b and ngc  1097 in fig .  1 ) , the far - uv resonance lines are relatively weak but still single - peaked",
    ". the emission - line profiles of arp  102b also serve to illustrate that there are at least two broad - emission line regions in the same object . in particular",
    ", the profile of the h@xmath2 line can be decomposed into a very broad , double - peaked part which has no counterpart in the ly@xmath2 line , and a bell - shaped part of intermediate width , which closely resembles the ly@xmath2 profile .",
    "the double - peaked part can be attributed to emission from the dense , low - ionization gas in the accretion disk .",
    "the extremely weak ly@xmath2 emission from the disk was actually predicted by the models of weakly photoionized accretion disks by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* collin - souffrin & dumont ( 1989 ) and dumont & collin - souffrin ( 1990 ) ) : at the high densities and column densities of the accretion disk ly@xmath2 photons are trapped by resonance scattering and the @xmath3 level of hydrogen is deexcited by collisions , thus the ly@xmath2 photons are effectively lost . on the other hand balmer - line photons",
    "can escape relatively easily .",
    "the bell - shaped component can be ascribed to a medium of lower density and higher ionization , presumably a wind overlaying the disk .",
    "the propagation of the line photons through the accelerating wind results in a non - axisymmetric emissivity pattern as seen by the observer .",
    "thus , the emission - line profiles from the wind are single - peaked , even though the dominant motion of the gas is rotational ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also discovered and associated absorption - line complexes in the uv spectra of some of the double - peaked emitters , as shown in figure  2 .",
    "particularly interesting are the uv3536 and uv6164 multiplets , which arise from metastable lower levels located about 1  ev above the ground state .",
    "the absorption lines are blueshifted by about 100200 km s@xmath4 relative to the systemic velocity , which suggests that they originate in an outflow .",
    "the case of arp  102b was studied in great detail by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eracleous et al . ( 2003 ) ) who used x - ray observations to constrain the column density of the absorber and constructed photoionization models to investigate its structure .",
    "one of the main conclusions of that work was that the absorber is very likely to be a dense , low - ionization medium ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) , located just above the line - emitting portion of the accretion disk .",
    "moreover , the absorber is likely to have the form of dense filaments , perhaps embedded in a lower - density , higher - ionization outflow .",
    "thus the absorption lines trace an outflowing wind from the accretion disk , which is probably connected to the medium responsible for the single - peaked far - uv emission lines .",
    "the uv spectra of double - peaked emitters also lead to a number of general insights into agn broad - line regions and they suggest a way of connecting double - peaked emitters with the greater agn population . in this scheme , which is illustrated schematically in figure  3 , luminous agns ( such as seyfert galaxies and quasars ) accrete at a rate that is a substantial fraction of the eddington rate ( @xmath7 ) . thus they produce a significant wind , which is also the predominant source of broad emission lines ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the double - peaked emitters , on the other hand , are the segment of the agn population in which the accretion rate relative to the eddington rate is extremely low ( @xmath8 ) . in this extreme",
    ", the inner accretion disk turns into an ion torus , the wind diminishes , and the accretion disk is unveiled .",
    "we can exploit our direct view of the disk in double - peaked emitters to study its dynamics .",
    "this can be accomplished through long - term variability studies in which the variations of the double - peaked line profiles are compared with models of dynamical phenomena in the disk .",
    "such studies require patience and persistence , as shown in the examples presented by lewis et al . and gezari et al .",
    "in this volume ."
