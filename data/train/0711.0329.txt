    "ngc 2547 is a relatively well - studied nearby young open cluster ; we adopt the parameters of @xcite , who give an age of @xmath11 , distance modulus @xmath12 and reddening @xmath13 .",
    "the age derived by these authors puts the cluster at the approximate point where g - dwarfs reach the zero age main sequence ( zams ; see for example figure 1 of @xcite ) , and slightly younger than the typically - used benchmark of @xmath14 persei ( @xmath15 , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the small distance modulus makes it possible to probe down to very low masses , with relatively modest - sized telescopes .",
    "the cluster has been surveyed in x - rays using rosat @xcite and xmm - newton @xcite .",
    "the latter study found that the solar type stars in ngc 2547 exhibited a similar relation between x - ray activity and rossby number to field stars and older clusters , but with saturated or super - saturated x - ray activity levels , and median levels of x - ray luminosity and x - ray to bolometric luminosity ratio similar to t - tauri stars in the onc , but much higher than in the pleiades .",
    "these measures are consistent with the relative youth of ngc 2547 .    surveys of lithium depletion ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have placed constraints on the cluster age , and conversely , on stellar evolution models by comparison with isochrone fitting results .",
    "@xcite find ages based on lithium depletion of @xmath16 , reasonably consistent with the isochrone - based estimate we assumed earlier .",
    "@xcite performed a @xmath17 survey of the solar - type stars in the cluster , finding a distribution indistinguishable from that in the similar - age clusters ic 2391 and ic 2602 , with a similar rotation - activity relationship to older clusters such as the pleiades .",
    "@xcite found weak evidence for mass segregation in the cluster , confirmed by @xcite using a new photometric survey , where they also derived the cluster mass function down to @xmath18 , finding a result very similar to the pleiades mass function over the range @xmath19 .",
    "finally , ngc 2547 has been observed with using the irac and mips instruments by @xcite to investigate the cluster disc frequency .",
    "@xcite subsequently extended the survey coverage , finding only @xmath20 out of @xmath21 stars of b  mid - m spectral type to show excesses in the irac @xmath22 band , a fraction of @xmath23 per cent . in the mips @xmath24 band , they found @xmath25 per cent of the stars of b  f spectral types to show excesses .",
    "this striking result is most likely due to the discs clearing from the inside outwards , with the lack of short - wavelength excesses caused by the discs being substantially cleared within the central @xmath26 parts by the age of ngc 2547 .      for a discussion of the context of this work ,",
    "the reader is referred to our m34 and ngc 2516 publications in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the present survey probes a different open cluster of younger age ( @xmath27 for ngc 2547 , compared to @xmath28 for ngc 2516 and @xmath29 for m34 ) . due to the small distance modulus and young age , the ngc 2547 survey probes a relatively wide range of masses , covering @xmath10 , compared to @xmath30 in ngc 2516 and @xmath31 in m34",
    "this will allow a more detailed comparison with models of angular momentum evolution , and in particular to test our results in @xcite , where we found that the evolution of the fast rotators appeared to be better - reproduced by solid body models , and the slow rotators by differentially rotating models . at the age of ngc 2547 ,",
    "stars with masses @xmath32 should be fully - convective , and at @xmath33 , just beginning to develop a radiative core @xcite .",
    "we have undertaken a photometric survey in ngc 2547 using the mpg / eso 2.2 m telescope with the wide field imager ( wfi ; @xcite ) .",
    "our goals are two - fold : first , to study rotation periods for a sample of low - mass members , covering k and m spectral types , down to @xmath34 , and second , to look for eclipsing binary systems containing low - mass stars , to obtain dynamical mass measurements in conjunction with radial velocities from follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "such systems provide the most accurate determinations of fundamental stellar parameters ( in particular , masses ) for input to models of stellar evolution , which are poorly constrained in this age range . we defer discussion of our eclipsing binary candidates to a later paper once we have obtained suitable follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "these observations are part of a larger photometric monitoring survey of young open clusters over a range of ages and metalicities ( the monitor project ; @xcite and @xcite ) .",

    "photometric calibration of our data was carried out using regular observations of @xcite equatorial standard star fields in the usual way , as part of the standard eso nightly calibrations .",

    "the error bars at the left - hand side of the plot indicate the typical photometric error for an object on the cluster sequence.,width=336 ]    candidate cluster members were selected by defining an empirical cluster sequence ` by eye ' to follow the clearly - visible cluster single - star sequence .",
    "the cuts were defined by moving this line along a vector perpendicular to the cluster sequence , by amounts @xmath69 and @xmath70 as measured along this vector , where @xmath71 is the photometric error in the @xmath62 colour .",

    "the selection region used here is comparable to that of @xcite , and below @xmath79 , @xmath80 of their candidate cluster members are also selected by our cut . above @xmath79 , there are slight differences in the isochrones and due to saturation in the present sample , and the corresponding fraction is reduced to @xmath81 .",
    "we also considered using the model isochrones of @xcite and @xcite for selecting candidate members .",
    "the nextgen model isochrones were found to be unsuitable due to the known discrepancy between these models and observations in the @xmath62 colour for @xmath82 ( corresponding here to @xmath83 ) .",
    "this was examined in more detail by @xcite , and is due to a missing source of opacity at these temperatures , leading to overestimation of the @xmath3-band flux .",
    "consequently , when we have used the nextgen isochrones to determine model masses and radii for our objects , the @xmath0-band absolute magnitudes were used to perform the relevant look - up , since these are less susceptible to the missing source of opacity , and hence give more robust estimates .      in order to estimate the level of contamination in our catalogue",

    "the method we use for detection of periodic variables is described in detail in @xcite , and we provide only a brief summary here .",
    "the method uses least - squares fitting of sine curves to the time series @xmath92 ( in magnitudes ) for _ all _ candidate cluster members , using the form : @xmath93 where @xmath94 ( the dc light curve level ) , @xmath14 ( the amplitude ) and @xmath95 ( the phase ) are free parameters at each value of @xmath96 over an equally - spaced grid of frequencies , corresponding to periods from @xmath97 for the present data - set .",
    "periodic variable light curves were selected by evaluating the change in reduced @xmath98 : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the reduced @xmath98 of the original light curve with respect to a constant model , and @xmath101 is the reduced @xmath98 of the light curve with the smoothed , phase - folded version subtracted .",
    "this threshold was used for the m34 data and appears to work well here too , carefully checked by examining all the light curves for two of the detectors , chosen randomly .",
    "a total of @xmath102 objects were selected by this automated part of the procedure .",
    "the selected light curves were examined by eye , to define the final sample of periodic variables .",
    "a total of @xmath9 light curves were selected , with the remainder appearing non - variable or too ambiguous to be included .",
    "monte carlo simulations were performed following the method detailed in @xcite , injecting simulated signals of @xmath103 amplitude and periods chosen following a uniform distribution on @xmath104 period from @xmath105 to @xmath106 , into light curves covering a uniform distribution in mass , from @xmath107 to @xmath108 .",
    "a total of @xmath109 objects were simulated .",
    "the results of the simulations are shown in figure [ sim_results ] as diagrams of completeness , reliability and contamination as a function of period and stellar mass .",
    "broadly , our period detections are close to @xmath91 complete from @xmath6 down to @xmath108 , with remarkably little period dependence .",
    "figure [ periodcomp ] shows a comparison of the detected periods with real periods for our simulated objects , indicating remarkably high reliability , especially compared to the earlier data - sets ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , resulting from the extremely long time base - line of the present survey afforded by observing in service mode .        , open circles @xmath110 .",
    "the straight lines represent equal input and output periods , and factors of @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the curved lines are the loci of the @xmath115 aliases resulting from gaps during the day .",
    "the majority of the points fall on ( or close to ) the line of equal periods.,width=288 ]    these results indicate overall that the service mode observing strategy as implemented by eso performs very favourably for rotation period detection in ngc 2547 , compared to our conventional visitor mode observations ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . in particular , the sampling is very well - suited to determining extremely precise and accurate rotation periods , as illustrated in figure [ periodcomp ] .",
    "however , there are two principal disadvantages . the long time span of the observations , and sparse sampling , here over @xmath116 , means the process of period detection is complicated by the evolution of the spot patterns on the stellar surfaces giving rise to the photometric modulations .",
    "this has the effect of modifying the amplitude and phase of the variability , and may occur over timescales of a few months .",
    "this has not been accounted for in the simulations .",
    "qualitatively , this effect may reduce the overall detection rate since the variations will not produce a smooth phase - folded light curve for any plausible period , and will therefore be rejected in the detection process .",
    "furthermore , for eclipsing binary detection this is obviously a serious problem , since the variations become much more difficult to remove when searching for shallow eclipses .",
    "the second problem relates to the observing conditions .",
    "since desired weather conditions are specified for a service mode proposal , and differential photometry does not require the best observing conditions , a service mode programme will in general receive poorer conditions than a visitor mode programme performed in good weather ( e.g. the ngc 2516 survey ; @xcite ) . for rotation period detection at reasonable amplitudes ,",
    "the simulations indicate that this is not a serious issue",
    ". however , poor seeing and particularly poor transparency , increase the level of low - amplitude correlated noise in the light curves ( see @xcite ) , which severely impedes detection of shallow transit events .",
    "the effects of both these factors on transit detection will be evaluated in more detail in a future publication presenting our eclipse candidates .",
    "the locations of our detected periodic variable candidate cluster members on a @xmath3 versus @xmath4 cmd of ngc 2547 are shown in figure [ cands_on_cmd ] .",
    "the diagram indicates that the majority of the detections lie on the single - star cluster sequence , as would be expected for rotation in cluster stars as opposed to , say , eclipsing binaries .     versus @xmath62 cmd of ngc 2547 , for objects with stellar morphological classification , as figure [ cmd ] , showing all @xmath9 candidate cluster members with detected periods ( black points ) .",
    "the dashed lines show the cuts used to select candidate cluster members ( see  [ cmd_section]).,width=336 ]    figure [ fracper ] shows the fraction of cluster members with detected periods as a function of @xmath3 magnitude .",
    "the decaying parts of the histogram at the bright and faint ends may be caused by the increased field contamination here ( see figure [ contam ] ) , since we expect field objects on average show less rotational modulation than cluster objects , and/or incompleteness effects resulting from saturation for @xmath117 , and for @xmath118 , the gradual increase in the minimum amplitude of variations we can detect ( corresponding to the reduction in sensitivity moving to fainter stars , see figure [ rmsplot ] ) .",
    "complete for @xmath119 ( shown by the vertical dashed lines ) , or for the effects of field contamination.,width=288 ]    in the m34 survey of @xcite , we commented on a possible increase in the fraction of photometric variables from @xmath120 to @xmath121 spectral types , subject to a large uncertainty due to small number statistics .",
    "this feature was also seen in the ngc 2516 survey @xcite , and the three distributions look qualitatively very similar after correcting for the different mass ranges covered , with a rise in the fraction of periodic objects detected at spectral types of @xmath122 m0 .",
    "however , in all three cases , this is also the point at which the cluster sequence becomes well - separated from the field in the cmd analysis , corresponding to a reduction in field contamination moving toward later spectral types .",
    "it is therefore difficult to say if the trend is significant from the present observations .",
    "likewise , lower field contamination is expected in the rotation sample than in the full candidate membership sample .",
    "typical field population ages for the young disc of @xmath123 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) imply slower rotation rates by factors of @xmath122 a few than cluster members , and reduced activity , implying smaller asymmetric components of the spot coverage and hence lower photometric amplitudes ( which probably render many of them undetectable ) .",
    "the properties of all our rotation candidates are listed in table [ cand_table ] .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]      the population of objects rejected by the period detection procedure described in ",
    "[ period_section ] was examined , finding that the most variable population of these light curves ( which might correspond to non - periodic or semi - periodic variability ) was contaminated by a small number of light curves ( @xmath124 ) exhibiting various uncorrected systematic effects , mostly seeing - correlated variations due to image blending .",
    "it is therefore difficult to quantify the level of non - periodic or semi - periodic variability in ngc 2547 from our data .",
    "qualitatively however , there appear to be very few of these variables , and examining the light curves indicated only @xmath125 obvious cases , some of which resembled eclipses ( presumably due to eclipsing binaries ) , and will be the subject of a later monitor project paper .",
    "plots of period as a function of @xmath4 colour and mass for the objects photometrically selected as possible cluster members are shown in figure [ pcd ] .",
    "these diagrams show a striking correlation between stellar mass ( or spectral type ) and the longest rotation period seen at that mass , with a clear lack of slow rotators at very low masses .",
    "this trend is also followed by the majority of the rotators , with only a tail of faster rotators to @xmath126 periods .",
    "furthermore , very few objects were found rotating faster than this , implying a hard lower limit to the observed rotation periods at @xmath127 .",

    "the simulations of  [ sim_section ] suggest that this is unlikely , since we are sensitive to shorter periods than the @xmath128 ` limit ' , and the slight bias toward detection of shorter periods at low mass is not sufficient to explain the observations for the slow rotators .",

    "a very large fraction ( @xmath133 ) of the bright rotators ( @xmath134 ) were detected in the x - ray survey of @xcite .",
    "detection in x - rays is suggestive of youth and hence cluster membership , which confirms that the level of field contamination is low in the rotation sample , especially when the incomplete spatial overlap between our optical survey and the xmm - newton observation of @xcite is accounted for .",
    "very few of the lower - mass stars in figure [ pcd ] were detected in x - rays ( e.g. for @xmath135 there was only a single x - ray detection ) , but this is not surprising since these objects are fainter .",
    "indeed , figure 3 of @xcite indicates that the x - ray detection limit for a cluster member corresponds to @xmath136 , equivalent to @xmath137 with the models we are using .      in order to quantify the morphology of figure [ pcd ] , we have used histograms of the rotation period distributions in two broad mass bins , @xmath138 and @xmath129 , shown in figure [ perioddist ] .",
    "we have attempted to correct the distributions for the effects of incompleteness and ( un)reliability using the simulations described in  [ sim_section ] , following the method used in @xcite .",
    "the results of doing this are shown in the solid histograms in figure [ perioddist ] , and the raw period distributions in the dashed histograms .",
    "the period distributions in the two mass bins of figure [ perioddist ] show clear differences , with the low - mass stars ( @xmath130 ) showing a strongly peaked rotational period distribution , with a maximum at @xmath139 , whereas the higher - mass stars ( @xmath138 ) show a broader distribution .",
    "we applied a two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov test to the corrected distributions to confirm the statistical significance of this result , finding a probability of @xmath140 that the distributions were drawn from the same parent population .",
    "the implication of this result is that the observed morphology in figure [ pcd ] , and in particular the increase of the longest observed rotation period as a function of increasing mass , a trend followed also by the bulk of the rotators , is real and statistically significant .",
    "we have examined the periods of our fastest - rotating stars , to check if they are rotating close to their break - up velocity .",

    "however , the majority of our objects are rotating at much lower fractions of their break - up velocity .",
    "figure [ pad ] indicates that there is only one object with @xmath145 , n2547 - 2 - 2 - 1485 at @xmath146 .",
    "therefore , in common with the other clusters we have studied , we find a short - period limit of @xmath147 , with no objects found rotating faster than this rate .      observations of open clusters in the age range @xmath67 to several gyr have established an age - rotation - activity relationship , where younger stars tend to be more rapidly rotating , and emit strong x - rays ( up to a saturation level ) , whereas older stars have spun - down to lower rotation rates , and emit a smaller fraction of their flux in x - rays ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "such high x - ray luminosities would be indicative of very strong activity , or alternatively , overestimation of @xmath163 or underestimation of @xmath164 .",
    "these objects could also result from mis - identification of a very luminous background agn in x - rays with a cluster star in the optical , given the large search radii ( here @xmath165 ) which must be used due to the limited astrometric accuracy of the x - ray data .    in order to attempt to trace the rotation - activity relation to lower - mass in ngc 2547 , it would be desirable to obtain deeper x - ray observations , since the stars with masses @xmath166 were not detected in the existing xmm - newton observations of @xcite .",
    "we have compared the rotation period results to the mid - ir observations of @xcite , to search for any correlation between mid - ir excess ( presumably due to a circumstellar disc ) and rotation period , as would be expected in the disc regulation paradigm for angular momentum evolution on the early - pms .",

    "this object does not have an @xmath174 excess , indicating that the inner disc has cleared , which may also be consistent with the disc regulation paradigm , since the inner disc is most likely the part that couples to the star to induce angular momentum loss and prevent it from spinning up .",

    "the lack of any change in the median relation for stars still undergoing contraction on the pms indicates that any mass - dependent angular momentum losses are not important in determining the evolution of the median over this age range , unless high angular momentum is hidden in a fast rotating radiative core .",
    "however , this is not the case in detail or once the stars reach the zams , in particular it is clear ( e.g. from figure [ pmd ] ) the _ shape _ of the distribution does evolve in a mass - dependent fashion ( see also the next section ) .        for a full description of our simple model scheme ,",
    "the reader is referred to the ngc 2516 publication @xcite .",
    "briefly , we have generated models for solid body rotation , and a simple implementation of core - envelope decoupling where the core and envelope are treated as two separate entities joined at the convective / radiative boundary by angular momentum transfer according to the prescription of @xcite .",
    "the angular momentum loss rate was split into two components : losses due to stellar winds , assuming a loss law with saturation at a critical angular velocity @xmath199 ( allowed to vary as a function of mass ) , and losses due to disc locking , which to a good approximation maintains a constant angular velocity until the circumstellar disc dissipates at an age @xmath200 . for the decoupled models",
    "there is one further parameter , @xmath201 , the timescale for coupling of angular momentum between the core and envelope .    for ngc 2547 ,",
    "we have computed the object masses using two different values of the cluster parameters ( particularly , the age ) , in order to examine the consistency of the rotation periods with the range of cluster ages found in the literature .",
    "the first set of parameters are those assumed earlier , corresponding to an age of @xmath202 , which is consistent with the lithium age for the cluster of @xmath203 @xcite .",

    "we first attempt to evolve the observed rotation rates from our survey in ngc 2362 ( irwin et al .",
    ", in preparation ) forward in time to reproduce the available rotation period data .",
    "following the method used in section 6.2.2 of @xcite , we have characterised the slow rotator population by the @xmath206th percentile ( the lower quartile ) of the distribution of observed angular velocities , @xmath96 , and the fastest rotators by the @xmath207th percentile .",
    "figure [ pevol ] shows a revised version of figure 19 of @xcite , adding in the ngc 2547 data .",
    "we have re - used the solid body and differentially rotating model fits to the ngc 2516 data : the models were _ not _ re - fit with the ngc 2547 observations .",
    "the mass bins used were as before : @xmath208 , @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 , and @xmath212 ( chosen empirically to encompass the changes in behaviour seen in the models , while retaining reasonable statistics ) . the models were calculated for single masses roughly at the centre of these bins , of @xmath107 , @xmath213 , @xmath214 , @xmath215 and @xmath216 .",
    "since there are very few observations ( one ) in the highest - mass bin for ngc 2547 , this will not be discussed further here .",
    "model parameters are summarised in each panel of figure [ pevol ] .",
    "briefly , we fit the models using ngc 2362 as an initial condition , to best - reproduce the ngc 2516 rotation periods .",
    "the saturation angular velocity @xmath199 and disc lifetime @xmath200 were varied to obtain the best - fit for the solid body models to the fast rotators , and for the decoupled models we varied @xmath201 , the core - envelope coupling timescale , to fit the slow rotators .",
    "see @xcite for a more detailed discussion .",
    "the models for the @xmath217 bin show overall good agreement with the ngc 2547 data . at this mass and age",
    "it is difficult to distinguish between the solid body and decoupled models , but at later ages , the solid body model appears to give a better fit to the rapid rotators , and a differentially - rotating model to the slow rotators @xcite .",
    "however , in the remaining three bins ( and to some extent in the @xmath218 bin ) , a clear trend is visible for both the fast and slow rotator populations , where the observations show that the stars in ngc 2547 are rotating slower than expected .",
    "returning to figure [ pmd ] , it is clear that the fastest rotators have spun up significantly from ngc 2362 to ngc 2547 , in accordance with the model prediction .",
    "furthermore , there is some degree of scatter in the ngc 2362 data , especially at short periods , which may be due to contamination , e.g. from field binaries ( irwin et al .",
    ", in preparation ) in a similar fashion as we have hypothesised in m34 @xcite and ngc 2516 @xcite .",
    "if this is true , the presence of these objects has shifted the @xmath207th percentile in ngc 2362 upward in @xmath96 , and may partly explain the discrepancy , especially due to the small number of objects in question .",
    "it is difficult to confirm this hypothesis before obtaining follow - up spectroscopy for the ngc 2362 sample to determine the nature of these objects .    for the slow rotators , examining figure [ pmd ]",
    "indicates that there are a number of ` outliers ' at longer period than the general trend shown by the upper envelope of the rotators .",
    "it is possible that that if these objects were removed from the computation of the percentiles , the slow rotators would then fall into agreement with the models .",
    "the nature of these objects is not clear , and we defer discussion of them in detail until we can obtain spectroscopy to confirm their nature as slow rotators , and confirm the masses we have determined from the models of @xcite .",
    "returning to the issue of the age of ngc 2547 , the rotation periods seem to be slightly more consistent with the younger @xmath204 age , although the results are still clearly not reproduced by the models , especially in the intermediate - mass @xmath210 and @xmath211 bins , where the ngc 2547 objects appear to be rotating slower than the models predict . moving the ngc 2547 points to the left in the diagram",
    "would improve agreement with the models , but this is difficult to justify since the youngest ages in the literature for this cluster are @xmath219 . given the uncertainties in the models , the rotation period measurements can not therefore place useful constraints on the cluster age .    in light of the discussion above , the ngc",
    "2547 data seem to be in reasonable agreement with the models , pending the results of spectroscopic follow - up , without need for significant modification from the earlier ngc 2516 study @xcite . at this age",
    "it is difficult to observe the effects of core - envelope decoupling , so we are unable to refute our earlier statements that core - envelope decoupled models appear to be required to reproduce the evolution of the slowest rotators , and that the same models do not appear to give a good fit to the fast rotators , which are well - fit by solid body models .",
    "figure [ jmd_n2362_evol ] shows the results of attempting to evolve the measured rotation periods in ngc 2362 forward in time to the age of ngc 2547 using the models we have described , with the relations fit from the ngc 2516 data for @xmath199 as a function of mass , on an object - by - object basis . by doing this , we can test if the model we have presented can reproduce the observations of ngc 2547 , given the ngc 2362 rotators as an input .         comparing",
    "the left and right - hand panels in figure [ jmd_n2362_evol ] indicates that the results are relatively independent of the assumed age for ngc 2547 .",
    "this is due to the relatively shallow slope of the time - dependence in the rotation rates during this age range ( see figure [ pevol ] ) .",
    "the shape of the mass dependent morphology of the ngc 2547 distribution is reasonably well - reproduced from the ngc 2362 distribution by the models , with the differentially rotating models providing a slightly better fit overall to the slow rotators , but at this age it is difficult to distinguish between the two classes of models since the effects of differential rotation become much more pronounced between @xmath220 .",
    "furthermore , the rotation rates are also well - reproduced below @xmath221 , but not for higher masses , where the predicted rates are @xmath122 a factor of two faster than actually observed in ngc 2547 .",
    "it should be noted that the adopted values of @xmath199 in this mass range are not well - constrained by the ngc 2516 data used to calibrate them , and have a strong effect on the morphology of this part of the diagram , so it is possible that any deviations here result from our assumption of a linear relation over the entire mass range .",
    "the models predict that a number of objects should be rotating faster than @xmath222 , whereas none were observed in ngc 2547 .",
    "however , re - examining figure [ pmd ] shows some scatter in the ngc 2362 distribution at short periods , which may be related to contamination of the sample , so it is difficult to conclude if this result is significant before obtaining follow - up of the ngc 2362 sample .",
    "this work suggests overall that the mass dependence of the observed rotation period distribution is reasonably well - reproduced by the combination of the initial conditions as seen in ngc 2362 , the mass - dependence of stellar contraction on the pms , and the mass - dependence of the saturation angular velocity @xmath199 , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "we have reported on results of an @xmath0-band photometric survey of ngc 2547 , covering @xmath223 of the cluster .",
    "selection of candidate members in a @xmath3 versus @xmath4 colour - magnitude diagram using an empirical fit to the cluster sequence found @xmath7 candidate members , over a @xmath3 magnitude range of @xmath5 ( covering masses from @xmath6 down to below the brown dwarf limit ) .",
    "the likely field contamination level was estimated using a simulated catalogue of field objects from the besanon galactic models @xcite , finding that @xmath224 objects were likely field contaminants , an overall contamination level of @xmath90 , implying that there are @xmath8 real cluster members over this mass range in our field - of - view .",
    "from @xmath35 of time - series photometry we derived light curves for @xmath53 objects in the ngc 2547 field , achieving a precision of @xmath51 per data point over @xmath2 .",
    "the light curves of our candidate cluster members were searched for periodic variability corresponding to stellar rotation , giving @xmath9 detections over the mass range @xmath225 .    the rotation period distribution a a function of mass was found to show a clear mass - dependent morphology , intermediate between those found in ngc 2362 ( irwin et al .",

    "simple models of the rotational evolution were considered , both for the solid body case , and including differential rotation between a decoupled radiative core and convective envelope , as in our earlier work on ngc 2516 @xcite . allowing for the uncertainty in the age of ngc 2547 ,",
    "the results indicate that it is possible to qualitatively reproduce the shape of the observed rotation rate distribution by evolving the ngc 2362 distribution forward in time , using the parameters fit to the ngc 2516 data of @xcite .",

    "<S> we report on the results of an @xmath0-band time - series photometric survey of ngc 2547 using the mpg / eso 2.2 m telescope with wfi , achieving better than @xmath1 photometric precision per data point over @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> candidate cluster members were selected from a @xmath3 vs @xmath4 colour magnitude diagram over @xmath5 ( covering masses from @xmath6 down to below the brown dwarf limit ) , finding @xmath7 candidates , of which we expect @xmath8 to be real cluster members , taking into account contamination from the field ( which is most severe at the extremes of our mass range ) . </S>",
    "<S> searching for periodic variations in these gave @xmath9 detections over the mass range @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the rotation period distributions were found to show a clear mass - dependent morphology , qualitatively intermediate between the distributions obtained from similar surveys in ngc 2362 and ngc 2516 , as would be expected from the age of this cluster . </S>",
    "<S> models of the rotational evolution were investigated , finding that the evolution from ngc 2362 to ngc 2547 was qualitatively reproduced ( given the uncertainty in the age of ngc 2547 ) by solid body and core - envelope decoupled models from our earlier ngc 2516 study without need for significant modification .    </S>",
