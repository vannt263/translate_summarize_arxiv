    "the local atomic order in disordered condensed materials is well defined and governs many physical properties @xcite . quite often , for a disordered marerial , it is possible to find a corresponding crystal with similar local and even intermediate - range order which give rise to similarities in many structural and dynamical features of these two solids .",
    "such a crystal can be regarded as a reference crystalline structure ( crystalline counterpart ) for the corresponding disordered substance . in some cases",
    ", the reference structure can be uniquely defined .",
    "the simplest examples are toy structural models with force - constant and/or mass disorder . in these toy models ,",
    "the atoms occupy their equilibrium positions at the sites of a crystalline lattice ( e.g. simple cubic ) , which can be considered to be a reference one ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "another related example is a binary substitutional alloy , the reference system for which is a periodic point lattice with one of the two atomic species placed at the lattice sites @xcite .",
    "the disorder in such models does not influence the equilibrium positions of the atoms arranged in an ideal crystalline lattice .",
    "this makes possible the use of approximate analytical approaches ( e.g. the coherent potential approximation @xcite ) to treat the vibrational properties of the models , provided that the vibrational properties of the counterpart crystal are known .    in amorphous solids , or glasses",
    ", the atoms do not occupy the sites of a crystalline lattice , which results in positional disorder .",
    "for these materials , a choice of a reference structure becomes problematic .",
    "good counterparts can usually be found among the crystalline polymorphs having the same ( or similar ) chemical composition as the corresponding glass .",
    "for example , @xmath1-cristobalite appears to be a good crystalline counterpart for vitreous silica @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to investigate numerically the vibrational properties of a one - component @xmath0-phase @xcite crystal which is conjectured to be a good crystalline counterpart for a one - component glass with icosahedral local order ( ic glass ) @xcite .    the motivation for this choice of a crystalline counterpart of the ic glass is the following .",
    "the computational model of the ic glass is based on a simple empirical pair interatomic potential @xcite resembling the effective interionic potentials conjectured for simple metallic glass - forming alloys @xcite .",
    "the use of the same potential allows us to construct models of bcc and @xmath0-phase crystals that are stable for a wide range of thermodynamical parameters @xcite .",
    "of these two crystalline structures , the @xmath0 phase is expected to be a good reference structure for the ic glass because of the following reasons : the supercooled ic liquid ( where the interactions between atoms are described by the same potential @xcite ) undergoes a transition either to the ic glass or to a dodecagonal quasicrystal @xcite depending on the quench rate @xcite .",
    "this quasicrystal has similar local structural properties with the ic glass @xcite .",
    "however , the absence of global periodic order in the quasicrystalline phase makes the analysis of its vibrational properties a task of comparable complexity to that for the glass itself .",
    "the @xmath0 phase is one of the closest low - order crystalline approximants @xcite for this dodecagonal quasicrystal @xcite , which means that these two ( crystalline and quasicrystalline ) structures are built up from the same structural units .",
    "this implies that the ic glass and the @xmath0 phase , being both tetrahedrally closed - packed structures @xcite , are nearly isomorphous in terms of local order .",
    "knowledge of the vibrational properties of the @xmath0-phase crystal allows for a direct comparison with those of the ic glass .",
    "the apparent similarity in the vibrational densities of states of these two structures gives stronger support for the choice of this crystalline counterpart for the ic glass .",
    "the @xmath0-phase structure , used in our computations , has been obtained by means of molecular dynamics simulation with the use of an interatomic pair potential @xcite .",
    "the vibrational properties have been investigated by using both a the normal - mode analysis and by computing the spectra of appropriate time - correlation functions .",

    "for instance , the similarity between the phonon - dispersion relations of the mg@xmath24zn@xmath25 glass @xcite and those of the laves phase mgzn@xmath26 @xcite was emphasized by hafner @xcite .",
    "another interesting aspect of the dynamics of frank - kasper phases is related to the appearance of soft vibrational modes in these materials .",
    "such a soft low - frequency optic mode at the @xmath27-point ( the origin of the reciprocal lattice ) has been found numerically in the same laves phase mgzn@xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the frequency of this mode decreases with increasing pressure ( accompanied by volume compression ) and eventually becomes negative , indicating a structural phase transition @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite applied a group - theoretical analysis and demonstrated that the polarization vector of the soft optic mode in mgzn@xmath26 is determined by the structure symmetry and is independent of interatomic interactions .",
    "this suggests that the soft - mode character of some vibrations is a generic property of frank - kasper phases .",
    "however , no soft - mode behavior was observed in the isostructural camg@xmath26 @xcite where the mass ratio of the constituent elements is reversed with respect to mgzn@xmath26 .",
    "hafner @xcite suggested that the soft modes in mgzn@xmath26 should be attributed to the relatively large mass of the zn atoms .",

    "therefore , we can conclude the the lattice dynamics in the @xmath0 phase is harmonic in a wide range of temperatures @xmath123 .    finally , we would like to note the similarity between the high - temperature vdos for the @xmath0 phase and the low - temperature vdos for the ic glass ( see fig .",
    "[ vdosglass ] ) .",
    "since @xmath65 for the glass is only slightly temperature dependent , we show it only for @xmath112 .",
    "the fact that the densities of states for the glass and the high - temperature @xmath0 phase in fig .",
    "[ vdosglass ] are remarkably similar clearly indicates that the effect of the thermally - induced dynamical disorder in the crystalline structure on the vibrational spectrum is similar to that of the configurational disorder characteristic of the amorphous structure .",
    "in this paper we have studied the structural and vibrational properties of a @xmath0-phase crystal .",
    "first , we have shown that it is possible to construct a structural model of a one - component @xmath0 phase by means of molecular dynamics simulations using an appropriate pair potential .",
    "this @xmath0-phase structure is stable in a wide range of thermodynamical parameters .",
    "our model of the @xmath0 phase contains only one atomic component .",
    "this is important in understanding the role of topological icosahedral order alone on the structural and dynamical properties and avoids the effects arising from the presence of different atomic species .",
    "second , we have investigated atomic vibrational dynamics of the @xmath0 phase .",
    "in particular , we have found the range of applicability of the harmonic approximation in a description of atomic dynamics .",
    "we have also demonstrated the existence of soft modes in the @xmath0 phase which leads to a structural phase transformation with increasing pressure .",
    "third , we have demonstrated that the @xmath0 phase is a good crystalline counterpart of the ic glass .",
    "this has been done on the basis of a comparative analysis of the vibrational dynamics ( vibrational density of states ) .",
    "we think that the results on the vibrational properties of the @xmath0 phase discussed above can be used in an analysis of the peculiar vibrational properties of the ic glass ( e.g. the boson peak @xcite ) .",
    "we also believe that the computational data of the vibrational properties of the @xmath0 phase could be of value for metallurgy where this phase has received much detailed attention , chiefly because of the detrimental effect which the formation of this phase has on mechanical properties of certain steels @xcite .",
