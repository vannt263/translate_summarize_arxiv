    "photoinduced absorption or reflection spectroscopy using femtosecond lasers is potentially a very powerful tool for the study of the electronic structure of superconductors and related materials .",
    "recent pump - probe experiments on cuprate superconductors @xcite and some other materials @xcite have shown that a photoinduced change in absorption or reflection can be observed at low temperatures and especially for @xmath5 .",
    "the effects are believed to be caused by excited state absorption of the probe pulse from photoexcited quasiparticle ( qp ) states @xcite and theoretical analysis of the response was found to be in good agreement with experimental data on yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath6 over a wide range of doping @xcite . however",
    ", in addition to the qp response which occurs on the picosecond and subpicosecond timescale , a distinct slower response was also consistently observed in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( ybco ) @xcite , bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath7 ( bisco ) and bi@xmath0y@xmath8ca@xmath9srcu@xmath0o@xmath7 @xcite and more recently in the charge - density - wave ( cdw ) quasi one - dimensional peierls insulator k@xmath3moo@xmath1@xcite .",
    "it was thought to be of non - thermal origin ( detailed analysis is given in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and occurs on a timescale of 10@xmath10 s or longer ( see fig . 1 for details ) .",
    "its anomalous @xmath11-dependence @xcite - which is qualitatively different from the @xmath12-dependence of the fast qp recombination dynamics - lead the authors to the suggestion that the signal is due to localized states near the fermi energy .",
    "however , the processes involved were so far not discussed in any detail .    in this paper",
    "we examine quantitatively the photoinduced absorption ( or reflection ) from localized intra - gap states .",
    "we develop a theoretical model for two different cases : ( i ) the case of a material with a bcs - like collective gap and ( ii ) the case of a @xmath12-independent gap ( sometimes called a pseudogap ) which exists above @xmath13 .",
    "we compare the model predictions with  the available data on the temperature - dependence of the photoinduced relaxation on the nanosecond timescale in two different materials , both of which are generally thought to have a low - temperature gap : yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath14 ( @xmath13 = 90k ) and k@xmath3moo@xmath1 ( @xmath15k ) .",
    "as the name implies , pump - probe spectroscopy involves the excitation of the material by an ultrashort pump laser pulse and the subsequent measurement of the resulting _ change _ in optical absorption , transmission or reflection of the sample caused by photoexcited charge carriers . as photons from the pump laser pulse",
    "are absorbed , they excite electrons and holes in the material ( see schematic diagram in fig.2 a ) ) .",
    "these particles release their extra kinetic energy by scattering amongst themselves and with phonons ( step 2 in fig .",
    "this energy relaxation process is very rapid and the particles end up in qp states near the fermi energy ( @xmath16 ) within @xmath1710@xmath18100 fs @xcite .",
    "subsequent relaxation is slowed down by the presence of the gap and a relaxation bottleneck is formed . from pump - probe photoinduced transmission experiments in ybco @xcite and bisco @xcite , the relaxation times of the photoexcited qps were found to be in the range @xmath190.3@xmath183 ps .",
    "in addition to the picosecond transient , the signal on nanosecond timescale has been consistently observed in htsc @xcite and recently also in quasi 1d cdw insulator k@xmath3moo@xmath1 @xcite . in fig .",
    "1 the photoinduced transient taken on ybco at t=80 k is shown ( squares ) .",
    "after photoexcitation ( @xmath20 ) the signal relaxes within 10 ps to some non - zero value , that can be represented by the constant on the 100 ps timescale @xcite .",
    "the lifetime of the slow component , @xmath21 can not be directly measured , since it appears to be longer than the inter - pulse separation of @xmath22 ns .",
    "this results in the signal pile - up due to accumulation of the response from many pulses . the magnitude of this pile - up , @xmath23 , given by the difference in the signal amplitude when the pump pulse is unblocked ( 2 ) , and zero signal , when the pump is blocked ( 1 ) at negative time delays ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , is several times larger than single pulse contribution , @xmath24 given be the difference between ( 4 ) and ( 2 ) .    assuming - for simplicity - that relaxation of the signal is exponential , we can write an equation for the steady state amplitude @xmath23 : @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the amplitude of the signal from a single pulse and @xmath27 is the relaxation time .",
    "usually , @xmath28 and we can expand the exponent in the denominator of eq.(1 ) , to obtain @xmath29 . from the experiments",
    "@xcite it appears that @xmath30 s. this is long in comparison with the phonon relaxation time and with the phonon escape time from the excitation volume into the bulk or thin film substrate , which is typically 10@xmath31s , so we can ignore phonon escape effects and discuss only intrinsic relaxation processes .",
    "the process giving rise to the actual  photoinduced optical signal from intra - gap states is shown as step 3 in fig.2a ) .",
    "here we do not discuss the optical probe process in detail , but make the very general assumption that the photoinduced _ change _ in sample transmission @xmath32 or reflection @xmath33 is proportional to the photoinduced density of localized states populated by the laser pump pulse . the photoinduced signal @xmath32 ( or @xmath34  is then proportional to the number of filled localized states and the @xmath12-dependence is mainly determined by the occupation of the intra - gap states .    since the relaxation time @xmath35 is long in comparison with @xmath36 and phonon relaxation times ,",
    "we assume that phonons and quasiparticles can be described by equilibrium densities @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively . for the relaxation of the localized carriers we apply arguments similar to those originally proposed by rothwarf and taylor @xcite .",
    "the rate equation for the total density of localized excitations @xmath39 is then given by : @xmath40 the first term in eq.(2 ) describes the recombination of two localized excitations to a cooper pair with a recombination rate @xmath41 .",
    "the second and the third terms describe the exchange of an electron or a hole between the localized and quasiparticle states with density @xmath39 and @xmath38 respectively and with a rates @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the energy barrier between trapped carriers and quasiparticles @xcite . the last term describes the spontaneous creation of localized excitations by phonons with a relaxation rate @xmath44 .",

    ", we can rewrite eq.(2 ) :    @xmath48    this equation is sufficiently general that it can be applied to different superconductors and different gaps .",
    "( for the case of a cdw gap , the cooper pairs are replaced by @xmath49 pairs . ) in this paper we consider a ) a superconductor with a bcs - like gap ( which can also be used in the case of a gap formed by a cdw ) and b ) a bose condensate of pre - formed pairs with a @xmath12-independent gap . in the latter case , the gap is better considered as an energy - level splitting between paired and unpaired states , and the main difference is that the gap is @xmath12-independent and exists above @xmath13 . a general exact solution to eq.(3 )",
    "is given in the appendix .",
    "next we consider the limiting behavior at low @xmath12 and near @xmath13 .    in the case of a collective bcs - like gap , @xmath50",
    ", the recombination rate below @xmath13 is to the lowest order in @xmath51 proportional to the square of the order parameter @xcite : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a constant , and @xmath54 is the phonon spectrum cutoff frequency .",
    "( above @xmath13 all recombination processes disappear as @xmath55 to relax the carriers in localized intra - gap states via quasiparticle states ( the term @xmath56 in eq.(3 ) ) , an energy of the order of @xmath51 is required and so this process is exponentially suppressed at low temperatures .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath57 is also small at low temperatures , because the number of thermally excited localized excitations is small as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 depends on the density of localized states .",
    "therefore , for analysis of the relaxation of localized excitations at low temperatures @xmath60 , we retain only the first term in eq.(3 ) giving a solution of the form :    @xmath61    to obtain the stationary solution for a repetitive laser pump pulse train excitation , we use the condition that the total number of localized excitations that recombine between two laser pulses should equal the number of localized excitations created by each laser pulse :    @xmath62    where @xmath63 @xmath64 is the probability of trapping a qp into a localized state and @xmath65 is the number of photoinduced qps at temperature @xmath12 created by each laser pulse . since the number of photoexcited carriers is typically small compared to the overall carrier density @xmath66",
    ", we can estimate @xmath67 as    @xmath68    as a result , combining ( 4 ) and ( 7 ) we get an expression for the @xmath12-dependence of the photoinduced transmission ( or reflection ) amplitude _ at low temperatures _ :    @xmath69    where @xmath70 for a bcs - like case is given by @xcite :    @xmath71    here @xmath72 is the energy density deposited per pulse , @xmath73 is the effective number of phonons per unit cell involved in the relaxation process and @xmath74 is the density of states at the fermi energy in units ev@xmath75cell@xmath75spin@xmath75 .    near @xmath76 when the number of thermally excited localized carriers becomes comparable or larger than number of nonequilibrium carriers , the relaxation terms @xmath77 and @xmath78 become dominant , and the solution to eq .",
    "( 3 ) has an exponential rather than a power law time dependence of the form @xmath79 where @xmath80 for @xmath81 the temperature dependence of the photoinduced signal amplitude is then given by :    @xmath82    thus the predicted amplitude of the signal increases with increasing @xmath12 up to @xmath13 and drops to zero above @xmath83    in the case of a @xmath12-independent gap ( or  pseudogap  ) , @xmath84 , we assume that the gap exists at all temperatures .",
    "since the gap does not close at @xmath13 , the recombination rate does not go to zero at @xmath13 and instead of ( 4 ) we have a constant , @xmath85 .",
    "however , below @xmath13 the presence of the condensate may also have an effect on the recombination of localized excitations .",
    "in general , the relaxation rate is a function of the order parameter . to take this into account",
    ", we can expand it in terms of even powers of @xmath86 .",
    "near @xmath13 the order parameter is small and we can keep only the lowest power in @xmath87 @xcite . if we assume that the order parameter exhibits mean - field behavior @xmath88 then :    @xmath89    where @xmath53 is phenomenological constant which describes the dependence of the relaxation rate on @xmath12 below @xmath13 , which in general is not equal to 0 .    a slightly different expression for @xmath41 is obtained if we assume that the recombination rate is dependent on the pair momentum in the condensate through the kinetic energy . to illustrate this , we write the recombination rate as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the momentum averaged recombination rate , and @xmath92 is the recombination rate for pairs with @xmath93 .",
    "the recombination rate is generally proportional to the number of pairs in the condensate @xmath94 for bose condensation this is given by @xmath95 and we thus obtain a formula for the total relaxation rate which is similar to eq .",
    "( 11 ) , but with a different temperature dependence in the first term : @xmath96 in principle the two cases ( 11 ) or ( 12 ) can be distinguished by measurements of the @xmath12-dependence of the photoinduced transmission or reflection below @xmath97 although the difference will be very small and very high quality data is needed to do this .    to obtain the photoinduced signal amplitude , we substitute eq.(11 ) into eq .",

    ", a crossover to exponential time relaxation takes place when the number of thermally excited excitations become large and the second term in the eq.(3 ) becomes dominant , i.e. @xmath102 , leading to a linear intensity dependence of @xmath103 given by modified eq.(10 ) with @xmath99 and r from eq.(12 ) .",

    "is present also above @xmath13 .",
    "this effect is due to temperature dependence of @xmath99 controlled by @xmath12-independent pseudogap above @xmath13 .    in cuprate superconductors",
    "there is spectroscopic evidence suggesting that there is a significant density of states in the gap possibly extending to the fermi level , which is often attributed to a @xmath118-wave gap symmetry .",
    "however , by normal spectroscopies it is difficult to determine if the states in the gap are qp states or , for example , localized states .",
    "time - resolved spectroscopy can answer this question rather effectively because of the different time- and temperature - dependences of the qps and localized carrier relaxations .",
    "it was argued that in the presence of impurity scattering qp dos in the @xmath118-wave state remains finite at zero energy @xcite .",
    "recently it was proposed @xcite that the quasiparticles in the superconducting state may become strongly localized for short coherence length @xmath118-wave superconductors .",

    "on the basis of available experimental data we can not make any definite conclusion about _ origin _ of intragap localized states .",
    "we can , however estimate the density of the intra - gap states from the available data by assuming that the optical probe process ( step 3 )  is similar for excited state absorption from localized states and for qps .",
    "both optical probe processes involve allowed transitions to the same final state @xmath119 and so this assumption is not unreasonable . from typical photoinduced reflection data for ybco ( as in figure 1 ) , we find that approximately @xmath120 , implying that also @xmath121 from this we can conclude that the density of intra - gap states is _ comparable _ with the density of qp states .",
    "this observation has important implications for the interpretation of frequency - domain spectroscopies , since it suggests that the spectra should show a very significant intra - gap spectral density due to localized states , irrespective of the gap symmetry .    assuming that the optical transition probability of the probe pulse is the same for qps as for the intra - gap states , from eqs .",

    "however , the fact that the signals in k@xmath3moo@xmath1 and yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 are very similar appears to rule out both spin excitations and vortex states , leaving localized charges as the most plausible origin of the intra - gap states .",
    "to conclude , the calculated time- and temperature- dependence of the photoinduced absorption for the case of a bcs - like gap is found to be in good agreement with experimental data from femtosecond time - resolved spectroscopy on the cuprate superconductor yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath6 near optimum doping and the charge - density wave insulator k@xmath3moo@xmath1 .",
    "we find that time - resolved spectroscopy can very effectively distinguish between qp states and localized states in the gap .",
