    "one of the fundamental conceptual difficulties in modern physics bears the name quantum measurement problem , and comprises the result of a measurement when quantum effects are taken into account . in the first decades of the xx century",
    "the feasibility of analyzing this problem in the experimental realm was an impossible task , but the technology in the 1980s finally allowed the possibility of performing repeated measurements on single quantum systems , in which some of the most striking features of quantum measurement theory could be tested [ 1 ] .    in the context of the orthodox quantum theory a measurement",
    "is described by von neumann s reduction postulate , nevertheless , as we already know , this proposal shows conceptual difficulties [ 2 ] . in order to solve these problems some formalisms , which are equivalent to each other ,",
    "have been proposed [ 3 ] . in this direction",
    "some works , stemming from the aforementioned proposals , have been done .",
    "they render theoretical predictions that could be tested against the experiment [ 4 , 5 , 6 ] .",
    "neverwithstanding , all these theoretical predictions have been done in the realm of the so called quantum demolition ( qd ) measurements , in which an absolute limit on the measurability of the measured quantity is always present .",
    "this limit is a direct consequence of heisenberg s uncertainty principle [ 1 ] .",
    "as we already know , there are another kind of measuring processes , in which this standard quantum limit can be avoided , they are called quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurements [ 1 ] .",
    "the idea here is to measure a variable such that the unavoidable disturbance of the complementary one does not disturb the evolution of the chosen variable , this idea was pioneered by braginsky , vorontsov , and khalili [ 7 ] .",
    "the relevance of the understanding of the measurement problem has not only academic importance , it possesses also practical importance , for instance , it plays a relevant role in the comprehension of the measurement of the position of the elements of a gravitational  wave antenna [ 1 ] . another point in connection with",
    "the quantum measurement problem is its possible relation with gravity , namely it could also shed some light upon another fundamental problem in modern physics , i.e. , the question around the validity at quantum level of the equivalence principle [ 8 , 9 ] .    in this work",
    "we find a family of qnd variables for the case of a particle immersed in an inhomogeneous gravitational field .",
    "afterwards , its propagator , when these qnd variables are measured , is calculated , and the probabilities , corresponding to different measurement outputs , are deduced .",
    "finally , we compare this case with the results of a quantum demolition situation [ 6 ] , namely to the case in which the position of our quantum particle is continuously monitored .",
    "consider the lagrangian of a particle , with mass @xmath1 , moving in the earth s gravitational field , and located a distance @xmath2 from the center of it    @xmath3    the corresponding hamiltonian reads    @xmath4    at this point we introduce an approximation , namely the particle is located at a distance @xmath5 above the earth s surface , where the condition @xmath6 is fulfilled , here @xmath7 denotes the radius of the earth . the intention with this approximation is to obtain a path integral , and to be able to calculate it analytically , even if we consider the effects of a measuring process .",
    "mathematically this simplification is important , since as is already known [ 10 ] , even the path integral ( here path integral means feynman s original time  sliced formula ) of a quantum particle moving in a coulombian potential ( without the inclusion of a measuring process ) shows mathematical problems , for instance , the so called path collapse .",
    "this aforementioned simplification allows us to avoid this problem , and also to find in a , more or less , simple way the analytical expression for the corresponding propagator .",
    "therefore , in a first approach to this problem we consider the case in which the particle remains near the earth s surface .    under these conditions",
    "the hamiltonian becomes    @xmath8    where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and the constant , that appears in ( 2 ) , has been chosen equal to @xmath11 .",
    "let us now introduce the operator    @xmath12    where @xmath13 .",
    "the differential equation that determines if this last operator defines a qnd variable reads [ 11 ]    @xmath14    defining @xmath15 , we find that expression ( 5 ) becomes    @xmath16    its solution reads    @xmath17    here @xmath18 is a constant .",
    "hence    @xmath19.\\ ] ]    the solution given by expression ( 8) defines a family of functions , and each element of it is a qnd variable .",
    "indeed , any choice for our function @xmath20 renders a qnd variable , and this function is not determined by the differential equation and remains as a free parameter in our model .",
    "let us now introduce a measuring process , namely the observable related to @xmath21 will be measured continuously . in order to analyze the propagator of our system we will resort to the so called restricted path integral formalism , in which the measuring process is taken into account through a weight functional in the path integral [ 11 ] .",
    "this means that now we must consider a weight functional , which has to take into account the effect of the measuring device upon the measured system .",
    "mathematically , this weight functional restricts the integration domain , i.e. , the integration is performed only over those paths that match with the measurement output .",
    "the problem at this point is to choose a particular expression for this weight functional . here",
    "our choice is a gaussian form .",
    "a justification for this election stems from the fact that the results coming from a heaveside weight functional [ 12 ] and those coming from a gaussian one [ 13 ] coincide up to the order of magnitude . at this point",
    "it is noteworthy to add that even the possibility of having measuring processes with this kind of functionals has already been discussed [ 14 ] .",
    "this kind of weight functional has been employed to analyze the response of a gravitational wave of weber type [ 11 ] , the measuring process of a gravitational wave in a laser  interferometer [ 15 ] , or even to explain the emergence of the classical concept of time [ 16 ] .",
    "therefore , in a first approach to this topic we may consider a measuring device whose weight functional has a gaussain form .",
    "hence under these conditions the propagator becomes    @xmath22}(z '' , z ' ) = \\int_{z'}^{z''}d[l]d[p]\\exp{\\big[}{i\\over\\hbar}\\int_{\\tau ' } ^{\\tau ' ' } ( { \\vec{p}~^2\\over 2 m } - mgl - { m\\omega^2\\over 2}l^2)dt{\\big ] } \\times\\nonumber\\\\ \\exp{\\big ( }   -{1\\over t\\delta a^2}\\int _ { \\tau ' } ^{\\tau ' ' } [ a(t ) - a(t)]^2dt{\\big)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 is the experimental error associated with the measuring of @xmath24 , and @xmath25 denotes the time that the experiment lasts .",

    "we have found a family of qnd variables for the case of a particle immersed in an inhomogeneous gravitational field , and afterwards , we have calculated the corresponding propagator and probabilities , when these qnd variables are subject to a continuous quantum measurement .",
    "expression ( 14 ) gives us the probability of having as measurement output , for our observable @xmath21 , the function @xmath29 . in connection with ( 14 )",
    "there is an interesting case , namely , if @xmath34 , then we obtain that @xmath35 } = 1 $ ] , in other words , all the possible measurement outputs have the same probability .",
    "this is a peculiar situation , indeed , if we remember how the effects of the measuring device have been introduced , we may notice that we have considered a weight functional , which , as has already been mentioned , restricts the integration domain [ 11 ] , i.e. , only those paths matching with the measurement output are taken into account in the path integral .",
    "nevertheless , if the resolution of the measuring device satisfies the condition @xmath36 , then all paths have the same probability . in this sense",
    "this case is as if there were no measuring process .",
    "indeed , in the situation in which there is no measurement , all the paths have the same probability [ 18 ] .",
    "this quantum feature appears only in connection with qnd measurements , clearly , in the case of qd measurements the effects of the weight functional do not disappear in the expression for the probability [ 6 ] .",
    "as we already know , a qnd measurement could be classified as a classical measuring process , in the sense that there is no standard quantum limit [ 11 ] .",
    "but as it has already been shown , there are qnd cases in which all the possible trajectories have the same probability , a situation which does not match with a classical case , in which only one trajectory has non  vanishing probability",
    ". this feature should be no surprise , if we consider a one  dimensional harmonic oscillator ( see page 106 , equation ( 6.32 ) of [ 11 ] ) , then considering the limit of zero experimental resolution we obtain , once again , this behaviour .",
    "the contribution of the present work comprises the statement that this characteristic appears , not only if the resolution vanishes , but also when it satisfies a certain relation , the one involves the duration of the measuring process , and also the mass of the particle .",
    "looking at ( 14 ) we may notice that the mass of the test particle , @xmath1 , appears once again in the probability , i.e. , gravity is at quantum level not a purely geometric effect [ 19 ] .",
    "another point comprises the fact that this mass appears but not always in the relation @xmath37 , as happens in the collela , werner , and overhauser experiment [ 20 ] , or in the case of a qd experiment [ 6 ] .        clearly",
    ", we may notice that there is no standard quantum limit , in other words , we may measure @xmath24 with an arbitrarily small error , and in consequence all the necessary information can be extracted . another feature that we may notice from expression ( 15 ) involves the fact that this probability does not depend upon the measurement output , i.e. , upon @xmath29 .",
    "we have two experimental preparations in which all the trayectories have the same probability , i.e. , if @xmath36 , or if @xmath38 .",
    "in other words , if we know that in a certain experiment all the trayectories have the same probability , it could not be determined , without further infomation , if the experiment was carried out with a vanishing experimental error , or with @xmath39 .    we could have a very small experimental error , but the case @xmath38 is an idealization , and this limit has to be understood in the sense that if the experimental resolution is much smaller that all the relevant physical variables , then we could expect to have a probability independent of the measurement outputs . experimentally this case could be a very difficult one , consider , for example , the current experimental resolution in the case of paul or penning traps [ 21 ] , which lies very far from this idealization .    at this point",
    "it is noteworthy to comment what else can be learned from the case @xmath38 .",
    "it is readily seen from expression ( 15 ) that this expression contains information about the potential , namely , about the coupling constant ( newton s constant ) , @xmath40 , the source of the gravitational field , @xmath41 , and also about the geometry of this source , @xmath7 . in other words ,",
    "if we had , instead of a gravitational field , an electric field , then we would have an expression containing the source of the electric field , of the coupling constant between the involved charges , and also about the radius of the source of this field .",
    "an additional interesting characteristic of expression ( 15 ) comprises the fact that it does not include planck s constant , @xmath42 , but it does include the mass of the test particle , @xmath1 .",
    "here we have a radical difference with respect to the situation in which we measure a qd variable [ 6 , 19 , 20 ] . indeed , in the qd measurement case , mass and planck s constant appear always as a function of @xmath37 .    regarding this last remark",
    "we must add that in order to see nontrivial quantum mechanical effects of gravity it is not neccesary , as was believed [ 19 ] , to study effects in which @xmath42 appears explicitly . at most",
    "we could assert that this is necessary in the case of qd experiments , but not if the corresponding measurements are carried out in the realm of qnd proposals .    at this point",
    "a word must be said concerning the operational meaning of the concept of continuous quantum measurement . as we know",
    ", measurements can not be considered instantaneous ( they have a finite duration ) , and this characteristic endows the idea of continuous measurement with an important physical meaning .",
    "a more elaborated model comprises a continuous measurment as a series of instantaneous measurements with the interval between them tending to zero [ 22 ] .",
    "nevertheless , this is a controversial issue , but the work in the direction of paul and penning traps [ 21 ] could be , in a near future , a way to perform this kind of experiments [ 23 ] .    to finish ,",
    "let us comment an additional characteristic of expression ( 14 ) .",
    "we know that there are some qnd measurements in which an absolute limit may appear .",
    "for instance , if the linear momentum of a free particle is monitored , this aforementioned limit may emerge , when the instantaneous measurement of position of the test particle , before and after the monitoring of the linear momentum , is done ( see page 99 of reference [ 11 ] ) . clearly , position and linear momentum are canonical conjugate variables to each other , and that is why this absolute limit appears . at this point",
    "we may wonder why ( 14 ) has no absolute limit , in our case , position , before and after monitoring of @xmath21 , has also been instantaneously measured , i.e. , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are present from the very begining in our mathematical expressions , see ( 9 ) .",
    "the answer to this question stems from the fact that in our case the measured quantity , @xmath45 $ ] , is not the canonical conjugate variable of position , @xmath5 .",
    "we may understand better this point noting that in the present case we deal with a one  dimensional harmonic oscillator ( it has a complex frequency but this feature plays in this discussion not role at all ) subject to a measuring process . in the case of a one  dimensional harmonic oscillator ,",
    "the canonical conjugate variable of @xmath46 , is @xmath47 , and not @xmath48 [ 19 ] .",
    "if we choose @xmath49 , then we obtain a very similar situation to a one  dimensional harmonic oscillator case .",
    "of course , trigonometric functions have to be substituted with the corresponding hyperbolic ones , but this change is only a consequence of the fact that in the case of a particle moving in an inhomogeneous gravitational field ( with the approximation done after ( 2 ) ) the frequency of the emerging harmonic oscillator is complex .    these last remarks explain why expression ( 14 ) contains no absolute limit , it can emerge only if the canonical conjugate variable associated to @xmath21 were measured , before and after the monitoring of @xmath21 . to make this statement more precise ,",
    "let us choose @xmath49 , therefore an absolute limit could appear in our case if the variable @xmath50 were measured , instantaneously , before and after the monitoring of @xmath21 .",
    "at this point we must underline that the appearance of this absolute limit does not mean that @xmath21 is a qd variable [ 11 ] .",
