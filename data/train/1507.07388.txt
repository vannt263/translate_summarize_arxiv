    "the necessity of finding an ellipticity domain for the isotropic invariant @xmath35 of the logarithmic strain tensor @xmath5 ( see @xcite ) arises from the observation that the isochoric part @xmath36 of the quadratic hencky energy is not rank - one convex even in @xmath37 for @xmath1 ( see @xcite ) .",
