    "since the discovery of the formula @xmath0 by einstein , we know that the inertial mass of a particle at rest corresponds to the total amount of energy stored in the particle .",
    "it includes all forms of energy .",
    "for example , if the particle is not fundamental , being constituted by other particles , its mass is not the simple sum of the individual masses of its constituents , but the energy of interaction between them is also included in the sum , contributing to the total mass of the particle .",
    "there are , however , massive particles in nature , for example the electron , that are believed to be fundamental , i.e. , massive particles that do not have internal structure .",
    "the question that we make here is : what kind of energy is the mass of a fundamental particle ?",
    "the recent discovery of the higgs boson in lhc is not the final point in what concerns the mass origin .",
    "although the mass generation of the gauge bosons that intermediate the weak interaction is naturally described by the higgs mechanism , the fermion masses are `` put on hand '' in the lagrangian .",
    "therefore , we are not sure if the higgs mechanism is the one that give mass to the charged leptons . furthermore , even if the higgs mechanism is responsible for generating the lepton masses , there is not yet a convincing explanation to the fact that the yukawa coupling between the higgs boson and each charged lepton is so different .",
    "the charged leptons have the same quantum numbers , except by their masses which are different .",
    "this fact often leads theoretical physicists to think on the muon and on the tau as being excited states of the electron .",
    "however , there is not yet a satisfactory model to describe such excited states , and new ideas that could shed light and inspire the construction of a successful theory towards this direction are welcome .",
    "we propose in this paper a different point of view about the nature of the rest mass that could be a starting point towards the construction of a theory in which some fundamental massive particles could be thought as being excited states of other ones .",
    "we propose that the term @xmath1 is a term of kinetic energy , which is associated with a special kind of motion , done by all the massive fundamental particles , at the light speed @xmath6 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ rest ]",
    "we propose and justify the interpretation of @xmath1 as being a term of kinetic energy . in section [ outrest ]",
    "we extend this interpretation to the case where the particle is observed from other inertial frames . in section [ semi_classical ]",
    "we analyse a physical scenario in which the special microscopic motion , whose kinetic energy is @xmath1 , is a microscopic orbital circular motion ( mocm ) .",
    "finally , in section [ conc ] we make the summary and the final conclusions .",
    "the term @xmath1 has the same structure as the term of kinetic energy @xmath2 .",
    "what we mean is that these two terms have the structure `` mass times the square of the velocity '' .",
    "it means that , if @xmath2 represents the kinetic energy of a particle with mass @xmath7 and velocity @xmath8 , then the term @xmath1 can be interpreted as being not the rest energy , but the kinetic energy of a particle with mass @xmath7 and velocity @xmath6 .",
    "it is possible to argue that `` _ the light speed @xmath6 in the vacuum is a mere constant that gives the dimension of energy to the mass in the mks system _ '' .",
    "this argument , however , is not true , i.e. , the light speed @xmath6 is not a mere constant . in first place",
    ", the light speed only has the same value @xmath6 in any inertial frame because the time and the space are relative quantities , that depend on the referential .",
    "it can be considered a mere coincidence the fact that the lorentz transformations , for the time and for the space , have exactly the required shape in order that the light speed in the vacuum remains with the same value @xmath6 in any inertial frame .",
    "second , although @xmath6 has the same value in any inertial frame , we must remember that @xmath6 is a function of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively the electric and magnetic permeabilities of the vacuum , through the formula @xcite : @xmath11",
    "so the light speed @xmath6 in the vacuum has the particular value @xmath12 because the permeabilities @xmath9 and @xmath10 have the particular values that they have . however , the values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 could be different than they are , what would imply in a different value for @xmath6 . in fact , in a material medium , where the permeabilities @xmath13 and @xmath14 are different of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the electromagnetic waves propagate with velocity different of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "other possible question is : `` _ why can we compare the term @xmath1 , product of relativity theory , with the non - relativistic term @xmath2 ? _ '' .",
    "the answer for this question is that although the term @xmath1 was discovered in special relativity theory , this term is the first one to survive in the non - relativistic limit , i.e. , in the limit @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , when we make the expansion of the relativistic energy , the zero order term of the expansion is the term @xmath1 . in this expansion ,",
    "the term @xmath2 arises as a first order correction for the energy : @xmath16 in this sense , we can say that the term @xmath1 is more `` non - relativistic '' than the term @xmath2 . in short",
    ", we can say that these two terms are important in the same kinematical regime , i.e. , in the regime @xmath15 , and they can be compared between themselves .    in summary",
    ", we are proposing to interpret the term @xmath1 as being a term of kinetic energy , which is associated with a special kind of motion done by all the massive fundamental particles at the velocity of light .",
    "obviously , this special motion can not be a macroscopic motion in the 3-dimensional space , otherwise we would see the massive particles travelling through the space like the massless ones .",
    "the fact that we see the massive particles `` at rest '' indicates that this special motion happens in a microscopic scale .",
    "finally , the fact that the massive fundamental particles move at the light speed @xmath6 implies that the physical property called `` mass '' is not an intrinsic property of the particles . according to special relativity theory",
    ", only massless particles can move at the light speed @xmath6 . therefore , all the fundamental particles that exist in nature are intrinsically massless . in the present theory ,",
    "the only difference between a particle classified as `` massive '' and a particle classified as `` massless '' is the type of motion that the particle does .",
    "if the particle moves rectilinearly through the space , at the light speed @xmath6 , it is classified as `` massless '' . on the other hand ,",
    "if the particle makes the special microscopic motion proposed here , also at the light speed @xmath6 , it is classified as `` massive '' . in section [ semi_classical ]",
    "we will analyse a physical scenario in which this special motion is a microscopic orbital circular motion .",
    "the energy @xmath17 of a massless particle is related with its linear moment @xmath18 through the expression : @xmath19 since in the present theory the `` mass '' is not an intrinsic property of the particle , the relation ( [ disp_rel ] ) is valid also for `` massive '' particles .",
    "let us label the linear moment of a `` massive '' particle as @xmath5 .",
    "since the particle is doing a special microscopic motion , @xmath5 is the instantaneous linear moment associated with this motion .",
    "using relation ( [ disp_rel ] ) , the energy associated with this special motion can be rewritten as a function of @xmath20 : @xmath21 where @xmath20 is the modulus of the vector @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , looking at eq .",
    "( [ disp_rel_mass ] ) we conclude that : @xmath22      now let us understand better the differences between @xmath1 and @xmath2 when we interpret @xmath1 as being one term of kinetic energy .",
    "first , observe that , in general , when we take the kinetic energy @xmath23 , the mass ( @xmath7 ) of the particle is kept fixed , and each value @xmath17 of the energy corresponds to a different value @xmath8 of the velocity . in particular , if the system is quantized ( suppose , for example , that the particle is inside a potential well ) the discrete energies @xmath24 are related with the discrete velocities @xmath25 through the expression : @xmath26 on the other hand , the light speed @xmath6 has a fixed value .",
    "therefore , when we take the expression @xmath27 as being the kinetic energy of the particle , each different energy @xmath17 must corresponds to a different mass @xmath7 . in particular ,",
    "if the system is quantized , the discrete energies @xmath24 correspond to the discrete masses @xmath28 through the formula : @xmath29    now let us calculate the energy acquired by a particle that is under the action of a force @xmath30 . when the force is applied on the particle ,",
    "its energy @xmath17 will change an amount @xmath31 given by : @xmath32 in a mathematically more rigorous way we can do the last two passages as : @xmath33 the particle with kinetic energy @xmath23 has a moment @xmath34 .",
    "an infinitesimal change in @xmath35 is given by : @xmath36 .",
    "substituting @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ enerchang ] ) , and considering that initially the particle is at rest , we obtain that the energy @xmath17 acquired by the particle is given by : @xmath37 therefore , by substituting the infinitesimal change @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ enerchang ] ) , we were able to obtain the expression of the kinetic energy @xmath23 .",
    "now let us consider the expression @xmath27 for the kinetic energy . as discussed in the previews subsection ,",
    "the linear moment associated with this energy is : @xmath38 .",
    "but now , the modulus of the velocity @xmath39 has a fixed value @xmath6 .",
    "it means that the vector @xmath39 determines only the direction of the vector @xmath5 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath40 is determined by the `` mass '' @xmath7 , which in this case is not constant . by applying a force on the particle",
    ", we can not change the magnitude of the vector @xmath39 , but only the direction of this vector .",
    "therefore , if we apply a force @xmath30 parallel to @xmath39 , we will have @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in this case",
    ", the change in the linear moment of the particle is given by : @xmath43 .",
    "on the other hand , if the force is applied in any other direction we have : @xmath44 .",
    "but since @xmath45 constant , the variation @xmath46 can happens only perpendicularly to the velocity @xmath39 , what means that @xmath47 .",
    "substituting @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ enerchang ] ) , and considering that @xmath47 , we have : @xmath48 therefore , doing the same procedure as in the previews case , we were able to obtain the expression of the kinetic energy @xmath0 .    comparing ( [ deduzmc2 ] ) with ( [ deduzmv2s2 ] ) it becomes clear why the term @xmath1 does not have a factor @xmath49 in the denominator , like the term @xmath2 .",
    "this factor arises in the denominator when we make the integral of @xmath50 in ( [ deduzmv2s2 ] ) , whereas in ( [ deduzmc2 ] ) we have the integral of @xmath51 .",
    "the formula @xmath27 is valid only when the particle is observed in its `` rest frame '' . according to special relativity theory , when the particle is moving with uniform rectilinear velocity @xmath52 its energy is given by @xcite : @xmath53 note that the velocity @xmath52 appearing in this formula has nothing to do with the velocity of the special motion proposed in section [ rest ] . the velocity @xmath52 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ ener3 ] ) is the macroscopic velocity of the particle .",
    "observe that the special relativity theory was developed considering only the existence of the macroscopic motion , so that the velocity of the special microscopic motion is not explicit in the formulas of special relativity theory , for example it is not explicit in formula ( [ ener3 ] ) .",

    "on the other hand , the ordinary velocity is that one in which the space intervals @xmath96 and @xmath97 as well as the time interval @xmath101 are all of them measured by the observer .",
    "the proper velocity is used to define the 4-velocity in the minkowski space @xcite and is more simple to lorentz transform than the ordinary velocity , since the proper time @xmath98 is lorentz invariant and so only the space interval needs to be transformed .",

    "the formulas of the lorentz transformations are well established , and the theory proposed in this paper does not imply any change in these formulas . however , an observation is in order .",
    "the present theory introduces an additional motion for massive fundamental particles . this additional microscopic motion , whose velocity is @xmath76 , is not known by special relativity theory . all the formulas of special relativity theory",
    "were constructed considering only the existence of the macroscopic velocity @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , the correct way to do the usual lorentz transformations is inserting the macroscopic velocity @xmath52 in the formulas , and not the total velocity @xmath74 that was introduced by the present theory .",
    "for example , the dilation of a time interval is calculated through the formula @xcite : @xmath103 in this formula , we must insert the macroscopic velocity @xmath52 instead of the total velocity @xmath74 . it does not even make sense using @xmath74 in the lorentz transformations , since @xmath104 . in eq .",
    "( [ timedil ] ) , for example , if we insert @xmath105 we obtain @xmath106 .",
    "another example is the relativistic energy ( [ ener3 ] ) .",

    "let us give an example to illustrate the use of the macroscopic velocity @xmath52 to do the lorentz transformations .",
    "in the previous subsection it was obtained the formula ( [ vel3 ] ) , establishing that @xmath81 is a decreasing function of @xmath8 . instead of using the hamilton equation to derive the formula ( [ vel3 ] )",
    ", we can use the lorentz transformations to obtain it .",
    "according to special relativity theory , only the position vector parallel to the macroscopic velocity @xmath52 is lorentz contracted . the position vector perpendicular to @xmath52",
    "is not contracted . in the present theory",
    "it implies that , since the microscopic motion takes place in the plane perpendicular to @xmath52 , a space interval @xmath107 travelled by the particle along this plane is never lorentz contracted . on the other hand , the proper time interval @xmath98 of the particle , which is measured in the frame where @xmath108 , is smaller than the time interval @xmath101 measured by an observer situated in an inertial frame in which @xmath80 , where @xmath52 is the macroscopic velocity of the particle .",
    "so we have that @xmath109 , and the relation between @xmath98 and @xmath101 is given by eq .",

    "this result shows us that the decrease of @xmath81 ( when @xmath8 increases ) can be interpreted as being a consequence of the lorentz time dilation , which in turn is calculated inserting the macroscopic velocity @xmath8 in the formula ( [ timedil ] ) .",
    "the space interval @xmath92 travelled by the particle in the plane perpendicular to the macroscopic velocity @xmath52 is the same in any inertial frame .",
    "however , the time spent by the particle to travel @xmath92 is different in different inertial frames . in the `` rest frame '' ,",
    "the time @xmath112 spent by the particle to move @xmath92 is smaller than the time @xmath113 measured by observers from other inertial frames seeing the particle moving the same space interval @xmath92 .",
    "the special relativity theory establishes that the velocity @xmath8 of a free massive particle can assume any value in the interval @xmath114 , but it can never be exactly equal @xmath6 because in the limit @xmath115 the energy of the particle diverges . to verify this ,",
    "it is enough to take a look at the formula ( [ ener3 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath8 approaches @xmath6 the denominator of ( [ ener3 ] ) goes to zero , and consequently the energy @xmath17 goes to infinity .",
    "the present theory provides a geometrical interpretation for this result . as discussed previously",
    ", the special relativity theory does not know the microscopic motion proposed in this paper .",
    "so , when special relativity theory tells us that the velocity of a massive particle is always smaller than the light speed it is referring to the macroscopic velocity @xmath8 .",
    "it is the macroscopic velocity @xmath8 that is always smaller than @xmath6 . to understand this result from a geometrical point of view ,",
    "let us take a look at fig .",
    "note that , even though the vectors @xmath74 and @xmath65 point out in the same direction , these two vectors have different properties . in the case of the velocity ,",
    "the vector @xmath74 has constant modulus ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "therefore , when the macroscopic velocity @xmath8 increases , the vector @xmath74 rotates clockwise .",
    "when it happens , the microscopic velocity @xmath81 decreases the amount required to keep the modulus of @xmath74 constant . in the case of the moment , it is the microscopic moment @xmath5 that has constant modulus ( @xmath116 ) , and not the total moment @xmath65 . in this case ,",
    "a change in the macroscopic moment @xmath18 results in a change in the modulus of @xmath65 as well as in a rotation of this vector .",
    "however , in this process the microscopic moment @xmath117 remains always constant .",
    "now let us analyse why the macroscopic velocity @xmath8 can not be equal @xmath6 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the right figure alone does not tell us that @xmath8 is prohibited to be equal @xmath6 , but if we look at the left figure we see immediately the reason for this .",
    "the vector @xmath65 points out in the same direction as the vector @xmath74 , so that the angle @xmath118 appearing in the left figure is the same angle @xmath118 appearing in the right figure .",
    "the point is that the vector @xmath5 has a fixed modulus , @xmath4 , what implies that the angle @xmath118 is always different of zero .",
    "a small angle @xmath118 can be reached when the macroscopic moment @xmath18 is very larger than the microscopic moment @xmath20 , or equivalently when the total moment @xmath119 is very larger than @xmath20 . however , the greater is the total moment @xmath68 the greater is the energy of the particle @xmath120 . in the limit @xmath121 ( which corresponds to @xmath115 )",
    "the total moment @xmath68 diverges , resulting in the divergence of the energy .    therefore , from a geometrical point of view , what prohibits the macroscopic velocity @xmath8 to be equal @xmath6 is the fact that the modulus of the microscopic moment @xmath5 does not depend on @xmath8 , being a constant @xmath117 .",
    "it keeps the microscopic velocity @xmath81 always different of zero , even though @xmath81 can assume very small values when @xmath8 approaches @xmath6 . the only way of having @xmath122 without the divergence of the energy is making @xmath123 . in this case",
    "the angle @xmath118 becomes automatically zero , while the macroscopic moment @xmath18 remains finite .",
    "however , since @xmath4 , when we make @xmath124 we are `` turning off '' the mass of the particle . in this case",
    "the particle ceases to do the microscopic motion ( @xmath125 ) and makes only the macroscopic motion with velocity @xmath122 .",
    "until now we have proposed the existence of a microscopic motion without making any assumption about how is this motion .",
    "a very natural supposition is that it is a microscopic orbital circular motion ( mocm ) [ see fig . [ fig1 ] ] .    , where @xmath78 can be identified as the angular polar coordinate .",
    "]    in what follows we are going to analyse some characteristics of this hypothesis .",
    "as discussed previously , the plane containing the microscopic motion is perpendicular to the macroscopic velocity @xmath52 .",
    "consequently , if we suppose that the microscopic motion is the mocm , the composition of the microscopic with the macroscopic motion will result in a helical motion .",
    "here we make the observation that we are not saying that the particle does a helical trajectory because in quantum mechanics there is no trajectory .",
    "the correct is saying that there is a wave function describing the particle .",
    "this wave function is the composition of two waves , the plane wave associated with the macroscopic moment @xmath35 and the wave associated with the mocm .",
    "the heisenberg uncertainty principle implies that the fundamental particles , for example the electron , do not follow a classical trajectory .",
    "however , we can estimate the classical radius of the mocm and consider this radius as being a characteristic length scale of the motion .",
    "let us take the angular moment @xmath126 associated with the mocm ( see fig .",

    "( [ raio_class ] ) we obtain the following result for the classical radius @xmath132 of the mocm for the electron : @xmath133 note that if we multiply @xmath132 by @xmath134 we obtain exactly the compton wavelength of the electron .",
    "when the `` massive '' particle is in its `` rest frame '' , it makes the mocm with velocity @xmath6 .",
    "so , if we know the classical radius @xmath128 of the mocm we automatically know the frequency @xmath135 of this motion , i.e. , we know how many times per second the particle completes one revolution , through the formula : @xmath136 in the particular case of the electron , considering that the classical radius is given by eq .",
    "( [ re_el ] ) , we obtain : @xmath137 as discussed in subsection [ lorentr ] , when the macroscopic velocity @xmath8 increases the radius of the mocm remains constant , since it is not affected by the lorentz transformations .",
    "however , the microscopic velocity @xmath81 of the mocm decreases when @xmath8 increases in consequence of the time interval dilation , being given by : @xmath138 . since @xmath139 , an observer situated in an inertial frame in which the macroscopic velocity @xmath140 will see the particle doing the mocm with a smaller frequency @xmath135 .",
    "we proposed that there is a microscopic motion , done by all the massive fundamental particles , that is not explicit in the formulas of special relativity .",
    "the `` rest energy '' @xmath0 is , ironically , an energy of motion . in sections [ rest ] and [ outrest ] we tried to answer all basic questions concerning this proposition in order to give a strong physical basis to it .",
