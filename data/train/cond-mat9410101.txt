    "the fractional statistics in low - dimensional @xmath0 quantum systems had been a subject appreciated only by a few @xcite ; however , the discovery of the quantum hall effect @xcite has perhaps changed the status of the subject forever , promoting and reshaping it into one of the most profound as well as popular field in modern physics and into a necessary conceptual tool in condensed matter physics .",
    "the fractional statistics is usually discussed in the context of two - dimensional systems where the adiabatic transport of a test particle around the others can be used to determine the statistics independent of the dynamical nature of the interacting system . in one - dimension ( 1d ) , however , the dynamics and the kinematics can not be decoupled in an unambiguous way ( i.e. , an exchange necessarily involves a scattering ) , and the assignment of the statistics to 1d particles is largely a matter of taste . on the other hand , a good taste will yield fruitful concepts and tools .    in this paper",
    "i study the 1d fractional statistics using a specific model called calogero - sutherland model ( csm ) @xcite which describes a systems of non - relativistic quantum particles interacting with a pairwise potential that falls off as inverse - square of the distance between the particles .",
    "one of the most important practical features of this model is that the inverse - square potential can be regarded as a pure statistical interaction and the model maps to an ideal gas of particles obeying the fractional statistics @xcite .",
    "usually , the first step in understanding a general class of interacting fermi system known as fermi liquid is to study the ideal fermi gas which gives rise to important concepts and tools such as the fermi surface .",
    "much in the same spirit i start with the simplest 1d system ( i.e. , the csm ) obeying the fraction statistics .",
    "first , i list here some of the recent developments .",
    "a lattice cousin of the csm called haldane - shastry model ( hsm ) , which corresponds to the @xmath1 heisenberg spin chain with the inverse - square instead of the usual nearest neighbor exchange , has triggered a surge of interest in this class of models @xcite .",
    "the hsm is known to possess the quantum symmetry algebra known as yangian @xcite and can be considered as a model of ideal @xmath1 spinon gas obeying the semionic fractional statistics @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 versions of the csm @xcite and the hsm @xcite now exist and in particular the spectrum of @xmath2 hsm is known to possess the bethe ansatz string structure @xcite .",
    "the list goes on , but i concentrate on the @xmath3 csm in this paper .",
    "the csm is intimately related to the circular ensembles in random matrix theory first introduced by freeman dyson @xcite . in particular , the eigenvalue distribution functions for the orthogonal , unitary , and symplectic random matrices correspond to the ground state wavefunctions of the csm at the interaction parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "( @xmath7 case corresponds to the free fermi gas . )",
    "some static correlation functions of the csm can be calculated using the techniques developed for the random matrices @xcite .",
    "more recently , simons _ et .",
    "al . _ have been successful in mapping the csm to the matrix model and to the non - linear sigma model where the supersymmetric algebra is applicable @xcite , and therefore are able to calculate the dynamical density - density correlation functions ( dddcf ) for the csm at @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "haldane and zirnbauer using the similar method calculate the one - particle green s function at @xmath8 ( i.e. , the symplectic case ) @xcite .",
    "forrester @xcite also calculates some static correlation functions at integer interaction parameters using a generalized form of the celebrated selberg integral formula @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the eigenstates of the csm can be written in terms of jack polynomials @xcite whose known algebraic properties provide a powerful and direct method for calculating the most general correlation functions .",
    "recently , the author has been successful in calculating the exact dddcf and one - particle green s function at arbitrary rational interaction parameters @xcite .",
    "the method employed is new and is one of the main subjects in this paper .",
    "the exact calculations of the correlation functions further provide conclusive evidences of the inherent fractional exclusion and exchange statistics embodied in the csm @xcite .",
    "i also make a direct connection of this model to the edge states of the fractional quantum hall droplet by first constructing an effective low - energy one - dimensional `` anyon '' fluid model based on a general gauge invariance argument , and then showing that the dynamical correlation functions agree with those of the csm .",
    "this connection between the csm and the edge states has previously been suggested by various people @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way . in section [ sec : eigenstates ] i show how to construct general eigenstates of the csm , and in section [ sec : jack ] some properties of the jack polynomials are introduced . in section [ sec :",
    "fractional ] some key aspects of the exclusion and the exchange statistics are discussed .",
    "i show how to calculate the dddcf and the one - particle green s function in section [ sec : ddcf ] and [ sec : gf ] . in section [ sec : edge ]",
    "the `` harmonic - fluid '' description of the anyon fluid is constructed and the dynamical correlation functions calculated ; and i further show that they agree with those of the csm .",
    "this agreement provides an explicit connection between the csm and the system of coupled left- and right - edges of the fractional quantum hall effect and further shows the equivalence between the first- and the second - quantized construction of one - dimensional `` anyon '' gas at least in the long - wavelength limit . in section [ sec : finite ] the finite - size scaling as applied to the conformally invariant systems is used to obtain the complete set of correlation exponents .",
    "i also discuss some aspect of the lattice cousins of the csm in section [ sec : lattice ] .",
    "in this section i introduce the csm and show how to construct the general eigenstates of the model following sutherland @xcite .",
    "first , the hamiltonian for the csm on a ring of length @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the ground state wavefunctions of the model at integer values of @xmath13 corresponds to 1d versions of laughlin s wavefunctions @xcite and are given by @xmath14 where the current @xmath15 and @xmath16 . when @xmath17 there is another possible ground state with power @xmath18",
    "; however , only the solution with power @xmath13 will be considered for reasons of continuity with @xmath19 solutions .",
    "the excited states of this model are constructed by multiplying some symmetric polynomials to the ground state wavefunction , and this construction is analogous to that of the gapless edge excitations of the quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "a general excited state @xmath20 is labeled by the quantum numbers @xmath21 , and @xmath22 satisfies the following new eigenvalue equation @xmath23 where @xmath24 , and @xmath25 the eigenstates of the new hamiltonian @xmath26 are represented in terms of the following bosonic basis states @xmath27 where the sum extends over all permutations of the integer set @xmath28 which can be considered as a set of bosonic quantum numbers with no restrictions on their values . since @xmath29 does not depend on the ordering of the quantum numbers , let @xmath30 without loss of generality .",
    "these symmetric polynomials form a complete basis .",
    "the action of @xmath26 on @xmath29 can be easily calculated and are given by @xmath31 @xmath32 generates only the basis state @xmath29 itself while @xmath33 is responsible for generating a family of states @xmath34 which are obtained from @xmath29 by all possible pairwise `` squeezing '' of the quantum numbers . if a state is generated from another by squeezing a pair of quantum numbers by one unit ( i.e. , @xmath35 , @xmath36 for @xmath37 ) , then i call the former `` daughter - state '' and the latter its `` mother - state . ''",
    "the family of states can be organized into _ levels _ such that the members of a given level are mutually not related or _ unreachable _ (",
    "i.e. , no mother - daughter relationship exists between the members in the same level ) and the daughters of a member from a given level always belong to a _",
    "lower _ level in the family . the highest - level mother - state denoted by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a level index and is equal to the total number of levels in the family , generates the entire family of daughter - states which are denoted by @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 an index for the states in the @xmath43th level",
    "while the order of the levels in the family can be uniquely determined , the order within a level is quite arbitrary .    to provide an illustration of the above mentioned family structure , i give the following example .",
    "let the highest - level mother - state be @xmath44 .",
    "then , the members of the family are @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 . a pictorial representation of the family structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ tree ] and i call it a level diagram . in fig .",
    "[ tree ] the states are represented by dots and each arrow connects a state @xmath51 to @xmath52 where @xmath52 is _ reachable _ from @xmath51 by _ squeezing _ on a pair of quantum numbers for @xmath51 by one unit (",
    "i.e. , connects a mother and her daughter ) .",
    "the levels are ordered from top to bottom , from the most squeezable to unsqueezable states , such that the highest - level mother - state is at the top ; and therefore the arrows always point downwards and never upwards .",
    "a set of arrows that is topologically equivalent to a directed line forms a _",
    "path_. a _ weight _ @xmath53 of an arrow is defined to be @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the two quantum numbers squeezed to produce a daughter and @xmath57 the multiplicity of @xmath58 in the quantum number set specifying the mother - state . in fig .",
    "[ tree ] the numbers next to the arrows are the corresponding weights . the states in the same level are not connected ; hence , the hamiltonian is diagonal in that subspace .    a _ subfamily _ of a family can also be constructed by starting from a given state , which would be the highest - level mother - state of that subfamily , and grouping all her _ reachable _ off - springs .",
    "the total number of _ subfamilies _ is therefore equal to the _ dimension _",
    "( i.e. , the total number of basis states ) of the family .    the lowest - level states ( the unsqueezable states ) clearly have to be of one of the two types : ( i ) @xmath59 or ( ii ) @xmath60 .",
    "the type - i state corresponds to the ground state up to a global galilean boost and the type - ii to states with a single hole excitation .",
    "these one - hole states are eigenstates of @xmath26 and , furthermore , since the following superposed state @xmath61 where @xmath62 , can be expanded purely in terms of the one - hole eigenstates , @xmath63 describes a state with a hole localized at @xmath64 .",
    "the matrix representation of @xmath26 acting on the partially ordered state space is always triangular since the action of @xmath26 on a given state always generates states belonging to lower levels .",
    "the eigenvalues , therefore , are simply given by the diagonal matrix elements .",
    "in particular the energy of an eigenstate spanned by a family with the highest - level mother - state @xmath65 is given by @xmath66 the off - diagonal elements are given by @xmath67            e_{\\bf n}^{(1 ) } & \\mbox{if $ \\nu > \\mu$ } , \\\\",

    "is divided into two subsections : the first introduces the conventional notations used in mathematical literatures and the second some of the general properties of jack polynomials .",
    "_ partitions _ are defined as sequences of non - negative integers in non - increasing order and are used to label the symmetric polynomials .",
    "they are denoted by bold - face greek letters as @xmath91 where @xmath92 .",
    "non - zero @xmath93 are called _ parts _ of @xmath94 whose _ length _",
    "( i.e. , the total number of non - zero _ parts _ ) is denoted by @xmath95 .",
    "the _ weight _ of the partition is defined by @xmath96 . if @xmath97 for all @xmath98 , then @xmath99 .",

    "is situated in the @xmath103-th row and the @xmath104-th column of the young diagram .",
    "the diagram of @xmath94 , therefore , consists of @xmath95 rows of lengths @xmath93 .",
    "a _ conjugate _ of @xmath94 is denoted by @xmath105 and corresponds to a partition whose diagram is obtained by changing all the rows of @xmath100 to columns in non - increasing order from the left to right .",
    "for example , the conjugate of @xmath106 is @xmath107 .",
    "now , the following simple but useful identity can be derived @xcite @xmath108 in order prove eq .",
    "( [ simpleid ] ) every cell in the @xmath103th row of @xmath100 is filled in with an integer @xmath109 . since @xmath110 corresponds to the sum of all the integers in the diagram ,",
    "the two different expressions for @xmath111 are obtained depending on whether the numbers in each row or column are summed first .    for a given cell @xmath112 of a diagram @xmath100",
    "there are corresponding _ arm - length _",
    "@xmath113 , _ arm - colength _",
    "@xmath114 , _ leg - length _",
    "@xmath115 , and _ leg - colength _ @xmath116 .",
    "upper _ and _ lower hook - lengths _ are defined , respectively , as @xmath117      the symmetric polynomials are indexed by the partitions .",
    "the bosonic basis functions @xmath29 of the csm are called the monomial symmetric functions and the quantum numbers @xmath118 correspond to the partitions defined in the previous subsection .",
    "since the quantum numbers are allowed to be negative integers , the correspondence is only up to some trivial constant translation or the global galilean boost .",
    "this restriction to non - negative integer parts is more of a convenience than a restriction since the csm hamiltonian is invariant under the global galilean transformation .",

    "i divide this section into two subsections . in the first ( second ) subsection",
    "the fractional _ exchange _ ( _ exclusion _ ) statistics is discussed in the context of one - dimensional models .",
    "the exchange statistics in two - dimension is directly relevant to the fractional quantum hall effect and various people have made contributions to this fascinating field @xcite . in one - dimension , however , the definition of fractional exchange statistics is rather obscure and incomplete with a possible exception of the csm .",
    "one the other hand , the definition of fractional exclusion statistics is spatial dimension independent and is based on the structure of the hilbert space rather than the configuration space .",
    "while the fermions obey the well - known pauli exclusion principle , more exotic particles may obey a `` generalized exclusion principle . ''",
    "@xcite      the first full mathematical treatment of the fractional statistics is due mainly to leinaas and myrheim who used the multiply connected topological structure of the configuration space of collections of identical particles to show the possibility of exotic statistics in spatial dimension less than three @xcite .",
    "while their idea has been extensively applied to two - dimensional systems especially in the context of the fractional quantum hall effect , very little attention has been paid to the one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems .",
    "perhaps the main difficulty in 1d systems is that the physical exchanges of the particles necessarily involve scattering processes and that there is no known unique way of un - tangling the kinematic aspect of the fractional statistics from the dynamical processes .    for integrable 1d quantum systems",
    ", however , there is a general consistency condition known as the yang - baxter equation ( ybe ) which essentially puts strong restrictions on the scattering matrices .",
    "therefore , intuitively the braiding of the particle `` trajectories '' in one - dimension when properly defined may be given by the ybe @xcite .",
    "in fact the ybe is known to be intimately related to the the knot theory and the braid groups @xcite .",
    "hence , perhaps the following quantum yang - baxter equation should be interpreted as the one - dimensional generalized braiding relations , @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the scattering matrix in the tensor product of linear vector spaces , @xmath152 and acts non - trivially only in the @xmath103th and @xmath104th space , e.g. @xmath153 where @xmath154 is a matrix defined in @xmath155 . the parameters @xmath156 and @xmath157 are called spectral parameters and are equal to the rapidity differences between two colliding particles",

    "the matrices @xmath165 satisfy the following relations @xmath166 without the spectral parameters the @xmath167 matrices satisfy the braiding relations .",
    "the complete description of the fractional statistics based on the ybe needs to be worked out .    at present",
    "it seems unclear to me how the construction based on the ybe can be applied to a general 1d ( i.e. , not necessarily integrable ) systems .",
    "maybe there is a way to map a class of general 1d models to integrable models with in some sense small residual interactions that break the integrability . instead of pursuing this incomplete yang - baxter story",
    "any further , i give here somewhat heuristic but intuitive device for constructing the 1d fractional statistics .",
    "the @xmath168-particle state is constructed as follow @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the anyon creation operator .",

    "( [ multiv ] ) .",
    "the other is to introduce the chern - simons gauge field and write the hamiltonian in terms of this gauge field and further require that the wavefunctions be single valued and symmetric .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ newhamil ] ) corresponds to the 1d version of the second formulation of the fractional exchange statistics .",
    "hence , the following symmetric wavefunctions are the eigenstates of the 1d anyon system @xmath178 where the `` ordering function '' @xmath179 is introduced to maintain the total wavefunction symmetric @xcite .",
    "in particular @xmath179 keeps track of the braiding of the particles and is set to cancel the exchange phases arising from @xmath180 .",
    "i require the ordering function to satisfy @xmath181 where the hat over the variable denotes the absence of that variable from the function .",
    "in other words , to remove the particle at @xmath182 it is necessary to pass through @xmath183 particles .    in section",
    "[ sec : edge ] i construct explicit second quantized `` anyon '' fields and show their consistency with the first quantized formulation of the fractional exchange statistics for the csm .",
    "the notion of fractional _ exclusion _ statistics based on the so called `` generalized pauli exclusion principle '' has first been formulated by haldane and applied to the elementary topological excitations of general condensed matter systems @xcite .",
