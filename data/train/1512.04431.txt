    "has received considerable attention  @xcite .",
    "particularly , a strong suppression of the scattered light with respect to the noninteracting atom case was observed very recently @xcite .",
    "meanwhile the research on the collective spontaneous emission extends to solid ensembles such as an ensemble of quantum dots ( qds )  @xcite , where the excitation can be transferred via charge tunneling  @xcite , long - range radiative interaction or dipole - dipole interaction  @xcite .",

    "the presence of collective effects tends to decrease the sensitivity in precise measurement of time using atomic transitions .",
    "this weakness is proved to be removable lately by a redesign of the ramsey - pulse sequence  @xcite . also , an ensemble of rydberg atoms has strong dipole - dipole interactions and long radiative lifetimes  @xcite and this makes it interesting for the research of many - body quantum physics  @xcite .",
    "other types of cooperative effects are observed in cold matter .",
    "for instance , in an ultracold boson ensemble trapped in a one - dimensional harmonic confinement , the quantum breathing dynamics was investigated from few- to many - body systems  @xcite .    when a mixture or spatially separated atomic ensembles are involved",
    "then additional novel behaviors are expected .",

    "the correlated phase dynamics of two mesoscopic ensembles of atoms through their collective coupling to an optical cavity was described as well in  @xcite .",
    "if two mesoscopic atomic ensembles interact via the common vacuum modes of an electromagnetic field reservoir which acts as an engineered environment , steady - state entanglement between these two distant atomic ensembles at room temperature can be generated  @xcite .",
    "recent investigation shows that two far separated subgroups of slow two - level atoms in a weak resonant laser field can be entangled , if they are big enough  @xcite .",
    "finally , the dipole - dipole interactions among two rydberg - blockaded atom clouds break up the super - atoms by removing the excitations from the clouds  @xcite .    motivated by these excellent studies , here , we investigate an atomic ensemble formed from two different type of atoms and each of them is pumped separately by a resonant coherent laser field .",

    "dipole interaction potential .",

    "after a few oscillations , the system reaches its steady - state quickly on a time scale of the decay . the frequency of these oscillations does not satisfy the definition of collective rabi frequency @xmath51 @xcite because our system is not described by a collective state with only one excitation , i.e. , we have taken the possibility of multi - excitations into consideration .",

    "the cross - interaction allows the photon exchange among different kinds of emitters , which has higher possibility for larger @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , for fixed laser intensities , the number of excitations are larger when the cross - interaction parameter @xmath54 increases .",

    "although collective population jumps are well - known in pumped multi - atom ensembles @xcite , here , we have only few or several atom jumps from a collection of atoms . the cross - interaction can be controlled , for example , by changing the atomic pressure in the mixture or the optical lattice constant . an alternative parameter to study the effect of the cross - interaction @xmath54 on the excitation number is the probability to excite @xmath76 atoms in the first atomic ensemble , i.e. , @xmath77 . at the front edge of the _ jump _ ( the low excitation regime ) ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the atoms prefer to remain in the ground state and it is more likely to excite only one or two atoms at once . the atomic distribution @xmath78 becomes broader for larger @xmath54 , which means the possibility of multi - excitation is higher .",

    "the time oscillating term proportional to @xmath85 can be considered as a fast oscillating term when the frequency of oscillations @xmath86 is significant larger than @xmath87 . respectively , from eq .",
    "( [ dmp ] ) , for the spontaneous emission damping the cross - correlations can be ignored if @xmath88 . with the parameters we are interested in ,",
    "these two conditions are not fulfilled so that the time oscillating term @xmath89 can not be treated as fast oscillating terms .",
    "therefore , the effects of these terms can not be simply averaged to zero . in our numerical calculations ,",
    "the cross - contributions are shown to be important , which bring the oscillations in the dynamics and make it possible to sustain the excitations .      from the physical point of view",
    ", the cross - interaction considers the feasibility to exchange photons among different species of emitters , and plays a role similar to an _ additional pumping source _ , with a frequency @xmath92 .",
    "the strength of the _ additional pump _ depends on the number of excited atoms , the decay of the emitters , and of course the cross - interaction strength .",
    "when the cross - interaction is strong , the extra pump can be compared with the driving lasers , and may strongly modify the system s time evolution . with zero cross - interaction ,",
    "the system reaches its steady - state quickly , however , when @xmath55 , the feedback effect makes it more difficult to achieve a steady - state . in our mixed system , the photon exchanging among different species of emitters compensates the negative effect of spontaneous decay and reconstructs the rabi oscillations .",

    "[ fig4](a ) the amplitude increases with @xmath54 .",
    "notice that the phase difference of the driving lasers @xmath94 also contributes to the hamiltonian , but only as an initial phase in @xmath89 . with the existence of cross - interactions , the photon exchanging among different species of emitters may carry the information of @xmath94 .",
    "however , @xmath94 will not affect the amplitude or the frequency of the oscillations , and may not cause the jumps we observed in excitations .",
