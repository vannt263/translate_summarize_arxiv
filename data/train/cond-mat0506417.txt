    "the practical interest of extending the navier - stokes equations to smaller length scales comes from the need to model re - entrance of space vehicles and in later times from nano scale technology . in this parameter region",
    "there is in general the boltzmann equation .",
    "as the collision integral is very heavy to calculate numerically , the boltzmann equation is usually applied for fairly simple or idealized problems , see cercignani @xcite .",
    "an other method is that of dsmc due to bird @xcite .",
    "but in the collision dominated region also dsmc is very demanding computationally .",
    "hence special methods are valuable when the knudsen number is too large for the navier - stokes equations to apply but still small enough to allow for an expansion .",
    "a fruitful technique in this region is the asymptotic method , originating with hilbert and grad , see sone @xcite .",
    "the navier - stokes equations were derived from the boltzmann equation by the chapman - enskog method , see chapman & cowling @xcite .",
    "they are to first order in the mean free path .",
    "the corresponding equations to second order in the mean free path were derived by burnett @xcite , see also @xcite . however , the burnett equations were proven by bobylev @xcite to have a nonphysical instability .",
    "see also the review by agarwal et al agarwal and the paper by uribe et al .",
    "@xcite .    for the burnett equations",
    "the trivial state of rest is thus unstable for perturbations of a wavelength of the order of the mean free path and shorter .",
    "the chapman - enskog method is an expansion in the knudsen number @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the mean free path and @xmath4 a characteristic length .",
    "wavelengths of the order of the mean free path and larger correspond to an effective knudsen number of the order @xmath5 and larger .",
    "so there is no contradiction in the fact that the burnett equations are unstable for short wavelengths .",
    "the physical content of the burnett equations is for solutions with a characteristic length which is large enough .",
    "but nevertheless the equations should be wellbehaved for all length scales .",
    "this is necessary mathematically as well as numerically .",
    "as pointed out by agarwal et al @xcite burnett s original expression for the viscous pressure tensor contains the time derivative of the traceless rate of deformation tensor .",
    "chapman &  cowling replace the time derivative by spatial derivatives using the equations at the euler level .",
    "agarwal et al give the name conventional burnett equations to the resulting equations .",
    "there is a similar replacement for the time derivative of the temperature gradient .",
    "this method of replacement using the zero order equations is part of the procedure in the chapman - enskog method to obtain the navier - stokes equations from the boltzmann equation to first order of the knudsen number .",
    "agarwal et al also raise the question if the instability of the conventional burnett equations is caused by this replacement , so that possibly the original burnett equations are linearly stable . in the present paper",
    "we show that the original burnett equations have an unphysical singularity . in jin jin and slemrod introduce @xmath6 as new independent fields and propose 13 equations , first order in time and second order in space .",
    "see also the two master theses by svrd @xcite and by strmgren @xcite and the paper by sderholm @xcite based on essentially the same idea but with equations which are first order in time as well as space . in the paper @xcite these equations are applied numerically for nonlinear sound waves .    in the present paper",
    "we introduce a two parameter partial replacement of the mentioned time derivatives and show that the parameters can be chosen to give linear stability .",
    "we then choose the parameters such that the resulting equations are as close to the original and conventional equations as possible .",
    "the resulting equations are more similar to the already studied burnett equations than those in @xcite and @xcite and it seems that it should be simpler to reduce a numerical scheme for the equations to one for the navier - stokes equations .",
