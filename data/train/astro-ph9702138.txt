    "the polarization of starlight , first discovered by hiltner ( 1949 ) and hall ( 1949 ) , implies that the axes of dust grains are partially aligned with the interstellar magnetic field , .",
    "models of the davis - greenstein ( dg ) effect and other grain alignment mechanisms generally predict the alignment of the grain angular momentum , , with respect to ( for a recent review , see roberge 1996 ) .",
    "however , to relate the predictions of these models to observations , one also requires the `` internal distribution '' of  in grain body coordinates .",
    "the classical papers on dg alignment ( jones & spitzer 1967 ; purcell & spitzer 1971 ) assumed that the internal distribution is determined by gas damping and other external processes",
    ". however , purcell ( 1979 , hereafter p79 ) realized that frictional processes internal to the grain will dissipate rotational energy into heat on a timescale that is generally much shorter than the timescales for external interactions .",
    "since they conserve angular momentum , these internal dissipation processes tend to drive the grain toward the state of minimum energy consistent with a fixed value of , rotation about the principal axis of largest rotational inertia ( henceforth the `` major axis of inertia '' ) .",
    "several internal dissipation processes were discussed by p79 , who found that `` barnett dissipation '' is the dominant effect for typical interstellar grains .",
    "the mechanism is very elegant : dolginov & mytrophanov ( 1976 ) pointed out that a rotating grain has a magnetization @xmath0 due to the barnett effect , where @xmath1 is the magnetic susceptibility , @xmath2 is the magnetogyric ratio of the paramagnetic spins , and  is the grain angular velocity .",
    "it is well known from theoretical mechanics ( e.g. , landau & lifshitz 1976 ) that precesses in body coordinates unless the rotation axis coincides with a principal axis of the inertia tensor .",
    "reasoning by analogy with ordinary paramagnetic dissipation in a time - dependent external magnetic field , p79 concluded that internal dissipation must also be caused by the time - dependent `` barnett equivalent magnetic field , '' @xmath3 .",
    "virtually all models of interstellar polarization developed since 1979 have assumed that barnett dissipation aligns  _ perfectly _ with the major axis of inertia .",
    "however , lazarian ( 1994 , henceforth l94 ) has pointed out that this is a poor approximation if the grains rotate with thermal kinetic energies : thermal fluctuations in the barnett magnetization will excite rotation about all 3 of the body axes , preventing perfect alignment unless the rotation is suprathermal or the grain solid temperature is zero .    the first model of internal relaxation to include thermal fluctuations was presented by l94 , who modeled the kinetics of barnett relaxation by analogy with the dg effect .",
    "however , this analogy is not exact because , unlike barnett relaxation , the dg effect involves external , nonconservative torques .",
    "this difficulty was ignored for the sake of simplicity by l94 and we now revisit the problem in order to carry out an exact analysis . in ",
    "2 we compare the efficiency of various dissipation mechanisms in order to delineate the circumstances under which the barnett effect is the dominant process . in ",
    "3 we discuss barnett alignment in an isolated grain whose angular momentum has a fixed but arbitrary magnitude , @xmath4 .",
    "the value of @xmath4 is determined by interactions of the grain with its environment and in  4 we formulate a kinetic model wherein the external interactions are provided by gas - grain collisions and the evaporation of molecules from the grain surface .",
    "we calculate the appropriate measure of internal alignment numerically in  5 and calibrate the accuracy of our results by considering special cases where exact solutions can be obtained analytically .",
    "our results are discussed in  6 and summarized in  7 .",
    "inelastic dissipation and barnett dissipation were identified in p79 as the two major causes of internal dissipation .",
    "inelastic dissipation is caused by the oscillating stresses associated with the motion of the grain angular velocity , , in body coordinates .",
    "it is possible to show that the timescale for inelastic dissipation , @xmath5 , scales as @xmath6 compared to @xmath7 for the barnett dissipation time , @xmath8 ( see eq .",
    "( [ 2.9 ] ) ) . as a result ,",
    "inelastic dissipation is the dominant process for sufficiently large angular velocities .",
    "however , for sufficiently rigid grains , these velocities lie in the range of suprathermal rotation ; therefore , we consider only barnett dissipation in the present paper , which deals with thermally rotating grains .",
    "the interesting problem of inelastic dissipation in dust grains will be discussed elsewhere .    as we pointed out above",
    ", barnett dissipation tends to align  with the major axis of inertia ( see  1 ) .",
    "henceforth we will model the grains as oblate spheroids with semiaxes @xmath9 parallel to  and @xmath10 ( with @xmath11 ) perpendicular to , where  is the symmetry axis ( = the major axis of inertia ) .",
    "barnett dissipation decreases the angle @xmath12 between and  at a rate @xmath13 ( p79 ; roberge , degraff , & flaherty 1993 , henceforth rdgf93 ) , where @xmath14 @xmath15 is the grain volume , @xmath16 is the inertia for rotation about an axis perpendicular to , @xmath17 , @xmath18 is related to the imaginary part of the magnetic susceptibility at frequency @xmath19 by @xmath20\\over\\omega}\\approx   1.2\\times 10^{-13}\\left(\\frac{t_s}{15k}\\right ) , \\label{2.8}\\ ] ] and  is the grain solid temperature .",
    "the scaling of @xmath18 in equation ( [ 2.8 ] ) is appropriate for ordinary paramagnetic materials ( see draine 1996 ) ; for superparamagnetic grains , @xmath18 should be increased by an uncertain factor @xmath21 .",
    "we define the barnett time , , to be the value of @xmath22 , so that @xmath23 the numerical value of  depends on @xmath4 ; a typical angular momentum for thermal rotation at the gas temperature , , is @xmath24 and the corresponding numerical value of  is @xmath25 for a grain with radius @xmath26 cm and density @xmath27 .",
    "we may say that eq .",
    "( [ 2.9 ] ) describes barnett dissipation for an individual grain with fixed angular momentum @xmath4 , while eq .",
    "( [ 2.10 ] ) decsribes barnett dissipation for an ensemble of grains with rotational temperature .",
    "barnett dissipation is able to transform rotational energy into heat because coupling exists between the grain rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom .",
    "however , the existence of this coupling implies that energy can also be transferred in the opposite direction , i.e. , from vibration to rotation ( see jones & spitzer 1967 ) . as a result",
    ", fluctuations in the thermal energy will randomly excite rotation about all three body axes with energies of order @xmath28 .",
    "if the rotational energy of the grain is @xmath29 , then these thermal fluctuations are negligible and barnett dissipation aligns  perfectly with .",
    "this is the assumption adopted by p79 , who was concerned only with rotation at highly superthermal energies .",
    "however , the grains in molecular clouds are likely to have rotational energies @xmath30 .",
    "consequently , it is of great practical interest to determine the distribution of orientations established by the combined effects of barnett dissipation and thermal fluctuations .",
    "this distribution can be calculated analytically for an isolated grain .",
    "let  be the distribution function for @xmath12 , defined so that @xmath31 is the probability of finding  oriented between @xmath12 and @xmath32 .",
    "here we regard @xmath33 to be a function of @xmath12 with @xmath4 a fixed but arbitrary parameter ; the determination of @xmath4 by external interactions is discussed in  4 . since the grain is assumed to be an isolated system in thermodynamic equilubrium ,   can be found , in principle , by maximizing the entropy of the combined rotation / vibration system .",
    "however , the calculation is drastically simplified by noting that the number of vibrational degrees of freedom ( @xmath34@xmath35 , where @xmath35 is the number of atoms in the grain ) is vastly greater than the number of rotational degrees of freedom ( = @xmath36 ) .",
    "thus , the rotational degrees of freedom may be regarded as a small system immersed in a heat bath at constant temperature , .",

    "the difference in rotational energy between the minimum @xmath44 and maximum @xmath45 rotational energy `` states '' of a grain is @xmath46 [ see eq .",
    "( [ 3.2 ] ) ] .",
    "thus , @xmath47 is just the ratio of the energy required to disorient  to the energy added to rotation by a typical thermal fluctuation .",
    "weak alignment ( @xmath48 ) occurs when a typical fluctuation is large enough to disorient  ( @xmath49 ) , corresponding to nearly - spherical grains ( @xmath50 ) or thermal rotation energies ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "strong alignment ( @xmath52 ) occurs only for nonspherical grains and suprathermal rotation .",
    "the effects of external interactions can be included by solving the fokker - planck equation , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is time , @xmath55 is the joint distribution for @xmath4 and @xmath12 , and  is the probability current .",
    "the latter is given in general by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the mean torque and @xmath58 is the diffusion tensor . in principle ,  and @xmath59 include the cumulative effects of every process that changes  in the body frame . in this paper",
    ", we consider the effects of barnett dissipation and gas damping but neglect the effects of other external interactions such as the davis - greenstein mechanism . as a result",
    ", our calculations accurately describe the internal angular momentum distribution only under conditions where the gas damping time is much smaller than the timescale for other external processes .",
    "we assume that the grain center of mass is at rest with respect to the gas ; the generalization of the results presented here to gold - type alignment will be considered in subsequent papers ( lazarian 1997b ; roberge & lazarian 1997b ) .",
    "we also assume that the properties of the grains and their environment are steady on timescales much longer than the gas damping and barnett times , so that only the steady solution of the fokker - planck equation is of interest .",
    "it is simplest to calculate @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the mean torque and diffusion tensor associated with barnett relaxation , in a spherical polar coordinate system with basis , where the polar axis is parallel to the grain symmetry axis .",
    "the conservation of @xmath4 by the barnett effect and the azimuthal symmetry of an oblate spheroid together imply that the only nonvanishing components are  and .",

    "further , the rate of every microscopic process equals the rate of the time - reversed process in thermodynamic equilibrium ( the `` principle of detailed balance '' ) , so the probability current must vanish at every point in phase space . writing out the components of  in polar coordinates and setting @xmath63 , we find that detailed balance requires @xmath64 = 0 . \\label{4.6}\\ ] ] expression ( [ 4.6 ] ) is a first - order differential equation for .",

    "typical results for realistic calculations including gas damping and barnett relaxation are shown in figures  3 and 4 .",
    "as noted above , the case @xmath124 corresponds to the maxwellian regime and , appropriately , all of the solutions in figures  3 and 4 converge to the maxwellian case as @xmath125 . as @xmath113 increases ,",

    "this limit represents the maximum possible enhancement of the alignment ( relative to ) which can be produced by barnett relaxation in a thermally - rotating grain .",
    "the qualitative behavior of the results presented in figures  3 and 4 is consistent with the predictions of l94 .",
    "for example , the maximum efficiency of barnett alignment decreases as  increases and as the grains become more spherical .",
    "note that the oscillations which occur for large @xmath113 in figs .  3 and 4 are spurious , that is , they are too large to be statistical fluctuations .",
    "the oscillations are probably an artifact of the ad hoc prescription we use to treat the singularities in  at @xmath129 and @xmath130 [ see eq .",
    "( [ 4.7 ] ) ] : in computing , we set @xmath131 whenever the trajectory `` visits '' the interval @xmath132 and similarly for points in the interval @xmath133 .",
    "this procedure is motivated by the fact that the fluctuations in @xmath12 are proportional to @xmath134 [ see eq .",
    "( [ 4.21 ] ) ] . for some value of @xmath135 , the fluctuations for @xmath136 become so large that the grain is completely disoriented and , roughly speaking , the precise values of the fluctuations ought to be irrelevant .",
    "after experimenting with different choices , we set @xmath137rad for the calculations presented in figs .  3 and 4 .",
    "the fact that the solutions in figures  3 and 4 approach limiting values for large @xmath113 is a consequence of elementary thermodynamic considerations .",
    "the case @xmath138 corresponds to conditions where @xmath12 evolves rapidly ( on a timescale @xmath139 ) due to the effects of barnett relaxation while @xmath4 evolves slowly ( on a timescale @xmath140 ) due to gas damping .",
    "the disparity between  and  means that , insofar as the motion of @xmath12 is concerned , we may regard @xmath4 as a slowly - varying parameter .",
    "thus , if we compute the measure of alignment by averaging the motion of @xmath12 over times much longer than  but much shorter than , the result will be @xmath141 , the approximation becoming exact in the limit @xmath142 .",
    "we conclude that the asymptotic behavior of the solutions in figures  3 and 4 occurs because , when @xmath138 , the distribution of @xmath12 is always close to the thermodynamic equilibrium distribution and the latter is independent of @xmath113 .",
    "accordingly , we will refer to the case @xmath138 as the `` thermodynamic regime . '' of course ,  depends on the value of @xmath4 , so the value of @xmath99 computed by the `` short - time averaging '' procedure described above will change quasi - statically as gas damping slowly changes the magnitude of the angular momentum .",
    "thus , it is necessary to compute @xmath99 by averaging the motion over many gas damping times , as we have done for the calculations shown in figures  3 and 4 .    for real interstellar grains ,",
    "the barnett time is typically a few orders of magnitude shorter than the gas damping time [ compare eqs .",
    "( [ 2.10 ] ) and ( [ 4.20 ] ) ]",
    "so the solutions of practical interest in future applications correspond to @xmath143@xmath144 .",
    "although we are unable to compute solutions for  values this large ( because the langevin equation becomes too stiff ) , figures  3 and 4 suggest that the solutions are already close to the limit @xmath145 when @xmath146 .",
    "accordingly , values of @xmath99 computed for @xmath146 should be good approximations to the results of practical interest .",
    "we have calculated the measure of internal alignment as a function of @xmath80 and  for the case @xmath146 ; the resulting values of @xmath99 appear as the upper entries in table  1 . the entries for @xmath147",

    "we have plotted these entries as open circles in figure  2 ; the rms error in @xmath99 is @xmath148 for these points .    because the distribution of @xmath12 is always close to the thermodynamic equilibrium distribution when  is large",
    ", one should be able to approximate the values of @xmath99 in table  1 by an expression of the form @xmath149 where  is some `` effective @xmath4-value . ''",

    "for each parameter combination , the lower entry in table  1 gives the corresponding value of @xmath152 .",
    "figure  5 gives a graphical comparison between selected results from the table and the `` @xmath153 '' approximation the agreement is generally good , although the @xmath153 approximation systematically underestimates @xmath99 for points with @xmath154 .",
    "this systematic discrepancy is likely due to errors in the numerical solutions associated with the singularity in  at @xmath129 rather than the quality of the approximation . in view of the various uncertainties in grain properties ,",
    "e.g. , in the rotational temperature and rotational inertias , we regard the @xmath153 approximation as a reasonable method for estimating the degree of barnett alignment in real grains when gas damping is the dominant external interaction .",
    "the study of internal relaxation presented in this paper includes the physics of barnett relaxation and gas damping but does not include the davis - greenstein effect or gold s mechanism .",
    "a quantitative study including the omitted processes is a challenging problem , which we address in subsequent papers in this series ( lazarian 1997a and roberge & lazarian 1997a for the davis - greenstein mechanism and lazarian 1997b and roberge & lazarian 1997b for gold s mechanism ) . without going into details",
    ", we may summarize the qualitative effects of incomplete barnett alignment on the dg and gold mechanisms as follows .",
    "because the dg and gold mechanisms are both concerned with the alignment of  with respect to , the wobbling of a thermally - rotating grain about its angular momentum ( which occurs when barnett alignment is imperfect ) will result in a decrease in its polarizing efficiency relative to the case for perfect barnett alignment . according to calculations based on the assumption of perfect barnett alignment ( lazarian 1994",
    "; roberge , hanany , & messinger 1995 ) , the efficiency of gold alignment depends on the orientation dependence of a grain s cross section for collisions with streaming gas particles , in the sense that the alignment becomes more efficient as this difference increases . the precession of the grain axes about  which occurs when barnett alignment is imperfect will generally reduce this difference .",
    "consequently , we anticipate that imperfect barnett alignment will reduce the efficiency of dg and gold alignment for thermally - rotating grains .",
    "conversely , the dg and gold mechanisms affect the efficiency of barnett alignment .",
    "paramagnetic dissipation in the interstellar magnetic field will decrease the barnett alignment by reducing the value of @xmath4 . on the other hand , gold s mechanism _",
    "increases _ @xmath4 and therefore increases the efficiency of barnett alignment .",
    "strangely , incomplete barnett relaxation increases the efficiency of paramagnetic alignment if the grains rotate suprathermally by increasing the correlation in the directions of  before and after crossover events ( lazarian & draine 1997 ) .",
    "the principal results of this paper are as follows :    1 .",
    "we have presented an exact formulation of the physics of barnett relaxation which includes the effects of thermal fluctuations in the grain material .",
    "we have shown that the measure of internal alignment , @xmath99 , depends only on 3 dimensionless parameters in the approximation where the external torques on the grain are dominated by gas damping .",
    "these parameters are the grain axis ratio , @xmath80 , the dust - to - gas temperature ratio , , and a `` barnett damping parameter , '' .",
    "we have calculated @xmath99 for a large number of parameter combinations .",
    "we have obtained an analytic approximation that accurately reproduces our numerical solutions in the portion of parameter space relevant to studies of interstellar polarization .",
    "5 .   the results of this paper confirm the conclusion of l94 , that the alignment of  with respect to the axis of major inertia is incomplete for thermally - rotating grains .",
    "the incomplete alignment stems from thermal fluctuations within the grain material and becomes increasingly significant as the grain temperature rises .",
    "the rotation of a grain with  parallel to its major axis of inertia corresponds to the minimum kinetic energy for a given @xmath4 value .",
    "thermal fluctuations disorient  because they transfer energy from the grain solid material to the rotational degrees of freedom . in a steady state",
    ", energy is transferred back to the grain material at an equal rate by barnett dissipation .",
    "it is important to include incomplete barnett alignment in studies which relate grain alignment theory to polarimetric data .",
    "the polarization of electromagnetic radiation is caused by the preferential alignment of the grain axes .",
