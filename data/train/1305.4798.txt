    "surfactants , amphiphiles and copolymers in selective solvents are widely used to create micelles . for several applications the size , size distribution , loading capacity and stability ( upon dilution ) are requirements of great importance .",
    "it is feasible to invoke the statistical thermodynamical machinery on invariably coarse grained models to find detailed information on self - assembly phenomena .",
    "however , the insights from this have a qualitative rather than a quantitative character because of a lack of suitable parameter sets for such systems .",
    "this is why in practice the selection of appropriate copolymers capable of forming micelles with pre - set requirements is still based on trial and error or on experience rather than on theory .",
    "confronting theory with experiments is the only way to improve this situation .    in this paper",
    "our focus is on triblock copolymers in a selective solvent ( water ) .",
    "several triblock copolymers have been studied both from a theoretical- @xcite as well as from a practical @xcite perspective .",
    "many of these polymers , such as the poloxamers , were selected to have a finite ( reasonably high ) solubility in water , implying that if the systems are diluted below their critical micelle concentration ( cmc ) , the micelles break up into freely dissolved unimers . when these micelles are used to encapsulate compounds then , upon dilution below the cmc",
    ", their cargo is released .",
    "we study biocompatible triblock copolymers that have a very limited water solubility .",
    "the micelles may still be used as drug carriers as one can employ alternative release strategies .",
    "more specifically , we use copolymers made from plga @xcite or pcl @xcite as the hydrophobic fragment and peo as the hydrophilic species .",
    "the plga and pcl blocks are biodegradable by hydrolysis of the esters and or are subject to enzymatic degradation @xcite and the peo block is mainly excretable via the renal pathway @xcite .",
    "the block lengths of the plga - peo - plga and pcl - peo - pcl polymers are chosen such that they exhibit ultra - low water solubilities .",
    "experimentally one can reproducibly fabricate micellar objects by the precipitation method and the corresponding micelles may be referred to as frozen or dead because after their formation they do not dissolve by dilution .",
    "our interest is in the modeling of these structurally quenched systems by using an equilibrium self - consistent field ( scf ) theory .",
    "this is not a trivial exercise because the micellar system clearly violates the important prerequisite of equilibration .",
    "we may justify our approach _ postiori _",
    ", because for a particular set of interaction parameters it is found that there exists a good correlation between the predicted micelle structure and experimental observations .",
    "association colloids composed of molecules in strongly selective solvents have a densely packed core and a solvated corona .",
    "based on this , particularly in the surfactant literature , the surfactant packing parameter @xmath1 is used to assess the capability of some amphiphile to form a certain association colloid . here",
    "@xmath2 is the volume of the hydrophobic block(s ) ( tails ) , @xmath3 is the length of the tail(s ) and @xmath4 is the surface area occupied by the polar fragments ( head ) at the cmc . for @xmath5",
    "spherical micelles are preferred , whereas for @xmath6 cylindrical micelles form . in the range",
    "@xmath7 vesicles , for @xmath8 planar bilayers and for @xmath9 reversed spherical micelles are expected @xcite . for surfactants that have relatively short tails with little conformational degrees of freedom , the main problem in using",
    "the packing parameter concept is to estimate @xmath10 .",
    "this quantity can be derived from experiments . for polymeric self - assembly",
    "there are more hurdles to take .",
    "in addition to the issue to know the area per head group , it is important to account for the conformational degrees of freedom of the copolymers .    in the field of polymer self - assembly it is known that the thermodynamic stability of micelles depend on the size of the core compared to that of the corona @xcite .",
    "more specifically , a particular geometry is stable when the corona is large compared to the core .",
    "considering , for example , micelles of which the corona is relatively small , the system is expected to reduce the curvature . in the cylindrical geometry the ratio between surface area and volume is less and the corona chains are forced to stretch outward in the radial direction so that the size of the corona increases compared to the core . with a similar argument",
    "one can envision the choice of a system for the lamellar phase . in order to use this insight as a predictive tool",
    ", one must get involved in the field of polymer brushes and in particular the physics of curved polymer brushes . the analytical methods to estimate the core and corona sizes",
    "is mostly limited to scaling relations which must be somehow calibrated .    by using the scf theory and evoking a molecularly realistic model of the polymers",
    ", we can resolve these problems to a large extend .",
    "this gives us the capability to predict structural properties of the micelles for given composition of the copolymers .    in the following",
    "we will first give a brief introduction on the sf - scf theory for micellisation .",
    "subsequently our results are discussed and compared to experimental data presented in more detail in the companion publication @xcite . in our conclusions we elaborate on the use of an equilibrium theory to describe micelles formed by the precipitation method .",
    "micellar solutions are macroscopically homogeneous",
    ". first and second law of thermodynamics for homogeneous solutions with @xmath11 different molecular components , the total numbers of molecules of the @xmath12 component @xmath13 , consisting of @xmath14 components with a chemical potential of all components @xmath15 , give for the change of the internal energy d@xmath16 for a homogeneous phase : @xmath17 where the sum is over all molecular components , @xmath18 is the entropy and @xmath19 the system volume . for systems at a given temperature @xmath20 and pressure",
    "@xmath21 it is often better to turn to the gibbs energy @xmath22 and the change in the gibbs energy reads : @xmath23 classical thermodynamics can not account for micellisation as specific correlations between molecules are fully acceptable from a thermodynamic perspective and the equations in the presence or in the absence of some finite size aggregates are completely the same .",
    "equations only start to be different as soon as macroscopic phase changes occur .    motivated by the knowledge that on some microscopic level the system is inhomogeneous , it may be of interest to consider the small system approach advocated by hill @xcite .",
    "hill suggested that when there is a hidden parameter , here the number of micelles @xmath24 , there is an intensive quantity @xmath25 , which hill referred to as the sub - division potential , coupled to the number of micelles and the change of the gibbs energy reads : @xmath26 from eq .",
    "[ dg _ ] it follows that the sub - division potential is the work ( gibbs energy ) needed to increase the number of micelles for given number of molecules , pressure and temperature . in equilibrium the gibbs energy should be minimized .",
    "this must also apply to the dependence of the gibbs energy on the number micelles : @xmath27 and the second derivative of the gibbs energy with number of micelles should be positive . in words , eq .",
    "[ gmin ] expresses that in equilibrium there is no gibbs energy associated to the formation of micelles and under these conditions eq .",
    "[ dg _ ] returns to eq .",
    "[ dg ] obviously .",
    "hence the small system approach is consistent with ( macroscopic ) thermodynamics .",
    "the interesting point of the small system approach is that scheutjens - fleer self consistent field ( sf - scf ) theory considers the system on the small system level and the small system thermodynamics approach becomes meaningful . in these calculations we focus on one micelle in the center of the spherical coordinate system",
    "of which we can change the aggregation number ( by considering the number of copolymers in the small system ) .",
    "we may use eq .",
    "[ gmin ] to select the relevant number of polymers per micelle .",
    "returning to eq .",
    "[ dg _ ] we notice that @xmath28 .",
    "the gibbs energy per micelle is thus : @xmath29 from which it follows that @xmath25 is interpreted as the excess gibbs energy per micelle .",
    "this quantity is also referred to as the grand potential @xmath30 per micelle .",
    "hence , equilibrium in the sf - scf protocol for micellisation is defined by the grand potential of the micelle being zero .",
    "below we will return to this issue obviously .",
    "we use the classical sf - scf model for self - assembly , which in the context of surfactant micellisation has been presented in the literature several times @xcite . here",
    "we will only outline the most important features so that the results of the modeling can be discussed properly .",
    "we will pay attention to ( i ) the discretization scheme , ( ii ) the molecular model , ( iii ) the optimization of the free energy , ( iv ) the propagator scheme and ( v ) the grand potential in the following subsections .",
    "the sf - scf model is lattice based .",
    "this means we have to define exactly how the lattice sites are organized . here and",
    "below we focus on the spherical lattice .",
    "we consider lattice sites with linear length @xmath31 and volume @xmath32 .",
    "the lattice sites are arranged in lattice layers with spherical topology . starting with a central point at @xmath33",
    ", we have layers of lattice sites at coordinate @xmath34 , which are a distance @xmath35 away from the center .",
    "the number of lattice sites at coordinate @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 , where the approximation on the rhs of this equation ( which is accurate only for large values of @xmath36 ) shows that the number of sites is related to the area of the shell at distance @xmath35 from the center .",
    "in this coordinate system we need to compute so - called site averages defined by a three - layer average of some spatially varying quantity @xmath38 , for which we use the angular bracket notation defined by : @xmath39 in this equation the _ a priori _ step probabilities account for the geometry @xmath40 for a cubic lattice , the limiting values , that is for large values of @xmath36 , of the step probabilities are @xmath41 and @xmath42 . for small values of @xmath36",
    "there is curvature information in the transition probabilities .",
    "the sf - scf theory makes use of the mean - field approximation . in practice",
    "this means that we are going to average various properties over all sites @xmath43 at a particular coordinate @xmath36 .",
    "scheutjens and fleer promoted the idea that the polymeric species should be expressed in segments that fit on the lattice .",
    "in other words , a coarse - grained description of the polymer chains is implemented . in this approach",
    "the polymers are considered as a string of segments with linear length @xmath31 .",
    "let us for convenience number the different molecules with the index @xmath44 and focus on linear chains of which the segments have ranking numbers @xmath45 .",
    "where @xmath46 is the total number of segments in the chain .",
    "the chain topology is an input for the calculations .",
    "this means that we have to specify exactly what the segment type is of each segment .",
    "segment types are generically referred with the index @xmath47 .",
    "for example , we may consider the symmetric triblock copolymers @xmath48 , which has segments of type @xmath49 for the ranking numbers @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and @xmath52 for the remaining ones @xmath53 .",
    "besides polymeric species there may also be monomeric compounds in the system .",
    "these are treated similar to the chains , yet they have just one segment @xmath54 . below we will assume that the solvent has a segment type @xmath18 and is monomeric .    for convenience",
    "we introduce the so - called chain architecture operators @xmath55 these values of these operators are fully defined by the input data .",
    "the target of the sf - scf equations is to find the equilibrium distribution of all segments and segment types in the coordinate system .",
    "the dimensionless concentration of segments of type @xmath47 at coordinate @xmath36 is given by the volume fraction @xmath56 , which is given by the ratio between the number of segments of type @xmath47 at this coordinate and the number of sites available : @xmath57 the sf - scf theory is based on a mean - field free energy expression .",
    "this expression features besides the segment volume fractions also segment potentials @xmath58 .",
    "physically , the segment potentials should be interpreted as the work needed to bring segment @xmath47 from the bulk to the coordinate @xmath36 . from this definition",
    "it follows that in the bulk the segment potentials are zero .      in the calculation ,",
    "the volume occupied by the @xmath59 lattice layers and the number of molecules are specified .",
    "hence , the gibbs energy is the primary thermodynamic potential in the system .",
    "schematically the gibbs energy @xmath60 can be presented as @xmath61 here and below we normalize all energies by the thermal energy @xmath62 .",

    "the fourth term implements the incompressibility constraint for each coordinate . in other words ,",
    "the value of the lagrange field @xmath68 is coupled to the requirement that on each coordinate the volume fractions add up to unity . in passing we",

    "[ gibbssf ] not automatically has physical significance : it needs to be minimized with respect to the volume fractions and maximized with respect to the segment potentials and the lagrange field . in equations we are looking for the so - called sf - scf point for which :    @xmath69    @xmath70    @xmath71    eq .",
    "[ scfa ] leads to an expression for the segment potentials in term of the volume fractions .",

    "for a freely - jointed chain , however , there exist an extraordinary efficient propagator formalism which exactly computes the volume fraction as specified by eq .",
    "this formalism is outlined in the next paragraph .      motivated by the close analogy between the diffusion of a brownian particle and the flight of a random walk ,",
    "there exist a diffusion - like equation to evaluate the partition function of gaussian chains .",
    "edwards @xcite realized that the difference between the diffusion process and the polymer chain is that the polymer can not visit previously occupied sites .",
    "this is known as the excluded - volume problem .",
    "he came up with a modified diffusion equation , which corrects , in first order , for the volume interactions which in spherical coordinates reads : @xmath79 which must be supplemented with initial and boundary conditions .",
    "the quantity @xmath80 which obeys to this differential equation is related to the partition function and can be used to compute the volume fraction distribution for a given chain molecule .",
    "we map this differential equation onto the lattice . here",
    "we can not go in full details and discuss the resulting formalism instead . by implementing it , the chain model changes from the gaussian chain to the freely jointed one .",

    "in passing we note that the normalization in eq .",
    "[ phi(r , s ) ] can be used to evaluate the volume fractions in the bulk .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath90 .",

    "we already mention that the sub - division potential is related to the grand potential @xmath30 .",
    "the formal difference between these two quantities is that in the grand potential as found in the sf - scf model , the translational entropy of the micelle as a whole is not accounted for , whereas in the sub - division potential the translational entropy is part of it .",
    "we will consider polymer micelles for which the degrees of freedom in the translation of the micelle as a whole can be ignored with respect to other contributions , and therefore it is reasonable to equate the grand potential to the sub - division potential .",

    "it is required to describe the chains as kuhn chains , so that each segment can assume any position in space with respect to the previous segment except for back folding .",
    "since the peo parts of the copolymers stick into the aqueous solution , and the flexibility of the plga and pcl parts do not have a very different chain stiffness chains , we use the kuhn length of peo chains , being @xmath97 nm @xcite , as lattice unit in the sf - scf computations . each unit in terms of r thus equals 0.8 nm . for instance for a peo chain with a molar mass of 6k",

    ", the grand potential does not drop to values near @xmath133 , but start to increase with @xmath108 above some @xmath134 .",
    "this implies that the theory predicts that there is an upper limit in the micelle concentration .",
    "spherical micelles with @xmath135 are unstable and micelles with a cylindrical or lamellar topology are expected instead . in other words , the overall composition of the copolymers is simply too solvophobic to self - assemble in stable spherical micelles .",

    "we have rationalized this limit in a patent application draft @xcite .",

    "the @xmath72-value between plga monomers and water molecules is taken as 1.6 , which causes demixing , but is not that extreme .",
    "indeed the core will dry up with increasing @xmath72-value .",
    "the slight increase of water towards the core is caused by the presence of more plga end segments in the core .",
    "near such end groups it is somewhat less unfavourable to have water molecules .",

    "[ fig:7 ] for the micelle with larger copolymers we observe the density profile inside the core of the micelle varies more strongly . also the size of the micelles is smaller as can be expected ; the hydrophobic chains are only 30 segments long , so the cores are smaller , and the stabilizing peo chains on the outside are smaller as well . as a rough estimation one might speculate that @xmath108 is half of the value for micelles composed of plga@xmath117peo@xmath117plga@xmath117 micelles ( @xmath146 ) .",

    "we choose plga ( homopolymer ) chains with a molar mass of 20k , corresponding to 180 segments , as the guest molecules .",
    "these will be fairly insoluble in the aqueous bulk and will prefer to be encapsulated in the core of the micelle because of the plga environment .",

    "[ fig:7 ] is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] .",
    "the number of copolymers per micelle now increased from 237 to 337 and the diameter increases from 45 to 51 nm .",
    "as expected we see that , whereas the plga monomer concentration in the core is constant , the free plga is more concentrated close to the centre of the micelle and the plga monomers connected to the triblocks concentrate in the outer core region .",
    "not shown is the finding that the influence of molar mass of the free plga is nearly imperceptible .",
    "sf - scf obviously enables to study encapsulation effects and efficiencies .",
    "once all flory - huggins @xmath72-parameters are known between any drug molecule , the polymer segments and the solvent , sf - scf allows studying encapsulation equilibriums .",
    "this computation inspired us to make the study leading to the results that will be presented in the companion publication @xcite .",
    "we have also studied triblocks with the hydrophobic polymer pcl , replacing plga . in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] we have plotted sf - scf results for a micelle composed of pcl@xmath150peo@xmath145pcl@xmath150 triblock copolymers using 1.9k - 3k - 1.9k pcl - peo - pcl triblocks ( see again table [ tab:9 ] for the @xmath72-parameters used ) . for this micelle",
    "we find it consists of 155 copolymers per micelle ( table [ tab:10 ] ) .",
    "since the @xmath72-parameter is estimated to be substantially larger ( 3.0 ) the core now hardly contains water and can merely be viewed upon as a pcl melt environment . in the corona the peo again goes through a maximum volume fraction that now reaches a maximum value of nearly 50 vol% of peo segments .",
    "it seems the peo segments here screen the hydrophobic core more strongly .",
    "they interact as a mediator between water and the very hydrophobic core and in this case the peak is more sharp due to a more hydrophobic core environment .",
    "this might also have consequences for drug release ; once the drugs leave the hydrophobic core the drugs need to pass the peo barrier before they are released from the micelle .    .",
    "the micelle consists of pcl@xmath150peo@xmath145pcl@xmath150 triblock copolymers.,width=302 ]    in summary , we have shown that the sf - scf theory may be used as a tool to unravel the structure - function relationship between copolymer composition and micellar size and morphology , also for situations that the resulting micelles are structurally quenched . hence , using sf - scf predictions allow for more efficient experimentation . as discussed more thoroughly in the companion publication @xcite , by utilizing this approach we were able to prepare nanosized particles consisting of plga - peo - plga ( 7.5 - 6 - 7.5 and 3.75 - 3 - 3.75 ) or pcl - peo - pcl ( 1.9 - 3 - 1.9 ) block copolymers in which ( several ) hydrophobic compounds can be encapsulated .",
    "one of the reasons to do this is that ostwald ripening was minimized .",
    "stabilization of micelles by block copolymers prevents particle aggregation , but the stabilizing polymer layer is open enough to allow solute mass transfer . in order to prevent / minimize solute transfer it is desired to tune the particle core composition to prevent this mass transfer .",
    "additionally , the solubility of the encapsulated compound can be decreased by antisolvent addition to the bulk resulting in a significant slow down of ostwald ripening .",
    "the extremely low solubility of the used triblock copolymers limits copolymer exchange between micelle and bulk again minimizing solute mass transfer and slowing down ostwald ripening .",
    "there is no need to use surfactant in this process , conventional nanoprecipitation processes need an excess of surfactant , mostly very water soluble with relative high cmc s . since we incorporated the surfactant function in the polymer backbone no exchange of adsorbed and free surfactant",
    "is needed for stable suspensions .",
    "this also avoids washing the nanoparticle suspension to remove excess of free surfactant used in the process and limits ostwald ripening .",
    "we were able to synthesize different kinds of triblock copolymers allowing simultaneous tuning of the size and loading .",
    "when performing the nanoprecipitation process there is hardly an influence of temperature and triblock copolymer molar mass polydispersity .",
    "however , using these micelles in electrolytes , e.g. in vivo , care must be taken to avoid destabilization of the micelles due to electrostatic interactions .",
    "non reported data shows that it is feasible to perform the nanoprecipitation process , using the mentioned triblock copolymers , in different electrolytes at different ph s and that the suspension stays stable in time .",
    "in summary , we have shown that sf - scf predictions provide an accurate prediction of structural properties of micelles processed via nanoprecipitation and composed of pcl - peo - pcl and plga - peo - plga copolymers .",
    "the hydrodynamic size that follows from these computations matches surprisingly well with the measured particle sizes from dynamic light scattering . from the computations it follows that the size of the nanoparticles is determined by the number - averaged molar mass of the block copolymers",
    "; polydispersity hardly affects the size of the micelles .",
    "we may speculate about reasons why an equilibrium theory can be used for an intrinsically off - equilibrium micelle formation process .",
    "one must realize that in the micelle formation procedure the solvent quality goes from a good solvent to a selective solvent .",
    "we may suggest that this solvent exchange is sufficiently slow so that chains can respond for some time to a local equilibrium , which we can mimic using some effective ( intermediate ) parameters .",
    "when the solvent quality subsequently becomes more extreme , the cores solidifies and the aggregation number is quenched .",
    "the latter may occur relatively suddenly in the process , so that the chains effectively can not respond to these more selective solvent conditions .",
    "the prediction of the aggregation number corresponding to the quench point is apparently possible using a set of effective interaction parameters . for given aggregation number",
    ", the theory can then predict accurate radial distribution functions and corresponding hydrodynamic sizes .",
    "modifications of the nanoprecipitation method , e.g. by changing the initial solvent quality and/or the exchange time for the solvent going from good to selective , is expected to have an influence on the best values for the interaction parameters that should be used in subsequent scf modeling . however , once calibrated for given process conditions , one can proceed also for these new conditions to predict by the scf theory a value for the aggregation number , the hydrodynamic size and loading capacities .",
