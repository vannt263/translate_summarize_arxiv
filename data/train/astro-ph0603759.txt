    "active galactic nuclei ( agns)seyfert galaxies and quasars  are characterized by non - thermal continuum emission over almost the whole electromagnetic spectrum from their nuclei and prominent emission lines in the ultraviolet and the optical .",
    "the overall spectral energy distribution ( sed ) can be described as an underlying power law of the form @xmath12 interspersed with bumps and dips .",
    "the agns can be classified into two types according to their emission spectrum : type  1 agns show both broad emission lines with full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of a few thousand @xmath13 and narrow emission lines of a few hundred @xmath13 , while type  2 agns show only narrow emission lines . permitted and semi - forbidden lines are seen with both broad and narrow profiles , while forbidden lines are seen only with narrow profiles .",
    "it was recognized at the end of 1970s ( e.g. , osterbrock 1978 ) that such a split might be an orientation effect involving obscuration of the broad - line region ( blr ) . according to unification models , all agns have intrinsically the same physical structure , but in type  2s the blr and continuum emission region are obscured by a presumed dusty torus located somewhere between the blr and the narrow line region ( nlr ) .",
    "it seems that the division of agns into type  1 and type  2 is well - defined and the evidence for unification schemes is compelling ( cf , antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "interestingly , almost at the same time when the unified models were first brought forward , it was found that two objects , mrk 359 ( davidson & kinman 1978 ) and mrk 42 ( koski 1978 ; phillips 1978 ) , have all the spectral properties of a typical type  1 agn , except that the  broad permitted lines \" are comparable in width to the forbidden lines as in the case of type  2 agns .",
    "some other unusually narrow  broad line emitters \" ( e.g. , mrk 493 and mrk 783 , osterbrock & dahari 1983 ) were identified in the following years .",
    "this intriguing mixture of features makes this  peculiar \" group of agns very interesting .",
    "osterbrock & pogge ( 1985 , hereafter op85 ) denoted these objects as narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) .",
    "their original classification included the following two empirical and somewhat subjective criteria : 1 ) the balmer lines are only slightly broader than forbidden lines ; and 2 ) the line ratio @xmath14\\lambda5007/h\\beta<3 $ ] ; but exceptions are allowed when strong high - ionization iron lines , such as [ fevii]@xmath15 and [ fex]@xmath16 are present , which are seldom seen in type  2 agns . in his spectropolarimetric study of nls1s , goodrich ( 1989 ) treated them as an extension of normal broad - line seyfert  1s ( hereafter bls1s ) to lower fwhm of permitted lines and quantified the first criterion of op85 with @xmath17 .",
    "apart from the unusually narrow balmer lines , nls1s often show the strong permitted feii emission lines in their optical and ultraviolet spectra ; they also show some other extreme properties , such as a steep soft x - ray spectrum , rapid x - ray variability , dense line - emitting gas , and a commonly blue shifted uv line profile ( boller et al .",
    "1996 ; leighly 1999 ; aoki & yoshida 1999 ; wills et al .  1999 ;",
    "leighly 2000 ) .",
    "in fact , these properties are extensions of the following correlations between various observables and the @xmath18 line width ( boroson & green 1992 ; laor et al .",
    "1994 ; wang , brinkmann , & bergeron 1996 ; xu et al . 2003 ) : the narrower the @xmath18 line , the steeper the x - ray spectrum , the stronger the @xmath18 blue wings , the faster the x - ray variation , the stronger the optical feii emission , the weaker the [ oiii ] lines , and the denser the blr clouds .",
    "these form the so - called eigenvector 1 ( e1 , boroson & green 1992 ; sulentic et al .",
    "e1 is taken as the strongest and most far - reaching type  1 agn unification yet discovered ( e.g. , marziani et al .",
    "2001 ) , which incorporates the geometry , kinematics , and physical condition of the central regions in agns .",
    "its underlying physical driver is related to either the basic physical parameters of the black hole accretion disk such as the black hole mass and accretion rate , or geometrical parameters such as the viewing angle ( boroson & green 1992 ; boller et al .",
    "1996 ; wang , brinkmann , & bergeron 1996 ; laor et al .  1997 ; sulentic et al .  2000 ; marziani et al .  2001 ) .",
    "since nls1s lie at the extreme negative end of e1 , they may well occupy some extreme regions in the parameter space of some primary physical parameters , whatever they are .",
    "we can , therefore , use the unusualness of nls1s to test the viability of the different agn models .",
    "however , some of the basic properties of nls1s remain unclear even though it has been two decades since their first identification .",
    "we summarize these issues under the following two headings .",

    ", for the nls1s , which have on average steeper photon    indices , the same correlation shows a larger dispersion .",
    "it is still    not known whether the flatness of the x - ray spectra of some nls1s is    intrinsic or is due to internal absorption .",

    "it is unclear whether this correlation should be included in    e1 .",
    "3 ) rodrguez - ardila et al .  (",
    "2000 ) claimed that the emission line    ratio of the narrow line region ( nlr ) , [ oiii]/h@xmath7 , is    in the range of @xmath19 for nls1s , significantly less    than the values @xmath1 , typical of normal agns , while    vvg01 did not find any difference between the two types .",
    "virgin territories : : :    compared to the well studied emission line and x - ray properties of    nls1s , little or no attention has been given to 1 ) their broad - band    continuum properties ; 2 ) the relationship between the nls1 phenomena    and the evolution of the host galaxies ; 3 ) the type  2 counterparts of    nls1s predicted by agn unification models ; and 4 ) their spectral    variability .    to resolve the controversies and to seek new insights",
    ", it would be helpful to have a large - size homogeneous sample of optically selected nls1s with accurately measured parameters of both narrow and broad lines . the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york et al .",
    "2000 ) is expected to be able to provide such nls1 samples resulting from well - defined selection criteria that are large enough for serious statistical studies ; furthermore , it is expected that potentially peculiar and interesting objects will be identified and studied with follow - up observations . the first attempt in this direction",
    "was made by williams , pogge , & mathur ( 2002 , hereafter wpm02 ) who compiled a sample of nls1s from the sdss early data release ( edr , stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) , which comprised 150 objects . with a roughly 10-fold increase in size over the edr",
    ", the presently available sdss spectroscopic data can be expected to yield many more nls1s for the study .",
    "we carried out a systematic search for nls1s from the spectroscopic sample of the sloan digital sky survey data release 3 ( sdss dr3 , abazajian et al .",
    "2005 ) . in order to obtain from sdss spectra accurate and reliable line widths that are essential for the selection and the follow - on analysis",
    ", we carefully fitted emission lines , agn continuum and starlight in a self - consistent manner . as a result",
    ", we now have a uniform sample comprising as many as 2  011 nls1s .",
    "the accurately measured emission - line parameters and hence the selection of sample objects are an improvement on wpm02 , rendering our sample less affected by selection biases compared to wpm02 .",
    "this paper is the first of a series which reports on our ongoing project for extensive studies of nls1s by fully exploring the potential of this large - size sample . here",
    "we present the object catalog , which will be kept updated as new sdss data are further available ; also presented are some preliminary statistical results on the sample as a whole .",
    "we shall attempt to address some of the issues raised above in forthcoming papers .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in the next section , we describe in detail the methods we used to process all the low redshift qsos and galaxies in the sdss dr3 .",
    "the sample selection is described in  3 .",
    "the properties of the sample are discussed in  4 , including a statistical analysis of the emission lines and remarks on potentially interesting individuals .",
    "we explore the black hole ",
    "bulge relation for nls1s in  5 .",
    "our main results are summarized in the last section , followed by prospects of future work . a @xmath20-dominated cosmology with @xmath21 , @xmath22 0.3 and @xmath23 0.7 is assumed throughout the paper .",
    "our nls1s were selected from the sdss dr3 catalogs that are classified as  galaxy \" or",
    " qso \" by the sdss spectroscopic pipeline . only objects with a redshift @xmath24 were considered to ensure that the @xmath18 and [ oiii ] emission lines would fall within the wavelength coverage of the sdss spectrograph ( details of sdss spectroscopy can be found in stoughton et al.2002 ) .",
    "the spectra of the resulting 387 483 extragalactic objects ( 12 824  qsos \" and 374 659  galaxies \" ) were first corrected for the galactic extinction using the extinction curve of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and then shifted back to their rest frames using the redshifts provided by the sdss pipeline .    _ contamination from stellar light : _ the fibers that feed the sdss spectrograph subtend a diameter of @xmath25 on the sky , which corresponds to @xmath26 at @xmath27 .",
    "agn spectra taken through such a fixed aperture may include significant light from the host galaxies , as exhibited in the composite spectra of sdss quasars ( vanden berk et al .",
    "careful removal of the starlight is essential for reliable measurement of the emission lines , and hence correct identifications of nls1s from the huge sdss data .",
    "actually , the starlight  contamination \" provides valuable information about the host galaxies , which is of interest in itself . for this and other purposes ,",
    "we have developed a technique of properly modeling the stellar component ( see lu et al .",
    "2006 for details of the method ) .",
    "this method decomposes the sdss spectra of active galaxies into stellar and non - stellar nuclear components , provided that the two components are comparable in strength . a description of this method is given in  [ sect : starlight ] .",
    "_ broad - line and narrow - line decomposition : _ the balmer emission lines of nls1s may include significant contribution from narrow - line components ( vvg01 ; rodrguez - ardila et al",
    ".  2000 ) . in the selection of nls1s based on the line s fwhm , it is therefore more appropriate to use the _ broad _ component rather than the total emission line , as was done in wpm02",
    "moreover , the de - blended narrow components have interest of their own for the study of the nlr properties in nls1s .",
    "we therefore performed emission - line decomposition in the analysis .",
    "for reliable line decomposition , good spectral quality is required in terms of both s / n ratio and spectral resolution .",
    "rodrguez - ardila et al .  ( 2000 ) demonstrated that spectra with a high s / n ratio ( the exact value is unclear but likely to be around 30/pixel ) and a moderate resolution ( @xmath28 fwhm at @xmath29 ) are sufficient for the decomposition of the permitted emission - lines in nls1s . in comparison ,",
    "the sdss spectra used in this work have a somewhat lower s / n on average but better resolution ( estimated to be @xmath30 fwhm at @xmath29 , cf .",
    "greene & ho 2005 ) ; the effect of the latter compensates the effect of the former .",
    "spectral decomposition was also carried out in vvg01 , in which the spectral resolution ( @xmath31 ) was actually a little bit worse than that of the sdss spectra .",
    "we therefore anticipate that the spectral quality of the sdss data is adequate for our purposes , at least for the majority of objects .",
    "a detailed account of spectral - line fitting is presented in ",
    "[ sect : linefit ] .",
    "_ spectral fitting procedure : _ in the processing of this large data set we employed a two - step iteration procedure , which is outlined below and detailed in the following two subsections .",
    "the continua of the broad emission - line agn candidates were first decomposed into starlight and nuclear components .",
    "beforehand , two kinds of spectral regions had been masked out : firstly , bad pixels as flagged by the sdss pipeline ; secondly , the wavelength ranges which may be seriously affected by prominent emission lines characteristic of qso spectra . to determine the latter ,",
    "the composite sdss qso spectrum ( vanden berk et al .  2001 ) was used during the first iteration .",
    "a pseudo - continuum was fitted and subtracted , which was chosen as a non - negative linear combination of properly generated templates taking into account the contribution from both starlight and nucleus (  [ sect : starlight ] ) .",
    "the leftover emission - line spectrum was fitted with gaussian and/or lorentzian profiles , separating broad and narrow line components (  [ sect : linefit ] ) . then the _ measured _",
    "emission line spectrum was used to replace the composite sdss spectrum in the second iteration .",
    "this procedure was reiterated until the fitted parameters of both the continuum and the emission - line spectrum converged to an acceptable accuracy .",
    "we modeled the pseudo - continuum of the 387 483 sdss galaxies and qsos with 2 to 4 components @xmath32\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the observed spectrum .",
    "@xmath34 represents the starlight component modeled by our 6 synthesized galaxy templates , which had been built up from the spectral template library of simple stellar populations ( ssps ) of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 , hereafter , bc03 ) using our new method based on the ensemble learning independent component analysis ( el - ica ) algorithm .",
    "the merits of these galaxy templates are that , firstly , their physical meanings are clear ; secondly , in most cases , an over - fit to the spectra can be avoided because the most prominent features of the bc03 ssp library are embodied to the greatest extent in only 6 non - negative independent components ( ics ) .",
    "the details of the galaxy templates and their applications are presented in lu et al .",
    "@xmath35 was broadened by convolving with a gaussian of width @xmath9 to match the stellar velocity dispersion of the host galaxy .",
    "the un - reddened nuclear continuum is assumed to be @xmath36 as given in francis ( 1996 ) .",
    "@xmath37 denotes the optical feii templates of vron - cetty et al .",
    "( 2004 ) with the width fixed to that of the broad component of @xmath18 .",

    "the fitting was performed by minimizing the @xmath42 with @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath9 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 being non - negative free parameters .    to reduce the amount of computation , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath47 and @xmath48",
    "were fixed at zero during the first iteration .",
    "then the modeled continuum was subtracted from the observed spectrum and the emission line parameters were measured in the way described in  [ sect : linefit ] .",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath44 were set to be free parameters when the continuum was fitted the second time . for those objects in which the @xmath18 broad emission line is reliably detected ( at the @xmath49 confidence level ) ,",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath48 were also set free , and the width of the feii multiplets was fixed to that of the @xmath18 broad component .",
    "this time the wavelength ranges of the emission lines to be masked out were determined using the _ measured _ line parameters .",
    "the iteration continued until the fitted parameters of both the modeled stellar spectrum and the emission - line spectrum converged to an acceptable accuracy .",
    "representative examples of the el - ica starlight  nucleus decomposition are shown in figure[f1 ] .",
    "the emission - line fitting procedure adopted here is similar to that used in dong et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , but with some modifications in the codes to improve the accuracy of the measurement of the broad components of h@xmath7 and h@xmath50 , as described in the following .",
    "the emission lines are decomposed into a broad and a narrow component wherever the latter contributes non - negligibly .",
    "the [ nii ] doublet are separated from h@xmath50 .",
    "all narrow emission lines , except the [ oiii ] doublet , were fitted with a single gaussian because these lines are often quite weak in nls1s and the s / n is not high for most objects .",
    "the [ oiii ] doublet were fitted either with a single gaussian if the profile is symmetrical or of low s / n , or with a double gaussian otherwise .",
    "the flux ratios of the [ oiii ] and [ nii ] doublets were fixed at their theoretical values . the profile and redshift of the h@xmath50 narrow component",
    "were assumed to be the same as those of the [ nii ] and [ sii ] doublets ; this approach is often adopted in separating the narrow and broad components in the h@xmath50+[nii]+[sii ] regime ( e.g. , ho et al .  1997 ; vvg01 ; and dong et al .",
    "this assumption can be tested using type  2 agns , where narrow emission lines can be measured much more easily .",
    "here we carried out such a test using a sample of @xmath51 type  2 agns with high s / n spectra from sdss .",
    "figure[f2 ] shows fwhm[nii ] ( upper left panel ) and fwhm[sii ] ( upper right panel ) against fwhm(h@xmath50 ) .",
    "it can be seen that both fwhm[nii ] and fwhm[sii ] are statistically well consistent with fwhm(h@xmath50 ) . for this type  2 agn sample ,",
    "then , we made a second fit after tying together the profiles and redshifts of h@xmath50 , [ nii]@xmath52 , and [ sii]@xmath53 .",
    "the fitted line width was compared with that of h@xmath7 , and a good agreement was found ( figure[f2 ] lower left panel ) .",
    "fwhm(h@xmath7 ) was also found to be well correlated with fwhm[oiii ] , though the scatter is much larger than in the fwhm(h@xmath7)fwhm[nii ] correlation .",
    "we therefore consider it a good approximation to tie the profile and redshift of the narrow component of h@xmath7in the case of weak lines , either narrow or broad  to the fitted values of h@xmath50+[nii ] or [ oiii ] .",
    "we refer to these schemes as ",
    "h@xmath50 to h@xmath7 \" and  [ oiii ] to h@xmath7 \" , respectively .    in the first place ,",
    "each of the forbidden and permitted lines was fitted with a single gaussian .",
    "objects were assigned as candidates of broad emission - line agns if their balmer emission line(s ) were significantly broader than the forbidden lines or their feii multiplets were detected at the @xmath54 confidence level .",
    "the spectra of more than 6  000 candidates from the sdss  galaxy \" catalog were visually inspected and 1  926 turned out to be broad line agns .",
    "these , together with 12  824 objects with @xmath55 in the sdss  qso \" catalog , were carried over into the second iteration stage .",
    "after the continuum was subtracted , the h@xmath50 and h@xmath7 emission lines were fitted with two gaussians , one for the narrow and one for the broad component . as mentioned above , the width and redshift of the narrow component of h@xmath50",
    "were tied to those of the [ nii ] and [ sii ] doublets ; and for the narrow component of h@xmath7 , the  h@xmath50 to h@xmath7 \" ( for @xmath56 ) or  [ oiii ] to h@xmath7 \" ( for @xmath57 ) schemes were adopted . the objects were reserved whose broad component(s ) of h@xmath50 or h@xmath7 were detected at the @xmath58 level with the fwhm less than @xmath59 .",
    "all the rejected objects were double - checked for confirmation by visual inspection to ensure that no true nls1s were missed ( actually such checks were made throughout the whole selection process whenever an object was to be rejected ) .",
    "we also rejected at this stage the narrow emission line galaxies that were mis - classified as  qsos \" by the sdss pipeline . at the stage of the third iteration ,",
    "the broad components of h@xmath50 and h@xmath7 were fitted with a lorentzian profile , while the narrow lines were fitted in the same way as in the second iteration .",
    "only those having fwhm(h@xmath50 ) or fwhm(h@xmath7 ) less than 2  500kms@xmath60 were carried over into the last iteration stage .",
    "the emission lines were then fitted using one of the following four schemes in order of decreasing preference : 1 ) the broad and narrow components of h@xmath7 are de - blended freely ; 2 ) the  h@xmath50 to h@xmath7 \" scheme ; 3 ) the  [ oiii ] to h@xmath7 \" scheme ; and 4 ) h@xmath50 and h@xmath7 lines are fitted with a single lorentzian ( for objects having no isolated narrow emission line detected or having too noisy spectra ) .",
    "the fitting results were visually inspected before acceptance .",
    "only 42 objects could not be fitted satisfactorily by using the above procedure . among those exceptions ,",
    "the majority have the broad components of h@xmath50 or h@xmath7 too narrow to separate from the narrow components ; the remaining have their redshifts incorrectly assigned by the sdss pipeline .",
    "their spectra were fitted manually .",
    "figure[f3 ] shows a few examples of emission - line decomposition in the h@xmath50 and h@xmath7 wavelength ranges .",
    "based on the emission line parameters measured , we compiled our nls1 sample .",
    "the only criterion we adopted for identifying a nls1 galaxy is : the  broad \" component of h@xmath7 or h@xmath50 is detected ( at the @xmath58 confidence level ) and is narrower than @xmath61 in fwhm .",
    "this criterion resulted in 2  011 nls1 candidates , whose main spectral parameters are summarized in table[tbl-1 ] .",
    "it is noticeable that our selection criterion is somewhat different from the `` conventional '' nls1 definition ( see the introduction ) in two aspects : firstly , the line width cut - off of @xmath61 is slightly higher than the commonly used @xmath62 ; secondly , we did not restrict ourselves to objects with @xmath14/h\\beta<3 $ ] .",
    "these modifications were made based on the following considerations : ( 1 ) the line width distribution for the balmer lines reveals a rather smooth transition between nls1s and bls1s , which means that any dividing line is somewhat arbitrary and ` operational ' . besides",
    ", different line profiles were used by the different authors ( see vvg01 and the references therein ) , and sometimes the narrow component was not taken into account properly ( e.g. , wpm02 ) , resulting in underestimation of the line width ( see  3.2 ) . as can be seen from figure[f4 ] ( upper left panels ) , typical relative errors of the broad components of h@xmath7 and h@xmath50 are 6% and 3% , respectively . by relaxing the fwhm cut - off in h@xmath7 or",
    "h@xmath50 up to @xmath61 , we could cover most of the bona fide nls1s with low spectral quality , at the expense of introducing a few spurious ones though .",
    "imposing the stricter criterion of fwhm=@xmath62 would reduce the sample size to 1  885 objects .",
    "( 2 ) the restriction of @xmath14/h\\beta<3 $ ] was originally introduced to separate nls1s from seyfert2s where the resolution and/or s / n of the observed spectra were too low to do so .",
    "this is not the case for at least the majority of objects in our study , however , as discussed in ",
    "[ sect : overview ] .",
    "consequently , this criterion becomes no long necessary .",
    "in fact , there is only one object ( sdssj104755.93 + 073951.2 , see figure[f5 ] upper panels ) that fails to meet this restriction .",
    "as a serendipitous finding , one object ( sdss  j113323.97 + 550415.8 ) having the prominent , narrow  broad \" balmer emission lines [ @xmath63 and @xmath64 characteristic of nls1 was actually a type  2 supernova .",
    "its spectrum and sdss image are shown in figure[f5 ] ( lower panel ) .",
    "the object is located at the edge of the nearby blue compact galaxy ugca 239 ( sdss  j113323.46 + 550420.6 ) and has the same redshift as the galaxy .",
    "it was noticed because its brightness decreased by @xmath65 magnitudes within less than one - year between the photometric and spectroscopic observations .",
    "its disappearance from our later imaging observation of ugca 239 using the 2.16 m telescope of beijing observatory in january , 2005 confirmed its supernova nature .",
    "accordingly we removed this object from our nls1 sample .",
    "our nls1s were drawn from a well - defined parent population of broad emission - line agns comprising candidates of both qsos ( richards et al .",
    "2002 ) and galaxies ( strauss et al .",
    "2002 and eisenstein et al.2001 ) .",
    "considering the fact that the vast majority of the sample were selected based on the optical selection criteria , we regard the sample simply as an optically selected sample .",
    "the emission - line parameters were measured with high accuracy by precise subtraction of the stellar and nuclear continuum and proper decomposition of the permitted emission - lines into a narrow and a broad component .",
    "since the broad components of h@xmath50 and h@xmath7 were measured separately , we could check our emission - line fitting algorithm by comparing the two measurements .",
    "figure[f4 ] which plots fwhm(h@xmath50 ) against fwhm(h@xmath7 ) confirms the previously known correlation between the two .",
    "our linear fit , @xmath66 , is consistent with the @xmath67 found by eracleous & halpern ( 1994 ) , and the @xmath68 deviation about @xmath69 is only slightly larger than typical measuring errors ( see the inset panel ) .",
    "we also compared the fluxes of the broad components of h@xmath50 and h@xmath7 and found @xmath70 and a dispersion of @xmath71 in the h@xmath50 to h@xmath7 ratio ( figure[f6 ] ) .",
    "the good agreement between the independent measurements of the broad h@xmath50 and h@xmath7 components indicates that our emission - line fitting algorithm should be accurate and reliable .",
    "the method for identifying nls1s we used in this work is largely different from that used in wpm02 ; moreover , the wpm02 sample was drawn merely from the  qso \" database of the sdss early data release ( edr ) .",
    "it would therefore be interesting to compare our sample with that of wpm02 .",
    "we found that the 150 nls1 candidates in the wpm02 sample are all included in our parent sample of broad emission - line agns .",
    "master sample .",
    "our measured fwhm(h@xmath7 ) are compared with those in wpm02 in the lower left panel of figure[f4 ] . for those objects in which the narrow component of h@xmath7 is negligible",
    ", we found excellent agreement between the two measurements .",
    "however , for about 1/3 of the objects , our measurements of fwhm(h@xmath7 ) are significantly larger than theirs .",
    "going through these objects by visual inspection of their spectra revealed that the discrepancy is due to the non - negligible contribution of the h@xmath7 narrow component , which was not taken into account in wpm02 . to demonstrate this effect we plot in figure[f4 ] ( lower right panel ) the fwhm(h@xmath7 ) ratio of our measurements to theirs against the height ratio of the narrow to broad component of h@xmath7 , taken as an indicator of the relative strength of the narrow component .",
    "it can be seen that the measured fwhm(h@xmath7 ) values in wpm02 start to deviate from ours when the narrow component becomes non - negligible , that the deviation gets worse as the narrow component increases , to reach a factor of 2 or more when the narrow component surpasses the broad component in height .    as a result ,",
    "5 objects in the wpm02 sample were excluded from our nls1 sample because their fwhms of the h@xmath7 broad component actually exceeded our criterion of @xmath61 .",
    "their de - blended components of h@xmath7 and h@xmath50 resulting from our analysis are shown in figure[f7 ] .",
    "on the other hand , our sample includes 86 objects from the edr database that were not included in the wpm02 sample . of these , only 17 fall within the range defined by the differing cutoffs , @xmath72 , while most of these because they were assigned by wpm02 to a separate category , seyfert 1.5 , by virtue of their prominent narrow components of the balmer emission - lines .",
    "we included these simply because their broad components had fwhm(h@xmath50 ) or fwhm(h@xmath7 ) that satisfied our cut - off criterion .",
    "we argue that the nature of these objects ( see figure [ f8 ] for some examples ) should not be much different from classic nls1s , and there seem to be no particular reasons to exclude them based merely on the prominence of their narrow emission - lines .",
    "in addition , thanks to our starlight  nucleus decomposition and automated spectral fitting algorithm , our sample includes 13 nls1s drawn from the edr _ galaxy _ database , which was not considered in wpm02 at all ; in fact , a total of 138 nls1s were culled from the galaxy catalog from the sdss dr3 database .",
    "the rest few objects not included in the wpm02 sample have either low spectral quality or large uncertainties in the measured spectral parameters .",
    "we accordingly believe that our nls1 sample has a greater degree of completeness than the wpm02 sample .",
    "the following caveats should be noted : given the quality @xmath73 typical of the sdss spectra for low redshift broad - line agns ( blagns ) , objects with very narrow  broad \" permitted emission lines could not be effectively identified unless the feii multiplets were sufficiently strong .",
    "also , nls1s with large extinction may have been missed out .",
    "observations in multi - wavebands , such as the hard x - ray band , are needed to identify such objects .",
    "our sample of nls1s is more than ten times the size of wpm02 , while equally or even more complete and uniform . in this section",
    "we present some basic properties of the nls1 population , taking advantage of this unprecedented sample size .",
    "the nls1s as a whole make up 14% of all the broad emission - line agns .",
    "this fraction is consistent with the often quoted value of 15% , first suggested by osterbrock ( 1988 ) and later confirmed by wpm02 .",
    "figure[f9 ] shows the distribution of nls1s and  normal \" blagns in redshift and nuclear luminosity ( as represented by the g-band absolute psf magnitude ) , as well as the nls1 fraction within overall blagns .",
    "the nls1 fraction appears to increase slightly up to a redshift of 0.45 , after which it decreases dramatically toward high redshift .",
    "this is actually not a reflection of the cosmic evolution of the nls1 fraction but is rather one of its dependence on the nuclear luminosity ( as seen in figure[f9 ] ) , which is strongly correlated with redshift for a flux - limited sample .    the fast decrease of the nls1 fraction with increasing nuclear luminosity in the high luminosity range results actually from the emission line width  luminosity relation , which is discussed below in  [ sect : lum - width ] .",
    "the strong positive correlation of the nls1 fraction with luminosity in the low luminosity range @xmath74 is unexpected .",
    "the fraction peaks at @xmath75 , where nls1s make up about @xmath76 of all sdss blagns ; this peak apparently results from a dip in the luminosity distribution of blagns here ( see figure[f9 ] ) , without there being a corresponding one in that of nls1s .",
    "it is likely that this dip in the blagns distribution is due to selection effects , in the sense that most of low luminosity agns were targeted as  galaxies \" while high luminosity ones as  qsos \" in the sdss .",
    "however , we argue that the peak in the nls1 fraction should be real because objects of both the nls1 and bls1 types were selected according to the same criteria in the sdss . it may be a result of the combination of the local black hole mass function and the distribution of the mass accretion rate .",
    "detailed discussion on this issue is beyond the scope of this paper and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "it was once thought that nls1s are radio quiet ; however , the past few years saw the discovery of about a dozen  radio - loud \" nls1s ( siebert et al .  1999 ; grupe et al .  2000 ; zhou & wang 2002 ; zhou et al .  2003 ) .",
    "two objects among these , both identified from the sdss , are very - radio - loud ( zhou et al . 2003 ; zhou et al . 2005 ) according to the criterion given in sulentic et al .",
    "the incidence of radio - loud nls1s , or the dependence of the fraction of nls1s on the radio properties is of particular interest .",
    "this is because radio - loud nls1s show some extreme characteristics opposite to typical radio - loud agns , e.g.  the extremely steep soft x - ray spectrum in contrast to the usual flat spectrum ( sulentic et al.2000 ) .",
    "this issue can be examined in more detail with our large nls1 sample . out of",
    "the 2 011 nls1s , 142 were detected in the first ( the faint images of the radio sky at 20 cm survey , becker et al .",
    "the radio detection rate is @xmath77 , which is significantly less than what we found for bls1s at @xmath78 .",
    "it is remarkable that all the radio sources of the nls1s detected in the first were unresolved in their radio images .",
    "the distribution of radio - loudness @xmath79 , ( defined as the logarithm of the flux ratio between 1.4 ghz and the optical g - band ) is shown in figure [ f12 ] ( left panels ) respectively for the nls1s and bls1s detected in the first .",
    "compared to the bls1s , the radio - loudness distribution of the nls1s drops much faster beyond @xmath80 , indicating a decline of the nls1 fraction toward high @xmath79 values .",
    "the nls1 fraction is @xmath81 in radio - quiet and radio - intermediate agns ( @xmath82 ) , similar to that from other optically selected samples ; it falls down to @xmath83 in moderately strong radio agns ( @xmath84 ) and further down to @xmath85 in powerful radio agns ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "in particular , we found only 5 very radio - loud nls1s in the whole sample , including the two we reported previously , sdss j084957.98 + 510829.0 and sdss j094857.32 + 002225.5 . these two very radio - loud nls1s show flat spectra and dramatic variability in the radio band , indicating the presence of relativistic jets pointing toward the observer . in fact , sdss j084957.98",
    "+ 510829.0 had been observed before the sdss and was classified as a bl lac object with a wrong redshift ( zhou et al .",
    "2005 and references therein ) .",
    "for the other three sources no significant radio variability was found in time spans of several years between the nvss ( the nrao vla sky survey , condon et al .",
    "1998 ) and the first . with a spectral index of @xmath87 ,",
    "the radio spectrum of the most powerful nls1 , sdss j104732.68 + 472532.1 , is somewhat steeper for a blazar - like source .",
    "the dependence of the nls1 fraction on radio power ( figure[f12 ] , right panels ) is similar to that on the radio - loudness .",
    "a detailed account on the radio properties of nls1s will be presented in a forthcoming paper of the series .",
    "historically , x - ray surveys have been an important tool for the finding and study of nls1s .",
    "for instance , puchnarewicz et al.(1992 ) found that about 50% of their soft x - ray selected agns were nls1s ; a similar result was also obtained by grupe ( 2004 ) .",
    "however , we found that the overall nls1 fraction is only @xmath88 for our optically selected sample .",
    "plotted in figure [ f13 ] ( left panel ) is the dependence of the nls1 fraction on the soft x - ray flux density for the blagns with x - ray counterparts in the rass ; it reveals a strong dependence  the nls1 fraction increases dramatically with the x - ray flux .",
    "at the faint end , the nls1 fraction is @xmath89 , similar to that found in optically - selected blagn samples . at the bright end",
    ", it increases up to @xmath90 , close to that of the soft x - ray selected agn samples reported previously ; this is where the nls1 fractions for optically selected and soft x - ray selected agn are reconciled .",
    "this is not surprising , as above this high flux level optically selected and x - ray selected blagn samples are largely overlapping .",
    "interestingly , we also found a trend of decreasing fraction of nls1s toward high x - ray luminosity ( figure [ f13 ] , right panel ) .",
    "it has been claimed by several authors ( e.g. , miller et al .",
    "1992 ; vvg01 ) that the nuclear luminosity is correlated with the width of the broad balmer emission - lines for blagns , including nls1s .",
    "we plot in figure[f10 ] line luminosity versus line width for h@xmath50 and h@xmath7 , respectively , for our sample .",
    "a weak yet significant correlation is present between the two parameters , despite the small range of the line width ( the spearman coefficient @xmath91 for fwhm(h@xmath7 ) and l(h@xmath7 ) , and @xmath92 for fwhm(h@xmath50 ) and l(h@xmath50 ) , corresponding to chance probabilities much less than 0.1% in both cases ) .",
    "the correlations appear to result from the presence of an upper boundary , as indicated by the dashed lines in figure [ f10 ] .",
    "as will be seen below , the limit is likely caused by the existence of upper limits in the accretion rate in units of the eddington rate .",
    "the central black hole mass can be inferred from the size and the velocity dispersion of the broad emission - line region ( blr ) , @xmath93 provided the blr is virialized .",
    "we can use the width ( fwhm ) of balmer emission - lines to estimate the velocity dispersion of the blr .",
    "supposing all agns have on average the same ionization parameters , the same ionizing spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , the same blr densities and column densities , then we would expect a simple scaling relation between the blr size and the monochromatic luminosity at 5100    ( e.g. , peterson 1993 ) , @xmath94^{0.5}.\\ ] ] hence we can express the virial mass of the central black hole mass as @xmath95^{0.5}~[fwhm(h\\beta~or~h\\alpha)]^2.\\ ] ] for our nls1s , we find that @xmath96 is tightly correlated with the luminosity of h@xmath7 broad component , @xmath97 ( figure [ f11 ] , left panel ) . a linear fit yields , @xmath98 also , assuming that all objects have the same sed , we get @xmath99^{0.840}.\\ ] ] therefore , for objects emitting at the eddington luminosity , @xmath100 a given value of @xmath101 corresponds to a value of @xmath102 , @xmath103^{4.762}.\\ ] ] the exact value of the constant @xmath104 depends on the shape of the ionization continuum , the geometry and physical condition of the blr , and the cosmology adopted .",
    "this correspondence is visualized in figure[f10 ] by the dashed line with the constant @xmath104 so chosen that @xmath105 is a few units of @xmath106 .",
    "it can be seen that most of our nls1s populate below the line .",
    "this result implies that the radiation of the majority of agns including nls1s can not be much higher than a few units of the eddington luminosity .",
    "the correlation between the broad line width and the nuclear luminosity naturally explains the decrease of the nls1 fraction toward high luminosities reported in ",
    "[ sect : fraction ] .",
    "a strong correlation between the luminosity of continuum and [ oiii ] emission line was also found for our nls1s ( see right panel of figure [ f11 ] ) , though not as tight as the @xmath107 correlation .",

    "if the central black hole mass of these type  2 agns can be reliably estimated , one can evaluate their mass accretion rate and search for type  2 counterparts of nls1s in those objects with high eddington ratios @xmath109 .",
    "though not a defining property , nls1s usually show strong optical feii emission lines . out of the 2 011 nls1s ,",
    "the feii multiplets were detected in 1 787 objects at the @xmath110 level .",
    "for the rest the sdss spectra were too noisy to yield reliable measurements and the @xmath111 upper limits were calculated ( see table[tbl-1 ] ) .",

    "the merits of our sample are its large size and uniformity , thanks to which some weak correlations are expected to be identifiable . hence , the sample is suited for an examination of whether the previously known correlations for broad line agns can be extended to smaller line widths .",

    "most of these `` uv - deficient '' spectra can be explained as due to heavy extinction caused by a presumed dusty torus and/or dust lane in the host galaxies . in a few objects , however ,",
    "this unusual spectrum can not be explained by extinction .",
    "for example , the uv dip in the spectrum of sdss j142033.7 + 573900.9 ( figure[f21 ] , upper panel ) can not be entirely accounted for by extinction because the flux ratio of @xmath150 is close to the theoretical value expected for a spectrum free from extinction .    another rare class of nls1s",
    "is concerned with the strength of the feii multiplets .",
    "while the feii emission lines are generally found to be strong in most nls1s , they are very weak , or even undetectable , in some objects with very narrow  broad \" balmer emission lines ( figure[f22 ] ) .",
    "the closest type to these objects is dwarf seyfert 1 galaxies , such as ngc  4395 ( e.g. , filippenko & sargent 1989 ) .",
    "the difference between the two classes lies in that the feii deficient nls1s found here have a relatively high luminosity with respect to the black hole mass , and hence a very high accretion rate .",
    "nls1s and broad absorption line ( bal ) qsos share many common observational properties ( see brandt & gallagher 2000 for a review ) .",

    "on one hand , bal qsos are thought to be otherwise normal qsos seen nearly edge - on according to the popular unification models . on the other hand , there is convincing observational evidence for a small inclination angle for at least some nls1s ( e.g. , zhou et al .",
    "2003 ) . despite many observed properties of bal qsos can be explained by orientation - based unification models , evidence begins to mount that polar outflows do exist , at least in some bal qsos ( zhou et al .",

    "2004 ) measured the bulge stellar velocity dispersion in 14 seyfert 1 galaxies whose smbh masses were determined using the reverberation mapping technique , and showed that the seyfert galaxies followed the same @xmath8 relation as non - active galaxies .",
    "the tight correlations for both normal and active galaxies indicate that the most of the smbh mass was built up in the past by accretion of the same gas that also formed the stars in the host galaxy spheroid .",
    "it is of particular interest as to when and how smbh and the surrounding spheroid of stars settled down at the right masses .",
    "a straightforward approach to investigate the physical link between the smbh growth and the bulge formation is to measure the smbh masses and bulge properties in high redshift agns , and compare them with those in low redshift agns and quiescent galaxies .",

    "one alternative is to study young agns in the local universe .",

    "1997 , mathur 2000 ) . in this sense",
    "nls1s may serve as a surrogate for high redshift agns ( wang & lu 2001 ) .",
    "a direct probe of the @xmath8 relation is practically useful since , in principle , the stellar velocity dispersion of a bulge in nearby active galaxies can be determined more accurately than the bulge luminosity or compactness ( h \" aring & rix 2004 ) . in practice , however , width of the [ oiii ] emission line is often used in stead of stellar velocity dispersion due to observational difficulty of the latter .",
    "using such an approach several groups of authors explored the @xmath8 relation for nls1s recently , with conflicting results : mathur et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , grupe & mathur ( 2004 ) , bian & zhao ( 2004 ) , and botte et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found that nls1s showed a systematically lower @xmath152 ratio than normal broad line agns , while wang & lu ( 2001 ) , wandel ( 2002 ; 2004 ) did not find a clear difference between the two .",
    "the difference may be attributed , at least partly , to the different line widths used by the different authors .",
    "wang & lu ( 2001 ) argued that only symmetric line component can trace the gravitational potential of the bulge and so they used the width of the blue - wing subtracted [ oiii ] line from vvg01 ; in contrast , most others adopted the total [ oiii ] line profile .",
    "it has been shown that the [ oiii ] line profiles in most seyfert galaxies are evidently asymmetric , so signifying complex kinetics of the emission line regions ( vvg01 and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , contamination from the feii emission aggravates the problem , which is especially true for nls1s . to remove all these uncertainties from the study of the smbh - bulge relation",
    ", it is essential to have direct measurements of @xmath9 in stead of the [ oiii ] line width .",
    "the underlying physical justification is clear , since the stellar kinematics is more indicative of the bulge gravitational potential than is the gas in the nlr of the agn . as an attempt along this line , botte et al.(2005 ) obtained the near - infrared spectra of 8 nls1s with a moderately high resolution of @xmath153 per pixel , and measured directly the stellar velocity dispersions using the caii@xmath154 8498,8542,8662 absorption triplet .",
    "they found that @xmath155}\\gtrsim \\sigma_{*}$ ] for 8 of the 10 nls1s with @xmath9 available so far , and demonstrated that the nls1s follow the same @xmath8 relation as normal broad line agns and non - active galaxies .",
    "however , the sample of botte et al .",
    "( 2005 ) is too small to give conclusive results , as was warned by the authors themselves . a large nls1 sample with properly measured @xmath9 is utterly needed .    as discussed above in ",
    "[ sect : starlight ] , in the process of decomposing the stellar and nuclear components in nls1s , @xmath9 can be obtained automatically .",
    "though the resolution and s / n ratio of the sdss spectra are not perfect for exploring the @xmath8 relation in nls1s , the present sample is so large as to render it sensitive for identifying any weak trend .",
    "apart from the spectral resolution and signal - to - noise ratio , the measurement uncertainty of @xmath9 is also strongly dependent on the relative contribution of the stellar light .",
    "we found that @xmath9 could be measured with acceptable errors for spectra with a median signal - to - noise ratio @xmath156 and a relative contribution of starlight more than 40% of the total flux at 5100 .",
    "a small number of objects have measured @xmath9 values as small as @xmath157 , which is actually beyond the resolution of the sdss ; they were discarded from the analysis . adopting these criteria yielded 308 objects with , we believe , reasonably well determined @xmath9",
    "; they formed the subsample which we used to test the black hole ",
    "bulge relation for nls1s .",
    "figure[f24 ] plots , for this subsample , the estimated @xmath10 versus @xmath9 , with the @xmath10 determined using the line width  luminosity mass scaling relation ( e.g. , kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ; mclure & jarvis 2002 ; dietrich & hamann 2004 ) , @xmath158 the well known @xmath10@xmath9 relation for normal galaxies , as parameterized by tremaine et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , @xmath159 is marked in the plot by the dashed line .",
    "a correlation is clearly present , which follows the trend of the @xmath10@xmath9 relation for galaxies ( the spearman correlation coefficient r=0.27 giving a chance probability of @xmath160 ) .",
    "meanwhile , the data points of nls1s show a systematic downward shift relative to the relation for galaxies as defined in equation [ eq5 ] , with the bulk of the subsample ( @xmath161 ) located below the dashed line .",
    "the results indicate that , firstly , the correlation between @xmath10 and @xmath9 remains valid for nls1s ; and secondly , the smbhs in nls1s are underage and their growth lags behind the formation of the bulges , as suggested by e.g. , mathur et al .",
    "we stress that our results are actually consistent with botte et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ; their much smaller sample prevented the authors from drawing the same conclusion .",
    "in fact , only 2 of the 10 nls1s in their sample are located above the @xmath10@xmath9 line for normal galaxies and normal agns .",
    "caution should be exercised when accepting the above results , considering that the derived @xmath9 may be affected by contamination by the rotation of the galactic disk .",
    "this issue presents a matter of concern here since , for nls1s at typical redshifts in our sample , the fiber aperture would cover the whole galactic disk . for a further examination of the reality of the @xmath8 relation obtained above , we tried to minimize the contamination effect of the galactic disk rotation .",
    "we visually inspected the sdss images of nls1s at redshifts @xmath162 with directly measured @xmath9 , and picked out objects for which either the host galaxies appear to be face - on or the @xmath25 fiber aperture is dominated by the galactic bulge contribution .",
    "this selection yielded 33 objects ; their sdss images are shown in figure[f25 ] .",
    "for these objects , we believe that the contamination of the disk , even if significant , should not lead to overestimation of @xmath9 .",
    "their @xmath8 relation is plotted in figure[f26 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the same trend of correlation persists , and all the data points are distributed well below the expected @xmath8 relation for galaxies of tremaine et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "since we have relatively good measurements of @xmath9 for the subsample , we could use them as a standard calibrator to test potential correlations with the width of any narrow emission - lines .",
    "this has practical potential in the sense that in many nls1s , especially luminous ones , the measurement of @xmath9 is not available , that maybe the line width could serve as a good surrogate .",
    "below we test the previously reported relations between @xmath9 and the fwhm of the [ nii ] and [ oiii ] lines .",
    "we plot in figure[f27 ] the fwhm[nii ] values ( deconvolved to remove the effect of the sdss spectral resolution ) versus @xmath9 for 240 out of the 308 nls1s , for which the [ nii ] doublet is detected at the @xmath58 level .",
    "a significant correlation was found at a probability level @xmath163 ( the pearson correlation test ) .",
    "the objects were found to be distributed almost symmetrically with respect to the often quoted relation @xmath164\\sim 2.35~\\sigma_{*}$ ] with a @xmath165 deviation of @xmath11 ( solid line in figure[f27 ] ) .",
    "the result indicates that the [ nii ] emission line can be used as a surrogate for stellar velocity dispersion in nls1s .",
    "we extended the above test to a larger sample of seyfert  2 galaxies compiled from the sdss , comprising some 3 000 objects with high spectral s / n ratios .",
    "a correlation is found very similar to that for the nls1s ( figure[f28 ] ) .",
    "a linear fit yielded @xmath164\\sim 2.62~\\sigma_{*}$ ] , as compared to the often quoted @xmath164\\sim 2.35~\\sigma_{*}$ ] .",
    "we conclude that , for seyfert  2s , @xmath164 $ ] can also be used as a surrogate of @xmath9 .",
    "we find that , after taking all the scatter into account , @xmath164 $ ] can predict black hole masses to within a factor of 3 .    in comparison ,",
    "the [ oiii]@xmath9 correlation is only marginal .",
    "our result suggests that the [ oiii ] line width , which has been widely used in the literature , is actually not a good indicator of the @xmath9 and , hence , of the black hole mass .",
    "in fact , this is not unexpected considering that , in more than half of the nls1s in our sample , the [ oiii ] lines have complex profiles . in a systematic investigation of the stellar and gaseous kinematics in narrow emission - line agns , greene & ho ( 2005 ) also noted the different behavior of the low - ionization lines and [ oiii ] , and pointed out that @xmath155}$ ] can not be directly used to replace @xmath9 .",
    "using a two - component gaussian fit to the [ oiii ] line profiles , the authors found that the core of the [ oiii ] line could trace @xmath9 statistically but with a considerable scatter .",
    "this approach , however , can not yield meaningful results for most of the objects in our sample because of the low s / n ratio and/or the effect of the residuals of the feii emission in their sdss spectra .",
    "having established the good @xmath164$]@xmath9 relation , we can extend the above examination to the black hole ",
    "bulge relation by making use of fwhm[nii ] .",
    "the advantage of so doing is that , compared to @xmath9 , fwhm[nii ] is much easier to measure and is available for a larger number of nls1s . in figure[f29 ] , we plot @xmath10 versus fwhm[nii ] for 613 nls1s with reliably measured fwhm[nii ] .",
    "a correlation is present , but there is a systematic deviation from the equivalent relation expected for galaxies given by tremaine et al .",
    "( 2002 ) transformed from @xmath164=2.35~\\sigma_{*}$ ] ( dashed line ) .",
    "the results confirm those obtained above for a smaller sample by making direct use of @xmath9 ( figure[f24 ] ) .",
    "we have systematically analyzed the spectroscopic data from the qso and galaxy database in the sdss dr3 .",
    "after proper subtraction of the stellar and nuclear continua as well as the feii multiplets , prominent emission lines were carefully modeled and measured with typical relative errors less than 10% . a large sample of @xmath166 nls1s has been selected based on a simple well - defined criterion : the presence of a  broad \" component of the h@xmath7 ( or h@xmath50 ) line with @xmath167 .",
    "the present sample outnumbers previous nls1 samples by a factor of @xmath1 . taking advantage of such an unprecedented large and uniform sample with accurately measured spectral parameters",
    ", we carried out various statistical analyses , some of which were possible only for the first time .",
    "overall , the often quoted frequency @xmath89 is confirmed for finding nls1s in optically selected broad emission - line agns ; meanwhile , the frequency is also found to be strongly dependent on the optical luminosity .",
    "the fraction of nls1s peaks around @xmath3 ( the sdss g-band absolute magnitude ) and drops quickly toward both the high- and low - luminosity ends .",
    "we interpret the lower chance of finding nls1s in high luminosity agns as a result of an imposed upper limit on the eddington ratio ( @xmath109 ) , of a few units",
    ". the smaller fraction in the low luminosity range may arise from the combination of two factors : the shape of the smbh mass function and the distribution of the accretion rate .",
    "low luminosity nls1s contain a very small smbh mass accreting at a very high rate , which are rare in the local universe .",
    "we do not confirm the previous results that @xmath168 of soft x - ray ( e.g. rosat ) selected agns are nls1s .",
    "such a fraction is found only for x - ray bright agns , but drops quickly with decreasing soft x - ray flux .",
    "the frequency of finding nls1s in faint rosat agns ( @xmath169 in the 0.12.4kev band ) is actually the same as in optically selected agns .",
    "the dependence of the nls1 fraction on the soft x - ray luminosity shows the same trend as on the optical luminosity , and the fraction peaks around @xmath170 .",
    "deeper x - ray surveys than the rass are needed to pin down the exact peak luminosity . moreover , we find that the nls1 fraction is also strongly dependent on the radio - loudness and the radio luminosity .",
    "the frequency of finding nls1s in radio - quite agns ( with logarithmic radio - to - optical flux ratio @xmath171 ) is @xmath89 , similar to that for optically selected agns .",
    "this value drops to @xmath83 in moderately strong radio agns ( @xmath172 ) , and further down to @xmath85 in powerful radio agns ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "we find that on average the relative strength of the feii emission ( @xmath115 ) in nls1s is about twice of that in normal agns ; @xmath115 is anti - correlated with the width of the broad component of the balmer emission lines .",
    "the well known correlation between the width of the broad low - ionization line and the soft x - ray spectral slope is found to hold true for nls1s in general ; in addition , it shows some quite peculiar behavior : @xmath122 is anti - correlated with fwhm(h@xmath7 ) in the range @xmath174 , then the trend is reversed in the range @xmath175 .",
    "we find that the equivalent width of the h@xmath7 and feii emission lines are strongly correlated with the h@xmath7 and the continuum luminosity .",
    "we do not find any difference in the nlr properties between nls1s and normal agns .",
    "about 1020% of nls1s show abnormally low line ratios of [ oiii ] to the narrow component of h@xmath7 , which is a result of the contribution of hii regions in the host galaxies .",
    "blueshifts of the [ oiii ] emission line were found in about half of the nls1s , similar to that in normal agns .",
    "stellar velocity dispersions @xmath9 could be measured within statistically meaningful uncertainties for 308 nls1s . for this subsample",
    "we examined the @xmath10@xmath9 relation for nls1s .",
    "we found that the black hole mass is also significantly correlated with the stellar velocity dispersion ; however , the bulk of the nls1s have black hole masses statistically smaller than expected from the @xmath8 relation for normal galaxies and agns .",
    "this results support the hypothesis that nls1s are underage agns , and the growth of their smbh lags behind the formation of the galactic bulge . with a typical relative error @xmath11 , the line width of [ nii ]",
    "is found to be a better indicator of @xmath9 than that of [ oiii ] .",
    "by using a larger subsample with reliably measured fwhm[nii ] , the @xmath10bulge relation for nls1s was further examined and similar results were obtained .",
    "limited by the scope of the this paper , most of the analyses presented above are only phenomenological .",
    "systematic and detailed investigations based on this large data set of some of the interesting aspects as outlined in the introduction (  1 ) are just underway .",
    "for instance , we have initiated a program to study the x - ray spectral and temporal properties of the nls1s in our sample by making use of archival serendipitous data from rosat , xmm - newton and chandra .",
    "the multiwavelength sed can be constructed and studied by compiling data from the existing archives in various wavebands .",
    "the present results on the @xmath8 relation for nls1s are only statistically meaningful ; observations with higher spectral resolution and s / n ratios are needed for more precise results . moreover",
    ", mounting evidence accumulated in the past decade indicates that the agn phenomena and the star formation history are closely linked ; the preliminary result on the @xmath8 relation for nls1s may represent an important link in the sequence of galaxy evolution . in this direction",
    ", we are going to study the stellar content of the host galaxies in the hope of finding any clues to the starburst ",
    ".    some peculiar objects of various rare types have been identified in our nls1 sample , namely , very - radio - loud nls1s , [ oiii ]  blue outliers \" , double - peaked narrow line emitters , uv - deficient nls1s , and bal nls1s .",
    "detailed studies of their properties , which are expected to be useful for constraining agn models , will be addressed in forthcoming papers .    in the above and other related studies of nls1 ,",
    "a major source of uncertainty comes from the determination of the black hole masses .",
    "mass estimation using a one - epoch spectrum is subject to large uncertainties ( cf .",
    ", vestergaard 2004 ) ; reliable measurements of the smbh mass are limited to only a few nls1s so far , however . with interest",
    "we noted that a few percent objects in our nls1 sample have duplicated observations in the sdss , some of which show large amplitude variability ( see figure[f30 ] ) .",
    "this property presents us a great potential of measuring the black hole masses of nls1s by making use of the much more accurate reverberation mapping technique .",
    "we plan to monitor a nls1 sample with a moderate size to select candidates and then to carry out the reverberation mapping .",
