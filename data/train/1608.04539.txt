    "understanding hadron structure and spectrum has been one of the major issues in high energy physics for over half a century .",
    "various models have been studied for this purpose up to now , either treating hadrons as fundamental ( structureless ) particles , or composite systems . today , it is mostly believed that quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the correct model of the fundamental constituents of hadrons @xcite .",
    "however , it appears to be dramatically difficult to explain hadron structure and spectrum relying solely on qcd , and phenomenological models ( such as non - relativistic or relativized quark models ) are still relevant for studies in hadronic physics ( e.g. see @xcite ) , although the connection between such models and qcd has not been rigorously established up to now .",
    "the main difficulty in understanding hadron structure is in revealing the source of the confinement phenomenon on theoretical grounds .",
    "however , the phenomenon is continuously being demonstrated experimentally ( no free quarks or glouns have been detected up to now ) and has to be taken into account for understanding properties of hadrons .",
    "this issue motivates the use of potential models , which also involve a `` confinement potential '' @xcite . in the seminal paper @xcite ,",
    "a `` relativized '' quark model motivated by qcd is constructed and the spectrum and various transitions of mesons are calculated .",
    "due to its non - perturbative nature , non - perturbative methods are necessary to study the hadronic spectrum",
    ". one of these methods for analyzing the spectrum and interactions of hadrons is provided by qcd sum rules @xcite or its improved light cone qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "however , this method provides reliable information concerning only states that are not radially excited , while there are many known radially excited states in the hadron spectrum .",
    "there had been some efforts to study the radially excited states in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "other than potential models , the most promising method for studying excited states ( as well as all other properties of the hadron spectrum ) is lattice qcd , which also has an extensive literature @xcite .",
    "all methods concentrate on calculating physically observable quantities related to hadrons and hadron interactions , though may be regarding part of those as inputs ( e. g. a number of hadron masses ) for the calculations .",
    "hadron interactions constitute part of the observables involving hadrons . in light cone",
    "qcd sum rules , these interactions are expressed in terms of light - cone distribution amplitudes ( lcdas ) @xcite .",
    "hence , it is of crucial importance to be able to calculate these lcdas for the hadrons .",
    "one proposed way to obtain the leading twist lcdas is to use the non - relativistic quark model wave functions obtained through some potential quark models @xcite .",
    "one advantage of this approach is that it also allows one to obtain the lcdas of the radially excited states @xcite . as more and more heavier quarkonia",
    "are being discovered in experiments , the question of radial excitation attracts attention .",
    "especially excitations above open flavor thresholds present a puzzle for the potential quark model calculations .",
    "there are indications that some of these quarkonia , close to or above thresholds , contain both a molecular component , and a quarkonium component @xcite .",
    "although these quarkonium components themselves are not directly observable in nature , to study these mixed quarkonium - molecular systems , it is necessary to know the couplings of the quarkonium component to the molecular component @xcite .",
    "lcdas obtained through wave functions calculated using potential quark models can be a window to study such systems .    in light cone qcd sum rules , to study the coupling of the hadron @xmath0 to those which can be created by the currents @xmath1 and @xmath2 , a correlation correlation function of the following form @xmath3 is analyzed @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ correl ] ) , the hadron @xmath4 is on - shell .",
    "such correlation functions reduce to expressions involving lcdas once an expansion around @xmath5 is performed @xcite .",
    "such an expansion allows one to perform a partial summation of the operators appearing in a usual @xmath6 expansion in terms of their twist , which is defined as the difference between the dimension and spin of an operator @xcite .",
    "although sum rules approach can be used for calculating the lcdas as well ( e. g. @xcite ) , lcdas corresponding to excited states can not be calculated using this method .",
    "relating the lcdas to non - relativistic potential models , circumvents this difficulty .",
    "the connection between wave functions ( calculated by any means , not necessarily using a potential model ) and lcdas has already been studied ( e. g. see @xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "ground state p - wave quarkonium wave functions obtained using a variational wave function have been used to obtain the lcdas . in @xcite , excited s - wave charmonia are studied",
    ". however , lcdas corresponding to the excited p - wave quarkonium states are still to be discussed . in this work ,",
    "relations between the quark model wave functions and leading twist lcdas obtained in @xcite are used .",
    "the quark model wavefunctions are obtained by explicitely solving the model presented in @xcite .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "definitions of light cone coordinates and main results obtained in @xcite are summarized . in this section , the quark model of @xcite",
    "is also presented shortly .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the numerical analysis of our results , and describing model functions for the lcdas .",
    "finally , we conclude our work in section 4 .",
    "the components of some 4-vector @xmath7 in light cone coordinates are defined as@xcite :          where @xmath12 are the momenta of the constituents .",
    "the lcdas , as functions of these light - cone momentum fractions , are obtained by integrating over the transverse momenta .",
    "defined in such a way , they are frame - independent quantities @xcite .        where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the light cone wave functions corresponding the the given hadron quantum numbers and relevant fock states .",
    "when one wishes to calculate hadronic couplings , one encounters matrix elements of the form @xcite @xmath16 . for light like separations",

    "wavefunctions enter the calculation and one can obtain corresponding lcdas in terms of the relevant wavefunctions .    in @xcite ,",
    "a detailed analysis is presented on how to relate the wave functions to the lcdas . for completeness",
    ", main points in their derivation is presented below .",
    "leading twist distribution amplitudes of p - wave heavy quarkonia are extracted from the following matrix elements : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the spacetime seperation between the quark and the anti - quark , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the polarization vector and tensor of the relevant mesons , @xmath9 is the four - momentum , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the mass and decay constant of the relevant mesons , and @xmath30 is the gauge covariant derivative .",
