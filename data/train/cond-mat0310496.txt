    "<S> building on a previous proposal for the entanglement of electron - hole pairs in the fermi sea , we show how 3 qubits can be entangled without using electron - electron interactions . as in the 2-qubit case , </S>",
    "<S> this electronic scheme works even if the sources are in ( local ) thermal equilibrium  in contrast to the photonic analogue . </S>",
    "<S> the 3 qubits are represented by 4 edge - channel excitations in the quantum hall effect ( 2 hole excitations plus 2 electron excitations with identical channel index ) . </S>",
    "<S> the entangler consists of an adiabatic point contact flanked by a pair of tunneling point contacts . </S>",
    "<S> the irreducible 3-qubit entanglement is characterized by the tangle , which is expressed in terms of the transmission matrices of the tunneling point contacts . </S>",
    "<S> the maximally entangled greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state is obtained for channel - independent tunnel probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> we show how low - frequency noise measurements can be used to determine an upper and lower bound to the tangle . </S>",
    "<S> the bounds become tighter the closer the electron - hole state is to the ghz state . </S>"
