    "the study of saturated flow in geological porous media frequently presents natural structures with a dense network of fissures nested in the rock matrix @xcite .",
    "it is also frequent to observe vuggy porous media @xcite , which have the presence of cavities in the rock matrix significantly larger than the average pore size of the medium .",
    "this is a multiple scale physics phenomenon , because there are regions of the medium where the flow velocity is significantly larger than the velocity on the other ones .",
    "the modeling of the interface between regions is subject to very active research : first , fluid transmission conditions across the interface are of great importance , see @xcite for discussion of the governing laws ; see @xcite for a numerical point of view ; see @xcite for the analytic approach and @xcite for a more general perspective .",
    "second , the placement of the interface is debatable since a boundary layer phenomenon between regions occurs , see @xcite for discussion .",
    "the interface couples regions of slow velocity ( order @xmath0 ) and fast flow ( order @xmath1 ) , see figure [ fig artificial perturbation ] . hence , its placement and geometric description become an important issue because perturbations of the interface are inevitable .",
    "on one hand the geological strata data available are always limited , on the other hand the numerical implementation of models involving curvy interfaces , in most of the cases can only approximate the real surface . finally , on a very different line , in the analysis of saturated flow in deformable porous media , one of the aspects is the understanding the geometric perturbations of an _ interface of reference_.    clearly , the continuity of the solution with respect to the geometry of the interface is an important issue which has received very little treatment and mainly limited to flat interfaces .",
    "most of the theoretical achievements in the field of multiscale coupled systems , concentrate their efforts in removing the singularities introduced by the scales using homogenization processes .",
    "these techniques can be either formal @xcite , analytic @xcite or numerical @xcite .    here",
    ", we model the stationary problem with a coupled system of partial differential equations of darcy flow in both regions , in direct variational formulation .",
    "we simulate the region of fast flow scaling by @xmath2 the ratio of permeability over viscosity , as in figure [ fig artificial perturbation ] .",
    "it will be assumed that the real interface @xmath3 is horizontal flat and the perturbed one @xmath4 is curved .",
    "of course a flat surface will not be perturbed when discretized and seems unrealistic to consider perturbations of it .",
    "our choice is motivated by two reasons : first , for the sake of clarity in the notation , calculation and interpretation of the results .",
    "second , when studying the phenomenon of saturated flow in _ deformable porous media _ perturbations of a flat surface are of interest . finally it is important to highlight that the mathematical essentials of the problem are captured in this framework .",
    "the paper starts proving in section 2 , that the solutions depend continuously with respect to the interface , then it moves to the much deeper question of exploring the dependence itself . in section 3",
    "the one dimensional case the rate of convergence question is solved completely using orthogonal decomposition of adequate subspaces , finally section 4 reveals the highly nonlinear dependence of the solutions with respect to the interface .",
