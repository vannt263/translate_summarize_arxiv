    "high - temperature ( ht ) expansions for scalar spin models with bilinear nearest - neighbor interaction and general single - spin measure , on 2- and 3-dimensional bipartite lattices , have been extended@xcite in the last few decades from order @xmath3 to @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 denotes the usual ht expansion variable , with @xmath6 the boltzmann constant , @xmath7 the temperature and @xmath8 some energy scale characterizing the next - neighbor interaction .",
    "the main observables expanded , include the susceptibility @xmath9 , the second moment of the correlation - function @xmath10 , the zero - momentum four - point function @xmath11 .",
    "the linked - cluster method used in these calculations expresses the series coefficients in a closed form as polynomials in the ( normalized ) moments of the single - spin measure thus making the analysis of a broad class of models possible .",
    "this fact entails two related benefits .",
    "first , it enables one to explore the extent of the ising universality class to which these models should generally belong .",
    "second , one can take advantage of the non - universality of the amplitudes of the corrections to scaling in the critical behavior to obtain very accurate estimates of universal critical parameters , such as exponents and scaling functions , by focusing the numerical analysis on those particular spin models , within the given universality class , which show vanishing ( or quite small ) leading corrections to scaling(lcs ) .",
    "this prescription , which can be effective only with rather long series , was suggested in refs.@xcite and extensively tested by 21-term ht series on the body - centered - cubic lattice , for various single - spin measures .    in the initial studies , however , the available series were simply too short . in ref.@xcite",
    "an analysis of the critical properties of the lattice @xmath12 euclidean field theory in two- , three- and four - dimensional space , using tenth - order ht series , suggested a complicated and puzzling critical behavior in the 3d case , which showed failures of universality and hyperscaling and cast doubt on the validity of key mathematical assumptions@xcite ( see however ref.@xcite ) in the application of the renormalization group to the critical phenomena .",
    "this analysis was historically important in raising questions which could be answered only by numerical investigation of specific models and was a strong incentive to further extend the ht series and to repeat and improve simulation studies .",
    "the anomalous features observed in ref.@xcite were not confirmed by the successive studies@xcite and were finally ascribed to the shortness of the series analyzed .",
    "therefore over a decade ago the problem was considered as settled .",
    "we have recently extended , through order @xmath4 , the ht expansions of the moments of the correlation - function and , through order @xmath13 , the expansion of the zero - momentum four - point correlation - function for a general scalar model defined on three - dimensional bipartite lattices ( such as the simple - cubic ( sc ) and the body - centered - cubic ( bcc ) lattices ) .",
    "these expansions have already proved useful for accurately displaying the properties of critical scaling and universality of the spin-@xmath14 ising model@xcite and have also produced high - precision estimates of critical exponents and universal combinations of critical amplitudes , based on the prescriptions of refs.@xcite . also following the lead of the same authors@xcite ,",
    "analogous expansions , independently obtained@xcite for the sc lattice case , through order 25 for @xmath15 and @xmath10 and through order 21 for @xmath16 , were used to study the lattice @xmath17 model in a neighborhood of a particular value of the self - coupling for which the lcs are negligible .",
    "it remains to show that the present ht expansions are also adequate for an extensive and accurate study of the scalar field model for two different lattices and on the whole range of the self - coupling . from our study",
    "we conclude that the present ht series are sufficiently long that , by properly resumming them , our analysis can reach an accuracy comparable or higher than the most extensive montecarlo simulations .",
    "moreover , we show that also in the case of the bcc lattice , we can approximately determine a value of the quartic self - coupling such that the lcs vanish , and thereby we can obtain@xcite very accurate estimates of the universal critical parameters in complete agreement with the other cited recent computations@xcite .    in the following paragraphs we shall first recall the definitions of the quantities whose",
    "ht expansions are studied .",
    "we shall then very briefly comment on the results of the series analysis .",
    "we shall map out the phase diagram of the model and exhibit its universality properties along the critical line , such as the independence of the critical exponents @xmath18 and @xmath19 on the self - coupling of the field and on the lattice structure .",
    "then , we shall give evidence that the critical renormalized coupling constant is universal and non - zero , thus verifying the validity of hyperscaling .",
    "finally we shall report our best estimates of the critical exponents @xmath18 and @xmath19 and of the renormalized four - point coupling from the analysis of the model with minimal lcs on the bcc lattice .",
    "the figures summarizing our results are among the main motivations of this study , since some of them qualitatively differ from the analogous ones appearing in ref.@xcite , which , to the best of our knowledge , have never been revised in the literature .",
    "the lattice @xmath20 model is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath21 here @xmath22 and @xmath23 are integer - component ( multi)indices denoting the sites of a three - dimensional lattice and the first sum extends to all nearest - neighbor sites .",

    "in figs . [ fig_1_phi43 ] and [ fig_2_phi43 ] we have mapped out the phase diagrams of the @xmath20 model on the sc and the bcc lattices , respectively . there are two phases separated by a line @xmath59 of second - order critical points . in the disordered phase , below the critical line , the reflection symmetry @xmath60 is unbroken . for @xmath61",
    "the model reduces to the gaussian model and we have @xmath62 on the sc lattice ( @xmath63 on the bcc lattice ) , where @xmath64 is the lattice coordination number . for @xmath65",
    "the model reduces to the usual spin-@xmath66 ising model and we have @xmath67 on the sc lattice ( @xmath68 on the bcc lattice ) as indicated in our general study@xcite of the spin-@xmath14 ising model . in table 1",
    "we have reported numerical estimates of @xmath35 for a few values of @xmath69 in the sc and the bcc lattice cases .",
    "these estimates are obtained by the following simple procedure . using the susceptibility expansion , for each value of @xmath58",
    ", we form the sequence @xmath70 of zinn - justin modified - ratio approximants ( mra)@xcite of the critical point .",

    "we expect that the exponent @xmath41 be universal , namely independent of @xmath58 and indeed , to a good approximation , the asymptotic behavior of the mra sequences is consistent with the value @xmath73 suggested by a recent simultaneous study@xcite of a set of models in the ising universality class . since , for all values of @xmath58 , the contributions of the higher - order terms in eq.([fitbeta ] ) appear to be small , particularly so in the bcc lattice case , we shall assume that the mra sequences @xmath70 can be extrapolated to infinite length @xmath74 of the series simply by fitting the highest - order ( alternate ) approximants to the first two terms of the asymptotic expansion ( [ fitbeta ] ) .",
    "the values of @xmath35 determined by this prescription are quite stable , both under small variations of @xmath75 and of the fitting procedure , such as including in the fit higher - order terms of the expansion ( [ fitbeta ] ) .",
    "our conclusion is that at least five decimal figures of the result are reliable .",
    "these estimates are then refined by comparing the results of the extrapolations with the determination of @xmath35 from first- , second- and third - order differential approximants(da ) @xcite and finally error bars are inferred which are likely to be only upper bounds .",
    "as expected , these uncertainties , which reflect the differences between the estimates by extrapolated mra sequences and by das , depend strongly on the size of the corrections to scaling and therefore on the value of @xmath58 , but of course they are generally invisible on the scale of figures [ fig_1_phi43 ] and [ fig_2_phi43 ] .      in figs .",
    "[ fig_3_phi43 ] and [ fig_4_phi43 ] , referring to the sc and the bcc lattices respectively , we have plotted our estimates of the exponent of the susceptibility @xmath39 vs. @xmath76 . also in this case ,",

    "we can observe that also these mra sequences are smooth , but a simple minded extrapolation based on a fit of the sequences @xmath77 to the first two terms of the asymptotic expansion ( [ fitgamma ] ) can not lead to very accurate estimates of @xmath39 , because , even at the present order of expansion , the contribution of higher - order corrections is not sufficiently small . in the figures [ fig_3_phi43 ] and [ fig_4_phi43 ] , we have represented by solid lines",
    "the estimates @xmath39 obtained from the mras @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , which use the susceptibility series only up to the orders @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively .",
    "these estimates show a rapid crossover from the gaussian value @xmath86 to a behavior which , for @xmath87 , tends to become independent of @xmath58 and to approach the dashed line in the figure indicating the central value @xmath88 of our estimate in ref.@xcite for the ising universality class .",
    "if we include higher correction terms in the asymptotic expansion ( [ fitgamma ] ) somewhat more accurate estimates of @xmath39 can be obtained .",
    "the simplest possibility is to introduce a single effective higher correction @xmath89 with @xmath58-independent exponent @xmath90 .",
    "choosing the value @xmath91 , we obtain the estimates represented by the dotted curve",
    ". the accuracy of the approximation can be further improved at the expense of the simplicity of the fitting procedure , but here it is sufficient to indicate only the qualitative trend . in the same figures ,",
    "we have also reported estimates of @xmath39 obtained by simple first - order unbiased das using all available series coefficients . in order to keep the figures readable ,",
    "these data are restricted to a smaller range of values of @xmath58 of particular interest .",
    "completely analogous results are obtained starting with the ht series for the correlation - length squared @xmath92 to determine the critical exponent @xmath19 but , for brevity , they will not be reported here .      in fig .",
    "[ fig_5_phi43 ] we have plotted vs. @xmath58 the amplitude @xmath40 of the lcs in ( [ suscrit ] ) , as obtained by fitting the mra sequence @xmath70 to the asymptotic expansion ( [ fitbeta ] ) in the bcc lattice case . of course , the determination of @xmath40 is much more sensitive than @xmath35 to the inclusion of higher - order corrections in the fit to the expansion ( [ fitbeta ] ) .",
    "the most convincing results are obtained when a single additional correction @xmath93 is included .",
    "this three - parameter fit changes the results of the two - parameter fit for @xmath35 only within the estimated uncertainties and does not alter the qualitative structure of @xmath40 , but only brings its evaluation into closer agreement with the corresponding estimate of @xmath40 from a similarly improved fit to eq.([fitgamma ] ) and with the values of @xmath94 obtained in earlier works@xcite .",
    "the uncertainty of the final results should not exceed @xmath95 . in the case of the sc lattice ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath40 is similar , but @xmath40 can not be determined with comparable accuracy by this straightforward method because it is even more sensitive to the presence of higher - order corrections in ( [ fitbeta ] ) .",
    "the important fact is however that , both in the sc and the bcc lattice cases , when @xmath58 increases from @xmath96 to @xmath97 , the amplitude @xmath40 of the lcs in eq.([suscrit ] ) varies from positive to negative values . in the sc lattice case @xmath40",
    "vanishes at @xmath98 .",
    "we recall that the above cited numerical analysis of the @xmath17 ht series on the sc lattice@xcite was indeed performed precisely at @xmath99 . in the bcc lattice case",
    "we find that the zero of @xmath40 occurs at @xmath100 .",
    "in ref.@xcite @xmath101 had been determined by an appropriate montecarlo simulation . in our approach",
    "no preliminary montecarlo simulation is needed to determine @xmath102 , since , knowing the structure of the function @xmath40 , our study of the model on the whole range of values of @xmath58 directly gives a sufficiently accurate indication .",
    "for @xmath58 in a neighborhood of the zero of the lcs amplitude , we can observe that the various approximations of @xmath39 , shown in figs .",
    "[ fig_3_phi43 ] and [ fig_4_phi43 ] , tend to coincide and come nearest to our earlier estimate@xcite for the spin @xmath14 ising model : @xmath103 shown in the figure by a dashed line .",

    "[ fig_3_phi43 ] and [ fig_4_phi43 ] approach their constant limiting value from below and otherwise from above . of course , the same mode of approach to the limit can be observed for the estimates obtained from das , when varying the number of ht series coefficients used in the approximants , however , for clarity we have reported in the figures only the highest order results .",
    "we can now take advantage of our estimate of @xmath102 to compute some universal critical parameters of the @xmath17 model on the bcc lattice with approximately vanishing lcs .",
    "the ht series coefficients of @xmath15 , @xmath10 and @xmath16 on the bcc lattice , for @xmath106 , are reported in table ii .",
    "( the corresponding expansions in the sc lattice case , for @xmath107 , can be found in ref.@xcite . )",
    "very accurate estimates are thus obtained for the critical exponents and the critical renormalized coupling . in particular , using first- and second - order das ( either unbiased or biased with the critical value @xmath108 ) , we find @xmath109 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 in good agreement with our previous estimates@xcite and with the results of ref.@xcite .",
    "our estimated errors account also for the @xmath110 uncertainty in the estimate of @xmath111 .",

    ", all curves appear to tend to a @xmath58- and lattice - independent limiting value @xmath120 which is consistent with our estimate in ref.@xcite of the critical renormalized coupling in the ising universality class @xmath121 indicated in the figure by the dashed line .",
    "this fact suggests that the critical renormalized coupling is universal with respect to the self - coupling @xmath58 and to the structure of the lattice and moreover that it is non - zero ( so that hyperscaling is valid ) .",
    "the curves in the figures 6 and 7 are obtained in a most straightforward way from the highest - order non - defective `` simplified differential approximants''(sda ) @xcite biased with the values of @xmath75 and @xmath35 .",
    "completely equivalent results are obtained also , slightly more laboriously , using ordinary biased das instead of sdas . the estimated width of the error bars is comparable to the thickness of the lines . also for @xmath117 , we can observe that , as @xmath58 varies from @xmath96 to @xmath97 , the amplitude @xmath122 of the lcs in ( [ grencrit ] ) , which is negative for small @xmath58 , changes sign at @xmath123 , as it should , because the ratio @xmath124 is expected to be universal .",
    "correspondingly , as shown clearly by these figures , the curves tend to their common limiting value from below if @xmath125 and otherwise from above .    figs .",

    "all curves are monotonically increasing in @xmath58 and show a rapid crossover from the gaussian value @xmath127 to a shape increasingly flatter as @xmath92 becomes large .",
    "for @xmath125 , as @xmath119 , the sequence of curves tends from below to the constant @xmath120 , for @xmath128 the same value is approached from above .",
    "we have already stressed , that this pattern of behavior simply reflects the fact that the amplitude @xmath122 of the lcs in @xmath54 is negative for @xmath125 and positive for @xmath128 .",
    "here we should also recall that in a similar plot reported in ref.@xcite ( only the case of the bcc lattice case is discussed in that study ) the curves show quite a different structure for @xmath129 .",
    "in particular , the curves @xmath117 in ref.@xcite are not monotonic in @xmath58 and their limiting behavior as @xmath119 does not appear to be universal and non - zero .",
    "we can see no reason for these anomalous features other than the insufficient length of the ten - term ht series used in the analysis of ref.@xcite .",
    "one more view of the same data is presented in figs .",
    "[ fig_10_phi43 ] and [ fig_11_phi43 ] , for the sc and the bcc lattices respectively , showing contour plots of @xmath117 in the @xmath130 , @xmath131 plane .",
    "also these figures are qualitatively different from the corresponding ones of ref.@xcite which show a spurious saddle - point structure and suggest a failure of universality .",
    "nothing like that can be inferred from our updated figures .      in conclusion , we have analyzed ht expansions for a one - parameter family of continuous spin models which interpolate between the gaussian and the spin-1/2 ising models . in the case of the bcc lattice , we have taken advantage of the parameter dependence of the amplitudes of the lcs to improve the accuracy in the determination of some universal critical quantities .",
    "moreover , we have shown that , in the light of our extended series , all puzzling and unexpected features which emerged from the old ht analysis of ref.@xcite can only be ascribed to numerical inaccuracies deriving from the use of too short series .",
