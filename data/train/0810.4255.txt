    "fragmentation functions ( ffs ) constitute one of the most important free inputs required for a comprehensive description of most collider processes to which perturbative qcd is applicable , being a necessary ingredient in any sufficiently complete calculation of processes involving detected hadrons in the final state .",
    "they quantify the hadronization of quarks and gluons which must eventually occur in every process in which hadrons are produced . while parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , another of the important free inputs , are relevant for collisions involving at least one hadron , most importantly at present for @xmath4 collisions at the lhc , ffs are relevant in principle for all collisions , even those without any initial state hadrons such as electron - positron collisions at the future ilc . furthermore , while knowledge and application of pdfs is limited to the types of hadrons that can be practically used in the initial state , being almost exclusively nucleons , ffs can be constrained by , and/or used for the predictions of , measurements of the inclusive productions of neutral and charged hadron species ranging from the almost massless to the very heavy .",
    "such a large range of processes provides a large range of information on hadronization , and hence provides an important contribution to our understanding of non perturbative physics in general , and allows for a particularly incontrovertible phenomenological determination of the applicability and limitations of the various approximations used in the context of qcd factorization .",
    "such data are also sufficiently accurate to allow for competitive extractions of @xmath1 , the strong coupling constant of qcd evolved for convenience to the @xmath5-pole mass @xmath6 and the remaining of the most important free inputs , which improves the accuracy of perturbative qcd calculations in general and imposes constraints on new physics .",
    "we note here that while other inputs such as higher twist , multi - hadron ffs , fracture functions , and so on become important in certain kinematic limits , ffs are always necessary for a complete description of inclusive hadron production .    in this article",
    ", we review the progress in understanding the hadronization of partons , embodied in ffs , and their application to inclusive hadron production .",
    "the concept of fragmentation was first introduced by feynman and field in 1977 @xcite to explain the limited transverse momenta and energy fraction scaling of hadrons in jets produced in @xmath0 collisions , as well as the presence of a few high transverse momentum ( @xmath7 ) gev hadrons in hadron - hadron collisions . in the latter case , the collision of a pointlike constituent particle of one hadron with that of another produces a pair of particles whose directions of motion are opposite to one another but at any angle to the parent particles , including large angles .",
    "these elementary particles must eventually hadronize to produce the high @xmath8 hadrons .",
    "intuitively , any inclusive single hadron production processes may be predicted by first calculating the equivalent partonic process ( i.e.  replacing the produced hadron by a parton and the inclusive sum over hadron final states by partonic ones ) , then allowing the produced parton to hadronize .",
    "this _ parton model _ is made more precise by the factorization theorem .",
    "our discussion will be limited to inclusive single unpolarized hadron production , being better understood than its polarized counterpart .",
    "final state partons will on average hadronize to hadrons of all species that are not kinematically forbidden by the particular reaction , but , of all the charged hadrons , partons will mostly hadronize to the 3 lightest ones , being ,  and , so their ffs are the most phenomenologically well constrained .",
    "( for a concise summary of the properties of some known mesons and baryons , see ref .",
    "the species of neutral meson and neutral baryon most likely to be produced in the hadronization process are @xmath9 , and @xmath10 respectively , but their ffs are accurately approximated by the ffs for   and due to su(2 ) ( nuclear ) isospin symmetry between the @xmath11 and @xmath12 quark flavours .",
    "the next lightest species of meson and baryon is  and  respectively , whose ffs have therefore also been greatly studied .",
    "( @xmath13 is not usually observed in experiment because it takes a long time to decay into charged particles . ) together with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 mesons , whose ffs are unfortunately either unknown or rather poorly known at present , the particles mentioned in this paragraph complete the list of known hadrons which have a mass less than or equal to the  mass and which are the most copiously produced in hadron production , and thus measurements of their production lead to a rather comprehensive picture of the hadronic final state . in this review",
    "we shall focus on the productions of these particles only , with the exceptions of the productions of those mesons just listed .",
    "much of the techniques for global fitting of pdfs can be carried over to global fitting of ffs , for example the treatment of systematic errors on the experimental data and the propagation of experimental errors to the ffs , as well as the techniques used for the minimization of chi - squared . on the theoretical side , much of the formalism of both the _ fixed order _ ( fo ) calculations and its improvement via e.g.  large @xmath23 resummation and incorporation of heavy quarks and their masses , is also very similar .    to date , the subject of fragmentation has been important in various areas of phenomenology @xcite , and we give an incomplete list of examples : phenomenological constraints on the nucleon pdfs for polarized quarks and antiquarks separately , which are important for the determination of the source of nucleon spin , can be obtained from measurements of semi - inclusive dis with polarized initial state particles for the inclusive production of single unpolarized light charged hadrons using knowledge of the ffs for these particles @xcite .",
    "valence quark pdfs can be similarly extracted , but from data for which the initial state particles are unpolarized @xcite .",
    "in both cases , the differences between ffs for positively and negatively charged particles , are required , which are relatively poorly constrained by data from e.g.  @xmath4 reactions , and not by accurate @xmath0 reaction data . polarized @xmath3 reaction data from e.g.  rhic can also impose constraints on the nucleon pdf for the polarized gluon @xcite , and measurements of photoproduction in polarized @xmath2 reaction at e.g.  the proposed erhic @xcite or lhec @xcite colliders can impose constraints on the photon pdf for polarized partons @xcite .",
    "ffs provide a consistency check on transverse momentum dependent ffs , which replace ffs when the transverse momentum of the produced hadron is measured in addition to the longitudinal , since formally the ffs are reproduced by integrating them over the transverse momentum .",
    "the suppression of @xmath9 production in heavy ion collisions ( au au ) relative to @xmath4 collisions @xcite measured by the phenix collaboration at rhic , and to be further investigated by the alice , atlas and cms collaborations at the lhc , provides information on the much anticipated scenario of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) that filled the universe the first ten millionths of a second after the big bang and created the primordial matter .",
    "such studies may therefore contribute to our understanding of both cosmology and the physics of non perturbative qcd .",
    "photons produced by partonic fragmentation @xcite contribute significantly to the photonic background of various direct photon signals in dis , such as that of higgs boson production from hadrons .",
    "fragmentation of a quark to a lepton pair @xcite or , equivalently , to a virtual photon @xcite , is perturbatively calculable if the invariant mass is much greater than @xmath24 , in contrast to ffs for hadrons and the photon , so measurement of the polarization of the virtual photon that decays to the lepton pair of the drell - yan cross section can be used to test models of the formation of @xmath25 particles , whose production from fragmentation is otherwise similar to that of the virtual photon . in ref .  @xcite it has been proposed to identify exotic hadrons such as tetraquarks by identifying properties of ffs which are typical for quarks whose flavour is favoured , i.e.   that are of the same flavour as any of the produced hadron s valence quarks .",

    "however , to ensure that the perturbative calculation of @xmath54 gives a reliable approximation , all partons of mass @xmath101 must be assigned as active , even if they are not active at @xmath102 .",

    "the only non zero components at nlo are @xmath111 , which vanishes if the matching is done at @xmath112 , and @xmath113 .",
    "the latter quantity is not needed if the whole ff of the @xmath103th flavour quark , both intrinsic and extrinsic , is treated as one single function to be fitted to data , which is usually the case .",
    "this is in contrast to the spacelike case : because intrinsic heavy quark pdfs for the proton can normally be neglected , the quantity @xmath113 is necessary for obtaining the pdf of the @xmath103th flavour quark , being almost completely extrinsic .    according to eq .",
    "( [ mathcondffs ] ) , a heavy quark ff with a negligible intrinsic component ( i.e.  its ff vanishes when it is not active ) is fully determined from the other ffs . therefore ,",
    "if the intrinsic components of the heavy quarks ffs are negligible , their ffs are perturbatively completely determined by only the gluon and the light quarks in the @xmath114 scheme : using eq .",
    "( [ mathcondffs ] ) to convert to @xmath115 scheme gives the charm quark ff in terms of the gluon and light quark ffs , i.e.  charm quark fragmentation proceeds via perturbative fragmentation to a gluon or light quark , which then fragments non perturbatively to the detected hadron . similarly the bottom quark ff for @xmath116 active quark flavours is fully determined from the gluon , light and charm quark ffs .",
    "on the other hand , it may not be a good approximation to neglect the intrinsic heavy quark ffs even for light hadrons , and the intrinsic charm ff is certainly not negligible for charmed hadrons such as @xmath117 mesons .",
    "in many calculations for light hadron production , the charm quark ff @xmath118 is treated as an unknown function at the matching scale where @xmath119 , just as the gluon and light quark flavour ffs at the initial scale @xmath100 are , and the gluon and all 4 quark ffs are evolved from there according to the dglap equation of the @xmath115 scheme . a similar procedure is performed for the bottom quark ff .",
    "while this incorporation of intrinsic charm in the @xmath115 scheme is consistent with the factorization scheme , the conventional approach of setting the complete charm quark ff to zero in the cross section calculated in the @xmath114 scheme is not , because intrinsic charm quark fragmentation effects should not depend on the choice of scheme ( although the precise definition of the intrinsic charm quark ff itself is scheme dependent ) .",
    "consequently , this approach contains an inconsistency : when the energy , and therefore the factorization , scale is close to the charm quark mass so that both the 3 and 4 flavour number schemes should be valid , they will lead to very different cross sections in the case that the intrinsic charm quark ff is large . in practice , this inconsistency of the 3 flavour scheme , and 4 flavour scheme when one also considers a possibly important bottom quark ff , does not matter since most cross sections of interest are of a sufficiently high energy scale that the 5 flavour scheme should suffice for all calculations .      in the above discussion",
    ", we have assumed that all quarks have non negligible but finite masses . in practice ,",
    "the energy scale is usually not close to any quark mass , so all perturbative results are usually approximated by the zero mass variable flavour number `` scheme '' ( zm - vfns ) , where the masses @xmath120 of all quarks above @xmath82 are set to infinity so that these quarks decouple from the theory , which introduces a relative error of @xmath121 to the cross section , while all quarks with masses below are treated as active and their masses @xmath51 are set to zero , which introduces a relative error of @xmath122 .",
    "such an approach therefore fails when the energy scale is of the order of a quark mass , but is otherwise a reasonable approximation .",
    "however , the procedure we have been discussing in the previous subsections is more general and is called the general mass variable flavour number scheme ( gm - vfns ) , where both quarks and their masses are treated in a similar fashion to their treatment in the aivazis - collins - olness - tung ( acot ) scheme @xcite of spacelike factorization .",
    "such a procedure has for example been explicitly implemented for heavy flavour hadrons in photo- @xcite and hadroproduction @xcite in @xmath123 reactions , and more recently for @xmath0 reactions @xcite .",
    "the usual simplifications and improvements that have been made to the acot scheme since its inception may also be applied to fragmentation , at least in principle .",
    "for example , assuming that the intrinsic fragmentation of heavy quarks is negligible , the power suppressed terms in the nlo factorized cross section for the inclusive production of this heavy quark appearing in the overall hadronic cross section are in fact arbitrary , since the only purpose of the former cross section in this case is to complete the cancellation of all potential mass singularities in the overall hadronic cross section such that there are no singularities in the massless limit @xcite . in the s - acot scheme @xcite , these power suppressed terms are set to zero for simplicity , while in the acot(@xmath124 ) scheme @xcite , the accuracy of the perturbative calculation relative to the original acot scheme is improved : the heavy quark production cross section is again chosen to be that for the production of a massless quark as in the s - acot scheme , but its lo part is also multiplied by a @xmath29 dependent step function which is equal to that multiplying the gluon production cross section s potential mass singularity , to ensure it and its counterterm only ever appear at the same time .",

[ su2isospinres ] however , it should be noted here that some hadrons are not produced by direct partonic fragmentation , but rather by decay from another hadron , which itself may have been produced either by partonic fragmentation or hadronic decay . if the decay channels involved in the production of e.g.  @xmath9 and  do not respect su(2 ) isospin symmetry , the relation between their ffs above will be violated even if it is true for direct fragmentation .    a valuable consequence of the second result in eq .",

    "this is similar to the consequence from charge conjugation symmetry that the difference between @xmath300 and @xmath301 depends only on the charge - sign asymmetry ffs , except for the absence of @xmath0 reaction data in that case .",
    "the assumption @xmath302 may be violated by those  and arising from complicated decay channels involving other hadrons instead of from direct partonic fragmentation , which may differ between  and . however , su(2 ) isospin suggests that these hadronic decay processes for  should be similar to those for .",
    "an indication of this is found in the akk08 fit because the fitted masses of  and  differ from their true masses by the same amount , as will be discussed in subsection [ akk08 ] .",
    "since the non singlet splitting functions and coefficient functions for @xmath0 reactions are known to nnlo , the non singlet @xmath303 can also be extracted , and through it @xmath304 , to nnlo .",
    "such a procedure would be similar to the nnlo extraction of the non singlet pdf @xmath305 and @xmath304 using data from proton and deuteron targets @xcite , and would allow for a further test of perturbative stability in the timelike case .    aside from the rather limited measurements of tagging probabilities from opal @xcite , defined in eq .",
    "( [ tagprobp ] ) , measurements at lep , taken at center - of - mass ( c.m . ) energies at the @xmath5 pole mass , have not implemented tagging of individual flavours of light quarks .",
