    "synchronization of nonlinear oscillators is widely studied in physical and biological systems  @xcite for underlying interests ranging from novel communications strategies  @xcite to understanding how large and small neural assemblies efficiently and sensitively achieve desired functional goals  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of biological systems may , beyond their intrinsic interest , often provide physicists with novel dynamical systems possessing interesting properties in their component oscillators or in the nature of the interconnections .",
    "we have presented our analysis of the experimental synchronization of two biological neurons as the electrical coupling between them is changed in sign and magnitude  @xcite .",
    "subsequent to that analysis we have developed computer simulations of the dynamics of the neurons which are based on conductance based hodgkin - huxley ( hh )  @xcite neuron models .",
    "these numerical simulations quantitatively reproduced the observations in the laboratory  @xcite .",
    "the study of isolated neurons from the stomatogastric ganglion ( stg ) of the california spiny lobster  _ panulirus interruptus _ using tools of nonlinear time series analysis  @xcite shows that the number of active degrees of freedom in their membrane potential oscillations typically ranges from three to five  @xcite .",
    "the appearance of low dimensional dynamics in this biological system led us to develop models of its action potential activity which are substantially simpler than the hh models we and others  @xcite have used to describe these systems .",
    "we adopted the framework established by hindmarsh and rose ( hr )  @xcite in which the complicated current voltage relationships of the conductance based models are replaced by polynomials in the dynamical variables , and the coefficients in the polynomials are estimated by analyzing the observed current / voltage curves for the neurons under study .",
    "building on biological experiments and on numerical analysis of models for the oscillations of isolated neurons , we have constructed low dimensional analog electronic neurons ( ens ) whose properties are designed to emulate the membrane voltage characteristics of the individual neurons . using these simple",
    ", low dimensional ens we report here their synchronization and regularization properties , first when they are coupled electrically as the sign and magnitude of the coupling is varied , and then when they are coupled by excitatory and inhibitory chemical synapses .",
    "we have also studied the behavior of an hybrid system , i.e. , one en and one biological neuron coupled electrically . as our models were developed on data acquired from biological neurons in synaptic isolation , the results we present here on pairs of interacting ens and hybrid systems serve to provide further confirmation of the properties of those model neurons , numerical and analog .",
    "we have studied and built three dimensional and four dimensional models of hr type having the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the constants which embody the underlying current and conductance based dynamics in this polynomial representation of the neural dynamics .",
    "@xmath3 is the membrane voltage in the model , @xmath4 represents a `` fast '' current in the ion dynamics , and we choose @xmath5 , so @xmath6 is a `` slow '' current . taken alone the first three equations of the model can reproduce several modes of spiking - bursting activity observed in stg cells .",
    "the first three equations were used in analog realization for our earlier experiments with 3d ens  @xcite    the equation for @xmath7 represents an even slower dynamical process ( @xmath8 ) , and it is included because a slow process such as the calcium exchange between intracellular stores and the cytoplasm was found to be required in hodgkin - huxley modeling  @xcite to fully reproduce the observed chaotic oscillations of stg neurons .",
    "both the three dimensional and four dimensional models have regions of chaotic behavior , but the four dimensional model has much larger regions in parameter space where chaos occurs , presumably for many of the same reasons the calcium dynamics gives rise to chaos in hh modeling .",
    "the calcium dynamics is an additional degree of freedom with a time constant three times slower than the characteristic bursting times .    in our analog circuit realization of the en model we used @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the implementation of these constants in analog circuits always has about 5% tolerance in the components .",
    "the main parameters we used in controlling the modes of spiking and bursting activity of the model are the dc external current @xmath11 and the time constants @xmath12 and @xmath13 of the slow variables .",
    "figure  [ 4dphases ] shows a chaotic time series of the four variables using the parameters above .",
    "note how @xmath14 modulates the length of the bursts in @xmath15 .",
    "each local minimum in the global oscillations of @xmath14 coincides with a short burst period .",
    "the complexity achieved by the addition of @xmath14 can be observed in the projections of @xmath16 space to various three - dimensional spaces , @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively , as shown in figure  [ 4dphases ] .",
    "table 1 presents the lyapunov exponents @xmath19 calculated from the vector field  @xcite of equation (  [ eq : hrmodel ] ) for the 3d and 4d ens .",
    "a positive lyapunov exponent is present in both models , indicating conclusively that they are oscillating chaotically . from this spectrum of lyapunov exponents",
    ", we can evaluate the lyapunov dimension @xmath20 which is an estimate of the fractal dimension of the strange attractor for the ens  @xcite .",
    "the lyapunov dimension is defined by finding that number of lyapunov exponents @xmath19 satisfying @xmath21 then @xmath20 is defined as @xmath22 @xmath20 for each en is displayed in the last column table 1 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table 1 : lyapunov exponents @xmath19 and lyapunov dimension @xmath20 calculated from the vector field ( equation (  [ eq : hrmodel ] ) ) for the 3d and 4d electronic neuron models . as a reminder to the reader : the sum of all lyapunov exponents must be negative , and this is so for our results . also , one lyapunov exponent must be 0 as we are dealing with a differential equation .",
    "we designed and built an analog electronic circuit which integrates equation ( [ eq : hrmodel ] ) .",
    "we chose to build an analog device instead of using numerical integration of the mathematical model on the cpu of a pc or on a dsp board because digital integration of these equations is a slow procedure associated with the three different time scales in the model .",
    "furthermore , a digital version of an en requires digital to analog and analog to digital converters to connect the model to biological cells .",
    "analog circuits are small , simple and inexpensive devices ; it is easy to connect them to a biological cell , as we discuss below ( see also  @xcite ) . in a practical sense",
    "nearly an unlimited number of them can work together in real - time experiments .",
    "finally , looking ahead to the construction of real - time networks of large number of these neurons , analog implementation is a necessity .",
    "the block diagram of the analog circuit we use to represent the three dimensional and the four dimensional ens is shown in figure ( [ 4dcircuit ] ) .",
    "it includes four integrators indicated by @xmath23 , two multipliers , two adders , and two inverters .",
    "we used off - the - shelf general purpose operational amplifiers , national instruments model tl082 , to build the integrators , adder and inverter and used analog devices model ad633 as analog multipliers .",
    "the integrator at the top of the diagram receives all components of @xmath24 , e.g. @xmath25 , @xmath26 , etc .",
    "it has an additional input ( called @xmath27 ) which can be used for connections with other circuits or neurons .",
    "the integrators invert the sign of their input , so the output signal will be @xmath28 multiplied by a time constant @xmath29 chosen to make the en oscillate on the same time scale as the biological neurons . the signal @xmath28 is used to generate the nonlinear functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 and these values go to the second and third integrators .",
    "similarly , the other integrators generate voltages proportional to @xmath4 , @xmath32 , and @xmath7 .",
    "a renormalization was made in the rest of the time constants in the circuit to make @xmath33 .",
    "note that this rescaling is responsible for the different amplitudes in the numerical ( figure  [ 4dphases ] ) and analog ( figures  [ free ] ,  [ posel ] ,  [ negel ] ,  [ exchem ] ,  [ inchem ] ) experiments .",
    "this circuit design allows us to easily switch from a three dimensional to a four dimensional model of the neuron .",
    "we can connect or disconnect one wire , indicated as point a in figure  [ 4dcircuit ] , to enable or disable the circuit block shown in the rectangle with a dashed outline . in equation([eq",
    ": hrmodel ] ) this corresponds to setting @xmath34 in the @xmath35 equation .",
    "the block indicated as na in figure  [ 4dcircuit ] is an adjustable nonlinear amplifier .",
    "we use it to rescale and change the shape of the output signal @xmath3 .",
    "it can shrink or stretch different parts of the waveform , change the amplitude and move the trace as a whole up or down .",
    "this shape adjustment is particularly important in experiments with groups of biological and electronic neurons interconnected with each other .",
    "living neurons , even taken from the same biological structure , may generate considerably different waveforms .",
    "the relative size of spikes and the interburst hyperpolarization is variable from cell to cell . in our circuits",
    "we can precisely adjust the waveform of the en to be very close to that of each biological neuron in our experiments .",
    "another reason to use circuits with variable waveforms is that it opens up the possibility of studying how the action potential waveforms affect the interactions among the neurons , electronic and biological .",
    "indeed , the ability to vary the details of the waveforms provides an interesting handle on design of biometric circuitry for a variety of applications .",
    "in living nervous systems one finds three general types of synaptic connections among neurons  @xcite : ohmic electrical connections ( also called gap junctions ) and two types of chemical connections , excitatory and inhibitory . for our studies of the interconnections among ens and among ens and biological neurons  @xcite , we built electronic circuits to emulate excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections as well as the ohmic electrical connections .",
    "the stg neural circuits are dominated by inhibitory interconnections and by ohmic electrical connections .",
    "we now describe how we implemented each , and then we turn to the results of our synchronization experiments with these network connections .",
    "we implemented an electrical synapse  @xcite between the ens by injecting into one of the neurons ( @xmath36 ) a current proportional to the voltage difference between the two membrane potentials of the ens and into the other neuron ( @xmath37 ) injecting the same current but with the opposite strength .",
    "the current into @xmath36 is    @xmath38 + while @xmath39    we chose the dimensionless synaptic strength @xmath40 in the range @xmath41 .",
    "$ ] over this range we observed the effects of positive and negative electrical coupling on the spiking and bursting behavior of the ens .",
    "we recorded the electrical voltage signals corresponding to the membrane potentials of the ens using an analog to digital converter with a sampling rate of 5 khz . for each value of @xmath40 we waited at least 40 seconds to avoid transient dynamics and then recorded a data series 20 seconds long .",
    "natural biological networks do not have negative conductance electrical coupling .",
    "using an active device placed between the neurons we implemented negative electrical couplings in our experiments on two electrically coupled biological neurons as reported in  @xcite .",
    "to compare the results of our work there with the properties of coupled ens , we use negative coupling here as well .",
    "we first implemented mutual chemical synapses between the two ens using analog circuitry . here",
    "we report on results obtained by using a software implementation of the chemical synapses which allows to investigate the role of the synaptic time constant @xmath42 . in the analog circuit implementation of the chemical synapses we need to replace a capacitor every time we want to change the time constant , but in the software version",
    "this time constant is just a parameter , so it is easier to study the role of these time constant in the software version . in this paper",
    "the time constant is fixed , and our observations on the role of a changing time constant will be reported in another paper .",
    "the results using a software version of the chemical synapse , and the results using our hardware version were identical .",
    "we used the nonlinear amplifiers to reshape the signals corresponding to the membrane potential of the ens in such a way that the new signals had amplitudes , spike / burst ratios , and voltage offsets close to the the signals generated by living neurons . with these reshaped signals we used new dynamic clamp software  @xcite to generate in real time the currents corresponding to the graded chemical synapses",
    "as described the by first - order kinetics    @xmath43    and @xmath44 where @xmath45,\\ ] ] when @xmath46",
    ". otherwise @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath48 is the maximal synaptic conductance , @xmath49 , the instantaneous synaptic activation , @xmath50 , the steady - state synaptic activation , @xmath51 , the synaptic reversal potential , and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the presynaptic and postsynaptic voltages respectively .",
    "@xmath42 is the synaptic time constant , @xmath54 , the synaptic threshold voltage , and @xmath55 , the synaptic slope voltage .",
    "the synaptic reversal potentials were selected so that the currents injected into the postsynaptic ens were always negative for inhibitory synapses and positive for excitatory synapses , emulating the biological synapses  @xcite .",
    "the synaptic threshold voltages were set in the middle of the amplitude of the bursts , and the synaptic slope voltage was adjusted to make the output of the hyperbolic tangent slightly saturated at the spikes . in our experiments @xmath48 was varied as we collected different data sets .",
    "we used standard values for the other parameters in the dynamic clamp program : @xmath56 ( inhibitory synapses ) or @xmath57 ( excitatory synapses ) ; @xmath58 ; @xmath59 ; and @xmath60 .",
    "as before we waited for at least 40 seconds after connecting the ens with the chemical synapses before starting the recording of the 20 seconds of data from the membrane potential of the ens .",
    "to analyze the degree of synchronization of slow bursts between two coupled neurons ( electrically or chemically ) we proceed in the same manner as we used for our experiments on synchronized living neurons  @xcite .",
    "this was based on a method developed for the experimental studies of synchronization of chaotic oscillations in electronic circuits  @xcite .",
    "we used an overlap - add method of fir filtering with a hamming window , and used an fft and a cutoff frequency of 5hz to suppress the spikes , obtaining the filtered data series @xmath61 ; @xmath62 .",
    "the synchronization of the ens is quantified by calculating the difference @xmath63 , and studying the normalized standard deviation @xmath64 and the normalized maximal deviation @xmath65 as a function of @xmath40 for the electrical coupling or as a function of @xmath48 for the chemical coupling . for notational convenience ,",
    "we indicate excitatory couplings with values of @xmath66 and inhibitory couplings with values of @xmath67 .",
    "the parameters of the isolated neurons were set in the chaotic spiking - bursting regime .",
    "an example of the behavior of an isolated en is shown in figure  [ free ] .",
    "note that the scale for @xmath15 is double that of the numerical simulations shown in figure  [ 4dphases ] because of the rescaling time constant in the analog integrator ( see section  [ electronicneurons ] ) .",
    "the relative behavior of the spikes and slow oscillations can be seen in the plots of @xmath68 vs. @xmath69 ( figure  [ free]a ) and @xmath70 vs. @xmath71 ( figure  [ free]b ) , respectively .",
    "we began with electrical coupling between two four dimensional analog circuit models implementing equation([eq : hrmodel ] ) .",
    "we varied only @xmath72 keeping all other parameters fixed .",
    "a convenient representation of the range of behavior we observed is presented in figure  [ mapel ] . here ,",
    "overlying values of @xmath73 and @xmath74 we give a verbal description of the quantitative behavior of time series in each regime .",
    "to illustrate the phenomena seen in each regime @xmath75 $ ] of figure  [ mapel ] we show examples of the time series for the membrane potentials @xmath76 of the two neurons in figures  [ posel ] and  [ negel ] .",
    "* when @xmath78 the two neurons are uncoupled and display independent chaotic oscillations as shown in figure  [ free ] .",
    "* for small , positive coupling @xmath79 , regions of nearly independent chaotic spiking - bursting activity are observed as well as some regions of synchronized bursting activity as shown in figure  [ posel](b ) where we set @xmath80 .",
    "there is a small range of @xmath81 @xmath82 in which intermittent anti - phase bursting behavior can be found .",
    "the burst length in this case is kept nearly regular from burst to burst as shown in figure  [ posel](a ) . * for @xmath83 the behavior is still chaotic for the two neurons but most of the bursts are synchronized as shown in figure  [ posel](c ) where we set @xmath84 . * from @xmath85 the bursting activity becomes regular going from a region in which there is partial synchronization ( spikes not synchronized ) , as shown in figure  [ posel](d ) where we set @xmath86 , to a region of total synchronization ( bursts and spikes synchronized ) , shown in figure  [ posel](e ) where we set @xmath87 . * from @xmath88 there is total synchronization in the spiking - bursting activity , and the oscillations are chaotic as shown in figure  [ posel](f ) where we set @xmath89 .",
    "+ results for @xmath90 * for negative coupling @xmath91 , the oscillations are predominantly chaotic and the hyperpolarizing regions , where the membrane voltage is quite negative , of the signals are all in anti - phase .",
    "the average burst length decreases as the coupling becomes stronger as shown in figure  [ negel ] . for a small range of @xmath40 @xmath92 very long bursts",
    "were observed as shown in figure  [ negel](a ) .",
    "@xmath73 and @xmath74 provide quantitative measures of the synchronization between two ens . in our report on the experimental work  @xcite with two biological cells ,",
    "the results for @xmath73 and @xmath93 can be seen in figure 5 of that paper .",
    "note that , as in the case of coupled biological neurons , we have here a bifurcation between positive and negative electrical coupling . in the experimental work on electrically coupled biological neurons a value for the external coupling @xmath94ns serves to null out the natural coupling of about that amount , so the figures here and in the earlier paper are to be compared by sliding @xmath95 here to @xmath96ns there . both in the biological and electronic experiments , the sharp phase transition from very small @xmath97 for positive coupling to large , nearly constant values is associated with the rather rapid change from nearly and then fully synchronous behavior for positive couplings to out - of - phase oscillations for negative couplings .    the @xmath73 and @xmath74 curves in the paper on coupled biological neurons  @xcite shows far fewer points and consequently less detail that our curves for coupled 4d ens .",
    "clearly this is because of the resolution in the biological experiments and the difficulty in performing experiments at such closely chosen values of @xmath98 . at this time",
    "the details of behavior revealed in the present experiments on ens have not been verified in the biological setting .",
    "one should view our figure  [ mapel ] and figure 5 of  @xcite as in excellent qualitative agreement .",
    "we have observed the behavior of two four dimensional ens coupled with _",
    "identical _ chemical synapses .",
    "two electrical versions of chemical synapses were built with identical parameters and then used to coupled two four dimensional ens . in the equations ,",
    "equation ( [ chemsynapse ] ) , we integrate to represent the chemical synapse , all parameters were set equal in the two connecting circuits .",
    "we then varied @xmath99 in each chemical synapse over the range @xmath100 for an excitatory synapse , namely @xmath57 , and over the range @xmath101 for an inhibitory synapse , namely , @xmath102 .",
    "the other parameters were held fixed at @xmath103 , and @xmath60 . in figure  [ mapchem ]",
    "we collect the statistical results , expressed in our usual quantities @xmath104 and @xmath105 , for both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections .",
    "negative values of @xmath99 represent inhibitory connections .",
    "this , perhaps apparently peculiar , method of presentation allows us to see immediately the relationship between excitatory and inhibitory interconnections . as earlier with electrical couplings we provide a verbal description of each region of behavior over the whole range of @xmath99 .",
    "we show examples of the time series for the membrane potential @xmath15 of the two neurons in figure  [ exchem ] and figure  [ inchem ] .      when coupled with implementations of excitatory chemical",
    "synapses the ens displayed the following behaviors :    * when @xmath106 the two neurons are uncoupled and display independent chaotic oscillations as shown in figure  [ free ] . * for positive coupling @xmath107 a transition from the chaotic behavior to regular spiking / bursting",
    "is observed . for small coupling the independent chaotic spiking / bursting activity of the uncoupled neurons",
    "is replaced by a behavior in which most of the bursts are synchronized , but the oscillations are still chaotic as shown in figure  [ exchem](a ) for @xmath108 .",
    "as @xmath48 is increased all the bursts become synchronized , and the activity becomes periodic as shown in figure  [ exchem](b ) for @xmath109 . * for @xmath110 the bursts remain synchronized and get longer , but there are no longer any spikes during the bursts as shown in figure  [ exchem](c ) for @xmath111 .",
    "finally we report on our experiments with an electronic version of an inhibitory chemical synapse .",
    "this inhibitory synaptic coupling occurs in the lobster pyloric cpg as well as many other cpgs , and we have suggested  @xcite that inhibitory chemical coupling will lead to regularization of the chaotic oscillations of the individual neurons .",
    "* for small @xmath48 the oscillations are still chaotic , but all of the hyperpolarizing regions of the membrane voltages are in anti - phase as shown in figure  [ inchem](a ) for @xmath112 .",
    "* when @xmath113 the oscillations become periodic , and all the hyperpolarizing regions are in out - of - phase as shown in figure  [ inchem](b ) .",
    "* for @xmath114 the out - of - phase behavior of the hyperpolarizing regions remains , but the oscillations are chaotic again as shown in figure  [ inchem](c ) for @xmath115 . * for @xmath116 the oscillations regularize again , and the behavior is periodic with out - of - phase bursting as shown in figure  [ inchem](d ) for @xmath117 and in figure  [ inchem](e ) for @xmath118 . * for @xmath119 the oscillations are chaotic and long out - of - phase bursts are observed as shown in figure  [ inchem](f ) for @xmath120 .",
    "the only experiments we know which relate to these observations on two chemically coupled ens are not a precise match , but bear noting .",
    "r. elson   @xcite has isolated a pair of lp and pd neurons from the lobster pyloric cpg ; these have mutual inhibitory coupling .",
    "elson varied the strength of the chemical coupling using neuromodulators and making measurements at four values of @xmath99 over a nominal rage of 20 ns to 60 ns .",
    "he observed only the behavior reported in the penultimate item of our experiments on inhibitory coupling .",
    "unfortunately , control of the identity of the mutual inhibitory couplings was not possible , nor was it possible for us to directly compare the calibration of elson s indication of the magnitude of @xmath99 with our own choices in using ens .",
    "to date then , we have no direct laboratory evidence on synchronization of biological neurons mutually coupled with chemical synapses .",
    "this is in contrast to our observations on electrically coupled biological neurons  @xcite .",
    "this represents an interesting opportunity for biological experiments which may be directly compared to our results using ens .",
    "we have previously reported experiments on replacing the ab neuron from the pyloric cpg in its interaction with an isolated pair of pd neurons with a * three dimensional * en  @xcite .",
    "for completeness in light of the work reported in this paper , we carried out an experiment in which one of our four dimensional neurons was coupled bidirectionally to one of the pd neurons in the ab / pd pacemaker group of the pyloric cpg .",
    "the full description of the methods used in the biological preparation will appear elsewhere  @xcite , but here we quite briefly summarize those points important to the main thrusts of this article .",
    "these experiments were carried out on one of the two pyloric dilator ( pd ) neurons from the pyloric central pattern generator ( cpg ) of the lobster stomatogastric ganglion ( stg )  @xcite .",
    "the stg of the california spiny lobster , _ panulirus interruptus , _ was removed using standard procedures and pinned out in a dish lined with silicone elastomer and filled with normal lobster saline .",
    "the stg was isolated from its associated anterior ganglia , which provide activating inputs , by cutting the stomatogastric nerve .",
    "two glass microelectrodes were inserted in the soma of the pd neuron : one for intracellular voltage recording and another one for current injection .",
    "the voltage signals were digitized at 10000 samples / sec .",
    "the two pd neurons remained coupled to each other and to the autonomously bursting interneuron ( ab ) by their natural electrical synapses , but were isolated from the rest of the cpg by blocking chemical input synapses with picrotoxin @xmath121 .",
    "the artificial electrical coupling was provided by injecting in the en and in the pd opposite currents .",
    "more details of the experimental setup can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the membrane voltage of the en was reshaped to make its amplitude ratio in spiking / bursting mode , its total amplitude and its voltage offset similar to those of the pd neuron . only electrical coupling , positive and negative ,",
    "is reported here .",
    "we connected the neurons with the analog electrical synapse and observed their spiking - bursting behavior as shown in figure  [ hybrid ] . when uncoupled , the neurons had independent spiking / bursting activity as shown in figure  [ hybrid](b ) .",
    "for large enough negative coupling the neurons are synchronized and fire out - of - phase as shown in figure  [ hybrid](a ) . for positive coupling the neurons show synchronized bursting activity as shown in figure  [ hybrid](c ) . for this value of @xmath98",
    "the bursts are synchronized but not the spikes .",
    "this result is in agreement with the experiments made with a pair of electrically coupled ens , as we discussed above , as well as for a pair of living stg neurons  @xcite .",
    "the ens described in this paper are simple analog circuits which integrate four dimensional differential equations representing fast and slow subcellular processes that give rise to the characteristic spiking and spiking - bursting behavior of cpg neurons .",
    "the single neurons can be easily set into a chaotic regime that reproduces the irregular firing patterns observed in biological neurons when isolated from the rest of the cpg .",
    "this study comprises : ( a ) two electrically coupled ens and ( b ) two ens connected with excitatory and inhibitory chemical synapses .",
    "these two types of connections exist in almost all known cpgs .",
    "the range of observations summarized in figures  [ mapel ] and  [ mapchem ] shows the rich behavior and complexity of these minimal network configurations .",
    "it indicates how small changes in the coupling conductance can drive the cells into completely different regimes .",
    "in particular , some of our experiments predict the appearance of chaotic out - of - phase synchronization for different coupling configurations .",
    "these results are displayed in figures  [ negel]c and  [ inchem]f . in general , the experiments with the ens contribute directly to our understanding of the origin of regularization of individually chaotic neurons through cooperative activity .",
    "how complicated should one require a model neuron to be ?",
    "in our view the answer depends on the neural function one wishes to represent .",
    "the analysis of the electrical activity of isolated neurons from the lobster pyloric cpg indicates that the number of active degrees of freedom is not very large , ranging from three to five in various environments , and this suggests a very simple representation in terms of dynamical equations .",
    "our analysis  @xcite of much richer hodgkin - huxley models of these individual neural oscillators also indicates that in the regime of biological operation , the number of active degrees of freedom is equally small . on this basis",
    "we developed the hindmarsh - rose type models of these neurons both in numerical simulation and in analog electrical circuitry .",
    "this paper has moved that inquiry about the complexity of representation for the components of a biologically realistic neural network to another level .",
    "here we have investigated whether the simplified neural models , when coupled together in small networks , but in biologically realistic manners , can reproduce our observations biological neurons alone . the striking result of the observations presented here , when the experimental setup matches that of the biological networks , is that the observed behavior of the ens also matches .",
    "further , using our ens , we are able to make distinct predictions about the behavior of biological or hybrid ( biological and en ) networks in settings not yet investigated .",
    "our experiments on coupled biological neurons and ens provide further ground for testing the validity of numerical and electronic models of individual neural behavior as well as presenting interesting new examples of coupled nonlinear oscillators .",
    "hybrid circuits with biological and electronic neurons coupled together are a powerful mechanism to understand the modes of operation of cpgs .",
    "the hybrid system constitutes an easy way to change the connectivity and global topology of the cpg .",
    "the roles of intrinsic dynamics of the neurons and the synaptic properties of the network in rhythm generation can be easily studied with these hybrid configurations   @xcite ) .",
    "there are previous efforts studying electronic neurons alone and in conjunction with biological neurons .",
    "an early example is the work of yarom   @xcite where a network of four oscillators , realized as an analog circuit , was interfaced with an olivary neuron in a slice preparation .",
    "yarom studied the response of the olivary neuron when it received oscillating electrical input from the network .",
    "there was no feedback from the biological neuron to the network he constructed .",
    "le masson , et al  @xcite developed a digital version of a neuron comprising a hodgkin - huxley  @xcite ( hh ) model of various pyloric cpg neurons with three compartments and eight different ion channels which ran on a dsp board located on the bus of a personal computer .",
    "they connected this model into a variety of different configurations of subcircuits of the pyloric cpg replacing at various times the lp , a pd or a py neuron .",
    "using this ` hybrid ' setup they verified that many aspects of the pyloric rhythm are accurately reproduced when their dsp based neuron replaces one of the biological neurons in their system . in subsequent work",
    "@xcite , this group has developed vlsi devices for integrating the hh models and has utilized them in mixed circuits ( ens and biological neurons ) , replacing the dsp version of the conductance models in their biological preparations .",
    "the complexity of these ens has not been needed in our modeling nor in the further experiments on their interaction with each other as reported here .",
    "we have not found any reports in the literature on the mutual interaction of these analog vlsi neural circuits .",
    "there are two interesting directions to which the results reported here may point :    * \\(1 ) biologically realistic neural networks of much greater size than the elementary ones investigated here may be efficiently investigated numerically or in analog circuitry using the realistic , but simple hr type models .",
    "the integration of the model equations is no challenge to easily available computing power and large networks should be amenable to investigation and analysis . * \\(2 ) the networks investigated here are subcircuits of a biological circuit of about fifteen neurons which has the functional role of a control system : commands are presented from other ganglia of the lobster and this pyloric circuit must express voltage activity to the muscles to operate a pump for shredded food passing from the stomach to the digestive system .",

    "the component neurons may seem attractive at one level , but the results presented here suggest that many interesting questions may be asked of those networks using the simplified component neurons studied here .",
