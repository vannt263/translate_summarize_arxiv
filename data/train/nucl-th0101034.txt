    "exclusive ( @xmath2 ) knockout reactions represent a very clean tool to explore the single - particle ( s.p . ) aspects of nuclear structure revealing the properties of proton - hole states contained in the hole spectral function  @xcite .",
    "several high - resolution experiments were carried out at saclay  @xcite and nikhef  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the missing energy and momentum dependence of the experimental cross sections allowed to assign specific quantum numbers and spectroscopic factors to the peaks in the energy spectrum .",
    "the calculations for this analysis were carried out with the program dweepy  @xcite , within the theoretical framework of a nonrelativistic distorted wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) , where final - state interactions ( fsi ) and coulomb distortion of the electron wave functions are taken into account .",
    "phenomenological ingredients were used to compute bound and scattering states .",
    "the outgoing nucleon scattering wave functions are eigenfunctions of an optical potential determined through a fit to elastic nucleon - nucleus scattering data including cross sections and polarizations .",
    "bound - state wave functions were calculated with a woods - saxon well , where the radius was determined to fit the experimental momentum distributions and the depth was adjusted to give the experimentally observed separation energy of the bound final state .",
    "this theoretical approach was able to describe , with a high degree of accuracy , in a wide range of nuclei and in different kinematics , the shape of the experimental momentum distributions at missing - energy values corresponding to specific peaks in the energy spectrum . in order to reproduce the size of the experimental cross sections ,",
    "the normalization of the bound - state wave function was fitted to the data and identified with the spectroscopic factor .",
    "these values , however , are smaller than those predicted by many - body theories .",
    "similar models based on a fully relativistic dwia ( rdwia ) framework were developed in more recent years  @xcite . in these approaches",
    "the bound nucleons are described by s.p .",
    "dirac wave functions in the presence of scalar and vector potentials fitted to the ground - state properties of the nucleus , and the scattering wave function is solution of the dirac equation with relativistic optical potentials obtained by fitting elastic proton - nucleus scattering data . some of these approaches include also an exact treatment of the coulomb distortion of the electron waves  @xcite .",
    "also rdwia analyses were able to give a good description of the experimental momentum distributions .",
    "thus , the shape of the distributions in dwia and rdwia calculations are similar , while the spectroscopic factors , obtained by scaling the calculated cross sections to the data , are in rdwia about @xmath3% larger than in dwia analyses , and thus closer to theoretical predictions .",
    "the difference was attributed to the relativistic optical potential , which leads to stronger absorption .",
    "the nucleon - nucleus interaction exhibits characteristic non - localities which arise quite naturally in the dirac approach and whose effect was not included in standard nonrelativistic dwia calculations , but can be accounted for in the nonrelativistic treatment by a renormalization of the scattering wave function .",
    "the so - called darwin normalization factor  @xcite , that essentially changes the schrdinger wave function into the upper component of the dirac wave function , increases the absorption due to fsi and produces a quenching of the calculated cross section by about 15% , with a corresponding enhancement of the spectroscopic factor in agreement with the results obtained in rdwia .",
    "new data have recently become available from tjnaf .",
    "the cross section for quasielastic @xmath4-shell proton knockout has been measured and the response functions and the asymmetry have been extracted in the @xmath1o(@xmath2 ) reaction at four - momentum transfer squared @xmath5 ( gev/@xmath6)@xmath7 and energy transfer @xmath8 mev  @xcite . in the same kinematics also",
    "first polarization transfer measurements have been carried out for the @xmath1o(@xmath9 ) reaction  @xcite .",
    "the polarization of the ejected proton in the @xmath10c(@xmath11 ) reaction has been measured at bates with @xmath12 ( gev/@xmath6)@xmath7 and outgoing - proton energy @xmath13 mev  @xcite .    the analysis of these new data in kinematic conditions unaccessible in previous experiments , where @xmath14 was less than 0.4 ( gev/@xmath6)@xmath7 and @xmath15 generally around 100 mev , requires a theoretical treatment where all relativistic effects are carefully and consistently included .",
    "indeed these recent data are well described by rdwia calculations@xcite .",
    "fully relativistic models based on the rdwia have been developed by different groups  @xcite .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the hadronic part of the relativistic transition amplitude can be written in terms of schrdinger - like wave functions for bound and scattering states and of an effective nuclear current operator which contains the dirac potentials . in this way",
    ", complications due to the solution of the dirac equation can be avoided and spinor distortion can be accounted for solving a relativized schrdinger equation , of the same type as that solved in ordinary nonrelativistic dwia calculations with nonrelativistic or relativistic equivalent potentials , but dirac scalar and vector potentials appear in the nuclear current operator .",
    "this so - called effective pauli reduction does not represent an approximation .",
    "it is in principle exact and can be considered an alternative fully relativistic approach .",
    "this approach was adopted in refs .",
    "@xcite with an effective momentum approximation ( ema ) to incorporate spinor distortion into the effective current operator . in this approximation",
    "the momentum operators in the term @xmath16 , appearing in the lower components of the dirac spinor and in the effective current operator , are replaced by their asymptotic values .",
    "this model contains approximations , but accounts for all the main relativistic effects and is able to give a good description of the most recent experimental results .",
    "the spectroscopic factor extracted in comparison with @xmath1o(@xmath2 ) data for @xmath4-shell proton knockout is the same as in other rdwia analyses , i.e. 0.7  @xcite .",
    "both nonrelativistic dwia and rdwia models are able to describe , with a good degree of accuracy , the ( @xmath2 ) data at low energies , but the nonrelativistic dwia approach is more flexible .",
    "some relativistic corrections can be included in a nonrelativistic treatment , but a fully relativistic model is needed for the analysis of the data at higher energies that are now becoming available .",
    "it is thus important to establish a clear relationship between the nonrelativistic dwia treatment that was extensively used in the analysis of low - energy data and rdwia treatments , in order to understand the relevance of genuine relativistic effects and the limit of validity of the nonrelativstic model .",
    "relativistic effects as well as the differences between relativistic and norelativistic calculations have been widely and carefully investigated in different papers where rdwia treatments have been developed .",
    "the differences , however , were usually investigated starting from the basis of a relativistic model where terms corresponding to relativistic effects are cancelled , such as , for instance , the lower components in the dirac spinor and the darwin factor , or where nonrelativistic approximations are included .",
    "although very interesting , these investigations do not correspond to the result of a direct and consistent comparison between rdwia and the dwia calculations carried out with the program dweepy , that was used in the analysis of low - energy data .",
    "in fact , dweepy is based on a nonrelativistic treatment where some relativistic corrections are introduced : a relativistic kinematics is adopted and relativistic corrections at the lowest order in the inverse nucleon mass are included in the nuclear current operator  @xcite , which is derived from the foldy - wouthuysen transformation  @xcite .",
    "the darwin factor can be simply included in a nonrelativistic treatment  @xcite , but it was not explicitly considered in the data analyses carried out with dweepy .",
    "only indirect comparison between relativistic and norelativistic calculations can be obtained from the available data analyses carried out with dweepy and in rdwia .",
    "in fact , the two types of calculations make generally use of different optical potentials and bound state wave functions , and the difference due to the different theoretical ingredients can not be attributed to relativity .",
    "this problem was already clear in previous investigations of relativistic effects .",
    "various attempts were made to reproduce the conditions of a nonrelativistic calculation from a relativistic approach , but a consistent and direct comparison has not yet been achieved .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to make clear the relationship between the dwia approach in dweepy and rdwia treatments , and to investigate the relevance of genuine relativistic effects through a direct comparison between the results of the two calculations .",
    "a fully relativistic rdwia treatment of the ( @xmath2 ) knockout reaction has thus been developed .",
    "the effective pauli reduction  @xcite has been adopted for the scattering state .",
    "for the bound state the numerical solution of the dirac equation has been used , as in this case it does not represent a too difficult problem .",
    "various computer programs are in fact available , able to explain the global and s.p .",
    "properties of a nucleus within the framework of a relativistic mean - field theory . for the scattering state , where a partial - wave expansion is performed",
    ", the effective pauli reduction appears simpler and more flexible , and it is equivalent to the solution of the dirac equation . from this point of view ,",
    "our relativistic approach does not contain approximations , since the schrdinger - like equation is solved for each partial wave starting from a relativistic optical potential and without assuming the ema prescription in the effective current operator .",
    "the numerical results of this rdwia model have been compared with the results of dweepy .",
    "a consistent comparison requires the same kinematical conditions and the use of consistent theoretical ingredients in the two calculations .",
    "thus , in dweepy we have adopted for the bound state the normalized upper component of the dirac spinor and for the scattering state the solution of the same schrdinger - equivalent optical potential of the relativistic calculation .",
    "different kinematics have been considered for the comparison , with the aim to investigate the relevance of relativistic effects not included in dweepy in different situations , at low energy , in the kinematical region where dweepy was extensively and successfully applied , and at higher energy , where relativistic effects are more evident , in order to establish the limit of validity of the nonrelativistic approach .",

    "in the one - photon exchange approximation , where a photon is exchanged between the incident electron and the target nucleus , the coincidence cross section of the ( @xmath2 ) reaction is given by the contraction between the lepton tensor , dependent only on the electron variables and completely determined by qed , and the hadron tensor , whose components are given by bilinear products of the transition matrix elements of the nuclear current operator . according to the impulse approximation , in which only one nucleon of the target is involved in the reaction , the nuclear current is assumed to be a one - body operator .    in rdwia the matrix elements of the nuclear current operator , i.e. @xmath17 are calculated with relativistic wave functions for initial bound and final scattering states .",

    "the reduction increases with the outgoing proton energy , and , at a given values of @xmath15 , is larger at positive @xmath90 , when the momentum transfer decreases .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that the leading term of the spin current , proportional to @xmath28 , is the same in the relativistic and nonrelativistic expressions .      in this section",
    "we shall discuss the effect of the optical potential in the pauli reduction of the four - component dirac spinor for the scattering state .",
    "we do not discuss the corresponding effect on the bound state , as in our calculations the bound - state wave function is taken directly from the solution of the relativistic dirac equation .",

    "thus , at higher energies , where @xmath97 becomes larger than @xmath99 , the effect of spinor distortion on the cross section decreases .      in this section the validity of ema is discussed .",

    "( [ eq.comcor ] ) .",
    "it is exact in plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) , where the scattering wave functions are eigenfunctions of the momentum , but in dwia it disregards the spreading of the distorted proton wave function in momentum space due to fsi .",

    "@xcite for bound and scattering states .",
    "since in our approach the bound - state wave function is taken directly from the solution of the dirac equation , we investigate the validity of ema only for the scattering state .",
    "we have to notice that in our calculations ema does not change the nuclear current operator , which is calculated with the _ cc2 _ formula and therefore does not depend on the momentum .",
    "the only dependence is contained in the pauli reduction of the scattering wave function .",
    "the effect of ema in our rdwia approach is shown in figs . 9 and 10 , where the the structure functions and the cross section calculated with ema in the kinematics with constant ( @xmath104 ) at @xmath15 = 100 mev are displayed and compared with the exact result . at 100 mev",
    "the difference is indeed sensible , but it rapidly decreases with the energy . at 200 mev",
    "it is much smaller , and becomes really negligible at @xmath94 400 mev , and therefore at the energy of the tjnaf experiment .",

    "low - energy data are presented in terms of the reduced cross section  @xcite , which is defined as the cross section divided by a kinematical factor and the elementary off - shell electron - proton scattering cross section , usually @xmath106 of ref .",

    "[ fig.leu ] the reduced cross sections measured at nikhef  @xcite for the @xmath1o(@xmath2 ) knockout reaction and for the transitions to the @xmath107 ground state and the @xmath108 excited state of @xmath85n are displayed and compared with the results given by our rdwia program and by dweepy .",
    "the experiment was carried out in parallel kinematics at @xmath15  =  90 mev .",
    "the relativistic results are lower than the nonrelativistic ones and the corresponding spectroscopic factors are approximately 10% larger than those deduced from nonrelativistic analyses .",
    "thus , the normalization ( spectroscopic ) factor , applied in fig .",
    "[ fig.leu ] to the calculated results in order to reproduce the size of the experimental data , is 0.70 for rdwia and 0.65 for dweepy .",
    "the same value is adopted for the two final states .    as we already stated in sec .",
    "[ sec.3 ] , only small differences are found at this proton energy between the two models .",
    "thus , the results of the two calculations are almost equivalent in comparison with data , which are reasonably described by both calculations .",
    "a better agreement is found for the @xmath107 than for the @xmath108 state . in any case , it is not as good as in the dwia analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite performed with dweepy .",
    "this result is expected , as we already claimed that the theoretical ingredients , bound state and optical potential , used in the present calculation do not represent the best choice for dweepy , but are here adopted in order to allow a consistent comparison between the relativistic and nonrelativtsic approaches .    in figs .",
    "[ fig.gaocs1][fig.gaor3 ] the cross sections and the structure functions measured at tjnaf  @xcite for the @xmath1o(@xmath2 ) knockout reaction and for the transitions to the @xmath107 ground state and the @xmath108 excited state of @xmath85n are displayed and compared with the results of our rdwia model .",
    "the experiment was carried out in a kinematics with constant ( @xmath104 ) , with @xmath109 2.4 gev and @xmath110 439 mev .",
    "only rdwia calculations are shown in the figure , since we know from the investigation of sec .",
    "[ sec.3 ] that at the proton energy of this experiment relativistic effects are large and a relativistic analysis is necessary .",
    "in order to study the sensitivity to different optical potentials , we compare in the figures results obtained with the edad1 and edai - o fits of ref .",
    "only small differences are given by the two optical potentials .",
    "the agreement with data is satisfactory and of about the same quality as in other rdwia analyses , but for the interference structure function @xmath100 for the @xmath107 state at intermediate missing momenta . a better description of data might be obtained with a more careful determination of the theoretical ingredients .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the spectroscopic factor applied to all the calculatations in figs .",
    "[ fig.gaocs1][fig.gaor3 ] is the same , i.e. 0.7 , as that found in the comparison with nikhef data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.leu ] . a spectroscopic factor of about 0.7 was also obtained in previous rdwia analyses of the same tjnaf data  @xcite .",
    "the induced polarization of the outgoing proton @xmath113 was measured at bates for the @xmath10c(@xmath11 ) reaction  @xcite .",

    "[ fig.bates ] these data are displayed and compared with our rdwia calculations .",
    "results obtained with the edad1 and edai - c optical potentials are compared in the figure .",
    "the edad1 curve gives a better description of the experimental data at high values of the missing momentum , but both calculations are in fair agreement with data .",
    "with edad1 potential , we also plot results after eliminating the negative energy components in the bound state .    as already shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the polarization @xmath113 is enhanced by the presence of the negative energy components of the relativistic bound state wave function . this result",
    "is confirmed in fig .",

    "in order to clarify the differences between the usual nonrelativistic approach and a relativistic description of exclusive @xmath115 knockout reactions , we have performed a fully relativistic calculation and compared it with the nonrelativistic results of the dweepy code , that was successfully used to analyse a large number of experimental data .",
    "the transition matrix element of the nuclear current operator is written in rdwia using the relativistic bound state wave functions obtained in the framework of the mean field theory , and the direct pauli reduction method with scalar and vector potentials for the ejectile wave functions .",
    "correspondingly , the nonrelativistic dwia matrix elements are computed in a consistent way to allow a direct comparison with the relativistic results .",
    "the main aim of this paper was not to make a precise analysis of the existing experimental data , but to discuss the use of a nonrelativistic approach at energies higher than those generally considered up to few years ago , and to clarify the possible relativistic effects arising also at lower energies .",
    "we have used the new rdwia and dweepy codes to perform calculations for several kinematical conditions .",
    "the relativistic results are always smaller than the nonrelativistic ones and the difference increases with energy .",
    "the transverse and interference structure functions are particularly sensitive to relativistic effects , much more than the longitudinal structure function .",
    "@xmath97 is sensibly reduced even at low energy : inclusion of higher order terms in the nonrelativistic nuclear current can reduce the difference , but a fully relativistic calculation is necessary above @xmath116 200 mev .    the effect of the scalar and vector potentials in the pauli reduction for the scattering state has been discussed .",
    "these potentials appear in the relativistic treatment and are absent in the nonrelativistic one .",
    "the combined contribution of the reduction due to the darwin factor and of spinor distortion , which enhances the effects of the lower components of the dirac spinor , is always small .",
    "the validity of ema in the scattering state of relativistic calculations has been studied .",
    "the differences with respect to the exact results are sensible at @xmath15 = 100 mev , but rapidly decrease with the energy and become negligible at @xmath116 400 mev .",
    "we have tested our new rdwia calculations in comparison with experimental data that have already been described by other models .",
    "the agreement is satisfactory and comparable with other relativistic analyses .",
