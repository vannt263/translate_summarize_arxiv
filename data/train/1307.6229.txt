    "quantum game theory is a study of the well established field of classical game theory in the light of the principals of quantum mechanics .",
    "it exploits the remarkable properties of quantum mechanics , the entanglement and the quantum phases , to get results that are classically impossible . for a little more than one decade , quantum game theorists are involved to study the behavior of classical games in the domain of quantum mechanics under different circumstances .",
    "a number of classical games have been quantized and the effects of entanglement on the payoff of the players have been studied .",
    "subsequent to the work of meyer @xcite , it has been shown by many authors that quantum players can outsmart the classical counterparts by using quantum mechanical strategies [ 2 - 13 ] .",
    "the entanglement between spatially separated parties is the mere powerful source of performing various quantum information and quantum computation processes .",
    "its behavior in relativistic setup in noninertial frames is presently under exploration .",
    "the existing studies in the noninertial frames show that the unruh effect degrades the entanglement between different modes of various fields that may or may not vanish in the limit of infinite acceleration @xcite .",
    "the studies of the effect of environment on entanglement in noninertial frames @xcite shows that the decoherence quickens the loss of entanglement in many cases , nevertheless , under particular conditions the entanglement rebirth may happen @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the effect of environment and of unruh effect on the payoffs function of the players in the quantum prisoners dilemma eisert .",
    "the effect of environment is incorporated using amplitude damping noise .",
    "we show that for a factorizable initial state and fully decohered game , the acceleration of the frame become irrelevant and the payoff matrix reduces to the classical symmetric payoff matrix .",
    "the local environment of stationary observer has no effect on the payoff function of the players . for maximally entangled initial state",
    ", the strategy profiles ( @xmath0 ) and ( @xmath1 ) become pareto inefficient when the game is fully decohered .",

    "the left number in each pair of the matrix represents alice s payoff and the right number in a pair stands for bob s payoff .",
    "this is a symmetric noncooperative game where each player tries to maximize his / her own payoff .",
    "the catch of the dilemma is that @xmath7 is the dominant strategy , that is , rational reasoning forces each player to defect , and thereby doing substantially worse than if they would both decide to cooperate .",

    "( [ e1 ] ) , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) kets represent the vacuum and the excited states from the perspective of an inertial observer .",
    "we consider that both the players carry devices that are sensitive to their respective modes @xmath27 . after sharing these modes ,",
    "bob then moves with a uniform acceleration and alice stays stationary .",
    "the suitable coordinates for accelerated observers are rindler coordinates , which define two causally disconnected rindler regions ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "that is , a uniformly accelerated observer in region @xmath29 has no access to information that leaks to region @xmath30 and vice versa ( for detail see @xcite and reference therein ) . a given minkowski mode of a particular frequency spreads over all positive rindler frequencies that peaks about the minkowski frequency @xcite .",
    "however , to simplify our problem we consider a single mode only in the rindler region @xmath29 , which is valid if the observers detectors are highly monochromatic that detects the frequency @xmath31 . from this point",
    "onward , with this approximation , the frequency subscript of kets will be dropped .",
    "from the perspective of accelerated frame , the minkowski vacuum state is a two mode squeezed state given by @xcite@xmath32and the minkowski excited state is given by@xmath33where @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the subscript of the kets represents the modes in the two rindler regions",

    "now , we consider that prior to the execution of moves by the players , the state of the game evolves through a noisy environment .",
    "the interaction of a quantum system with a noisy environment can be described in terms of kraus operators .",
    "the final density matrix of a system when it evolves in a noisy environment can be written as@xmath45where @xmath46 is the initial density matrix of a system and @xmath47 are the kraus operators that describe the interaction of the system with the environment and satisfy the completeness relation @xmath48 .",
    "there could be different kinds of interactions between the system and environment and each kind of interaction has its own form of kraus operators .",
    "the kind of interaction that we consider here is known as amplitude damping .",

    "the kraus operators @xmath52  for the case when only bob s qubit is locally under the influence of environment can be expressed in terms of the single qubit kraus operators as @xmath53 , where @xmath29 is a single qubit identity matrix and @xmath54 .",
    "similarly , when alice s qubit is locally influenced by the environment , the kraus operators for that case become @xmath55 .",
    "the density matrix of the system , after the coupling with environment , becomes@xmath56where @xmath57 in the subscript of @xmath46 is a reminiscence that the game state is influenced by the environment .",

    "more generally , the quantum mechanical strategic spaces of the players can be expressed in terms of unitary operators made up of three parameters @xcite .",

    "( [ e9 ] ) .",
    "if the move cooperation of the players is associated with state @xmath63 and the move defection is associated with state @xmath64 , then the quantum strategy @xmath65 corresponds to @xmath66 and the quantum strategy @xmath2 corresponds to @xmath67 . after executing their moves",
    ", the final density matrix of the game prior to the measurement becomes @xcite@xmath68where the disentangling gate @xmath69  is applied to disentangle the final density matrix in order to make measurement of the payoffs .",
    "the expected payoffs of the players are then found by using the following equation@xmath70where @xmath71 ( @xmath72 $ ] ) are the diagonal elements of the final density matrix and @xmath73 ( @xmath74 $ ] ) are the classical payoffs of the players from table @xmath8 whereas @xmath75 in the superscript of @xmath76 could be any of the classical or quantum strategies .",

    "in each cell of the table , the top payoff corresponds to alice and the bottom one corresponds to bob .",
    "it can easily be seen from the table that the results of ref .",
    "@xcite are retrieved for @xmath79 and for @xmath80 , the classical results are obtained . generally , the symmetry of payoff matrix that exists in the classical form of the game is lost and non of the strategy profiles results in same payoffs to both players . however ,",
    "regarding decoherence , there are two other important features of the payoff matrix of the table that need to be pointed out , ( a ) the payoffs depend only on the decoherence parameter @xmath59 , which means that for unentangled initial state the coupling of the stationary player with the environment have no effect on the payoffs of the players .",
    "this is an important result , as for practical applications of the game , one does nt need to bother about the local coupling of the inertial player with the environment .",
    "( b ) each payoff changes by an amount @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is an integer , such that for a fully decohered ( @xmath83 ) case the acceleration parameter @xmath84 becomes irrelevant and the symmetric classical payoff matrix is retrieved . for a fully decohered case , the decoherence compensates for the asymmetry of the payoff matrix caused by the acceleration of the frame and brings fairness back to the game .",
    "although , for any sets of values of @xmath59 and @xmath34 , alice dominates by playing @xmath2 , however , the dilemma of the classical game exists as the strategy profiles ( @xmath0 ) and ( @xmath85 ) are respectively pareto optimal and nash equilibrium .",

    "in fact , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ e16 ] ) , the choice from the two classical moves is meaningless against @xmath90 both for noisy and noiseless setup of the game .",
