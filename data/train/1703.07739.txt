    "<S> we propose a simple method to engineer the potential energy profile necessary for the observation of conformal crystals of particle systems , in general , and suggest possible experiments in which conformal or quasi - conformal vortex crystals could be observed in bulk superconductors and in thin films .    </S>",
    "<S> six decades after its discovery , the uniform abrikosov lattice  @xcite remains as the only known ordered state of quantized vortices in type - ii superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> hexagonal  @xcite , and in more rare instances even deformed hexagonal and square vortex lattices  @xcite are typically found in clean superconductors cooled under an applied magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , when a type - ii material is cooled at zero field and only then an external field is applied , the final vortex distribution ( called critical state ) is typically nonuniform and highly disordered as a result of the balance between the incoming flux gradient and the random pinning forces produced by material inhomogeneities  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the critical state in superconducting films with periodic and graded arrays of pinning centers has been investigated in detail  @xcite . despite the ordered nature of these pinning arrangements , </S>",
    "<S> the nonuniform vortex configurations reported so far are either disordered or arranged in a domain structure  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the problem of how two - dimensional many - body systems self - organize in order to cope with an imposed density inhomogeneity or surface curvature has inspired growing interest  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a common feature in these systems is the presence of topological defects , appearing either isolated or in groups , that provide the necessary bending of lattice lines while frustrating the global orientational order  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , for a very limited class of planar 2d systems , namely magnetized spheres compressed by gravity  @xcite and confined foams  @xcite , the particles were observed to self - organize into a highly ordered , quasi - conformal crystal with a nonuniform density profile . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , these structures , dubbed gravity rainbow , can be approximately mapped into a uniform hexagonal lattice via a conformal transformation .    </S>",
    "<S> mathematically , a conformal lattice in the complex @xmath0 plane ( representing the physical @xmath1-@xmath2 plane ) is the result of mapping a regular , say hexagonal , lattice defined in an auxiliary @xmath3 plane via a conformal ( angle - preserving ) transformation @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> since the bond angles are all preserved , the lattice in @xmath0 keeps the local hexagonal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the transformation results in a unique , generally nonuniform density distribution given by the expression @xmath5 , with @xmath6 representing the uniform distribution in @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> a relevant question is what external force field can possibly accommodate such density distribution . </S>",
    "<S> an approximate answer has been found only for a limited range of interaction potentials , namely inverse power laws with exponents @xmath7  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the conditions for the observation of conformal crystals in many - body systems that do not fall on this category , such as plasmas , colloids and superconducting vortices , are still unclear .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate that a vortex system subjected to a suitably designed external potential can crystalize in a topologically ordered conformal lattice . </S>",
    "<S> our first step towards a conformal vortex crystal ( cvc ) is to find what ideal external potential can accommodate particles , in general , or vortices , in particular , in a strictly conformal density profile . </S>",
    "<S> we approach this problem within the continuum approximation , which assumes that inter - particle spacings are smaller than any other length scale in the system . in this limit </S>",
    "<S> , the free - energy of a system of @xmath8 particles interacting via a pair potential @xmath9 and subjected to an external potential @xmath10 can be expressed as a functional of the particle distribution  @xcite : @xmath11 = \\int d\\bm{r } \\,n(\\bm{r})\\,u(\\bm{r } ) +      \\frac{1}{2}\\int d\\bm{r}\\,d\\bm{r } ' \\,n(\\bm{r})v_\\text{int}(\\bm{r},\\bm{r}')n(\\bm{r } ' ) . </S>",
    "<S> $ ] by minimizing @xmath12 with respect to @xmath13 , one finds the non - local balance relation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a constant to be determined from the number conservation condition @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that equation   can be approximated by @xmath17 , with @xmath18 , for the cases where @xmath13 changes on a scale much larger than the characteristic length of the interaction potential . </S>",
    "<S> if , in addition , the interparticle force law is central , @xmath19 becomes a constant and @xmath13 is essentially the negative copy of the potential . </S>",
    "<S> this very simple result , which we shall refer to as local approximation , applies only when the interaction potential is short - ranged , as is the case of the vortex - vortex potential in a bulk superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , the full non - local character of eq .   must be dealt with .    to be specific </S>",
    "<S> , we shall henceforth focus on one - dimensional external potentials , @xmath20 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the logarithmic map , @xmath21 , is the only possible transformation that can lead to mechanically stable conformal configurations of particles interacting isotropically  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the required conformal density distribution in the physical @xmath0 plane is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is given by number conservation condition .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now apply these ideas to a system of vortices in a bulk superconductor of thickness @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the london penetration depth . in this case , vortices interact with each other via a central pair potencial given by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the zeroth - order modified bessel function of the second kind and @xmath28 ( with @xmath29 the flux quantum and @xmath30 the vacuum permeability ) . for large distances </S>",
    "<S> , this interaction decays exponentially with a characteristic length @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , by further assuming that @xmath31 , the local approximation can be used , and the necessary external potential can be written as @xmath32 where the first term represents a soft - wall that confines the distribution in the @xmath33 region , @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the wall width @xmath35 was chosen in a way that the maximum force exerted by the external potential , @xmath36 , is less than the vortex - antivortex unbinding force , thus avoiding violation of vortex conservation . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , to deal with a finite number of vortices , we assume that the potential is periodic on a length @xmath37 , that is @xmath38 , and periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath1 direction , also over a length @xmath37 . in all calculations using eq .  [ eq.u(y ) ] we fixed @xmath39 , so that the prescribed conformal transformation maps a rectangle of base @xmath37 into a semiannular region . in this case , since @xmath40 , @xmath41\\simeq2n/\\ell$ ] .     </S>",
    "<S> plane into the @xmath3 plane ( see text ) . </S>",
    "<S> the face color coding of the polygons depict the local topological charge @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the coordination number of the vortex and @xmath44 the corresponding value expected for a topologically flat vortex configuration , i.e. , @xmath45 ( 4 ) , for a vortex in the system bulk ( edge ) . </S>",
    "<S> the gray shades are guides to the eye for better identification of the arch - pillar structure of the conformal crystal . ]    to find low energy configurations of the vortex system , we performed a series of langevin dynamics simulations , following a standard simulated annealing scheme  @xcite , of @xmath46 vortices in a @xmath47 simulation box with periodic boundary conditions and @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cvc_zw]-(a ) depicts a representative example of the most common low - energy configuration . </S>",
    "<S> only a @xmath49 region containing half the number of vortices is shown . as indicated by the gray shading , the lattice lines form an arch - pillar structure characteristic of a conformal lattice obtained via a logarithmic transformation of the regular hexagonal lattice . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , by applying the inverse transformation , @xmath50 , one obtains an almost hexagonal vortex lattice in a semiannular region of the complex @xmath3 plane , as depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cvc_zw]-(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the vertical pillars and arches in the @xmath0 plane appear in the @xmath3 plane as , respectively , radial lines forming angles of @xmath51 and the sides of a regular hexagon . </S>",
    "<S> however , topological charges , here defined as the discrepancy in the number of first neighbors of a vortex with respect to the perfect sixfold coordination , are present . </S>",
    "<S> since isolated charges costs too much energy , they typically appear in pairs ( dislocations ) or even larger groups . </S>",
    "<S> as we shall discuss later these charges play an important role in stabilizing the conformal crystal .    </S>",
    "<S> all other observed configurations presented a similar structure , with arches and pillars . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , this curved structure is so robust that it could also be observed in simulations performed with other ( non - conformal ) shapes of the external potential , although in these cases they are restricted to a smaller region of the system ( see the supplemental material  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , many conformal configurations were found to be broken in domains separated by prominent , transverse grain boundaries ( tgbs ) , such as those shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : profile+defects]-(b ) .        </S>",
    "<S> these dislocation lines are topologically neutral and therefore cost little energy , making it difficult to discern which configuration is closest to the ground state of the system . </S>",
    "<S> however , by counting the number of tgbs of 50 different realizations of the annealing procedure we can conclude that the single - domain , conformal vortex structure is the most frequent configuration and that the frequency of configurations with more than two tgbs drops fast and represents less than one third of the occurrences [ see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : profile+defects]-(c ) ] .    </S>",
    "<S> an important feature , common to all configurations irrespective of the number of tgbs , is that vortices close to the minimum of the external potential tend to form a conventional abrikosov lattice with a principal axis alined with the @xmath1 axis . </S>",
    "<S> going up in the @xmath2 axis by a few vortex rows a transition to the conformal configuration can be identified . in the @xmath3 plane , this depletion zone is seen as concentric vortex rings near the outer rim . while smooth at some regions , the transition is abrupt just below a pillar , where a sudden @xmath52-rotation of the principal axis can be observed . </S>",
    "<S> this sharp transition is delimited by high - angle grain boundaries , known as scars , which are typical defect structures found in large 2d particle systems on curved surfaces and are responsible for distributing the necessary curvature in those systems  @xcite . here , </S>",
    "<S> the net topological charge of each scar is precisely @xmath53 and is counterbalanced by a defect of charge @xmath54 near the top of each pillar . </S>",
    "<S> such configuration is responsible for the deformation necessary to accommodate the conformal crystal while keeping the system globally neutral as imposed by the periodic boundary condition along the @xmath1 axis . </S>",
    "<S> a few extra dislocations found at the top of the configuration in @xmath0 ( or inner rim in @xmath3 ) are associated to another effect , seen in the @xmath3 plane as a gentle but progressive dilation of the hexagonal cells as one approaches the inner rim . </S>",
    "<S> this unexpected behavior reflects the failure of the density profile to follow precisely the exponential shape [ see [ fig : profile+defects]-(a ) ] , specially in the region @xmath55 , where vortex spacings become larger than @xmath25 and the continuum approximation breaks down .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the above described situation , vortices in thin films interact via a long range potential , which , for @xmath56 , is essentially logarithmic , @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , in order to fulfill the periodic boundary conditions , one must take into account the contribution of an infinite set of replicas for each vortex  @xcite , which results in an effectively non - central interaction . </S>",
    "<S> these properties invalidate the local approximation used in the bulk case . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the calculated configuration of logarithmically interacting vortices in a potential described by eq .  [ eq.u(y ) ] is non - conformal and characterized by a flat profile ( see the supplemental material  @xcite ) . however , by numerically integrating the non - local relation , eq .  , using the logarithmic interaction with the appropriate boundary conditions and performing the simulated annealing scheme , conformal vortex crystals with the desired exponential density profile could be observed , see top panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : profile+defects]-(a ) ( a typical conformal configuration is shown in the supplemental material  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> although , the external potential for accommodating cvcs in thin films is very different from that designed for vortices in bulk samples [ see bottom panel of fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : profile+defects]-(a ) ] , their main features are similar . </S>",
    "<S> however , some differences are noteworthy . for instance , the distribution of transverse grain boundaries is slightly different [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : profile+defects]-(c ) ] and suggests that a perfect conformal crystal is more difficult to achieve in thin films . on the other hand , due to the long range nature of the interactions , the density profile seems to fit better to the exponential shape predicted by the continuum theory . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the mapped configurations depict a more homogeneous distribution near the inner rim in contrast to the bulk sample case .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now briefly discuss the possibility of the experimental realization of a cvc . </S>",
    "<S> thin films offer a more direct approach . since these materials are unable to screen magnetic fields , one can print flux - density landscapes directly using an external magnetic texture , produced either by permanent magnets or by current - carrying wires conveniently placed on top of the superconducting film . </S>",
    "<S> these tools have been explored exhaustively on the mesoscopic scale as a means of manipulating vortices individually  @xcite . in order to observe a conformal or quasi - conformal vortex crystal , one would need to design magnetic textures that resemble a smooth exponential flux decay in a length scale covering many vortex lattice spacings .     </S>",
    "<S> is applied in a way that the induced lorentz force pushes the vortices in the clean regions against the vortex barriers . </S>",
    "<S> top : concentration of topological defects in the vortex system as a function of time ( in units of @xmath58 ) after a current density , applied parallel to the pinning walls , is turned on at @xmath59 for three different temperatures ( in units of @xmath60 ) . </S>",
    "<S> bottom : final configuration for @xmath61 exhibiting the quasi - conformal  gravity rainbow \" configuration . ]    for the case of bulk superconducting samples , a possible way to induce a quasi - conformal vortex crystal is by compressing the system against a barrier using the transverse lorentz force induced by a uniform current density applied parallel to the barrier . </S>",
    "<S> this concept is similar to the gravity rainbow experiment of ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> in a superconductor , vortices trapped in strong pinning planes could act as barriers for the vortices in the weak pinning regions , as suggested in the cartoon of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.confexp ] . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , vortex rows strongly at pinned twining planes , which are natural planar defects found in some high-@xmath62 crystals , are known to act as barriers for other vortices  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , one could fabricate strong pinning planes artificially by means of lithographic and irradiation techniques  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to test this idea , we performed langevin dynamics simulations of vortices in a clean superconductor with a periodic array of identical pining potential planes modeled as @xmath63 , with @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> two planes were placed at @xmath65 and @xmath66 and periodic boundary conditions were considered in a @xmath67 simulation box containing 6.000 vortices . after a simulated annealing procedure </S>",
    "<S> an essentially homogeneous triangular vortex lattice was obtained , but with slightly higher vortex density at the line positions . </S>",
    "<S> then , we suddenly applied a current density @xmath68 much smaller then the depinning current ( @xmath69 ) , thus guaranteeing a static final configuration of the vortices . the vortices were observed to quickly compress into a linear profile , while generating a large amount of defects , and thereupon healed progressively until finally stabilizing into a quasi - conformal configuration , as the one shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.confexp ] ( see also the supplementary video  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this self - organization process was observed to accelerate with the addition of small thermal fluctuations , which provide the defects with enhanced mobility allowing them to redistribute and eventually annihilate . </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution of the defect concentration for three different temperatures as well as the final configuration for @xmath70 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.confexp ] , top panel . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to mention that in a real sample the healing of defects could be compromised by the ubiquitous material disorder , which tends to force the vortex system into a glassy state . </S>",
    "<S> however , in weak pinning superconductors , these states are characterized by a dilute distribution of topological defects that can be healed by e.g. thermal fluctuations , gentle ac shaking or a combination of both  @xcite .    in conclusion , we have provided theoretical evidences that superconducting vortices , either in bulk materials or in thin films , can self - organize into highly ordered conformal crystals when subjected to a suitable external potential . </S>",
    "<S> we proposed a simple model for anticipating the external potential necessary for accommodating conformal crystals for any given interaction potential , including long - range interacting systems . </S>",
    "<S> as such , we expect that the results presented here also apply to other confined systems of interacting objects , e.g. colloids , plasmas and vortices in bose - einstein condensates . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , this study can be easily extended to other kinds of macroscopic confinement , such as potentials with circular symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the case of unidirectional confinement considered in the present work , a whole set of different conformal crystals could be stabilized by suitable choices of radial confinement . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> an accurate computation of the appropriate external potential is essential to discern the possible conformal structures . </S>"
