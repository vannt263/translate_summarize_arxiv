    "we use the location of the background charge to tune from stronger confinement ( smaller @xmath9 ) to weaker confinement ( larger @xmath9 ) .",

    "@xcite the definitions of the electron operators and matrix elements are consistent with the corresponding ll index ; the common practice is to map them into the 0ll representation using ladder operators across lls .",
    "@xcite at various @xmath15 , we study the spectrum of the model hamiltonian numerically by exact diagonalization using the lanczos algorithm up to 7 electrons for @xmath16 , 10 electrons for @xmath17 , 14 electrons for @xmath0 , and 20 electrons for @xmath18 .",
    "our approach features the inclusion of a realistic confining potential due to the neutralizing background charge ; it allows us to study the energetics in the microscopic model quantitatively and compare with the experimental observations .",
    "for example , we can identify various phases by studying the total angular momentum of the ground state @xmath19 of the model as @xmath9 varies at a given @xmath15 , as illustrated in fig .",

    "the size of the candles reflects the range of velocities in the corresonding groundstatable range of the confining potential strength ( or @xmath9 ) .",
    "the candle data for @xmath75 are based on 20 electrons in 30 orbitals for various confining potential strength , while the errorbars reflect our estimate of the uncertainty due to finite - size effects .",

    "as explained in earlier studies ,  @xcite we first mix 3-body interaction with coulomb interaction to allow a clear separation of bulk modes and edge modes . in this case , the lowest edge excitation with @xmath78 has an excitation energy @xmath79 being the sum of the two neutral excitation energies at @xmath80 and @xmath81 due to the anti - periodic boundary condition in the absence of bulk quasiparticles .",

    "we can fit the trend by a linear dependence on @xmath9 . at @xmath0 ,",
    "we find that the velocities in the thermodynamic limit are @xmath88 in unit of @xmath89 .",

    ", finite temperature @xmath90 introduces an additional energy scale to compete with the traverse frequency for quasiparticles ( or edge waves ) propagating from one point contact to another between multiple reflections within the interferometer .",
    "therefore , the aharonov - bohm type oscillation will be washed out above the coherence temperature  @xcite @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the distance along the interference path between the two point contacts . for the moore - read pfaffian ( or anti - pfaffian ) state , @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( or @xmath95 ) are the corresponding scaling dimensions . using our results for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we plot @xmath96 in the moore - read phase for charge @xmath6 quasiparticles and the @xmath7 quasiparticles in the ising vacuum sector ( @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) as a function of @xmath9 in fig .  [ fig3 ] , assuming a point contact distance of @xmath99 @xmath100 m . here , we use the extrapolated value of @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the thermodynamic limit for the coulomb interaction [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : trend1 ] ) and ( [ eq : trend2 ] ) ] . therefore ,",
    "in an interference experiment , we expect that with increasing @xmath90 the conductance oscillations due to the interference of @xmath6 quasiparticles ( thus signatures of non - abelian statistics ) will disappear first at a lower temperature , which depends strongly on the details of the confinement potential . on the other hand , the oscillations due to @xmath7 quasiparticles will persist up to about 150 mk , which is less sensitive to the confinement .",
    "this picture and the corresponding temperature ranges agree with the willett experiment  @xcite quantitatively .    for the solid range of the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( or @xmath101 ) , we can justify the groundstatability of the moore - read state in a 12-electron system in 26 orbitals with the pure coulomb interaction .",
    "this range is sensitive to the system size and the number of orbitals ; e.g. , we found it to be @xmath102 for the 12-electron system in 22 orbitals .",
    "this indicates that the stability of the moore - read state is sensitive to the sharpness of the edge confinement . in general , we find the groundstatable range becomes wider in larger systems ; therefore , it is tempting to extrapolate the trend in velocities [ eqs .",

    ", multiple competing phases also exist in the bulk .",
    "@xcite therefore , a significant change of the edge - mode velocities must follow from significant changes of parameters , which normally lead to various instabilities .",
    "for example , when background confining potential becomes weaker , edge reconstruction  @xcite takes place , changing the ground state and creating additional neutral modes with smaller velocities .",
    "consequently , @xmath1 increases in the reconstructed case ( see fig .",

    "it is , however , possible that @xmath2 can become smaller in the weaker confining potential that leads to edge reconstruction .",
    "@xcite    in reality , the finite spread of the electron wavefunction in the perpendicular direction tends to soften the coulomb interaction .",
    "while we focus strictly on zero layer thickness in the presentation , the velocity ranges can not change too much because the finite thickness also changes the confining potential arising from charge neutrality , so the groundstatability windows shift accordingly .",
