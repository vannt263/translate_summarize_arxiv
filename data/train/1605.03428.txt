    "a hyperspectral image ( aka . hyperspectral cube ) consists of two spatial dimensions and a spectral dimension .",
    "the latter contains information pertinent to the intrinsic material properties of the object .",
    "this spectral information in hsi makes them well suited for classification tasks , such as scene recognition  @xcite , 3d reconstruction  @xcite , saliency detection  @xcite , pedestrian detection  @xcite , material classification  @xcite , cultural heritage  @xcite and many more . in this paper",
    ", we propose a framework for hyperspectral image classification , where each band in the hsi is considered as a separate image .",
    "treating the problem at the image - level allows us to exploit high - level information , like shapes , that help to improve the classification performance .",
    "we use traditional feature descriptors ( i.e. sift  @xcite , hog  @xcite , lbp  @xcite ) for image - level feature extraction and classification ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : frontpage ] for illustration ) . for the demonstration of our method",
    ", we investigate into face recognition using wavelengths ranging from the visible ( @xmath0 ) to the near - infrared ( @xmath1 ) spectrum .",
    "the availability of more bands than the usual three rgb bands has been shown advantageous in disambiguating objects . in literature , the common tendency to exploit the hyperspectral data has been addressed at pixel - level . as the spatial and spectral dimensions in hsi increase ,",
    "it is difficult to separate hyperspectral data at the pixel - level for large classes dataset using statistical methods  @xcite . however , in our method classification is done at the image - level , where from each image we extracted a limited number of features , far fewer than the number of pixels . with such smaller numbers of features at hand",
    ", we can afford to not further reduce the number of spectral bands that are considered .",
    "this allows us to exploit the entire input space without losing information for feature extraction .",
    "we show that the entire feature space information leads to significantly improved performance in a face recognition task .",
    "recently , deep learning ( dl ) a learning - based representation has outperformed traditional descriptors for deriving distinctive features in image classification task  @xcite , but dl has a major shortcoming : it requires many samples for the training process and an insufficient number of training samples quickly leads the network to overfitting . as we already know",
    ", in hsi the spectral bands are very unique and discriminative .",
    "thus , we believe traditional feature descriptors can effectively exploit this spectral information and help to generate powerful feature representation of their content that characterize the object better . in this work ,",
    "we have explored the hand - crafted hsi features in v - nir images and also have shown improvement in the classification performance by a significant margin for a face recognition task .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : relatedwork ] , we discuss the related work , and section  [ sec : method ] describes our proposed method .",
    "experiments and analysis are given in section  [ sec : experiments ] , and finally , the conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "there is an extensive work on hsi classification , but here we mention a few relevant papers on face recognition task only . during the last decade ,",
    "face recognition has achieved great success .",
    "the research has tended to focus on rgb or b / w images , rather less attention has been paid to hyperspectral images . in this paper , we focus on hsi face recognition .",
    "the idea of face recognition in hyperspectral images , started with pan et al .",
    "@xcite , who manually extracted the mean spectral signatures from the human face in the nir spectrum , and were then compared using mahalabonis distance .",
    "further in  @xcite pan et al . extended their work  @xcite by incorporating spatial information in addition to spectral .",
    "similarly , robila et al .",
    "@xcite also uses spectral signatures but their comparison criterion was spectral angle measurements .",
    "almost all the existing proposed hsi face recognition methods perform dimensionality reduction and the low - dimensional feature space are extracted for classification . di et al .",
    "@xcite projected the hyperspectral image into low dimensional space using 2d - pca for feature extraction , and were then compared using euclidean distance . in recent works ,",
    "shen and zheng  @xcite apply 3d gabor wavelets with different central frequencies to extract signal variances in the hyperspectral data .",
    "liang et al .",
    "@xcite utilize 3d high - order texture pattern descriptor to extract distinctive micro - patterns which integrate the spatial - spectral information as features .",
    "uzair et al .",
    "@xcite apply 3d discrete cosine transformation and extract the low frequency coefficients as features , where partial least squares regression is used for classification .",
    "uzair et al .",
    "most recent work in  @xcite extended their previous study  @xcite and employed 3d cubelets to extract the spatio - spectral covariance features for face recognition .",
    "in contrast , in our work , the hyperspectral image is fully exploited without losing information by performing feature extraction and classification at the image - level .",
    "[ fig : tsne ]    0.45        0.45",
    "in the last two decades , researchers have developed robust descriptors ( feature extraction methods ) to extract useful feature representations from the image that are highly distinctive and are perfect for an efficient and robust object recognition .",
    "the traditional feature descriptors ( sift , hog , lbp and more ) have several advantages .",
    "these features are invariant to image scaling , geometric and photometric transformations : translations or rotations , common object variations , minimally affected by noise and small distortions , and to a great extent invariant to change in illumination .",
    "these descriptors when combined with hyperspectral images , make the extracted features even more robust and powerful .",
    "we believe that the extracted new class of features obtained from hyperspectral images shall give near - perfect separation because these features are generated from highly discriminative bands ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ex_dataset ] ) in hsi that are captured in different wavelengths .",
    "these images captured in different wavelength range , contain discriminative information that characterize the object better with great precision and detail .",
    "[ fig : scnn ] shows the schematic layout of our framework for hyperspectral image classification . in our work , each mono - spectral band in the hsi is treated as a separate image .",
    "treating the mono - spectral bands as separate images , allows us to exploit : the discriminative texture patterns present in the images captured in different wavelengths , hence able to utilize the entire space without losing information for feature extraction .",
    "then , the features are extracted for each mono - spectral band using a feature extraction method ( e.g. hog , lbp , and sift ) .",
    "this allows us to capture the high - level information like shapes and abstract concepts from images : making it more suitable for high - level visual recognition tasks , similar is not possible at pixel - level .",
    "classification at the pixel - level ( think of raw pixel values ) comes at high computational burden , and it turns out that , it is difficult to disambiguate objects with large classes dataset by simple concatenating of multi - spectral data into single pixel - related vectors using statistical methods . thus , we extract from each image a limited number of features , far fewer than the number of pixels . with such smaller numbers of features at hand ,",
    "we show that , we achieve better recognition results , significantly outperforming pixel - level features ( see table  [ table : soa ] ) , and can afford to not further reduce the number of spectral bands that are considered .",
    "then , the extracted feature vectors are fed to linear one vs all svm classifier , where we have a svm for each band .",
    "for the final label prediction , we merge the predictions of all svm learners trained on different bands using majority voting .    for feature extraction of each mono - spectral image ,",
    "we use a fixed - size representation to extract sift , lbp and hog features . the parameters for feature extraction ( i.e. window size , step size , number of oriented bins , number of clusters , and more ) contribute to the good results , and play a crucial role in improving the recognition performance .",
    "in section  [ sec : experiments ] , we describe the implementation setup in detail .    the performance of the the proposed approach is demonstrated for face recognition in hsi .",
    "excellent results show that these robust feature descriptors are perfect for reliable face recognition in hyperspectral images .",
    "the proposed method in the previous section was tested on two standard hyperspectral face datasets  @xcite for a face recognition task .",
    "our experiments consist of two parts . in the first part",
    ", we compare our proposed method with the state - of - the - art hsi face recognition methods .",
    "then in the second part , we compare the usefulness of the discriminative spectral bands with the rgb image representation of hsi .",
