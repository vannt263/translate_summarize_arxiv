    "efficient techniques for performing optical beam displacement measurements are crucial for many applications .",
    "when an optical beam is reflected from , or transmitted through , an object that is moving , the mechanical movement can be translated to a movement of the optical beam .",
    "characterisation of the transverse position of this beam then yields an extremely accurate measurement of the object movement .",
    "some example applications that use these techniques are : _ atomic force microscopy _ , where a beam displacement measurement is used to characterise the vibration of a cantilever , and the force the cantilever experiences @xcite ; _ inter - satellite position stabilisation _ , where a displacement measurement allows a receiving satellite to orient itself to an optical beam sent by another satellite , thus allowing a reduction of non - common mode positional vibrations between satellites @xcite ; and _ optical tweezer _",
    ", where the position of particles held in an optical tweezer can be detected and controlled by measuring the position of the beam @xcite .",
    "an understanding of the fundamental limits imposed on these opto - mechanical positional measurements is therefore important .",
    "recently there has been increasing interests , both theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite , in using quantum resources to enhance optical displacement measurements .",
    "much of the interest has been on how multi - mode squeezed light can be used to enhance the outcome of split detector and array detector measurements .",
    "this is an important question since split detectors and arrays are the primary instruments presently used in displacement measurements and imaging systems .    in spite of the successes in using multi - mode squeezed light to achieve displacement measurements beyond the quantum noise limit ( qnl )",
    ", we will show in this paper that split detection is not an optimum displacement measurement . assuming that the beam under interrogation is a tem@xmath0 beam , we perform a multimodal analysis to derive the qnl for optical displacement measurements .",
    "we then analyse split detection , the conventional technique used to characterise beam displacement , and compare it to the qnl .",
    "we find that displacement measurement using split detection is not quantum noise limited , and is at best only @xmath1  % efficient . as an alternative",
    ", we consider a new homodyne detection scheme , utilising a tem@xmath2 mode local oscillator beam .",
    "we show that this scheme performs at the qnl in the limit of small displacement .",
    "this technique , which we term tem@xmath2 homodyne detection , has the potential to enhance many applications presently using split detectors to measure displacement .",
    "furthermore , the qnl for optical displacement measurement can be surpassed by introducing a squeezed tem@xmath2 mode into the measurement process .",
    "the position of a light beam can be defined as the mean position of all photons in the beam .",
    "beam displacement is then quantified by the amount of deviation of this mean photon position from some fixed reference axis . in this paper",
    ", we assume that the displaced beam has a transverse tem@xmath0 mode - shape . to simplify our analysis",
    ", we assume , without loss of generality , a one - dimensional transverse displacement @xmath3 from the reference axis .",
    "the normalised transverse beam amplitude function for a displaced tem@xmath0 beam , assuming a waist size of @xmath4 , is given by @xmath5\\ ] ] the transverse intensity distribution for a beam with a total of @xmath6 photons is then given by @xmath7 .",
    "this equation essentially describes the normalised gaussian spatial distribution of photons along one transverse axis of the optical beam .    for a coherent tem@xmath0 light beam ,",
    "the photons have gaussian distribution in transverse position , and poissonian distribution in time .",
    "it is clear that a detector which discriminates the transverse position of each photon will provide the maximum possible information about the displacement of the beam .",
    "such discrimination could , for example , be achieved using an infinite single photon resolving array with infinitesimally small pixels .",
    "although in reality such a detection device is unfeasible , it nevertheless sets a bound to the information obtainable for beam displacement without resorting to quantum resources .",
    "this bound therefore constitutes a quantum noise limited displacement measurement .",
    "more practical detection schemes can therefore be benchmarked against this limit .",
    "let us now examine an optimum measurement of beam displacement using our idealised array detector .",
    "using equation ( [ disp00 ] ) , the probability distribution of photons along the @xmath8-axis of the detector is given by @xmath9\\ ] ] as each photon in the beam impinges on the array , a single pixel is triggered , locating that photon .",
    "the mean arrival position of each photon @xmath10 and the standard deviation @xmath11 are given by @xmath12 from the arrival of a single photon we can therefore estimate the displacement of our mode with a standard deviation given by @xmath13 . for @xmath6 photons , the standard deviation becomes @xmath14 .",
    "the minimum displacement discernible by a given detection apparatus is directly related to the sensitivity of the apparatus , defined here as the derivative of the mean signal divided by its standard deviation . for infinite array detection , the signal expectation value is equal to the displacement .",
    "thus the qnl for optimal displacement measurement sensitivity is given by @xmath15 a plot of @xmath16 as a function of displacement is shown in fig .",
    "[ snr ] . since all pixels in the array",
    "are assumed to be identical , the standard deviation @xmath17 is independent of displacement .",
    "we therefore observe that @xmath18 is constant for all displacements .",
    "@xmath18 is also proportional to @xmath19 due to the quantum noise limited nature of the beam .",
    "finally , the inverse scaling with waist size @xmath4 suggests that the accuracy of a displacement measurement can be enhanced by focussing the beam to a smaller waist .      in the previous section",
    ", we saw how an idealised array detector can be used to perform quantum noise limited displacement measurements .",
    "implementation of such a detector , however , is clearly impractical .",
    "the most common technique for displacement measurement is _ split detection _ @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "the beam under interrogation is incident centrally on a split detector .",
    "the difference between the two photo - currents of the two halves then contains information about the displacement of the beam ( see figure [ sd ] ) .",
    ".,width=226 ]    at this stage we must introduce a more methodical representation of the beam .",
    "a beam of frequency @xmath20 can be represented by the positive frequency part of the electric field operator @xmath21 .",
    "we are interested in the transverse information of the beam which is fully described by the slowly varying field envelope operator @xmath22 .",
    "we express this operator in terms of the displaced tem@xmath23 basis modes , where @xmath24 denotes the order of the @xmath8-axis hermite - gauss mode .",
    "since this paper considers one - dimensional beam displacement , we henceforth denote the beam amplitude function for the transverse modes with only one index .",
    "@xmath22 can then be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the transverse beam amplitude functions for the displaced tem@xmath23 modes and @xmath27 are the corresponding annihilation operators .",
    "@xmath27 is normally expressed as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the coherent amplitude and @xmath30 is a quantum noise operator .",
    "since the beam is assumed to be a tem@xmath0 mode , only this mode has coherent excitation and therefore only @xmath31 is nonzero .",
    "the field operator is then given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "the difference photo - current , which provides information on the displacement of the beam relative to the centre of the detector , is given by @xmath34\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the photon number operators for the left and right halves of the detector , respectively .",
    "this expression can be simplified by changing bases from the tem@xmath23 basis , to a tem@xmath23 basis that has a @xmath37-phase flip at the center of the detector @xcite .",
    "this new basis is defined by @xmath38 and we denote annihilation operators for this basis as @xmath39 .",
    "if the incident tem@xmath0 field is bright , so that @xmath40 for all @xmath24 , the difference photo - current @xmath41 can be written compactly as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the amplitude quadrature operator associated with our new flipped basis , given by @xmath44 ; and @xmath45 is the overlap coefficient between the first flipped mode and the tem@xmath0 mode",

    "we see that for small displacements where @xmath51 , the normalised difference photo - current is linearly proportional to the displacement and can be approximated by @xmath52 as @xmath3 approaches the waist size of the beam , @xmath4 , the normalised difference photo - current begins to roll off and asymptotes to a constant for larger @xmath3 .",
    "this can be easily understood , since for @xmath53 the beam is incident almost entirely on one side of the detector . in this regime",
    ", large beam displacements only cause small variations in @xmath54 , making is difficult to determine the beam displacement precisely .",
    "the noise of our displacement measurement , @xmath55 , is then related to the noise of the difference photo - current , @xmath56 , via @xmath57 giving a sensitivity of @xmath58 for a coherent state .",
