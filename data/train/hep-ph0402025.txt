    "for almost 70 years , neutrinos have played a pivotal role in the the quest to understand elementary particles and their interactions .",
    "the neutrino was actually the first particle proposed by a theorist to guarantee the validity of a symmetry principle : pauli boldly suggested @xcite that neutrinos ( invisible then and remaining so for another twenty five years ) are emitted together with electrons in nuclear beta decay to salvage both energy and angular momentum conservation in the beta decay process .",
    "experimental confirmation of pauli s hypothesis required many decades of experimental effort , but the discovery of the antineutrino in the fifties by reines and cowan @xcite and subsequent experiments in the early sixties ultimately led to the nobel prizes for reines ( 1995 ) and lederman , schwartz and steinberger ( 1988 ) .",
    "more recently , the 2002 nobel prize was awarded to davis and koshiba for their seminal roles in the development of neutrino astrophysics ( along with giaconni for x - ray astrophysics ) .",
    "the standard model of electroweak interactions , developed in the late 1960 s , provided a theoretical framework to incorporate the neutrinos as left - handed partners to the charged leptons , organized in two generations along with the quarks .",
    "the subsequent discovery of charmed quarks and the third generation of quarks and leptons completed the modern view of the standard model of electroweak interactions .",
    "this version possessed additional richness to incorporate cp violation , and further efforts to unify the strong interaction led to the development of grand unified theories ( guts ) .",
    "these guts provided a natural framework for nucleon decay and for neutrino masses , and motivated many experiments in the field .",
    "following on the successes of big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and the discovery of the cosmic microwave background , it also became clear that neutrinos were potentially major players in the history of the early universe .",
    "the increasing evidence for the existence ( and then dominance ) of dark matter in the universe then led to the economical and seductive hypothesis that neutrinos , with small but finite mass , could provide the mass to explain the dark matter .",
    "this set the stage for a major experimental assault on the issue of neutrino mass and its role in cosmology , and provided substantial impetus to a worldwide program of experiments addressing the issues of finite neutrino mass and the possibility of mixing between generations .",
    "although it now appears that neutrinos are not likely the source of dark matter in the universe , the experimental evidence obtained in the last decade for finite neutrino masses and mixing between generations is strong and irrefutable .",
    "the pattern of masses and mixing angles emerging from the experiments provides an intriguing glimpse into the fundamental source of particle mass and the role of flavor in the scheme of particles and their interactions .",
    "the scale of neutrino mass differences motivates new experimental searches for double beta decay and end - point anomalies in beta decay , as well as new studies of oscillation phenomena using accelerators , nuclear reactors , and astrophysical sources of neutrinos .    in this review ,",
    "we attempt to synthesize these themes , present a concise and coherent view of the experimental and theoretical developments leading to the current picture , and motivate the future explorations necessary to resolve the remaining issues .",
    "we begin with a summary of the theoretical motivation for studying neutrino masses and mixing , along with a development of the phenomenological framework for interpreting the experiments .",
    "this includes neutrino oscillations in vacuum as well as in matter , cp violation , ordinary beta decay , and double beta decay .",
    "we then review the recent experimental data that contribute to our present knowledge of these neutrino properties .",
    "we discuss the successful neutrino oscillation measurements , including the key contributions from various solar neutrino experiments , cosmic ray - induced atmospheric neutrino studies , and the recent dramatic results from the sudbury neutrino observatory and the kamland reactor neutrino experiment .",
    "important additional information is obtained from the experimental attempts that have thus far only yielded limits on neutrino masses such as double beta decay and tritium beta decay .",
    "we also will briefly discuss the role of massive neutrinos in cosmology , and the corresponding constraints .",
    "the discussion of the future experimental program is separated into two different time scales . in the near - term future",
    ", the planned experiments will focus on a better determination of the mixing matrix parameters , in particular @xmath0 , and resolution of the lsnd puzzle ( right or wrong ) .",
    "further studies in the longer - term will of course depend on the outcome of these measurements , but there is substantial interest in pursuing the search for cp violation , the possibility that neutrinos are majorana particles and other issues related to the mechanism(s ) responsible for the observed phenomena .",
    "it is natural to expect that neutrinos have nonvanishing masses , since they are not required to be massless by gauge invariance or other symmetry principles .",
    "moreover , all other known fermions , quarks and charged leptons , are massive .",
    "nevertheless , neutrinos are very light , much lighter than the other fermions , and this striking qualitative feature needs to be understood , even though we do not know why e.g. the electron mass is what it is known to be , and why muons and taus are heavier than electrons .",
    "the most popular explanation of the small neutrino masses is the `` see - saw mechanism '' @xcite in which the neutrino masses are inversely proportional to some large mass scale @xmath1 .",
    "simply put , if neutrinos are majorana particles , i.e. , indistiguishable from their own antiparticles , they have only two states , corresponding to the two possible spin orientations . on the other hand , dirac particles , distinct from their antiparticles , have four states , two spin orientations for the particle and antiparticle . in the `` see - saw mechanism '' there are still four states for each neutrino family , but they are widely split by the `` majorana mass term '' ( explained later ) into the two - component light neutrinos with masses @xmath2 and the very heavy ( sterile ) two - component neutrinos with the mass @xmath1 , in such a way that @xmath3 .",
    "further , if we assume that the `` dirac mass '' @xmath4 is of the same order of magnitude as the dirac fermion masses ( masses of quarks and charged leptons ) , we can understand why @xmath2 is so small , provided @xmath1 is very large .",
    "if that explanation of the small neutrino mass is true , then the experimentally observed neutrinos are majorana particles , and hence the total lepton number is not conserved .",
    "observation of the violation of the total lepton number conservation ( we explain further why it is difficult to observe it ) would be a signal that neutrinos are indeed majorana particles .",
    "neutrinos interact with other particles only by weak interactions ( at least as far as we know ) ; they do not have electromagnetic or color charges . that further distinguishes them from the other fermions which also interact electromagnetically ( charged leptons and quarks ) and strongly ( quarks ) .",
    "it is well known that the weak charged currents of quarks do not couple to a definite flavor state ( or mass state ) , but to linear combinations of quark states .",
    "this phenomenon is described by the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , which by convention describes linear combinations of the charge @xmath5 quark mass eigenstates @xmath6 .",
    "the mixed states @xmath7 , form weak doublets with the @xmath8 quark mass eigenstates . consequently",
    ", the three generations of quark doublets are not independently preserved in charged - current weak processes .",
    "an analogous situation is encountered with neutrinos .",
    "there , however , one can directly observe only the ` weak eigenstates ' , i.e. , neutrinos forming weak charged currents with electrons , muons or tau .. since the ckm matrix is nearly diagonal , the labels @xmath7 can be used for the ` weak eigenstates ' . in neutrinos , on the other hand , only the ` weak eigenstates ' have special names , @xmath9 while the mass eigestates are labelled @xmath10 and can not be associated with any particular lepton flavor . ] information on the neutrino mixing matrix is best obtained by the study of neutrino oscillation , a quantum mechanical interference effect resulting from the mixing . as a consequence , like in quarks ,",
    "the flavor ( or family ) is not conserved and , for example , a beam of electron neutrinos could , after travelling a certain distance , acquire a component of muon or tau flavor neutrinos .",
    "we describe the physics and formalism of the oscillations next .",
    "the formalism has been covered in great detail in numerous books and reviews .",
    "thus , we restrict ourselves only to the most essential points",
    ". the interested reader can find more details in the monographs @xcite and recent reviews @xcite .      in the standard model",
    "individual lepton charges ( @xmath11 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 and @xmath14 for @xmath15 , and @xmath16 and analogously for @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) are conserved .",
    "thus , processes such as @xmath19 , or @xmath20 are forbidden .",
    "indeed , such processes have not been observed so far , and small upper limits for their branching ratios have been established .",
    "based on these empirical facts , the standard model places the left - handed components of the charged lepton and neutrino fields into the doublets of the group @xmath21 , @xmath22 while the right - handed components of the charged lepton fields are singlets .",
    "the right - handed components of the neutrino fields are _ absent _ in the standard electroweak model by definition .    as a consequence of this assignment ,",
    "neutrinos are deemed to be massless , and the individual lepton numbers , as well as the total one , are strictly conserved .",
    "note that with these assignments neutrino masses do not arise even from loop corrections .",
    "thus , observation of neutrino oscillations , leading to the neutrino flavor nonconservation , signals deviations from this simple picture , and to the ` physics beyond the standard model ' .",
    "note also that studies of @xmath23 annihilation at the @xmath24-resonance peak have determined the invisible width of the @xmath24 boson , caused by its decay into unobservable channels . interpreting this width as a measure of the number of neutrino active flavors , one obtains @xmath25 from the four lep experiments @xcite .",
    "we can , therefore , quite confidently conclude that there are just three active neutrinos with masses of less than @xmath26 .",
    "( the relation of this finding to the fact that there are also three flavors of quarks is suggestive , but so far not really understood . ) besides these three active neutrino flavors there could be other neutrinos which do not partipate in weak interactions .",
    "such neutrinos are called ` sterile ' . in general , the active and sterile neutrinos can mix , and thus the sterile neutrino can interact , albeit with a reduced strength .    big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) is sensitive to the number of neutrino flavors which are ultrarelativistic at the ` freezeout ' when the @xmath27 reactions are no longer in equilibrium and therefore it is perhaps sensitive to ( almost ) sterile neutrinos .",
    "however , analysis of bbn ( i.e. , of the abundances of @xmath28he , @xmath29 , @xmath30he , and @xmath31li ) are consistent with 3 neutrinos , and disfavors @xmath32 for fully thermalized neutrinos @xcite .      in a field theory of neutrinos",
    "the mass is determined by the mass term in the langrangian . since the right - handed neutrinos are absent in the standard electroweak model",
    ", one can either generalize the model and define the mass term by using the ideas of the see - saw mechanism , or one can add more possibilities by adding to the three known neutrino fields @xmath33 new fields , corresponding to possibly heavy right - handed neutrinos @xmath34 .",
    "the mass term is then constructed out of the fields @xmath33 , their charge - conjugated and thus right - handed fields @xmath35 and from the fields @xmath36 .",
    "there are , in general , two types of mass terms , @xmath37 ( the term with @xmath38 is left out assuming that the corresponding coefficients are vanishing or negligibly small . )",
    "the first term is a dirac mass term , analogous to the mass term of charged leptons .",
    "it conserves the total lepton number , but might violate the individual lepton flavor numbers .",
    "the second term is a majorana mass term which breaks the total lepton number conservation by two units .",
    "it is allowed only if the neutrinos have no additive conserved charges of any kind .",
    "if there are 3 left handed neutrinos @xmath33 , and @xmath39 additional sterile neutrinos @xmath34 it is convenient to define @xmath40 the matrix @xmath41 is a symmetric complex matrix and @xmath42 is the transposed matrix .",
    "after diagonalization it has @xmath43 mass eigenstates @xmath44 that represent majorana neutrinos @xmath45 .    from the point of view of phenomenology",
    ", there are several cases to be discussed .",
    "the seesaw mechanism corresponds to the case when the scale of @xmath46 is very large .",
    "there are three light active majorana neutrinos in that case",
    ".    on the other hand , if the scale of @xmath46 is not too high when compared to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale , there could be more than three light majorana neutrinos , mixtures of active and sterile . finally , when @xmath47 there are six massive majorana neutrinos that merge to form three massive dirac neutrinos .",
    "the unitary matrix diagonalizing the mass term is a @xmath48 matrix in that case . in these latter cases",
    "the ` natural ' explanation of the lightness of neutrinos is missing .",
    "we shall not speculate further on the pattern of the mass matrix , even though a vast literature exists on that subject ( see e.g. @xcite for a partial list of recent references ) . in the interesting case of @xmath49 light left - handed majorana neutrinos ,",
    "the mass matrix is determined by @xmath49 neutrino masses , @xmath50 mixing angles , @xmath51 cp violating phases common to dirac and majorana neutrinos , and @xmath52 majorana phases that affect only processes which violate the total lepton number ( for the discussion of these majorana phases see e.g. @xcite ) .      as stated earlier ,",
    "the neutrinos participating in the charged current weak interactions ( the usual way neutrinos are observed and the only way their flavor can be discerned ) are characterized by the flavor ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "but the neutrinos of definite flavor are not necessarily states of a definite mass . instead , they are generally coherent superpositions of such states , @xmath54 when the standard model is extended to include neutrino mass , the mixing matrix @xmath55 is unitary .    in vacuum ,",
    "the mass eigenstates propagate as plane waves . leaving out the common phase , a beam of ultrarelativistic neutrinos @xmath56 with energy @xmath57 at the distance @xmath58 acquires a phase @xmath59 given that , the amplitude of the process @xmath60 is @xmath61 and the probability of the flavor change for @xmath62 is the square of this amplitude . it is obvious that due to the unitarity of @xmath55 there is no flavor change if all masses vanish or are exactly degenerate . the existence of the oscillations is a simple consequence of the coherence in eq .",
    "( [ e : super ] ) .",
    "the detailed description of the quantum mechanics of the oscillations in terms of wave packets is subtle and a bit involved ( see , e.g. the reviews @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it includes , among ather things , the concept of coherence length , a distance after which there is no longer coherence in eq .",
    "( [ e : super ] ) . for the purpose of this review such issues are irrelevant , and will not be discussed further .",
    "the idea of oscillations was discussed early on by pontecorvo @xcite and by maki , nakagawa and sakata @xcite .",
    "hence , the mixing matrix @xmath55 is often associated with these names and the notation @xmath63 or @xmath64 is used .",
    "the formula for the probability is particularly simple when only two neutrino flavors , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , mix appreciably , since only one mixing angle is then relevant , @xmath67 ~ , \\label{e : osc2}\\ ] ] where the appropriate factors of @xmath68 and @xmath69 were included ( the same is obtained when the length is in meters and energy in mev ) . here",
    "@xmath70 ( note that the sign is irrelevant ) is the mass squared difference .",
    "thus , the oscillations in this simple case are characterized by the oscillation length @xmath71 and by the amplitude @xmath72 .    for obvious reasons",
    "the oscillation studies are optimally performed at distances @xmath73 from the neutrino source . at shorter distances",
    "the oscillation amplitude is reduced and at larger distances the neutrino flux is reduced making the experiment more difficult . note that at distance @xmath74 the oscillation pattern is smeared out and the oscillation probability ( [ e : osc2 ] ) approaches @xmath75 and becomes independent of @xmath76 .    the mixing matrix of 3 neutrinos is parametrized by three angles , conventionally denoted as @xmath77 , one @xmath78 violating phase @xmath79 and two majorana phases @xmath80 .",
    "using @xmath69 for the cosine and @xmath81 for the sine , we write @xmath55 as    @xmath82    by convention the mixing angle @xmath83 is associated with the solar neutrino oscillations , hence the masses @xmath84 and @xmath85 are separated by the smaller interval @xmath86 ( we shall assume , again by convention , that @xmath87 ) while @xmath88 is separated from the 1,2 pair by the larger interval @xmath89 , and can be either lighter or heavier than @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",

    "not everybody follows these conventions , so caution should be used when comparing the various results appearing in the literature .",
    "the general formula for the probability that the `` transition '' @xmath92 happens at @xmath58 is @xmath93    clearly , the probability ( [ e : oscg ] ) is independent of the majorana phases @xmath94 .",
    "the oscillations described by the eq.([e : oscg ] ) violate the individual flavor lepton numbers , but conserve the total lepton number .",
    "the oscillation pattern is identical for dirac or majorana neutrinos .",
    "the general formula can be simplified in several cases of practical importance . for 3 neutrino flavors , using the empirical fact that @xmath95 and considering distances comparable to the atmospheric neutrino oscillation length , only three parameters are relevant in the zeroth order , the angles @xmath96 and @xmath0 and @xmath97 .",
    "however , corrections of the first order in @xmath98 should be also considered and are included below ( some of the terms with @xmath99 are further reduced by the presence of the emipirically small @xmath100 ) : @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103 where @xmath79 is the @xmath78 phase of eq .",

    "the observed values were closer to @xmath302 , which was viewed as an anomaly for many years . here again , although @xmath192-oscillations could clearly cause this anomaly there was not enough corroborative evidence to substantiate this explanation .    however , the situation dramatically changed in 1998 when the larger experiment , super - kamiokande , reported a clearly anomalous zenith angle dependence of the @xmath297 events @xcite .",
    "the measurements indicated a deficit of upward - going @xmath297-induced events ( produced @xmath303  km away at the opposite side of the earth ) relative to the downward - going events ( produced @xmath304  km above ) .",
    "the @xmath13 events displayed a normal zenith angle behavior consistent with monte carlo simulations .",
    "since at that time ( 1998 ) the solar-@xmath192 problem was still unresolved , these data represent the first really solid evidence for @xmath192-oscillations .",

    "most are still in the development stage , and of course the issue of backgrounds is critical in every case . since the source mass is @xmath184 100 times larger than in the present experiments , the background per unit mass must be correspondingly smaller .",
    "different proposals approach this issue differently , and in all cases substantial r&d is required .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that several experiments will be mounted during the next decade with the goal of studying @xmath449 with sensitivity below 30 mev .",
    "the table 2 lists the proposed experiments we are aware of , together with the claimed sensitivity to the @xmath239 halflife , and its crude translation into the sensitivity to the majorana mass .    among the listed experiments , a few relatively small scale searches are actually running ( cobra , nemo3 ) .",
    "others , particularly the ` ton size ' , will be mounted in stages with prototypes of 50 - 200 kg approved and funded at the present time for several of them ( one , cuoricino , the prototype of cuore , with 40 kg of natural te , is already running in gran sasso ) .",
    "clearly , the final decision as to which of these many ideas will be realized depends on the outcome of these prototype installations . nevertheless ,",
    "since they are still @xmath184 10 times larger than the present experiments , we can expect substantial improvement in sensitivity relatively soon .      in the near - term future",
    ", substantial additional information from cosmological observations will become available that will further constrain the sum of light neutrino masses @xmath450 compared to the limits quoted in _",
    "3.4_. already in progress is the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite that will map over @xmath451 galaxy redshifts and provide relative sensitivity in the relevant region of the power spectrum of @xmath452 .",
    "when combined with the wmap cmb data , this should provide sensitivity to @xmath453  ev @xcite .",
    "further in the future , higher precision measurements of the cmb anisotropies are expected from the planck mission ( now expected to be launched in 2007 ) @xcite .",
    "an estimate of the combined sensitivity ( @xmath454 ) of the expected planck data and the sdss observations to neutrino masses gives the result @xmath455  ev @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to envision what direction the study of neutrino mass and oscillations will take in the longer - term .",
    "thus , we can only offer educated guesses .    some of the future research will , obviously , depend on the results of the near - term future described in the preceding section . among the results that might force a revision of the experimental program are the miniboone tests of the lsnd evidence for the @xmath191 oscillations corresponding to @xmath456 ev@xmath178 , and the attempts to determine the mixing angle @xmath0 .",
    "if miniboone confirms the lsnd observation , many more experiments will be needed because the nature of the neutrino mixing matrix would be much richer ( more than just three active neutrinos or @xmath188 invariance violation ) than envisioned so far and summarized in table 1 .",
    "also , if it turns out that the mixing angle @xmath0 is relatively large , perhaps close to the present upper limit , the study of the possible @xmath78 invariance violation in the neutrino sector will become considerably easier and will proceed faster than if @xmath0 is very small .    in addition , neutrino astrophysics will undoubtedly advance .",
    "further studies of the solar neutrino spectrum will be conducted , and in particular the low energy part , the flux of the @xmath31be and @xmath179 neutrinos , will be likely determined in live counting experiments .",
    "these measurements will be valuable not only for the further refinement of the determination of the oscillation parameters @xmath332 and @xmath83 , but also for better understanding of solar energy production .",
    "moreover , with several experiments on - line , we can hope that in the near future the next galactic core collapse supernova will be observed by a variety of neutrino detectors .",
    "if that happens , the observation of sn1987a @xcite which launched this field of neutrino astrophysics , will be exceeded many times , and all components of the supernova neutrino spectrum will be observed . again , such observations would not only advance our knowledge of neutrino physics , but will offer a unique insight in the physics of the stellar core collapse .",
    "we also anticipate that during the next decade other applications of neutrino physics will become reality .",
    "for example , the observation of ` geoneutrinos ' , i.e. the @xmath16 emitted by the decay of radioactive u and th series in the earth crust @xcite would enable determination of the corresponding radiogenic heat generation and provide an important contribution to geophysics .",
    "another application is the measurement of the relic supernova flux : the diffuse flux resulting from past supernovae in the surrounding space , roughly up to redshift @xmath457 . by measuring this flux one can determine the average supernova rate over a substantial part of the visible universe ( for an estimate of the rate see e.g. @xcite ) .    at present ,",
    "neutrino telescopes have not yet seen the tev and higher energy neutrinos which likely accompany the production of cosmic rays with such energies .",
    "this might change in near future when the relatively small underground detectors are supplemented by much larger ones in open water or ice .",
    "observation of the direction of high energy neutrinos would considerably advance the study of the origin of high energy cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "it will also make it possible to search for neutrinos from annihilation of the so far hypothetical dark matter particles ( wimps ) .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this review to describe the projects being built or proposed ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "naturally , the whole field of particle physics will advance at the same time . with the launch of lhc one can imagine that the existence of the higgs boson will be experimentally confirmed , and its properties will be , at least crudely , determined .",
    "one can also hope that the quest for the understanding of the two main paradigm of present day physics , the nature of the ` dark matter ' and ` dark energy ' , responsible for most of the energy density of the universe , will be advanced .",
    "these more general areas of particle physics could be , in fact , intimately related to the quest for neutrino mass and oscillations . taking the see - saw formula @xmath458 , and using for @xmath459 the neutrino mass scale @xmath18410 mev and for @xmath460 the electroweak symmetry breaking mass scale @xmath184 100 gev , we arrive at @xmath461 gev , i.e. close to the gut unification mass scale .",
    "if that relation could be firmed up , we will arrive at another determination of that important mass scale .",
    "the relation of the neutrino mass scale to the ` dark energy ' is based on the , perhaps accidental , numerical coincidence .",
    "remembering that the energy density of the ` dark energy ' is about @xmath462 ev / cm@xmath30 and rewriting it in the ` natural units ' as @xmath464 we arrive at the dark energy mass scale @xmath465 2 mev , close to the neutrino mass scale , and unlike any other mass scale in particle physics .",
    "( for recent attempts to relate these two mass scales see e.g. , @xcite . )",
    "future large scale projects to generate powerful new beams of neutrinos are already envisioned . to explore the possibility of @xmath78 violation in the lepton sector one would like to have a well - understood and collimated neutrino beam of a well defined flavor and energy spectrum .",
    "such a beam could be aimed at a distant large detector .",
    "recently it has been pointed out that technology exists to construct pure @xmath13 and @xmath16 beams of the required properties .",
    "accelerating radioactive ions , @xmath466he ( @xmath467 mev , @xmath468s , produces @xmath16 ) or @xmath469ne ( @xmath470 mev , @xmath468s , produces @xmath13 ) to @xmath471 , would produce beams of precisely known energy profile extending to @xmath472 , and collimated to @xmath473 .",
    "the oscillation signature in the far away detector would be the appearance of @xmath338 or @xmath474 @xcite .",
    "it is expected that @xmath475 decays per year can be achieved .",
    "the beams of @xmath109 and @xmath110 as well as @xmath13 and @xmath16 neutrinos could be obtained in a neutrino factory where accelerated muons are stored in a ring with long straight sections .",
    "such a beam will produce neutrino beams with equal mixtures of @xmath110 and @xmath13 if @xmath338 are stored , and @xmath109 with @xmath16 if @xmath474 are stored .",
    "it is expected that neutrino factories could provide @xmath476 useful muon decays per year .",
    "neutrino factories would thus provide beams with small systematic uncertainties in the beam flux and spectrum .",
    "@xmath78 violation , and determination of @xmath387 even if it is as small as @xmath477 can be achieved with such beams and baselines of several thousand km @xcite .",
    "one indication of the importance of the study of neutrinos is the recent report `` facilities for the future science , a twenty - year outlook '' ( see http://www.sc.doe.gov/ ) .",
    "it lists two projects , among the 28 listed in all fields supported by the us department of energy , relevant to the present topic , the study of double beta decay in underground detectors treated among the mid - term projects and super neutrino beam treated as a far - term project .",
    "clearly there are high expectations in the community of particle physicists that experiments with neutrinos will continue to provide new insights and substantial progress in the coming decades .",
    "construction and operation of the required facilities will be challenging , but the potential rewards are great , and a large and talented community of physicists is poised to embark on this unique and interesting journey .",
    "we would like to thank felix boehm for encouragement and inspiration resulting from his long and pioneering search for neutrino oscillations at nuclear reactors .",
    "we thank john beacom and gerry garvey for reading the manuscript and for helpful comments .",
