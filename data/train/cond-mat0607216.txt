    "the problem of quantum states of an electron subject to both periodic potential and homogeneous magnetic field remains to be actual for several last decades .",
    "there are various approaches and models for periodic potential and different approximations which are used for investigations of these states ( see , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . however , the spin - orbit interaction is usually excluded from the models as well as the zeeman term .",
    "such approach can be justified as long as the amplitude of the periodic potential is big enough to make the landau level splitting much greater than the typical spin - orbit coupling energy and the zeeman term . at the same time , under the realistic experimental conditions with 2d electron gas subject to the potential of lateral superlattice the potential amplitude @xmath0 can be of the same order as the spin - orbit ( so ) rashba coupling .",
    "for example , in recent papers  @xcite where a pioneering step into experimental observation of 2d magnetic bloch states has been done , the magnitude of @xmath0 was around 1 - 5 mev . in semiconductors structures with large so coupling  @xcite",
    "the typical splitting energy can be of the same order as @xmath0 .",
    "in this paper we study magnetic bloch states of 2d electrons subject to both periodic potential of a lateral superlattice and perpendicular magnetic field under the conditions when the so coupling and zeeman term should be taken into consideration .",
    "the energy band structure is calculated in the magnetic brillouin zone ( mbz ) and the magnetic bloch states are constructed .",
    "also , the spin density distribution in the elementary cell is obtained and the average spin polarization in a state with given quasimomentum are calculated .",
    "it is shown that the consideration of spin - orbit coupling is necessary for interpretation of realistic experiments .",
    "we consider 2d electron gas with spin - orbit rashba coupling in a potential @xmath1 which is periodic in plane with the period @xmath2 , and in a uniform magnetic field @xmath3 perpendicular to the plane of the electrons .",
    "the correspondent one - electron hamiltonian has the following form : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a periodic potential , @xmath6 is the rashba hamiltonian of an electron in uniform magnetic field  @xcite . here , @xmath7 are the momentum operator components , @xmath8 is the electron effective mass , @xmath9 are the pauli matrices , @xmath10 is the parameter of the so coupling , @xmath11 is the zeeman factor , and @xmath12 is the bohr magneton .",
    "we use the landau gauge in which the vector potential has the form @xmath13 and consider the potential @xmath14 .",
    "the quantum states structure of the system under consideration depends crucially on the parameter @xmath15 ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 are prime integers ) which is the number of flux quanta per unit cell , and @xmath18 is the flux quanta .",
    "one can express the eigenfunction of hamiltonian ( 1 ) as a set of landau wave functions in the presence of the so coupling  @xcite .",
    "if we take @xmath19 to be the rational number , the two - component magnetic bloch function , analogous to the one - component magnetic bloch function of the paper  @xcite , can be written in the form @xmath20,\\hfill\\llap{(2)}\\cr}\\ ] ] where the spinors @xmath21}$ ] , @xmath22\\cr \\phi_s[\\xi_{\\ell n}]}$ ] and @xmath23\\cr -d_s\\phi_s[\\xi_{\\ell n}]}$ ] correspond to `` @xmath24 '' and `` @xmath25 '' branches of the spectrum of the hamiltonian @xmath26  @xcite , @xmath27 , @xmath28 $ ] is the simple harmonic oscillator functions , @xmath29 is the magnetic length , @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the cyclotron frequency . here quantum numbers",

    "note that the spinor wave function ( 2 ) is the eigenfunction of both the hamiltonian ( 1 ) and operator of magnetic translation and therefore it have to obey the following bloch - peierls conditions @xmath36 where @xmath37 is quasimomentum defined in the mbz @xmath38 so , the magnetic brillouin zone is the same as for charged spinless particle . at the limit of high magnetic fields the functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 are proportional to eigenspinors of pauli operator @xmath41 : @xmath42 and @xmath43 .    substituting eq.(2 ) in the schrdinger equation @xmath44",
    "we come to the infinite system of linear equations for coefficients @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in the case when periodic potential amplitude and spin - orbit coupling energy have the same order and the inequality @xmath47 takes place the system of linear equations",

    "this system has a form of generalized harper s equation .",
    "matrix elements @xmath55 and @xmath56 in the left upper block of eq.(3 ) characterize the interaction between different states of the `` @xmath24 '' branch and elements @xmath57 and @xmath58 in right low block are due to the interaction between states of the `` @xmath25 '' branch .",

    "so , each block has the size @xmath62 .",
    "numerical calculations of energy spectrum and wave functions were carried out for the actual parameters which approximately correspond to the structure used in the experiment . in our calculations",
    "we used the following parameters of 2d electron gas : @xmath63 , effective mass @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",

    "the corresponding spectrum structure in magnetic field becomes well resolved and so splitting is larger than zeeman splitting at @xmath68 .",
    "the chosen parameters approximately correspond to the inas quantum well where the rashba so constant can reach the maximal value @xmath69 due to electron wave function penetration into barrier layer  @xcite .    in fig.1",
    "we show the electron energy levels for the state @xmath70 versus the magnetic flux number .",
    "the big dots define the position of landau levels @xmath71 in the absence of periodic potential .",
    "the insert demonstrates the magnetic subbands at @xmath19 equal to @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 for @xmath37 located in the magnetic brillouin zone .",
    "the upper arrow marks the lowest magnetic subband for which the dispersion law @xmath75 is plotted in fig.2 .",
    "note that the spectrum of magnetic subbands has the symmetry of the @xmath76 group , as it should be .",
    "as one can see from fig.1 the periodic potential forms the spectra which resemble the hofstadter butterflies at the region @xmath77 . for @xmath78 the magnetic subbands split by so coupling and periodic potential are not overlapped .",
    "so , at magnetic fields corresponding to @xmath78 the unperturbed levels ( fat dots in fig.1 ) are grouped into pairs and , therefore , our two - branch approximation is appropriate .    to compare the effects of level splitting due to the periodic potential as well as zeeman effect and so coupling we calculated the energy spectra formed from the lowest pair of landau levels ( see fig.3 ) . in fig.3a",
    "we show the hofstadter - like spectrum in the absence of zeeman and so interactions . here , all levels are two - fold degenerate . at the presence of zeeman interaction ( fig.3b )",
    "the degeneracy is lifted and the correspondent spectrum is the superposition of two hofstadter - like butterflies .",
    "fig.3c demonstrates the splitting due to the so rashba coupling .",
    "so , under the parameters and magnetic fields indicated above the so interaction is large enough to form two non - overlapped and non - degenerate groups of magnetic subbands .",
    "we have calculated also the electron density @xmath79 at @xmath80 for the fourth magnetic subband labelled by low arrow at the insert in fig.1 . at the center of mbz",
    "it has the symmetry of the @xmath76 group .",
    "note , that for the state @xmath81 the electron density does not possess the symmetry of the lattice .",
    "in the 2d electron gas with spin - orbit coupling at the presence of the periodic potential and perpendicular magnetic field the non - trivial spin structure appears in each of magnetic energy bands .",
    "such a structure at a certain @xmath37 can be characterized by the vector field of the spin density in coordinate space @xmath82 in addition , spin states can be characterized by the average spin distribution in @xmath37 space @xmath83 where the brackets mean the integration on @xmath84 and @xmath85 over the magnetic unit cell .    in fig.5",
    "we show the spin density distribution calculated in the @xmath86-space for the square superlattice with parameters indicated above .",
    "all results correspond to the fourth magnetic energy band shown at the insert in fig.1 for the state @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath87 and @xmath88 densities have the @xmath89 symmetry , but the @xmath90 component has the @xmath76 symmetry .",
    "the integration of the spin densities over the magnetic unit cell leads to the zero values of @xmath91 and @xmath92 at @xmath80 ( see fig.6a ) .",
    "the integration of @xmath90 over the magnetic unit cell results to the positive value of the average spin projection along magnetic field .    in fig.6",
    "we show the average spin polarization in the mbz for the fourth band at the magnetic flux @xmath93 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "fig.6a demonstrates the distribution of the components @xmath91 and @xmath92 and fig.6b shows the @xmath94 component .",
    "the distribution in fig.6a has the vortex structure with the @xmath95 symmetry .",
    "the vortex centers are located at the center and at the corners of mbz .",
    "these two vortices have opposite directions of rotation . in these points",
    "the average lateral spin components are smaller than perpendicular component @xmath94 . for the state @xmath80 such",
    "a behavior is due to the small value of so coupling in comparison with zeeman effect . at the corners of mbz the",
    "so coupling is effectively smaller than the spin splitting in a magnetic field as a result of state mixing at the magnetic brillouin zone edges . here",
    ", in accordance with normalizing condition the @xmath96 component has the local maxima .",
    "we would like to note here that these spin vortices define the berry phases and , respectively , the spin hall conductance . due to the same fact of state mixing by periodic potential",
    "the so coupling effectively vanishes at the points where the edges of mbz cross the @xmath97 and @xmath98 lines .",
    "finally , note that the total magnetic moment of 2d electron gas which completely occupies this zone is positive .",
    "we have considered the effects of spin - orbit coupling on the quantum states of two - dimensional electron gas at the presence of periodic potential and uniform magnetic field .",
    "the hofstadter butterfly - like energy band spectrum and electron density in the unit cell was analyzed .",
    "we demonstrate that the zeeman interaction and the spin - orbit coupling form a complex and intricate spin periodic structure in the field of the lateral superlattice . the electron spin densities",
