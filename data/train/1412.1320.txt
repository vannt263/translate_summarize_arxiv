    "any such bifunctor has unit @xmath30 by proposition  [ prop : unit ] .",
    "such bifunctors correspond to double cocategories as in in which the top and left cocategories @xmath125 and @xmath126 are isomorphic to @xmath127 .",

    "each cocategory in @xmath128is a co - equivalence relation and , consequently , the co - kernel pair of its equaliser .",
    "we sketch the proof . to begin with , given a cocategory @xmath79 in @xmath128as in , one should show that the maps @xmath129 are jointly epi . the pushout projections @xmath130 certainly are , so given @xmath131 there exists @xmath132 such that @xmath133 or @xmath134 .",

    "a morphism of cocategories @xmath146 corresponds to a function @xmath147 between equalisers , and a unique such exists just when @xmath148 . since @xmath149 is the co - kernel pair of its equaliser it follows that @xmath150 and that @xmath151 for @xmath152 .",
    "since each cocategory present in a double cocategory comes equipped with a map to either its top or left cocategory it follows that :    [ cor : setdbl ] there exists only one double cocategory in @xmath128whose left and top cocategories coincide as the cocategory @xmath153 ; namely the cartesian product @xmath154 .    by proposition",
