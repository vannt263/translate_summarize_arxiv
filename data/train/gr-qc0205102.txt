    "in newtonian theory a self - gravitating incompressible fluid body rotating at a moderate velocity around a fixed axis with respect to some inertial frame takes the shape of a maclaurin ellipsoid , which is axisymmetric with respect to the rotation axis . for a higher rotation rate ,",
    "namely when the ratio of kinetic to gravitational potential energy @xmath6 is larger than @xmath7 , another figure of equilibrium exists : that of a jacobi ellipsoid , which is triaxial and rotates around its smallest axis @xcite . actually the jacobi ellipsoid is a preferred figure of equilibrium , since at fixed mass and angular momentum , it has a lower total energy @xmath8 than a maclaurin ellipsoid , due to its greater moment of inertia @xmath9 with respect to the rotation axis .",
    "indeed , at fixed angular momentum @xmath10 , the kinetic energy @xmath11 is a decreasing function of @xmath9 , and for large values of @xmath10 , this decrease overcomes the effect of the gravitational potential energy @xmath12 , which increases with @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , provided some mechanism acts for dissipating energy while preserving angular momentum ( for instance viscosity ) , a maclaurin ellipsoid with @xmath13 will break its axial symmetry and migrate toward a jacobi ellipsoid @xcite .",
    "this is the secular `` bar mode '' instability of rigidly rapidly rotating bodies .",
    "the qualifier _ secular _ reflects the necessity of some dissipative mechanism to lower the energy , the instability growth rate being controlled by the dissipation time scale , the maclaurin spheroids are subject to another instability , which is on the contrary _ dynamical _ , i.e. it develops independently of any dissipative mechanism and on a dynamical time scale ( one rotation period ) . ] . as shown by christodoulou et al .",
    "@xcite , the jacobi - like bar mode instability appears only if the fluid circulation is not conserved . if on the contrary , the circulation is conserved ( as in inviscid fluids submitted only to potential forces ) , but not the angular momentum , it is the dedekind - like instability which develops instead . the famous chandrasekhar - friedman - schutz ( cfs ) instability ( see @xcite for a review ) belongs to this category .",
    "the jacobi - like bar mode instability , applied to neutron stars , is particularly relevant to gravitational wave astrophysics .",
    "indeed a jacobi ellipsoid has a time varying mass quadrupole moment with respect to any inertial frame , and therefore emits gravitational radiation , unlike a maclaurin spheroid . for a rapidly rotating neutron star ,",
    "the typical frequency of gravitational waves ( twice the rotation frequency ) falls in the bandwidth of the interferometric detectors ligo and virgo currently under construction .",
    "neutron stars being highly relativistic objects , the classical critical value @xmath14 , established for incompressible newtonian bodies , can not a priori be applied to them .",
    "the aim of the present article is thus to investigate the effect of general relativity on the secular bar mode instability of homogeneous incompressible bodies .",
    "we do not discuss compressible fluids here .",
    "it has been shown that compressibility has little effect on the triaxial instability @xcite .",
    "chandrasekhar @xcite has examined the first order post - newtonian ( pn ) corrections to the maclaurin and jacobi ellipsoids , by means of the tensor virial formalism .",
    "this work has been revisited recently by taniguchi @xcite .",
    "however , these authors have not computed the location of the maclaurin - jacobi bifurcation point at the 1-pn level .",
    "this has been done only recently by shapiro & zane @xcite and di girolamo & vietri @xcite .    on the numerical side , bonazzola , frieben & gourgoulhon @xcite",
    "have investigated the secular bar mode instability of rigidly rotating compressible stars in general relativity . in the newtonian limit",
    ", they recover the classical result of james @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , namely that , for a polytropic equation of state , the adiabatic index must be larger than @xmath15 for the bifurcation point to occur before the mass shedding limit ( keplerian frequency ) . in the relativistic regime",
    ", they have shown that general relativistic effects stabilize rotating stars against the viscosity driven triaxial instability .",
    "in particular , they have found that @xmath16 is an increasing function of the stellar compactness , reaching @xmath17 for a typical neutron star compaction parameter .",
    "this stabilizing tendency of general relativity has been confirmed by the pn study of shapiro & zane @xcite and di girolamo & vietri @xcite mentioned above .",
    "note that this behavior contrasts with the cfs instability , which is strengthened by general relativity @xcite .      in this paper",
    ", we improve the numerical technique over that used by bonazzola et al . @xcite by introducing surface fitted coordinates , which enable us to treat the density discontinuity at the surface of incompressible bodies .",
    "indeed the technique used in refs .",
    "@xcite did not permit to compute any incompressible model .",
    "in particular , it was not possible to compare the numerical results in the newtonian limit with the classical maclaurin - jacobi bifurcation point .",
    "we shall perform such a comparison here .",
    "the very good agreement obtained ( relative discrepancy @xmath18 ) provides very strong support for the method we use for locating the bifurcation point and which is essentially the same as that presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "the analytical formulation of the problem , including the approximations we introduce , is presented in sec .",
    "[ s : basic ] .",
    "section  [ s : num ] then describes the numerical technique we employ , as well as the various tests passed by the numerical code .",
    "the numerical results are presented in sec .",
    "[ s : cal ] , as well as a detailed comparison with the pn studies @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ s : summ ] provides some summary of our work .",
    "let us consider a rotating star that is steadily increasing its rotation rate , e.g. by accretion in a binary system .",
    "before the triaxial instability sets in , the spacetime generated by the rotating star can be considered as _",
    "stationary _ and _ axisymmetric _ , which means that there exist two killing vector fields , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , such that @xmath19 is timelike ( at least far from the star ) and @xmath20 is spacelike and its orbits are closed curves .",
    "when the axisymmetry of the star is broken , the stationarity of spacetime is also broken . in newtonian theory , there is no inertial frame in which a rotating triaxial object appears stationary , i.e. does not depend upon the time .",
    "it can be stationary only in a corotating frame , which is not inertial , so that the stationarity is broken in this sense .",
    "the stationarity in the corotating frame can be expressed geometrically by stating that the newtonian spacetime possesses a one - parameter symmetry group , whose integral curves are helices .",
    "a generator of this symmetry group thus has the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are respectively the time and azimuthal coordinates associated with an inertial observer , and @xmath24 is the angular velocity with respect to the inertial frame .    in general relativity , a rotating triaxial system can not be stationary , even in the corotating frame , as it radiates away gravitational waves and therefore loses energy and angular momentum .",
    "however , at the very point of the symmetry breaking , no gravitational wave has yet been emitted . for sufficiently small deviations from axisymmetry , we may neglect the gravitational radiation .",
    "therefore we shall assume that the spacetime has a helical symmetry , as in the newtonian case .",
    "the ( suitably normalized ) associated symmetry generator @xmath25 is then a killing vector , which can be written in the form ( [ e : helical ] ) in weak - field regions ( spacelike infinity ) .",
    "note that spacetimes with helical symmetry have been also used for describing binary systems with circular orbits @xcite .",
    "we model the stellar matter by a perfect fluid , for which the stress - energy tensor takes the form @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the fluid 4-velocity , @xmath28 the fluid proper energy density , @xmath29 the fluid pressure and @xmath30 the spacetime metric tensor .",
    "a rigid motion is defined in relativity by the vanishing of the expansion tensor @xmath31 of the 4-velocity @xmath27 . in presence of the killing vector @xmath25 ,",
    "this can be realized by requiring the colinearity of @xmath27 and @xmath25 ( supposing that the fluid occupies only the region where @xmath25 is timelike ) : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a scalar field related to the norm of @xmath25 by the normalization of the 4-velocity @xmath34 .    for a perfect fluid at zero temperature , the momentum - energy conservation equation @xmath35 can be recast as @xcite @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the proper baryon number density and @xmath39 is the momentum 1-form @xmath40 , @xmath41 being the fluid specific enthalpy : @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is some mean baryon mass . in eq .",
    "( [ e : canon ] ) , @xmath44 denotes the exterior derivative of @xmath39 , the so - called _",
    "vorticity 2-form _ @xcite . for the rigid motion we are considering ,",
    "the baryon number conservation equation ( [ e : conserv ] ) is automatically satisfied , thanks to the colinearity of @xmath27 with the symmetry generator @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , the equation of motion  ( [ e : canon ] ) can be reduced to a first integral .",
    "indeed cartan s identity applied to the lie derivative of the 1-form @xmath39 along the vector field @xmath25 leads to @xmath45 where the second equality holds thanks to the helical symmetry : @xmath46 . inserting relation ( [ e : rigid ] ) into the equation of fluid motion ( [ e : canon ] ) shows that the first term in eq .",
    "( [ e : cartan ] ) vanishes identically , so that one gets the first integral of motion @xcite @xmath47 in the axisymmetric and stationary case , where @xmath25 is a linear combination of the two killing vectors [ eq .",
    "( [ e : ell_axi ] ) below ] , one recovers the classical expression @xcite .",
    "the first integral ( [ e : int_prem_rigid ] ) can be re - expressed in terms of the 3 + 1 formalism of general relativity .",
    "let us introduce the spacetime foliation by the @xmath48 hypersurfaces @xmath49 and the associated future - directed unit vector field @xmath50 everywhere normal to @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 is the 4-velocity of the so - called _ eulerian observer _ ( also called _ zamo _ or _ locally non - rotating observer _ ) .",
    "we have the following orthogonal split of the fluid 4-velocity : @xmath51 with the lorentz factor @xmath52 the spacelike vector @xmath53 is the fluid 3-velocity as measured by the eulerian observer and the second equality in the above equation results from the normalization of the 4-velocity @xmath27 .",
    "similarly , we have an orthogonal split of the helical killing vector : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the lapse function , governing the proper time evolution between two neighboring hypersurfaces @xmath49 . from relation ( [ e : rigid ] ) and the two orthogonal decompositions ( [ e : u_ortho ] ) and ( [ e : ell_ortho ] ) , we get @xmath56 , so that the ( logarithm of the ) first integral ( [ e : int_prem_rigid ] ) can be written @xmath57 with @xmath58 in the non - relativistic limit , @xmath59 tends toward the classical specific enthalpy ( excluding the rest - mass energy ) of the fluid , whereas @xmath60 tends toward the newtonian gravitational potential .",
    "therefore , in the newtonian limit , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 , eq .",
    "( [ e : int_prem ] ) reduces to the classical first integral of motion @xmath63      when the rigidly rotating star is still stationary and axisymmetric , it is well known that a coordinate system @xmath64 can be chosen so that the metric takes the papapetrou form ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) @xmath65 where @xmath55 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are four functions of @xmath69 .",
    "the coordinate vectors @xmath70 and @xmath71 are then the two killing vectors @xmath19 and @xmath20 mentioned in sec .",
    "[ s : helic ] .",
    "the helical killing vector @xmath25 is expressible as @xmath72 with the form ( [ e : metric_axi ] ) , the einstein equations reduce to a set of four coupled elliptic equations ( see e.g. @xcite for the precise form ) .",
    "when the triaxial instability sets in , we shall consider that the metric is a perturbation of ( [ e : metric_axi ] ) , which we write as @xcite @xmath73 where @xmath55 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are six functions of @xmath76 , with @xmath77 note that @xmath70 and @xmath71 are no longer killing vectors , only @xmath25 remains killing .",
    "the coordinate system @xmath78 is adapted to the killing vector @xmath25 and @xmath22 is an ignorable coordinate in this system .",
    "we call @xmath79 the _ corotating _ coordinate system , and @xmath80 the _ nonrotating _ one .",
    "@xmath55 is the lapse function already introduced in eq .",
    "( [ e : ell_ortho ] ) .",
    "@xmath81 is ( minus . ] ) the _ shift vector _ of the nonrotating coordinate system .    in the triaxial case ,",
    "there is no equivalent of the papapetrou theorem @xcite which , in absence of convective motions ( in the meridional planes ) , allows one to set to zero all the off - diagonal components of the metric tensor of axisymmetric and stationary spacetimes , except for @xmath82 .",
    "so , in principle , all the metric components should be non - vanishing in eq .",
    "( [ e : metric_3d ] ) .",
    "however , we retained only @xmath83 and @xmath84 as the extra non zero components with respect to the axisymmetric case .",
    "we did so as an approximation in order to simplify the writing of einstein equations .",
    "this approximation can be justified by the following remarks : ( i ) the metric element ( [ e : metric_3d ] ) is exact in the stationary axisymmetric case , ( ii ) it encompasses the first order pn metric .",
    "this means that the neglected terms are of second order pn and moreover vanish for stationary axisymmetric rotating stars .",
    "we consider these terms to be negligible in our study of the verge of the non - axisymmetric instability .",
