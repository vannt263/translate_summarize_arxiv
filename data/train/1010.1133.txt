    "the classical isodiametric inequality in the euclidean space says that balls maximize the volume among all sets with a given diameter .",
    "this was originally proved by bieberbach  @xcite in @xmath1 and by urysohn  @xcite in @xmath2 , see also  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we are interested in the case of the heisenberg group @xmath3 equipped with its carnot - carathodory distance @xmath4 and with the haar measure @xmath5 ( see section  [ sec : heisenberg ] for the definitions ) . our aim is to study _ isodiametric sets _ , i.e. sets maximizing the measure among sets with a given diameter .    recalling that the homogeneous dimension of @xmath3 is @xmath6 , we define the isodiametric constant @xmath7 by @xmath8 where the supremum is taken among all sets @xmath9 with positive and finite diameter .",
    "sets realizing the supremum do exist , see  @xcite or theorem  [ thm : existence ] below . since the closure of any such set is a compact set that still realizes the supremum , we consider the class @xmath10 of compact isodiametric sets , @xmath11 in other words , due to the presence of dilations in @xmath3 , @xmath10 denotes the class of compact sets that maximize the @xmath5-measure among all sets with the same diameter .",
    "in contrast to the euclidean case , balls in @xmath12 are not isodiametric ( @xcite ) and we shall give in this paper some further and refined evidence that the situation is indeed quite different from the euclidean one .    before describing our main results let us recall some classical motivations and consequences coming from the study of isodiametric type problems .",
    "first the isodiametric constant @xmath7 coincides with the ratio between the measure @xmath5 and the @xmath13-dimensional hausdorff measure @xmath14 in @xmath12 , namely , @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "this can actually be generalized to any carnot group equipped with a homogeneous distance ( @xcite ) , and for abelian carnot groups one recovers the well - known euclidean situation .    as a consequence , the knowledge of the numerical value of the isodiametric constant @xmath7 , or equivalently the explicit description of isodiametric sets , gives non trivial information about the geometry of the metric space @xmath12 and about the measure @xmath14 which may be considered as a natural measure from the metric point of view .",
    "let us also mention that there are some links with the besicovitch 1/2-problem which is in turn related to the study of the connections between densities and rectifiability .",
    "see  @xcite for an introduction and known results about the besicovitch 1/2-problem and @xcite for the connection between the isodiametric problem in carnot groups and the besicovitch 1/2-problem .",
    "our main results in the present paper are a regularity property for sets in @xmath10 and a rather complete solution to a restricted isodiametric problem within the class of so - called rotationally invariant sets .",
    "let us first describe our regularity result .",
    "we shall prove that given @xmath17 then @xmath18 is still a compact isodiametric set with the same diameter as @xmath19 and with locally lipschitz boundary .",
    "more precisely , identifying @xmath3 with @xmath20 ( see section [ sec : heisenberg ] ) , we prove that @xmath21\\in { { \\mathbb{h}^n}}~;~z\\in \\overline u,~f^-(z)\\leq t \\leq f^+(z)\\}\\ ] ] for some open set @xmath22 in @xmath23 and some continuous maps @xmath24 , @xmath25 that are locally lipschitz continuous on @xmath22 .",
    "see theorem  [ thm : regisodiam ] for a complete statement .",
    "this regularity property will actually follow from a slightly more general result .",
    "we will prove that a set @xmath17 must satisfy the following necessary condition , @xmath26 see proposition  [ prop : neccdtrefined ] , and is @xmath27-convex , see subsection  [ subsec : geometric - transf ] for the definition of @xmath27-convexity and proposition  [ prop : tconv - isodiam ] . independently from the isodiametric problem , the property together with @xmath27-convexity turn out to imply the regularity properties sketched above . see theorem  [ thm : regboundary ] .",
    "as already mentioned , one knows that balls in @xmath12 are not isodiametric and isodiametric sets in @xmath12 are actually not explicitly known so far .",
    "this question turns out to be a challenging and rather delicate one .",
    "however , restricting ourselves to the family @xmath28 of so - called rotationally invariant sets , we are able to give a rather complete picture of the situation for compact isodiametric sets within this class",
    ". as we shall explain below , this picture will give some further information about the class @xmath10 .",
    "this may also hopefully give some insight towards a complete solution of the general isodiametric problem in @xmath12 .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath29 the class of compact sets in @xmath28 that are isodiametric within the class @xmath28 .",
    "see section  [ sec : isodiampb ] for the definition of the class @xmath28 and of this restricted isodiametric problem .",
    "first it is not hard to check that sets in @xmath29 satisfy and are @xmath27-convex , see proposition  [ prop : neccdtrefined ] and proposition  [ prop : tconv - isodiam ] , and hence satisfy the regularity properties of theorem  [ thm : regboundary ] .",
    "next our main specific result concerning sets @xmath30 is the characterization of their steiner symmetrization @xmath31 with respect to the @xmath23-plane ( see subsection  [ subsec : geometric - transf ] for the definition of @xmath31 ) .",
    "we prove that if @xmath30 then @xmath31 belongs to @xmath29 and has the same diameter as @xmath19 .",
    "moreover we prove that @xmath31 is actually uniquely determined once the diameter of @xmath19 is fixed , i.e. , @xmath32 for some peculiar set @xmath33 , see theorem  [ thm : rotisodiamsets ] .",
    "given @xmath34 , the set @xmath35 can be guessed via the following argument .",
    "one starts with the ball in @xmath12 centered at the origin and with diameter @xmath36 .",
    "as already said it does not satisfy .",
    "thus one can enlarge it around points where fails and get a set with still the same diameter but with greater measure .",
    "one can actually try to enlarge it as much as possible without increasing the diameter , remaining in the class @xmath28 , and preserving the property that it coincides with its steiner symmetrization with respect to the @xmath23-plane .",
    "in such a way , one ends up with a maximal set @xmath35 that satisfies .",
    "it turns out that this set is the closed convex hull ( in the euclidean sense when identifying @xmath3 with @xmath37 ) of the ball in @xmath12 centered at the origin and with diameter @xmath36 .",
