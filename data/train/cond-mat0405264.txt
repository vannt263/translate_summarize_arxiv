    "the formation of a coherent state remains a central problem in high-@xmath4 superconductivity .",
    "various unanswered and possibly contradictory issues are being debated concerning the nature of the pseudogap state ( pgs ) and its temperature onset.@xcite    in this paper , we focus on a quantitative analysis in the superconducting state ( scs ) . more precisely , we investigate the spectral weight @xmath5 , _ i.e. _ the area under the real part of the optical conductivity , defined as : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the frequency ( @xmath8 ) and temperature ( @xmath9 ) dependent conductivity , and @xmath10 is a cut - off frequency .",
    "the optical conductivity being related to the absorption , the spectral weight calculated up to @xmath10 reflects the number of states available for an optical transition up to this energy .",
    "it has been known for a long time that there is a noticeable loss of spectral weight in the optical conductivity when high @xmath4 materials enter the scs .",
    "one key issue is the energy scale over which this loss of spectral weight occurs .",
    "it is indeed related to the excitations responsible for pairing .",
    "this loss of spectral weight occurs because as superconductivity sets in , single qp states are suppressed and the associated weight is transferred into the zero frequency peak associated with the superfluid condensate .",
    "more precisely , the ferrell - glover - tinkham ( fgt ) sum rule @xcite requires that the spectral weight @xmath11 lost when decreasing the temperature from the normal state into the superconducting state , must be retrieved in the spectral weight @xmath12 of the @xmath13 function centered at zero frequency .",
    "the sum rule is exact if integrating up to infinity , and results merely from charge conservation . actually , the sum rule is satisfied ( @xmath14 ) provided the integration is performed up to a large enough value @xmath15 . in conventional superconductors",
    ", @xmath16 is typically @xmath17 , or about @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the superconducting gap).@xcite @xmath16 is considered to be a characteristic energy of the boson spectrum responsible for the pairing mechanism . would cuprates display this conventional behavior , then taking a typical maximum gap magnitude ( in a d - wave superconductor ) @xmath20 of 25 mev yields @xmath21  ev.@xcite indeed , from conventional bcs theory , including strong electron - phonon coupling , the amount of violation of the fgt sum rule is of the order of @xmath22 for @xmath23 , hence negligible.@xcite    an apparent violation of the sum rule , i.e. @xmath24 when integrating up to 0.1 ev was observed from interlayer conductivity data : exhausting the sum rule could then require an anomalously large energy scale , which was suggested to be related to a change of interlayer kinetic energy when the superfluid builds up.@xcite although early measurements yielded conventional _ in - plane _ energy scales @xcite , the decrease of the _ in - plane _ kinetic energy , suggested long ago as a possible pairing mechanism in the framework of the hole undressing scenario,@xcite was given renewed interest.@xcite indeed , later ellipsometric measurements and ir reflectivity experiments@xcite showed that in - plane spectral weight was lost up to the visible range . the key issue which has to be addressed experimentally is whether this spectral weight is transferred into the condensate.@xcite    the data presented in this paper report the investigation of the fgt sum rule in three carefully selected thin films from the bi-2212 family , probing three typical locations in the phase diagram : the underdoped ( und ) , the optimally doped ( opt ) and the overdoped ( ovr ) regime .",
    "a detailed study allows to work out with well controlled error bars the fgt sum rule and the spectral weight changes .",
    "we find that within these error bars , retrieving the condensate spectral weight in the ovr and opt samples requires integrating up to an energy of the order of 0.1  ev ( 800 @xmath25 ) , _ i.e. _ a conventional energy scale . in the und sample , about 20% of the fgt sum rule is still missing at 1  ev , and the integration must be performed up to at least 16000 @xmath26 ( 2  ev ) , an energy scale much larger than typical boson energies in a solid , and @xmath27 times larger than the maximum gap .",
    "we derive the associated change of the in - plane kinetic energy , which turns out to agree with some theoretical calculations.@xcite this paper supplements our previous report on the fgt sum rule,@xcite by developing in detail the investigation on the spectral weight distribution in the superconducting state , and by presenting the details of the analysis of the thin - film reflectivity and of the uncertainties .",
    "the paper is divided as follows : after a presentation of the experimental results , we will perform the analysis of the data in terms of the partial spectral weight and the fgt sum rule as a function of the cut - off frequency .",
    "we will give an interpretation of the results in terms of a change of the in - plane kinetic energy .",
    "in the appendix , we describe the sample fabrication , characterization and selection , and the experimental set - up .",
    "then , we discuss the procedure to derive the optical functions from the reflectivity of a film deposited onto a substrate , giving a detailed account of the experimental uncertainties arising from this procedure , and explaining how we incorporated the uncertainties associated with the low temperature extrapolation of the normal - state spectral weight ( which is required to compute correctly the fgt sum rule ) into the total error bars .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > \" , ]",
    "in conclusion , we have found for the in - plane conductivity of the underdoped bi-2212 a clear violation of the fgt sum rule at 1  ev , corresponding to a large ( @xmath28  % ) transfer of spectral weight from regions of the visible spectrum to the superfluid condensate . within the framework of the tight - binding hubbard model",
    ", this corresponds to a kinetic energy lowering of @xmath29  mev per copper site .",
    "the very large energy scale required in order to exhaust the sum rule in the underdoped sample can not be related to a conventional bosonic scale , hence strongly suggests an electronic pairing mechanism .",

    "even if infrared and visible spectroscopy measures the bulk optical properties of cuprates ( the infrared skin - depth of bi-2212 is @xmath30   ) , a flat surface of high optical quality _ in the whole measured spectral range _ is an important requirement for the accuracy in the measurement of the _ absolute _ value of the reflectivity . besides checking our samples under an optical microscope",
    ", we characterized the _ mid - infrared _ optical quality of our films by infrared microscopy at room temperature , using the infrared microscope of the mirage beamline at lure ( orsay).@xcite in this microscope , the light being focussed on a point on the sample has been previously analyzed by a fourier transform spectrometer . in this way",
    ", the infrared reflectivity spectrum for each measured point is available . in our case",
    ", we worked at a spatial resolution of 20  @xmath31 m . we then made , for each sample , scans over zones typically @xmath32  @xmath31m@xmath33 , recording for each measured point the spectrum in the @xmath34 $ ]  @xmath25 range .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] illustrates the cases of a good ( left ) and a bad ( right ) optical quality in the mid - infrared [ the figure in the right corresponds actually to the ybco thin film , with a @xmath35  k ] .",
    "we found , not surprisingly , that a defect whose size is comparable to the infrared wavelength ( @xmath36  @xmath31 m ) , and that is easily spotted with the visible microscope ( picture in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , right ) , can perturb drastically the local reflectivity spectra .",
    "( we have not , on the other hand , found any case where a smooth region in the optical microscope was defective under the infrared microscope ) .",
    "if the ensemble of these infrared - defective regions represents a few percent of the total sample surface , then the _ average _ reflectivity of the whole surface will not accurately represent the _ intrinsic _ value of the absolute reflectivity of the sample ( _ i.e. _ , the average reflectivity over the whole surface will differ by more than 1% from the actual value of the reflectivity one would obtain with a sample of the same doping characteristics but with a surface free of defects ) .",
    "our characterizations show as well that the infrared spectra are not sensitive to sub - micronic defects , whose size is comparable to the wavelengths in the visible ( fig .  [ fig7 ] , left ) .",
    "a first screening of the samples was done based on their resistive , optical - microscopy and @xmath31ir characteristics .",
    "we selected the samples showing a metallic behavior in the normal state , having the narrowest transitions ( @xmath28  k to @xmath37  k for und to ovr , respectively ) , homogeneous under the optical microscope , and displaying homogeneous @xmath31ir charts .",
    "the reflectivity spectra of the samples thus selected were adjusted to obtain their conductivities , using a fitting procedure that will be discussed in the next section . in this fitting procedure ,",
    "the thickness of the sample enters as a parameter .",
    "samples whose measured thickness differed by more than 15% ( the accuracy of rbs measurements on bi-2212 ) from the thickness needed to adjust the measured reflectivity were discarded .",
    "samples showing abnormal electronic behavior ( _ e.g. _ , localized states at low frequency , or a temperature dependence of the low - frequency conductivity not matching the dc measurements ) were discarded as well . at the end ,",
    "three samples having passed confidently all the screenings , and spanning the three different doping regions , were selected for a thorough analysis .",
    "the critical temperatures ( doping ) of the selected films are 70  k ( und ) , 80  k ( opt ) and 63  k ( ovr ) .",
    "the thickness of the films is an important issue : it is needed to deduce the intrinsic optical functions of the bi-2212 despite the presence of a substrate which modifies the overall reflectivity .",
    "after the optical measurements were completed , the thickness of the b80kopt and b63kovr samples was directly verified by a second run of rbs measurements , yielding 395  nm and 270  nm ( @xmath38  nm ) respectively , in agreement with the thicknesses derived from fitting their reflectivities .",
    "the uncertainty of the rbs measurement ( larger than 10% ) is not quite satisfactory , since as discussed further , it is possible to change the assumed thickness within 10% and the incurred error bar is @xmath37% .",
    "the b70kund sample was crucial , and the rbs measurement on a film grown under the same conditions ( but on a mgo substrate ) yielded 220  nm , already in agreement ( within 10% ) with the thickness deduced from the fit .",
    "we therefore decided to try and achieve a better accuracy using a tem measurement , thus precluding a second rbs run .",
    "this attempt was unsuccessful .      among the various different models that we tried for a film on top of a substrate , we found that the best description of our raw reflectivity spectra is obtained by assuming that the light bouncing back and forth within the film interferes coherently and that the substrate has an infinite thickness ( no light is reflected from its rear face ) .",
    "the typical thickness of our films being 3000   , that of the substrate @xmath39  mm , the refractive index of the bi-2212 film ( f ) in the mid - infrared ( around 800  @xmath25 , for example ) being @xmath40 and that of the substrate ( s ) @xmath41 , one can deduce that , in this spectral range , the ratio  optical path  @xmath42  wavelength in the medium \" for a round - trip path of the light is about 0.24 for the bi-2212 , and @xmath43 for the substrate . on the other hand , even if the substrate is transparent in the near - infrared and the visible , its rear face in our films is not polished , so that the light is scattered from this face .",
    "the above - mentioned assumptions are thus largely justified on physical grounds .",
    "the interfaces playing a role in our model are thus helium bath - film ( hf ) and film - substrate ( fs ) .",
    "they are characterized by complex reflection [ @xmath44 and transmission [ @xmath45 coefficients from medium 1 ( refractive index @xmath46 ) to medium 2 ( refractive index @xmath47 ) .",
    "the refractive index of the helium bath around the sample is 1 . denoting by @xmath48 the complex reflection coefficient of our films ( the measured reflectivity being thus @xmath49 ) , and by @xmath50 the thickness of the film , and assuming a coherent interference within the film and an infinite substrate , one easily finds @xmath51 where @xmath52 $ ]",
    "therefore , when the complex refractive indices of the film and the substrate ( entering into the various coefficients @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) and the thickness of the film are known , one can describe the measured reflectivity @xmath55 .",
    "we have measured the reflectivity of a single crystal of srtio@xmath56 for all the temperatures and spectral range relevant to our work .",
    "we have thus at hand the optical functions of the substrate .",
    "hence , the measured reflectivity spectra can be adjusted by means of the eq .",
    "[ eq : reflec - thin - film ] by simulating only the refractive index of the bi-2212 .",
    "the choice of the essay functions to simulate @xmath57 is _ arbitrary _ , provided the chosen functions obey _ causality _ ( see next section ) .",
    "when the fitting is exact , this procedure yields the exact optical functions of the film alone , and the film thickness .",
    "the latter has been controlled by rbs measurements ( see main text ) .",
    "the uncertainties arising from the accuracy of the fit are discussed in the next section .",
    "if @xmath58 is the _ complete _ and _ exact _ reflectivity spectrum of a material , then the phase @xmath59 of the complex reflectance coefficient of the system can be deduced from a kramers - kronig transformation ( tkk ) on @xmath60 alone:@xcite @xmath61}{\\omega^{2}-\\omega_{0}^{2 } } d\\omega , \\label{eq : tkk}\\ ] ] this relation arises solely from the assumption of a linear and causal response of the system to the electromagnetic excitation .",
    "the knowledge of @xmath55 and @xmath62 allows the determination of any optical function @xmath63 by means of simple algebraic relations .",
    "we will write @xmath64 .",

    ", then the optical functions issued from this essay function are _ mathematically identical _ to those issued from a kramers - kronig transformation of @xmath60 . in other terms , _",
    "an exact fitting from zero to infinity with a causal function is completely equivalent to doing tkk_.    experimentally , the reflectivity is only known within a spectral range @xmath65 $ ] . besides , the reflectivity is never measured with zero uncertainty , neither in absolute value nor in its relative ( frequency- and/or temperature- ) variations .",
    "these two facts affect the accuracy in the determination of the optical functions ( either in the fitting or tkk cases ) , and are the departure point for the analysis of the uncertainties and errors in the determination of the optical functions of a system from its _ measured _ reflectivity . in the case of",
    "fitting , one additional source of error is the accuracy of the fitting within the measured frequency window .",
    "the uncertainty in the determination of an optical function at a given frequency depends on the uncertainty on the determination of the reflectivity at _ all _ the frequencies , as seen from relation  [ eq : tkk ] .",

    "the questions at stake in the analysis of the errors in the optical functions are thus :    1 .   given the maximum value @xmath68 that @xmath69 can take in a frequency range , what is the maximum error expected in the determination of the optical functions ?",

    "exact \" reflectivity , used as a model for a fitting or measure mismatch in the mid - infrared .",
    ", width=264 ]    to answer these questions , let us call @xmath73 the error , due to @xmath74 , in the determination of the phase of the reflectance coefficient .",
    "assuming that @xmath75 and @xmath76 are small compared to unity ( which is always true in the measured spectral range ) , then the relative errors in the determination of any optical function can be expressed in terms of @xmath55 , @xmath62 , @xmath77 and @xmath73 as : @xmath78 the dimensionless factors @xmath79 and @xmath80 are different for the different optical functions of a given system . in particular , for the conductivity , it can be shown that @xmath81 .",
    "besides , they have a complicated explicit dependence on @xmath60 and @xmath59 , so that , for a given optical function , their frequency - dependencies are different for systems with different reflectivities .",
    "hence , @xmath82 depends on the explicit form of the reflectivity spectrum , and the examination of the uncertainties in the determination of the optical functions has to be made on a case - by - case basis .",
    "while an analytical approach to the study of these uncertainties in the case of cuprates can be performed , the calculations involved are too lengthy ( though simple ; they can be found in reference  @xcite ) and yield too crude results . for a system with a non - trivial reflectivity spectrum like bi-2212 , it is far more reliable to perform some numerical simulations and to compare them with the analytical studies .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] shows a simplified typical reflectivity for bi-2212 .",
    "this reflectivity has been constructed by superposing a drude and various broad lorentz oscillators .",
    "it corresponds approximately to the reflectivity of an overdoped bi-2212 sample in the normal state .",
    "analyzing an overdoped - like reflectivity that is close to unity at low frequencies sets an upper limit , in this frequency range , to the errors incurred in the determination of the optical functions .",
    "let us then define a  gaussian perturbation \" @xmath83 ( center @xmath84 , half - width @xmath85 ) to this exact reflectivity : @xmath86}. \\label{eq : pertgauss}\\ ] ] this kind of perturbation represents reasonably well the type of errors expected when fitting the experimental reflectivity using drude and broad lorentz oscillators , as we have done in this work .",

    "this relative error is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , where it is clear that @xmath91 , and that the perturbation in the conductivity extends over a region of about 3 times that of @xmath92 .",
    "the latter example illustrates well the uncertainties endemic of a fitting procedure .",
    "two other kinds of uncertainties play a role in the determination of the optical functions from reflectivity data , and are to be considered whichever method ( tkk or fitting ) is used for analyzing the data .",
    "these are : the error in the absolute measurement of the reflectivity , and the effect on the measured window of the ( unknown ) low- and high - frequency response of the system ( the problem of the choice of extrapolations when doing tkk ) .    analytical studies and numerical simulations  @xcite show that , for a system like bi-2212 , and with an accuracy in the absolute measurement of the reflectivity of the order of 1% ( our case ) , the associated uncertainties in the conductivity become important ( 20% or more ) at frequencies below @xmath27  @xmath25 . on the other hand ,",
    "as this is a systematic error , it can be largely suppressed by comparing two conductivity curves of the same sample .",
    "this is precisely what is done in the evaluation of the fgt sum rule or in the calculation of the relative changes of spectral weight with temperature . besides , the comparison between the extrapolated zero - frequency conductivity and the resistivity ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) narrows the confidence range of the low - frequency conductivity .    as for the effects of the low- and high - frequency extrapolations ,",
    "the conclusion of our analysis and simulations is that they can perturb the determination of the optical functions up to ( at most ) twice the first measured frequency and down to ( at most ) @xmath93 of the last measured frequency .",

    "<S> the _ in - plane _ infrared and visible ( 3  mev3  ev ) reflectivity of bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 ( bi-2212 ) thin films is measured between 300  k and 10  k for different doping levels with unprecedented accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> the optical conductivity is derived through an accurate fitting procedure . </S>",
    "<S> we study the transfer of spectral weight from finite energy into the superfluid as the system becomes superconducting . in the over - doped regime </S>",
    "<S> , the superfluid develops at the expense of states lying below 60  mev , a conventional energy of the order of a few times the superconducting gap . in the underdoped regime , spectral weight is removed from up to 2  ev , far beyond any conventional scale . the intraband spectral weight change between the normal and superconducting state , </S>",
    "<S> if analyzed in terms of a change of kinetic energy is @xmath2  mev . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the condensation energy , this figure addresses the issue of a kinetic energy driven mechanism . </S>"
