    "the electroweak standard model @xmath0 contains quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) as a constitutive part .",
    "the running of the electromagnetic coupling  is determined by the theory as @xmath1 where ( 0)=@xmath2 is the sommerfeld fine structure constant , which has been measured to a precision of 3.7@xmath310@xmath4  @xcite ; @xmath5 positive arises from loop contributions to the photon propagator .",
    "the numerical prediction of electroweak observables involves the knowledge of ( ) , usually for @xmath6 0 .",
    "for instance , the knowledge of ( ) is relevant to the evaluation of quantities measured by the lep experiments .",
    "this is achieved by evolving  from = 0  up to the @xmath7-mass scale = . the evolution expressed by the quantity  receives contributions from leptons , hadrons and the gauge bosons .",
    "the hadronic contribution to the vacuum polarization , which can not be calculated from first principles , is estimated with the help of a dispersion integral and evaluated @xcite by using total cross section measurements of @xmath8 hadrons at low energies .",
    "therefore , any evolved value ( ) particularly for @xmath9 , is affected by uncertainties originating from hadronic contributions .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath10 induced by these data is as small as @xmath110.09 @xcite ; nevertheless it turned out @xcite that this limits the accurate prediction of electroweak quantities within the standard model , particularly for the prediction of the higgs mass .    while waiting for improved measurements from bepc , vepp-4 m and dafne as input to the dispersion integral , intense efforts are made to improve on estimating the hadronic shift @xmath12 , as for instance @xcite - @xcite , and to find alternative ways of measuring  itself .",
    "attempts have been made to measure ( ) directly , using data at various energies , such as measuring the ratio of @xmath13/@xmath14 @xcite or more directly the angular distribution of bhabha scattering @xcite .    in this article",
    "the running of  is studied using small - angle bhabha scattering .",
    "this process provides unique information on the qed coupling constant  at low _ space - like _ momentum transfer @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is related to the total invariant energy @xmath17 and to the scattering angle @xmath18 of the final - state electron .",
    "the small - angle region has the virtue of giving access to values of ( @xmath19 )  without being affected by weak contributions .",
    "the cross section can be theoretically calculated with a precision at the per mille level .",
    "it is dominated by the photonic @xmath19 channel exchange and the non - qed contributions have been computed  @xcite and are of the order of 10@xmath20 ( see table  [ tab : cross ] ) ; in particular , contributions from boxes with two weak bosons are safely negligible .    in general , the bhabha cross section is computed ( see sect .",
    "3 ) from the entire set of gauge - invariant amplitudes in both the @xmath21 and @xmath19 channels . consequently , two invariant scales @xmath21 and @xmath19 govern the process .",
    "the different amplitudes are functions of both @xmath21 and @xmath19 and also the qed coupling @xmath22 appears as @xmath23 resp .",
    "@xmath24 @xcite . however , the restriction of bhabha scattering to the kinematic regime of small angles results in a considerable simplification , since the @xmath21 channel then gives only a negligible contribution , as is quantitatively demonstrated in table  [ tab : cross ] .",
    "thus , the measurement of the angular distribution allows us indeed to verify directly the running of the coupling @xmath24 . for the actual calculations , @xmath25 and @xmath26 must be satisfied ( see sect .",
    "obviously , in order to manifest the running , the experimental precision must be adequate",
    ".    this idea can be realized by high - statistics experiments at @xmath14 colliders equipped with finely segmented luminometers , in particular by the lep experiments , given their large event samples , by slc and future linear colliders .",
    "the relevant luminometers cover the @xmath19-range from a few gev@xmath27 to order 100 gev@xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath19-dependence of the quantity ( @xmath19 )  ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : da ] ,  [ eq : t ] ) at small values of @xmath19 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : alfa ] .",
    "it shows the predicted running of  in the relevant space - like region .",
    "the figure is obtained using the program _",
    "alphaqed _ by jegerlehner @xcite . at low energies",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : alfadet ] )  is dominated by the contribution from the leptons ,    while with increasing energy also the contribution involving hadrons gets relevant .",
    "the region where hadronic corrections are critical is contained in the considered @xmath19-range .",
    "the experimental determination of the angular distribution of the bhabha cross section requires the precise definition of a bhabha event in the detector .",
    "the analysis follows closely the procedure adopted in the luminosity measurement , which is described in detail , for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite , and elaborates on the additional aspect related to the measurement of a differential quantity . to this aim the luminosity detector must have a sufficiently large angular acceptance and adequate fine segmentation .",
    "the variable @xmath19 ( eq .  [ eq : t ] ) is reconstructed on an event - by - event basis .",
    "the method to measure the running of @xmath22 exploits the fact that the cross section for the process can be conveniently decomposed into three factors  : @xmath28 as worked out in sect .",
    "all three factors are predicted to a precision of 0.1% or better .",
    "the first factor on the right - hand side refers to the effective bhabha born cross section , including soft and virtual photons according to ref .",
    "@xcite , which is precisely known , and accounts for the strongest dependence on @xmath19 .",
    "the vacuum - polarization effect in the leading photon @xmath19 channel exchange is incorporated in the running of @xmath22 and gives rise to the squared factor in eq .",
    "[ eq : meth ] .",
    "the third factor , @xmath29 , collects all the remaining real ( in particular collinear ) and virtual radiative effects not incorporated in the running of @xmath22 .",
    "the experimental data after correction for detector effects have to be compared with eq .",
    "[ eq : meth ] .",
    "the @xmath19 dependence is rather steep , thus migration effects may need attention .",
    "this goal is achieved by using a newly developed program based on the already existing semianalytical code nllbha @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of this code called  is given in sect.4 .",
    "it is convenient to confront the fully corrected measured cross section with the bhabha cross section , including radiative corrections in the factorized form given by eq .",
    "[ eq : meth ] .",
    "the physical cross section is infrared safe @xcite .",
    "this decomposition is neither unique nor dictated by a compelling physical reason ; rather it allows the separation of the different sources of @xmath19 dependence in a transparent way without introducing any additional theoretical uncertainty .",
    "the various factors are discussed one by one in the following subsections .",
    "the differential cross section @xmath30 is defined as  : @xmath31 the factor @xmath32 is the bhabha cross section in the improved born approximation , which , by definition , includes the running of @xmath22 . as seen explicitly in the formulae below ( eq .  [ eq : form_b ] ) the term @xmath33",
    "is not factorized completely in the improved born cross section . in order to have the factorized form of eq .",
    "[ eq : meth ] the @xmath19 channel contribution to the running of @xmath22 has been taken out . in this way , @xmath30 contains not only the usual born @xmath19 dependence , i.e. @xmath34 , but also some weaker @xmath19 dependences arising from @xmath21 channel amplitudes with vacuum polarization effects taken into account  @xcite , although numerically small as mentioned above .",
    "the improved born cross section for bhabha scattering within the electroweak standard model is precisely known ( see refs .",
    "the differential cross section @xmath35 differs from @xmath30 by the inclusion of those radiative corrections that affect only the propagator of the exchanged photon .",
    "they form a gauge - invariant subset of all radiative corrections and are shown explicitly .",
    "it is convenient to decompose @xmath35 into the contributions arising from the @xmath19 channel @xmath36 , the @xmath21 channel @xmath37 and their interference @xmath38 : @xmath39 where @xmath40 \\\\ b_i & = & 2\\frac{s}{t } ( 1+c)^2 \\biggl\\ { \\frac{1}{(1-\\pi(t))(1-\\pi(s ) ) } \\\\      & + & ( g_v^2+g_a^2)\\biggl(\\frac{\\xi}{1-\\pi(s)}+\\frac{\\chi}{1-\\pi(t)}\\biggr ) \\\\       & + & ( g_v^4 + 6g_v^2g_a^2+g_a^4)\\xi\\chi\\biggr\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath41 here @xmath21 is the total squared invariant mass , @xmath42 the electroweak mixing angle and @xmath18 the scattering angle between the initial and final electron with momentum @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively ( see ref .",

    "table  [ tab : fits ] demonstrates that for the case of the delphi setup ( see sect .  5 ) and assuming typical integrated luminosities , the statistical accuracy is sufficient to verify the running of @xmath22 for each of the three centre - of - mass energies .    equation  [ eq : run ] can be expanded in terms of @xmath46 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : da ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to consider @xmath47 rather than eq .",
    "[ eq : run ] , since in practice the integrated luminosity @xmath48 is not known .",
    "the two coefficients @xmath49 and @xmath50 are obtained from a linear fit and contain the information on both the data and theory .",
    "their interpretation is : @xmath51 the dependence on the integrated luminosity is given explicitly : obviously , one has @xmath52 = @xmath53 by comparing eqs .",
    "[ eq : run ] , [ eq : u_exp],[eq : exp ] .    in the ratio @xmath54 the dependence of the integrated luminosity drops out : @xmath55 the slope @xmath56 , the quantity of interest ,",
    "is then directly given by the ratio of the two experimentally measured quantities @xmath49 and @xmath50 , namely @xmath57 .",
    "the contribution of @xmath58 is small with respect to 1 and can be neglected .",
    "the accuracy of the slope is determined by @xmath59 , i.e. about 10% ( see table  [ tab : fits ] ) , which is far smaller than the absolute value of @xmath57 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath49 relates the integrated luminosity to @xmath46 at the average value of @xmath19 @xmath60 making use of @xmath61 as a priori knowledge the fitted @xmath49 can be used to derive the integrated luminosity , which is the standard procedure .",
    "the statistical precision is given by @xmath62 , which is of the order of 10@xmath63 .",
    "in addition , the hadronic contribution to @xmath64 ( see fig .  [ fig : alfadet ] ) may be deduced by subtracting the leptonic contribution , which is theoretically known precisely .",
    "the extraction of the hadronic contribution is only limited by the experimental precision .",
    "a novel approach to access directly and to measure the running of @xmath22 in the space - like region is proposed .",
    "it consists in analysing small - angle bhabha scattering .",
    "depending on the particular angular detector coverage and on the energy of the beams , it allows a sizeable range of the @xmath19 variable to be covered .",
    "the feasibility of the method has been put in evidence by the use of a new tool ,  , to calculate the small - angle bhabha differential cross section with a theoretical accuracy of better than 0.1% .    the information obtained in the @xmath19 channel",
    "can be compared with the existing results of the @xmath21 channel measurements .",
    "this represents a complementary approach , which is direct , transparent and based only on qed interactions and furthermore free of some of the drawbacks inherent in the @xmath21 channel methods .",
    "the method outlined can be readily applied to the experiments at lep and slc .",
    "it can also be exploited by future  colliders as well as by existing lower energy machines .",
