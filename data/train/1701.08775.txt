    "discrete combinatorial optimization problems can be encoded into minimizing the energy of classical ising - type hamiltonians@xcite and it has been proposed that adding quantum mechanics could help in finding the ground state of these frustrated ising system faster than any classical technique . one can define a suitable time - dependent quantum hamiltonian that connects an initial hamiltonian , whose ground state is easy to prepare , to the final classical ising hamiltonian . at sufficient low temperatures a quantum system undergoing such adiabatic relaxation reaches its ground state and solves the optimization problem .",
    "this technique is called quantum annealing ( qa)@xcite .    early numerical studies predicted qa  @xcite to be a competitive computational resource for solving spin glass problems , compared to its closely related classical counterpart , the simulated annealing ( sa ) algorithm  @xcite .",
    "however , so far no quantum speedup has been observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "the essential difference between these two heuristic methods relies on the type of fluctuations which drive the system away from the multiple local minima , occuring in rugged energy landscapes .",
    "quantum fluctuations are expected to give an advantage to quantum annealing in particular when the free energy landscape displays tall but narrow barriers .",
    "these are easier to tunnel through quantum - mechanically , compared to climbing over them by means of thermally activated escape events .    in qa",
    "the system closely follows the ground state of a time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath0 which at @xmath1 is dominated by a pure quantum fluctuation part @xmath2 whereas the final hamiltonian @xmath3 encodes only the cost function @xmath4 of the combinatorial optimization problem .",
    "the hamiltonian as a function of the time @xmath5 may read , in the case of simple linear annealing schedules , @xmath6    since random ensembles of hard problems are closely connected to spin glass models , we choose , for our tests , the problem hamiltonian as an ising spin glass @xmath7 where @xmath8 are pauli matrices , acting on spins @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the coupling between spins @xmath9 and @xmath11 , which are randomly uniformly distributed in a range @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "most qa studies so far employed a single type of the quantum term @xmath2 , a transverse - field ( tf ) @xmath13 where the @xmath14 operator acts locally on the spin index @xmath9 inducing quantum fluctuations .",
    "this is simplest to implement both in physical devices , such as the d - wave devices@xcite and in simulated quantum annealing ( sqa ) by means of quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods@xcite .",
    "however , as pointed out by ref .  , it is possible to choose also different types of quantum fluctuations operators @xmath2 .",
    "following ref .",
    "we define a two body fluctuation operator with ferromagnetic interactions ( fi ) as @xmath15 where _ i , j _ are nearest neighbours , so that the interaction is short - range .",
    "the adiabatic theorem states that the system follows the instantaneous ground state as long as the total annealing time @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the minimum energy gap from the ground state , which is encountered along the annealing run of eq .",
    "( [ e : qa ] )",
    ". it has been conjectured and shown for simple models , that employing quantum fluctuations beyond the tf term could be beneficial to avoid these small gap events @xcite , which are the bottlenecks of qa@xcite .",
    "another argument in support of this possibility is that , in eq .",
    "( [ e : hq ] ) , we are effectively adding a new schedule parameter @xmath18 which can be also optimized to increase the qa performance .",
    "moreover , it has been found that quantum annealing with transverse fails to identify all degenerate ground - state configurations , preventing a fair sampling of equally probable states@xcite .",
    "multi - spin quantum fluctuations could alleviate or possibly remove this issue .    in this paper",
    "we devise a qmc algorithm to perform sqa with this two - spin transverse ferromagnetic interaction .",
    "we note that the _ minus _ sign in front of @xmath18 makes this hamiltonian _",
    "stoquastic _ for @xmath19 .",
    "this means that it is sign - problem free and can thus be simulated by qmc methods . on the other hand ,",
    "the existence of a sign problem precludes the possibility to simulate the two spin transverse antiferromagnetic ( @xmath20 ) interaction@xcite within the same approach unless the graph of couplings is bipartite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows , in sect .",
    "[ s : qmc ] we describe the qmc algorithm , which is tested against exact results for small systems in sect .",
    "[ s : test ] . in sect .",

    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods are the only classical approaches for simulating quantum annealing on systems as large as the ones realized experimentally , which consider more than @xmath21 qubits .",
    "other numerical methods such as _ _ unitary evolution__@xcite scale exponentially with @xmath22 and are therefore limited to much smaller numbers of spins ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the most widely used qmc technique in the context of qa is _ path integral monte carlo ( pimc)_. pimc relies on the path integral formalism of quantum mechanics and samples the density matrix corresponding to the quantum hamiltonian @xmath24 by means of a classical hamiltonian @xmath25 on an extended system having an additional dimension , the _ imaginary time _ direction@xcite . the original transverse field quantum spin system is then mapped into a classical one , which can be simulated by standard metropolis monte carlo .    it has recently been shown @xcite that for tunneling through a barrier the pimc efficiency scales as a function of the system size as a physical qa would .",
    "this connection exists due to the fact that the tunneling rate in qmc and in the exact real - time quantum evolution scales in the same way , to leading order , as a function of the relevant parameters .",
    "this connection has two implications .",
    "the first is that a qmc annealing simulation is relevant for investigating the behaviour of a real quantum annealer , as long as it is stoquastic and the qmc simulations thus do not suffer from a sign problem .",
    "the second is that it makes qmc - sqa a competitive tool compared to qa in real devices , by precluding a scaling advantage of stoquastic qa over sqa ( cfn . also ref .  ) .    starting from this mapping , other _ quantum inspired _",
    "algorithms can be developed such as pigs , where open boundary conditions in imaginary time are used@xcite for further acceleration . in this case qmc",
    "represents only a classical optimization algorithm and the physical meaning of the simulation is lost .",
    "similarly , it has been recently shown that performing pimc away from the converged physical limit , provides a more efficient algorithm compared to the continuos time one@xcite .",
    "this can be also considered a _ quantum inspired _ algorithm .",
    "for this reason we focus here on implementing a discrete - time pimc algorithm rather than a continuos time pimc .",
    "the simplest metropolis algorithm performs _ local _ updates : one generates trial configurations by simply flipping one spin at a time . while this algorithm is ergodic , it can be very inefficient . for non - frustrated systems considerable improvements",
    "is obtained by cluster algorithms@xcite .",
    "they allow simultaneous flips of clusters of spins and are especially advantegeous when large scale fluctuations are important , usually around phase transitions , where local update algorithms slow down .",
    "standard cluster algorithms@xcite allow the clusters to grow without restrictions .",
    "while efficient for non - frustrated systems this approach breaks down for frustrated spin systems , as spin glasses . due to the frustration",
    "the clusters grow to fill a very large fraction of the lattice , if not the entire lattice .",
    "the clusters are then larger than the physical domains that should be flipped and the algorithm becomes inefficient@xcite .",
    "essentially the whole system freezes out and one flips almost all spins .",
    "therefore , in the context of sqa of spin glasses with transverse field an hybrid approach is usually employed , in which _ restricted _ clusters are built@xcite . here",
    ", local clusters can grow on a single site only in the imaginary time dimension , where there is no frustration . in this paper",
    "we employ the same strategy with an important modification . due to the non local nature of the two - spin interaction as",
    "can not restrict ourselves to strictly local clusters but allow a small extent in the spatial direction .",

    "we consider a ferromagnetic hamiltonian with homogeneous couplings @xmath28 in this discussion , defined on an arbitrary graph of @xmath22 sites connected by @xmath29 bonds ( the disordered case @xmath10 will be considered at the end ) : @xmath30 the generalization of the algorithm to spatially varying couplings is straightforward .",
    "we first identify the non - commuting pieces of this hamiltonian to perform a trotter breakup .",
    "this procedure is less straightforward compared to the transverse field case where the hamiltonian splitting was a trivial splitting @xmath31 .",

    "notice that this property would not hold in the transverse field case .",
    "the simplest monte carlo algorithm usually employs local updates , i.e. by proposing to flip one spin at a time .",
    "this is not a good choice for xx couplings as unconstrained single spin flips lead to forbidden plaquette configurations with zero weight .",
    "our strategy is therefore to implement directly a cluster mc algorithm which automatically avoids sampling of forbidden configurations and minimizes the autocorrelation times .",

    "we simply describe the outline of our optimized version for xx couplings , which , as it usually happens in most mc algorithms , can be divided in two steps : cluster formation and cluster flip .",

    "this set of weights @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) determines the shape and the size of the clusters .",

    "in particular , this probability is given by @xmath81 .",
    "for example , if we connect and flip the spins _ at the bottom _ of a type-1 plaquette , we obtain a type-4 plaquette .",
    "the flip of two spins inside a shaded plaquette always produce a different type of configuration , which is in turn a valid plaquette configuration , by construction .",
    "this is the main idea of the _ loop algorithm_. one needs to define every possible @xmath82 transition weight .",

    "we put this label on the bond above ( below ) site @xmath9 , if the direction was upward ( downward ) in imaginary time direction .",

    "the last issue concerns the existence of plaquettes having an odd number of spin up ( down ) , which fall outside the breakup selection rule of the xx loop algorithm .",
    "these plaquettes certainly occur if @xmath100 .",
    "since in our approximation we can encounter the @xmath14 operator only going vertically along the imaginary time direction , the decision rule can be adapted from the standard transverse field cluster algorithm@xcite in this case : suppose we are at site @xmath95 and we are proceeding upward , if there is not a @xmath14 operator already in place above @xmath95 , then we check whether the spin at @xmath101 is parallel to @xmath95 , or not . in the latter case",
    "we stop the cluster .",
    "finally we notice that , in the @xmath102 case , this algorithm does not reduce to the common tf algorithm for disordered systems@xcite , in which clusters are built only along the imaginary time direction , if a non - empty bond set @xmath67 is considered .",

    "we perform the simulations at different inverse temperatures @xmath145 , 40 , and 80 .",
    "we keep the trotter time - step @xmath146 , constant and close to convergence to the physical limit ( cfn .",
    "also fig .",
    "[ fig : glass_qa ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : glass_mini ] we observe that , for fixed @xmath61 and @xmath105 , tf and fi - sqa display different behaviour , as the two curves are not related by a trivial _ shift _ along the time axis .",
    "we notice that the fi driver always outperforms the standard tf , for sufficiently large annealing times , at each temperature , despite the larger complexity of the fi driver .",
    "interestingly , the lower is temperature , the larger is the difference between the fi and tf residual energies .",
    "surprisingly , performing the annealing at zero transverse field , @xmath26 , results in a drastic decrease of the performance .",
    "these observations can be explained in the following way : _",
    "i. _ for short annealing time , a large part of the residual energy can be recovered by simple one - flip moves , then the tf driver is more effective in eliminating the _ defects _ in the extended lattice . _",
    "ii . _ the pure two body driver hamiltonian @xmath147 is way less efficient in this regards , as the clusters are usually bigger and always closed in the extended lattice .",
    "therefore , the transverse - field operator is still an important ingredient for a qa driver hamiltonian .     as a function of total annealing time @xmath119 , renormalized in order to express the total theoretical computational effort of each run as in eq .",
    "( [ e : effort ] ) . here",
    ", the qmc algorithm employs unrestricted cluster updates .",
    "dashed lines indicate sqa with standard tf hamiltonian ( with @xmath135 ) , while continuos ones refer to fi - sqa , with annealing schedule given by eq .",
    "( [ e : annpath ] ) , with ( with @xmath136 , @xmath137 ) .",
    "each color ( orange , blue , and red ) labels different sqa setup , having diffent @xmath61 and @xmath105 .",
    "the fi hamiltonian always performs better , for sufficiently long @xmath119 , than the tf , within the same @xmath138 setup .",
    "[ fig : glass_loop ] ]    finally , we also check the performance using the global update algorithm . in this case",
    "the cluster can freely traverse the extended lattice .",
    "we consider the same system and perform the same set of simulations and show the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : glass_loop ] .",
    "we notice that the trend is preserved , although the annealing profiles are slightly different . in particular , the pure two - body driver performs significantly worse than the mixed fi - sqa , having both @xmath18 and @xmath106 non - zero .",
    "however , fi - sqa still outperforms tf - sqa for sufficiently long annealing times , as in the previous semi - local algorithm .",
    "interestingly , this global updates version of the algorithm displays a better efficiency compared to the previous approach .",
    "indeed such system size can be considered still small and the global update scheme does not suffer much from a critical slowing down .",
    "note though the non - monotonicity as a function of the annealing time compared to the tf ( cfn . also ref .  ) , which hints at inefficiencies of the global updates .",
    "this feature disappears when the average energy is used ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : glass_qa ] ) , instead of the lowest one among the trotter slices .",
    "in this last section we perform simulations indicative of the relative efficiency between the fi and tf operators in a real qa device instead of as a classical optimization algorithm .",
    "qmc is expected to reproduce the performance of physical qa for typical tunneling problems as discussed in refs .  .",
    "this time we take the continuous time limit by using a large enough number of time slices @xmath61 , and we measure the annealing time simply using the monte carlo steps , as the computational effort related to the different update scheme is not relevant for the study of the physical machine . moreover , following ref .",
    "we average the final energy over all the @xmath61 trotter slices . in fig .",
    "[ fig : glass_qa ] we observe the same trend as in sqa , where the fi operator eventually outperforms the tf at later stages of the annealing .     as a function of total annealing time @xmath119 for different operators and trotter slices",
    "@xmath61 .. here , the qmc algorithm employs the same restricted cluster updates for the different operators tf and fi . the annealing time is not renormalized taking into account the computational effort ( which is proportional to @xmath61 ) and we obtain the final energy by averaging over all the trotter slices .",
    "dashed lines indicate simulations with standard tf hamiltonian ( with @xmath135 ) , while continuos ones refer to the fi operator , with annealing schedule given by eq .",
    "( [ e : annpath ] ) , with ( with @xmath136 , @xmath137 ) .",
    "we use an inverse temperature @xmath148 and we check the continuos time limit convergence using @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "the fi hamiltonian always performs better , for sufficiently long @xmath119 , than the tf , within the same @xmath138 setup .",
    "[ fig : glass_qa ] ]",
    "we introduced a novel qmc algorithm to perform sqa with a transverse ferromagnetic two - spin driver hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ e : hq ] ) .",
    "this type of fluctuation extends the standard tf - sqa , adding also a two - body transverse operator of the form @xmath147 .",
    "though this possibility has been introduced already some years ago@xcite , it has never been used before with qmc simulations , and therefore never applied so far on large optimization problems .",
    "we notice that , since qmc techniques are limited by the so - called _ sign problem _ , we can simulate only the ferromagnetic version of two body transverse interaction .",
    "our discrete - time path - integral monte carlo algorithm is an extension of the well established _ _ loop algorithm__@xcite , with the inclusion of the transverse field operator , and implements restricted cluster updates to simulate efficiently large disordered systems .",
    "a first application to quantum annealing , on a random square lattice , reveals that the new driver hamiltonian improves upon the usual transverse field , though more systematic studies are required to address conclusively this question",
    ". indeed it will be interesting to optimize the interplay of the two parameters @xmath151 and @xmath152 along the annealing schedule and to perform a size scaling analysis .",
    "morover it will be important to find other classes of problem hamiltonians which can benefit more from this technique .",
    "we notice that the range of applicability of the present algorithm can go beyond sqa , since it would be also possible to explore phase diagrams of xyz sign - problem free hamiltonians with transverse field , defined on arbitrary lattices , by performing equilibrium simulations with a converged number of trotter time steps .",
