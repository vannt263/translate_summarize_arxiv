    "qcd physicists are now starting to include the determinant in their calculations .",

    "such results as they become available will serve as benchmarks for determinant algorithms , including the various lattice discretizations of the dirac operator in use , and hence a means of reliably estimating computational error , a major problem in lattice qcd at present .",
