    "this rare - earth ( re ) aluminate has also demonstrated very good performance in the microwave range , with a relative permittivity value of order 16 and low loss@xcite , which are valuable for the design of dielectric resonators . also , due its high heat conductivity , it has found use as a substrate material for thin films of high temperature superconductors with a wide range for microwave component applications , such as use in microstrip lines @xcite .",
    "recently , experimentalists have shown that re electron spin defects in yap have great potential for the development of crucial components for quantum computers and quantum communication devices @xcite .",
    "in fact , strong coupling has been demonstrated in circuit qed experiments using erbium doped yap , er@xmath1:yalo@xmath2@xcite at microwave frequencies , with the aim to implement quantum memories using hybrid architecture . however , the microwave properties of yap are not well characterized and such experiments would greatly benefit from a rigorous characterization of the material properties , especially at dilution fridge temperatures .",
    "the cavity - resonator method has been implemented previously@xcite to measure the relative permittivity and dielectric losses of yap .",
    "this work presented a single permittivity component at a frequency of 7.767 ghz equal to 16 at room temperature .",
    "this determined value decreased no more than 4% when the crystal was cooled down to 20 k. however , yap is a biaxial crystal with orthorhombic symmetry ; which means it has a diagonal permittivity tensor with three distinct elements as in eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] @xcite .",
    "therefore , full determination of its permittivity tensor components is desirable and will allow more accurate design in applications using this material .",
    "@xmath3    for those reasons , this work presents for the first time a thorough characterization of real permittivity tensor of yap using the split - post dielectric resonator ( spdr ) and whispering gallery mode ( wgm ) techniques .",
    "temperature dependence of the tensor components and the crystal losses down to 20 mk were also investigated and temperature coefficients of permittivity ( tcp ) were calculated . following this we performed spectroscopy of impurity ions in the sample using the wgm technique @xcite at 20 mk .",
    "new impurity ion transitions were measured with zero - field splittings of 16.72 and 9.92 ghz .",

    "the wgm method uses a cylindrical bulk sample placed within a cylindrical metallic cavity .",
    "multiple electromagnetic modes are then excited within the dielectrically loaded cavity , with the wgms families are selected to perform the permittivity characterization .    a cylindrical yap sample of @xmath11 mm height and diameter equal to @xmath12 mm made by scientific materials corporation was used .",
    "it had a concentric hole @xmath13 mm diameter parallel to its longitudinal axis , also parallel to the crystal crystalographic a - axis .",
    "the sample was placed into a copper cavity and supported by a teflon holder to position it at near the center of the cavity ( cavity design in detail in @xcite ) .",
    "two electromagnetic probes were inserted into the cavity and connected to the input / output signal of a vector network analyzer ( vna ) operating in transmission mode .",

    "typically the real part of permittivity of dielectric crystals have negligible frequency dependence @xcite .",

    "these results are consistent with the results published by @xcite and show no significant variation below 40 k. under 1 k , small frequency shifts with temperature are observed , which are below the precision of the permittivity determination . this effect has been well documented in cryogenic sapphire resonators and was shown to be due to residual paramagnetic impurity defects within the crystal lattice @xcite . this outcome has been used to annul the temperature coefficient of frequency ( tcf ) of high - q microwave wgms , by operating at the temperature where the temperature coefficient of magnetic susceptibility of the impurity ion cancels the shift due to the tcp @xcite .",
    "this is essential for the realization of the ultra stable cryogenic sapphire oscillator , which attains exquisite frequency stability of order parts in @xmath17 @xcite .",

    "[ fig3 ] presents how the crystal losses change in cryogenic temperatures .",
    "the q - factor of the resonance modes was measured at the same temperatures the permittivity components were probed .",

    "the tcp was also calculated and in fig .",
    "the yap coefficients are compared to other two other widely used single crystals .",
    "the data points are only presented for temperatures above 30 k , away from effects due to residual paramagnetic impurities .",
    "an immediate analysis shows that yap has a stronger temperature dependence of permittivity than sapphire , however sapphire is not a good host for re elements @xcite , which is an undesirable feature for several applications . comparing to the yttrium orthosilicate ( yso )",
    ", yap s tcp does not have significant difference , but still has the advantage of having relatively lower magnetic anisotropy , which make it more suitable for operation in superconducting cavities and circuits @xcite .",
    "the evidence of paramagnetic impurity defects was originally observable from the frequency temperature dependence of the microwave modes at low temperature .",
    "thus , due to the potential of the yap crystal for microwave and optical quantum information applications , we performed electron spin resonance ( esr ) spectroscopy close the lowest temperature of our measurements , where spins in the lattice may be coupled strongly with photons and manipulated with qubits @xcite . moreover , recently iron group impurity ion spin states were discovered in single crystal yso with strong coupling to whispering gallery photons@xcite , and in this work we confirm similar spin ensembles in yap .",

    "transmission measurements identified several wgms generated in the crystal between 6 and 20 ghz and at 20 mk in temperature .",
    "these modes were then monitored in a narrow frequency span and at low input power while the magnet performed a sweep from 0 to 0.1 t.    the data collected from the vna showed the signatures of several interactions between spin states and photonic modes as indicated by avoided level crossings ( alcs ) , i.e. , the normal mode splitting resultant from the hybridization of two harmonic oscillators .",
    "[ fig5 ] presents a map where the relevant alcs are represented by dots and are connected by lines to emphasize the zeeman effect .",

    "[ fig6 ] a similar prominent alc is recognised , due to the transition between @xmath27 spin states , surrounded by eight hf transitions .",
    "in contrast , the transitions associated with the a and b alcs have never before been identified , and are thus of potential interest for application in hybrid quantum architectures .    to determine the properties of the 15.18 ghz wgm interacting with",
    "the measured spins ensembles , the alcs were fitted using a two - mode coupled harmonic oscillators model .",
    "this model assumes two representative lcr oscillators ( labeled with subscripts 1 and 2 ) coupled reactively through the magnetic field ( mutual inductance ) with a dimensionless coupling coefficient of @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the calculated characteristic equation for the coupled mode system is written in eqn .",
    "[ eq2 ] , ignoring all terms of order @xmath29 .",
    "this is a very good approximation for any system of relatively high q - factor ( i.e. above 10 ) .",
    "@xmath30    to solve for the normal mode frequencies , and hence coupling between the normal modes , all q - values were set to infinity and the normal mode frequencies , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , were solved for by setting the characteristic equation to zero .",
    "the only unknown to determine was the coupling strengths , which in hz is given by @xmath33 , and was determined by fitting the experimental data ( assigning subscript 1 to the wgm and subscript 2 to the spin ensemble ) .",
    "results of the fits for the tree photon - spin interactions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ( a)-(c ) , with the numeric values of @xmath34 listed in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "the hybridized spin - photon system clearly shows a coupling greater than the wgm photon linewidth .",
    "however due to the losses introduced by the spin ensembles in the interaction , it was difficult to estimate the spin linewidth ( or effective spin q - factor ) as the cavity coupling was reduced to below the sensitivity of our experiment , and it could not be determined if we were in the strong coupling regime .",
    "thus , to solve for the spin linewidths ( or effective spin q - factor ) we used a similar technique as developed in reference @xcite for a coupled n - mode system of mechanical oscillators . to do this we write the characteristic equation for the normal mode system as",
    "; @xmath35 then we equate odd powers of @xmath36 between eqn .",
    "[ eq2 ] and eqn .",
    "[ eq3 ] ( note , equating even coefficients verifies the same normal mode frequencies as already determined ) .",
    "subsequently the following matrix equation may be derived to solve for normal mode q - factors .",
    "@xmath37    the photonic q - factor , @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) was easily measured at zero field and by measuring the normal mode q - factors during the mode hybridization , the effective q - factor of the spin ensemble , @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) , may be estimated by fitting the data to the matrix equation above ( given by eqn .",
    "[ eq4 ] ) .",
    "the data along with the fitting curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ( a)-(f ) and the extracted parameters shown in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "although the coupling strengths of the three interactions exceed the photonic half linewidths ( @xmath42 ) , the spins half linewidths ( @xmath43 ) surpassed the couplings by a factor of three , which means the spins transitions losses prevented the strong coupling regime ( @xmath44 ) to be reached .",
    "the collective coupling strength , nevertheless , is related to the spins concentration , @xmath45 , by @xmath46 @xcite , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the frequency of the wgm and the sample transverse magnetic filling factor , respectively . for the 15.18 ghz resonance , @xmath48 is about 84% , corresponding to the simulated @xmath49 mode structure .",
    "thus the estimated average spin concentration is on the order of 10@xmath50 @xmath51 and increasing the concentration of impurities in the crystal by intentional doping would allow strong coupling between the photonic mode and the spins ensembles .",
    "in conclusion , this work presented an investigation of the yap microwave properties . in the first part",
    ", a precise measurement of the three non - zero components of the yap real permittivity tensor was performed and the values of @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 were obtained with the sample at 20 mk .",
    "mode frequencies predicted from the found permittivity tensor differ on average by only 10 mhz from the measured data , with the uncertainties mainly due the imprecision in the determination of the sample s dimensions .",
    "the crystal losses were also assessed through the measurement of the q - factors of four photonic modes and a study of the temperature dependence of these properties were performed between room and sub - kelvin temperatures , including the measurement of the temperature coefficient of permittivity . in the second part , esr spectroscopy of the same sample was performed at 20 mk and allowed the identification of two new electronic spin impurity transitions with zero - field splitting at 16.72 and 9.92 ghz and spin - photon couplings strengths of @xmath55 and @xmath56 mhz , respectively , exceeding the wgm linewidth of 116 khz .",
