    "neutron stars offer the possibility to study matter under extreme conditions ( in density and neutron - to - proton ratio ) inaccessible to laboratory experiments on earth .",
    "the inner core of a neutron star may reach densities as high as five to ten times nuclear saturation density , a regime for which no well - converged theoretical expansions are presently available .",
    "the structure and composition of the inner core is consequently highly uncertain and may contain deconfined quark matter  @xcite , hyperonic matter  @xcite , or meson condensates  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the inner crust and outer core span densities from @xmath0g/@xmath1 , corresponding to nucleon fermi momenta of @xmath2mev , which is much less than the chiral symmetry breaking scale of @xmath3gev .",
    "chiral effective field theory ( eft ) @xcite may therefore provide a suitable theoretical framework for exploring neutron star matter at these densities .    in recent years",
    "there has been significant progress in the development of realistic chiral nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) forces @xcite at and beyond next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order ( n3lo ) in the chiral power counting .",
    "nuclear many - body forces become relevant in homogeneous matter at densities larger than @xmath4 ( where @xmath5g/@xmath1 is the saturation density of nuclear matter ) and have been included in numerous studies of the cold nuclear and neutron matter equations of state ( eos ) @xcite . neutron star structure and evolution",
    "requires in addition the equation of state at arbitrary isospin - asymmetry @xcite and finite temperature @xcite , which has been computed consistently with the same chiral nuclear force models and many - body methods .",
    "the inhomogeneous phase of nuclear matter encountered in neutron star crusts depends also on gradient contributions to the energy density .",
    "previous work has focused on the leading - order hartree - fock contribution to the isoscalar and isovector gradient couplings from the density matrix expansion @xcite , ab initio studies of the isovector gradient coupling strength from quantum monte carlo simulations of pure neutron matter @xcite , and nuclear response functions in fermi liquid theory @xcite .",
    "neutron star crusts have been studied using phenomenological liquid drop models  @xcite and the thomas - fermi approximation  @xcite .",
    "nuclear pasta phases resulting from the competition between the coulomb interaction and nuclear surface tension were also treated in the liquid drop and thomas - fermi methods .",
    "more sophisticated approaches to the nuclear pasta phase have been investigated using the skyrme - hartree fock approximation  @xcite and molecular dynamic simulations  @xcite .    in the present work we utilize recent results for the homogeneous nuclear matter equation of state from chiral eft to develop new skyrme mean field parametrizations that enable the study of finite nuclei , inhomogeneous nuclear matter in neutron star crusts , and the mass - radius relation of neutron stars .",
    "recent works @xcite have used the low - density equation of state of neutron matter from chiral eft to constrain nonrelativistic and relativistic mean field models , while the present study includes the full isospin - asymmetric matter equation of state at second order in perturbation theory up to @xmath6 as a fitting constraint .",
    "several chiral nuclear force models are considered in order to estimate the theoretical uncertainty .",
    "we find that the traditional skyrme model can not accommodate the density dependence of the nuclear equations of state derived from chiral effective field theory .",
    "we therefore introduce additional interaction terms in the skyrme hamiltonian that go as the next higher power of the fermi momentum .",
    "this enables an accurate reproduction of the bulk - matter equation of state from chiral eft . using the new models",
    ", we investigate the phase of sub - saturation nuclear matter , which is expected to be present at the boundary between the outer core and inner crust of neutron stars , an environment that is highly neutron rich .",
    "indeed the proton fraction of nuclear matter in beta equilibrium at the crust - core boundary is roughly @xmath7 . in the boundary region ,",
    "nuclear matter experiences a shape change caused by the competition between the repulsive coulomb interaction and surface tension .",
    "we adopt the analytic solution of the coulomb interaction in discrete dimensions to study the phase of nuclear matter in the liquid drop model ( ldm ) formalism .",
    "the energy per nucleon of nuclear matter determines the lowest energy state and therefore the discrete shape in the pasta phase .",
    "we also study inhomogeneous nuclear matter by employing the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation employing a parameterized density profile ( pdp ) for neutrons and protons .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we describe the skyrme force model used to investigate the neutron star inner crust and outer core .",
    "the traditional skyrme model is extended in order to reproduce the homogeneous matter equation of state of isospin - asymmetric nuclear matter from chiral effective field theory as well as the ground state energies of doubly magic nuclei . in section [ sec :",
    "boundary ] , we present the numerical method to determine the transition density for the core - crust boundary . the liquid drop model , thomas - fermi approximation , and thermodynamic instability methods are then employed to find the transition densities .",
    "we summarize our results in section [ sec : con ] .",
    "we begin by describing the microscopic chiral nuclear force models @xcite employed in the present study .",
    "the two - body force is treated at n3lo in the chiral expansion , and the 24 low - energy constants associated with nn contact terms are fitted to elastic nucleon - nucleon scattering phase shifts and deuteron properties .",
    "the three - body force is treated at n2lo , and the @xmath8 and @xmath9 low - energy constants associated with the contact three - body force and one - pion exchange three - body force , respectively , are fitted to reproduce the ground - state energies of @xmath10h and @xmath10he as well as the beta - decay lifetime of @xmath10h .",
    "the resolution scale is set by the momentum - space cutoff @xmath11 , which is varied over the range @xmath12mev . at this resolution scale many - body perturbation theory",
    "is well converged , and the resulting neutron matter equation of state below saturation density is strongly constrained @xcite .",
    "cutoff variation provides only one means to study the theoretical uncertainties in chiral effective field theory , and future work will be devoted understanding better the errors due to neglected higher - order terms in the chiral expansion .",
    "to be specific we use three different values of the momentum - space cutoff @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15  mev and denote the corresponding nuclear potentials as n3lo414 , n3lo450 , and n3lo500 .",
    "the strategy is then to identify what approximations are needed in each case to provide an accurate description of the bulk matter equation of state in the vicinity of nuclear matter saturation . as shown in previous work",
    "@xcite , the chiral potentials with the two lowest cutoff values give reasonable nuclear matter properties at second - order in many - body perturbation theory with hartree - fock intermediate - state propagators . in particular , the saturation energy lies in the range @xmath16mev while the saturation density lies in the range @xmath17@xmath18 . at the same approximation in many - body perturbation theory ,",
    "the @xmath19mev chiral potential exhibits too little attraction , and the binding energy per nucleon at saturation density is only @xmath20mev .",
    "we therefore employ for this potential second - order perturbation theory with free - particle intermediate - state energies , which on the one hand accounts for theory uncertainties associated with the choice of the single - particle energy spectrum and on the other hand leads to an improved description of nuclear matter saturation .",
    "the latter results from a larger density of states near the fermi surface that enhances the overall attraction from the second - order perturbative contribution . in this case the saturation energy and density are @xmath21mev and @xmath22@xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the calculations outlined above have been extended in the present work to describe cold nuclear matter at arbitrary isospin asymmetry .",
    "the resulting equations of state are then used as data in fitting new skyrme model parametrizations .",
    "in addition , the density - gradient contributions to the nuclear energy density , which have important effects on the structure of the neutron star inner crust , are constrained by including the ground - state energies of doubly - magic nuclei in the @xmath23 minimization function for the skyrme model parameters .",
    "the same two- and three - body chiral potentials have also been used in numerous studies of nuclear dynamics and thermodynamics ( for recent reviews , see refs.@xcite . in particular , the critical endpoint of the first - order liquid - gas phase transition line was found @xcite to be consistent with recent empirical determinations @xcite , and the low - density  high - temperature equation of state of pure neutron matter was found @xcite to be in very good agreement with the model - independent virial expansion .",
    "the applications described below focus on the cold neutron star composition and equation of state , but we may anticipate future extensions to finite temperature matter employing a strategy similar to that described above .",
    "the energy density in dense nuclear matter can be expanded in powers of the proton and neutron fermi momenta , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , as follows @xmath26n^{\\gamma } \\",
    ", , \\end{aligned } \\label{eq : pol}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "the above approximation can explain @xmath30eft asymmetric matter results quite well with small deviation ( @xmath31 ) , at least for @xmath32  mev .",
    "however , it can not be used to calculate the properties of finite nuclei directly unless we find the surface tension in the liquid drop model or the gradient terms in the thomas - fermi approximation    the polynomial expansion in eq .",
    "can be derived from the phenomenological skyrme nucleon - nucleon interaction , given by @xmath33 \\\\ & + t_2(1 + x_2{p_\\mathbf{\\sigma}}){\\mathbf{k}^{\\prime}}\\cdot \\delta ( { \\mathbf{r}_i -\\mathbf{r}_j}){\\mathbf{k}}\\\\ & + \\frac{1}{6}t_3(1+x_3{p_\\mathbf{\\sigma}})\\rho^{\\alpha}\\delta({\\mathbf{r}_i -\\mathbf{r}_j } ) \\\\ & + iw_0 { \\mathbf{k}^{\\prime}}\\delta({\\mathbf{r}_i -\\mathbf{r}_j})\\times { \\mathbf{k}}\\cdot ( { \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}_i+{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}_j ) \\ , , \\end{aligned } \\label{eq : skyint}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the spin exchange operator , the local density @xmath35 is evaluated at @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 . +    .skyrme force parameters fitted to the chiral n3lo asymmetric matter equation of state and finite nuclei binding energies .",
    "the parameters have units such that the energy density is given in mev @xmath18 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have studied the composition and structure of neutron star crusts by comparing the energy densities for different pasta phases using both the liquid drop model and the thomas - fermi model .",
    "the results are based on a new set of extended skyrme parametrizations derived in the present work that fit the bulk isospin - asymmetric nuclear matter equation of state from @xmath30eft and the binding energies of doubly - magic nuclei .",
    "the neutron star maximum masses obtained from these skyrme parametrizations are consistent with observations of @xmath39 neutron stars .    from the ldm and tf calculations",
    ", the crust - core transition density is strongly correlated with the saturation density of symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "for this reason the extended skyrme parametrization sk@xmath30450 , which reproduces well both the empirical saturation energy and density , is expected to provide the most reliable prediction for the crust - core interface density .",
    "the predicted pressure at the phase boundaries between different pasta geometries is smooth in the ldm but exhibits small discontinuities in the tf approximation .",
    "we have studied as well a continuous - dimension ldm that treats the pasta phases as a function of the dense matter volume fraction in the wigner - seitz cell .",
    "all three methods give a core - crust boundary density around half saturation density , @xmath40@xmath18 .    compared to previous works @xcite",
    ", we analyzed the theoretical uncertainties in the core transition density of neutron stars by varying the gradient terms @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we find that the transition density has a two - dimensional correlation with the @xmath43 s .",
    "low values of these gradient term coupling strengths result in an increase in the transition density from the crust to core , which increases the volume of the neutron star crust .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be reduced by microscopic calculations of the static density response function using @xmath30eft in many - body perturbation theory or quantum monte carlo simulations .",
    "a more accurate determination of @xmath41 and @xmath42 will therefore play an important role for improving energy density functionals and to more accurately predict the density at a neutron star s core - crust boundary .",
    "we find that nuclear pasta exists within the density range between @xmath44  @xmath18 and @xmath45  @xmath18 .",
    "macroscopically it exists within a 100  m thickness in the inner crust of a neutron star with 1.4@xmath46 .",
    "the spherical hole phase exists within the density range of @xmath47  @xmath18 at most .",
    "this means that spherical holes exist only within a @xmath48  m range in neutron stars , which might be destroyed in fast rotating neutron stars because of tidal deformation .",
    "our results are similar to the previous works of oyamatsu  @xcite and sharma et al .",
