    "dilepton distributions have been proposed as one of the penetrating probes for hot and dense nuclear matter created in high - energy nuclear collisions . due to their relatively small cross - sections with the hot / dense environment ,",
    "dileptons bring us direct information of the created matter in such collisions .",
    "since dileptons are created over all stages of heavy ion reactions , their sources vary as a function of kinematics . in the low mass region ( lmr : @xmath1 1.1 gev/@xmath2 ) , vector meson in - medium properties and directed photons can be studied through their di - leptonic decays , while in the intermediate mass region ( imr : 1.1 @xmath3 3 gev/@xmath2 ) quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) radiation is expected to have a signification contribution at rhic . in the high mass region ( hmr :",
    "@xmath4 3 gev/@xmath2 ) , dileptons are mostly from heavy ( charm and bottom ) quark decays and drell - yan processes . as a result , the dilepton distributions , especially in the imr and hmr , could provide new insights of early collision dynamics in heavy ion collisions .    with the completion of the full barrel time - of - flight detector@xcite",
    ", the electron identification has been significantly improved at star , especially in low momentum region . in this paper",
    "we will present the first star results on dielectron production in p + p and au + au collisions at @xmath5 = 200 gev .",
    "the results are obtained from 200 gev p + p and au+au collisions , taken in year 2009 and 2010 , respectively .",
    "the main subsystems of the star detector@xcite used for this analysis are the time projection chamber ( tpc ) and the time - of - flight detector ( tof ) with 2@xmath6 azimuthal coverage at mid - rapidity .",
    "in addition to track detection and momentum determination capabilities , the tpc provides particle identification for charged particles by measuring their ionization energy loss ( @xmath7 ) in the tpc gas@xcite .",
    "the newly installed full barrel tof detector provides the particle velocity ( @xmath8 ) information@xcite . in this analysis",
    "we combine tpc @xmath7 and tof @xmath8 information to identify electrons . the electron purity in p + p analysis is @xmath9 , and @xmath10 in minimum - bias au + au analysis .",
    "the background reconstruction in this analysis is based on the mixed - event technique and the like - sign method .",
    "the invariant mass distribution from event mixing agrees with the same - event unlike - sign distribution in the imr and hmr as shown in fig.[background](left ) , and the right plot shows the ratio of the like - sign and mixed - event background . in the lmr , due to the correlated background , from _",
    "e.g. _ cross pair and jet contribution@xcite , we subtract the like - sign background with an acceptance correction .",
    "the acceptance correction is needed because the acceptance of like sign pairs is slightly different to that of unlike sign pairs . in the imr",
    ", we use the mixed - event background@xcite since it offers better statistics .",
    "the systematic error in the lmr is dominated by the acceptance uncertainty ( @xmath11 ) . in the imr and hmr ,",
    "it is dominated by the normalization factor uncertainty from different normalization methods and the normalization region ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the dielecton continuum results in this paper are within star acceptance ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) and corrected for efficiency .",

    "p and au + au collisions are shown in fig.[slope](left ) .",
    "the spectra in au+au collisions is consistent with the tsallis blave - wave model prediction based on the fit to other hadrons @xcite . in p+p collisions ,",
    "the spectra is consistent with the previous measurements @xcite and tsallis fit to high @xmath15 @xmath19 spectra @xcite .    in the imr ,",
    "compared to minimum - bias collisions , the yield from binary - scaled charm contributions from pythia over - predicts the data in central collisions , which could indicate the modification of charm production in central au + au collisions . as show in fig.[slope](right ) , the transverse mass slope parameters in p + p collisions are consistent with the pythia charm , but they are different for the au + au results , as the slope parameters in au + au collisions are higher than those in p + p collisions .",
