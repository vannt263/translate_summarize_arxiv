    "cork twist_. the operation of removing a compact , contractible , smooth submanifold @xmath0 from a closed 4-manifold @xmath1 , and regluing it by an involution @xmath2 of @xmath3 , can change the diffeomorphism type of @xmath1 ( but not its homeomorphism type ) .",
    "the first example of this phenomenon was published by akbulut @xcite in 1991 .",
    "a few years later , various authors @xcite , @xcite showed that any two homeomorphic , simply connected ( smooth ) 4-manifolds are related by a cork twist .",
    "( see @xcite , @xcite for more history ) .",
    "the question was immediately raised of whether higher order corks may exist  and in particular , whether there was such a pair @xmath4 and an infinite order diffeomorphism @xmath2 of @xmath3 such that the @xmath5-indexed family of homeomorphic manifolds obtained by regluing using all powers of @xmath2 were pairwise nondiffeomorphic . in weaker form , can there even be a contractible 4-manifold @xmath0 with a boundary diffeomorphism for which no nonzero power extends to a self - diffeomorphism of @xmath0 ?",
    "no progress was made on these questions until recently . in 2014 , akbulut posted a paper @xcite claiming an example affirmatively answering the latter question using handle calculus .",
    "however , the paper was quickly retracted due to errors in the proof . in 2016",
    "@xcite , the author of the present paper constructed an infinite family of examples @xmath6 , each one affirmatively answering the stronger question , using an entirely different plan of attack and no handle diagrams .",
    "this raised the question of how the paper translates into the language of these diagrams .",
    "section  [ notes ] of the present paper gives the result , in a form independent of , but clearly derived from , @xcite .",
    "armed with the author s preliminary notes on this , akbulut further examined the simplest case @xmath7 ( see the main theorem of @xcite ) .",
    "a possible motivation for such an analysis is that the cork twists on each 3-manifold @xmath8 ( and in akbulut s 2014 posting ) were twists on incompressible tori , and he recast these diagrammatically as  @xmath9-moves \" .",
    "such moves depend on a choice of auxiliary band , and so appear to provide additional generality .",
    "we show in section  [ twist ] , however , that @xmath9-moves are essentially equivalent to torus twists under broad hypotheses .",
    "since incompressible tori are tightly constrained in 3-manifolds , @xmath9-moves are harder to find than they initially seem to be , and might be most easily located using the well - developed theory of incompressible tori ( as akbulut implicitly did in using the material of our section  [ notes ] to locate his @xmath9-move in @xcite ) .",
    "we also find conditions under which such diffeomorphisms necessarily extend over a given 4-manifold , partially answering a question from @xcite and shedding light on akbulut s 2014 posting .",
    "it is hoped that the constraints on @xmath9-moves and nontrivial torus twists presented in this paper will help guide cork aficionados in the most fruitful directions .",
    "we begin by considering torus twists , @xmath9-moves and the relation between these ( section  [ twist ] ) .",
    "akbulut defined @xmath9-moves diagrammatically , primarily through a single example . to make progress",
    ", we must more carefully define @xmath9-moves and explore some nontrivial foundational questions . in general , it is not clear whether a given diagram for a @xmath9-move ( for a fixed auxiliary band and assuming akbulut s unknottedness hypothesis ) always specifies a diffeomorphism , and when it does , it need not be unique . fortunately",
    ", the only 3-manifolds that arise in the relevant articles @xcite , @xcite and @xcite are irreducible and not @xmath10 . in that case , we prove that every @xmath9-move diagram uniquely determines a diffeomorphism , and this is given by a torus or klein bottle twist ( theorems  [ unique ] and [ equivalent ] ) . if the manifold is also a homology sphere , as is necessary for cork boundaries , @xmath9-moves and torus twists are equivalent ( corollary  [ hsphere ] ) . for arbitrary 3-manifolds , these same theorems",
    "specify the additional data needed to uniquely obtain a diffeomorphism , and show that under broad hypotheses these data can be chosen so that a diffeomorphism exists and is given by a torus or klein bottle twist .",
    "since it is awkward to specify the additional data via diagrams , this seems to be the appropriate level for dealing with @xmath9-moves .",
    "we also observe technical difficulties that need to be addressed whenever @xmath9-moves ( or torus twists ) are used for diagrammatically cutting and pasting 4-manifolds .",
    "continuing with 4-manifold applications in section  [ fishtail ] , we find a useful method to guarantee that cutting and regluing by a torus twist or @xmath9-move does not change the diffeomorphism type of a 4-manifold .",
    "this allows us to partially answer a question from @xcite : the nontrivial cork twists of that paper were parallel to the longitude of an incompressible torus in @xmath8 .",
    "it was asked whether twisting parallel to the meridian was also nontrivial .",
    "we show that the answer is no for each of the manifolds @xmath11 .",
    "thus , while the potential twists are indexed by @xmath12 , only one @xmath5-summand is useful for producing exotic 4-manifolds .",
    "the question remains open for @xmath13 , but we also see that for the specific embedding @xmath6 used in @xcite , only one @xmath5-summand ( the longitude ) affects the resulting diffeomorphism type .",
    "thus , a nontriviality proof for meridian twisting would at least require a different setup .",
    "this method also sheds light on akbulut s 2014 posting .",
    "a preliminary version of that posting was based on a contractible manifold of the general form subsequently considered in @xcite , namely @xmath14 .",
    "it was argued ( private communication ) that while the proof was erroneous , the example itself might still be an infinite order cork , and in particular , careful choice of the band for the @xmath9-move might yield a proof .",
    "however , the cork twist in question was a meridian twist .",
    "our method shows that such a @xmath9-move necessarily extends over the 4-manifold , regardless of choice of band ( which is the only thing to choose , once the direction of the twist is specified ) .",
    "the main lesson from this example for cork researchers seems to be that nontrivial @xmath9-moves are difficult to find by hand , and it should be helpful to first understand the incompressible tori of the underlying 3-manifold . since this example @xmath14 does not fit into the family @xmath15 for which @xcite applies , it is still an open question whether a longitudinal twist extends over this contractible 4-manifold .",
    "the corresponding manifold in the final version of the posting has a more complicated form that will not be considered further in this paper .",
    "nothing appears to be currently known about extending its boundary diffeomorphisms .",
    "section  [ notes ] is essentially independent of the previous material and gives a translation of the proofs in @xcite into handle calculus . in this form ,",
    "the proof is necessarily more difficult ( compared with the 2-paragraph existence proof in @xcite ) , but provides a clear view of the pieces and how they fit together .",
    "this proof is independent of @xcite , but fundamentally the same .",
    "we sketch the correspondence as we go along .",
    "we exhibit a cork @xmath0 by a diagram ( figure  [ c ] ) constructed from the existence proof of @xcite , and show it is diffeomorphic to @xmath16 as exhibited by figure  [ crsm ]",
    ". then we embed @xmath0 in a family of larger manifolds @xmath17 , related ( as @xmath18 varies in @xmath5 , with the other variables fixed ) by powers of a twist on an incompressible torus in @xmath3 .",
    "( see figure  [ z ] .",
    "the @xmath19 versions of some of these diagrams can also be seen in @xcite , with a sketch of a similar proof .",
    "for example , @xmath20 in akbulut s figure  6 is identical to our @xmath21 . )",
    "finally , we show that these manifolds embed in a family of closed manifolds @xmath22 related by the same cork twists , and distinguish these using the same method as @xcite : we show that they are obtained by the fintushel - stern knot construction on elliptic surfaces .",
    "this has the advantage that the manifolds are well known not to be diffeomorphic @xcite , @xcite , bypassing the difficulty of analyzing seiberg - witten functions ( although a recent result of sunukjian @xcite makes the latter approach practical . )",
    "some authors require corks to be stein domains by definition .",
    "this seems to be an entirely separate issue from that of changing diffeomorphism types by twisting , although akbulut and matveyev @xcite showed that corks , in the original sense where @xmath2 is an involution , can always be modified to admit stein structures .",
    "the author has made no attempt to address the stein condition in this paper or its predecessor .",
    "it remains an interesting question whether any of these corks are ( or can be modified to be ) stein domains .",
    "we work in the smooth category throughout the paper . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume ( unless otherwise indicated ) that all 3-manifolds are orientable and closed , and all 4-manifolds are orientable and compact ( allowing boundary ) .",
    "we begin by carefully defining the diffeomorphisms we wish to study .",
    "let @xmath23 be a torus embedded in a 3-manifold .",
    "identify a tubular neighborhood of @xmath24 with @xmath25 , and let @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , for some @xmath30 .    the _ torus twist _ on @xmath24 parallel to @xmath26",
    "is the diffeomorphism @xmath31 obtained from @xmath32 by extending as the identity on the rest of @xmath33 and smoothing .",
    "informally , we cross a dehn twist on the annulus @xmath34 with the identity on @xmath27 .",
    "this is a well - known , classical diffeomorphism of @xmath33 .",
    "since @xmath24 is contained , by lie group multiplication , in the group @xmath35 of orientation - preserving self - diffeomorphisms of @xmath24 , inducing an isomorphism @xmath36 , we obtain a homomorphism @xmath37 with primitive elements sent to torus twists parallel to the corresponding circles of @xmath24 . for most irreducible 3-manifolds",
    "@xmath33 , these twists , ranging over all incompressible tori , are known to generate the group @xmath38 up to a finite extension .",
    "( see the last corollary of @xcite . )",
    "when @xmath24 is compressible and @xmath33 is irreducible , @xmath24 either lies in a ball or bounds a solid torus over which the action of @xmath24 extends , so all twists on @xmath24 are isotopic to the identity .",
    "irreducibility is necessary here : for a connected sum , we expect nontrivial slide diffeomorphisms constructed by dragging the site of the sum around a loop @xmath39 in one summand .",
    "such a diffeomorphism can be described as a twist about the compressible torus bounding a tubular neighborhood of @xmath39 .",
    "we can similarly define twists on spheres and klein bottles , but former have order at most 2 in @xmath38 ( since @xmath40 ) .",
    "if @xmath41 is an embedded klein bottle , we identify @xmath42 as a bundle over a circle @xmath27 with fiber @xmath26 .",
    "the previous description can still be applied over intervals in @xmath27 , since the monodromy around @xmath27 reverses orientations of both @xmath26 and @xmath43 ( by orientability of @xmath33 ) , hence , commutes with the dehn twist .",
    "a tubular neighborhood of @xmath42 is bounded by a torus @xmath24 double covering @xmath42 .",
    "note that @xmath24 is incompressible if and only if @xmath42 is , since any compressing disk for @xmath42 must be bounded by an orientation - preserving loop in @xmath42 .",
    "it is easy to see that the square @xmath44 of a twist @xmath2 on @xmath42 is a twist on @xmath24 parallel to the same circle @xmath26 .",
    "klein bottle twists seem less useful than torus twists , since they only arise when the jsj - decomposition of @xmath33 includes the @xmath43-bundle over the klein bottle with orientable total space .",
    "in particular , this does not occur for homology spheres , so there can be no klein bottle cork twists .",
    "we define @xmath9-moves following akbulut @xcite , with additional attention to detail in anticipation of the upcoming proofs .",
    "first , consider the standard 3-manifold diffeomorphism given by figure  [ 1h ] , which can be obtained by blowing up a @xmath45-framed unknot around one twist box , sliding this unknot over the 0-framed circle so that it surrounds the other twist box , then blowing back down . for a @xmath9-move , start with a framed circle @xmath0 in a 3-manifold @xmath33 .",
    "we can always draw @xmath33 as surgery on a link @xmath46 in @xmath47 so that @xmath0 appears as a 0-framed unknot in @xmath48 , spanned by a disk @xmath49 .",
