    "the p - nuclei refer to stable , heavy nuclides that are neutron - deficient and can not , for that reason , be produced in stars by the slow or rapid neutron capture chains ( s- or r - processes ) , unlike the majority of heavy nuclei with charge number in excess of the value @xmath0 ( fe ) .",
    "thirty - five nuclei are classically considered as p - nuclei , with @xmath1 ranging from 34 ( se ) to 80 ( hg ) , although 5 of them can also be produced to some extend by the s - process .",
    "all p - nuclei can be synthesized from the destruction of pre - existing seed nuclei of the s- and r - type by a combination of ( p,@xmath2 )  captures and ( @xmath2,@xmath3 ) , ( @xmath2,@xmath4 )  or ( @xmath2,@xmath5)photoreactions . complemented by some @xmath6 , electron captures and ( n,@xmath2 )  reactions , those nuclear flows are referred to as the p - process . that p - nuclei are produced from existing s- or r - seed nuclei is comforted by the fact that in the solar system they represent only a small fraction ( 0.01 to 1% , exceptionally of the order of 10% ) , of the isotopic content of the corresponding elements .",
    "the ( p,@xmath2 )  reactions require both high temperatures and large proton densities and appear to contribute only and probably marginally , to the production of the lightest p - nuclei .",
    "photodisintegrations are thus expected to play the leading role in the p - process .",
    "temperatures in excess of about @xmath7 ( @xmath8 k , where t is the temperature in kelvin ) are required for photodisintegrations to take place on time scales comparable to stellar evolutionary ones , and may not exceed @xmath9 in order to avoid the photoerosion of all the heavy nuclei to the more stable nuclei of the  iron peak \" .",
    "it is also necessary to freeze - out the photodesintegrations on a short enough time - scale , typically of the order of one second .",
    "those constraints are nicely satisfied in the deep o - ne - rich layers of massive stars exploding as type ii supernovae ( sne - ii ) .",
    "the sn - ii is undoubtedly the most studied and the most satisfactory scenario for the p - process @xcite .",
    "other plausible sites for the p - process , like pre - supernova burning phases of massive stars or the explosion of type ia supernovae , have also been explored ( see @xcite for a very complete review of those works ) .    in order to estimate the number of photoreactions per unit of time in a given volume of a star at temperature @xmath10 , one has to integrate over the energy @xmath11 the cross section @xmath12 weighted by the photon energy distribution @xmath13 times the speed of light @xmath14 .",
    "as sect.[sec : basic ] will show more quantitatively , only the high energy tail of @xmath13 contributes to the rate , the integrand being non - negligible only on a relatively narrow window of photon energies .",
    "knowing @xmath13 , one might expect photodisintegration rates to be determined easily by the measurement of the cross section on that energy range , typically a few mev in the 110 mev domain ( sect .",
    "[ sec : basic ] ) .",
    "however , direct determinations of reaction rates for the p - process suffer from two major limitations .",
    "the first is the fact that the p - process involves thousands of photoreactions ( not to speak of the secondary nuclear transmutations mentioned above ) and that most of the involved nuclei are unstable , which means that only a tiny fraction of those reactions can be measured in the laboratory .",
    "the second limitation is that in a gas at high temperature , excited levels of the target nuclei are populated according to the boltzmann statistics , so that photoreactions on excited levels must be taken into account .",
    "this thermalization effect is specially important here because of the high temperatures involved in the p - process and because photodisintegrations are specially sensitive to threshold effects .",
    "this is illustrated in sect .",
    "[ sec : brems ] in the case of ( @xmath2,@xmath3)reactions .",
    "if the direct determination of astrophysical rates at work in the p - process is clearly out of reach , experimental studies of photodisintegration cross sections in the relevant energy range and for nuclei as close as possible to the neutron deficient side of the valley of stability are of crucial importance to test the nuclear reaction models used to calculate the rates .",
    "valuable pieces of information are also obtained , more traditionally , by the measurement of cross sections in the reverse , radiative capture channel .",
    "they can indeed be used to constrain the calculation of the rates in the photoreaction channel via the reciprocity theorem .",
    "one must keep in mind however that such measurements are but a fragment of the information needed for the calculation of the reverse rate . to be correct , such a calculation requires the knowledge of all non negligible cross sections from any excited state of the target nucleus to any state of the residual one .",
    "direct measurements of photodisintegration cross sections constitute therefore an independent set of data and the most straightforward way to constrain the calculation of the corresponding astrophysical rate .",
    "real - photon source facilities have been developed and the interest of some of these facilities for the study of the p - process is discussed in the present paper . after generalities on photon - induced reactions in sect .",
    "[ sec : basic ] , sect .",
    "[ sec : brems ] presents some results for ( @xmath2,@xmath3 )  reactions obtained at the bremsstrahlung facility of the technische universitt darmstadt .",
    "it is a nice feature of bremsstrahlung facilities that they can be tuned to produce photon spectra which approximate the high energy part of the planck spectrum for temperatures of interest for the p - process .",
    "the obtained experimental rate can be directly compared to the calculated rate for photoreaction on a ground - state nucleus .",
    "quasi - monochromatic photon beams with tunable energy can be obtained using the technique of laser inverse - compton scattering .",
    "this technique has been successfully applied recently to nuclear astrophysics at the national institute of advanced industrial science and technology in japan and is described in sect .",

    "section  [ sec : gamgam ] presents some results of ( @xmath15 ) experiments , providing direct insight into the @xmath2-strength below the particle threshold .",
    "all the experiments described in this paper shed new light on the low - energy tail of the @xmath2-ray strength in nuclei and are therefore expected to improve the rate predictions .    improving the theoretical predictions for photodisintegration rates will put p - process nucleosynthesis calculations on a firmer ground .",
    "as mentioned before the p - process takes place at very high temperatures but the nuclei involved are in a region of the nuclear chart where basic quantities like masses or @xmath16-decay rates are either known or rather reliably estimated .",

    "the photon density is governed by the exponential decrease in eq .",
    "[ eq : planck ] .    if eq .",
    "[ eq : planck ] is substituted for @xmath21 in eq .",
    "[ eq : rate ] , the rate becomes a function of the parameter @xmath10 .",
    "it is then possible to define the photon energy range which is the most relevant for determining @xmath27 at the temperatures of astrophysical interest .",
    "this results from the properties of the integrand of eq .",
    "[ eq : rate ] which differs significantly from zero only in a relatively small energy range .",
    "we call this range the gamow window by reference to the case of reactions induced by charged particles in a thermalized environment , where the entrance channel energy distribution is given by the maxwell - boltzmann statistics .",
    "here however one has to distinguish between ( @xmath2,@xmath3 )  reactions , where the position of the gamow window is determined by the reaction threshold , and ( @xmath2,@xmath4 )  or ( @xmath2,@xmath5 )  reactions where it is shifted and broadened by the coulomb barrier in the outgoing channel @xcite .",
    "the ( @xmath2,@xmath3 )  cross section close above the threshold @xmath28 can be expressed @xcite as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the angular momentum of the emitted neutron .",
    "[ eq : planck ] and [ eq : thres ] locate the maximum of the integrand in eq .",
    "[ eq : rate ] at @xmath31 for @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding narrow gamow window is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamow ] ( left panel ) for the temperatures @xmath33 and 3.0 .",
    "the gamow window for ( @xmath2,@xmath3 )  reactions thus remains close to the reaction threshold for all relevant temperatures . because of the strong temperature dependence of the photon density",
    ", the reaction rate depends sensitively on the temperature ; it increases by a factor @xmath34 from @xmath33 to 3.0 for the example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamow ] .    for the photon - induced emission of charged particles",
    "we make the assumption that the astrophysical @xmath35-factor is roughly constant for the inverse capture reaction .",
    "this leads to a gamow window for ( @xmath2,@xmath5 )  and ( @xmath2,@xmath4 )  reactions which peaks at the sum of the separation energy @xmath36 and the gamow window peak energy @xmath37 of the inverse capture reaction , @xmath38 and has the same width as the gamow window of the capture reaction .",
    "in contrast to the ( @xmath2,@xmath3 )  reaction , the position of the gamow window for ( @xmath2,@xmath5 )  and ( @xmath2,@xmath4 )  reactions changes significantly with temperature ( see right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : gamow ] ) .",
    "however , the temperature dependence of the reaction rate is less strong than in the ( @xmath2,@xmath3 )  case . from @xmath39 to 3 it changes by a factor of @xmath40 , i.e. three orders of magnitude less than in the neutron case .",
    "consequently , the branching ratio between ( @xmath2,@xmath3 )  and ( @xmath2,@xmath5 )  reactions will depend sensitively on the temperature .",
    "this remark , which applies also to some extend to the ( @xmath2,@xmath4 )  reactions , is of particular importance for the path followed by the nuclear flow in the p - process ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we remark also that in the nuclear mass region of interest for the p - process and not too far from stability , ( @xmath2,@xmath5 )  reactions usually have much larger reaction rates than ( @xmath2,@xmath4 )  reactions because in that region @xmath5 particles have small or even negative binding energies , whereas typical proton separation energies are of the order of several mev .",
    "therefore , when the @xmath5 particle is replaced by a proton , the smaller coulomb barrier , reducing @xmath37 in eq .",
    "[ eq : gamow ] by a factor @xmath41 , does not compensate the strong increase in binding energy ( @xmath42 ) and the ( @xmath2,@xmath5 )  reaction operates at significantly lower photon energies , and thus higher photon densities , than the ( @xmath2,@xmath4 )  reaction .",
    "very few experimental data on photodisintegration cross sections are available in the literature at the energies of interest for the p - process . for ( @xmath2,@xmath3 )  reactions most of the data",
    "have been measured around the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) with high precision ; however , close to the threshold , the data have typically much larger uncertainties @xcite .",
    "the situation is even worse for ( @xmath2,@xmath5 )  reactions , for which the rare available measurements have all been made at energies much higher than the gamow window ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "another difficulty comes from the fact that the p - nuclei are very little abundant naturally and that experiments on those nuclei usually require targets made of a considerable amount of highly enriched material .      in stellar environments nuclear excited states",
    "are thermally populated . at the high temperatures we consider",
    ", thermalization may enhance the photoreaction rates by several orders of magnitudes ( examples are found in sect .  [",
    "sec : brems ] ) .",
    "the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq : rate ] , which corresponds to photodisintegration from the ground state only , must then be replaced by a sum of the rates @xmath43 for photodisintegration from all ( ground and excited ) states @xmath44 , each term being weighted by the appropriate boltzmann factor . the true astrophysical rate @xmath45 is therefore defined by @xmath46 where , in @xmath43 , @xmath47 is replaced by the cross section @xmath48 for photodisintegration from state @xmath44 and where @xmath49 is the temperature - dependent normalized partition function of the target nucleus .",
    "although the gross effect of thermalization is a shift of the gamow window to lower photon energies by some mean excitation energy , it is mandatory to perform the sum explicitly ( or , if necessary , to integrate on a model level density for the target ) , when more than one excited level is populated , which is most often the case for relatively massive nuclei away from shell closures in the considered temperature range .",
    "clearly the multitude of astrophysical rates needed to describe the nucleosynthesis of the p - nuclei has to be calculated theoretically . in all existing p - process calculations ,",
    "reaction rates are calculated in the framework of the hauser - feshbach ( hf ) statistical model .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a description of the hf model and of its underlying hypothesis .",
    "let us just recall here that the hf cross section for the reaction @xmath50 where particle @xmath18 is captured on nucleus @xmath51 in excited state @xmath44 , leaving residual nucleus @xmath52 in state @xmath53 and particle or photon @xmath54 , is obtained from the transmission coefficients for the formation of or decay from all states @xmath55 of the compound nucleus which can be formed from the quantum numbers of the entrance channel .",
    "since in stellar conditions the target nucleus is in thermal equilibrium it can be shown @xcite that the astrophysical rates for the forward and reverse channels of the reaction @xmath56 are symmetrical and therefore obey reciprocity , which is not the case when the target nucleus is in its ground state only .",
    "this remains true when @xmath54 is a photon , so that the photodisintegration rate of a nucleus @xmath52 leading to particle @xmath18 and residual nucleus @xmath51 is directly proportional to the radiative capture rate of particle @xmath18 on @xmath51 , @xmath57 , where * means as before that the rate takes target thermalization into account .",
    "we want to emphasize here that as long as the conditions for the application of a statistical model for the reaction cross sections are met , which is the case to a large extend for typical p - process nuclear flows as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : p - proc ] , the uncertainties involved in any hf cross section calculation are essentially related to the evaluation of the nuclear quantities necessary for the calculation of the partition functions @xmath58 as well as the transmission coefficients entering the calculation of @xmath59 .",
    "not only the ground state properties ( masses , deformations , matter densities ) of the target and residual nuclei have to be known , or , when not available experimentally , have to be obtained from nuclear mass models , but the excited state properties are also indispensable . experimental data may be scarce , especially for nuclei located far from the valley of nuclear stability and frequent resort to a level density prescription is mandatory .",
    "the transmission coefficients for particle emission are calculated by solving the schrdinger equation with the appropriate optical potential for the particle - nucleus interaction .",
    "the case of the @xmath5-nucleus potential is of particular significance for the p - process but suffers from the scarcity of @xmath5-nucleus cross section measurements at sub - coulomb energies , especially for @xmath60 nuclei , and from the difficulties to construct theoretically global and reliable @xmath5-nucleus potentials ( see recent attempts in @xcite and @xcite for a review of the present situation ) .    in order to obtain reliable predictions for the astrophysical rates , a strict methodology is compulsory : calculated nuclear properties , constrained by indispensable but sporadic experiments , should rely on coherent sets of data , based whenever possible on microscopic models of the nucleus .",
    "extensive work along this line has been performed in the framework of the on - line library bruslib @xcite .",
    "the photon transmission function requires a particular attention in the case of photonuclear reactions and is calculated assuming the dominance of dipole e1 transitions .",
    "reaction theory relates the @xmath2-transmission coefficient for excited states to the ground state assuming the gdr is built on each excited state and has a lorentzian representation , at least for medium- and heavy - mass nuclei .",
    "experimental photoabsorption data confirm the simple semi - classical prediction of a lorentzian shape at energies around the resonance energy , but this description is less satisfactory at lower energies , and especially near the reaction threshold . even if a direct knowledge of the astrophysical rate of eq .  [ eq : astrorate ] is not accessible to experiments , photoreaction cross section measurements in the gamow window energy range will be extremely useful to improve our knowledge of the dipole strength functions at low energy .",
    "bremsstrahlung facilities provide intense photon radiation with energies up to the energy of the incoming electron beam . as shown in sect .  [",
    "sec : basic ] , the astrophysically relevant energy range is located at several mev .",
    "hence facilities with electron energies around 10mev are best suited for experiments of astrophysical interest .",
    "the photoactivation technique , obviously limited to reactions where an unstable nucleus is produced , has been chosen for the experiments using bremsstrahlung because a direct detection of the emitted particle is difficult in the huge bremsstrahlung background .",
    "additionally , the excellent energy resolution of @xmath2-ray detectors allows a clear detection of the individual reaction even in a chemically mixed target with natural isotopic composition .",
    "for example , a clear photoactivation signal has been observed for the @xmath61pt(@xmath2,@xmath3)@xmath62pt reaction with a @xmath61pt mass of about 100@xmath44 g ( i.e. 0.014% natural abundance of @xmath61pt in a 800 mg natural platinum target ) .",
    "the disadvantage of a low overall detection efficiency , which is of the order of a few per cent in the best cases , is compensated by the huge number of photons in the bremsstrahlung beam .",
    "this results in typical measuring times of a few days .    .",
    "experimental results for ( @xmath2,@xmath3 )  reaction rates , @xmath63 , for @xmath64 ( experimental uncertainties are given in parentheses ) .",

    "ta(@xmath2,n)@xmath106ta @xcite . ]      in nuclear astrophysics experiments , it is of crucial importance to provide absolute cross sections with high accuracy .",
    "here we describe a methodology for deducing reliable cross sections from quasi  monochromatic photon - induced reactions .",
    "the number of neutrons @xmath114 emitted in the photodisintegration experiment is related to the ( @xmath2,n ) cross section @xmath115 by its integral over the photon energy distribution @xmath116 : @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the number of target atoms per unit area , and @xmath119 is the correction factor for a thick - target measurement , @xmath120 ( with target thickness @xmath121 and attenuation coefficient of target material @xmath44 ) .",
    "it is obvious that for ideally monochromatic photons with energy @xmath37 , the integral is replaced by @xmath122 @xmath123 @xmath124 where @xmath122 is the number of incident photons .",
    "let us write @xmath115 as a taylor series , @xmath125    where @xmath126 .",
    "when the average energy is chosen for @xmath127 , putting the taylor series into the integral in eq .",

    "experimentally , from eqs .",
    "[ eq : sigma ] and [ eq : series ] , the bracketed taylor series in eq .",
    "[ eq : series ] is deduced from the numbers of neutrons ( @xmath134 ) and incident photons ( @xmath122 ) , as well as from the target properties . in order to obtain the cross section at the average @xmath2 energy , @xmath135",
    ", one has then to subtract the higher order terms @xmath136 , @xmath137 , etc .",
    "recently this procedure was exactly followed in the data reduction for the photodisintegration of @xmath107w @xcite .",
    "it was found that the subtraction resulted in only a few % increase in @xmath135 in the energy region of astrophysical relevance , where the energy dependence of the cross sections is dominated by the s - wave neutron emission ( @xmath32 in eq .",
    "[ eq : thres ] ) .",
    "thus , the lcs @xmath2 ray is very close to monochromaticity at the energies of astrophysical interest .",
    "because the thermal population of nuclear levels in stellar interiors has such a strong influence on the astrophysical photodisintegration rates , experimental studies on the photoresponse of nuclei below the particle threshold are of crucial importance for developing reliable models for such rates .",
    "in particular , a detailed knowledge about the structure of dipole excitations below the particle threshold is an important input for these models .    an ideal tool to investigate the photoresponse of nuclei below the particle threshold is real photon scattering or nuclear resonance fluorescence ( nrf ) @xcite .",
    "a `` white '' bremsstrahlung photon spectrum is produced by stopping an electron beam in a radiator target .",
    "this photon beam hits the target material and induces dipole and , to a lesser extent , quadrupole transitions to higher lying states .",
    "the @xmath2  decay of these states back to the ground and excited states is observed with high resolution ( @xmath138 ) hpge semiconductor detectors .",
    "the pure electromagnetic excitation mechanism allows one to derive absolute transition strength or decay width of the excited states without any model dependency . due to the high sensitivity of present set - ups one",
    "gets a rather complete picture of the dipole and quadrupole strength distribution in stable nuclei .",
    "very recently the bremsstrahlung experiments have been complemented by ( @xmath139 ) experiments using a polarized quasi ",
    "monochromatic photon beam from laser compton backscattering @xcite .",
    "this method gives easy access to additional observables like parities and weak decay branchings .",
    "the photoresponse of atomic nuclei is dominated by the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) .",
    "however , recent measurements have shown that a considerable part of the electric dipole strength remains in the 1@xmath140  region i.e.  around about 7 mev in stable nuclei @xcite and is not shifted to the gdr . in heavier nuclei",
    "this strength seems to be concentrated in a resonance like distribution of 1@xmath141  states .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : e1distribution ] for the @xmath142 isotones .",
    "the concentration of states between 6 and 8 mev and the lack of strength at higher energies shows that these are not just statistical e1 excitations riding on the tail of the gdr but that the states have their own nuclear stucture .",
    "the summed e1 strength in this energy region exhausts up to one percent of the isovector energy weighted sum rule .",
    "a similar concentration of e1 strength has been found in lighter nuclei as well @xcite .",
    "isotones @xmath143ba , @xmath144ce , @xmath145nd , and @xmath146sm . ]    in exotic nuclei with large neutron excess , up to 10% of the total isovector e1 strength has been found at very low energies , both in photodissociation and in coulomb excitation experiments in inverse kinematics @xcite .",
    "these experiments are a useful complement to the high precision ( @xmath15 ) experiments on nuclei in the valley of stability .",
    "the structure of the e1 excitations is still under intense discussion .",
    "triggered by the experimental observation that nuclei with neutron separation energies of less than s@xmath147=10 mev possess a neutron skin , several models describe the mode as an oscillation of this skin versus the proton / neutron core @xcite .",
    "in addition several microscopic calculations explain a considerable part of the e1 strength as a dominant isoscalar mode @xcite .",
    "upcoming experiments will extend the systematics of the e1 strength distribution , will measure additional observables like the isospin character and detailed branching ratios and will look into the e1 response of exotic heavy nuclei .",
    "this will hopefully allow a deeper insight into the structure of the e1 modes around the particle threshold and finally allow more reliable model calculations of reaction rates with predictive power .",
    "one question raised by the p - process studies is to know to what extend the calculated p - nuclei abundances do reproduce the solar system ones .",
    "a variety of explosive stellar sites in which matter is heated to temperatures in the range @xmath1483.5 succeed in synthesizing p - nuclides with relative abundances in rough agreement with the solar system isotopic content .",
    "the only serious discrepancy concerns the large isotopic ratios of the mo and ru p - nuclei in the solar system ( of the order of 10% of the corresponding elemental abundances ) , for which no satisfactory explanation has been found so far ( see @xcite for an updated discussion of this problem ) .",
    "the remaining less significant differences can be attributed to problems with the nuclear physics involved or with an inappropriate choice and/or a bad description of the stellar site(s ) assumed to be at the origin of the solar system p - nuclei .",
    "any reduction in the nuclear physics uncertainties will therefore put better constraints on the determination of the astrophysical sites to consider .",
    "as far as the global p - nuclei production is concerned and considering the very large number of nuclear reactions involved in the production of even a single p - nucleus , it is difficult to pinpoint one critical experimental information on which nuclear physicists should focus .",
    "rather , any measurement of a photodisintegration cross section on nuclei which are located as close as possible to the p - process path and for energies in the appropriate gamow windows should help gaining more confidence in the calculated rates , in particular in getting direct insight into the e1-strength function near particle threshold energies and in obtaining more reliable astrophysical photodisintegration rates without having to resort to detailed balance calculations .",
    "other problems raised by the p - process nucleosynthesis concern the production of the rare odd - odd nuclei @xmath106ta@xmath149 and @xmath143la . in both cases ( @xmath2,@xmath3 )  reaction rates on these nuclei and on their much more abundant neighbors @xmath105ta and @xmath110la are the essential nuclear quantities which will determine their final abundances .    the rarest stable nucleus in the solar system and the only naturally occurring isomer , @xmath106ta@xmath149 , has been shown by @xcite to be a natural product of the p - process in sne - ii .",
    "this conclusion was also largely shared by @xcite , with different stellar models and updated reaction rates . as seen in sect .",
    "[ sec : lcs ] , the measurement of the @xmath105ta(@xmath2,n)@xmath106ta reaction cross section at energies close to the neutron threshold has provided a unique opportunity to improve the description of the e1-strength function and to obtain a more precise estimate of the astrophysical rate for that reaction .",
    "the problem of the @xmath106ta production has been re - examined in @xcite in the case of a 25 m@xmath150 model star with solar metallicity , using the @xmath105ta(@xmath2,n)@xmath106ta rate constrained by the aist experiment .",
    "the previous prediction that @xmath106ta@xmath149 is produced at the same level as the bulk of p - nuclides in sne - ii has been quantitatively confirmed for a 25 m@xmath150 sn - ii and there are no reasons why different conclusions would be reached when the @xmath106ta@xmath149 productions calculated for other stellar masses will be averaged over a stellar mass function , as done in @xcite .",
    "but on the other hand , the p - process origin of @xmath106ta@xmath149 has to be confronted to the fact that this nuclide might @xcite or might not @xcite be produced by the s - process in agb stars and that it is also expected to receive some contribution from @xmath151-captures on pre - existing @xmath106hf @xcite .",
    "the rare odd - odd nucleus @xmath143la is generally underproduced in p - process calculations although it has been found recently that exploding sub - chandrasekhar - mass co white dwarfs could be significant @xmath143la producers @xcite .",
    "the problem of the @xmath143la underproduction in more conventional p - process sites like sne - ii has been addressed in @xcite .",
    "two reactions are critical for the thermonuclear production of that nuclide , ( 1 ) @xmath110la(@xmath2,n)@xmath143la and ( 2 ) @xmath143la(@xmath2,n)@xmath152la . in order to produce @xmath143la at the mean level of p - nuclide production in the 25 m@xmath150 model star considered in @xcite , the ratio of the rates for reaction ( 1 ) to reaction ( 2 ) had to be increased by a factor 2025 with respect to the ratio obtained with hf ( most ) calculated rates .",
    "such a large increase was very unlikely in view of an analysis of the nuclear physics uncertainties in the hf calculations . on the other hand @xcite",
    "also re - examined the neutrino production of @xmath143la , originally proposed by @xcite , using an improved treatment of the ( anti-)neutrino interactions , and confirmed that neutrino processes can compensate the thermonuclear underproduction of @xmath143la . however , if many of the input data necessary to calculate hf reaction rates have been measured for @xmath110la , in contrast , very little is known experimentally for @xmath152la or @xmath143la .",
    "clearly the measurement of ( @xmath2,@xmath3 )  cross sections on @xmath110la and @xmath143la are very desirable to disentangle the weak interaction and thermonuclear origins of @xmath143la .",
    "experimental values for the ( @xmath2,@xmath3 )  reaction on @xmath110la will soon be available from recent measurements at aist .",
    "similar measurements on @xmath143la are a very stimulating challenge for the future !",
    "synchrotron radiation facilities of the third generation are constructed in europe ( esrf ) , america ( aps ) and japan ( spring-8 ) .",
    "they feature a variety of insertion devices as light sources . at spring-8 , a 10 tesla super - conducting wiggler ( scw )",
    "was installed at the 8 gev storage ring for a test production of a high - energy radiation .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scw ] , this radiation resulting from a 100 ma electron current is intense , even near neutron thresholds around 8 mev ( 10@xmath153 photons sec@xmath68 mev@xmath68 for a 10 t magnetic field ) @xcite .",
    "more importantly , it is characterized by exponential tails which mimic the high energy part of planck spectra corresponding to temperatures reached during the p - process .",
    "the scw radiation can thus be used to directly determine the photonuclear reaction rate in eq .",
    "[ eq : rate ] by activation techniques without such manipulation as the superposition of several bremsstrahlung spectra with different end - point energies @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the experimental parameters ( @xmath154 and @xmath30 ) involved in the threshold behavior of the photoneutron cross section in eq .",
    "[ eq : thres ] can be determined from a few measurements of the reaction rate with the scw radiation at the highest available magnetic fields .",
    "note that @xmath30 should be treated as an experimental parameter , because of a possible mixture of s- and p - wave neutron emissions .",
    "there is a long list of photoreactions of interest for the p - process ( not listed here ) which can be studied with the scw radiation at spring-8 .",
    "the photodisintegration of @xmath106ta is certainly among them with a high priority .",
    "the study of the photodisintegration of neutron deficient radioactive nuclei along the p - process path is also one important future project .",
    "coulomb dissociation into the neutron channel where outgoing nucleus and neutron are measured in coincidence , is a promising experimental technique , the development of which is being considered at gsi .",
    "the bremsstrahlung and the monochromatic lcs beam play complementary roles in the study of photon - induced reactions . with its intense photon source ,",
    "the former technique allows photoactivation with natural target material because of the high sensitivity to radioactive species .",
    "a ground state photoreaction rate is determined with a superposition method which approximates the planck distribution .",
    "the scw radiation has the further advantage to be also able to determine the threshold behavior of ( @xmath2,@xmath3 )  cross sections .",
    "the latter photon source allows the cross section measurement over the gamow window , which is the most direct way of testing the hf calculations of the rates .",
    "the direct neutron counting can be applied to any nuclei in principle , but in practice is limited to nuclei for which a considerable amount of enriched target material can be made available .",
    "it must be stressed however that there are presently certain regions in the valley of stability that are accessible neither by photoactivation nor by direct neutron counting , because some photoreactions result in the production of stable nuclei or of radioactive nuclei with extremely long half - lives , and because target preparation is made difficult for nuclei with very small natural abundances .",
    "obviously , the emergence of a high - intensity monochromatic photon source is awaited with great interest .",
    "photon - induced reactions , ( @xmath2,x ) ( x= n , p , @xmath5 , @xmath2 ) , have a direct impact on the nucleosynthesis of the p - nuclei . among those ,",
    "only ( @xmath2,n ) reactions of direct interest for astrophysics have been investigated for selected nuclei , by photoactivation with bremsstrahlung and by direct neutron counting with the lcs @xmath2-ray beam .",
    "the experimental data enhance the reliability and the predictive power of the hauser - feshbach model calculations of the astrophysical reaction rates .",
    "the measurement of ( @xmath2,@xmath3 )   reactions on many more nuclei will follow , but the investigation of ( @xmath2,@xmath5 ) and ( @xmath2,p ) reactions in the energy range of interest is still a challenging prospect .",
    "in addition , the e1 and m1 @xmath2 strength functions below particle thresholds should be addressed in direct relation to photoreactions on nuclear excited states under stellar conditions .",
    "photoreactions on unstable nuclei are however beyond the present scope except with the virtual photon source , coulomb excitation / dissociation .    as demonstrated by the emergence of bremsstrahlung and laser inverse compton @xmath2 rays , followed by the scw synchrotron radiation",
    ", the development of lasers , accelerators and of related technologies will give fresh impetus to the creation of new @xmath2-ray sources of great value for nuclear astrophysics .",
