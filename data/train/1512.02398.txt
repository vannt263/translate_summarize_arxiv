    "the rich phase diagram exhibited by iron pnictides @xcite including magnetic , structural , and superconducting phase transitions @xcite have stimulated intensive investigations aimed at detailed understanding of their macroscopic physical behavior in terms of their complex multi - orbital electronic structure as revealed by first - principle calculations @xcite and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments @xcite .",
    "the magnetic state exhibits @xmath0 magnetic ordering of fe moments in the @xmath7 plane , with a concomitant structural distortion @xmath8 , possibly correlated with the ferro orbital order @xmath9 as seen in arpes studies @xcite .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering studies of magnetic excitations in iron pnictides have been carried out extensively @xcite , and clearly reveal well defined spin wave excitations with energy scale @xmath10 200 mev , persisting even above the nel temperature @xcite , indicating that short range antiferromagnetic ( af ) and ferromagnetic ( f ) order remain in the @xmath5 and @xmath4 directions , respectively , even above the disordering temperature for long - range magnetic order .",
    "this persistence of short range anisotropic magnetic order may account for the narrow nematic phase @xcite above the nel temperature where the ferro orbital order @xcite and structural distortion survive , as well as the temperature dependence of the measured anisotropies in @xmath5 and @xmath4 directions of magnetic excitations and resistivity @xcite .",
    "spin wave excitations in iron pnictides have been theoretically studied for multi - band models @xcite in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , including the orbital matrix components of the spin wave spectral weight @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the intra - orbital coulomb interaction term considered in these investigations typically lie in the intermediate coupling range ( @xmath11 ev ) , resulting in moderately well developed local moments in the @xmath0 magnetic state , which has interesting implications on the multi - orbital quantum antiferromagnetism in these compounds . in this paper",
    "we will study the effective spin couplings generated by particle - hole exchange , their orbital contributions , and quantum corrections to sublattice magnetization in the @xmath0 af state of a realistic three - orbital model which yields fermi surface structure , spin wave excitations , and ferro orbital ordering in quantitative agreement with experiments .",
    "one important feature of the measured spin wave dispersion is that the spin wave energy is maximum at the ferromagnetic zone boundary ( fzb ) , slightly higher than at the antiferromagnetic zone boundary ( afzb ) .",
    "this feature is quite significant as the fzb spin wave energy provides a sensitive measure of the effective ferromagnetic ( f ) spin coupling in the @xmath0 state @xcite .",
    "it is only when f spin coupling is included that the fzb spin wave energy becomes finite , and even maximum over the entire brillouin zone when it exceeds the af spin coupling .",
    "understanding the microscopic mechanism behind the origin of this strong f spin coupling and its interplay with the complex multi - orbital electronic structure as observed in iron pnictides should provide significant insight toward understanding the multi - orbital antiferromagnetism in these compounds .",
    "the structure of this paper is as below . following a brief account in section ii of the realistic three band model for iron pnictides in terms of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 fe 3d orbitals ,",
    "the effective spin couplings are introduced in section iii in terms of the particle - hole propagator @xmath12 $ ] evaluated in the @xmath0 magnetic state .",
    "evaluation of quantum corrections to sublattice magnetization is discussed in section iv in terms of transverse spin correlations @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "results for the calculated effective spin couplings , quantum corrections , and discussion of their variation with @xmath3 orbital energy offset are presented in section v , followed by conclusions in section vi .",
    "we consider a minimal three - orbital model @xcite involving @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 fe @xmath19 orbitals .",
    "the tight binding hamiltonian in the plane - wave basis is defined as : @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the tight - binding matrix elements in the unfolded brillouin zone ( @xmath22 ) . here ,",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 are the intra - orbital hoppings for @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) along @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) and @xmath26 ( @xmath25 ) directions , respectively , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the intra and inter - orbital hoppings along diagonal direction for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are intra - orbital nn and nnn hoppings for @xmath3 , while @xmath31 and @xmath32 the nn and nnn hybridization between @xmath3 and @xmath33 .",
    "finally , @xmath34 is the energy difference between the @xmath3 and degenerate @xmath33 orbitals .",
    ".values of the hopping parameters in the three - orbital model ( in ev ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     with the total ( orbital summed ) quantum correction to sublattice magnetization @xmath35 , and the total hf level sublattice magnetization @xmath36 , the orbital - averaged reduction in sublattice magnetization due to quantum spin fluctuation induced quantum corrections in the @xmath0 af state of the three band model is quite significant at about @xmath6 .",
    "originating from particle - hole exchange , effective spin couplings @xmath37 for first and second neighbors were evaluated in the @xmath0 magnetic state of a realistic three band interacting electron model for iron pnictides involving @xmath38 fe 3d orbitals .",
    "variation of these spin couplings with the @xmath3 orbital energy offset provides valuable insight into the multi - orbital quantum antiferromagnetism in these compounds .",
    "the @xmath3 orbital was found to be mainly responsible for the generation of strong f spin coupling between first neighbors in the @xmath4 direction , which is critically required to fully account for the spin wave dispersion measured from inelastic neutron scattering experiments .",
    "the f spin coupling is strongly suppressed with decreasing orbital order as the @xmath3 band approaches half filling , and is ascribed , as in metallic ferromagnets , to particle - hole exchange in the partially filled @xmath3 band , which provides the microscopic basis for the negative ( ferromagnetic ) exchange interaction ( @xmath39 ) as considered in phenomenological spin models .",
    "significantly , the strongest af spin coupling between first neighbors in the @xmath5 direction lies in the orbital off diagonal sector involving the @xmath1 and @xmath3 orbitals , highlighting the important role of strong orbital hybridization on effective spin couplings .",
    "while the af spin coupling in @xmath5 direction for the half - filled @xmath2 orbital was found to be constant with increasing @xmath3 orbital energy offset , the frustrating af spin coupling in @xmath4 direction for the @xmath1 orbital was found to decrease , thus reducing the magnetic frustration substantially .",
    "the hund s rule coupling term was found to contribute significantly to the effective spin couplings and therefore to the overall stabilization of the @xmath0 magnetic state .",
    "the first - order spin - fluctuation induced quantum corrections to sublattice magnetization were evaluated from the transverse spin correlations , and yield maximum reduction for the overfilled @xmath1 orbital and minimum reduction for the half filled @xmath2 orbital . the orbital - averaged reduction in sublattice magnetization due to quantum spin fluctuations in the @xmath0 af state of the three band model",
    "was found to be significant at about @xmath6 .",
