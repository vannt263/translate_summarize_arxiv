    "the determination of the abundance distributions provides an important constraint for evolution models of galaxies .",
    "these abundances which are traditionally obtained through spectroscopic means , although other approaches have also been developed , are beset with large uncertainties . in this letter",
    "we discuss a totally independent determination of the galactic metallicity ( @xmath2 ) distribution with the help of beat cepheids ( bcs hereafter ) which promises to have a good accuracy .",
    "our approach is sensitive to the opacity , and as such it is sensitive to the iron group elements , but it is relatively insensitive to the chemical makeup of @xmath2 , and to @xmath4 as well .",
    "cepheids are young , intermediate mass , bright , periodic variable stars . while in the core he burning evolutionary phase , they lie in an area of the hr diagram , the instability strip where their envelopes are vibrationally unstable through the kappa mechanism @xcite .",
    "they undergo radial pulsations , most of them periodic , in a single mode ( either the fundamental mode , f , the first overtone , o1 , or the second overtone , o2 ) .",
    "a small fraction of them , called double - mode cepheids or beat cepheids ( bcs ) , are pulsating _ simultaneously _ in two radial modes .",
    "these pulsations are observed to be either a mixture of the fundamental and the first overtone modes f / o1 , or of the first and the second overtones o1/o2 .",
    "it useful to plot the period ratios period , a petersen diagram ( pd ) named after @xcite .",
    "it is well known that a comparison in a pd of the bcs in our galaxy , lmc and smc shows that the period ratios of f / o1 depend strongly on metallicity   ( unlike o1/o2 bcs ) .",
    "this behavior has been taken advantage of to constrain stellar models , ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) or to test galactic distances ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the m33 late spiral galaxy is known to exhibit a fairly steep metallicity distribution . since @xcite various groups have used hii regions to estimate the [ o / h ] distribution in m33 .",
    "@xcite found an [ o / h ] gradient ( i.e. abundance versus deprojected galacto - centric radius ) of 0.11 dex / kpc in agreement with earlier work .",
    "the first studies with b type supergiant stars yielded a gradient of @xmath5 @xcite , although a more recent estimatation @xcite gave @xmath6 , which is also the value obtained through an analysis of red giant branch photometry by @xcite . from planetary nebulae @xcite",
    "derive a metallicity gradient of 0.14 .",
    "a recent study of hii regions by @xcite however revises the [ o / h ] gradient to @xmath7 dex / kpc , much shallower than all the other ones .",
    "as the data of the above references show , one should keep in mind though that representing the metallicity distribution as a gradient may be a gross oversimplification .",
    "the m33 variability survey @xcite is a wide - field ( one square degree ) survey of this galaxy , conducted with the canada - france - hawaii telescope , in the @xmath8 filters , and the first two years of data are available with more than 80000 light curves .",
    "this survey is particularly well suited for variable stars with periods of the order of a few days to a few weeks .",
    "the excellent relative photometry obtained with the image subtraction technique @xcite has given us the opportunity to search for bcs at 840 kpc .",
    "these bcs allow us then to determine the metallicity gradient across the m33 galaxy .",
    "a set of 3023 cepheid candidates was identified from @xcite and periods were determined simultaneously using the one way analysis of variance , aov @xcite , as implemented for the eros project @xcite .",
    "this phase dispersion minimization method is based on strong statistical tests and constitutes a powerful way of searching for periodic signals of arbitrary shapes , and a confidence level is returned for each trial period .",
    "each star has a light curve comprising typically 33 measurements in each sloan band @xmath9 .",
    "we chose the @xmath10 band data in our analysis because of the highest signal to noise ratio .",

    "the acceptable models are those for which both the f and o1 modes are linearly unstable .",
    "we note here that the use of linear periods is adequate because nonlinear periods differ at most in the fourth decimal figure ( @xcite ) .    in fig .",

    "the adopted composition values , @xmath33 and @xmath2 , are indicated in each subfigure .",
    "not all values can represent actual cepheids because the latter move along evolutionary tracks .",
    "stellar evolution calculations show that in first approximation these tracks are horizontal in an hr diagram , @xmath0 = @xmath0(@xmath1 ) .",
    "this allows us to narrow down the acceptable bc models . in fig .",
    "[ fig_ml ] we therefore superpose a sample of evolutionary relations .",
    "the solid curves represent those of @xcite as a function of @xmath0 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 .",
    "the short and long dashed curves are derived from @xcite and @xcite , respectively , some of them interpolated to the appropriate composition .",
    "this set of curves should bracket the uncertainties that are inherent in the evolutionary track calculations .",
    "note that in the @xmath0-@xmath1 diagram , in contrast to the loci the curves are relatively insensitive to @xmath2 .",
    "one notes that for each star the width @xmath34 ( and @xmath35 ) of the models that satisfy the period constraints turn out to be narrow and comparable to the uncertainty in the evolutionary relations .",
    "one also notes that as the metallicity increases , the curves systematically move to the right ( to larger @xmath0 ) in a similar fashion for each star .",
    "the loci first shift very slowly rightward , but once in the broad vicinity of the curves , they accelerate and cross this region very rapidly , and then slow down again .",
    "this very fortunate feature allows us to put tight limits on the metallicity of each star , despite the spread in the relations and despite the spread in .    from fig .",
    "[ fig_ml ] we can therefore read off the metallicities of the 5 stars .",
    "star c , for example , crosses the relations when z=0.011 . considering that for z=0.010 and z=0.012 star c is comfortably on either side of the possible relations , we estimate conservatively that our determination of @xmath2 is better than @xmath36 0.001 .",
    "we have verified that a small change of @xmath4 away from the used values has only a minor effect on the loci .",
    "the metallicities that we infer this way for each star are reported in table  [ tab : model ] .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations and the amplitude equation formalism demonstrate that beat pulsations can occur only in a subregion of the region where the f and the o1 modes are linearly unstable ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it may therefore be possible to further narrow down the metallicity of bcs , but this will require an extended survey with nonlinear numerical hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "table  [ tab : model ] also displays the metallicities that are inferred for our bcs from the standard metallicity gradient , @xcite .",
    "the agreement is found to be excellent although star c has a somewhat high @xmath2 in our study . on the other hand ,",
    "our results are incompatible with those derived from the revised gradient of @xcite .    from our @xmath2 values and from the galacto - centric distances of the 5 bcs",
    "we derive a metallicity gradient dlog(@xmath2)/dr = 0.2 dex / kpc which translates to an [ o / h ] gradient of 0.16 dex / kpc that is in good agreement with the standard determinations , and rules out the shallow revised one .",
    "let us reexamine our derived metallicities in light of fig .",
    "[ fig : prat ] in which we have plotted a pd for all the known f / o1 beat cepheids in the galaxy , in the lmc @xcite and in the smc @xcite .",
    "we also show the best linear fits for all 3 galaxies ( although there is no theoretical reason for the constant @xmath2 curves to be straight lines ) .",
    "our 5 bcs from m33 are plotted as solid hexagons .",
    "the 2 stars a and b , with the highest period ratios , lie approximately in the continuation of the smc cepheids , and indeed their derived metallicities of @xmath370.004 and @xmath370.005 agree with that of the smc ( @xmath2=0.004 ) .",
    "the star c with a derived @xmath38 , falls between the lmc ( @xmath2=0.008 ) and the galactic bcs ( @xmath2=0.020 ) . finally , the remaining two stars , d and e , have the lowest period ratios , 0.7015 and 0.7005 , and with derived @xmath39 and @xmath40 , lie between the lmc and galactic bcs .",
    "it is important to stress that fig .",
    "[ fig : prat ] uses _ only observed quantities _ , namely periods and is therefore independent of any theoretical modeling .",
    "with a little act of faith one could have predicted the @xmath2 of the 5 m33 bcs , although for 3 of these 5 stars a huge extrapolation would have been required .",
    "our calculations suggest that such an extrapolation , whether linear of curved , may be warranted .",
    "however , it will be necessary to make a detailed survey of linear and nonlinear bc models to ascertain with what precision the mere location of a bc in the pd is able to provide an empirical estimate of its metallicity .",
    "it has been suggested that stellar rotation may falsify the use of the pd as a metallicity indicator as for delta scuti stars @xcite .",
    "we have checked that for cepheid models , and for their lower rotation rates , the rotational effect on the pd is negligible .",
    "[ fig : prat ] shows that 4 of the 5 m33 bcs have extremely large periods when compared to the known mc and galactic bcs .",
    "clearly , the faintness of m33 precludes the detection of low luminosity ( and thus short period ) cepheids .",
    "but why are the mcs and the galaxy devoid of such large period bcs ?",
    "it is not clear at this time whether this is a selection effect or an evolutionary effect ( e.g. the horizontal tracks not extending far enough blueward ) or a pulsational effect ( the occurrence of beat behavior is fragile in the sense that it can be easily affected by small changes in astrophysical parameters such as the chemical makeup ) , or whether some other effect is responsible .    0.5 cm    to finish it is worth reflecting on why this procedure of determining the metallicity of bcs merely on the basis of the two observed periods works so well .",
    "there are two reasons :  first , cepheids evolve along tracks , @xmath41 ; to the extent that these are approximately horizontal we can assume a relation in the form @xmath42 ;  second , the subclass of the bcs lies in a narrow substrip of the cepheid instability strip ( kollth 1998 , 2001 , 2002 ) ; thus , for a given @xmath0 and metallicity @xmath2 , the effective temperature is restricted to lie in a narrow range , @xmath43 .",
    "these two constraining relations , plus those of the two measured periods therefore provide the 4 relations that are necessary to uniquely specify the cepheid model ( @xmath1 , @xmath0 , ) and its composition @xmath2 .",
    "we have searched for beat cepheids in the database of the deep cfht m33 variability survey , and we have uncovered 5 of them that are pulsating in the fundamental and first overtone modes . with the use of stellar pulsational modeling and evolutionary relations",
    "we have derived the metallicities of these bcs . from the galacto - centric distance @xmath44 of the bcs",
    "we have inferred a pulsational metallicity gradient dlog @xmath2/dr = 0.2 dex / kpc that translates to an [ o / h ] metallicity gradient of 0.16 dex / kpc , in good agreement with the other determinations in the literature , but it rules out the revised value of @xcite .",
    "we stress that this pulsational method of probing the galactic metallicity distribution is independent of spectroscopic or other techniques that have previously been used . +",
    "this work is based on observations with mega prime / megacam , a joint project of cfht and cea / dapnia , at the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) which is operated by the nrc of canada , the institute national des sciences de lunivers of the cnrs of france , and the university of hawaii .",
    "we express our gratitude to the cfht staff at mauna kea for conducting the service mode observations on which this study is based .",
