    "search problems with lies have been studied in many different settings ( see surveys deppe @xcite and pelc @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we deal with the model when a fixed number , @xmath1 , of the answers may be false , which we call lies .",
    "there are also several models depending on what kind of questions are allowed as well , the most famous being the rnyi - ulam game . in this paper",
    "we deal with the case when we are given @xmath0 different elements and we can use pairwise comparisons to decide which element is bigger from the two .",
    "the problem of finding the maximum ( or the minimum ) element with @xmath1 lies was first solved by ravikumar et al .",
    "they have shown that @xmath4 comparisons are necessary and sufficient .",
    "the topic of this paper is finding the maximum and the minimum .",
    "if all answers have to be correct then the minimum number of comparisons needed is @xmath5 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "aigner in @xcite proved that @xmath6 comparisons are always sufficient .",
    "it was proved by gerbner et al .",
    "@xcite that if @xmath7 , then @xmath8 comparisons are necessary and sufficient .",
    "we also made the conjecture that for general @xmath1 , there is an algorithm using only @xmath9 comparisons where @xmath10 tends to @xmath11 as @xmath1 tends to infinity .",
    "hoffmann et al .",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath12 comparisons are sufficient for some absolute constant @xmath13 ( whose value is less than @xmath14 but no attempts to optimize it were made yet ) . until now",
    "the best lower bound on @xmath10 was @xmath15 by aigner @xcite .",
    "the main result of this paper is the following theorem .",
    "[ main ] at least @xmath16 comparisons are needed in the worst case to find the largest and the smallest element if there might be @xmath1 erroneous answers",
    ".    this bound is tight for @xmath17 ( see theorem [ max ] ) but not for @xmath7 as shown in @xcite and using a slightly more involved argument than the one presented here it is easy to see that the bound can be simply improved for any @xmath18 .",
    "the reason why the theorem is presented in this `` weak '' form is that it already disproves the conjecture and the argument is simply , yet gives a perfectly matching bound for @xmath17 . to find",
    "a stronger version would involve a thorough case analysis , similar to the one in @xcite and improving the constant a bit is uninteresting at the moment .",
    "it would be more interesting to study the behavior of @xmath10 in future works .",
    "now we know that @xmath19 .",
    "but is @xmath10 monotonously increasing as @xmath1 grows ?",
    "this would imply , of course , the existence of a limit , which is likely to exist .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "@xmath20 we develop a method to increase the lower bound by @xmath1 for many search problems and give proofs using it for some known results . in section",
    "@xmath21 we prove our main result , theorem [ main ] .",
    "in this section , as a warm - up , we prove a very general result that holds for all search problems and generally gives an additional constant to the lower bounds that are proved using a consistent adversary .",
    "[ kmore ] suppose we have a search problem where we want to determine the value of some function @xmath22 using ( not necessarily yes - no ) questions from a family of allowed questions .",
    "the answers are given by an adversary who can lie at most @xmath1 times .",
    "suppose that we have already asked some questions and the answers we got are consistent , i.e. it is possible that none of them is a lie .",
    "if we do not yet know the value of @xmath22 , then we need at least @xmath23 further questions to determine it .",
    "this claim has an immediate , quite weak corollary .    if there is a search problem as in claim [ kmore ] with a non - trivial @xmath22",
    ", then we need at least @xmath24 questions to determine @xmath22 .",
    "although it is not too standard , we first give a proof of the corollary , as it is a simplified version of the proof of the claim .",
    "take two possible elements of the universe , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , for which @xmath27 .",
    "the adversary can answer the first @xmath1 questions according to @xmath25 and the next @xmath1 questions according to @xmath26 , thus after @xmath28 questions both are still possible .",
    "@xmath29 @xmath30    * proof of claim [ kmore ] .",
    "* suppose we have already asked some consistent questions , i.e. there is an @xmath25 such that they are all true for @xmath25 .",
    "however , if we do not yet know @xmath22 , there is a @xmath26 for which at most @xmath1 of these questions would be false , such that @xmath27 . we can answer the next @xmath1 questions according to @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath31 to show the power of this simple claim , let us prove the following theorem .",
    "[ max ] to find the maximum among @xmath0 elements using comparisons of which @xmath1 might be incorrect , we need @xmath4 comparisons in the worst case .",
    "the upper bound follows from using any tournament scheme and comparing any two elements until one of them is bigger than the other @xmath23 times .",
    "this is @xmath32 plus the possible @xmath1 lies that might prolong our search .    to prove the lower bound ,",
    "answer the first @xmath33 questions consistently .",
    "now we have an element that was always bigger , and another that was the smaller one at most @xmath1 times , thus the conditions of claim [ kmore ] are satisfied , so we need @xmath23 more questions .",
    "we start with defining some standard terminology .",
    "define the actual _ comparison graph _ as a directed graph whose vertices are the elements and it has an edge for every comparison between the compared elements , directed from the bigger towards the smaller .",
    "we say that the comparison graph is _ consistent _ if there is no directed cycle in the comparison graph . in this case",
    "any vertex with in - degree at most @xmath1 can still be the maximum element and any vertex with out - degree at most @xmath1 can still be the minimum element .",
    "we also denote the comparison graph after the first @xmath34 questions by @xmath35 .",
    "so if there are no lies among the first @xmath34 answers , then they are necessarily consistent and there is no directed cycle in @xmath35",
    ".      * proof of theorem 1 .",
    "* we have to give an adversary argument , i.e. , for every possible comparing algorithm , we have to give answers such that it is not possible to determine with less than @xmath37 questions the maximum and the minimum .",
    "our answers will be always consistent , i.e. , that there will be no directed cycle in the comparison graph .",
    "first , we suppose that @xmath0 is even and the ( undirected ) edges of @xmath38 ( the graph of the first @xmath39 questions ) form a perfect matching , i.e. , every element is compared exactly once during the first @xmath39 comparisons .",
    "denote the set of elements that were bigger in their first comparison by @xmath40 and the ones that were smaller by @xmath41 .",
    "whenever in the future an element from @xmath40 is compared to an element from @xmath41 , we always answer that the one from @xmath40 is bigger . this way the problem reduces to finding the maximum from @xmath39 elements and the minimum from @xmath39 other elements .",
    "every vertex but one from @xmath40 must have in - degree at least @xmath23 at the end and , similarly , every vertex but one from @xmath41 must have out - degree at least @xmath23 at the end .",
    "therefore after @xmath42 comparisons we still can not know both the maximum and the minimum , and the answers we got are all consistent , thus we need @xmath23 more questions because of claim [ kmore ] .",
    "this implies that at least @xmath43 comparisons are needed in the worst case .    in general , define the sets @xmath40 and @xmath41 to be empty at the beginning and whenever an element is first compared , put it to @xmath40 if it is bigger and to @xmath41 if it is smaller than the element it is compared to .",
    "whenever we compare and element from @xmath40 with an element from @xmath41 , always the @xmath40 one will be bigger , so the maximum will be in @xmath40 and the minimum in @xmath41 . at the end of the algorithm every element must be assigned to @xmath40 or @xmath41 .",
    "denote the number of elements that are put to @xmath40 by @xmath44 and the number of the ones that are put to @xmath41 by @xmath45 ( so we have @xmath46 ) .",
    "it is clear that there are at least @xmath47 questions that compare at least one element that was not compared before .",
    "also note , that if we compare two elements one of which is not in @xmath40 , then the in - degree of the vertices in @xmath40 will not increase .",
    "therefore we need at least @xmath48 comparisons inside @xmath40 .",
    "we similarly need at least @xmath49 comparisons inside @xmath41 .",
    "therefore after @xmath50 comparisons we still can not know both the maximum and the minimum , and the answers we got are all consistent , thus we can apply claim [ kmore ] .",
    "this implies that at least @xmath36 comparisons are needed in the worst case .",
    "note that this equals @xmath51 , which for @xmath17 is @xmath52 , matching the best algorithm and the result of @xcite .",
