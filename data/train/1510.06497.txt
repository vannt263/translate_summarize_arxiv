    "first of all , our paper is motivated by recent very accurate experimental measurements of the electron - proton elastic scattering at the mainz microtron ( mami ) @xcite .",
    "the average point - to - point errors in the cross sections measurement was of the order of a few permille .",
    "besides extraction of the proton electromagnetic form factors , the experiment managed to define the value of the proton electric charge radius with high precision .",
    "it is worth to note that the result for the charge radius extracted from the electron - proton scattering data was found to be inconsistent with the one obtained from muonic hydrogen  @xcite .",
    "the disagreement stimulates theoretical studies aimed at its resolution . in the present paper we are going to discuss several effects which can affect the data analysis of low - energy elastic electron - proton scattering .",
    "the high precision of the experimental measurement of the differential cross section provides the clear requirement on the magnitude of effects which should be taken into account .",
    "we assume that aiming at the one - permille accuracy , we have to treat systematically all relative corrections being at least of @xmath0 size .",
    "let us consider the process [ proc ] e(p_1 ) + p(p_1 ) e(p_2 ) + p(p_2 ) + ( n ,  e^+e^- ) .",
    "the initial electron energy @xmath1 is of the order 1  gev , @xmath2 .",
    "the momentum transfer squared @xmath3 will be taken in the range @xmath4  gev@xmath5 which was explored in the experiment .",
    "note that the condition @xmath6 holds for the whole range .",
    "the differential cross section @xmath7 of process  ( [ proc ] ) will be considered .",
    "one - loop qed corrections to the process under consideration are well known .",
    "they are naturally separated into the following parts : +  real and virtual corrections to the electron line , +  real and virtual corrections to the proton line , +  interference of amplitudes of the first two types , +  the effect due to vacuum polarization .",
    "the corresponding analytic results were reproduced in  @xcite '' should appear in the first term in square brackets . ] among one - loop corrections , there is still an open discussion about the proper treatment of double photon exchange contributions , see e.g. papers  @xcite and references therein .",
    "we agree with the importance of this point , but it goes beyond the scope of our present study .    to estimate the numerical effect of radiative corrections one has to take into account concrete experimental conditions .",
    "of course , to get the final answer one should include the corrections into the whole program of the data analysis .",
    "but our task here will be just to present analytic results with simple estimates of their impact .",
    "so we will simplify the set - up ( still following the main features of the experiment ) : +  we assume that the measurement is based on the detection of the final electron energy and momentum , +  the electron is detected `` bare '' , i.e. without possible accompanying photons , +  there is just a simple cut on the lost energy : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a dimensionless parameter , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the typical magnitude of the @xmath12 corrections to the differential cross section is defined by three major factors : ^(1 ) = ~ ( ) . the enhancement by the so called large logarithm @xmath13 and by the logarithm of the cut - off parameter make the size of the one - loop correction to be of the order of a few percent .",
    "since the experimental uncertainties are well below this order , the one - loop corrections were treated in the data analysis with care , see details in  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of our paper is to estimate the leading and next - to - leading higher order corrections .",
    "we will consider one by one the following higher order contributions : + 1 .",
    "higher order effects in vacuum polarization ; + 2 .",
    "cut - off dependence of the photonic corrections ; + 3 .",
    "light pair corrections in the leading logarithmic approximation ; + 4 .",
    "complete next - to - leading @xmath14 corrections to the lepton line .",
    "as can be seen from the first order , higher order corrections only to the electron line and to vacuum polarization can be numerically important .",
    "running of the qed coupling constant can be naturally represented as @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "a discussion of the relative size of different contributions to @xmath17 for low @xmath18 values can be found in ref .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath17 for the range of momentum transfer under consideration is about @xmath19 .",
    "the bulk of the vacuum polarization effect comes from one - loop @xmath20 pair insertion into the photon propagator , & & _",
    "e(q^2 ) = ( l- ) + ( ) ^2(l + & & + ( 3 ) - ) + ( ^3 ) .",
    "one can note that the @xmath21 contribution is of the next - to - leading order , since it contains only the first power of the large logarithm @xmath22 .",
    "so it makes only a @xmath23 effect well below the precision tag .",

    "= ^(0)()^2 = .",
    "polarization of vacuum by virtual @xmath24 pairs is not as large as by the @xmath20 ones .",
    "but in the bulk of the kinematical domain the suppression is only logarithmic .",
    "so , & & _ ( q^2 ) = + & & + , v _ has to be taken into account at least in the first order in @xmath25 . for @xmath26  gev it reaches @xmath27 .    instead of the resummed geometrical series of eq .",

    "@xcite used exponentiation of the effect of the vacuum polarization by leptons , which is close numerically for the given @xmath18 range , see fig .",
    "[ vac_diff ] below .",
    "the hadronic contribution @xmath28 is rather small at @xmath29  gev , but at the right edge it is rising steeply and reaches a few permille . contributions of tau leptons and electroweak bosons are obviously numerically negligible in our case .",
    "more detailed numerical estimates of vacuum polarization effects will be presented below in sect .",
    "[ numres ] .",
    "the yennie - frautschi - suura theorem  @xcite proves that emission of each soft photon can be treated as an independent process . as the result , multiple emission of soft photons",
    "can be resummed into an exponent . by construction in the case of independent emission of soft photons , the maximal energy of each photon",
    "is limited independently .",
    "but in the given experimental set - up , we have a cut - off on the total lost energy",

    "@xcite .",
    "the proper exponentiation of radiative corrections in the leading logarithmic approximation is based on the exact solution of the renormalization group equation , see  @xcite .",
    "but for the practical application under consideration it is sufficient to compute effect order by order and keep the theoretical uncertainty under control in this way .",
    "the contribution of @xmath20 pairs can be easily estimated with the help of the leading logarithmic approximation ( lla ) in qed  @xcite : [ pair_lla ] & _ ^lla = ( l)^2p^(0)_+ ( l)^3 \\{(p^(0)p^(0 ) ) _ + & + p^(0 ) _ } + where the so - called @xmath9-parts of splitting functions ( see e.g. refs .",

    ". the corresponding effect will be estimated below .      in order to control the precision of theoretical estimates we can compute the complete set of next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections to the given process by means of the renormalization group approach to qed  @xcite .",

    "we can follow the paper  @xcite , where nlo qed corrections were computed in a similar set - up for the case of bhabha scattering .",

    "it is natural to choose it to be equal to the momentum transfer : @xmath40 .",
