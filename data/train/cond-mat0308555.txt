    "flory s model of crystallization of semiflexible linear polymers [ 1,2 ] is well known and describes a completely inactive crystal ( cr ) at low temperatures [ 3 ] within the approximations developed independently by flory [ 2 ] , and by huggins [ 4 ] .",
    "there is a first - order melting to a disordered equilibrium liquid ( el ) phase , which has made it an attractive model to justify the kauzmann paradox [ 5 ] and the ideal glass transition [ 6 ] in supercooled liquids ( scl ) [ 5 - 31 ] .",
    "the ideal glass transition in fragile supercooled liquids [ 7,9,17 ] is believed to be a manifestation of a _ rapid drop _ in the ( configurational ) entropy [ 32 ] near the kauzmann temperature _ _",
    "t__@xmath6 , and has been a topic of many recent investigations [ 24 - 31 ] .",
    "the entropy in this work will always refer to the configurational entropy [ 32 ] .",
    "there are competing theories , both for and against an ideal glass transition , and the situation is far from clear [ 7 ] .",
    "even the nature of the melting transition in the flory model is in dispute [ 10 - 13,27 ] , mainly because the gujrati - goldstein excitations [ 3,10,11 ] destroy the complete inactive nature of the crystal phase .",
    "the present work is motivated by this confused state of the field , and provides a convincing argument in favor of an ideal glass transition at a finite non - zero temperature . in order to substantiate our claims",
    ", we need to consider an _ extension _ of the original flory model of melting .",
    "we also clarify the nature of the melting transition in the flory model [ 10,11,13,27 ] .",
    "our conclusions are based on exact calculations .",
    "some of the preliminary results have appeared earlier [ 28 ] .",
    "the present work provides the missing details in ref .",
    "according to the paradox _ _ , _ _ originally introduced by kauzmann [ 5 ] , the extrapolated entropy _ _ s__@xmath7(_t _ ) of the supercooled liquid becomes less than the entropy _",
    "_ s__@xmath8(_t _ ) of the corresponding cr at temperatures below the glass transition temperature _ _ t__@xmath9 .",
    "it is a common belief [ 5 - 7,14,15 ] that the entropy of scl _ can not _ be less than the entropy of cr .",
    "however , it is worth noting [ 7,28,31 ] that there is no thermodynamic requirement for or against this .",
    "it also does not violate the third law of thermodynamics .",
    "however , treating this possibility as a paradox , now conventionally known as the _ kauzmann _ _ paradox _ or _ catastrophe _ , kauzmann suggested that the system would either crystallize spontaneously [ 5 ] or undergo an ideal glass transition [ 5 - 10,17 ] to avoid the paradox .",
    "the existence of a glass transition caused by the above paradox has been originally justified [ 8 ] only in the flory model of melting applied to linear polymers that are long .",
    "the approximate calculation [ 8 ] shows that the cr  phase is completely inactive ( zero specific heat , and zero entropy ) .",
    "the supercooled liquid avoids the kauzmann catastrophe by undergoing a continuous transition called the ideal glass transition .",
    "this pivotal work enshrined the kauzmann catastrophe as probably the most important mechanism behind the glass transition .",
    "it should be stressed that the glass transition is ubiquitous and is also seen in small molecules .",
    "_ however , no model calculation exists that demonstrates the paradox for small molecules .",
    "_ unfortunately , the approximations used by gibbs and dimarzio [ 8 ] have subsequently been rigorously proven to be incorrect , and unreliable [ 10 - 13 ] , casting doubts on their primary conclusion of the existence of the kauzmann paradox .",
    "thus , there is currently no justification for the paradox as the root cause for the ideal glass transition , at least in long polymers .",
    "the current work is motivated by a desire to see if we can , nevertheless , justify a thermodynamic basis of the ideal glass transition in very long linear polymers . to this end",
    ", we perform an exact calculation .",
    "we should point out that recently we have discovered the existence of an ideal glass transition in a model of simple fluids [ 31(a ) ] and of dimers [ 31(b ) ] .",
    "however , this work deals only with long polymers . as discussed elsewhere",
    "[ 28 , 31 ] , the ideal glass transition in our view comes about not due to the originally proposed kauzmann paradox caused by _ _",
    "s__@xmath7(_t _ ) @xmath10__s__@xmath11(_t _ ) , but because of the _ entropy crisis _ when the entropy of the state becomes _",
    "a negative entropy implies that there _ can not _ be any realizable configuration of the system , which is impossible as there must be at least one configuration for the system to exist in nature .",
    "thus , in the following , we interpret the kauzmann paradox not in the original sense , but in the sense of the above entropy crisis .    in the flory model , a polymer chain is assumed to consist of @xmath12equal segments , each with the same size as the solvent molecule .",
    "each site of the lattice is occupied by either a polymer segment or a solvent molecule , and the excluded volume effects are taken into account by requiring a site to be occupied only once , either by a solvent molecule or a polymer segment .",
    "we can also think of the solvent as representing voids in the system .",
    "the polymer chain occupies a contiguous sequence of all the lattice sites connected by polymer bonds . for concreteness and ease of discussion , we take the lattice to be a square lattice , which approximates a tetrahedral lattice on which the model is supposed to be defined .",
    "both lattices have the same coordination number @xmath13=4 . at every site",
    ", the polymer chain can assume either a trans conformation ( the conformation is related to the state of two consecutive bonds ) , when the consecutive bonds are collinear , or one of the two possible gauche conformations , when the polymer chain bends . for a semiflexible polymer chain , every gauche conformation has an energy penalty @xmath0compared to a trans conformation .",
    "we set the energy for a trans conformation to be zero .",
    "the total energy of the system in a configuration on a lattice of @xmath14 sites is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of gauche conformations present in the configuration of the system .",
    "this interaction involves three consecutive molecules of the chain and is the only one considered in the flory model .",
    "no interaction between non - consecutive portions of the same polymer chain or between different polymer chains is taken into account in the flory model since , according to flory [ 2 ] , the crystallization of polymers is not due to intermolecular interactions but due to internal ordering / disordering and excluded volume interactions .",
    "both the flory [ 2 ] and the huggins [ 4 ] approximations predict that the ( configurational ) entropy _ s_(_g _ ) of the polymer chain for a given fraction @xmath17 of gauche bonds goes to zero at a critical value @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is 0.45 in the flory approximation [ 2,10(a ) ] and 0.227 in the huggins approximation [ 4,10(b ) ] ) .",
    "correspondingly , the predicted entropy of the system is zero for any @xmath20 and gives rise to the inactive phase for @xmath20 .",
    "the result of the calculation is shown schematically in fig .",
    "the system is in a disordered liquid phase el at temperatures higher than the melting temperature _ _ t__@xmath21 ( curve bm ) . at _ _",
    "t__@xmath21 , the system undergoes a first order transition to a completely inactive ordered cr , characterized by a zero free energy and a zero density _",
    "( portion mo ) .",
    "there is a discontinuity in _",
    "g _ at _ _ t__@xmath21 .",
    "the results due to flory and huggins are qualitatively similar ; the main difference is that flory s estimate of _ _",
    "t__@xmath21 is about four times higher than that due to huggins [ 10(b ) ] .",
    "however , the simulations [ 12,27 ] strongly support the presence of the gujrati - goldstein excitations that destroy the inactive crystal at low temperatures , but the nature of the melting transition remains uncertain , which makes the mathematical extrapolation ma representing the supercooled liquid [ 8 ] questionable . in particular , it is not clear if the extrapolation of the exact result would give a non - zero temperature where @xmath22 would go to zero but where @xmath23 .",
    "[ ptb ]        rigorous lower bounds on @xmath24 per particle ( and hence upper bounds for the free energy ) as a function of @xmath25 have been obtained [ 10,11 ] .",
    "gujrati and goldstein were able to prove that the entropy per segment of the chain in the case of a single polymer chain that occupies all the sites of the lattice ( the hamilton walk limit ) satisfies @xmath26 hence , _ s _",
    "is positive for any value of _ g _ @xmath270 , as it surely must be , in contrast with the results obtained by flory .",
    "bounds are also available for the case of finite - length polymers [ 11 ] .",
    "the above bound ( 2 ) implies that the equilibrium free energy of the system is never zero for @xmath28 , see curve ( b ) in fig . 1 , and that the system is never completely ordered at any finite temperature .",
    "while the results due to gujrati and goldstein clearly show that the approximations of flory and huggins do not give a satisfactory description of the system , they just provide an upper bound for the equilibrium free energy of the system ; nothing is known about the correct equilibrium entropy .",
    "therefore , it is still unknown what the actual behavior of the free energy is , which is needed to obtain the continuation of the scl liquid phase .",
    "the bounds do not say anything about the extrapolated ( i.e. continued ) scl free energy or entropy .",
    "the knowledge of the reliable free energy form is fundamental in order to understand if there is a phase transition of any kind in the system at any finite temperature . in particular , it is not clear if the model has a first - order melting transition .",
    "it should be recalled that one can usually continue the free energy only past a first - order transition , and not a second order transition due to the singularity in the latter case .",
    "if there is no melting transition with a latent heat , then there may be no scl liquid below the melting transition . in this case",
    ", there would be no validity to the gibbs - dimarzio conjecture of a  glass transition in the scl liquid .",
    "thus , an exact calculation is highly desirable .    in recent years",
    ", the study of the glass transition has been stimulated by the development of the mode - coupling theory ( mct ) [ 20 - 22 ] .",
    "this theory was developed in the first place for simple liquids but has been applied to polymers also [ 20 ]",
    ". the mct studies the evolution of the density autocorrelation function that can be measured in scattering experiments or calculated in computer simulations and is , therefore , of practical interest .",
    "the main result of this theory is the prediction of a critical temperature _ _",
    "t__@xmath29 , above the glass transition temperature , corresponding to a crossover in the dynamics of the system . at _ _",
    "t__@xmath29 , the correlation time of the system ( the segmental relaxation time in the case of a polymeric glass ) diverges with a power law just as one observes near a critical point : @xmath30    many neutron and light scattering experiments [ 20 ] have shown that the mct is able to predict at least qualitatively the spectra of low molecular weight materials .",
    "most of the systems for which mct gives a good description of the dynamics ( at least qualitatively ) belong to the class of fragile glass formers .",
    "the theory has not been tested extensively with polymers that have large molecular weight but at the same time have been shown to be the most fragile systems yet identified [ 21 - 23 ] .",
    "recent activities [ 24 - 26 ] have tried to export the progresses made in the field of spin glasses [ 33 ] to the field of real glasses . even though the replica trick is clearly unphysical [ 34,35 ] , this approach has been extended to the case of real glasses .",
    "the replica approach has been applied to many lennard - jones glasses and the results have been interesting [ 24 - 26 ] .",
    "they provide some justification for the ideal glass transition",
    ". this may also be the case for polymers , which is the focus of this study .    despite the wide interest in the subject",
    ", there is still no comprehensive understanding of the nature of the vitrifying scl and its relationship with cr , the mechanism responsible for the rapid entropy loss near _ _",
    "t__@xmath9 , and the nature of the ideal glass transition .",
    "it would also be interesting to see if there is a possible thermodynamic basis for the critical ( and apparently a mode - coupling ) transition in scl s .    in order to obtain a thermodynamic justification for all these phenomena , we consider in detail in this work a very simple limiting case .",
    "the solvent density will be taken to be identically zero .",
    "thus , we consider an _ incompressible _ pure system .",
    "the effect of free volume is treated in separate publications [ 29 - 31 ] .",
    "we also consider the limiting case of a single chain covering the entire lattice .",
    "such a limit is conventionally known as the hamilton walk limit [ 10,11 ] .",
    "the case of many chains of finite lengths is considered elsewhere [ 29 - 31 ] . to obtain a first order melting",
    ", we have to extend the flory model of melting , as described below .",
    "we have substituted the original square lattice with a husimi cactus ( fig .",
    "2 ) on which the original problem is solved _ exactly_. this is the only _ approximation _ we make .",
    "the results of this calculation for the case of a special interaction have been reported earlier [ 28 ] but details were not given .",
    "the present work also provides the missing details .",
    "the dangling bonds outside it show its connection through surface sites ( not shown in the figure ) with the larger infinite cactus , as explained in the text.,width=480 ]    it has been previously shown [ 36 ] that the exact calculations on recursive structures like the husimi cactus are more reliable than conventional mean - field calculations . in this approach , the problem is solved exactly , taking into account _ all _ correlations present on the recursive lattice . in most cases ,",
    "the real lattice is approximated by a tree structure .",
    "because of the tree nature , the correlations are weak .",
    "we have chosen the husimi cactus , obtained by joining two squares ( fig .",
    "2 ) at each vertex , so that the coordination number @xmath31 . on a square lattice , there are also squares that share a bond .",
    "such squares are not present in the cactus .",
    "thus , the cactus should be thought of representing the _ checkerboard _ version of the square lattice , with the further provision that no closed loops of size larger than the elementary square are present .",
    "the square cactus is chosen to allow for the gujrati - goldstein excitations [ 10,11 ] that are important in disordering the ideal crystal at absolute zero . _ the results from the cactus calculation",
    "can be thought of as representing an approximate theory of the model on a square lattice .",
    "_    the layout of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the lattice model in terms of independent extensive quantities of interest .",
    "it is the most general model provided we restrict these quantities to represent pairs , triplets , and quadruplets of sites within each square .",
    "we also discuss the general physics of the model .",
    "as said above , we use a square lattice for simplicity to introduce the model , even though we eventually consider a husimi cactus , on which the calculations are exactly . in sect .",
    "iii , we explain the recursive solution method on a husimi cactus .",
    "we introduce 1-cycle and 2-cycle solutions , representing the disordered and the ordered phase , respectively .",
    "the results are presented in sect .",
    "iv along with the discussion , and the final section contains our conclusions .",
    "we consider a square lattice of @xmath14 sites to focus our attention . we will neglect surface effects .",
    "there are @xmath322@xmath14 lattice bonds , or distinct pairs of sites .",
    "let us describe the state of a square by the number of polymer bonds @xmath33 in it .",
    "the bonds in the following refer to the polymer bonds .",
    "let @xmath34 , and @xmath35 denote the number of squares ( s ) with @xmath36 , and 1 , respectively ; see fig .",
    "[ tb ]        for @xmath37 , we distinguish between the case of parallel bonds ( p ) , with the number of such squares @xmath38 , and gauche ( g ) bonds , with the number of such squares @xmath39 .",
    "the hairpin ( h ) turn corresponds to @xmath40 , with the number of such squares @xmath41 .",
    "no square is allowed to have four bonds in it .",
    "let @xmath42 and @xmath43 denote the number of trans and gauche bonds , respectively , and @xmath44 and @xmath45  the number of pairs of parallel bonds and hairpin turns , respectively , in a given configuration .",
    "we will also use them to represent their average values , as there will be no confusion .",
    "it is easily seen that the number of squares on a square lattice is @xmath46 .",
    "let @xmath47 denote the number of polymer bonds , and @xmath48 the number of unbonded monomer - monomer contacts .",
    "the following topological identities are easily seen to hold : @xmath49@xmath50@xmath51@xmath52@xmath53    as said earlier , the cactus represents the _ checkerboard _ version of the square lattice , so that the number of squares @xmath54 on both lattices with the same number of sites @xmath14 are not the same ; see sect .",
    "iii also . for a square lattice , @xmath54= @xmath14 ;",
    "for the cactus , @xmath55 = @xmath56 .",
    "however , the number of lattice bonds @xmath57 on both lattices are the same .",
    "because of this , eq . ( 6 ) must be modified for the cactus .",
    "since each bond belongs to only one square in the cactus , we have : @xmath58 all other identities remain valid on the cactus .      among the eleven extensive quantities ,",
    "@xmath14 , @xmath47 , @xmath43 , @xmath42 , @xmath48 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath59 and @xmath41 , there are six independent geometrical relations ; the second one in ( 7 ) is not independent .",
    "in addition , for the hamilton walk problem , we have @xmath60 .",
    "thus , there are only four independent extensive quantities , which we take to be @xmath14 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 . one of these , the lattice size @xmath14 , will be used to define the partition function .",
    "the remaining three independent quantities @xmath44 , @xmath43 and @xmath45  will be then used to define the configuration uniquely .",
    "corresponding to each of the quantities @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , there is an independent activity @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively , that will determine the partition function for the hamilton walk problem as @xmath64 where the sum is over _ distinct configurations _ obtained by all possible values of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath65  consistent with a fixed lattice size @xmath14 .",
    "the activities @xmath61 , @xmath66 and @xmath63  are determined by the three - site bending penalty @xmath0  introduced by flory in his model , an energy of interaction @xmath1 associated with each parallel pair of neighboring bonds , and an energy @xmath2  for each hairpin turn within each square as follows : @xmath67 here , @xmath68 is the inverse temperature _",
    "t _ in the units of the boltzmann constant .",
    "the original flory model is obtained when the last two interactions are absent .",
    "it should be stressed that @xmath2 is the excess energy associated to the configuration , once the energy of the two bends and the pair of parallel bonds have been subtracted out .",
    "both @xmath1 and @xmath2  are associated with four - site interactions , since it is necessary to determine the state of four adjacent sites to determine if a pair of parallel bonds or a hairpin turn is present .",
    "the model is easily generalized to include free volume by introducing voids , each of which occupies a site of the lattice .",
    "the number of voids @xmath69 is controlled by the void activity @xmath70 .",
    "the number @xmath71 of polymers is controlled by another activity given by @xmath72 the interaction between nearest neighbor pairs @xmath73 of voids and the monomers of the polymers determines the boltzmann weight @xmath74 .",
    "the partition function of the extended model is given by @xmath75 where the sum is over distinct configurations consistent with the fixed lattice of @xmath14 sites . because the activity @xmath76 only determines the average number of linear polymers , but not their individual sizes , the model in eq .",
    "( 9b ) describes polydisperse polymers [ 37 ] , each of which must contain at least one bond .",
    "we now turn to our simplified model of the hamilton walk ( @xmath77 , and @xmath78 ) . in this model ,",
    "the energy of interaction in a given configuration is given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "the parameters can in principle assume positive and negative values .",
    "however , we will restrict ourselves to @xmath82 in this work .",
    "the limit @xmath83 corresponds to a completely _ flexible _ polymer problem , which is of no interest to us here , as it corresponds to the infinite temperature limit of our model .",
    "the limit , however , is of considerable interest in the study of protein folding and has been investigated by several workers [ 38 ] .",
    "in addition , we will focus mainly on the case @xmath84 .",
    "a positive @xmath85  guarantees that parallel bond energy opposes the creation of configurations in which pairs of parallel bonds are present and @xmath86 makes the penalty for a pair of parallel bonds less than that for a gauche conformation .",
    "this guarantees the presence of a crystalline phase at low temperatures , as shown below .",
    "the physics of the model at absolute zero can be easily understood on general grounds .",
    "we are interested in the thermodynamic limit @xmath88 .",
    "we first consider @xmath89 . for @xmath86 , the ground state at @xmath90",
    "has @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , as shown in fig .",
    "( the labels r and l are related to the state of the sites as introduced in the next section . )",
    "thus , @xmath94 .",
    "this is what we will call the perfect crystal at absolute zero . for @xmath95 , the state in fig .",
    "4(a ) remains the ground state as long as @xmath96 .",
    "this condition ensures that hairpin turns are not present . for @xmath97 , and @xmath89 , the ground state at @xmath90 has @xmath98 , @xmath99 , as shown in fig .",
    "thus , @xmath100 .",
    "this remains the ground state provided @xmath101 , which ensures that the hairpin turns are not present . since our interest is to have a crystal state as the equilibrium state at low temperatures , we would only consider the earlier case @xmath86 , with @xmath96 .",
    "[ tb ]    : ( a ) crystalline phase with @xmath102 and @xmath92 ; ( b ) step - like configuration with @xmath99 and @xmath98 .",
    "see text for the explanation of the symbols.,width=480 ]    it should be recognized that the model considered here is defined on a lattice .",
    "thus , the ground state also possesses the symmetry of the lattice .",
    "this symmetry is imposed by the lattice symmetry and is independent of the model .",
    "thus , this induced symmetry should not be confused with the point group symmetry of a real crystal , which is brought about by the interactions in the system .",
    "the symmetry in our model is due to the orientational order between pairs of parallel bonds .",
    "it is because of the orientational order defining the crystal in our model that we can obtain a continuous transition between the crystal  and the equilibrium liquid .",
    "the lack of a point group symmetry of a real crystal in our model should not be a taken as a serious limitation of the model , since our main goal is to study the possibility of a glass transition in a supercooled liquid .",
    "the determination of the supercooled liquid branch requires the continuation past a first - order melting transition .",
    "thus , the exact nature of the symmetry of the cr phase is not as important as the existence of a discontinuous melting .",
    "the husimi cactus approximates the square lattice , as said above .",
    "both have the coordination number @xmath31 , and the elemental squares as the smallest loop .",
    "however , the most important reason for choosing the square cactus is that it allows for hairpin turns that give rise to the gujrati - goldstein excitation in the flory model of melting .",
    "a bethe lattice would be inappropriate for this reason . as said above",
    ", the number of squares on the cactus is half of that on a square lattice with the same number of sites @xmath14 .",
    "this can also be easily seen as follows by assuming homogeneity of the lattice .",
    "first , consider the square lattice .",
    "four squares meet at each site ; however , each square will be counted four times , due to its four corners , assuming homogeneity .",
    "thus , @xmath46 . on a cactus ,",
    "only two squares meet , but each one is counted four times as before .",
    "hence , @xmath103 . despite this , @xmath104 on both lattices",
    ", only half of which are going to be taken up by the hamilton walk on both lattices .",
    "a site is shared by four bonds and two squares @xmath105 , and @xmath106 that are across from each other on the cactus . on the other hand , there are two different pairs of such squares on a square lattice . in a formal sense",
    ", we can imagine that each end of a bond contributes @xmath107  of a site , and each corner of a square contributes @xmath108 of a site ( on a square lattice each corner contributes @xmath107 of a site . ) .",
    "this formal picture will be useful in determining the nature of a homogeneous cactus . to make the cactus homogeneous",
    ", we must consider it to be part of a larger cactus .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "2 , where we show a cactus of generation @xmath109 with dangling bonds ( each one ending with a surface site , not shown in the figure ) outside it to show its connection with the larger infinite cactus .",
    "the latter has no boundary .",
    "a similar homogeneity hypothesis associated with a bethe lattice has been discussed in ref .",
    "37(b ) to which we refer the reader for further details . on a bethe lattice ,",
    "each dangling bond was treated as a half - bond to ensure that @xmath110 , where @xmath13 is the coordination number of the bethe lattice . for the case of the cactus",
    ", we treat each pair of dangling bonds in fig .",
    "2 as a half - square , and each surface site as a half - site to calculate the number of sites @xmath111 , and the number of squares @xmath112 for a cactus of @xmath113 generations .",
    "a trivial calculation shows that @xmath114 so that @xmath115 , as @xmath116 .",
    "since each square contributes 4 bonds , it is also evident that  @xmath104 in the limit of an infinite cactus .",
    "a detailed calculation of the quantities introduced above is given in the appendix .",
    "because of the above - mentioned homogeneity , a site is arbitrarily designated as the origin of the cactus .",
    "each square has one site , called the base site , closer to the origin .",
    "the base site is given an index @xmath117 , the two sites next to the base site within the square , called the intermediate sites , the index @xmath118 , and the remaining fourth site , called the peak site , the index @xmath119 .",
    "we will call this square an @xmath120th level square ; it has its base at the @xmath120th level and its peak at the @xmath119th level ; see fig .",
    "the two lower bonds in the @xmath120th square connected to the @xmath120th site are called the lower bonds and the two upper bonds connected to the peak site are called the upper bonds .",
    "the origin of the lattice is labeled as the @xmath121 level and the level index @xmath120 increases as we move outwards from the origin .",
    "we can imagine cutting the husimi tree at an @xmath120th site into two parts , one of which does not contain the origin if @xmath122 .",
    "we call this the @xmath113th branch of the lattice and denote it by @xmath123 . at the origin , we get two identical branches each containing the origin . we will call each of those the @xmath124th branch .",
    "[ tb ]    th level of the lattice.,width=288 ]    we only consider parallel bonds and hairpin turns that are inside the squares , since the cactus represents the checkerboard version of the square lattice .",
    "thus , each square can contribute only once to either @xmath125 , or @xmath126this means that @xmath127 in the perfect crystal at absolute zero .",
    "similarly , it can be easily seen that the maximum possible value of @xmath128is @xmath129 .",
    "we consider a linear polymer that covers all the sites of the husimi cactus or the square .",
    "its configuration determines the state of the bonds in each square .",
    "consider a pair of two squares @xmath105 , and @xmath130that are across from each other .",

    "when @xmath85 is negative ( corresponding to a negative four - site interaction energy @xmath286 ) the temperature @xmath228 at which the el appears moves to higher values . since the temperature @xmath287 at which cr appears is unaffected by the choice of the value of @xmath85 , a shift of the origin of the el phase to higher temperatures makes ml the _ equilibrium phase _ for temperatures between @xmath3  and @xmath288 ; it is no longer a metastable phase in this range@xmath289 we identify the equilibrium portion of the ml phase as a new equilibrium phase , and denote it by el@xmath290 ; the subscript is a reminder that the phase is associated with the ml phase .",

    "it can be observed that the discontinuity in the specific heat at @xmath228 is a function of the parameters @xmath85 and @xmath227 . in particular ,",
    "if we fix @xmath227 , as @xmath85 increases the discontinuity gets smaller and smaller as long as @xmath85 @xmath100.8 , and then starts growing again while the transition temperature keeps moving to lower values ; the results are not shown .",
    "the crystalline phase is an ordered one but , unlike the ground state predicted by the original flory model [ 1,2 ] ( fig .",
    "1 ) , it has non zero entropy .",
    "it also satisfies the gujrati - goldstein bounds .",
    "the i and o states disappear in the crystalline phase but this phase has non zero entropy because of the many possible configurations that the polymer chain can assume corresponding to different sequences of l and r states .",
    "the entropy of the crystalline phase goes to zero only when the temperature goes to zero , which is consistent with the third law of thermodynamics .",
    "if the cooling process is such that the system can avoid crystallization at @xmath3 , the equilibrium liquid el can be supercooled to give rise to scl that transforms into the metastable liquid ml through a liquid - liquid second - order transition at @xmath293 ( no latent heat is associated with the transition ) .",
    "the metastable liquid and the equilibrium liquid phases are somehow similar .",
    "the metastable liquid consists of a random sequence of r and l states , while the equilibrium liquid consists of a random sequence of r , l , i and o states .",
    "the presence of o and i states makes the total energy and the entropy of the equilibrium liquid larger than those of the metastable liquid , see figs .",
    "10 and 11 .",
    "we tentatively identify the critical temperature @xmath228 of the liquid - liquid transition as the mode - coupling transition temperature  because the transition exhibits some of the features predicted by the original mode coupling theory at the critical mode - coupling transition temperature .",
    "it should be remarked that our equilibrium investigation _ can not _ provide any direct information about the dynamics at @xmath228 except by inference .",
    "hence , the connection we allude to above should only be taken as tentative , in view of the fact that the mode - coupling transition , applied successfully to simple fluids , is considered to be a dynamic transition .",
    "we can only add that the mode - coupling theory is not well - understood for long polymers , and it is not clear what its predictions might be for infinite polymers that we are investigating here .    according to this theory",
    ", the dynamics slows down according to eq .",
    "( 3 ) near @xmath294 the local molecular structure freezes and only long - time cooperative jumps are allowed below this temperature .",
    "thus , the dynamic transition is between two disordered states , very much like the thermodynamic liquid - liquid transition we observe in our calculation .",
    "let us consider the behavior of the correlation length @xmath295 of the system near the critical temperature @xmath228 .",
    "as @xmath228  is approached from above @xmath296 the correlation length @xmath295 of the supercooled liquid must diverge to infinity because the transition is continuous .",
    "it is very easy to observe from the results that there is a _ discontinuity _ in the specific heat of the system at the transition from the supercooled liquid to the metastable liquid .",
    "indeed , the scl terminates at @xmath228 as @xmath297 the disappearance of scl is what gives rise to this divergence , which will contribute to the critical slowing down of the system .",
    "such a critical slowing down is exhibited at the mode - coupling transition [ 39 ] ; see eq .",
    "( 3 ) .    on the other hand",
    ", ml exists at all temperatures .",
    "thus , there would be _ no _ divergence at @xmath228 in the correlation length @xmath298 associated with ml .",
    "indeed , its specific heat remains continuous .",
    "this will imply that the dynamics of the system should not undergo any significant change at the critical temperature @xmath228 if we approach it while heating up ml in such a way that ml is not allowed to turn into scl . in simulation , one can investigate ml by suppressing fast relaxations that are supposed to freeze at the mode - coupling temperature .",
    "such an attempt has already been made [ 25 ] where one sees no anomalous behavior at the mode - coupling temperature .",
    "parisi and coworkers [ 25 ] while analyzing a lennard - jones system have observed this kind of dynamics . in their approach ,",
    "the fast dynamics of the system ( the one pertinent to the supercooled liquid in our model ) is suppressed and only the slow dynamics of the system is taken into account .",
    "the slow dynamics is described as a relaxation process taking place in a connected network of potential energy minima .",
    "indeed , the authors only observes an arrhenius behavior in the relaxation time , as opposed to the vogel - tammann - fulcher behavior associated with the mode - coupling transition .",
    "even though the system studied by parisi and coworkers is very different from the polymer system studied here , it is important to note that all the numerical results obtained in the case of the lennard - jones fluid are in agreement with the experimental findings in non - network forming glasses and especially in glasses that are fragile according to angell s definition [ 40 ] .",
    "recent experimental results obtained by sokolov and coworkers [ 41 ] studying polyisobutylene and polystyrene show the presence of a critical behavior only above @xmath228  along with the failure of the predictions of the mode coupling theory below the critical temperature .",
    "these authors show many similarities between the results obtained on these polymeric glasses and the ideas of the liquid - liquid transition in polymeric liquids formulated by boyer and coworkers [ 42,43 ] .",
    "it is worth noting that this liquid - liquid transition would manifest itself through a discontinuity in the first derivative of the specific heat ( and not the specific heat itself as in the present case ) at the transition temperature .",
    "this makes boyer s result very different from our result .",
    "the idea introduced by boyer has been strongly criticized and is still the subject of discussion [ 44,45 ] .",
    "the second similarity has to do with our choice of the parameter @xmath85 , so that @xmath228 lies above the kauzmann temperature @xmath299 this is also what is expected in the mode - coupling theory in which the transition occurs above the conventional glass transition temperature .",
    "the third similarity appears when we allow free volume in our model in eq .",
    "9(b ) , as has been done recently [ 29 ] .",
    "it is found that the free volume in the model for the case of infinite polymers _ vanishes _ identically at @xmath228 , and remains zero below it .",
    "consequently , one expects the viscosity to diverge at @xmath228 .",
    "while the mode coupling theory describes the transition at @xmath228  as dynamic in nature , our results show that the transition at @xmath228 is thermodynamic in nature .",
    "the sharp transition is due to the polymer being infinitely long , and disappears as soon as polymers become _ finite _ in size [ 29 ] .",
    "however , for polymers of reasonable sizes , there will continue to be a narrow crossover region between two phases ( ml and scl ) .",
    "below @xmath228 , the only two phases that are present are the metastable liquid and the crystal . above @xmath228 , the supercooled liquid , which is",
    "the continuation of the equilibrium liquid above @xmath3 , is more stable than the metastable liquid and coexists with the crystal .",
    "it is worth noting that the modified free energies @xmath300 of both",
    "the metastable liquid and the supercooled liquid cross over and becomes _ positive _ at some finite and non - zero temperature .",
    "let us focus on the metastable liquid as its behavior is easy to describe since its modified free energy @xmath301  remains _ independent _ of@xmath302 and @xmath227 .",
    "we first observe that the 2-cycle fp solution contains within its possible solutions the 1-cycle solution .",
    "we also find that the free energy of all possible 2-cycle solutions ( including the 1-cycle solutions ) at absolute zero are the _ same _ : @xmath303    because of the exact nature of our calculation , this equality of the ml and cr free energies at absolute zero is not brought about due to any approximation . because of this equality at absolute zero , we will now consider the modified free energy @xmath300 in the following .",
    "the cr free energy remains negative at all temperatures and approaches zero at absolute zero .",
    "thus , cr  has non - negative entropy . on the other hand ,",
    "the ml free energy @xmath300 , which is negative at higher temperatures , becomes positive at some intermediate and non - zero temperature @xmath304 and keeps increasing , as the temperature is lowered , until the kauzmann temperature @xmath305 ( @xmath306 in our model ) is reached .",
    "below @xmath305 , the ml  free energy @xmath300  must necessarily decrease since it must vanish at absolute zero .",
    "the maximum of @xmath307 corresponds to the vanishing of the entropy of the ml phase , below which the entropy must become _ negative _ [ 46 ] .",
    "thus , the existence of the kauzmann temperature is a consequence of the fact that the ml  free energy @xmath300 , once it crosses the zero at @xmath308 , must necessarily decrease at some lower temperature so as to return to zero at absolute zero .",
    "the existence of the maximum in @xmath309 as a function of  the temperature is the root of the rapid entropy drop noted by kauzmann [ 5 ] .",
    "the maximum at a positive @xmath305 is forced by thermodynamics since the larger specific heat of ml makes @xmath309 cross over to positive values at @xmath308 . if we had carried out our calculation in some approximation , as is the case with the calculation of gibbs and dimarzio [ 8 ] , we certainly could not draw this remarkable conclusion .",
    "the crystalline phase has an entropy that is never negative .",
    "hence , its entropy is larger than the entropy of the metastable liquid in the temperature interval @xmath311 , where @xmath312  is the temperature at which the entropy of the two phases is the same ( see fig .",
    "10(b ) ) . this result contrasts the common belief [ 17 ] that the entropy of a crystalline phase must always be lower than the entropy of the corresponding liquid phase , even if the latter is an equilibrium phase .",
    "our results clearly show that there is no thermodynamic requirement for this belief to be true . indeed , real systems like he conform with this observation .    in order to sustain the common belief that the entropy of the liquid must always be larger than that of the crystal",
    ", it was conjectured by kauzmann that the system must avoid the ( kauzmann ) catastrophe caused as soon as the requirement @xmath313 is violated .",
    "the system is supposed to avoid the catastrophe by undergoing either a spontaneous crystallization , as proposed by kauzmann in his original paper , or an ideal glass transition [ 5,8,15,47 ] .",
    "the most important result of the present research regarding the kauzmann catastrophe is that since our calculations show that it is possible to observe @xmath314 in an explicit model calculation , the existence of the catastrophe must be reinterpreted in terms of the entropy crisis corresponding to having no realizable state  ( negative entropy ) [ 46 ] : the catastrophe happens at a temperature @xmath305  where the entropy of the metastable liquid goes to zero and not at the temperature @xmath312 at which the entropy of the liquid becomes equal to the entropy of the crystal .",
    "the two temperatures coincide in the original flory model since the entropy of the crystal is identically equal to zero below @xmath3 , see fig . 1 , while in our exact calculation , the two temperatures are different because the entropy of the crystal is zero only when the temperature goes to zero .",
    "the ml free energy has no physical relevance below @xmath305  since it corresponds to negative values of the entropy .",
    "decreasing the temperature as @xmath315 the entropy falls very rapidly to zero ( as seen , for example , in fig . 10 ( b ) ) . as the temperature",
    "is decreased , the energy of the metastable liquid can not increase because this would correspond to a negative specific heat . at the same time , this energy can not decrease since there are no states with non - negative entropy ( except the crystal phase , but we do not consider this possibility here ) available to the system . the only conclusion that can be drawn from these observations is that for @xmath316 , the metastable liquid remains frozen in the state in which it finds itself at @xmath305 .",
    "_ this describes the ideal glass transition_. in our analysis , ml does not undergo any changes in its state at the glass transition , so that this transition can not be a first - order transition as recently proposed by parisi and coworkers [ 26(b ) ] .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the energy of the metastable liquid increases monotonically with @xmath222 and is very similar to the excitation profiles for other systems like the mixed lennard - jones system [ 48 ] and the two states model [ 49 ] .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that our model predicts , at the kauzmann temperature , an upward discontinuity for the specific heat .",
    "the specific heat of the metastable liquid is decreasing with the temperature for @xmath317 .",
    "this kind of behavior is in disagreement with many experimental results but has been observed in computer simulations by parisi and coworkers [ 26 ] and experimentally ( at least in some temperature interval immediately above the glass transition ) in glasses formed by low molecular weight materials of very different nature like 1-butene [ 45 ] and the metallic system au - si [ 40 ] .",
    "the value @xmath318 corresponds to a borderline case . as we have shown in fig .",

    "we also find that , if we keep @xmath227 fixed , then as the value of @xmath85 increases , the values of @xmath3  and @xmath228  decrease and , as said above , for @xmath320 , the supercooled liquid shows its own kauzmann temperature corresponding to the maximum in its free energy . if @xmath85 becomes negative , the critical temperature moves to higher temperatures .",

    "it is evidently given by : @xmath340 so that the total number of sites belonging to the first @xmath120 generations ( and excluding the origin ) of a rooted tree is : @xmath341 the total number of sites belonging to the first @xmath120 generations of the complete tree is then equal to twice the total number of sites belonging to the first @xmath120 generations of a rooted tree plus one since we have to consider the origin too : @xmath342    let us consider now the number @xmath343 of the@xmath344th generation squares ( @xmath117 ) of the rooted tree .",
    "clearly we have : @xmath345 the total number of squares belonging to the first @xmath120 generations of a rooted tree ( so that the maximum generation of the squares is @xmath346 ) is : @xmath347 the total number of squares belonging to the first @xmath120 generations of the complete tree is then just twice the total number of squares belonging to the first @xmath120 generations of a rooted tree : @xmath348    in order to make the cactus homogeneous , we must consider it to be part of a larger cactus . consequently , both @xmath349 and @xmath350 must be modified in order to take into account the presence of dangling bonds at surface sites : we consider to add half a square to each surface site . recalling that each square contains four half - sites ( a site is shared by two squares ) ,",
    "we conclude that each square contributes two sites to the number of sites .",
    "hence , each half - square contributes one site to the site count .",
    "thus , we modify @xmath350 by adding 1 site for each surface square . this gives for the total number of sites @xmath351      now , if we consider the thermodynamic limit in which @xmath116 we have : @xmath354 which is consistent with our earlier homogeneous hypothesis @xmath355  relating the total number of squares @xmath54 and the total number of sites @xmath14 .",
    "let us finally consider the total number @xmath356 of bonds in the first @xmath120 generations ( @xmath122 )  of the tree .",
    "each square contains four bonds , and there are @xmath349 squares in this tree . thus @xmath357 the modification of the lattice introduced above implies that we must now add half - square at each of the surface sites of the @xmath120th generations ( @xmath122 ) tree .",
    "each half - square contributes 2 bonds .",
    "hence @xmath358 if we consider the thermodynamic limit in which @xmath116 we have : @xmath359 as expected .                                                                  in classical statistical mechanics , which is what is conventionally used to analyze metastability , the contribution @xmath360 to the total entropy @xmath361 from the translational degrees of freedom",
    "is the same for various possible phases like scl or cr that can exist at a given temperature , and is a function only of the temperature @xmath222 .",
    "this is because the kinetic energy is decoupled from the interaction energy in classical mechanics , making the translational degrees of freedom decouple from the rest [ 31(a ) ] .",
    "thus , the translational degrees of freedom do not have to be considered in the investigation .",
    "the difference @xmath362 can be equally well used to characterize various phases of the system ; it is known as the _ configurational entropy _ of the system and determines the configurational partition function . in lattice models like the one considered here",
    ", we do not have the translational degrees of freedom , and the translational entropy is zero .",
    "hence , there is no distinction between the total entropy @xmath361  and the configurational entropy @xmath363  in lattice models .",
    "for this reason , we will not use the subscript ",
    "conf  to denote the configurational entropy in this work .",
    "see for example , h. w. blote and b. nienhuis , phys .",
    "lett . * 72 * , 1372 ( 1994 ) ; m. t. batchelor , j. suzuki , and c. m. yung , phys .",
    "lett . * 73 * , 2646 ( 1994 ) ; j. kondev and j. l. jacobsen , phys .",
    "* 81 * , 2922 ( 1998 ) .",
    "it should be stressed at this point that the existence of a negative entropy in our exact calculation is caused by the use of the continuation and/or the use of solutions that are not the equilibrium one , i.e. solutions that do not have the lowest possible free energy @xmath364 recall that the exact calculation of the free energy through the use of the partition function only requires that the free energy have the correct convexity property , which in this case corresponds to having a non - negative specific heat .",
    "this remains true of all states in our calculation , equilibrium or not .",
    "the requirement that the entropy be non - negative is an additional postulate , justified by the obvious fact that the number of _ realizable _ configurations be _ at least _",
    "the continuation need not satisfy the entropy requirement , the latter being completely independent of the convexity property of the free energy .",
    "there will never be a negative - entropy _ equilibrium _ solution in any exact calculation , as the equilibrium state must correspond to a number of realizable configurations .",
    "this also means that if there is no phase transition in a model , there will be no possibility of any continuation that can then violate the entropy requirement . in this case , there _ can not _ exist any kauzmann temperature ."
