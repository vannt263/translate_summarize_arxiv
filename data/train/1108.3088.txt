    "they conclude that hcn is a much better tracer of sf than co , and in fact they find that the hcn line luminosity scales linearly with the sf rate in galaxies .",
    "hcn exhibits a large electric dipole moment and the molecule is only excited when the gas is sufficiently dense ( @xmath36(h@xmath37 ) @xmath38 10@xmath39@xmath32 ) .",

    "since the energy separation between the individual inversion doublets is only a weak function of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , a vast range of excitation properties can be covered by observations of lines closely spaced in frequency .",
    "the most relevant nh@xmath40 lines fall in the 1.2 cm band ( @xmath44ghz ) .",
    "relative calibration of these lines tends to be very good since they can be observed nearly simultaneously , under similar atmospheric conditions , and with the same telescope , receiver , and backend .",
    "nh@xmath0  has been detected in arp220 by @xcite with the 45 m nobeyama single dish telescope .",
    "their main result was that the ammonia has linewidths of @xmath8 km  s@xmath7 , which they suggest could indicate that the gas is located in an accretion disk around an active nucleus .",
    "alternatively , the wide lines may indicate strong molecular inflows or outflows .",
    "single dish observations , however , can be affected by instabilities that lead to poor spectral baselines and uncertain line profiles .",
    "this is particularly the case for broad lines .",
    "here , we present atca interferometric data with higher signal to noise and better spectral baselines .",
    "we also present a sensitive gbt spectrum . in sect.[sec : obs ] we describe our observational setups .",
    "we present our results in sect.[sec : results ] , along with a critical comparison of our data with those of @xcite . in sect.[sec : discuss ] we derive and interpret the apparent optical depths , gas temperatures , gas densities and kinematics of arp220 , as well as its sf properties .",
    "sect.[sec : summary ] summarizes our paper .",
    "we observed the spectral lines of ammonia and the 1.2 cm ( k - band ) continuum toward arp220 with the atca .",
    "the data were taken in several stages : ( 1 ) a broadband spectrum was obtained covering the 23.2 - 23.6ghz frequency range . at the time of the observations ( 2005 july ) , the atca could not cover this full frequency range in a single observation .",
    "therefore , we configured the observations with 128mhz bands of 64 channels each , and stepped through the desired frequency range in 60mhz increments ( indicated by the bars at the bottom of fig.[fig : atcabroad ] ) , with two bands observed at a time .",
    "the observations were performed over 4 days with @xmath45h on - source per day .",
    "the spectral resolution is equivalent to 2.2 channels ( @xmath46 km  s@xmath7 ) .",
    "calibration was performed individually for each frequency band and observing day . at the time , the atca was in its most compact h75 antenna configuration , where baselines reach from 31 m to 89 m .",
    "( 2 ) the ( 6,6 ) line was observed in 2005 march with the h214 antenna configuration , which has 82m-247 m baselines .",
    "the integration times on source were @xmath30h ( 2005 march 17 ) , and @xmath45h ( 2005 march 20 ) .",
    "( 3 ) on 2005 july 30 we observed the ( 4,4 ) line on source for 4.5h in the h75 configuration .",
    "( 4 ) a day later we measured the ( 5,5 ) line with the same integration time in the same array configuration .",
    "the correlator settings for stages ( 2)-(4 ) were the same as in stage ( 1 ) , except that , for the ( 4,4 ) and ( 5,5 ) transitions , only two 128mhz wide frequency settings were used in parallel and separated by 72mhz .",
    "the ( 6,6 ) line was observed in a single frequency window .",
    "a summary of the observational setups is provided in table[tab : obs ] .",
    "the data were processed using the miriad software package .",
    "we observed pks1253055 for bandpass calibration , pks1934638 for flux calibration , and pks1538 + 149 ( in 20min intervals ) for phase / gain calibration . for each spectrum",
    ", we subtracted the continuum as determined by a linear fit to the line - free channels . in the process we also created continuum data sets .",
    "all data were fourier transformed using ` natural ' weighting . to obtain the spectra",
    ", the data were not deconvolved due to the lack of spatial structure on the scales of the dirty beam ( source size @xmath47 versus @xmath48 beam size , the latter depending on the array configuration , see table[tab : obs ] ) .",
    "deconvolution with clean is only needed to reconstruct source morphologies .",
    "this , however , comes for the prize of introducing non - linearities . for our unresolved source ,",
    "we decided not to clean the data .",
    "given the relatively strong continuum flux , this implies that the noise within the planes of the dirty images is dominated by sidelobes and we measure @xmath49mjybeam@xmath7 depending on the observations . for an estimate of the more representative statistical noise and thus for the apparent optical depth uncertainty",
    ", however , we did apply clean deconvolution to remove the sidelobes .",
    "this method yields rms values of @xmath50mjybeam@xmath7 per channel for the different observations .",
    "we estimate the absolute calibration uncertainties to be of order 15% .",
    "we also observed the 1.2 cm ammonia spectrum toward arp220 on 2006 january 21 and 2006 february 02 with the green bank telescope ( gbt ) of the national radio astronomy observatory ( see table[tab : obs ] ) .",
    "we observed both circular polarizations simultaneously using a total - power nodding mode in which the target position was placed alternately every 2.5min in one of the two beams of the @xmath51ghz k - band receiver .",
    "the beams are spaced by 3  in the cross - elevation direction .",
    "total time on source was 40 minutes .",
    "we configured the spectrometer with an 800mhz spectral window centered on the nh@xmath0(3,3 ) line for arp220 .",
    "the data were calibrated and averaged in gbtidl . during calibration",
    ", we used an estimate of the atmospheric opacity obtained from weather conditions .",
    "we boxcar averaged the spectrum to achieve 1.56mhz channel spacing , and subtracted a fifth - order polynomial fit to the line - free channels over the full 800mhz , a conservative approach for broadband gbt data .",
    "finally we combined the spectra from the two days and the rms noise of the final data is @xmath52mjy per @xmath53mhz channel .",
    "with the atca , we detect an unresolved continuum source toward arp220 at ra(j2000 ) = @xmath54 , dec(j2000 ) = @xmath55 .",
    "the source has a flux density at 23.4ghz of 208mk or @xmath56mjy ( error of order 15% ) measured within the @xmath57 beam . from march to august 2005 , the measured continuum flux varied by less than 5% .      in figs.[fig",
    ": atcabroad ] and [ fig : spec ] we show atca spectra of arp220 in units of apparent optical depth ( see sect.[sec : tau ] ) , and fig.[fig : gbtspec ] shows a gbt spectrum overlaid on the atca data .",
    "all six observed ammonia inversion lines , nh@xmath40 ( @xmath42,@xmath43 ) = ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) , ( 3,3 ) , ( 4,4 ) , ( 5,5 ) , and ( 6,6 ) , are detected in absorption against the radio continuum of arp220 .",
    "we do not detect clear emission features , but the broadband atca spectrum displays slightly positive values adjacent to the ( 1,1 ) absorption line ( see sects.[sec : tau ] and [ sec : t ] for a discussion ) .",
    "we fitted single - component gaussian profiles to all observed absorption lines .",
    "the resulting apparent optical depths @xmath58 ( see sec.[sec : tau ] for their derivation ) , the optical , barycentric peak velocities @xmath59 , the linewidths @xmath60 , and the apparent optical depths integrated over the line profiles , @xmath61d@xmath62 , are given in table[tab : line ] and the fits are shown in fig[fig : spec ] .",
    "the fitted line centroids are all within @xmath63 km  s@xmath7  of the systemic velocity of @xmath64 km  s@xmath7  ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "this is remarkable given the @xmath66 km  s@xmath7  velocity resolution of the atca observations ( see sect.[sec : obs ] ) .",
    "the linewidths range between @xmath67 km  s@xmath7  and @xmath68 km  s@xmath7  for most lines .",
    "the ( 1,1 ) and ( 3,3 ) lines , however , have widths of @xmath69 km  s@xmath7  and @xmath70 km  s@xmath7 , more extreme than the other transitions .",
    "note , though , that the ( 3,3 ) line slightly overlaps with another absorption feature , described in sect.[sec : resultsoh ] .",
    "our fitted linewidths are in agreement with those found for other molecular tracers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but contradict the results presented in @xcite for the nh@xmath0(1,1 ) and ( 3,3 ) lines",
    ". we can not confirm the extremely wide lines of up to @xmath8 km  s@xmath7  observed by @xcite with the nobeyama 45 m telescope .",
    "none of the lines measured with the atca or gbt have widths exceeding @xmath71 km  s@xmath7(see table[tab : line ] and figs.[fig : atcabroad][fig : gbtspec ] ) .",
    "there are some notable differences in widths and strengths of the lines measured with the gbt and the atca",
    ". the reason may be the weakness of the lines , the complexity of the spectra , and potential confusion with the continuum emission from arp220 .",
    "the nh@xmath0(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines are separated by less than 30mhz so , for the gbt data , it is difficult to precisely define a spectral baseline near these features .",
    "the quality of spectral baselines from the interferometric atca data , on the other hand , is very good .",
    "we would like to add , however , that regridding the 128mhz blocks of our atca observations into a single spectrum conveys some uncertainty .",
    "for the relatively isolated nh@xmath0(4,4 ) line , our results agree well with those of @xcite .",
    "the centroids of the gaussian line fits between the gbt and atca also differ by a few tens of km  s@xmath7(table[tab : line ] ) .",
    "this may be caused by the limited signal - to - noise ratios of the spectra , despite the relatively small errors of the gaussian fits .",
    "gaussian fitting may have small systematic errors caused by the uncertain baseline subtraction and blended lines .",
    "the linewidths and peak apparent optical depths of the nh@xmath0(1,1 ) line agree between the atca and gbt observations .",
    "the other lines , however , disagree to some extent in linewidth and peak apparent optical depth .",
    "the ( 3,3 ) line is about twice as broad in the atca data as in the gbt data and the peak apparent optical depths in the gbt data for the nh@xmath0(2,2 ) and ( 3,3 ) lines are about 1/3 less than those in the atca spectrum .",
    "in addition to the ( 1,1 ) through ( 6,6 ) ammonia absorption lines , the broadband atca spectrum exhibits an additional absorption feature at @xmath72ghz ( fig.[fig : atcabroad ] ) . as with the ammonia lines",
    ", this additional spectral line appears in both spectra that were taken at that frequency ( the horizontal bars in fig.[fig : atcabroad ] show the tunings of the individual observations ) .",
    "note , however , that the two underlying individual spectra were observed simultaneously which implies that they are subject to a common systematic uncertainty and are not entirely independent measurements . at the redshift of arp 220 , the most obvious line candidates would be the @xmath73=4 - 4 and @xmath73=5 - 5 doublet of the oh @xmath17 @xmath18 transition at rest frequencies of 23817.6153mhz and 23826.6211mhz , respectively .",
    "this doublet is at an energy @xmath23k above ground state and indicates highly excited gas .",
    "adopting the rest frequency of the f=4 - 4 transition and fitting a gaussian to this line , we get a line center of @xmath74 km  s@xmath7  ( relative to the systemic velocity of @xmath64 km  s@xmath7 ) and a linewidth of @xmath75 km  s@xmath7 , very similar to the ammonia lines .",
    "these fitting results are also shown in table[tab : line ] .",
    "fitting the f=5 - 5 line alone , we find the centroid of the gaussian would be offset by @xmath76 km  s@xmath7  from systemic , likely too large for a feature that belongs to arp 220 .",
    "since the doublet lines are spaced by only @xmath77 km  s@xmath7 , however , they may be blended to produce the observed line width .",
    "a fit from blended lines would have a mean velocity offset of @xmath78 km  s@xmath7   well within the range of the line velocities observed . in either case , if the measured absorption feature indeed corresponds to one or both oh @xmath17 @xmath18 lines , it would be the first detection of this transition in an extragalactic object .",
    "to date , this doublet has only been observed toward galactic ultracompact regions such as w3(oh ) ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "lower energy oh doublets have been observed previously in arp220 .",
    "these include @xmath79 @xmath80 at 4.7ghz , @xmath17 @xmath20 at 6.0ghz , and @xmath79 @xmath81 at 7.8ghz @xcite .",
    "these detections show offset velocities in the range @xmath82 km",
    "s@xmath7  to @xmath83 km  s@xmath7 , linewidths of @xmath84 km  s@xmath7 , and apparent optical depths of @xmath85 . the parameters of these lines are consistent with those of our possible atca oh line detection . using our possible line and the @xcite @xmath17 @xmath20 f=2 - 2 detection",
    ", we estimate a rotational temperature of @xmath86k , assuming local thermal equilibrium .",
    "this estimate is about a factor of two higher than the rotational temperature we determine for ammonia ( sect.[sec : t ] ) .",
    "the line could be verified with wideband interferometric observations , for example with the new cabb backend of the atca or widar on the evla .",
    "indirect evidence could come from _ herschel _ data , via observations of rotational lines between different oh doublets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for a molecular cloud that partly covers a continuum source , in the rayleigh ",
    "jeans limit , we can express the measured brightness temperature of a spectral line ( @xmath87 ) as :    @xmath88    @xcite where @xmath89 is the excitation temperature of the line , @xmath90 is the brightness temperature of a background continuum source , @xmath91 is the brightness temperature of the cosmic microwave background , and @xmath58 is the optical depth of the line .",
    "the temperatures are scaled by the beam filling factors of the cloud ( @xmath92 ) and the continuum source ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "the source covering factor @xmath94 describes the fraction of the continuum covered by the cloud along the line of sight .",
    "we use this equation to determine the apparent optical depth @xmath58 .",
    "the source covering factor @xmath94 can be assumed to be close to unity since the individual radio continuum emitting regions are relatively small , at most a few tens of pc in size @xcite , and supposedly contain mostly supernova remnants embedded in the molecular gas ( see sect.[sec : kin ] ) .",
    "in addition , the mean gas column density in the model of @xcite is @xmath95@xmath5  and the mean gas volume density is @xmath96@xmath32  ( using the radius of the outer molecular disk of 1.2kpc , which corresponds for a cylindrical , edge - on geometry to a mean width and line of sight of 1.6kpc , a height of the cylinder of 80pc , and a gas mass of @xmath97m@xmath98 ; but see sect.[sec : dens ] ) .",
    "those large densities indicate that molecular gas is abundant and , closer to the starburst cores , ammonia is expected to be present over large regions which justifies our assumption of a source covering factor near unity . under these circumstances",
    "we can also assume that both the cloud and the continuum filling factors are the same for absorption lines , i.e. , @xmath99 .",
    "ammonia not along the line of sight toward the radio continuum would appear in emission , which is not directly observed ( but note the weak , tentative emission features adjacent to the nh@xmath0(1,1 ) line [ fig.[fig : atcabroad ] ]  the peculiarity of the ( 1,1 ) transition is discussed in sect.[sec : t ] ) . under these conditions , eq.[eq : taua ] simplifies to    @xmath100    vlbi continuum measurements at 18 cm show that the radio continuum of arp220 has an extent of @xmath101 @xcite , which corresponds to a beam filling factor of @xmath102 when compared to the beam of our atca broadband observations ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "for this value , the measured arp220 1.2 cm continuum brightness temperature of @xmath104mk then implies a true brightness temperature @xmath105k .",
    "the best spatial resolution was obtained for the nh@xmath0(6,6 ) line ( sect.[sec : obsatca ] ) and even for the @xmath106 times ( in area ) smaller beam of that observation we do not detect any extent of the continuum source . for this smaller beam of the nh@xmath0(6,6 ) observation , the same approximation then boosts the true continuum temperature limit by the same factor of 8 . on the other hand , vlbi does filter out flux on larger scales which somewhat counters the low beam filling argument",
    "nevertheless , the true continuum brightness temperature is very likely much larger than the cmb temperature of @xmath107k",
    ". we can therefore neglect @xmath91 in all further calculations .",
    "we can also disregard @xmath89 .",
    "lvg models of the ammonia molecule ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that , under normal circumstances , the excitation of inversion lines hardly exceeds @xmath108k ( see also sect[sec : dens ] ) .",
    "the continuum brightness temperature therefore dominates the radiative transfer . with those assumptions , eq.[eq : taub ] can be expressed as    @xmath109    with the approximated @xmath58 denoting the apparent optical depth.    in figs.[fig : atcabroad ] , [ fig : spec ] , and [ fig : gbtspec ] the absorption profiles of the atca and gbt observations are displayed in units of apparent optical depth ( using for both the atca continuum flux described in sec.[sec : cont ] ) .",
    "the gaussian fits to the spectra ( fig.[fig : spec ] ) result in peak apparent optical depths of @xmath110 ( table[tab : line ] ) which indicate optically thin lines .",
    "the peak apparent optical depths are similar to what @xcite finds for the nh@xmath0(1,1 ) , ( 3,3 ) , and ( 4,4 ) lines .",
    "our fit to the ( 2,2 ) line , however , is about 3 times larger than theirs .",
    "we should also note that the integrated apparent optical depths are different due to the larger linewidths reported by @xcite .",
    "using the apparent optical depths , it is possible to derive the ratios of the ammonia column densities @xmath111 and excitation temperatures @xmath112 for the two states of a given inversion doublet with the equation    @xmath113    ( @xcite ; @xmath114 in ghz ; @xmath60 : full width half maximum [ fwhm ] linewidth in kms@xmath7 ) . normalizing these with respect to their statistical weights and assuming that the excitation temperatures @xmath89 are the same for the six observed transitions , the ratio of column densities and excitation temperatures @xmath115/@xmath89 as a function of energy may be described by a boltzmann law with a specific rotational temperature @xmath116 ( or simply @xmath117 ) via    @xmath118    for a pair of inversion lines nh@xmath0(j,j ) and nh@xmath0(j , j ) [ @xmath119 is the statistical weight for a given ammonia species , @xmath120 for para - ammonia , @xmath121 for ortho ",

    "the nh@xmath0(3,3 ) datum , however , is significantly lower for the gbt observations .",
    "the weighted population of the nh@xmath40 ( 2,2 ) state is larger than that of the ( 1,1 ) state which is not expected but has been confirmed by our two independent measurements .",
    "the small nh@xmath0(1,1 ) column density is even more surprising as both transitions , nh@xmath0(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) , belong to the same para ",
    "ammonia species .",
    "both transitions have likely similar excitation temperatures and are optically thin ( table[tab : line ] , see also sect.[sec : tau ] ) .",
    "this excludes the possibility that saturation effects are responsible for different strengths of the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) transitions .",
    "an explanation for the weak nh@xmath0(1,1 ) feature could be that an additional , cool ammonia component in arp220 contaminates the absorption spectrum by ammonia ( 1,1 ) emission .",
    "this cloud needs to be cool to avoid significant population of the higher energy levels ; nh@xmath0(2,2 ) through ( 6,6 ) appear to have absorption profiles that are well described by a single rotational temperature and are likely little or not affected by any attenuation from cold gas ( see the discussion in the last paragraph of this section ) . to be seen in emission",
    ", the cold component would have to be in the beam but away from the line of sight toward the continuum .",
    "the faint emission channels adjacent to the ( 1,1 ) absorption profile of the atca data may provide an indication for such a cold component .    in spite of this complication and ignoring the unusual profile of the ( 1,1 ) line with respect to all other lines , we can estimate the rotational temperature of the gas . using the boltzmann diagram ( fig.[fig : boltz ] ) , this is performed by a weighted fit through all ( 2,2 ) , ( 3,3 ) , ( 4,4 ) , ( 5,5 ) , and ( 6,6 ) data points ( @xmath124 , with an ortho  to  para ammonia abundance ratio of 1 ) . using the atca data , we derive @xmath125k and the best fit",
    "is shown in the boltzmann plot in fig.[fig : boltz ] .",
    "note that the fit describes all data well except for the ( 1,1 ) ammonia transition .",
    "the good fit to the ( 2,2 ) though ( 6,6 ) data provides confidence that our interpretation and gaussian fits to the related spectra are reasonable in terms of peak apparent optical depths and linewidths .",
    "however , it also points toward a less reliable nh@xmath0(3,3 ) gbt flux measurement .",
    "the three lowest transitions of the gbt spectrum do not line up at all in the boltzmann plot .",
    "in addition , the gbt nh@xmath0(3,3 ) datum strongly deviates from the best fit of the atca nh@xmath0(2,2 ) through ( 6,6 ) data points .",
    "we therefore use the superior number and quality of the atca spectra throughout the rest of our analysis .",
    "since the lowest energetic ammonia ( 0,0 ) transition belongs to the ortho - ammonia species , cold ammonia _ formation _ temperatures would be reflected in an enhanced production of ortho - nh@xmath0  over para - nh@xmath0 . in that case",
    "one would observe the ( 3,3 ) and ( 6,6 ) transition data to be significantly elevated from the rotational temperature fit through all points .",
    "a @xmath89 difference between the ortho and para ammonia inversion lines , however , could compensate or strengthen a deviation from a single  line fit in the boltzmann diagram .",
    "such a difference can be well fitted by a linear function through nh@xmath0(2,2 ) and higher , which suggests that the ortho - to - para - nh@xmath0  ratio does not deviate substantially from unity . in turn , this implies that the ammonia was formed under warm conditions .",
    "@xcite show that ortho - to - para - nh@xmath0  ratios near unity require formation temperatures exceeding @xmath126k .    for low temperatures , rotational temperatures",
    "correspond well to kinetic temperatures . at higher temperatures , however , populations of more and more non - metastable levels as well as radiative decay result in a deviation from the approximation ( cf . * ? ? ? * ) . in fig.[fig : tkintrot ] we show the results on the @xmath127@xmath128 relation for different pairs of inversion transitions .",
    "this calculation is based on an lvg radiative transfer model ( described in @xcite , using the collision rates of @xcite ) . for the nh@xmath0(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) transitions , @xmath129 is valid below @xmath130k.using higher transitions , the approximate equality is valid into progressively higher temperature regimes .",
    "for that reason , it is preferable to observe high nh@xmath0  transitions if they are bright enough .",
    "nevertheless , even if the @xmath131 relation is broken , one can still apply the models displayed in fig.[fig : tkintrot ] as they only weakly depend on volume density ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "here we present logarithmic fits of @xmath132 to the rotational temperatures @xmath133 and @xmath134 , that are based on the lowest para - ammonia ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) , and the lowest ortho - ammonia ( 3,3 ) and ( 6,6 ) transitions , respectively :    @xmath135    and    @xmath136    both fits to the lvg solutions are shown in fig.[fig : tkintrot ] as dashed lines to their corresponding curves .    for arp220",
    ", we determine the rotational temperature across five transitions , rather than only a pair .",
    "eq.[eq : tkintrot12 ] can not be applied as the ( 1,1 ) level seems to be an outlier in arp220 and was excluded from our @xmath137 fit .",
    "we are using eq.[eq : tkintrot36 ] instead .",
    "this rotational temperature is calculated over a much larger energy difference of the ( 3,3 ) and ( 6,6 ) levels , rather than the smaller difference between ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) .",
    "in addition , a boltzmann fit through ( 3,3 ) and ( 6,6 ) provides the same 124k rotational temperature as the fit through ( 2,2)-(6,6 ) .",
    "for that reason , we expect that the conversion of eq .",
    "[ eq : tkintrot36 ] is a good approximation for the kinetic temperature of the ammonia - traced gas in arp220 and we derive @xmath10k .    such a kinetic temperature is similar to that found in the more nearby ` normal ' starburst galaxy ngc253 , which exhibits @xmath138k @xcite .",
    "other starburst galaxies , such as maffei2 , and m82 @xcite show lower rotational temperatures than ngc253 , which must also result in lower kinetic temperatures .    for comparison , @xcite report an intrinsic hot dust temperature component with @xmath139k toward the western nucleus of arp220 .",
    "this is comparable to what we obtain for nh@xmath0 , but might not emerge from the same physical feature ( see sect.[sec : kin ] ) .",
    "dust temperatures are somewhat lower in the outer molecular ring and over the entire body of arp220 .",
    "_ iso _ observations show two dust temperature components with 47 and 120k @xcite .",
    "the gas thus has a kinetic temperature component as high as that of the hottest dust component in arp220 .",
    "recent sma @xcite , aste @xcite , and jcmt data @xcite of highly excited , dense gas show typical temperatures of @xmath140k in the densest , @xmath141@xmath32  components , likely the gas closest to the cores . the temperature of the gas phase we determine is somewhat higher and may arise within the surrounding ring or disk ( see sects.[sec : dens ] and [ sec : kin ] , see also fig.[fig : cartoon ] ) .",
    "no direct temperature measurement has so far been reported for this physical feature .",
    "given the rotational temperatures , we can now estimate properties of any ammonia that contributes emission to explain the low absorbed flux of the ( 1,1 ) line relative to the ( 2,2 ) line .",
    "following the boltzmann plot ( fig.[fig : boltz ] ) , and assuming that the derived @xmath142 rotational temperature can be extrapolated to a hypothetical ( 1,1 ) column density , one would expect a @xmath143 times larger column density of the ( 1,1 ) line than actually measured in absorption . according to eq.[eq :",
    "nt ] , this would result in an integrated apparent optical depth @xmath143 times larger .",
    "this missing integrated apparent optical depth must be compensated for by emission of order @xmath144mjy .",
    "the gas responsible for such emission would have to be cold to avoid contaminating the other inversion profiles . for an upper limit , let us assume that the nh@xmath0(2,2 ) line is uncontaminated at a level two times below the one actually measured and that , from that level , the additional emission component raises the ( negative ) flux to the measured value .",
    "the emission line would then require a strength of @xmath145mjy . using this value as an upper limit to the nh@xmath0(2,2 ) emission component",
    ", we can derive an upper limit to the temperature from the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines . using the equations for ammonia emission",
    "as provided in @xcite , we estimate an upper rotational temperature limit of @xmath146k . with eq.[eq : tkintrot12 ] , this translates to an upper limit of the kinetic temperature of the same order of @xmath147k .",
    "this scenario can be proven by observations at high spatial resolution ( @xmath148 ) that allow direct imaging of emission components offset to the lines of sight toward the bright continuum sources .",
    "the evla may provide such observations in its extended configurations .",
    "alternatively , mm / submm interferometers such as alma and pdbi may be able to confirm the existence of this cold component . the ammonia inversion lines , however , do not fall in their wavebands and the predicted cold gas component would need to be revealed via low energy , high frequency transitions of other suitable molecular tracers .",
    "the excitation temperatures of ammonia in ulirgs is still unclear .",
    "an indication of a reasonable range might be given by the calculations of @xcite ( see their fig.3 , and using their own collision rates ) .",
    "for the ratio of an nh@xmath0  concentration to velocity gradient of 10@xmath149@xmath32(km  s@xmath7pc@xmath7)@xmath7 , they show that the excitation temperatures of the ammonia inversion lines span @xmath150k , except for a poorly confined range of parameters where the ammonia ( 3,3 ) line exhibits maser emission .",
    "all of the inversion states have similar excitation temperatures at a given density .",
    "ulirgs such as arp220 , however , could show substantially different excitation temperatures due to their high gas densities , high kinetic temperatures , and strong velocity gradients . nevertheless , assuming that the @xcite calculations provide at least an indication of the possible range",
    ", we can derive ammonia column densities using eq.[eq : nt ] .",
    "the results are listed in table[tab : dens ] .",
    "the individual inversion states exhibit column densities of order @xmath151@xmath5  for @xmath152k and @xmath153@xmath5  for @xmath154k , which add up to @xmath155@xmath5  and @xmath156@xmath5  for the two excitation temperature values , respectively .",
    "the relation scales linearly with @xmath89 , so even a high value of 100k or 150k would only modestly increase the column densities .",
    "the ( 0,0 ) ortho - ammonia level is degenerate and does not exhibit an inversion line .",
    "however , it is the lowest energy state of ammonia and thus has a significant population . to estimate the amount of ammonia in the ( 0,0 ) state",
    ", we extrapolate the @xmath157k rotational temperature in the boltzmann diagram ( fig.[fig : boltz ] ; assuming an ortho - to - para - nh@xmath0  ratio of unity ) and derive ( 0,0 ) columns of @xmath158@xmath5and @xmath159@xmath5  for excitation temperatures of 50k and 10k , respectively . adding this to the ( 1,1 ) through ( 6,6 ) columns , we derive total ammonia columns of @xmath12@xmath5  and @xmath160@xmath5  for values of @xmath161k and 10k , respectively ( see table[tab : dens ] ) .",
    "this value neglects all higher level populations , a valid assumption given the negligible contributions that these will make to the entire column if the rotational temperature stays the same for @xmath162 .",
    "for example , the ( 7,7 ) inversion line is 538k above the ground state ; by extrapolating @xmath128 via eq.[eq : trot ] in the boltzmann diagram ( fig.[fig : boltz ] ) , we see that the nh@xmath0(7,7 ) line would fall at a @xmath163 that is @xmath164 times below the nh@xmath0(6,6 ) value .    as shown in fig.[fig : gbtspec ] and in table[tab : line ] , some peak and integrated apparent optical depths differ between the atca and gbt observations . in the following ,",
    "we try to derive how the properties of the gas have changed if the different spectra are due to a time variation of the gas in front of the line of sight to the continuum ( the gbt data were observed about a year after the atca data ) .",
    "to start , we use eq.[eq : nt ] to determine @xmath163 , which is directly proportional to the integrated apparent optical depths . according to table[tab : line ] ,",
    "this translates to atca over gbt column density ratios of @xmath165 and @xmath166 for the nh@xmath0(2,2 ) and ( 3,3 ) transitions , respectively , at a given @xmath112 .",
    "the total ammonia columns depend on the temperature assumed , but , as shown in fig.[fig : boltz ] , the gbt data points are not reliable enough to determine a temperature as the nh@xmath0(1,1 ) line has very different properties .",
    "if the ( 2,2 ) and ( 3,3 ) lines are representative of the gas phase measured by the gbt , however , we can estimate a rotational temperature from the slope and we derive a cold @xmath167k . extrapolating this to higher transitions via eq.[eq : trot ] and adding the nh@xmath0(1,1 ) will then provide @xmath168@xmath5  for @xmath161 and @xmath169@xmath5  for @xmath154 , or @xmath30 times less than what we estimate from the atca data ( see table[tab : dens ] ) .",
    "this is the variation of the ammonia column that potentially may have modified the absorption profile between the atca and gbt measurements over the time of a year .",
    "eventually , we can use the total column densities to derive ammonia volume densities .",
    "@xcite show that the bulk of the molecular gas in arp220 is found in a ring or disk ( the light gray shaded area in fig.[fig : cartoon ] ) . in their model ,",
    "the size of this ring or disk is about @xmath170pc when measured from the western edge closest to the observer toward the eastern nucleus , the farthest continuum source against which we see the nh@xmath0  absorption .",
    "this geometry leads to nh@xmath0  volume densities of @xmath171@xmath32  and @xmath172@xmath32  for the @xmath173k and 10k limits , respectively ( @xmath16 is the volume filling factor of the dense gas ) .",
    "if the line of sight through the molecular gas is substantially smaller , i.e. if the absorption occurs mainly against the western core of arp220 ( see sect.[sec : kin ] ) , the volume densities increase by a factor of @xmath174 .",

    "in this article , we have presented atca and gbt observations of ammonia toward the ultraluminous far - infrared galaxy arp220 .",

    "we detect all observed ammonia lines ( @xmath42,@xmath43)=(1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) , ( 3,3 ) , ( 4,4 ) , ( 5,5 ) , and ( 6,6 ) , toward the bright continuum in absorption .",
    "2 .   the detected ammonia linewidths are in the range @xmath198 km  s@xmath7 , in agreement with those of other molecules .",
    "we can not confirm the extremely wide lines reported by @xcite .",
    "3 .   based on the atca ammonia data ( but excluding the nh@xmath0(1,1 ) line ) , we derive the rotational temperature of the molecular gas to be @xmath9k .",
    "this translates to a kinetic temperature of @xmath10k .",
    "the kinetic temperature of nh@xmath0  is similar to that found in the nucleated starburst galaxy ngc253 .",
    "we see no evidence for an ortho  to  para - ammonia ratio other than unity .",
    "this implies ammonia formation temperatures exceeding @xmath126k .",
    "5 .   combined column densities of the measured lines plus the extrapolated ( 0,0 ) column add up to @xmath160@xmath5  and @xmath12@xmath5  for assumed excitation temperatures of 10k and 50k , respectively .",
    "we estimate the volume density of the molecular gas that is traced by ammonia to be @xmath199@xmath32  ( @xmath200 : volume filling factor ) . together with the temperature estimate and the fact that the spectra are well described by single - component gaussians ,",
    "we conclude that the bulk of this moderately dense gas likely surrounds both starburst nuclei .",
    "widespread gas , based on low excitation co , exhibits densities that are about two orders of magnitude less than the ammonia - traced gas layer .",
    "this component defines the outer disk of arp220 .",
    "in contrast , the gas close to the two starburst nuclei is characterized by densities two orders of magnitude larger than the ammonia - traced gas .",
    "the gas that we see via ammonia is thus likely a layer that is located between the nuclei and the outer envelope .",
    "the geometry is most likely a ring or disk that surrounds both nuclei .",
    "the temperature profile appears to have a local maximum at the position of the gas that is traced by ammonia .",
    "the nh@xmath0(1,1 ) line is weaker than expected for thermal gas based on all other measured nh@xmath0  transitions . a possible explanation for this unusual behavior could be an additional , cold , @xmath3k component of molecular gas , located inside the beam but displaced from the lines of sight toward the continuum sources in arp220 .",
    "this gas , if present , would have to be at an estimated column density of @xmath201@xmath5  to sufficiently mask the ( 1,1 ) absorption .",
    "the cool temperature is required to keep the masking of the other lines to a minimum .",
    "we also detect an absorption feature adjacent in frequency to the nh@xmath0(3,3 ) line in the atca data but not in the gbt data .",
    "this absorption feature may be interpreted as an oh @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 transition , or the combination of the f=4 - 4 and f=5 - 5 oh doublet .",
    "both options yield line parameters similar to that of ammonia , including a rotational temperature that is about 2 times larger for oh . if this detection holds , it would be the first extragalactic evidence for this line which has so far only been seen toward galactic compact regions such as w3(oh )",
    "the atca and gbt data show some differences in their line shapes .",
    "this is most likely an instrumental effect of the two very different telescopes and observing procedures .",
    "we can not exclude , however , that there is intrinsic time variability of the gas distribution in arp220 along the narrow lines of sight toward the absorbing background structure .",
    "if this is the case , then the gbt data suggests gas with a @xmath174 times cooler rotational temperature than that of the atca measurement , and the column density would be @xmath30 times lower at the time when the gbt observations were taken ( a year after the atca observations ) .",
    "given the typical cloud and continuum size scales of a few to tens of parsec and the velocities of a few hundred km  s@xmath7 , however , drastic variations of the absorption spectra on annual timescales seem to be unlikely and an instrumental effect is more plausible .",

    "<S> we present australia telescope compact array ( atca ) and robert c. byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) observations of ammonia ( nh@xmath0 ) and the 1.2 cm radio continuum toward the ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) merger arp220 . </S>",
    "<S> we detect the nh@xmath0(1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) , ( 3,3 ) , ( 4,4 ) , ( 5,5 ) , and ( 6,6 ) inversion lines in absorption against the unresolved , @xmath1mjy continuum source at 1.2 cm . </S>",
    "<S> the peak apparent optical depths of the ammonia lines range from @xmath2 0.05 to 0.18 . </S>",
    "<S> the absorption lines are well described by single - component gaussians with central velocities in between the velocities of the eastern and western cores of arp220 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the ammonia likely traces gas that encompasses both cores . </S>",
    "<S> the absorption depth of the nh@xmath0(1,1 ) line is significantly shallower than expected based on the depths of the other transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the shallow ( 1,1 ) profile may be caused by contamination from emission by a hypothetical , cold ( @xmath3k ) gas layer with an estimated column density of @xmath4@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this layer would have to be located behind or away from the radio continuum sources to produce the contaminating emission . </S>",
    "<S> the widths of the ammonia absorption lines are @xmath6 km  s@xmath7 , in agreement with those of other molecular tracers </S>",
    "<S> . we can not confirm the extremely large linewidths of up to @xmath8 km  s@xmath7 previously reported for this galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> using all of the atca detections except for the shallow ( 1,1 ) line , we determine a rotational temperature of @xmath9k , corresponding to a kinetic temperature of @xmath10k . </S>",
    "<S> ammonia column densities depend on the excitation temperature . for excitation temperatures of 10k and 50k , we estimate @xmath11@xmath5  and @xmath12@xmath5 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the relation scales linearly for possible higher excitation temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> our observations are consistent with an ortho  to  para - ammonia ratio of unity , implying that the ammonia formation temperature exceeds @xmath13k . in the context of a model with a molecular ring that connects the two nuclei in arp220 </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate the h@xmath14  gas density to be @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the volume filling factor of the molecular gas . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to ammonia , our atca data show an absorption feature adjacent in frequency to the nh@xmath0(3,3 ) line . </S>",
    "<S> the line does not appear in the gbt spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> if we interpret the line to be from the oh @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 transition , it would have a linewidth , systemic velocity , and apparent optical depth similar to what we detect in the ammonia lines . comparing the new line to the previously detected 6ghz oh @xmath17 @xmath20 @xmath21 transition </S>",
    "<S> , we determine a rotational oh temperature of @xmath22k , about 2 times the rotational temperature of ammonia . </S>",
    "<S> if this association with oh is correct , it marks the first detection of the highly excited ( @xmath23k above ground state ) @xmath17 </S>",
