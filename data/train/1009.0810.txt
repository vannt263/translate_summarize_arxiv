    ", what is the maximum size of the collection in order to ensure the existence of another such structure that shares at most @xmath20 elements with each structure in the collection ?",
    "this problem is also known as the covering radius problem .",
    "this research problem has its origins in group theory , particularly in the permutation group @xmath21 acting on the set @xmath22 $ ] of natural numbers from @xmath23 to @xmath24 . in any collection @xmath25 of permutations",
    ", we can measure the _ hamming distance _ ( or distance ) @xmath26 between a permutation @xmath27 in @xmath25 and any permutation @xmath28 picked from @xmath21 . here , the hamming distance between two permutations is the number of positions in which they defer .",
    "for example , in @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "if we were to fix @xmath28 above and measure the distances @xmath31 for every @xmath32 , there exists a minimum distance which we can obtain between @xmath28 and some which gives a minimum distance . ]",
    "@xmath33 , i.e. @xmath34 .",
    "now , repeating this procedure for every permutation @xmath35 , we can find the maximum of all the minimum distances measured earlier .",
    "this maximum value , denoted @xmath36 , is the covering radius of the collection @xmath25 ; in fact , a simple argument shows that @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , the covering radius problem is the problem of finding or , in many cases , estimating the covering radius of any given collection of permutations .",
    "apropos of recent research , lower bounds of the covering radius of @xmath25 of @xmath21 have been established by cameron and wanless ( 2005 ) in @xcite , in which covering arguments were used to formulate a general criteria to find lower bounds of covering radii of sets of permutations .",
    "keevash and ku ( 2006 ) later improved ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) the general criteria , obtaining an even stronger result to determine the lower bound of the covering radius of any collection of permutations with some constraints vis -  - vis a frequency parameter .",
    "their result is the best possible so far . covering radius results have profound applications and implications in group theory and combinatorial structures",

    "moreover , similar classes of problems for intersecting families of finite sets have been studied extensively , and in particular @xcite and @xcite are good sources of information .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the analogue of the problem mentioned above for perfect matchings in complete graphs .",
    "our fundamental question is as follows :    suppose we have a finite collection of perfect matchings of @xmath0 .",
    "what is the largest possible number of elements in this collection such that we can find a perfect matching of @xmath0 that _ agrees _ with each perfect matching in the collection in at most @xmath6 edges ?    let @xmath38 denote an arbitrary perfect matching of @xmath0 .",
