    "hadron spectroscopy has undergone a great renaissance in recent years  @xcite .",
    "the new findings include : low - lying excitations of d and b mesons , long - awaited missing states and new states near 4 gev / c@xmath0 in the charmonium spectrum , charmed and bottom baryons , and evidence for doubly charmed baryons .",
    "the light hadron sector remains also restless reporting new scalar mesons or showing a deep theoretical interest in the high energy part of both the meson and baryon spectra . in this talk",
    "we center our attention in the heavy baryon spectroscopy as well as some anomalous states present in the light baryon spectra .",
    "heavy baryons containing a single heavy quark are particularly interesting .",
    "the light degrees of freedom ( quarks and gluons ) circle around the nearly static heavy quark .",
    "such a system behaves as the qcd analogue of the familiar hydrogen bounded by the electromagnetic interaction . when the heavy quark mass @xmath1 , the angular momentum of the light degrees of freedom is a good quantum number .",
    "thus , heavy quark baryons belong to either su(3 ) antisymmetric @xmath2 or symmetric @xmath3 representations .",
    "the spin of the light diquark is 0 for @xmath2 , while it is 1 for @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the spin of the ground state baryons is @xmath4 for @xmath2 , representing the @xmath5 and @xmath6 baryons , while it can be both @xmath4 or @xmath7 for @xmath3 , allocating @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where the star indicates spin @xmath7 states",
    ". therefore heavy hadrons form doublets .",
    "for example , @xmath8 and @xmath14 will be degenerate in the heavy quark limit .",
    "their mass splitting is caused by the chromomagnetic interaction at the order @xmath15 .",
    "these effects can be , for example , taken into account systematically in the framework of heavy quark effective field theory . the mass difference between states belonging to the @xmath2 and @xmath3 representations",
    "do also contain the dynamics of the light diquark subsystem , hard to accommodate in any heavy quark mass expansion .",
    "therefore , exact solutions of the three - body problem for heavy hadrons are theoretically desirable because they will serve to test the reliability of approximate techniques : heavy quark mass expansions , variational calculations , or quark - diquark approximations .",
    ".masses , in mev , of charmed and bottom baryons . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     although the value of @xmath16 might vary depending on the configurations involved in each @xmath17 coupling we shall use for the sake of simplicity the same value in all cases .",
    "the @xmath18 results for @xmath19 mev are numerically detailed in table  [ t2 ] where the values for @xmath20 and for ( @xmath21 in the chosen @xmath22 channel as well as their probabilities to give @xmath18 are also displayed .",
    "as can be checked the improvement of the description with respect to @xmath23 is astonishing .",
    "all the predicted @xmath18 masses lye very close to the pdg average masses for the anomalies . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the @xmath18 values for @xmath24 mev are drawn  as compared to the experimental mass intervals .",
    "( boxes ) .",
    "n.c . means non - cataloged resonance.,width=415 ]    we interpret these results as providing strong quantitative support to our former qualitative description of the anomalies .",
    "regarding their nature a look at the probabilities reveal they are mostly meson - baryon states .",
    "actually a meson - baryon probability greater or equal than @xmath25 can serve as a criterion to identify an anomaly .",
    "nonetheless the coupling to the @xmath26 component is essential to lower their masses making them more stable against decay into @xmath27 .",
    "it should be emphasized that similar results could be obtained for any other spectroscopic @xmath28 model through a fine tuning of the value of @xmath29 ( note that the small value of @xmath30 as compared to @xmath20 and @xmath31 provides an _ a posteriori _ validation of our method)@xmath32 this comes from the expression of the eigenvalues where it is clear that even for @xmath33 one gets @xmath34 which according to our @xmath22 choice is much closer to the pdg mass of the anomaly than @xmath20 .",
    "this means that concerning the mass of the anomalies the coupling of meson - baryon to @xmath26 components may play the role of a general _ healing mechanism _ for spectroscopic models .",
    "we have studied the heavy baryon spectra by means of the faddeev method in momentum space .",
    "these results should be highly valuable both from the theoretical and experimental points of view .",
    "theoretically , it should be a powerful tool for testing different approximate methods to solve the three - body problem .",
    "experimentally , the remarkable agreement with known experimental data make our predictions highly valuable as a guideline to experimentalists .",
    "heavy baryons constitute an extremely interesting problem joining the dynamics of light - light and heavy - light subsystems in an amazing manner . while the mass difference between members of the same su(3 ) configuration , either @xmath2 or @xmath3 , is determined by the perturbative one - gluon exchange , the mass difference between members of different representations comes mainly determined by the dynamics of the light diquark , and should therefore be determined in consistency with the light baryon spectra .",
    "there is therefore a remnant effect of pseudoscalar forces in the two - light quark subsystem .    for light baryons",
    "we propose that @xmath35 components , in the form of @xmath36 wave meson - baryon channels which we identify , play an essential role in the description of the anomalies , say baryon resonances very significantly overpredicted by three - quark models based on two - body interactions . as a matter of fact by considering a simplified description of the anomalies as systems composed of a free meson - baryon channel interacting with a three - quark confined component we have shown they could correspond mostly to meson - baryon states but with a non - negligible @xmath26 state probability which makes their masses to be below the meson - baryon threshold .",
    "the remarkable agreement of our results with data in all cases suggests the implementation of meson - baryon threshold effects as an essential physical mechanism to give account of spectral states poorly described by constituent quark models ."
