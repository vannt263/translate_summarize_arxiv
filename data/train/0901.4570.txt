    "the area of the system is @xmath184 and the transverse size is @xmath185 .",
    "now , let us focus on the edge part .",
    "if we fill in only one edge state with @xmath186 , the momentum shift by the flux - insertion - removal trick is @xmath187 .",
    "the number of edge state then equal to the ground state degeneracy .",
    "since the gauge argument holds only when the ground state is protected by a finite gap , we can move one edge state to another between the nodal points .",
    "another interesting perspective is to relate the existence of aes to the underlying structure of the effective 1d model.@xcite the semi - infinte lattice can be mapped into effective 1d models . by choosing an appropriate unit cell , the 1d chain will contain only nearest - neighbor hopping described by the general hamiltonian @xmath188 where @xmath189 is the hopping matrix connecting nearest - neighbor cells and @xmath190 for the hopping within the cell . the matrices @xmath191 and @xmath189 are square matrices with @xmath192 rows , where @xmath192 is the number of effective lattice site in the unit cell .",

    "we construct the edge states from the bloch states , @xmath194 , where @xmath56 satisfies @xmath195 .",
    "the boundary condition is extremely simple in this representation , @xmath196 .",
    "therefore , the number of the edge states is the dimension of the null space of of @xmath189 .",
    "if the rank of matrix @xmath189 is full , it means no edge state .",
    "in fact , the reflection symmetry with respect to the open boundary often implies that the rank of @xmath189 is full .",
    "for example , the @xmath122-wave pairing symmetry at the zigzag edge , one can find out that @xmath56 in the bloch state should satisfy eq.([zsol1 ] ) with @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "that is to say , if @xmath56 is a solution , @xmath199 is also a solution .",
    "thus , except the nodal points , there are always two zero modes with @xmath200 .",
    "since there are also two constraints , we end up with no edge state .",
