    "moduli are light scalar fields with only higher - dimensional couplings to other light species .",
    "they arise frequently in theories with supersymmetry  @xcite , and they appear to be a generic feature of string compactifications  @xcite .",
    "moduli fields can also have significant implications for the cosmological history of the universe , the mass spectrum of the supersymmetric partners of the standard model  ( sm ) , and the density of dark matter  ( dm ) today  @xcite .",
    "a modulus field can alter the standard cosmology if it is significantly displaced from the minimum of its potential in the early universe , as can occur following primordial inflation  @xcite .",
    "the modulus will be trapped by hubble damping until @xmath0 , at which point it will begin to oscillate .",
    "the energy density of these oscillations dilutes in the same way as non - relativistic matter , and can easily come to dominate the expansion of the universe .",
    "this will continue until the modulus decays at time @xmath1 , transferring the remaining oscillation energy into radiation . at this point ,",
    "called _ reheating _ , the radiation temperature is approximately  @xcite t _  ~   ( 5)()()^3/2  , [ eq : trhintro ] where @xmath2 is the heavy mass scale characterizing the coupling of the modulus to light matter . to avoid disrupting primordial nucleosynthesis ,",
    "the reheating temperature should be greater than about @xmath3  @xcite , and this places a lower bound on the modulus mass .",
    "the mass of a modulus field is determined by its potential . in string compactifications",
    ", multiple moduli typically appear in the low - energy supergravity theory as components of chiral multiplets with couplings to other fields suppressed by powers of @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "while the potentials of many of these moduli are not completely understood , certain features do seem to be fairly universal .",
    "for example , moduli masses of @xmath5 are expected when the potential arises mainly from supersymmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "moduli may also have supersymmetric potentials  @xcite , and @xmath6 is found in some cases  @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath5 is still frequently obtained from supersymmetric potentials once the constraint of a very small vacuum energy is imposed  @xcite .",
    "thus , a plausible generic expectation from string theory is that there exists at least one modulus field with @xmath5 and @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "other heavier moduli may be present , but since the lightest and most weakly - coupled modulus will decay the latest , it is expected to have the greatest impact on the present - day cosmology .",
    "putting these two pieces together , acceptable reheating from string moduli suggests @xmath7 .",
    "this has important implications for the masses of the sm superpartner fields .",
    "surveying the most popular mechanisms of supersymmetry breaking mediation  @xcite , the typical size of the superpartner masses is m_~\\ {    ccccc m_3/2 & & + ( ) m_3/2 & & + lm_3/2 & &    . where @xmath8 is a typical loop factor and @xmath9 is the mass of the gauge messengers .",
    "of these mechanisms , only anomaly mediation  ( amsb ) allows for superpartners that are light enough to be directly observable at the large hadron collider  ( lhc )  @xcite .",
    "contributions to the soft terms of similar size can also be generated by the moduli themselves  @xcite , or other sources  @xcite .",
    "however , for these amsb and amsb - like contributions to be dominant , the gravity - mediated contributions must be suppressed  @xcite , which is non - trivial for the scalar soft masses  @xcite .",
    "an interesting intermediate scenario is mini - split supersymmetry where the dominant scalar soft masses come from direct gravity mediation with @xmath10 , while the gaugino soft masses are amsb - like  @xcite .",
    "moduli reheating can also modify dark matter production  @xcite . a standard weakly - interacting massive particle  ( wimp )",
    "@xmath11 will undergo thermal freeze - out at temperatures near @xmath12 .",
    "if this is larger than the reheating temperature , the wimp density will be strongly diluted by the entropy generated from moduli decays . on the other hand ,",
    "dm can be created _ non - thermally _ as moduli decay products .",
    "a compelling picture of non - thermal dark matter arises very naturally for string - like moduli and an amsb - like superpartner mass spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the lightest ( viable ) superpartner  ( lsp ) in this case tends to be a wino - like neutralino .",
    "these annihilate too efficiently to give the observed relic density through thermal freeze - out  @xcite .",
    "however , with moduli domination and reheating , the wino lsp can be created non - thermally in moduli decays , and the correct dm density is obtained for @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this scenario works precisely because the wino annihilation cross section is larger than what is needed for thermal freeze - out .",
    "unfortunately , such enhanced annihilation rates are strongly constrained by gamma - ray observations of the galactic centre by fermi and hess , and the non - thermal wino is ruled out even for very conservative assumptions about the dm profile in the inner galaxy ( _ e.g. _ cored isothermal )  @xcite .",
    "a wino - like lsp can be consistent with these bounds if it is only a subleading component of the total dm density . using the amsb relation for @xmath15 in terms of @xmath16 , this forces @xmath17 , significantly greater than the generic expectation  @xcite .",
    "the problem is even worse for other neutralino lsp species , since these annihilate less efficiently and an even larger value of @xmath6 is needed to obtain an acceptable relic density .",
    "furthermore , @xmath18 also allows the modulus field to decay to pairs of gravitinos .",
    "the width for this decay is typically similar to the total width to sm superpartners  @xcite . for @xmath19",
    ", the gravitinos produced this way will decay to particle - superpartner pairs before nucleosynthesis but after the modulus decays , and recreate the same lsp density problem that forced @xmath6 in the first place .",
    "these results suggest a degree of tension between reheating by string - motivated moduli ( with @xmath5 and @xmath4 ) and the existence of a stable tev - scale lsp in the minimal supersymmetric standard model  ( mssm ) .",
    "this tension can be resolved if all relevant moduli have properties that are slightly different from the nave expectation ; for example @xmath6 and @xmath20  @xcite , an enhanced modulus decay rate with @xmath5 and @xmath21  @xcite , or a suppressed modulus branching fraction into superpartners  @xcite . given the challenges and uncertainties associated with moduli stabilization in string theory , we focus on what seem to be more generic moduli and we investigate a second approach : extensions of the mssm that contain new lsp candidates with smaller relic densities or that are more difficult to detect than their mssm counterparts .    in this paper we investigate extensions of the mssm containing additional hidden gauge sectors as a way to avoid the moduli - induced lsp problem of the mssm .",
    "such gauge extensions arise frequently in grand - unified theories  @xcite and string compactifications  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the dominant mediation of supersymmetry breaking to gauginos is proportional to the corresponding gauge coupling , as in anomaly or gauge mediation , allowing the hidden sector gauginos to be lighter than those of the mssm if the former have a smaller coupling constant  @xcite .",
    "we also focus on the case of a single light modulus field with @xmath5 and @xmath4 , although similar results are expected to hold for multiple moduli or for reheating by gravitino decays .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : reheat ] we review moduli cosmology and the resulting non - thermal production of lsps .",
    "next , in section  [ sec : mssm ] we examine in more detail the tension between moduli reheating and a stable mssm lsp . in the subsequent three sections we present three extensions of the mssm containing new lsp candidates and examine their abundances and signals following moduli reheating .",
    "the first extension , discussed in section  [ sec : u1sym ] , comprises a minimal supersymmetric @xmath22 hidden sector .",
    "we find that this setup allows for a hidden sector lsp with a relic density lower than that of the wino and which is small enough to evade the current bounds from indirect detection . in section  [ sec : u1asym ]",
    "we extend the @xmath22 hidden sector to include an asymmetric dark matter candidate and find that it is able to saturate the entire observed dm relic density while avoiding constraints from indirect detection . in section  [ sec : sun ] we investigate a pure non - abelian hidden sector , and show that the corresponding gaugino lsp can provide an acceptable relic density and avoid constraints from indirect detection , although it is also very strongly constrained by its effect on structure formation and the cosmic microwave background .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conc ] is reserved for our conclusions .",
    "in this section we review briefly the cosmology of moduli oscillation and decay , as well as the associated non - thermal production of dark matter .",
    "a modulus field @xmath23 is very likely to develop a large initial displacement from the minimum of its potential before or during the course of primordial inflation  @xcite .",

    "<S> moduli fields with planck - suppressed couplings to light species are common in string compactifications . </S>",

    "<S> , the non - thermal production of the lightest superpartner  ( lsp ) tends to create an unacceptably large relic density or too strong of an indirect detection signal . </S>",
