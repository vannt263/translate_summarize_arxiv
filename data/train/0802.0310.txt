    "in many extensions of the standard model ( sm ) , new massive and neutral gauge bosons , called @xmath7 , are predicted @xcite .",
    "the detection of a @xmath0 resonance have became in a matter of high priority in particle physics , which could reveal many features about the underlying unified theory .",
    "indirect search for these neutral bosons have been carried out at lep , through mixing with the @xmath8 boson @xcite .",
    "direct @xmath0 production have been currently proved at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "the discovery potential for @xmath0 particles have been explored at the forthcoming large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite in the @xmath9 tev range .",
    "the search for this particle have also been explored in the planned international liner collider ( ilc ) @xcite .",
    "there are many theoretical models which predict a @xmath0 mass in the tev range , where the most popular are the @xmath10 motivated models @xcite , the left - right symetric model ( lrm ) @xcite , the @xmath0 in little higgs scenario @xcite and the sequential standard model ( ssm ) , which has heavier couplings than those of the sm z boson . searching for @xmath11 in the above models has been widely studied in the literature @xcite and applied at lep2 , tevatron and lhc . on the other hand , the models with gauge symmetry @xmath12 also called 331 models @xcite ,",
    "arise as an interesting alternative with @xmath0 boson and many well - established motivations .",
    "first of all , from the cancellation of chiral anomalies @xcite and asymptotic freedom in qcd , the 3 - 3 - 1 models can explain why there are three fermion families .",
    "secondly , since the third family is treated under a different representation , the large mass difference between the heaviest quark family and the two lighter ones may be understood @xcite .",
    "thirdly , the models have a scalar content similar to the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , which allow to predict the quantization of electric charge and the vectorial character of the electromagnetic interactions quantum - charge , vectorlike .",
    "also , these models contain a natural peccei - quinn symmetry , necessary to solve the strong - cp problem pc , pc331 .",
    "finally , the model introduces new types of matter relevant to the next generations of colliders at the tev energy scales , which do not spoil the low energy limits at the electroweak scale .",
    "although the theoretical and phenomenological features associated to the @xmath11 boson is widely described in the literature @xcite-@xcite , there are few studies at tevatron and lhc colliders of the @xmath0 boson in the framework of the 331 models @xcite . in this work we search for @xmath0 bosons in dielectron events produced in @xmath1 and @xmath13 collisions for tevatron and lhc colliders , respectively in the framework of the 331 model with right - handed neutrinos , which we denote as the foot - long - truan ( flt ) model @xcite .",
    "the fermionic structure is shown in tab . [ tab : espectro ] where all leptons transforms as @xmath14 and @xmath15 under the @xmath16 sector , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 the @xmath19 generators associated with the left- and right - handed leptons , respectively ; while the quarks transforms as @xmath20 , @xmath21 for the first two families , and @xmath22 , @xmath23 for the third family , each one with its @xmath19 values for the left- and right - handed quarks .",

    "@xmath32    for the scalar sector , we introduce the triplet field @xmath33 with vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath34 , which induces the masses to the third fermionic components . in the second transition",
    "it is necessary to introduce two triplets@xmath35 and @xmath36 with vev @xmath37 and @xmath38 in order to give masses to the quarks of type up and down respectively @xcite .    in the gauge boson spectrum associated with the group @xmath39 we are just interested in the physical neutral sector that corresponds to the photon , @xmath8 , and @xmath40 which are written in terms of the electroweak basis for any @xmath41 as @xcite    @xmath42    where the weinberg angle is defined as @xcite    @xmath43    and @xmath44 @xmath45 correspond to the coupling constants of the groups @xmath46 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "it is to note that the @xmath8 and @xmath0 bosons in eq .",
    "( [ neutral bosons ] ) are not truly masss eigenstates , but there is a @xmath47 mixing angle that rotate the neutral sector to the physical @xmath48 and @xmath49 bosons .",
