    "using the model for mass matrices presented by us in an other contribution  @xcite at this conference we want to compute the amount of baryons produced in the early universe .",
    "this model works by having the mass matrix elements being suppressed by approximately conserved quantum numbers from a gauge group repeated for each family of quarks and leptons and also having a @xmath6 charge for each family .",
    "the baryon number density relative to entropy density , @xmath7 , is one of the rather few quantities that can give us information about the laws of nature beyond the standard model and luckily we have from the understanding of the production of light isotopes at the minute scale in big bang fits to this quantity  @xcite .",
    "the `` experimental '' data of the ratio of baryon number density to the entropy density is @xmath8 we already had a good fit of all the masses and mixings  @xcite for both quarks and leptons measured so far and agreeing with all the bounds such as neutrinoless beta decay and proton decay not being seen and matching on the borderline but consistent with the accuracy of our model and of the experiment of chooz the electron to heaviest left - handed neutrino mixing , and that in a version of our model in which the dominant matrix element in the right - handed neutrino mass matrix is the diagonal one for the `` third '' ( @xmath0 with same @xmath9 as the third family ) family @xmath10 right - handed neutrino .",
    "this version of our model which fits otherwise very well does not give sufficient @xmath6 excess , that survives , but the by now the best model in our series should have the right - handed mass matrix dominated by the off - diagonal elements @xmath11 and @xmath12 , so that there appears two almost mass degenerate see - saw neutrinos , in addition to the third one ( first family ) which is much lighter .",
    "our model produces mass matrix elements  or effective yukawa couplings  which are suppressed from being of the order of the top - mass because they are forbidden by the conservation of the gauge charges of our model and can only become different from zero using the @xmath13 higgs fields  @xcite which we have in addition to the field replacing the weinberg - salam one . in the neutrino sector according to the see - saw mechanism  @xcite we have to calculate dirac- and majorana - mass matrices , @xmath14 , to obtain the effective mass matrix @xmath15 for the left handed neutrinos we in practice can `` see '' . here",
    "we present all mass matrices as they follow from our choice of quantum numbers for the @xmath16 higgs fields in our model and for the quarks and leptons ( as they can be found in the other contribution ) .",
    "only the quantum numbers for the field called @xmath17 is  in order to get degenerate see - saw neutrinos",
    " changed into having the @xmath18 quantum numbers of family @xmath19 and @xmath20 equal to @xmath21 , @xmath0 , @xmath22 , while the other family quantum numbers are just zero :    the up - type quarks : @xmath23 the down - type quarks : @xmath24 the charged leptons : @xmath25 the dirac neutrinos : @xmath26 and the majorana ( right - handed ) neutrinos : @xmath27 we shall remember that it is here understood that all the matrix elements are to be provided with order of unity factors which we do not know and in practice have treated by inserting random order of unity factors over which we then average at the end ( in a logarithmic way ) .",
    "the model for the yukawa couplings we use gives , in principle , these couplings at the fundamental scale , taken to be the planck scale , at first , and we then use the renormalisation group to run them down to the scales where they are to be confronted with experiment . from the planck scale down to the see - saw scale or rather from where our gauge group is broken down to @xmath28 we use the one - loop renormalisation group running of the yukawa coupling constant matrices and the gauge couplings  @xcite in gut notation including the running of dirac neutrino yukawa coupling : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the renormalisation point .    in order to run the renormalisation group equations down to @xmath32",
    ", we use the following initial values : @xmath33 we varied the @xmath13 free parameters and found the best fit , corresponding to the lowest value for the quantity @xmath34 ^ 2=3.38 $ ] , with the following values for the vevs : @xmath35 where , except for the weinberg - salam higgs field and @xmath36 , the vevs are expressed in planck units .",
    "hereby we have considered that the weinberg - salam higgs field vev is already fixed by the fermi constant .",
    "the results of the best fit , with the vevs in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vevs ] ) , are shown in table  [ convbestfit ] .",
    "since the baryogenesis in the fukugita - yanagida scheme  @xcite arises from a negative excess of lepton number being converted by sphalerons to a positive baryon number excess partly and this negative excess comes from the @xmath38 violating decay of the see - saw neutrinos we shall introduce the parameters @xmath39 giving the measure of the relative asymmetry under @xmath40 or @xmath38 in the decay of neutrino number @xmath41 :  defining the measure @xmath39 for the @xmath38 violation @xmath42 where @xmath43 are @xmath44 decay rates ( in the @xmath44 rest frame ) , summed over the neutral and charged leptons ( and weinberg - salam higgs fields ) which appear as final states in the @xmath44 decays one sees that the excess of leptons over anti - leptons produced in the decay of one @xmath44 is just @xmath39 .",
    "the total decay rate at the tree level is given by @xmath45where @xmath46 can be expressed through the unitary matrix diagonalising the right - handed neutrino mass matrix @xmath47 : @xmath48 the @xmath38 violation rateis computed according to  @xcite @xmath49 \\left[\\ , f \\left ( \\frac{m_j^2}{m_i^2 } \\right ) + g \\left ( \\frac{m_j^2}{m_i^2 } \\right)\\,\\right]}{4 \\pi \\svev{\\phi_{\\scriptscriptstyle ws}}^2 ( ( \\widetilde{m_\\nu^d})^{\\dagger}\\widetilde{m_\\nu^d})_{ii}}\\ ] ] where the function , @xmath50 , comes from the one - loop vertex contribution and the other function , @xmath51 , comes from the self - energy contribution . these @xmath52 s can be calculated in perturbation theory only for differences between majorana neutrino masses which are sufficiently large compare to their decay widths , @xmath0 , the mass splittings satisfy the condition , @xmath53 : @xmath54\\hspace{2 mm } ,   \\hspace{2 mm } \\hspace{2 mm } g(x)=\\frac{\\sqrt{x}}{1-x } \\hspace{2mm}.\\ ] ] we as usual  @xcite introduce the dacay rate relative to @xmath55where @xmath56 is the width of the flavour @xmath41 majorana neutrino , @xmath57 is its mass and @xmath58 is the number of degrees of freedom at the temperature @xmath57 ( in our model @xmath59 ) .    in order to estimate the effective @xmath60 factors we first introduce some normalized state vectors for the decay products : @xmath61_{k i}}^2\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(\\,\\left [ \\widetilde{m_\\nu^d}(m_i)\\right]_{1 i }   \\ , , \\left[\\widetilde{m_\\nu^d}(m_i)\\right]_{2 i } \\ , , \\left[\\widetilde{m_\\nu^d}(m_i)\\right]_{3 i}\\,\\right)\\nonumber\\hspace{2mm},\\]]then we may take an approximation for the effective @xmath60 factors : @xmath62",
    "using the yukawa couplings  as coming from the vevs of our seven different higgs fields  the numerical calculation of baryogenesis were performed using our random order unity factor method . in order to get baryogenesis in fukugita - yanagida scheme , we calculated the see - saw neutrino masses , @xmath63 factors and @xmath38 violation parameters using @xmath64 random number combinations and logarithmic average method : @xmath65    m_2= 8.8 \\times 10^{9}~\\mbox{\\rm gev}\\hspace{2 mm } , & { k_{\\scriptscriptstyle\\rm eff}}_2 = 116.2\\hspace{2 mm } , &   \\abs{\\epsilon_2 } = 4.00\\times 10^{-6}\\hspace{2 mm } \\\\*[0.2 cm ]    m_3= 9.9 \\times 10^{9}~\\mbox{\\rm gev}\\hspace{2 mm } , & { k_{\\scriptscriptstyle\\rm eff}}_3= 114.7\\hspace{2 mm } , & \\abs{\\epsilon_3 } = 3.27\\times 10^{-6}\\hspace{2 mm } \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the sign of @xmath39 is unpredictable due to the complex random number coefficients in mass matrices",
    ", therefore we are not in the position to say the sign of @xmath52 s . using the complex order unity random numbers being given by a gaussian distribution we get after logarithmic averaging using the dilution factors as presented by  @xcite @xmath66 where we have estimated the uncertainty in the natural exponent according ref .",
    "@xcite to be @xmath67 .",
    "the understanding of how this baryon to entropy prediction @xmath7 comes about in the model may be seen from the following ( analytical ) estimate @xmath68 where we left out for simplicity the @xmath69 factor in the denominator of the dilution factor @xmath70 and where @xmath71 is the mass of one of the heavy right - handed neutrinos in our model @xmath72 . since the atmospheric mass square difference square root @xmath73",
    "we see that keeping it leaves us with the dependence @xmath74",
    "to make a better estimate of the wash - out effect we may make use of the calculations by  @xcite by putting effective values for the see - saw neutrino mass @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the most important wash - out is due to `` on - shell '' formation of right - handed neutrinos and only depends on @xmath60 or the thereto proportional @xmath76 , but next there are wash - out effects going rather than by @xmath60 or @xmath76 as @xmath77 . in the presentation of the results by @xcite fixed ratios between right - handed neutrino masses were assumed .",
    "however , in reality a very important wash - out comes form the off - shell inverse decay and that goes as @xmath78_{jj}}{m_j}\\ ] ] here we use the notation with @xmath79 from  @xcite : @xmath80 .",
    "using such a term ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : til ] ) with the ansatz ratios used in  @xcite , @xmath81 and @xmath82 one gets for eq .",
    "( [ eq : til ] ) @xmath83 , while we would with our mass ratios ( eq .  [ eq : metc ] ) @xmath84 and @xmath85 obtain correspondingly @xmath86 , which then being identified with @xmath87 would lead to that we should effectively use for simulating our model the mass of the right handed neutrino  which is a parameter in the presentation of the dilution effects in  @xcite  @xmath88 . inserting this @xmath89 value for our estimate",
    "@xmath90 gives a dilution factor @xmath91 , @xmath0 , a factor @xmath3 less than what we used with our estimate using the @xmath92 s .",
    "( our @xmath93 are surprisingly large compared to the @xmath94 because of renormalzation running . ) using the better calculation of  @xcite which has a very steep dependence ",
    "a fourth power say  as function of @xmath76 our uncertainty should also be corrected to a factor 100 up or down .",
    "so then we have one and a half standard deviations of getting too little baryon number .",
    "we calculated the baryon density relative to the entropy density  baryogenesis  from our model order of magnitudewise .",
    "this model already fits to quark and lepton masses and mixing angles using _ only six parameters _ , vacuum expectation values .",
    "we got a result for the baryon number predicting about a factor only three less than the fitting to microwave background fluctuations obtained by buchmller  @xmath95  @xcite , when we used our crude @xmath96 s approximation .",
    "however , using the estimate extracted from the calculations of  @xcite we got three orders of magnitude too low prediction of the baryon number .",
    "this estimate must though be considered a possibly too low estimate because there is one scattering effect that is strongly suppressed with our masses but which were included in that calculation . but even the latter estimate should because of the steep dependence of the result on the parameters be considered more uncertain and considering the deviation of our prediction only @xmath97 is not unreasonable .    since we used the fukugita - yanagida mechanism of obtaining first a lepton number excess being converted ( successively by sphalerons ) into the baryon number , our success in this prediction should be considered not only a victory for our model for mass matrices but also for this mechanism . since",
    "our model would be hard to combine with supersymmetry  it would loose much of its predictive power by having to double the higgs fields  we should consider it in a susy scenario and thus we can without problems take the energy scale to inflation / reheating to be so high that the plasma had already had time to go roughly to thermal equilibrium before the right - handed neutrinos go out - of - equilibrium due to their masses .",
    "we namely simply have no problem with getting too many gravitinos because gravitinos do not exist at all in our scheme .",
    "another `` unusual '' feature of our model is that the dominant contribution to the baryogenesis comes from the right - handed neutrinos . in our model",
    "it could be arranged without any troubles that the two heaviest right - handed neutrinos have masses only deviating by @xmath98 namely given by our vev parameters @xmath99 .",
    "this leads to significant enhancement of the @xmath100 and @xmath101 which is crucial for the success of our prediction .",
    "there is namely a significant wash - our taking place , by a factor of the order of @xmath102 .",
    "it is remarkable that we have here worked with a model that order of magnitudewise has with only six adjustable parameters been able to fit all the masses and mixings angles for quarks and leptons measured so far , including the jarlskog @xmath38 violation area and most importantly and interestingly the baryogenesis in the early universe . to confirm further our model we are in strong need for further data  which is not already predicted by the standard model , or we would have to improve it to give in principle accurate results rather than only orders of magnitudes .",
    "the latter would , however , be against the hall mark of our model , which precisely makes use of that we can guess that the huge amount of unknown coupling constants in our scheme with lots of particles can be counted as being _ of order unity_.",
