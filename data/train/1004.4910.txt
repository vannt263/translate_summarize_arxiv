    "the cosmological relevance of local starbursts is due to their similarities with their analogs at high redshift .",
    "they may therefore provide extremely valuable laboratories to study with high resolution and sensitivity relevant physical processes associated with the starburst activity in much better detail .",
    "one of the most suitable environments for these purposes can be the intriguing class of very compact , extremely star - forming galaxy ( sfg ) at low redshift ( @xmath3 ) recently discovered by volunteers in the `` galaxy zoo '' project @xcite .",
    "these galaxies , popularly referred to as `` green peas '' ( hereafter gps ) , were first reported and studied at some length by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter c09 ) , who classified more than one hundred of them .",
    "the gps are rare objects , located in lower - density environments and spectroscopically characterized by very faint continuum emission and strong optical emission lines , namely [ oiii]@xmath45007 , with an unusually large equivalent width of up to @xmath01000 .",
    "these properties along with their extreme compactness ( unresolved in sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) imaging ) are the reason for their green colors and point - like appearance in the sdss plates . according to c09 ,",
    "gps are low - mass galaxies ( stellar masses @xmath5@xmath010@xmath6 to 10@xmath7@xmath8 ) with extremely high star formation rates ( sfrs up to 30 @xmath8 yr@xmath9 ) , as derived from their emission lines and uv luminosity .",
    "therefore , their specific sfrs ( ssfrs , i.e. , sfr per unit of mass ) are among the highest inferred in the nearby universe .",
    "the gp properties are then consistent with the picture of galaxy downsizing @xcite , where the sites of active star formation shift from high - mass galaxies at early times to lower mass systems at later epoch ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the motivation for this letter was one of the most striking results obtained by c09 : the nearly constant solar metallicity of the gps ( log[o / h]+12@xmath08.7 in median ) over more than two orders of magnitudes in stellar mass .",
    "these results would imply strong constrains to the nature of gps and their evolutionary status . in this letter",
    "we examine in more detail the gp chemical abundances , namely oxygen and nitrogen , and their relation with the stellar mass , using the same sdss spectra but a different methodology than in c09 .",
    "this analysis indicates instead , that gps can be considered as a genuine population of metal - poor galaxies .",
    "the results are compared with a larger sample of local sfgs from the sdss and with a smaller sample of super compact uv - luminous starburst galaxies @xcite placed at the same redshift range of the gps . in particular ,",
    "the position of gps in the fundamental relation between mass and metallicity is discussed in the context of their starburst activity and feedback processes .",
    "the sample of galaxies was taken from the list of c09 .",
    "they compiled and analyzed by means of sdss data release 7 ( sdss dr7 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) imaging and spectroscopy , _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ optical and _ galex _ uv imaging , a well - defined sample of gps in the redshift range @xmath10 based on color selection criteria . from their list",
    "we selected a sub - sample of 79 gps spectroscopically classified as star - forming systems ( their table  4 ) , ruling out active galactic nuclei ( agns ) according to the diagnostic diagram [ nii]/h@xmath11  versus [ o iii]/h@xmath12  @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to c09 for a complete description of the sample selection .",
    "we obtained the full set of calibrated one - dimensional spectra , i.e. , _ spspec fits _",
    "files , from the sdss archive using the sdss dr7 query tools .",
    "the sdss spectra cover 3800@xmath139200  and the fiber has a 3@xmath14 diameter which , due to the compactness of the galaxies , include @xmath270% of the gp @xmath15band emission , which is the fraction of the fiber total light ( line+continuum ) within the fiber aperture ] .",
    "emission - line integrated fluxes were consistently measured for each galaxy spectrum using the iraf task _ splot _ , by summing all the pixels of the emission line after a linear subtraction of the continuum .",
    "the flux uncertainties are then calculated as    @xmath16    @xcite , where @xmath17 is the line flux uncertainty , @xmath18 is the uncertainty in the position of the continuum , @xmath19 is the number of pixels in the flux measurement , @xmath20 is the equivalent width of the line and @xmath21 is the wavelength dispersion . in most cases the measurements are in agreement with those based on gaussian fitting .",
    "physical properties and oxygen and nitrogen ionic abundances were calculated from the measured emission lines using the direct method , which is expected to provide more accurate abundances compared to strong - line methods ( see * ? ? ? * hereafter pmc09 ) .",
    "first , we have estimated the reddening constant from the h@xmath11/h@xmath12  ratio using the extinction curve of @xcite .",
    "then , for those objects with a reliable measurement of the [ o iii ] @xmath4 4363 emission line ( @xmath0 70% of the sample ) , we have derived the [ o iii ] electron temperature .",
    "the [ oii ] electron temperature has been derived from it using the relations proposed by pmc09 .",
    "o@xmath22 , o@xmath23 , and n@xmath22 ionic abundances have been calculated using these temperatures and the relative intensities of the corresponding brightest emission lines .",
    "finally , total o / h and n / o abundance ratios have been obtained with the usual expressions ( see pmc09 ) .    for the full sample , including those galaxies with no direct determination of the temperature , oxygen total abundances have also been estimated from the strong - line calibrator n2 @xmath24 .",
    "we have used the empirical relation derived by pmc09 , which gives oxygen abundances fully consistent with those derived from @xmath25-sensitive methods over the whole observed range of metallicity . according to these authors",
    ", n2 has a non - negligible dependence on the n / o ratio .",
    "nevertheless , our calculations indicate that correction for this dependence in this sample does not reduce the dispersion , so we have preferred to keep the calculated abundances in the non - corrected form .",
    "regarding n / o , this can be derived using the n2s2 parameter ( i.e. , [ nii]/[sii ] ) , minimizing its dependence on reddening or flux calibration .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     in figure  [ fig3 ] , we studied the stellar mass@xmath26metallicity relation ( @xmath27 , mzr ; * ? ? ? * ) and the relation between n / o and the stellar mass ( @xmath28n / o ; pmc09 ) for the gps , lbas , and sdss sfgs .",
    "estimates of @xmath5 for the three galaxy samples have been taken from c09 ( gps ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lbas ) , and the mpa@xmath26jhu catalog ( sfgs ) .",
    "they were derived using spectral energy distribution fitting and sdss photometry .",
    "thus , stellar masses are expected to to be consistent within a typical dispersion of @xmath0 0.20 dex ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this value , is lower than the expected uncertainties of 0.3 dex quoted for gps and lbas as due to uncertainties in their star formation history ( c09 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the @xmath28z plane ,",
    "sdss sfgs show a clear positive trend which flattens toward higher masses and show a relatively large scatter at lower masses , in agreement with previous findings for local galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , gps and lbas increase their metallicity with increasing masses .",
    "nevertheless , gps lie more than a factor of 2 ( @xmath2 0.3 dex ) below the mzr of sdss sfgs , i.e. _ at a fixed stellar mass gps are systematically more metal - poor than normal sfgs_. a similar shift in the mzr has been observed for the less massive ( log(m@xmath29 ) lbas ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* this work ) . in terms of stellar mass ,",
    "the observed offset ( as large as 1 dex ) largely exceeds the typical uncertainty quoted for the gp masses .    on the other hand , the sdss sfgs display a correlation between n / o and @xmath5 , with higher n / o ratios at higher stellar masses , in agreement with pmc09 for a different sample of local sfgs .",
    "the existence of the @xmath28n / o relation reflects the fact that the most massive galaxies evolve more quickly and , hence , they should have on average higher metallicities and n / o ratios . though the scatter in the @xmath28n / o relation is large , most gps and low - mass lbas are roughly consistent with the trend of sdss sfgs , and no systematic offset is observed .",
    "the shape of the mzr in galaxies has been found to depend on several key processes in galaxy evolution , including the efficiency of star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the action of metal - rich selective outflows and metal - poor gas inflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the possible variations in the initial mass function @xcite .",
    "moreover , different amounts of dark matter can also assist in some of these mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the gps follow a relation between mass and metallicity that parallels the mzr defined by the sdss sfgs , but is offset @xmath20.3  dex to lower metallicities .",
    "interestingly , we find some remarkable similarities between the gps and the population of [ o iii]-selected galaxies of similar luminosity in the @xmath30 range 0.290.42 recently found by @xcite .",
    "these galaxies follow a luminosity@xmath26metallicity relation that parallels the one defined by sfgs , but is offset by a factor of more than 10 to lower abundances . on the other hand , since gps and low - mass lbas lie in a similar offset position in the mzr relative to normal sfgs , their mentioned similarities appear even greater .",
    "one possibility to explain their offset position in the mzr is that these galaxies could be still converting a large amount of their cold gas reservoirs into stars . in that case , their low abundances could be due to their relatively young ages compared to normal sfgs . in the same range of masses , both gps and lbas have much higher ssfr ( typically @xmath3110@xmath32yr@xmath9 ) compared to other sfgs of similar mass ( c09 ) .",
    "recent studies show that galaxies with higher ssfrs or larger half - light radii for their stellar mass have systematically lower metallicities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , we have found even greater under - abundances in the gps , which have high ssfrs but are extremely compact .",
    "some models show that in highly concentrated ( typical sizes @xmath333  kpc ) low - mass galaxies such as the gps , galactic winds induced by their large ssfr are strong enough to escape from their weak potential wells , diminishing the observed global abundances ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , analytical models by @xcite show that any subsequent star formation to the outflow will remove their effects on metallicity , unless galaxies have an inefficient star formation .",
    "smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) plus @xmath19-body simulations have shown that low star formation efficiencies , regulated by supernova ( sn ) feedback , could be primarily responsible for the lower metallicities of low - mass galaxies and their overall trend in the mzr @xcite .",
    "as shown by @xcite for sfgs at @xmath34 , the constancy in the offset of the mzr suggests the presence of selective metal - rich gas loss driven by sn winds .",
    "inflow of metal - poor gas , either from the outskirts of the galaxy or beyond , can dilute metals in the galaxy centers , explaining an offset to lower abundances in both the mzr @xcite and the n / o  o / h diagram .",
    "in starburst galaxies , a recent cold gas accretion can be due to interactions , which eventually increases the gas surface density and consequently the star formation .",
    "as explained by @xcite , the dilution of metals due to an inflow can be restored by the effects of star formation depending on the dilution - to - dynamical timescale ratio . since this ratio depends inversely with galaxy radius , galaxies with smaller radius , such as the gps ,",
    "may be expected to take longer time to enhance their oxygen abundances to the values expected from the mzr . in this line , the position of gps in the @xmath28n / o relation and the offset observed in the n / o  o / h plane may favor this scenario .",
    "models by @xcite have shown that the rapid decrease of the oxygen abundance during an episode of massive and rapid accretion of metal - poor gas is followed by a slower evolution which leads to the closed - box relation , thus forming a loop in the n / o  o / h diagram .",
    "the inflow hypothesis is also strongly suggested by the disturbed morphologies and close companions observed in spatially resolved _",
    "images for three gps and most lbas ( c09 ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent results revealed that galaxies involved in galaxy interactions fall @xmath20.2 dex below the mzr of normal galaxies due to tidally induced large - scale gas inflow to the galaxies central regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several @xmath19-body / sph simulations have shown that major interactions drive starbursts and gas inflow from the outskirts of the h i progenitor disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , also supporting this scenario .",
    "we conclude arguing that recent interaction - induced inflow of gas , possibly coupled with a selective metal - rich gas loss driven by sn winds , may explain our findings and the known galaxy properties .",
    "nevertheless , further work is needed to constrain this possible scenario",
    ". in particular , future assessment of the h i gas properties and the star formation efficiency of gps , as well as the behavior of effective yields with mass compared with models of chemical evolution , will shed new light on the relative importance of the above processes .",
    "our results allow us to further constrain the evolutionary status of the gps .",
    "these galaxies , as well as the low - mass lbas and the [ o iii]-selected galaxies by @xcite should be analyzed and compared in more detail to elucidate whether these rare objects are sharing similar evolutionary pathways . even if this is not the case ,",
    "their properties suggest that these galaxies are snapshots of an extreme and short phase in their evolution .",
    "they therefore offer the opportunity of studying in great detail the physical processes involved in the triggering and evolution of massive star formation and the chemical enrichment processes , under physical conditions approaching those in galaxies at higher redshifts .",
    "forthcoming analysis , based on high s / n intermediate / high - resolution spectroscopy and deep nir imaging with the gran telescopio canarias ( gtc ) , will be used to better constrain the evolutionary status of the gps .",
    "we are very grateful to p. papaderos , m. moll and y. tsamis for very stimulating discussions and useful suggestions to improve this manuscript .",
