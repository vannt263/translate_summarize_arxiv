    "hoava has suggested that nature may exhibit lifshitz - like anisotropic scaling in the extreme ultraviolet ( uv ) regime in order to cure the divergence problem in quantum gravity @xcite . if gravity were to behave this way , then presumably all other interactions should also . in this paper , we shall show that lifshitz scalar field theories can support stable , finite - energy soliton or defect solutions of a kind that are impossible in standard second - order lorentz - invariant field theories .",
    "specifically , we shall demonstrate that stable , static , finite - energy defects formed entirely from scalar fields can exist in three dimensions .",
    "we shall derive both point - like and string - like solitons , which we can call `` lifshitz poles ( l - poles ) '' and `` lifshitz strings ( l - strings ) '' , respectively .",
    "the non - existence of solutions having all of the above characteristics in standard field theories follows from derrick s theorem @xcite .",
    "so , while point - like ( `` hedgehog '' ) and global string solutions do exist in standard theory , they have divergent energies or linear energy densities , as the case may be .",
    "the discovery of l - poles and/or l - strings as cosmological relics from the early universe would provide observational proof of the breakdown of standard field theory at short distances .",
    "the basic idea of lifshitz theories is to add high - order spatial derivative terms to the action while maintaining time derivatives at second order .",
    "this procedure preserves unitarity , while softening uv divergences through the presence of higher powers of 3-momentum in the denominators of propagators .",
    "this is an interesting idea , because it increases the range of power - counting renormalisable field theories .",
    "hoava gravity @xcite is the best - studied example ; field - theory models involving extra dimensions of space is another @xcite .",
    "the improved uv behaviour comes at the expense of lorentz invariance , with the uv isotropic scaling of lorentz - invariant field theories replaced by anisotropic scaling between space and time .",
    "this is obviously the most serious drawback of this approach , in both a phenomenological and an aesthetic sense .",
    "it is not known how to ensure that standard relativity emerges in the infrared , except by fine - tuning , though progress has recently been made on the gravity front @xcite . more generally , it is neither clear how to ensure that all particle species acquire a common limiting speed , nor how to make the renormalisation group running of the limiting speed(s ) phenomenologically acceptable @xcite .",
    "so , there are arguments both for and against lifshitz theories of particle physics and gravity .",
    "experimental or observational evidence in favour of the breakdown of lorentz invariance in the uv would lend support to the lifshitz approach .",
    "such evidence can be searched for in very high energy cosmic ray events , but also through the possible existence of cosmological relics that would be inexplicable by standard field theory .",
    "we shall examine lifshitz theories having fourth - order spatial derivatives , which is the simplest possible choice from the point of view of the differential equations .",
    "in general , these theories are much more difficult to analyse than the usual second - order relativistic theories .",
    "however , a lifshitz analogue of the bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) @xcite superpotential approach can be invoked to reduce the problem back to second - order ( this is equivalent to the `` detailed balance '' condition @xcite ) .",
    "we shall take this approach in this paper , partly for simplicity , and partly because the bps system has intrinsic theoretical interest through a deep connection with supersymmetry and stochastic quantisation .    in the next section we review lifshitz",
    "scalar field theory and anisotropic scaling .",
    "we then show why derrick s theorem is inapplicable .",
    "this is followed by the derivation of lifshitz bps soliton solutions , and then a brief section on the general fourth - order system .",
    "the final section is a conclusion .",
    "we shall work exclusively in @xmath2 dimensions .",
    "the construction of a lifshitz theory begins through the specification of the dynamical critical exponent @xmath4 , @xmath5 which defines the anisotropic scaling invariance of the theory in the uv .",
    "lorentz - invariant theories must have isotropic scaling , namely @xmath6 .",
    "consider now the case of @xmath3 , adopted for definiteness and simplicity in our analysis .",
    "we shall construct the action step - by - step .",
    "one first chooses that the lagrangian contains only the term @xmath7 in time derivatives .",
    "this is to ensure the unitarity of the quantum theory .",
    "anisotropic @xmath3 scale invariance then follows with the observation that the action @xmath8 is invariant under @xmath9 or , equivalently , under the field substitution @xmath10 without the coordinates in the integration measure and derivatives participating in the transformation .",
    "we shall adopt the viewpoint of eq .",
    "( [ eq : zeq2scaling ] ) for definiteness in this paper .",
    "the @xmath7 action is actually invariant for any @xmath4 , with the field transforming as @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath4 value is specified through the spatial - derivative terms we now introduce .",
    "the relativistic choice , @xmath12 , enforces @xmath6 .",
    "but we are interested in @xmath3 , which implies that @xmath13.\\ ] ] the arbitrary constant in front of the second term has been absorbed into @xmath14 , and the minus sign is necessary to make the energy bounded from below .",
    "the higher spatial derivative implies that the propagator behaves like @xmath15 $ ] , so has improved uv behaviour compared to the relativistic case @xmath16 .",

    "the power - counting renormalisation properties follow from the adoption of these new units , with the usual rule that renormalisable terms have either dimensionless or positive - power coupling constants , corresponding to marginal and relevant operators , respectively .",
    "the scale - invariant action ( [ eq : scaleinvs ] ) contains only marginal operators .",

    "there is no necessity for this quantity to be negative , hence there is no generalisation of derrick s theorem to the @xmath3 lifshitz case .",
    "a simple example is the case @xmath52 which implies @xmath53 and hence a positive second - order variation .",
    "another is @xmath54 , which sees @xmath55 turn into an integral of the negative - definite function @xmath56 after integration by parts .",
    "this makes @xmath51 necessarily positive .",
    "the addition of higher - derivative terms thus tends to stabilise scalar - field solitons , a phenomenon also observed in the ( relativistic ) skyrme model @xcite .",
    "however , evasion of derrick s theorem does not prove that stable , static , finite - energy , scalar - field solitons actually exist , because the variation ( [ eq : derrickvar ] ) is not general .",
    "we therefore turn to explicit computations .",
    "a technical problem with @xmath3 lifshitz theory is that the scalar field equations are fourth - order in spatial derivatives , as per eq .",

    "we shall derive three kinds of solutions : a perturbatively - stable non - topological point - like soliton , a topological point - like soliton or hedgehog , and a topological string . in the section after this",
    ", we shall also briefly discuss the general fourth - order problem , and display a finite - energy solution by way of an existence proof , but defer a systematic treatment to future work .",
    "we first very briefly review how superpotential considerations lead to interesting simplifications in one - dimensional second - order systems , with @xmath33 =   \\int dx \\left [ \\frac{1}{2 } \\left ( \\frac{d\\phi}{dx } \\right)^2 + v(\\phi ) \\right].\\ ] ] for the special cases where @xmath57 with @xmath58 being a superpotential , it is easy to see that @xmath33 = \\mp \\left [ w\\left(\\phi(x = + \\infty)\\right ) - w\\left(\\phi(x = -\\infty)\\right ) \\right ] + \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty } dx\\ , \\left ( \\frac{d\\phi}{dx } \\pm \\frac{dw}{d\\phi } \\right)^2.\\ ] ] since the integrand above is positive definite , solutions to the first - order equations @xmath59 globally minimise the energy functional for given boundary conditions .",
    "they are stable bps solutions , and it is trivial to confirm that they satisfy the euler - lagrange equations .",

    "the convenience of the action ( [ eq : supers ] ) is that the energy functional , @xmath33 = \\int d^3x \\ , \\left [ \\frac{1}{2 } \\dot{\\phi}^2 + \\frac{1}{2 } \\left ( \\nabla^2\\phi + k(\\phi ) \\right)^2 \\right],\\ ] ] is positive definite .",
    "configurations that obey @xmath63 minimise the energy , and in fact they have zero energy-_density_. it is straightforward to confirm that solutions of eq .",
