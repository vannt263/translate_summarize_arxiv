    "@xcite on the other hand , the magnetic susceptibility shows a spin - singlet like behavior below @xmath16 ; all the susceptibilities along the three crystallographic axes , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , exhibit a steep decrease below @xmath16 , in spite of the fact that @xmath20 and @xmath21 are perpendicular susceptibilities .",
    "@xcite although the opening of a spin gap and charge gap in the ordered phase seems to be associated with this phase transition ,  @xcite the detailed mechanism has not yet been clarified .",
    "it is also anomalous that the ordered moment aligns along the @xmath14 axis regardless of the single ion anisotropy of @xmath23 in the paramagnetic state .",
    "furthermore , the direction of the ordered moment can be tuned by introducing various kinds of perturbation such as magnetic field and atomic substitution .",
    "@xcite it is currently interpreted that a strongly anisotropic @xmath14-@xmath15 hybridization plays an important role in determining the direction of the ordered moment .",

    "high space resolution of synchrotron x - rays is also an advantage , which has been successfully utilized in this work in detecting the shift of the peak position at @xmath9 . on the other hand ,",
