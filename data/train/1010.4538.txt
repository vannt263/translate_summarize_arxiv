    "in order to make easier the following considerations , it is necessary to stress the differences between a continuous problem , for example ( [ hamilode ] ) , and a discrete problem obtained by applying to it a whatever numerical method . the main difference between them , very often underrated by many authors , is the lack of continuity in time .",
    "the latter does not affect many aspects such as , e.g. , the study of the qualitative behavior of solutions around asymptotically stable critical points ( stability analysis ) .",
    "in fact , the respective theories , with minor changes , are very similar ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . as a consequence",
    ", many tools , already devised in the continuous analysis , can be transferred to the discrete analysis almost unchanged .",
    "this is the case , for example , of the linearization around asymptotically stable critical points , which has been extensively used in the numerical analysis of methods for differential problems ( linear stability analysis ) .",
    "there are , however , other aspects for which continuity plays an essential role .",
    "for example , two solutions of the continuous problem need to stay away from each other while , in the discrete case , they may interlace ( without having common points , of course ) .",
    "this fact has many mathematical and even physical implications ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we shall deal with another case in which continuity plays an essential role .",
    "it regards the role of symplecticity which is central in discussing energy conservation in continuous hamiltonian problems , while it is less crucial in the energy conservation of discrete problems .",
    "this depends on the interplay between infinitesimal contact transformations and the need of infinite processes ( number of iterations ) which can not be operatively used in numerical analysis .",
    "this question has been already discussed in previous papers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . here , after a rapid introduction to the subject , we shall focus on a particular aspect , although very important , which concerns a property of the numerical methods , in the general class of collocation methods , which comes out by no more requiring symplecticity but still providing conservation of the hamiltonian functions on a subset of points of the mesh .",
    "clearly , this permits to avoid the drift of energy experienced when using many numerical methods proposed in the recent literature .    with this premise ,",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : in section  [ chp ] we recall the basic facts about canonical hamiltonian problems and the approaches used for their numerical solution ; one of them , resulting in the recently introduced class of _ hamiltonian boundary value methods ( hbvms ) _ , is then sketched in section  [ hbvms ] ; in section  [ iso ] we state the main result of this paper , concerning the _ isospectral property _ of such methods ; in section  [ coll ] such property is further generalized to study the existing connections between hbvms and runge - kutta collocation methods ; a few concluding remarks are finally given in section  [ fine ] .",
    "canonical hamiltonian problems are in the form @xmath0    where @xmath1 is a skew - symmetric constant matrix , the hamiltonian @xmath2 is assumed to be sufficiently differentiable , and the state vector splits into two blocks , @xmath3 , @xmath4 where , for mechanical systems , @xmath5 denote the positions and @xmath6 the ( generalized ) momenta .",
    "such problems are of great interest in many fields of application , ranging from the macro - scale of celestial mechanics , to the micro - scale of molecular dynamics .",
    "they have been deeply studied , from the point of view of the mathematical analysis , since two centuries .",
    "their numerical solution is a more recent field of investigation , where the main difficulty in dealing with them numerically stems from the fact that the meaningful isolated critical points of such systems are only marginally stable : neighboring solution curves do not eventually approach the equilibrium point either in future or in past times .",
    "this implies that the geometry around them critically depends on perturbations of the linear part .",
    "consequently , the use of a linear test equation , which essentially captures the geometry of the linear part , whose utility has been enormous in settling the dissipative case , can not be of any utility in the present case .",
    "it is then natural to look for other properties of hamiltonian systems that can be imposed on the discrete methods in order to make them effective .",
    "the first property which comes to mind is the symplecticity of the flow @xmath7 associated with .",
    "this property can be described either in geometric form ( invariance of areas , volumes , etc . ) or in analytical form : @xmath8 in one way or the other , it essentially consists in moving _ infinitesimally _ on the trajectories representing the solutions .",
    "infinitesimally means retaining only the linear part of the _ infinitesimal time displacement _ @xmath9 .",
    "it can be shown that this produces new values of the variables @xmath10 @xmath11 which leave unchanged the value of the hamiltonian @xmath12 ( _ infinitesimal contact transformation _ ( ict ) , see @xcite ) . consequently , since the composition of such _ infinitesimal _ transformations maintains the invariance , so does an _ infinite number _ of them .",
    "it is not surprising that the first numerical attempts to design conservative methods have tried to transfer similar arguments to discrete methods , i.e. to design symplectic integrators @xcite ( see also the monographs @xcite for more details on the subject ) .",
    "a backward error analysis has shown that symplecticity seems somehow to improve the long - time behavior properties of the numerical solutions .",
    "indeed , for a symplectic method of order @xmath13 , implemented with a constant stepsize @xmath14 , the following estimation reveals how the numerical solution @xmath15 may depart from the manifold @xmath16 of the phase space , which contains the continuous solution itself : @xmath17 where _",
    "@xmath18 is sufficiently small _ and @xmath19 .",
    "relation implies that a linear drift of the energy with respect to time @xmath20 may arise .",
    "however , due to the presence of the exponential , such a drift will not appear as far as @xmath21 : this circumstance is often referred to by stating that _ symplectic methods conserve the energy function on exponentially long time intervals _ ( see , for example , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 8.1 , p.367 ) ) .",
    "this is clearly a surrogate of the definition of stability in that the `` good behaviour '' of the numerical solution is not extended on _ infinite _ time intervals .",
    "as matter of fact , since symplecticity requires an _ infinite _ sequence of _ infinitesimal contact transformations _ it can not be transferred _",
    " sic et simpliciter \" _ to the discrete methods , simply because infinite processes are not permitted in numerical analysis",
    ". a more efficient approach would require to design methods which avoid the necessity of using infinite processes while preserving the constant of motion , i.e. , yielding a numerical solution belonging to the manifold @xmath16 .",
    "in this paper we consider a recently introduced class of methods of any high order that provide energy conservation .",
    "more specifically , with any given order , one can associate an infinite sequences of methods , differing from each other for the number of internal mesh points that cover the same time window , say @xmath22 $ ] : the more points we include , the better the conservation properties of the method .",
    "however , we show that , at least for polynomial hamiltonian functions , such a process of increasing the number of internal points is not infinite .",
    "in fact we show that there exists a finite value of new added points starting from which the method become conservative , whatever is the stepsize @xmath14 used .",
    "the evolution of the approaches to the problem , i.e. to get efficient energy - conserving methods , has been slow . as a matter of fact",
    ", the first unsuccessful attempts to derive energy - preserving runge - kutta methods culminated in the wrong general feeling that such methods could not even exist @xcite .",
    "one of the first successful attempts to solve the problem , outside the class of runge - kutta methods , is represented by _ discrete gradient methods _ ( see @xcite and references therein ) which are second order accurate .",
    "purely algebraic approaches have been also introduced ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , without presenting any energy preserving method .",
    "a further approach was considered in @xcite , where the _ averaged vector field method _ was proposed and shown to conserve the energy function , although it is only second order accurate . as was recently outlined in @xcite ,",
    "approximating the integral appearing in such method by means of a quadrature formula ( based upon polynomial interpolation ) yields a family of second order runge - kutta methods .",
    "these latter methods represent an instance of energy - preserving runge - kutta methods for polynomial hamiltonian problems : their first appearance may be found in @xcite , under the name of _ @xmath23-stage trapezoidal methods_. additional examples of fourth and sixth - order conservative runge - kutta methods ( for polynomial hamiltonians of suitable degree ) were presented in @xcite .",
    "all such energy - conserving methods have been derived by means of the new concept of _ discrete line integral_.    the evolution of this idea eventually led to the definition of _ hamiltonian boundary value methods ( hbvms ) _",
    "@xcite , which is a wide class of methods able to preserve , for the discrete solution , polynomial hamiltonians of arbitrarily high degree ( and then , a _",
    "practical _ conservation of any sufficiently differentiable hamiltonian ) . in more details , in @xcite hbvms defined at lobatto nodes have been analysed , whereas in @xcite hbvms defined at gauss - legendre abscissae have been considered . in the last reference , it has been actually shown that both formulae are essentially equivalent to each other , since the order and stability properties of the methods turn out to be independent of the abscissae distribution , and both methods are equivalent , when the number of the so called _ silent stages _ tends to _ infinity_. in this paper this conclusion is further supported , since we prove that hbvms , when cast as runge - kutta methods , are such that the corresponding matrix of the tableau has the nonzero eigenvalues coincident with those of the corresponding gauss - legendre formula ( _ isospectral property _ of hbvms ) .",
    "this property will be also used to further analyse the existing connections between hbvms and runge - kutta collocation methods .",
    "the arguments in this section are worked out starting from those used in @xcite to introduce and analyse hbvms . starting from the canonical hamiltonian problems ( [ hamilode ] ) , the key formula which hbvms rely on , is the _ line integral _ and the related property of conservative vector fields : @xmath24    for any @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is any smooth function such that @xmath27    here we consider the case where @xmath28 is a polynomial of degree @xmath23 , yielding an approximation to the true solution @xmath29 in the time interval @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "the numerical approximation for the subsequent time - step , @xmath31 , is then defined by ( [ sigma ] ) . after introducing a set of @xmath23 distinct abscissae , @xmath32    we set @xmath33    so that @xmath28 may be thought of as an interpolation polynomial , interpolating the _ fundamental stages _",
    "@xmath34 , @xmath35 , at the abscissae ( [ ci ] ) .",
    "we observe that , due to ( [ sigma ] ) , @xmath28 also interpolates the initial condition @xmath36 .",
    "[ c0 ] sometimes , the interpolation at @xmath37 is explicitly required .",
    "in such a case , the extra abscissa @xmath38 is formally added to ( [ ci ] ) .",
    "this is the case , for example , of a lobatto distribution of the abscissae @xcite .",
    "let us consider the following expansions of @xmath39 and @xmath28 for @xmath40 $ ] : @xmath41    where @xmath42 is a suitable basis of the vector space of polynomials of degree at most @xmath43 and the ( vector ) coefficients @xmath44 are to be determined .",
    "we shall consider an orthonormal polynomial basis on the interval @xmath45 $ ] ( though , in principle , different bases could be also considered @xcite ) : @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the kronecker symbol , and @xmath48 has degree @xmath49 .",
    "such a basis can be readily obtained as @xmath50    with @xmath51 the shifted legendre polynomial , of degree @xmath49 , on the interval @xmath45 $ ] ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we shall also assume that @xmath2 is a polynomial , which implies that the integrand in is also a polynomial so that the line integral can be exactly computed by means of a suitable quadrature formula .",
    "it is easy to observe that in general , due to the high degree of the integrand function , such quadrature formula can not be solely based upon the available abscissae @xmath52 : one needs to introduce an additional set of abscissae @xmath53 , distinct from the nodes @xmath52 , in order to make the quadrature formula exact : @xmath54    where @xmath55 , @xmath35 , and @xmath56 , @xmath57 , denote the weights of the quadrature formula defined at the abscissae @xmath58 .",
    "then , according to @xcite , we give the following definition .",
    "[ defhbvmks ] the method defined by the polynomial @xmath28 , determined by substituting the quantities in into the right - hand side of , and by choosing the unknown coefficient @xmath44 in order that the resulting expression vanishes , is called _ hamiltonian boundary value method with @xmath59 steps and degree @xmath23 _ , in short _ hbvm(@xmath59,@xmath23 ) _ , where @xmath60 .    according to @xcite , the right - hand side of",
    "is called _ discrete line integral _ associated with the map defined by the hbvm(@xmath59,@xmath23 ) method , while the vectors @xmath61    are called _ silent stages _ :",
    "they just serve to increase , as much as one likes , the degree of precision of the quadrature formula , but they are not to be regarded as unknowns since , from and ( [ hyi ] ) , they can be expressed in terms of linear combinations of the fundamental stages ( [ yi ] ) .",
    "because of the equality , we can apply the procedure described in definition [ defhbvmks ] directly to the original line integral appearing in the left - hand side . with this premise , by considering the first expansion in , the conservation property reads @xmath62    which , as is easily checked , is satisfied if we impose the following set of orthogonality conditions : @xmath63    then , from the second relation of we obtain , by introducing the operator @xmath64,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    that @xmath26 is the eigenfunction of @xmath65 relative to the eigenvalue @xmath66 : @xmath67    according to @xcite , ( [ l ] ) is called the _ master functional equation _ defining @xmath26 : it characterizes hbvm@xmath68 methods , for all @xmath69 .",
    "indeed , such methods are uniquely defined by the polynomial @xmath26 , of degree @xmath23 , the number of steps @xmath59 being only required to obtain the exact quadrature formula ( [ discr_lin ] ) .",
    "to practically compute @xmath26 , we set ( see ( [ yi ] ) and ( [ expan ] ) ) @xmath70    where @xmath71 inserting into yields the final formulae which define the hbvms class based upon the orthonormal basis @xmath72 : @xmath73    for sake of completeness , we report the nonlinear system associated with the hbvm@xmath68 method , in terms of the fundamental stages @xmath74 and the silent stages @xmath75 ( see ( [ hyi ] ) ) , by using the notation @xmath76    it represents the discrete counterpart of , which may be directly retrieved by evaluating , for example , the integrals in by means of the ( exact ) quadrature formula introduced in : @xmath77    from the above discussion it is clear that , in the non - polynomial case , supposing to choose the abscissae @xmath78 so that the sums in ( [ hbvm_sys ] ) converge to an integral as @xmath79 tends to _ infinity _ , the resulting formula is , which has been named _",
    "@xmath80-hbvm of degree @xmath23 _ or _",
    "hbvm@xmath81 _ in @xcite .",
    "this implies that hbvms may be as well applied in the non - polynomial case since , in finite precision arithmetic , hbvms are undistinguishable from their limit formulae , when a sufficient number of silent stages is introduced , so that a _ practical _ energy conservation is obtained , for @xmath59 large enough @xcite . on the other hand , we emphasize that , in the non - polynomial case , becomes an _ operative method _ only after that a suitable strategy to approximate the integrals appearing in it is taken into account . in the present case ,",
    "if one discretizes the _ master functional equation _ ( [ lf])([l ] ) , hbvm@xmath68 are then obtained , essentially by extending the discrete problem ( [ hbvm_sys ] ) also to the silent stages ( [ hyi ] ) . in more details , by using ( [ fy ] ) and introducing the following notation : @xmath82 y_i = \\sigma(t_0+\\tau_ih ) , & & f_i = f(\\sigma(t_0+\\tau_ih ) ) , \\qquad i=1,\\dots , k,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the discrete problem defining the hbvm@xmath68 method becomes , @xmath83    by defining the vectors  @xmath84   and  @xmath85 ,   and the matrices @xmath86 whose @xmath87th entry are given by @xmath88    we can cast the set of equations ( [ hbvmks ] ) in vector form as @xmath89    with an obvious meaning of @xmath90 .",
    "consequently , the method can be regarded as a runge - kutta method with the following butcher tableau : @xmath91 in particular , when a gauss distribution of the abscissae @xmath92 is considered , it can be proved that the resulting hbvm@xmath68 method @xcite ( see also @xcite ) :    * has order @xmath93 for all @xmath69 ; * is symmetric and perfectly @xmath94-stable ( i.e. , its stability region coincides with the left - half complex plane , @xmath95 @xcite ) ; * reduces to the gauss - legendre method of order @xmath93 , when @xmath96 ; * exactly preserves polynomial hamiltonian functions of degree @xmath97 , provided that @xmath98",
    "we are now going to prove a further additional result , related to the matrix appearing in the butcher tableau ( [ rk ] ) , i.e. , the matrix @xmath99    whose rank is @xmath23 .",

    "when @xmath110 , from the orthonormality of the basis , see ( [ orto ] ) , and considering that the quadrature with weights @xmath107 is exact for polynomials of degree ( at least ) @xmath108 , one obtains that ( see ( [ oip])([idpo ] ) ) for all  @xmath35   and  @xmath111 , @xmath112 and , therefore , @xmath113 by taking into account the result of lemma  [ intleg ] , one then obtains : @xmath114    with the @xmath115 defined according to ( [ xij ] ) .",

    "the eigenvalues of @xmath117 are those of @xmath118 ( see ( [ xs ] ) ) and the zero eigenvalue .",
    "then , also in this case , the nonzero eigenvalues of @xmath94 coincide with those of @xmath118 , i.e. , with the eigenvalues of the matrix defining the gauss - legendre method of order @xmath93 .",
    "it turns out that such methods , in the form here presented ( i.e. , having chosen the polynomial basis ( [ orto1 ] ) ) , can be regarded as a generalization of gauss methods , in the sense that , they share the same nonzero spectrum , for all @xmath69 . in the limit @xmath119 , the same essential spectrum is retained by the limit operator ( see ( [ l ] ) ) . in the case of a polynomial hamiltonian ,",
    "such sequence of methods starts to be energy - preserving for a finite value of @xmath59 .",
    "moreover , even though for a general hamiltonian the method becomes energy - preserving in the limit @xmath119 , nevertheless , when using finite precision arithmetic , the limit is practically obtained for a finite value of @xmath59 , namely as soon as full machine precision accuracy is achieved .",
    "by using the previous results and notations , we now further elucidate the existing connections between hbvms and runge - kutta collocation methods .",
