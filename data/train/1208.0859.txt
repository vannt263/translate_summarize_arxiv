    "given an homeomorphism @xmath0 of the torus @xmath1 which is in the homotopy class of the identity , and a lift @xmath2 of @xmath0 to the universal covering , one can associate to @xmath3 its rotation set @xmath4 , a convex and compact subset of the plane consisting of all the limit points of sequences of the form @xmath5 , with @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this definition was introduced by misiurewicz and ziemian in @xcite as a generalization of the rotation number for circle homeomorphisms , and has proved to be a useful tool in the study of the dynamics of these homeomorphisms . in particular , when the rotation set has nonempty interior it has been shown that @xmath0 exhibits very rich dynamics , with an abundance of periodic points and positive topological entropy @xcite .",
    "but this complex behavior is not restricted to rotation sets with nonempty interior : there are several examples of homeomorphisms with rich dynamical properties such that their rotation set is a singleton .    in this work",
    "we are concerned with the interplay between transitivity of @xmath0 , transitivity on the universal covering space and rotation sets .",
    "our motivation in studying transitivity on the universal covering space is to understand when it is possible for the dynamical system to exhibit this form of extreme transitivity , where there exist trajectories that are not only dense on the surface , but also explore all possible loops and directions .",
    "this is a strictly more stringent concept , as ergodic rotations of the @xmath8-torus do not lift to transitive homeomorphisms of the plane .",
    "there have been some prior works concerning transitivity of the lifted dynamics of surface homeomorphisms . in @xcite",
    ", boyland defines @xmath9-transitivity for a surface homeomorphism as the property of having an iterate which lifts to the universal abelian covering as a transitive homeomorphism , and he characterized @xmath9-transitivity for rel pseudo - anosov maps .    in @xcite",
    "it was proven that a @xmath10 diffeomorphism of @xmath11 homotopic to the identity and with positive entropy has a rotation set with nonempty interior if @xmath0 has a transitive lift to a suitable covering of @xmath11 . in @xcite and @xcite , homeomorphisms of the annulus with a transitive lift",
    "were studied , and it was shown that if there are no fixed points in the boundary then the rotation set of the lift contains the origin in its interior .    more relevant to this work is the result from @xcite , where it is shown that if @xmath0 is a homeomorphism of @xmath11 homotopic to the identity which has a transitive lift @xmath3 to @xmath12 , then the origin lies in the interior of @xmath4 .",
    "our main result is the converse of this fact :    [ th : transitivoemcima ] let @xmath0 be a transitive homeomorphism of @xmath11 homotopic to the identity , and let @xmath13 be a lift of @xmath0 to @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath14 belongs to the interior of @xmath4 then @xmath13 is transitive .",
    "note that , since the fundamental group of @xmath11 is abelian , the notion of @xmath9-transitivity ( as defined in @xcite ) in the case of a homeomorphism @xmath0 of @xmath11 is equivalent to saying that some iterate of @xmath0 has a lift to @xmath12 which is transitive . as an immediate consequence of theorem [ th : transitivoemcima ] together with the main result of @xcite , we have a characterization of @xmath9-transitive homeomorphisms of @xmath11 in the homotopy class of the identity :    a homeomorphism of @xmath11 in the homotopy class of the identity is @xmath9-transitive if and only if it has ( a lift with ) a rotation set with nonempty interior .    the key starting point for the proof of theorem [ th : transitivoemcima ] is a recent result from @xcite that rules out the existence of ` unbounded ' periodic topological disks .",
    "after this , the theorem is reduced to a technical result , theorem [ th : maintheorem ] , the proof of which is obtained from geometric and combinatorial arguments relying on a well - known theorem of franks about realization of rational rotation vectors by periodic points @xcite and some classic facts from brouwer theory .",
    "the next section states these preliminary facts and introduces the necessary notation . in section 3 ,",
    "theorem [ th : maintheorem ] is stated , and its proof is presented after using it to prove theorem [ th : transitivoemcima ] .",
