    "models on triangulated surfaces can be classified into two groups .",
    "one of them is the fluid model which is defined on dynamical connectivity surfaces @xcite , and the other is the tethered model on fixed connectivity surfaces @xcite .",
    "there is another classification of surface models ; a model is called real or phantom according to whether the surface is self - avoiding or not .",
    "the phantom model is still interesting because the self - avoiding interaction is considered to be irrelevant in the limit @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "we consider that the phase structure of the tethered surface model remains to be studied further .",
    "it has been recognized that the phantom tethered model undergoes a second - order phase transition both on a sphere @xcite and on a disk @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it has also been reported that there is a first - order transition in the model with hamiltonian slightly different from the ordinary one of helfrich and polyakov - kleinert on a sphere @xcite .",
    "first - order transitions can also be seen in a model of nambu - goto hamiltonian with a deficit angle term @xcite and in a model with hamiltonian containing the gaussian term and an intrinsic curvature term @xcite .",
    "therefore , phase transitions of the tethered surface model should be understood more clearly .    in this article",
    ", we would like to investigate the dependence of the phase transition on the existence of boundary in the surface .",
    "for this purpose , we define the model on a triangulated disk , which is topologically identical with a sphere with a hole , the disk is obtained by dividing the hexagon .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by a linear combination of the gaussian term and an intrinsic curvature term ; intrinsic curvatures in membranes have no direct analog in one dimensional objects like linear polymer as noted in @xcite .",
    "it was reported that the model with intrinsic curvature undergoes a first - order transition on a sphere @xcite as mentioned above .",

    "the intrinsic curvature @xmath11 at the internal vertices can also be different from those at the boundary one on fluctuating surfaces due to the same reason for @xmath3 .",
    "these differences of @xmath3 and @xmath11 between the internal and the boundary vertices are the one we can not find in compact surfaces such as a sphere .",
    "we comment on a relation of @xmath11 in ( [ s3 ] ) to an intrinsic curvature energy @xmath29 in @xcite .",

    "we clearly see from the figures that the convergence speed in the smooth phase is about 10 times larger than that in the crumpled phase .",
    "the reason why the convergence speed in the smooth phase is so larger than in the crumpled phase is that the phase space volume ( @xmath67 ) , where the vertices @xmath15 take their values , is relatively larger in the smooth phase than that in the crumpled phase .",
