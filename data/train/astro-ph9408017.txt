    "<S> in recent years there has been a developing realization that the interesting large  scale structure of voids ,  pancakes \" , and filaments in the universe is a consequence of the efficacy of an approximation scheme for cosmological gravitation clustering proposal by zeldovich in 1970 . </S>",
    "<S> however , this scheme was only supposed to apply to smoothed initial conditions .    we show that this can be explained by the fact that the gravitationally evolved potential from n  body simulations closely resembles the smoothed potential of the initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting  hierarchical pancaking \" picture effectively combines features of the former soviet and western theoretical pictures for galaxy and large  scale structure formation .    </S>",
    "<S> = .75truein </S>",
    "<S> = .75truein    .25 in    over the last forty years , it has been realized that galaxies are clustered in space , which is measurable by a two  point correlation function@xcite . during the last twenty years , it has become clear that the distribution has a rich , frothy structure of voids , filaments , and sheets@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> gravitational instability is the dominant theory for explaining the development of clumpy structure in the hot big bang cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> yet there is a problem in accounting for all the coherent anisotropic structure .    in 1970 </S>",
    "<S> zeldovich@xcite proposed an approximation for clustering which is essentially inertial motion in comoving coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> specialized to critical density models , it is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the ( eulerian ) position , @xmath2 is the initial ( lagrangian ) coordinate , @xmath3 is the scale factor of the universe , and @xmath4 is a velocity potential related by a constant factor to the gravitational potential @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> divergence in @xmath5 is prevented by of doing the convention change of variables to density contrast @xmath6 as the source term for the poisson equation . </S>",
    "<S> the pseudo  newtonian treatment of cosmological gravitational clustering has recently been put on a firm footing    in spite of the general success of the gravitational instability picture , there is no ready explanation for the coherence of large scale structure , i.e superclusters . </S>",
    "<S> the zeldovich approximation ( za ) does predict such structures@xcite , but za depends on the assumption of long  range coherence of the gravitational potential ( otherwise particles should be deflected from their trajectories by very small  scale inhomogeneities ) . </S>",
    "<S> theories with smoothed initial conditions , such as  hot dark matter \" , apparently have trouble making any structures in voids , which results in an excessive correlation amplitude@xcite .    hierarchical clustering models , which have initial density fluctuations on all scales , are more generally successful . </S>",
    "<S> such models are typically specified by the power spectrum of density fluctuations @xmath7 where the @xmath8 are fourier components . </S>",
    "<S> power laws @xmath9 are useful for theoretical analysis and discussion . </S>",
    "<S> the most favored models today have @xmath10 for small @xmath11 , possibly a relic of inflation , and turn over gradually to negative @xmath12 at large @xmath11 , depending on the matter contents of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> such models usually are based on collisionless dark matter .    in spite of the fact that these theories do not have smoothed initial conditions , evidence began accumulating from numerical simulations that they produced interesting large  scale anisotropic structures . as this became an accepted feature of such models , an explanation was developed based on the adhesion approximation . </S>",
    "<S> this explanation contains the correlation length of @xmath5 as a crucial feature , and consequently identifies @xmath13 as a transitional power law .    </S>",
    "<S> however , this argument must be incomplete . </S>",
    "<S> use of za can predict structure very well if the initial conditions are smoothed , removing small - scale initial power . </S>",
    "<S> the best smoothing appears to be gaussian convolution around the scale of nonlinearity@xcite more recently , a detailed study of the behavior of the approximation ( which we call tza for truncation of the spectrum , to distinguish it from za ) over a range @xmath14 has been made with surprising results@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the performance of tza degrades as @xmath12 increases but is still quite good even for the extreme case @xmath15 ; it is far better than conventional eulerian linear perturbation theory for example . </S>",
    "<S> one can use the initial conditions to predict the location and orientation of filament  like objects with considerable accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> n  body simulations appear to be no longer necessary for most spectra of interest if one is satisfied with resolving galaxy group mass scales [ 12 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> an explanation is now possible for the unreasonable utility of tza ; more detail is presented elsewhere [ 13 ] . </S>",
    "<S> because the growth of fluctuation amplitude compenstates for expansion , the peculiar gravitational potential evolves to linear order such that @xmath5 is constant . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss for changes beyond linear order .    in figure 1 </S>",
    "<S> we show the initial and nonlinear evolved potential along a diagonal of each of four simulation cubes . </S>",
    "<S> we did power  </S>",
    "<S> law n  body simulations with @xmath12 = 3 , 1 , + 1 , and + 3 . </S>",
    "<S> these are 128@xmath16 pm simulations@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the moment chosen is that when the scale of nonlinearity has grown to @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the fundamental mode of the cube .    </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath12 = 3 and 1 the evolved potential is very close to the initial , as expected from trivial considerations ( the power spectrum of the potential is @xmath19 , so long waves dominate ) . for @xmath20 and @xmath21 </S>",
    "<S> there is no real resemblance between the potentials , although the eye can detect some correlation for @xmath20 .    </S>",
    "<S> computation of the coherence length of the potential shows that it is largely unchanged by evolution for @xmath22 and @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> however it grows by a factor of more than 7 for @xmath20 and @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> ( in both cases the number should be larger ; we are resolution limited , especially for + 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> adhesion arguments are based on coherence of the initial potential , and so missed making the prediction in the latter two cases .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us compare the evolved potential to the smoothed initial potential . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown in figure 2 with a scale change for clarity . </S>",
    "<S> there is a strong resemblance , decreasing with @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear from this that modestly nonlinear evolution ( up to @xmath24 from linear extrapolation ) can be accurately described by constant gravitational potential with increasing smoothing . </S>",
    "<S> we have crosscorrelated the initial with the final potential . </S>",
    "<S> there is a significant signal , increasing predictably as @xmath12 decreases . </S>",
    "<S> modes @xmath25 are known to grow linearly </S>",
    "<S> . however , when we smooth the initial potential by gaussian convolution , there is an enormous increase in signal , verifying the visual impression of comparing figures 1 and 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the smoothing windows found to work best for tza [ 12 ] were used for this comparison . in the table </S>",
    "<S> we show further information . </S>",
    "<S> more details on this and other detailed comparisons between the simulations at tza are given elsewhere [ 13 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the very strong resemblance of the nonlinear potential to the smoothed initial potential explains why tza works so well over such a wide range of spectral indices . </S>",
    "<S> the clumps which have formed by hierarchical clustering are moving in a background potential which is close to a smoothed version of the initial . </S>",
    "<S> also , adhesion and other approximations are limited@xcite by their use of the initial potential . </S>",
    "<S> even for @xmath12 = 1 we find some improvement by smoothing . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that a new class of second  order approximation schemes can be constructed which go beyond za but use the smoothed potential .    </S>",
    "<S> the universe possesses a rich large  scale structure because gravitational clustering smooths the potential . </S>",
    "<S> this is a somewhat counter  intuitive result , but there have been precursor hints , for example based on the topology of large  </S>",
    "<S> scale structure@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the smoothed and linearly evolved density field manifestly does not resemble the nonlinear density field@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hierarchical clustering ( largely developed in the west ) is a good description of small  scale clumping and gives reasonable results for galaxy formation [ 2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> however , the motion of the clumps is driven by the smoothed potential , which brings into play all the machinery developed by the  moscow school \" during the 70 s and 80 s [ 6 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that a unified picture of galaxy and large  scale structure formation can now emerge . </S>"
