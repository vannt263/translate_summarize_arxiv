    "many open problems and important theorems in low - dimensional topology , including the classification theory of topological 4dimensional manifolds and the study of knots and links in 3manifolds , have been formulated in terms of statements about smooth maps of certain 2complexes called _ gropes_. as suggested by its name , a grope is built inductively from layers of surfaces which `` reach into '' a 4manifold in an attempt to approximate an embedded 2disk .",
    "the existence of generically embedded 2disks in dimensions greater than 4 allows for use of the whitney move , a vital part of the surgery programs which yield classification theorems for higher dimensional manifolds and knotted submanifolds .",
    "the failure in general of the whitney move in dimension 4 is a defining characteristic of low - dimensional topology and this paper describes a precise correspondence between gropes and an approximation to the whitney move via certain `` towers '' of iterated whitney disks .",
    "a whitney move eliminates a pair of singularities between immersed surfaces in a 4manifold but will also create new intersections if the guiding whitney disk contains singularities in its interior .",
    "a _ whitney tower _ is constructed by pairing such singularities in the interiors of whitney disks with `` higher order '' whitney disks in an attempt to find embedded whitney disks via `` higher order '' whitney moves ( figure  [ w - tower5-fig ] and section  [ w - tower - sec ] ) .",
    "the _ order _ of a whitney tower ( definition  [ w - tower - defi ] ) is determined by the number of layers of whitney disks added to the immersed surfaces and the _ class _ of a grope ( figure  [ class4gropea - fig ] and definition  [ grope - defi ] ) measures its complexity in terms of the number of its layers or _ stages _ of surfaces .    in the case of gropes ,",
    "all singularities are usually contained in _ caps _ which are 2disks that are mapped in after all stages of embedded surfaces have been attached .",
    "the caps are attached along essential curves called _ tips _ ( details in section  [ grope - sec ] ) .",
    "the correspondence between class and order is described by the following basic version of our main result :    [ class - order - thm ] for any collection of embedded closed curves @xmath2 in the boundary of a 4manifold @xmath3 , the following are equivalent :    1 .",

    "the @xmath2 bound properly immersed 2disks @xmath5 admitting an order @xmath6 whitney tower @xmath7 in @xmath3 .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ class - order - thm ] is given by a local construction meaning that , given caps for the @xmath4 , the @xmath5 and @xmath7 are constructed in a neighborhood of the capped gropes @xmath8 and , given the @xmath5 contained in @xmath7 , the gropes @xmath4 ( and caps ) are constructed in a neighborhood of @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , a much more precise correspondence between gropes and whitney towers can be described in terms of unitrivalent trees ( [ grope - trees ] , [ int - point - trees ] ) which capture the essential structure of both gropes and whitney towers .",
    "this correspondence is given in theorem  [ tower - to - grope - thm ] and theorem  [ grope - to - tower - thm ] , which are stated and proved in section  [ sec : thms ] ( and directly imply theorem  [ class - order - thm ] ) . the key element used in the proofs of these theorems and their corollaries is that the associated trees , embedded as subsets of the gropes and whitney towers , can be preserved and controlled during modifications such as ambient surgery or whitney moves .",
    "[ rem : tau ] besides providing an interpretation of gropes in terms of whitney disks , the notion of whitney towers comes equipped with an obstruction theory that generalizes the usual ( first order ) intersection theory for surfaces in 4manifolds .",
    "the associated invariants @xmath9 take values in graded groups of trees which generalize the well - known target groups of finite type concordance invariants of links .",
    "these higher order intersection trees are enhancements of the trees discussed in this paper and are used in @xcite to give a geometric description of milnor s @xmath10invariants and the ( reduced ) kontsevich integral for links .",
    "( see also @xcite and @xcite . )",
    "it should be noted that the whitney towers described here differ from the towers that appear in the theory of casson handles ( @xcite , @xcite ) in that the latter always involve killing the so - called `` accessory circles '' that run through the singularities .",
    "the gropes that arise in the context of casson handles are certain capped",

    "gropes whose singularities are restricted to intersections among the caps ( @xcite ) .",
    "the notion of whitney tower described here _ is _ related to general symmetric gropes ( without restrictions on caps ) and the recently discovered filtration of the classical knot concordance group in terms of _ n - solvability _ by cochran , orr and teichner @xcite : a whitney tower of _ height _ @xmath0 ( resp .",

    "the translation between gropes and whitney towers can be helpful in understanding connections between algebraically and geometrically defined filtrations .",
    "this is the case in the next two corollaries which are proved by applying a geometric `` ihx '' jacobi relation to manipulate the trees associated to a whitney tower ( lemma  [ ihx - lemma ] ) .    in analogy with the fact that the @xmath0th term of the lower central series of a group is generated by _",

    ".    in the case of knots in @xmath18 , it was shown constructively in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that the arf invariant is the only obstruction to the existence of a ( half)-grope concordance of arbitrarily high class .",
    "thus , the von neumann signatures of @xcite which obstruct @xmath0-solvability are obstructions to `` inverting '' the geometric manipulations of gropes and whitney towers via geometric ihx constructions ( as used , for instance , in the proof of corollary  [ cor : half - grope ] above ) to convert class into height .",

    "in fact , the proof yields a stronger conclusion as described in section  [ sec : k - slice ] .",
    "( the same proof also shows more generally that class @xmath28 grope concordance implies @xmath1-cobordism . )",
    "although closely related , whitney towers are slightly more general objects than gropes as is suggested by the association of _ rooted _ trees to gropes and _ un_rooted trees to whitney towers .",
    "this generality is conducive to defining geometric invariants associated to an obstruction theory ( as mentioned in remark  [ rem : tau ] ) as well as manipulating the shape of gropes ( as in corollaries  [ cor : half - grope ] and [ cor : k - slice ] above ) .",
    "however , in certain constructions it is useful to convert whitney towers into gropes , for instance to take advantage of nice properties of embedded grope complements .",

    "the relevant graphs in 4dimensions are the unitrivalent trees which occur here naturally in the context of whitney towers .",
