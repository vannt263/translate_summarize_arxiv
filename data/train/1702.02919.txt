    "the simplest and first way to argue that if critical bond percolation on the square lattice possesses a conformally invariant scaling limit ( which is a strong assumption  recall that proving this is still an open question ) , then the scaling limit of the interfaces has to be the schramm - loewner evolution ( sle@xmath0 ) with parameter @xmath12 was due to schramm @xcite in 1999 and it can be sketched as follows .",
    "first , the usual argument involving the conformal markov property shows that the scaling limit of interfaces would have to be an sle@xmath0 path for some @xmath13 , so that it remains to pin down the actual value of @xmath6 .",
    "one simple property that allows one to do so is that if one considers an sle@xmath0 in a square from the bottom left corner to the top left corner , then one can compute the probability that it hits the right - hand side of the square along the way .",
    "it turns out that @xmath14 is the only value for which this probability is equal to @xmath15 . on the other hand , for discrete critical bond percolation on a ( quasi)-square @xmath16 \\times [ 0 , n]$ ] portion of the square grid",
    ", duality shows that the probability that there exists a left - to - right open crossing ( which means that the discrete percolation interface analog of the previous sle@xmath0 will hit the right - hand side of the square ) is equal to @xmath15 for all @xmath17 .",
    "one can then conclude that sle@xmath18 is the only possible candidate for a conformally invariant scaling limit of the percolation interface .",
    "note that sle@xmath18 also possesses other properties ( see for instance the locality property derived in @xcite ) that also imply that it is the only possible conformally invariant scaling limit for critical percolation without even referring to any discrete crossing probability , but the above argument is already short , direct and convincing . recall that in order to prove that percolation is indeed conformally invariant in the scaling limit , and that discrete percolation interfaces do converge to sle@xmath18 , a lot of further work is required .",
    "see the work of smirnov @xcite for the case of the triangular lattice ( and for instance @xcite for a survey of the proof of the convergence of interfaces ) .",
    "two of the most natural and classical classes of discrete models that are supposed to give rise to sle curves in the scaling limit are the o(@xmath4 ) models ( both the dense and the dilute versions ) and the critical bond fk(@xmath5)-percolation models ( we will briefly recall the definition of these models in appendix  [ app1 ] ) .",
    "on planar lattices , exactly three of these models have been proved to indeed converge to an sle - based scaling limit : the ising model ( which is the o(@xmath19 ) model , where the interfaces converge to sle@xmath20 paths ) , the fk - percolation models for @xmath21 ( this is the fk model related to the ising model , where the interfaces converge to sle@xmath22 paths )  see @xcite and the references therein , or @xcite for a survey ) , and the fk(@xmath5)-percolation model in the limit @xmath23 ( this is the uniform spanning tree model , where its boundary peano curve converges to sle@xmath24 ) ",
    "see @xcite .",
    "it has been conjectured ( see for instance @xcite ) , based on the identification between exponents , probabilities or dimensions that one can rigorously compute for sle processes on the one hand and the corresponding quantities that had been previously predicted from the methods of theoretical physics ( conformal field theory , quantum gravity or coulomb gas methods , see for instance @xcite ) for the asymptotic behavior of the discrete models on the other hand , that the o(@xmath4 ) models have a non - trivial and conformally invariant scaling limit for all @xmath25 $ ] and that this scaling limit should be related to sle@xmath0 curves for @xmath26 , where @xmath27 $ ] if one considers the dilute o(@xmath4 ) model and @xmath28 if one considers the dense o(@xmath4 ) model .",
    "similarly , the scaling limit of the critical fk(@xmath5)-percolation model interfaces should be non - trivial for @xmath29 $ ] and described by sle@xmath0 curves , for @xmath30 , where @xmath31 ( mind of course that @xmath32 is negative for all @xmath1 ) .",
    "recall that a cle@xmath0 ( conformal loop ensemble ) for @xmath1 is a particular random collection of loops in a simply connected planar domain such that the loops in a cle@xmath0 are sle@xmath0 type loops . while the sle@xmath0 curves can be argued ( via the conformal markov property ) to be the only possible conformally invariant scaling limit of single interfaces for a wide family of discrete interfaces for lattice models with well - chosen boundary conditions ( that involve choosing two special points on the boundary of the domain , and choosing one boundary arc to be `` wired ''",
    "while the other one is `` free '' ) , the cle@xmath0 can be argued to be the only possible conformally invariant scaling limit for the joint law of _ all _ of the macroscopic interfaces for the same models with `` uniform '' free boundary conditions . for the aforementioned lattice models ( fk(@xmath5)-percolation and o(@xmath4 ) ) , this has now been proved for the same cases as for individual interfaces , see @xcite )    the results of the present paper on cle@xmath0 connection probabilities provide a generalization of schramm s original argument for percolation that we outlined above to all of these models . more specifically , for all @xmath1",
    ", we will first explain how to define the law of a cle@xmath0 in a conformal rectangle , with `` wired '' boundary conditions on two opposite sides of the rectangle .",
    "the idea , is to start with the usual cle@xmath0 and to partially discover it starting from two boundary points ; in other words , our cle@xmath0 with free / wired / free / wired boundary conditions will be defined as a conditioned version of the usual cle@xmath0 ( even if one conditions on an event of zero probability ) .",
    "the wired portions of the boundary should be thought of as parts of to - be completed loops in this conditioned cle@xmath0 .",
    "then , for these cle@xmath0 with two wired boundary arcs , we will derive the probability that the two wired pieces are part of the same loop , as a function of @xmath6 and of the cross - ratio @xmath33 of the four corners of the conformal rectangle .",
    "in particular , we will see that :    [ mainprop ] consider @xmath1 and a cle@xmath0 with two wired boundary arcs in a square , where the boundary arcs are two opposite sides of the square .",
    "then , the probability that the boundary arcs hook up into one single loop is equal to @xmath34 .",
    "note that this connection probability ( we will also sometimes use equivalently the term hook - up probability ) in squares first decreases from @xmath19 to @xmath35 when @xmath6 increases from @xmath36 to @xmath37 ( this is the regime where the cle@xmath0 consists of simple disjoint loops ) , and then increases again from @xmath35 to  @xmath19 , when @xmath6 increases from @xmath37 to @xmath38 ( which is the regime of non - simple loops ) .",
    "hence , the hook - up probability in a square with the alternating boundary conditions is always at least @xmath35 .",
    "deriving theorem [ mainprop ] is the core of our paper and the proofs will make no reference to discrete models .",
    "it has nevertheless some implications about the conjectural relation between conformal loop ensembles and discrete models that we now briefly discuss : one can compare it with the fact that for discrete o(@xmath4 ) models ( on any lattice with some symmetries ) and for the critical fk(@xmath5 ) percolation model on @xmath39 , the corresponding discrete connection probabilities in squares ( or some other given symmetric shape if one considers a lattice other than @xmath39 ) are equal to @xmath40 and @xmath41 , independently of the size of the square , just because of a symmetry / duality argument ( we will recall this in appendix  [ app1 ] ) .",
    "this can be viewed as the natural generalization to those models of the crossing probability of squares feature of critical percolation ( which is the special case @xmath42 , and for percolation , boundary conditions do not matter ) .",
    "hence , one gets the following conditional results , that generalize schramm s 1999 statement for critical percolation and sle@xmath18 ( note also that theorem 7 in @xcite shows rigorously that if an fk(@xmath5)-model scaling limit for @xmath43 has a conformally invariant scaling limit , it would be boundary touching i.e. , the value of @xmath6 would have to be greater than @xmath37 ) :    * if a dilute o(@xmath4 ) model has a non - trivial and conformally invariant scaling limit consisting of simple loops , then necessarily @xmath25 $ ] and the scaling limit has to be cle@xmath0 for the value of @xmath27 $ ] such that @xmath44 .",
    "* if a dense o(@xmath4 ) model has a non - trivial and conformally invariant scaling limit consisting of non - simple loops , then necessarily @xmath25 $ ] and the scaling limit has to be cle@xmath0 for the value of @xmath45 such that @xmath44 . *",
    "if a critical fk(@xmath5)-model on @xmath39 has a non - trivial conformally invariant scaling limit , then necessarily @xmath29 $ ] and the scaling limit has to be cle@xmath0 for the value of @xmath45 such that @xmath30 .",
    "let us briefly discuss the relationship between the present contribution and some of the closely related results in the literature :    * connection probabilities and related questions for families of sle paths have been the focus of interesting mathematical work by dubdat , zhan , bauer - bernard - kytl and others ( see for instance @xcite and the references therein ) that is very much relevant and related to the present paper , and that we will in fact use .",
    "let us now very briefly explain how our contribution fits with respect to these references . in these papers , the main focus is on the description and classification of the joint law of `` commuting '' sle curves , that start from a number of boundary points of a simply connected domain ( these are dubdat s commutation relations ) . in the particular case where one looks at four boundary points @xmath46 and assumes that all of the sle curves are locally absolutely continuous with respect to sle@xmath0 curves for the same value of @xmath6 , these commutation relations allow one to describe all of the possibilities up until the curves hit .",
    "if one applies this to our precise setup , these results state that one has ( for each value of @xmath6 ) exactly a one - parameter family of possible candidates for the joint law of the four strands of our cle@xmath0 with two wired boundary conditions .",
    "basically , one has two extremal solutions such that for the first one , the strand started from  @xmath47 always ends up at  @xmath48 , while for the second one , it ends up at  @xmath49 ( in both these cases , the law of the pair of strands are also known under several names : intermediate sle processes , hypergeometric sles , or bichordal sle processes ) and in our setting , they describe the law of the strands , when one conditions on one ( or the other ) connection events .",
    "in particular , if one _ assumes _ the value of the connection probability in a square , then these commutation ideas provide the exact form of the connection probability in terms of the cross - ratio of the conformal rectangle ( and because this probability defines a martingales when one explores one strand , it also defines the exact description of the driving function of one strand ) , we will come back to this in section [ s2 ] .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to provide an actual computation of this connection probability in conformal squares for our wired / free / wired / free boundary conditions , uniquely via cle considerations and no conjectural relation to discrete models , which ( we believe ) is a new input . *",
    "the hook - up probability in squares can be derived by other means for some special values of @xmath6 : as we have already mentioned , the fact that it is @xmath15 for cle@xmath18 is a direct consequence of the special target - invariance properties of sle@xmath18 . the fact that the hook - up probability is also @xmath15 when @xmath50 can be viewed as a consequence of the fact that cle@xmath20 is the scaling limit the ising model @xcite because of the symmetries in the ising model ( this observation already appears in @xcite  at that time the case @xmath50 was a conditional result since it had not yet been established that the ising model converges to sle@xmath20 which is now established , see also the recent paper @xcite ) . similarly , the fact that the hook - up probability is @xmath51 in the special case where @xmath52 can in fact be viewed as a consequence of the fact @xcite that cle@xmath22 is proved to be the scaling limit of the fk(@xmath53 ) model ( see appendix [ app1 ] for why the crossing probability for this discrete model is @xmath54 ) .",
    "also , the fact that the hook - up probability tends to @xmath19 as @xmath55 and @xmath56 could be inferred directly from the brownian loop - soup description from @xcite for the @xmath55 case , and from the relation to uniform spanning trees when @xmath56 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "as we will explain in section [ sgff ] , the fact that the connection probability is @xmath35 in the case where @xmath57 can be worked out using the relation between cle@xmath58 and the gaussian free field . *",
    "the cle percolation approach that we developed with sheffield @xcite gives a continuous version of the relation between fk - percolation and the corresponding potts models in terms of conformal loop ensembles cle@xmath0 and cle@xmath59 . in @xcite , combining the results of @xcite with ideas from liouville quantum gravity ( lqg ) , we provide another way to get the relation @xmath60 out of cle@xmath0 considerations only ( this time without any reference to discrete crossing probabilities ) . note that this other cle / lqg approach does not directly yield the value of the connection probabilities or the relation to the dilute @xmath61 models , and that it is somewhat more elaborate than the present one .",
    "it is also related to the considerable progress that has been done in recent years in relating these questions to structures in random geometries / random maps ( that can be viewed as trying to put some of the theoretical physics considerations onto firm mathematical ground ) , see for example @xcite and the references therein .",
    "let us now make some further bibliographic comments on the conjectural relation with discrete models :    * it is interesting to see that the @xmath62 and @xmath63 thresholds for the nature of the phase transition of fk(@xmath5 ) percolation and o(@xmath4 ) models show up from this cle@xmath0 end , via the fact that the lowest possible cle@xmath0 hook - up probability in conformal squares is @xmath35 .",
    "note that @xmath62 has been recently proved ( rigorously and based on the study of discrete models ) to be the threshold for existence of a continuous phase transition for fk(@xmath5)-percolation models on @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite shows rigorously that the scaling limit of the critical fk(@xmath5 ) model s interfaces are trivial when @xmath64 ( which is of course a much stronger statement than the conditional `` then necessarily @xmath29 $ ] '' in the fk - part of our statement above ) . *",
    "as we have already mentioned , these relations between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and between @xmath4 and @xmath6 have appeared in numerous papers before .",
    "but , to the best of our knowledge , except for the specific particular cases of @xmath6 that we have already mentioned , they were not based on rigorous sle - type considerations . more precisely , the argument was the following : if these models have a conformally invariant scaling limit , then it must be described by an sle@xmath0 for some @xmath6 . in order to identify which value of @xmath6",
    "is the right one , they matched some computation of probabilities of events for sle ( or of critical exponents , or of dimensions ) with the corresponding values that were _ predicted _ to be the correct ones for the scaling limit of the discrete model , based on theoretical physics considerations ( see for instance @xcite for the fk(@xmath5 ) conjecture based on the physics dimension predictions ; another approach is related to the discrete parafermionic observable for fk models ",
    "see @xcite or @xcite for a detailed discussion and more references  , where the spin is defined as @xmath65 , and that is conjectured to correspond in the scaling limit to some sle martingale , see for instance @xcite ) . in the present paper",
    ", we identify the candidate value of @xmath6 using a feature that is rigorously known to hold in the discrete model ( and therefore in its scaling limit , if it exists ) .",
    "so , in a way , one could view it as an sle / cle derivation of the conjectural relation between the lattice models and the corresponding conformal field theory ( i.e. , a relation between the @xmath5 or @xmath4 and the central charge @xmath66 which can be derived via the sle restriction property @xcite or the loop - soup construction of cle @xcite ) .",
    "* in relation with the cle percolation item mentioned above , let us just stress that the relation @xmath67 between the values @xmath68 and @xmath69 that have the same connection probability is not at all the same as the @xmath70 duality relation between sle@xmath0 and sle@xmath71 from @xcite or the edwards - sokal coupling between cle@xmath0 and cle@xmath71 derived in @xcite .",
    "it is however possible to combine the present work or the results of @xcite with the cle percolation results of @xcite  this for instance indicates based on cle considerations only that if the scaling limit of the critical fk - percolation model for @xmath72 on @xmath39 is non - trivial and conformally invariant , then the scaling limit of the critical potts model for @xmath72 would exist as well and could be described in terms of cle@xmath0 for the value of @xmath27 $ ] such that @xmath73 i.e. , @xmath74 .",
    "let us describe the structure of the paper , and explain where we use which results from other papers :    in section  [ scle ] , we will first recall some background material about cles and their properties , and then define what we will call cle with two wired boundary arcs . as we will explain",
    ", this builds on the shoulders of some previous work : the definition and conformal invariance of cles for @xmath1 from @xcite , the exploration features of cle as studied in @xcite , and last but not least , the conformal invariance of hook - up probabilities as derived in @xcite .",
    "this is a section where we use directly and indirectly various background material from the family of papers that construct conformal loop ensembles and their basic properties .",
    "those readers who want to focus on the computational part of the derivation of theorem [ mainprop ] can choose to take the results of that section for granted .    in section  [ sgff ] , which can be viewed as a brief interlude , we explain how it is possible to prove theorem [ mainprop ] in the case where @xmath75 using the coupling between the gaussian free field and cle@xmath58 ( from @xcite , see also @xcite ) .    in section  [ s2 ]",
    ", we briefly survey what the aforementioned works on commutation relations @xcite do imply in our set - up of wired cles .    in section  [ smain ] ,",
    "we describe the main steps of our proofs of theorem [ mainprop ] , separately in the cases @xmath27 $ ] and @xmath76 , that allow us to reduce the determination of the connection probability to actual concrete estimates of probabilities of events that we then derive in sections  [ sproof1 ] and  [ sproof2 ] . in the case of simple cles , the arguments in section  [ smain ]",
    "will rely on the loop - soup construction of cle@xmath0 , and more specifically on the decomposition of loop - soup clusters and the relation to restriction measures , as studied in @xcite .",
    "the actual computations in sections  [ sproof1 ] and  [ sproof2 ] will involve some considerations involving sle and hypergeometric functions .",
    "we conclude with two short appendices , recalling very briefly some basics about o(@xmath4 ) models and their connection probabilities , and about the properties of hypergeometric functions that we are using in our proofs .",
    "let us quickly recall some features of conformal loop ensembles ( cle )  the reader may wish to consult @xcite for background and further references . for our purpose , it will be sufficient to focus on their non - nested versions .",
    "cle was defined in @xcite as the natural candidate that should describe the joint law of outermost interfaces in a number of critical models from statistical physics in their scaling limit .",
    "sheffield s construction is based on the target - invariance ( see @xcite ) of variants of sle@xmath0 , the sle@xmath77 processes that can be defined nicely for all @xmath1 ( when @xmath27 $ ] , one has to consider sle@xmath77 processes with either lvy compensation or side - swapping , because @xmath78 which corresponds to the dimension of a certain bessel process being strictly smaller than @xmath19 ; see @xcite for background ) .",
    "this property enables one to define for each simply connected domain @xmath79 and each boundary point @xmath80 , a branching tree of such processes , starting from @xmath80 and that target all points in @xmath79 .",
    "branches of the tree trace loops along the way , so that this branching tree defines a random collection of loops , that sheffield called cle@xmath0 .",
    "note that with this construction , the law of this cle@xmath0 seems to depend on the choice of the boundary point .    in order to prove that this law does not depend on the choice of @xmath80 and",
    "therefore prove that the cles constructed by sheffield are indeed a random collection of loops whose laws are invariant under the whole group of conformal automorphisms of @xmath79 , some non - trivial arguments are needed :    * when @xmath27 $ ] , which is the case where the cle loops are all disjoint and do not touch the boundary of @xmath79 , the proof in @xcite uses the brownian loop - soup in @xmath79 introduced in @xcite , which is a natural poisson point process of brownian loops in @xmath79 , with intensity given by a constant @xmath81 times a certain natural measure on brownian loops .",
    "note that the loops in a loop - soup can be thought of as being independent , so that they can overlap and therefore create clusters of brownian loops .",
    "the fact that the outer boundaries of loop - soup clusters would give rise to random collections of sle - type loops that behave nicely under perturbations of the domains that they are defined in had been outlined in 2003 @xcite . +",
    "as it turns out , it has then been proved in @xcite that in fact : ( a ) for all @xmath82 , if one considers the outermost boundaries of these brownian loop - soup clusters , one obtains a countable conformally invariant collection of mutually disjoint simple loops and ( b ) that for all @xmath80 , this collection of loops coincides with the cle@xmath0 defined by the branching tree construction .",
    "since the loop - soup construction of cle does not involve the boundary point @xmath80 , this therefore proves that the law of the cle@xmath0 defined by the branching tree construction is indeed independent of @xmath80 .",
    "the fact that one has these two different descriptions of the same cle@xmath0 ( via the brownian loop - soup or via branching sle@xmath77 processes ) is a very useful fact when one tries to derive further properties of the conformal loop ensembles , and in the present paper , we will in fact use both these constructions in our proofs .",
    "* when @xmath76 , some aspects of the branching sle@xmath83 tree are in some way simpler than for @xmath84 .",
    "this makes it possible to view the conformal invariance of the cle@xmath0 as a direct consequence of the reversibility of sle@xmath0 processes .",
    "this reversibility for non - simple sle paths is a non - trivial fact , that has been established in @xcite using the connection with the gaussian free field ( gff ) and more precisely via the `` imaginary geometry '' approach developed in @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details about the construction of cle@xmath0 for @xmath28 .    .",
    "the arrow indicates the `` inside '' part of the partially traced simple loop which corresponds to this wired part.,title=\"fig : \" ] .",
    "the arrow indicates the `` inside '' part of the partially traced simple loop which corresponds to this wired part.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the branching tree description defines immediately what one can refer to as cle@xmath0 with one wired boundary arc .",
    "suppose that one grows an sle@xmath77 process @xmath85 targeting some other boundary point @xmath86 ( for convenience , let us take the usual normalization where @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) , and that one stops this branch of the branching sle tree at a ( deterministic or stopping ) time @xmath90 , while it is in the middle of tracing a loop .",
    "we can then ask what is the conditional distribution of the cle@xmath0 in the unbounded connected component @xmath91 of @xmath92 $ ] .",
    "if we map back @xmath91 onto the upper half - plane via the usual conformal transformation @xmath93 normalized at infinity by @xmath94 , then the image @xmath95 of the tip of the curve is the driving point of the loewner chain @xmath96 , while the other end of the cle loop that one is currently tracing is mapped onto the marked point @xmath97 that one uses in order to define the sle@xmath77 process .",
    "the target - invariance and the properties of the conformal loop - ensembles immediately show that the image under @xmath93 of this conditional distribution can be described as follows ( this works for all @xmath98 ) :    * first finish the currently traced loop by sampling an ordinary sle@xmath0 in @xmath99 from @xmath96 to @xmath97 . * then sample independent cles in the connected components of the complement of the sle that are `` outside '' of the loop obtained by concatenating the sle with the segment from @xmath97 to @xmath96 .",
    "this description is valid for all @xmath1 and it is clearly a conformally invariant function of @xmath100 .",
    "this distribution is what we will call cle with one wired boundary arc ( here the wired boundary arc of @xmath99 is the compact segment between @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) . by conformal invariance ,",
    "this can then also be defined for any simply connected domain @xmath79 and boundary arc @xmath101 .",
    "examples are sketched in figure  [ pic3 ] in the case @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "as explained for instance in @xcite or @xcite , one can also use procedures other than the exploration tree to discover the loops of a cle@xmath0 in a `` markovian '' way .",
    "this includes for instance deterministic explorations such as discovering one after the other an in their order of appearance , all the cle loops that intersect a given deterministic curve that starts on the boundary ; for example in the unit disk , start from @xmath19 , and trace one after the other all loops that intersect the segment @xmath102 $ ] starting from @xmath19 , until one hits the imaginary axis .",
    "this last procedure will sometimes jump along the imaginary axis , but the cle property will ensure that the previously defined wired cle describes also the conditional law of the cle when one stops the exploration in the middle of a loop .",
    "such an exploration can be useful for @xmath103 $ ] because the it is a deterministic function of the cle ( which is actually not the case when @xmath104 for the branching tree , see @xcite ) .",
    "another important tool for us will be the recent results about the decomposition of brownian loop - soup clusters @xcite . in particular , we will use the following fact ( see @xcite ) : consider a cle@xmath0 @xmath105 for @xmath27 $ ] in the unit disk , that was obtained from a brownian loop - soup @xmath106 with intensity @xmath81 ( as explained in @xcite ) , and one starts an exploration from the boundary point @xmath107 and stops it at some time @xmath90 , when one is in the middle of tracing a loop .",
    "then , we have seen that in the remaining to be discovered domain @xmath108 , the conditional distribution of the cle is a wired cle , which is wired on the currently traced arc @xmath109 .",
    "it turns out that it is in fact possible to describe the following aspects of the conditional distribution of the loop - soup itself in @xmath108 .",
    "* the outer boundary of the union of all the brownian loops loops that do intersect @xmath109 form a restriction measure with exponent @xmath110 attached to this arc ( see @xcite for background and definitions about restriction measures ) . * the set of brownian loops in  @xmath108 that do not intersect @xmath109 form an independent loop - soup in  @xmath108 .",
    "a feature that is worth mentioning already and that follows from this last item , is that if we stop the exploration at a stopping time such that the exploration has not exited the @xmath111-neighborhood of @xmath107 , then this exploration will be independent of the set of brownian loops in the loop - soup that do not intersect this neighborhood .      in the case where @xmath76 , we recall that the sle@xmath77 process is a deterministic function of the cle@xmath0 that it constructs .",
    "it follows local deterministic rules in order to discover ( portions of ) the loops that intersect the boundary of the domain . as explained in @xcite , this makes it possible for a given realization of the cle in a simply connected domain , to choose two distinct boundary points , and to start discovering the cle from both points , and to stop the two explorations at some fixed or random stopping time .",
    "suppose that we follow this procedure and to choose to explore anticlockwise along the boundary ( tracing the loops clockwise ) for the first exploration , and to explore clockwise along the boundary ( tracing the loops anticlockwise ) for the second exploration , and that we stop them at some times during which they are both tracing loops and that they have not yet hooked up .",
    "denote the remaining to be explored domain by @xmath108 and the four marked boundary points ( corresponding to the special points of each of the explorations ) @xmath112 with obvious notations ( see figure  [ pic23 ] ) .",
    "then , as explained in lemma 3.1 of @xcite , the conditional distribution of the cle in @xmath108 is then conformally invariant with respect to the configuration @xmath113 .",
    "let us insist on the fact that this conformal invariance statement is not trivial to prove , even if it seems intuitively obvious ( one should keep in mind that the definitions of cle themselves are not straightforward at all ) .",
    "this is what we will refer to as the cle@xmath0 in @xmath108 with the wired arcs @xmath114 and @xmath115 .    when @xmath27 $ ] , the exploration tree that discovers cle@xmath0 loops is not a deterministic function of the cle ( it involves necessarily side - swapping when @xmath75 , and when @xmath116 , there is also a lot of randomness lying in the trunk of the sle@xmath77 exploration tree ",
    "see @xcite for all these facts ) .",
    "however , an important feature is that the trunk of an sle@xmath77 traces what we called a `` conformal percolation interface '' in the complement of the cle that is defined locally , which enables for a given cle , to launch two such explorations from two different boundary points , that are conditionally independent given the cle .    to be specific ,",
    "let us choose two given such sle@xmath77 explorations starting from two given boundary points , that are conditionally independent given the cle .",

    ". the main purpose of this paper will be precisely to determine this hook - up probability .",
    "before studying the general case , let us briefly explain how theorem  [ mainprop ] can be derived directly and easily when @xmath75 , using the relation between cle@xmath58 and the gff .",
    "recall that sle@xmath58 can be viewed as a level line of the gaussian free field @xcite .",
    "the corresponding coupling of cle@xmath58 with the gff was introduced in @xcite ( see also @xcite for details ) and can be described as follows : sample one cle@xmath58 in a simply connected domain @xmath79 , and toss an independent fair bernoulli coin @xmath134 for each cle loop @xmath135 . then , in the domains encircled by each of these loops , sample an independent gff @xmath136 with zero boundary conditions on @xmath135 ( the gff @xmath136 is equal to @xmath137 in the outside of @xmath135 ) . then , for a certain choice of @xmath138 , the field @xmath139 is exactly a gff in @xmath79 .",

    "suppose now that we explore the cle@xmath58 starting from two distinct boundary points in such a way that the two side - swapping sle@xmath141 explorations are conditionally independent given the cle@xmath58 ( this can for instance be done by using two independent i.i.d .",
    "collections @xmath142 and @xmath143 and to view the sle@xmath141 processes as deterministic functions of the two corresponding gffs , see @xcite and the references therein ) , and stop these two explorations along the way as described above . the conditional distribution of the cle@xmath58 in the remaining to be discovered domain is then given by the cle with two wired boundary arcs .",

    "this is also related to the fact that the hook - up probabilities that we will discuss in the next section take a very simple form in that case ( which was already observed in the aforementioned papers by dubdat or bauer - bernard - kytl ) .",
    "let us consider again the general case @xmath1 , and let us now review what the results on commutation relations from @xcite imply for our cles with two wired boundary arcs and for the hook - up probability as a function of the cross - ratio of the considered conformal rectangle .",

    "it is possible to see ( and this has been done using several methods ) that the law on pairs @xmath177 is uniquely characterized by this last property ( this is the resampling property of bichordal sle as studied and used in @xcite ) .",
    "this explains why @xmath181 will be fully determined once one knows the hook - up probability function @xmath169 and in fact , that it suffices to know the value of @xmath182 for one single value @xmath183 in order to deduce the entire function @xmath184 .",

    "considerations of this type are in fact included in some form in the papers cited above that introduce and study commutation relations for sle paths and their consequences ( note that these in fact actually study a somewhat more general class of questions  in the present setup , we for instance already know from the construction that our commuting strands will eventually hook - up and create one or two loops , which is a non - trivial feature ) . then , it follows from these arguments that @xmath184 is of the form @xmath186 for some positive @xmath187 , where @xmath188 and where here and in the remainder of this paper , @xmath189 will denote the hypergeometric function @xmath190 ( see for instance ( * ? ? ?",

    "<S> the goal of the present paper is to explain , based on properties of the conformal loop ensembles cle@xmath0 ( both with simple and non - simple loops , i.e. , for the whole range @xmath1 ) how to derive the connection probabilities in conformal rectangles for a conditioned version of cle@xmath0 which can be interpreted as a cle@xmath2 with wired / free / wired / free boundary conditions on four boundary arcs ( the wired parts being viewed as portions of to - be - completed loops ) . in particular , in the case of a conformal square , we prove that the probability that the two wired sides hook up so that they create one single loop is equal to @xmath3 .    comparing </S>",
    "<S> this with the corresponding connection probabilities for discrete o(@xmath4 ) models for instance indicates that if a dilute o(@xmath4 ) model ( respectively a critical fk(@xmath5)-percolation model on the square lattice ) has a non - trivial conformally invariant scaling limit , then necessarily this scaling limit is cle@xmath0 where @xmath6 is the value in @xmath7 $ ] such that @xmath8 is equal to @xmath4 ( resp . the value in @xmath9 such that @xmath10 is equal to @xmath11 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> our arguments and computations build on the one hand on dubdat s sle commutation relations ( as developed and used by dubdat , zhan or bauer - bernard - kytl ) and on the other hand , on the construction and properties of the conformal loop ensembles and their relation to brownian loop - soups , restriction measures , and the gaussian free field , as recently derived in works with sheffield and with qian .    </S>",
