    "the term `` active galactic nucleus '' ( agn ) reflects the fact that the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) powering an agn is normally found in the nucleus of its host galaxy because dynamical friction against the surrounding stars eventually drives any offset smbh to the bottom of the galaxy s gravitational potential well .",
    "however , the stellar bulge of nearly every massive galaxy contains a smbh @xcite , so heirarchical merging of galaxies should produce stellar bulges initially containing two or more smbhs that are offset in position and velocity . following a merger",
    ", a pair of inspiraling smbhs may spend @xmath11 at separations @xmath12",
    "@xcite before forming a tight binary that could either stall at @xmath13 separation or merge .",
    "anisotropic gravitational radiation emitted during a smbh merger may kick the merged smbh out of the nucleus into a nearly radial orbit with kpc size for up to @xmath14 before it settles down @xcite .",
    "recoiling smbhs on highly eccentric orbits spend most of their time with velocity offsets too small to detect spectroscopically , so @xcite suggested `` an alternative approach would be to search for linear displacements between the agn emission and the peak of the stellar surface brightness . ''",
    "finally , @xcite proposed the existence of `` wandering '' smbhs : `` if a galaxy is tidally disrupted before coalescence is completed , a possibility exists that its bh will remain naked '' for a few gyr .",
    "we have found what we believe is the first example of a nearly naked smbh in the surviving core of a tidally stripped galaxy .",
    "the discovery program that found the offset smbh is outlined in section  [ sec : finding ] .",
    "the radio , optical , and infrared identifications of the offset smbh and its host galaxy are presented in section  [ sec : identifications ] , and their long - slit optical spectra are described in section  [ sec : spectra ] .",
    "section  [ sec : interpretation ] gives our interpretation of the data in terms of a nearly naked smbh clothed only by the compact remnant of a radio galaxy that was tidally shredded by the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) in the cluster ( b1950 coordinate name ) .",
    "this cluster is usually called in the literature .",
    "to discover smbhs with small linear offsets from their host galaxy bulges , we need a large sample of nearby galaxies containing smbhs whose existence and positions are revealed by their compact @xmath15 radio emission .",
    "condon , broderick , & yin ( in prep ) compiled a sample of all two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) extended source catalog ( xsc ) galaxies @xcite north of @xmath16 , at galactic latitudes @xmath17 , and brighter than @xmath18 at @xmath19 , a wavelength at which luminosity is a good tracer of total stellar mass @xcite and dust extinction is small enough that the 2mass positions should be close to the bulge centroids .",
    "the xsc rms position errors are @xmath20@xmath21 in each coordinate , but we found that the 2mass point - source catalog ( psc ) fitted positions better locate the bulge centers with rms errors @xmath22 in each coordinate . at the typical angular - size distance @xmath23 of these bright galaxies , a @xmath24 projected linear offset yields an easily detectable angular offset @xmath25 .",
    "condon , yin , & broderick also identified the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) @xcite radio sources that have nvss/2mass position differences @xmath26 .",
    "we observed the stronger nvss identifications withq the very long baseline array ( vlba ) at x band ( @xmath3 , @xmath27 ) and we re - analyzed archival vlba data at 8.4 and 2.3  ghz in a large program covering 1215 radio sources with @xmath28 at @xmath29 to image the compact components powered by smbhs in or near bulge centroids ( petrov et al .",
    "2016 , in preparation ) .    the 2mass point - source catalog ( psc ) absolute radial position errors are rayleigh distributed with @xmath30 and our vlba absolute positions have @xmath31 , so smbhs offset by more than @xmath32 should be distinguished from nuclear smbhs with 99.9% reliability .",
    "the observed vlba minus psc offsets of smbhs detected before 2014 are consistent with the expected position uncertainties ( figure  [ fig : offsets ] ) , confirming that nearly all smbhs are truly nuclear .",
    "however , the compact flat - spectrum radio source ( b1950 coordinate name ) is offset by @xmath33 from the infrared source ( j2000 coordinate name ) .",
    "the bcg in zwcl  8193 is the 2mass galaxy 2masx  17171926 + 4226571 at psc position j2000 @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "its @xmath36 nvss counterpart at j2000 @xmath37 , @xmath38 is @xmath39 north of the bcg .",
    "this radio source was first detected at @xmath40 in the 408 mhz bologna b3 survey @xcite and named b3 1715 + 425 ( equinox b1950 iau format name ) .",

    "@xcite associated 87 gb 1715 + 4230 with the bcg in zwcl  8193 , for which they reported both a stellar absorption - line redshift @xmath44 and a significantly higher emission - line redshift @xmath45 . in a flat @xmath46cdm universe with @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 implies that the bcg in zwcl  8193 is at angular - size distance @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the corresponding luminosity distance is @xmath52 .    because zwcl  8193 is a bright x - ray source and `` emission - line nebulae are frequently found surrounding the central galaxy in clusters with cooling flows",
    ", '' @xcite believed `` that photoionization by an active nucleus or other activity associated with the radio emission is unlikely to be the principal mechanism for generating the line emission . ''",

    "@xcite presented an integral - field h@xmath53+[nii ] line - intensity image showing emission north of the bcg , but they did not discuss the radio source . @xcite first noted the compact radio source `` is 3 arcsec from the center of the bcg at the location of fuv - bright debris features and may be associated with a merging galaxy , '' but associated the diffuse ly@xmath53 emission with zwcl  8193 .",
    "thus the literature has remained unclear and the optical identification of b3  1715 + 425 is still listed as zwcl  8193 in the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",

    "we used eight of the ten vlba stations to reobserve b3 1715 + 425 in left circular polarization ( lcp ) at 7.6  ghz ( x band ) and 4.4  ghz ( c band , with the new wideband receiver for improved sensitivity ) simultaneously for 4 hours on 2013 december 6 .",
    "the missing stations were fd ( broken motor ) and kp ( no fringes for an unknown reason ) .",

    "the symmetric jets or lobes have the `` normal '' steep spectra @xmath77 of transparent synchrotron sources .",
    "we associate the central radio component with the apparent base of the jet near the smbh itself @xcite because of its compactness , high brightness temperature , and flat spectrum .",
    "its brightness temperature and spectrum are consistent with a self - absorbed synchrotron source having a nearly equipartition magnetic field strength , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "the radio source is too luminous and far too bright to be powered by anything but a smbh .",
    "all known star - forming galaxies have @xmath78 brightness temperatures @xmath79 @xcite .    the symmetric source in figure  [ fig : vlbax ]",
    "is @xmath80 in projected length , so b3  1715 + 425 may be a compact symmetric object ( cso ) as defined by @xcite .",
    "the two steep - spectrum components about @xmath81 from the core at position angles 60  and 245  can be interpreted as a weak jet and a counter - jet of approximately equal flux density , so they are not relativistically beamed .",
    "thus the line between them need not be close to the line of sight @xcite and their actual lengths probably are not much greater their projected lengths .",
    "@xcite noted that csos usually have compact self - absorbed cores with spectra peaking in the ghz frequency range , but these core sources are probably not relativistically boosted ( else triple csos would be outnumbered by misaligned coreless compact double sources in radio surveys ) , so their flux densities can be used to calculate their intrinsic brightness temperatures and luminosities .",

'' on this hst image , our gaussian fits give the bcg core position j2000 @xmath90 , @xmath91 and the circled object is at j2000 @xmath92 , @xmath93 , only @xmath94 from the vlba position .",
    "our vlba images reveal no radio emission brighter than 1  mjy  beam at the position of the bcg . first @xcite ( @xmath95 fwhm resolution ) does not resolve b3 1715 + 425 , and the first flux density @xmath96 equals the nvss ( @xmath97 fwhm resolution ) flux density @xmath98 , so b3 1715 + 425 has very little or no extended radio emission on angular scales between @xmath95 and @xmath97 .",
    "the @xmath99 angular separation between b3 1715 + 425 and the bcg is smaller than the first beam , so the bcg might be a fairly compact radio source , smaller than the first beam but large enough to be resolved out by the vlba . in that case , the first position of b3 1715 + 425 would be at the flux - weighted centroid of the bcg and vlba positions .",
    "the first declination is only @xmath100 south of the vlba declination while the bcg and vlba positions are separated by about @xmath99 , so the bcg likely contributes @xmath101% to the total flux density of b3 1715 + 425 .",
    "we conclude that the correct optical identification of the radio source b3 1715 + 425 is _ only _ the circled object , and not the bcg nucleus @xmath102 to the south or other tidal debris .",
    "the 2masx infrared source is a marginally significant @xmath103 north of the optical bcg nucleus , which is consistent with the @xmath104 source being a blend of emission from the bcg and material to the north .",

    "the path of the escaping galaxy is traced by its ionized tail , the velocity of the escaping galaxy is probably close to the cluster escape velocity , and the small velocity gradient along that tail is caused by gas drag from the ism of the bcg .",

    "<S> during a systematic search for supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) not in galactic nuclei , we identified the compact symmetric radio source b3  1715 + 425 with an emission - line galaxy offset @xmath0 from the nucleus of the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) in the redshift @xmath1 cluster zwcl  8193 . </S>",
    "<S> b3  1715 + 425 is too bright ( brightness temperature @xmath2 at observing frequency @xmath3 ) and too luminous ( 1.4  ghz luminosity @xmath4 ) to be powered by anything but a smbh , but its host galaxy is much smaller ( @xmath5 full width between half - maximum points ) and optically fainter ( r - band absolute magnitude @xmath6 ) than any other radio galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> its high radial velocity @xmath7 relative to the bcg , continuous ionized wake extending back to the bcg nucleus , and surrounding debris indicate that the radio galaxy was tidally shredded passing through the bcg core , leaving a nearly naked supermassive black hole fleeing from the bcg with space velocity @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the radio galaxy has mass @xmath9 and infrared luminosity @xmath10 close to its dust eddington limit , so it is vulnerable to further mass loss from radiative feedback . </S>"
