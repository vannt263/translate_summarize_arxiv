    "more generally , mesh coupling can relax strict conformity requirements during mesh generation , or combine submodels that have been created independently .",
    "our motivation comes from computational electromagnetics , where the most common coupling methods are based either on interpolation @xcite , or on projection by means of lagrange multipliers @xcite , also known as mortar element methods @xcite .",
    "mesh coupling methods should be accurate , efficient and preserve the key structures .",
    "accurate in that their convergence rate should not deteriorate the convergence of the numerical schemes in the adjacent domains , and efficient so that the additional numerical effort should be acceptable . specifically in the context of electromagnetics , the structure of the de rham complex",
    "should be preserved , for it is crucial to maxwell s equations .",
    "for example , the property of being a gradient field should be retained while passing from one mesh to another .",
    "this is comparable to geometric multigrid , where structure - preserving restriction and prolongation operators were discussed , e.g. , in @xcite .",

    "we consider the trace spaces @xmath8 of whitney @xmath9-forms ( @xmath10 ) on the interface related to domain @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the cases @xmath10 correspond to nodal , edge , and facet elements , respectively .",

    "moreover , we require @xmath17 , @xmath18 , where the exterior derivative @xmath19 represents the surface gradient ( @xmath20 ) or surface curl ( @xmath21 ) , respectively ( _ commuting property _ ) . this way , the structure of the de rham complex is preserved when projecting from one mesh to the other .",
    "in a straightforward approach the interface data is interpolated by the whitney map on one mesh and then integrated on the other mesh with the de rham map . since",
    "both whitney and de rham maps commute with the exterior derivative , this approach enjoys the commuting property .",
    "the implementation is relatively straightforward , and the numerical effort grows linearly with the number of interface degrees of freedom .",

    "the weak continuity condition characterized by @xmath24 can be directly taken into account as a constraint in the construction of the global variational space .",

    "in @xcite it is explained how the symmetric positive definite formulation can be restored on the algebraic level , by eliminating the lagrange multipliers algebraically .",
    "projection methods require the inversion of a mass matrix .",
    "this can be done efficiently by using biorthogonal bases for the lagrange multiplier space @xcite , resulting in a diagonal mass matrix .",
