    "the vision of automated infrastructure monitoring and damage detection corresponds to the motivation of a body of work conducted by our research team and aims to develop the `` aerial robotic worker '' ( arw ) as a class of systems that among others are able to autonomously conduct structural inspection operations .",
    "infrastructure is the foundation that connects our resources , energy flows , communities , and people , driving our economy and improving our quality of life . for our economies to be sustainable , a first class infrastructure system , in terms of quality , distribution , long  term operation , systematic inspection and maintenance is required . within recent years , the scientific breakthroughs and technological developments in the area of civilian mobile robotics have progressively brought robotics closer to real ",
    "life challenging applications , and pioneering use cases have already shown a very promising potential .",
    "indicative scenarios include those of monitoring of bridges , solar farms , power generation and distribution facilities , geothermal facilities , oil & gas industry infrastructure , water dams and more .",
    "as indicated in several reports such as the one provided by the american society of civil engineers ( asce )  @xcite , our infrastructure is under the urgent need for a more systematic approach for the relevant inspection operations due to its degraded condition .",
    "characteristically , the us dams are graded with @xmath0 by asce and among the @xmath1 dams , @xmath2 are characterized as high  hazard , while their average age is @xmath3 years . the @xmath4 u.s .",
    "bridges are graded with @xmath5 , have an average age of @xmath6 years and @xmath7 out of @xmath8 of them are rated as structurally deficient .        but to automate the inspection process , an aerial robot should be something much more than a position  controlled camera in the sky . to develop the aerial robotic worker for inspection operations , significant challenges in perception and path planning have to be addressed . within the framework of this work , we provide an overview of a set of algorithms that were recently proposed by our team and break new ground on how an aerial robot handles efficient exploration of unknown environments , volumetric mapping and full coverage , high fidelity structural 3d reconstruction and as a last step , possibly required contact  based inspection .",
    "the proposed algorithms specifically address the problems of a ) optimal full coverage of a structure for which a known geometric model exists , b ) fast , optimized ( but suboptimal ) full coverage inspection of structures with known geometric model , c ) uniform coverage of such structures , d ) autonomous exploration and inspection of completely unknown environments and the structures in them , and finally e ) contact  based inspection of selected points of interest on the @xmath9 structure .",
    "each algorithm has its advantages and disadvantages , while an overall architecture is proposed such that their combination can lead to the fully autonomous execution of inspection tasks in either known or unknown environments with selective levels of computational cost and inspection precision .",
    "it is noted that , all the proposed methods have been experimentally verified .",
    "figure  [ fig : intro ] presents a subset of the relevant results . within this work ,",
    "we present highlights of the previously derived results but also new studies , including multi ",
    "robot exploration studies , and derive conclusions regarding the specific role of each algorithm and the considered future research directions .",
    "the report structure is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : sec2 ] each of the exploration and inspection methods is overviewed .",
    "a discussion on the role of each method takes place in section  [ sec : sec4 ] , followed by the description of an architecture for their combination .",
    "finally conclusions and remarks on future work takes place in section  [ sec : sec5 ] .",
    "a set of algorithms addressing the problems of inspection and exploration were proposed and are summarized below .      in the literature , many contributions have been made towards addressing the challenges of coverage planning . within the most recent contributions , those that employ a two  step optimization scheme proved to be more versatile with respect to the inspection scenario . in a first step ,",
    "such algorithms compute the minimal set of viewpoints that cover the whole structure which corresponds to solving an art gallery problem ( agp ) . as a second step",
    ", the shortest connecting tour over all these viewpoints has to be computed , which is the traveling salesman problem ( tsp ) .",
    "however , the general approach of breaking the problem of finding full coverage paths into that of finding a minimal set of viewpoints and only afterwards perform tour optimization does not in general guarantee inspection path optimality . furthermore , in cases of nonholonomic vehicles and presence of obstacles , such methods can also lead to overall infreasible solutions . to overcome these limitations , a new algorithm called rapidly  exploring random tree of trees ( rrtot )",
    "was proposed and employs sampling  based methods and a meta  tree structure consisting of multiple rrt@xmath10trees to find admissible paths with decreasing cost . using this approach",
    ", rrtot does not suffer from the limitations of strategies that seperate the problem into that of finding the solution to the agp and afterwards solving the derived tsp .",
    "essentially , rrtot relies on a sampling  based algorithm that generates trees that root from previously random sampled vertices of other trees . in that sense , this tree  of  trees structure ( which is essentially a connected forest ) has the capacity to arbitrarily vary coverage path topologies and from that ensures that the optimal solution can be found . in our relevant paper",
    "@xcite , the principles of incremental solution derivation and asymptotic optimality are proven .",
    "the algorithm supports both holonomic as well as nonholonomic systems , and also further accounts for sensor model constraints .",
    "figure  [ fig : rrtot_res ] presents one of the relevant experimental results for the case of a multirotor aerial robot .",
    "the recorded flight can be found at  https://youtu.be/e7ljydm9h8o .     and it was computed after several minutes of operation of the rrtot algorithm .",
    "video : ` https://youtu.be/e7ljydm9h8o ` ]      aiming towards _ efficient _ derivation of full coverage , admissible , optimized although not necessarily true optimal inspection path planning , our team further proposed the structural inspection planner ( sip )  @xcite , an algorithm that retains a two  step optimization paradigm but contrary to trying to find a minimal set of viewpoints in the agp , it rather tries to sample them such that the connecting path is short while ensuring coverage .",
    "this is driven by the idea that with a continuously sensing sensor , the number of viewpoints ( and if this is minimal or not ) is not necessarily important but mostly their configuration in space , which has to be such that short and full coverage paths are provided . to achieve its goal , sip iterates between a step that samples a new set of viewpoint configurations and a second step within which it computes collision  free paths and performs tour optimization .",
    "one viewpoint is sampled for each subset of the structure ( e.g. for each face of a mesh representation of the structure ) and a convex optimization technique ensures the visibility of the associated subset of the overall manifold . as the algorithm iteratively executes these two steps , it manages to find improved solutions - a goal that is further assisted by a set of heuristics  @xcite .",
    "both holonomic and nonholonomic vehicles are supported , the constraints of the sensor model are respected , while implementations for mesh  based and octomap  based representations of the structure are available .",
    "the overall implementation is open ",
    "sourced  @xcite and available as a robot operating system ( ros ) package .",

    "the recorded flight video can be found at  https://youtu.be/5ki5ppgtciq .     for maximum forward velocity of @xmath11 and maximum yaw rate equal to @xmath12 .",
    "video : ` https://youtu.be/5ki5ppgtciq ` ]      in real  life inspection operations , uniform coverage with equal focus on the details is one of the often desired properties . to aproach this problem , an algorithm that exploits the uniformity properties of voronoi ",
    "based meshing techniques was proposed .",
    "the specific method of `` uniform coverage @xmath9 structural inspection path planning '' ( uc@xmath13d ) iteratively loads lower  fidelity meshes of the structure to be inspected ( by subsampling ) , computes a set of viewpoints with each one of them ensuring the inspection of one of the faces from a similar distance and perceiving angle and finds the optimal tour among them .",
    "viewpoint derivation is achieved by randomly sampling within the subset of the configuration space that allows `` uniform '' inspection , while path feasibility is supported by verifying connectivity with the neighboring viewpoints subject to any nonholonomic constraints .",
    "as long as the algorithm can not find an overall feasible solution at one of its iteration , the process is repeated until randomization leads to solution feasibility .",

    "video : ` https://youtu.be/gg9qsf3y8iu ` ]      autonomous exploration planning refers to the capacity of a robot to map a previously unknown environment .",
    "early work includes @xcite , where good `` next  best  views '' are determined in order to cover a given structure .",
    "advanced versions were recently presented  @xcite , while the method of frontiers  based planning corresponds to one of the most widely used exploration strategies . within our work in  @xcite , a receding horizon approach to the problem of next  best  ciew planning ( nbvp ) is proposed and experimentally verified .",
    "the views are sampled as nodes in a random tree , the edges of which directly give a path to follow such that the viewpoints are sequentially reached . at every step ,",
    "a finite  depth tree of views is sampled but only the first step is executed by the robot , while the whole process is repeated at the next iteration . this receding horizon strategy improves and robustifies the exploratory behavior of the robot . figure  [ fig : nbvp_res ] presents an indicative experimental result .",
    "it is noted that this planner is also open ",
    "sourced  @xcite and accompanied by an open dataset  @xcite .",
    "a relevant experiment is recorded and is available at  https://youtu.be/d6uvejymea4 .",
    "furthermore , in our work in  @xcite , the problems of autonomous exploration and robot localizability are addressed together . in particular , a localization uncertainty  aware receding horizon exploration and mapping ( rhem ) planner is proposed .",
    "the rhem planner relies on a two  step , receding horizon , belief space  based approach . at first , in an online computed random tree , the algorithm identifies the branch that optimizes the amount of new space expected to be explored .",
    "the first viewpoint configuration of this branch is selected , but the path towards it is decided through a second planning step . within that ,",
    "a new tree is sampled , admissible branches arriving at the reference viewpoint are found and the robot belief about its state and the tracked landmarks is propagated . as system state the concatenation of the robot states and tracked landmarks ( visual features ) is considered . then , the branch that minimizes the localization uncertainty , as factorized using the d  optimality ( d  opt ) of the pose and landmarks covariance is selected .",
    "the corresponding path is conducted by the robot and the process is iteratively repeated .",
    "figure  [ fig : rhem_steps ] illustrates the basic steps of this planner .",
    "figure  [ fig : arena_experiment ] presents indicative experimental results and the video in https://youtu.be/iventqyuut4 demonstrates the overall experiment .        , while during belief propagation , visibility check for the tracked landmarks takes place .",
    "the result is a consistent @xmath9 map despite the size and the challenges of the environment . ]      given that a structure is inspected and its @xmath9 reconstruction has been succesfully derived , a next possible step within an infrastructure monitoring application may require contact  based inspection to conduct non  destructive testing for structural integrity aspects such as gas pipe wall thickness or measurements .",
    "these processes are conducted using sensors such as ultrasound probes which require physical contact with the structure .",
    "this fact , motivated the research efforts of our team and of the commmunity to address the problem of flight control during physical interaction . in response to this need , we developed a hybrid model predictive control ( hmpc ) approach that relies on a hybrid model of the aerial robot dynamics using essentially different dynamic modes during the free  flight and physical interaction phases of the operation  @xcite .",
    "the hmpc approach ensures stability during the mode switching , robust execution of physical interaction tasks and high  performance free  flight .",
    "building on top of this capacity , a framework that allows the user to select a set of points to be inspected on the physical surface and then finding the optimal route among them was proposed  @xcite and the overall method is called contact  based inspection planning and control ( cipc ) .",
    "this framework also allows to overcome an obstacle on the physical surface also by undocking from it and re  docking at the next point of interest .",
    "figure  [ fig : cip_res ] presents an indicative result using a multicopter aerial robot , while the recorded flight video is available at https://youtu.be/ldphneb66we .",
    "a planning ensemble for inspection and exploration has been proposed and experimentally verified towards realizing the aerial robotic worker for inspection operations . among the three algorithms for inspection ,",
    "rrtot is characterized by optimality but very expensive computations , uc@xmath13d focuses primarily on uniform coverage , while sip provides a rather balanced solution characterized by optimized cost and limited computational cost and needs .",
    "all these three algorithms require that a geometrical model of the structure to be inspected is known a priori . on the contrary ,",
    "nbvp and rhem assume no prior knowledge of the environment and enable its autonomous exploration . while rrtot , sip and uc@xmath13d are global planners , nbvp and rhem are local planning solutions that reactively compute the next  best  viewpoint of the robot given its online computed @xmath9 reconstruction of the previously unknown environment .",
    "the rhem planner goes further to identify the trajectory that visits the best exploration viewpoint while maintaining low localization uncertainty .",
    "given the different role and features of these algorithms , they can correspond to a relatively complete , real  life , structural inspection solution through their combination .",
