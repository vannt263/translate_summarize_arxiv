    "countable markov maps , that is , interval maps with countably many expanding branches , have received much attention over the past several years .",
    "they appear in particular in diophantine approximation in the study of approximation rates of irrationals by rational numbers .",
    "the key examples here are the _ gauss map _",
    "@xmath11 , which generates the continued fraction expansion @xcite , and the various _ lroth maps _ , which generate lroth expansions @xcite . moreover , countable markov maps appear naturally in the study of non - uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems such as the intermittent _ manneville - pomeau maps _",
    "@xcite , where often one considers induced countable markov maps of such systems .",
    "various examples are pictured in figure [ fig : countablemarkovmaps ] below .    , the lroth map @xmath12 and the alternating lroth map @xmath13 , see @xcite for definitions . ]    in this paper , we are interested in the changes to the dynamics of countable markov maps when small pointwise perturbations are applied . a possible way to evaluate the effect of such perturbations on the dynamics of these maps is to investigate the topological conjugacies between the original map and the perturbed map , where we recall that a homeomorphism @xmath14 between two topological dynamical systems is said to be a _ topological conjugacy _ if @xmath15 . in other words ,",
    "every orbit under @xmath1 corresponds to an orbit under @xmath16 and vice versa . in the case of countable markov maps @xmath1 and @xmath16",
    "the conjugacies will usually be strictly increasing , singular maps , otherwise known as slippery devil s staircases ( a term coined by mandelbrot @xcite ) .",
    "singular here means that the derivative is lebesgue - almost everywhere equal to zero : @xmath17 now the _ degree _ of the singularity of the conjugacy @xmath18 gives us a certain sense of how `` close '' the maps @xmath1 and @xmath16 are .",
    "natural ways to measure the degree of singularity are for example the hausdorff dimension @xmath19 or the hlder exponent of the conjugacy @xmath18 .",
    "perhaps the first well - studied example of a singular function is minkowski s question - mark function @xmath20\\to [ 0,1]$ ] , which was constructed by h. minkowski in 1908 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is illustrated in figure [ fig : minkowskiluroth ] .",
    "this function was originally designed precisely to map all rational numbers in @xmath21 $ ] onto the dyadic rationals , and all algebraic numbers of degree two onto the non - dyadic rationals , in an order preserving way .",
    "the main idea was to illustrate the lagrange property of the algebraic numbers of degree two ( see theorem 28 in @xcite ) .",
    "the function @xmath22 was proved to be singular by denjoy @xcite , and was also studied by salem @xcite .",
    "more recently , kessebhmer and stratmann @xcite showed that the minkowski question - mark function can be thought of as the topological conjugacy between the gauss map and the alternating lroth map ( or , equivalently , between the classical farey map from elementary number theory and the tent map ) .",
    "moreover , they showed that the derivative can either take the value zero , be infinite , or else it does nt exist .",
    "they then applied previous thermodynamical results to compute the hausdorff dimension of the sets where the derivative is infinite and where it does nt exist , and these dimensions turn out to be equal @xcite .     and the @xmath23-farey - minkowski function @xmath24 for the classical alternating lroth map @xmath12 , as shown above . ]",
    "the hausdorff dimension of the set of non - zero derivative for a variant of the minkowski question - mark function has been studied by li , xiao and dekking in @xcite , and for the case of expanding maps of the interval with finitely many increasing branches by kessebhmer _",
    "_ in @xcite .",
    "a similar problem has also been studied in the case of singular functions which are increasing but not strictly increasing , such as for several variants of the cantor ternary function , see @xcite for example . moreover ,",
    "similar results have been considered for topological conjugacies ( called @xmath9-_farey - minkowski functions _ ) between @xmath9-lroth maps by munday @xcite ( an example is shown in figure [ fig : minkowskiluroth ] ) and later by arroyo @xcite , where he considers the conjugacy maps between the gauss map and any @xmath9-lroth map .",
    "there is extensive literature on the perturbations of dynamical systems and their effect on entropy , dimension , and other statistical quantities under both random and deterministic perturbations . in our case we will study the following problem : how do the notions of singularity of the topological conjugacy @xmath18 between countable markov maps @xmath1 and @xmath16 behave when @xmath1 and @xmath16 are sufficiently close ? here by `` closeness '' we mean the relatively weak notion that the inverse branches of @xmath1 and @xmath16 are pointwise close .",
    "heuristically here one would expect that the conjugacies @xmath18 would share the properties of the identity mapping as @xmath18 is pointwise close to the identity",
    ". we will find out that for the hausdorff dimension of the set of @xmath25 with @xmath26 , we do have some continuity under pointwise perturbations ( see theorem [ mainthm ] below ) , but under other notions of singularity of @xmath18 , such as hlder exponents or hausdorff dimension of the @xmath18 image of the absolutely continuous invariant measure , the continuity fails to occur ( see propositions [ prop : holder ] , [ prop : hausdorff ] , [ prop : lyapunov ] below ) due to the non - compact nature of countable markov maps .",
    "to state our main result , let us first fix a little notation ( we refer to section [ sec : prelim ] for a more thorough exposition ) .",
    "let @xmath27 \\to [ 0,1]$ ] be @xmath28 contractions for each @xmath29 and where either @xmath30 , @xmath31 for all @xmath29 and @xmath32 is a decreasing sequence with @xmath33 or we have that @xmath34 , @xmath35 for all @xmath29 and @xmath36 is a decreasing sequence .",
    "these maps are the inverse branches of a piecewise differentiable countable markov map @xmath1 .",
    "we assume some regularity on @xmath1 and a standard assumption in this setting is that the geometric potential @xmath37 has _ summable variations _",
    "( see section [ sec : thermo ] for a definition ) , that is , @xmath38 which is satisfied , for example , for the gauss map , jump transformations of the manneville - pomeau map , and for all @xmath9-lroth maps .",
    "we will fix such a system \\{@xmath1 , @xmath39 } and consider perturbations of the system , in the following sense .    for each @xmath40",
    "we will consider a system with maps @xmath41 and @xmath42 satisfying the variation assumption above and where for each @xmath43 $ ] we have @xmath44 we need that @xmath41 have the same orientation as the maps @xmath45 .",
    "this means the dynamical systems @xmath42 and @xmath1 are topologically conjugate and we will denote the conjugacy by @xmath46 , that is the homeomorphism @xmath47\\to [ 0,1]$ ] satisfies that @xmath48 .",
    "now the pointwise convergence of the inverse branches guarantee that when @xmath2 , we have that the conjugacy @xmath4 will flatten and converge pointwise to the identity mapping , see figure [ fig : limitperturbation ] for example .     between two countable markov maps @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the map @xmath1 is the @xmath49-lroth map for the dyadic partition @xmath49 and @xmath0 is the @xmath9-lroth map for a @xmath50-adic partition for @xmath50 attaining the values @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the maps @xmath4 approach the identity pointwise when @xmath55 pointwise . ]",
    "thus one would expect that @xmath4 should share the properties of the identity in the limit .",
    "our main result shows that this happens for the hausdorff dimension of the set @xmath56 under suitable assumptions on the converging family of countable markov maps .",
    "[ mainthm ] suppose @xmath1 is a countable markov map with inverse branches @xmath45 such that the potential @xmath57 has summable variations .",
    "let @xmath58 be a sequence of countable markov maps with inverse branches @xmath41 .",
    "assume the following two assumptions on the tail and variations :    * there exists @xmath59 with @xmath60|^t<\\infty.\\ ] ] * the potentials @xmath61 have summable variations with a uniform bound over @xmath62 : @xmath63    under these assumptions , if for any @xmath64 the inverse branches @xmath55 pointwise as @xmath2 , we have @xmath65    let us make a few remarks on the conditions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) required in theorem [ mainthm ] .",
    "the condition ( 1 ) holds if the countable markov map @xmath1 has at most a polynomially fat tail , in the sense that the lengths @xmath66| = o(i^{-p})$ ] as @xmath67 for some @xmath68 .",
    "thus ( 1 ) yields in particular that the absolutely continuous invariant measure for @xmath1 has finite entropy , but it is not an equivalent condition .",
    "the condition ( 2 ) on variation in theorem [ mainthm ] is satisfied if the inverse branches of @xmath0 are linear , i.e. , when the maps @xmath0 are @xmath9-lroth maps for certain partitions @xmath9 in the notation of @xcite .",
    "thus our result gives rather general conditions to have such a perturbation theorem for @xmath9-lroth maps , provided that the map being perturbed has a thin enough tail .    in the non - linear case",
    ", the gauss map will satisfy the tail assumption ( 1 ) we impose , so the perturbation theorem is valid provided we have a uniform bound ( 2 ) over the sums of variations on the family of maps converging to the gauss map .",
    "furthermore , the conditions in theorem [ mainthm ] are weak enough for us to apply theorem [ mainthm ] to the study of a certain family of intermittent maps in non - uniformly hyperbolic dynamics known as the _ manneville - pomeau maps _ @xmath69 \\to [ 0,1]$ ] , @xmath70,\\ ] ] for a parameter @xmath71 .",
    "the jump transformations ( in other words , `` accelerated dynamics '' or induced maps ) for @xmath72 give us countable markov maps that have polynomial tail and satisfy the assumptions of theorem [ mainthm ] when varying the parameter @xmath9 for the maps @xmath72 , since this means pointwise convergence of the inverse branches .",
    "thus we obtain the following corollary to theorem [ mainthm ] :    [ cor : mp ] let @xmath73 .",
    "then as @xmath74 we have @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the topological conjugacy between the manneville - pomeau maps @xmath77 and @xmath72 .",
    "corollary [ cor : mp ] concerns the topological stability for @xmath72 when varying @xmath9 .",
    "a related area of study for manneville - pomeau maps is the measure theoretical _ statistical stability _",
    ", where the behaviour of the absolutely continuous invariant measure for @xmath72 is studied when varying @xmath9 , see for example the recent works by freitas and todd @xcite and baladi and todd @xcite .",
    "there are also other natural ways to measure the singularity of the conjugacies @xmath4 and the effect of perturbations to them .",
    "however , we will see that the continuity as presented in theorem [ mainthm ] fails for these quantities .",
    "we will consider three possible examples below .",
    "firstly , observe that the topological conjugacies @xmath4 are all hlder continuous .",
    "thus one might expect that the hlder exponent @xmath78 of @xmath4 ( see section [ sec : prelim ] for definitions ) would converge to @xmath79 , which is the hlder exponent of the identity .",
    "however , this can be made to fail :    [ prop : holder ] there exist examples of @xmath0 and @xmath1 satisfying the assumptions of theorem [ mainthm ] such that the hlder exponents @xmath78 of @xmath4 satisfy @xmath80    a similar behaviour can be observed also in the following setting .",
    "if @xmath7 is the absolutely continuous @xmath1-invariant measure , then one might also expect that the hausdorff dimensions @xmath6 of the @xmath4-preimages of the measure @xmath7 would converge to @xmath79 .",
    "on the other hand , the maps @xmath0 can be chosen such that the the dimensions do not converge to the expected value :    [ prop : hausdorff ] there exist examples of @xmath0 and @xmath1 satisfying the assumptions of theorem [ mainthm ] such that the hausdorff dimensions of @xmath81 satisfy @xmath82    moreover , denoting by @xmath83 the absolutely continuous @xmath0-invariant measure , we also consider the entropy ( that is , the lyapunov exponent ) of the absolutely continuous invariant measures for the maps @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "if we would have that @xmath84 , instead of pointwise convergence of the inverse branches of @xmath0 , it would be considerably easier to prove the statement of the main result theorem [ mainthm ] . however , @xmath84 is too strong a property to be deduced from pointwise convergence , as the following result shows .",
    "[ prop : lyapunov ] there exist examples of @xmath0 and @xmath1 satisfying the assumptions of theorem [ mainthm ] such that the entropy @xmath85 but the limit @xmath86    we remark that in the uniformly hyperbolic compact case , i.e. , in the situation of finitely many branches with uniform expansion rate , all these notions can be shown to be continuous under pointwise perturbations .",
    "the heuristic reason for propositions [ prop : holder ] , [ prop : hausdorff ] and [ prop : lyapunov ] is that they represent notions that are very sensitive to the tail behaviour of the countable markov maps @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the idea of the proof of theorem [ mainthm ] is that we approximate the infinite systems considered by a finite branch system and in this approximation the precise nature of the tails is not so important , except in terms of the tail of the limiting map @xmath1 ( the tail condition ( 1 ) of theorem [ mainthm ] ) .",
    "thus the hausdorff dimension of non - differentiability points will not be as sensitive to the tails as the hlder exponent @xmath78 , hausdorff dimension of @xmath81 or the entropy @xmath87 .",
    "the limit obtained in theorem [ mainthm ] does not tell us about the possible rate of the numbers @xmath88 converging to @xmath79 as @xmath89 approaches infinity .",
    "if we restrict the class of countable markov maps we consider , then this can be addressed and the hausdorff dimension can be explicitly computed . for this , we will consider a class of countable markov maps similar to those arising from the _",
    "salem family _ considered in @xcite .",

    "we obtain the following theorem .",
    "[ mainthm2 ] fix @xmath94 and let @xmath95 be the topological conjugacy between @xmath91 and @xmath96 . then @xmath97 where @xmath98    due to the choice of the specific countable markov maps @xmath91 , the proof of theorem [ mainthm2 ] is reduced to the study of conjugacies between tent - like expanding maps with two full branches , one increasing and one decreasing .",
    "a similar result was obtained in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.1 ) , where the authors consider a family of expanding maps with finitely many increasing full branches .",
    "however , as we have one increasing and one decreasing branch , the proof in our situation is rather simpler than in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sections",
    "[ sec : prelim ] and [ sec : thermo ] we will give all the necessary background results from dimension theory and thermodynamic formalism . in section [ sec : mainthm ] we will give the proof of theorem [ mainthm ] .",

    "so for all @xmath229 the union for @xmath665 of @xmath374th level cylinders @xmath662 $ ] where @xmath666 forms a cover of the set @xmath667 .",
    "we will denote this cover by @xmath668 .",
    "to finish the proof of ( [ starp8 ] ) in light of remark [ remp10 ] it suffices to show that @xmath677 however , this again can be done precisely as in @xcite , so we omit the details .",
    "thus the proof of proposition [ prop : salemthermo ] is complete .",
    "let us now show how to prove theorem [ mainthm2 ] using proposition [ prop : salemthermo ] .",
    "first , fix @xmath678 and denote by @xmath679 the conjugacy map between @xmath91 and @xmath96 . in order to apply proposition [ prop : salemthermo",

    "we apply proposition [ prop : salemthermo ] with @xmath684 and @xmath685 the tent map . in this case",
    "the potentials @xmath686 and @xmath687 are given by @xmath688 and similarly for @xmath689 . also , since these maps are linear , we have that the measure @xmath690 is given by the @xmath691-bernoulli measure @xmath692 such that @xmath693 let us find the precise value for this @xmath694 as follows .",
    "the fraction is @xmath695 and so @xmath696 furthermore , as @xmath697 is an equilibrium measure , we have that @xmath698 as claimed .",
    "the proof of proposition [ prop : salemthermo ] is similar to how in @xcite the _",
    "salem family _",
    "@xmath699 is analysed , where the salem maps are interval maps with two increasing branches with slopes @xmath700 and @xmath701 .",
