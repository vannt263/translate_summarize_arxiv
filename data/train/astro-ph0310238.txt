    "for many years , both observations and theory have provided extensive support for the existence of structure in the interstellar medium ( ism ) on scales from @xmath0 1 kpc down to @xmath0 1 pc ( cf .",
    "however , it has long been expected that structure on smaller scales ( @xmath1 pc ) would _ not _ be prominent in the ism @xcite . indeed , using median values for thermal pressure and temperature of the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) of @xmath2 @xmath3 k @xcite and t @xmath070 k @xcite ,",
    "the expected volume density for the cnm clouds is about 30 @xmath3 . the median measured column density of 5@xmath4 @xmath5 @xcite ,",
    "would then indicate that the _ typical _ expected scale length for the cnm features is @xmath6 pc , in conformance with the standard theory and observations .",
    "consequently , it was quite surprising when observers began to find structure on @xmath7 au scales in many different directions in the ism .",
    "the apparent detections of the au - sized structure in the cold neutral atomic hydrogen ( hi ) medium , called tiny ",
    "scale atomic structure [ `` tsas '' , @xcite ] , were obtained with the following techniques : ( 1 ) spatial mapping of hi absorption line profiles across extended background sources @xcite ; ( 2 ) temporal and spatial variations of optical interstellar absorption lines against binary stars and globular clusters @xcite ; and ( 3 ) time variability of hi absorption profiles against pulsars @xcite .",
    "since the au - sized structure was detected very frequently , it was thought that it is likely to be a general property of the ism .",
    "tsas observations yield measurements of optical depth variation ( @xmath8 ) and the particular temporal baseline over which the variation is measured .",
    "the baseline can also be converted into a transverse angular size ( @xmath9 ) if the background source speed or distance is known , respectively .",
    "a straightforward interpretation is that the optical depth variations are due to a blob , whose transverse dimension is equal to @xmath9 , moving into and out of the line - of - sight . assuming a simple spherical geometry , the hi volume density of these blobs can be estimated and is typically of order of @xmath10 @xmath3 , far above the canonically expected value .",
    "the inferred thermal pressure is then of the order of @xmath11 @xmath3 k ( assuming t @xmath04070 k ) , which is also much higher than the hydrostatic equilibrium pressure of the ism or the standard thermal pressure of the cnm .",
    "these problems have been known for a long time and have caused much controversy .",
    "it is expected that such over - dense and over - pressured features should dissipate on a time scale of about 100 yrs and should therefore not be common in the ism , yet the tsas observations have indicated that they are apparently ubiquitous .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found evidence for the existence of over - pressured gas ( @xmath12 @xmath3 k ) using ci fine - structure excitation , indicating that pressure enhancements could be widespread in the ism and may even be related to the tsas .",
    "several explanations were proposed to reconcile the observations of extensive tsas with theory .",
    "@xcite proposed that tsas features are curved filaments and/or sheets that happen to be aligned along our line - of - sight .",
    "@xcite suggested that tsas blobs correspond to the tail of a hierarchical structure organization that exists on larger scales , rather than discrete structures with longitudinal dimension @xmath9 and extraordinarily high volume densities .",
    "@xcite proposed that optical depth fluctuations seen in multi - epoch pulsar observations are a scintillation phenomenon combined with the velocity gradient across the absorbing hi .",
    "different explanations predict a different level of optical depth variations at a particular scale size .",
    "for example , @xcite expects that optical depth variations would increase with the size of structure , while @xcite predicts maximum variations on the very small spatial scales probed by interstellar scintillation . all suggested explanations , however , call for more observational data .",
    "motivated by the recent theoretical efforts in understanding the nature and origin of the tsas we have undertaken new multi - epoch observations of hi absorption against a set of bright pulsars .",
    "we chose to observe the same sources as frail et al .",
    "( 1994 ) in order to enhance the number of available time baselines for comparison .",
    "this paper summarizes our first results from this project for three pulsars , b0823 + 26 , b1133 + 16 and b2016 + 28 . in section  [ s : obs ]",
    "we summarize our observing and data processing strategies .",
    "results on individual objects are presented in section  [ s : results ] and discussed in section  [ s : discussion ] .",
    "we have used the arecibo telescope to obtain new multi - epoch hi absorption measurements against six pulsars previously studied by frail et .",
    "al . ( 1994 ) .",
    "the observing and data processing procedures were very similar to @xcite , who measured pulsar oh absorption profiles at arecibo with the same backend , the caltech baseband recorder .",
    "we had four observing sessions : august 2000 , december 2000 , september 2001 and november 2001 , searching for hi absorption profile variations over time intervals from less than a day to 1.25 years .",

    "our basic data product was a cube of pulsar intensity as a function of pulsar rotational phase and radio frequency .",
    "` pulsar - on ' and ` pulsar - off ' spectra were then accumulated by finding the pulsar pulse in software , and extracting spectra during the pulse and between pulses , respectively .",
    "the pulsar absorption spectrum is created by generating the ` pulsar - on '  ` pulsar - off ' spectrum for each scan , doing frequency switching to flatten the baseline , and accumulating all such spectra with a weight proportional to @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the antenna temperature of the pulsar .",
    "final absorption and emission spectra have velocity resolution of 0.5 .",
    "for each pulsar , we display a single absorption spectrum on top , and then one or more absorption spectrum differences between two epochs .",
    "overlaid atop each difference spectrum is a @xmath152-@xmath16 significance envelope . to calculate this expected noise level ,",
    "we have taken into account the following contributions .",
    "( 1 ) the sky background contribution was estimated from the all sky survey at 408 mhz by @xcite and scaled to 1.4 ghz using a spectral index of @xmath17 .",
    "( 2 ) the contribution from hi _ emission _ was estimated from the ` pulsar - off ' spectra and scaled appropriately to match previously published observations .",
    "the effect of this contribution can be very significant .",
    "for example the rms noise on  line is three times higher than the rms noise off - line for the case of b2016 + 28 .",
    "( 3 ) the pulsar continuum emission itself is also sufficiently strong to contribute an additional @xmath18 to the noise temperature .",
    "information on individual objects and an upper limit on @xmath19 are given in table 1 ( note that these are 2-@xmath16 limits at the hi line ) .",

    "[ f:0823_1133 ] ( left ) compares hi absorption profiles obtained toward b0823 + 26 in 2000.6 and 2000.9 .",
    "we find _ no _ significant change in absorption over this time span down to a @xmath19 level of about 0.04 .",
    "the time interval of 0.3 yr translates to a transverse distance of about 10 au .",
    "frail et al .",
    "( 1994 ) also found almost no variations over a period of 0.6 yr , but _ did _ report variations of about 0.07 over a period of 1.1 yr . see the discussion section below for an examination of the discrepancies between the two groups results .",

    "( 1994 ) 1991.9 data .",
    "the 0.3 yr baseline , corresponding to a @xmath25 au scale , shows only a marginal 2.6-@xmath16 change in absorption , while the 8.7 yr , @xmath26 au baseline , does not exhibit any significant variations at all .",
    "this result is very different from frail et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , who found very large optical depth variations of @xmath27 over periods of 0.6 and 1.7 yr .    the frail et al . ( 1994 ) epoch 1991.9 absorption spectrum that we use for the above comparison is particularly different from the previous three frail et al .",

    "frail et al .",
    "( 1994 ) remarked that the apparent change could be caused by an incorrect normalization but were confident that was not the case .",
    "we further investigate the apparent frail et al .",
    "variations by comparing our 2000.6 spectrum with the pre-1991.9 frail et al . profiles .",
    "as expected , there is a large difference in the depth of all four absorption features , as shown in the top plot on the right side of fig .",
    "[ f:2016 ] where the 1990.9 frail et al .",
    "spectrum is plotted with a dot - dashed line and our 2000.6 result is plotted as a thin solid line . since all four lines exhibit the same trend , it seems reasonable that the differences may result from a slight calibration problem in the frail et al .",
    "data . to test this hypothesis",
    ", we performed a least ",
    "squares fit for a single scale factor ( plus an offset ) that would minimize the difference between these two spectra .    after applying this fitted scale factor ( @xmath29 ) and a constant ( @xmath30 ) to the 1990.9 spectrum",
    ", we arrive at the `` scaled '' 1990.9 spectrum , shown as a thick solid line in the top right plot of fig .",
    "[ f:2016 ] .",
    "note that this process brings the previously discrepant 1990.9 profile into excellent agreement with the 2000.6 result . the bottom right plot of fig .",
    "[ f:2016 ] emphasizes this result by exhibiting the difference between the 2000.6 and scaled 1990.9 spectra .",
    "a single 3-@xmath16 deviation is all that remains .",
    "note that without scaling , this change would be much larger .",
    "we conclude that most of the apparent variations among the frail et al .",
    "b2016 + 28 spectra , and hence between our epoch 2000.6 data and the early frail et al .",
    "epochs , could result from a systematic calibration issue in the frail et al .",
    "the measurement of pulsar absorption spectra is a very delicate process fraught with subtle issues related to the strongly varying pulsar signal .",
    "we speculate that the three - level correlation spectrometer used by frail et al .",
    "was more prone to calibration problems than our current four - level spectrometer .",
    "our observations probe the existence of temporal variations in hi absorption profiles which would be indicative of the existence of the tsas on spatial scales of several tens of au in several different directions .",
    "the canonical tsas has @xmath31 au , extracted by heiles ( 1997 ) from previous observations , meaning that tsas should be common at the scales that we have studied . yet in all of the short and long baselines we have investigated , we find only two _ marginal _ detections of changing absorption .",
    "our sensitivity is better than any level of variations reported previously @xcite , at velocity resolution of 0.5 , meaning that our non - detections are a significant result .",
    "in addition , the upper limits on optical depth fluctuations , set by b0823 + 26 and b1133 + 16 at scales of 1020 au , @xmath32 , are strikingly low .",
    "a @xmath19 of 0.03 corresponds to @xmath33 @xmath5 for the column density fluctuations of the cnm , for assumed spin temperature of 50 k and the full - width half - maxima of absorption features of 2 . on slightly larger scales of 7080 aus probed by b2016 + 28 over periods of almost a decade",
    "we find a single 3-@xmath16 spike of @xmath34 , a @xmath35-@xmath16 feature of @xmath36 , and non - detections in all other cases .",
    "deshpande ( 2000 ) predicts opacity variations as an extension of hi opacity irregularities observed on larger scales using a single power law spectrum . using the power spectrum of opacity distribution in the direction of cas a with the power - law index of 2.75 and extrapolating down to au scales , they predict @xmath37 at scales @xmath38 au ( from their fig .",
    "2 ) , while at 50100 au @xmath390.20.4 is expected .",
    "this model generally expects that @xmath19 increases with spatial scales .",
    "our results for all three pulsars seem consistent with this picture so far .    why are the ( primarily ) non  detections presented here and by johnston et al .",
    "( 2003 ) so different from the results of frail et al .",
    "we showed above that in the case of b2016 + 28 where multiple absorption features are visible it is possible to simply scale absorption spectra from different epochs and get rid of most of the variations , indicating that slight calibration problems may be responsible .",
    "a similar scaling technique could significantly reduce variations seen in some of the other frail et al.s pulsars ( e.g. b0823 + 16 , b1133 + 6 , b1737 + 13 ) .",
    "however , it is not obvious that this scaling could be justified since only single principal absorption features are visible in the spectra .",
    "in addition , johnston et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have already noted that many of the differences noted by frail et al . may not be as significant as they stated .",
    "this large number of tsas non detections , together with recent results by johnston et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , is disturbing and unexpected ! while previous observations were frequently detecting tsas , in six comparisons presented here , and in many comparisons in johnston et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , there are only two _ marginal _ detections for the case of b2016 + 28 and one detection for b1641 - 45 ( johnston et al .",
    "2003 ) over a period of almost twenty years .",
    "this raises the question of the existence of tsas as traced at least by multi - epoch pulsars observations .",
    "contrary to the previous belief that the tsas is ubiquitous in the ism , our results indicate that tsas is rather rare and could be related to some kind of isolated , sporadic events such as superbubble or supernova expansion , stellar mass ejecta , or a bow - shock propagation .",
    "we have compared multi - epoch hi absorption observations toward b0823 + 26 , b1133 + 16 and b2016 + 28 over short and long periods . except for two marginal changes in the case of b2016 + 28 , we _ do not _ find significant changes in absorption spectra .",
