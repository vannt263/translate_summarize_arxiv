    "in introductory physics , students are universally taught to analyze circuits using kirchhoff s laws .",
    "the standard approach employs the loop and current laws in order to derive a set of equations that can be solved for the branch currents .",
    "this technique is , of course , very powerful in that it provides a systematic procedure for studying a variety of circuits .",
    "unfortunately , it becomes unfeasible for any circuit of modest complexity .",
    "we are forced to search for an alternative method and/or engage a computer .",
    "there have been several interesting and clever alternatives presented in the literature that aim to teach or supplement the standard methodology presented in textbooks.@xcite here , we take a more bottom - line approach and present , not an analytical method , but an experimental one to obtain the equations that govern circuit behavior .",
    "these are the same equations found through an implementation of kirchhoff s laws .",
    "the experimental method is based on a modeling approach developed to aid in controlling large , complex networks.@xcite thus , it is well suited for quite complicated circuits .",
    "it , however , is not intended to replace the learning and use of standard techniques ; it simply provides an efficient means of determining the equations when other methods of analysis are not practical or even feasible .",
    "this practicality is also accompanied by several didactic aspects , allowing students to gain insight into the nature of circuits and the method .",
    "the network modeling methodology is presented in section [ networksection ] .",
    "section [ circuitsection ] reviews the node method , a more traditional approach to circuit analysis .",
    "the results of both the circuit and network methods are compared in section [ comparesection ] .",
    "finally , section [ resultsdiscussion ] demonstrates the implementation of the network approach on a simple circuit .",
    "the network modeling approach , upon which the experimental method is based , was developed specifically for genetic networks,@xcite where accurate models are difficult or impossible to construct from experimental data.@xcite we have since shown that the approach is appropriate for a host of large , nonlinear networks.@xcite circuits can certainly fall into this category ; however , in the present work , we will restrict our attention to those appropriate for undergraduate students beyond the introductory courses ; that is , we will focus on networks of linear ( ohmic ) resistors in dc circuits .",
    "first , we will briefly outline the network modeling methodology .",
    "the details of the network modeling approach are provided elsewhere.@xcite here , we present only that which is relevant to our purpose .",
    "consider the three node network in fig .",
    "[ examplenet : net ] .",
    "a parameter @xmath0 is associated with each node .",
    "later , when discussing circuits specifically , @xmath0 will represent the potential at the node , and each arrow will symbolize an electrical component connecting two nodes .",
    "the vector @xmath1 $ ] defines the state of the system .",
    "each arrow represents the interaction between two nodes , corresponding to a possibly unknown nonlinear mathematical function .",
    "changing @xmath2 , for example , will induce a change in the values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , as determined by these functions . while the set of interactions and the associated mathematical functions are commonly unknown to us , we can often perform a set of experiments on the system in which some of the node parameters @xmath0",
    "are perturbed , and the corresponding effect on the remaining parameters is measured .",
    "an example of this would be fixing the potential at one point in a circuit and measuring the potential at the others in response to this change .",
    "when choosing nodes to perturb , we often select highly connected hub - like nodes which are able to influence many others .",
    "imagine such an experiment on the three node network .",
    "hub nodes can not exist in such a small system ; however , we choose to perturb nodes one and two ( the circles ) and observe the effect on node three ( the square ) . upon sweeping the values @xmath2 and @xmath3 ,",
    "a two dimensional surface can be formed ( fig .",
    "[ examplenet : plot ] ) . when presented in this way , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the independent variables , and @xmath4 is the dependent variable . in other words , the value @xmath4 is determined by @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the independent nodes are referred to as the master nodes ( circles ) , which determine the behavior of the remaining slave nodes ( square ) . in our network model",
    ", we make the approximation that the values of the slave nodes are exclusively determined by those of the master nodes .",
    "this approximation corresponds to ignoring the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ examplenet : net ] , which run from the slave nodes to the masters . in keeping with the approximation , any slave",
    "/ slave interactions will be ignored as well .",
    "the categorization of nodes into masters and slaves is not limited to small networks such as the one described here .",
    "networks with an arbitrary number of master / slaves can be considered . in such cases , the surfaces corresponding to fig .",
    "[ examplenet : plot ] will be higher dimensional . by determining surfaces in this way",
    ", one can construct a model of the ( directed ) interactions between the highly coupled master nodes and the sparsely coupled slaves .    unfortunately , it is often not feasible to perform the experiment imagined above for large systems .",
    "such experiments on gene networks , for example , would be prohibitively expensive.@xcite however , these surfaces exist in principle , and one can generally find an approximation to the surface by conducting only a few experiments .",
    "consider again the network of fig .",
    "[ examplenet : net ] .",
    "let the state of the system be @xmath5 $ ] when the unperturbed network is measured .",
    "this state corresponds to one point ( @xmath6 ) on the surface in fig .",
    "[ examplenet : plot ] ; the point at which the values of nodes one and two equal their unperturbed values .",
    "it is often relatively easy to perturb a system by fixing the parameter of one node to zero , _",
    "e.g. ,  _ grounding a node in a circuit . by forcing @xmath7 , the remaining parameters will be modified from their natural values , and the state of the network will be @xmath8 $ ] , where the superscript indicates the modification of node 1 .",
    "this corresponds to point @xmath9 on the surface .",
    "similarly , node two can be fixed to zero to obtain the state @xmath10 and point @xmath11 .",
    "these three points , lying in a three dimensional space , uniquely define a plane .",
    "furthermore , the points lie on both the plane and the surface , indicating close proximity between the two in the regions surrounding the points .",
    "the plane represents a good approximation to the surface if the surface is sufficiently smooth .",
    "while one may not be able to determine the surface , the plane can be found conducting relatively few experiments , in this case by measuring the state of the system three times , when it is unperturbed and upon perturbation of each master node .",
    "a series of linear equations can be written which describe the plane and relating the values of the slave node parameters to those of the master nodes . for the present case ,",
    "in which there is only one slave node , a single equation approximating the dependence of @xmath4 on @xmath2 and @xmath3 is produced , @xmath12 here , the coefficients @xmath13 describe the plane , and we have subtracted the unperturbed values @xmath14 , essentially stating that the deviation of @xmath4 from its unperturbed value is dependent on the deviations of @xmath2 and @xmath3 from theirs .",
    "( [ slaveex ] ) relates the slave parameters to those of the master nodes . for the model to be complete",
    ", one needs to account for interactions between the master nodes . in keeping with the linear approximation",
    ", we assume relationships between the master nodes take the form ,    [ masterex ] @xmath15    where the coefficients @xmath16 represent effective interactions between the master nodes .",
    "this procedure generalizes nicely to larger systems . by measuring the states of the unperturbed network and situations in which each of the @xmath17 master nodes is singly modified , we obtain @xmath18 points which lie on the surface and",
    "n_-dimensional plane or , equivalently , the elements of the @xmath16 and @xmath13 matrices .",
    "this plane is the geometric representation of the network model , which describes the response of the system to modification of the master nodes .",
    "the plane is not the surface ; however , it represents a reasonable approximation if the surface is relatively smooth",
    ". of course , this approximation can be improved , by including quadratic ( or higher ) terms at the cost of performing more experiments to determine the new parameters .",
    "0.5   of the slave node is determined by those of the master nodes . a surface , representing the values of the slave parameter , is formed upon sweeping the master node values .",
    "a plane , approximating the surface , can be determined by a few experiments .",
    "the plane is a good approximation to the surface if the surface is sufficiently smooth.,title=\"fig : \" ]     +    0.5   of the slave node is determined by those of the master nodes . a surface , representing the values of the slave parameter , is formed upon sweeping the master node values .",
    "a plane , approximating the surface , can be determined by a few experiments .",
    "the plane is a good approximation to the surface if the surface is sufficiently smooth.,title=\"fig : \" ]      the approach described above does not generally produce an exact model of the network , rather an approximation to the system is generated , the quality of which is quantified by the proximity of the plane and the surface .",
    "the methodology has been shown to accurately represent several types of networks.@xcite furthermore , the models cease to be approximate under two conditions : 1 ) the surface itself is a plane and 2 ) all nodes are considered to be master nodes .",
    "the first condition is equivalent to having all interactions between nodes be linear in nature .",
    "in such a situation , the procedure described above fits a plane on to a planar surface .",
    "the second condition removes one of the key assumptions employed when constructing the model , namely that some set of nodes , the masters , exclusively control those considered to be slaves .",
    "the removal of this approximation , combined with a linear system , results in an exact mathematical representation of the network.@xcite as there are no slave nodes , equations similar to eq .",
    "( [ slaveex ] ) are not present in the model , and the dynamics of the nodes is described by the master node equations ( eq .",

    "( [ mastereq ] ) simplify to , @xmath21 this represents an exact mathematical description of a linear system in the steady state .",
    "thus , by performing the experiments described in section [ modelsection ] , the matrix @xmath16 can be calculated ( see supplementary materials@xcite ) .",
    "the equations describing the behavior of the network will , therefore , have been determined .",
    "the equations can be put in a more convenient form by solving for the node parameters themselves .",
    "for example , in the case of a three node network ,    [ mastereqex ] @xmath22    where the values @xmath23 are constants containing the elements of @xmath16 and @xmath24 .    here , we will demonstrate that this procedure can be used to determine the equations for a circuit of resistors , even when implementation of kirchhoff s laws is not practical .",
    "for a circuit containing @xmath25 nodes , @xmath26 experiments in which the potential @xmath0 of each node is measured , need to be performed .",
    "it is not necessary to fix the node values to zero , as in the example described above .",
    "any value can be used to construct the model ; however , in the context of circuits , setting the node potential to zero ( by grounding ) is quite convenient and will be used throughout the work .",
    "the experiments described here can be performed efficiently with a computer and an analog / digital card .",
    "if such resources are unavailable , two people using a handheld multimeter , _",
    "e.g. ,  _ lab partners , can complete the experiments quickly as well . as a bonus ,",
    "we find that applying these ideas to circuits provides some physical insight into the parameters of the model ( @xmath16 ) , something which has been elusive previously .",
    "before we begin applying these ideas to circuits , it will be instructive to examine some properties of electrical networks and their equations . consider the four node network shown in fig .",

    "direct currents @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 flow into the network as shown and exit via node zero , which is held at zero potential .",
    "the potentials of the remaining nodes are @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 . for simplicity",
    ", we will utilize the node method@xcite , a technique not typically taught in undergraduate courses , to analyze this network .",

    "this observation leads one to conclude @xmath33 similar considerations lead to equations for nodes two and three ,    @xmath34    upon rearrangement , the incoming currents can be written ,    [ irv ] @xmath35    by replacing the resistances , @xmath36 with the corresponding conductances , @xmath37 , the equations can be placed in a simplified form ,    [ igv ] @xmath38    where @xmath39 and is called the coefficient of self - conductance for node one.@xcite the self - conductances of the other nodes are similar and can be obtained from the terms within the parentheses of their respective equations .",
    "it is worth noting that the coefficient of self - conductance for a node is the sum of conductances from all resistive channels connecting the node in question to the others in the network .",
    "@xcite this fact will become important when examining the physical significance of the parameters in the network equations .    the situation represented in fig .",
    "[ generalcircuit ] is not typically realized in the laboratory or classroom .",
    "more commonly , the network is connected to a single voltage source , and current enters through one or more nodes .",
    "it is then distributed throughout network and returns to the power supply .",
    "if , for example , only node one is connected to the power supply , held at potential @xmath40 , via a resistor @xmath41 , the current @xmath27 is not fixed but depends on the potential difference across @xmath41 , _",
    "i.e. ,  _ @xmath42 .",
    "the remaining currents are zero since no current is being injected into the other nodes . in this case , the updated equation for node one reads , @xmath43 , and , with the additional connection , the coefficient of self - conductance has another term , @xmath44 .",
    "the equations ( [ igv ] ) , updated to incorporate a power supply , can be solved for the node potentials to obtain ,    [ circuiteqs ] @xmath45    where the @xmath46 are constants ( possibly zero ) . in this form ,",
    "the equations relate the potential at one node to the potentials of the others and a constant .",
    "they can be used in a variety of ways .",
    "for example , they can be solved simultaneously to obtain the node potentials of the unperturbed circuit .",
    "further , if the circuit is perturbed by externally fixing the potentials of nodes two and three , eq .",
    "( [ circuiteqs : a ] ) will determine the new potential @xmath2 .",
    "if one needs to analyze a complex circuit of resistors , it might not be convenient to employ kirchhoff s laws .",
    "one can be assured , however , that equations in the form of eqs .",
    "( [ circuiteqs ] ) will describe the node potentials .",
    "alternatively , the network strategy described in sections [ modelsection ] and [ exactmodelsection ] could be implemented to obtain network equations which would also describe the circuit .",
    "specifically , for the circuit in fig .",
    "[ generalcircuit ] , one would obtain eqs .",
    "( [ mastereqex ] ) .",

    "( [ mastereqex ] ) and ( [ circuiteqs ] ) .",
    "both systems represent an exact description of the circuit and demonstrate the node potential is a linear combination of the other potentials .",
    "the coefficients preceding the node potentials as well as the constants in each system of equations must be equal , _",

    "we are assured , through eqs .",
    "( [ coefs ] ) , that these equations will be the same as those obtained through more conventional means .",
    "it is important to recognize that eqs .",
    "( [ coefs ] ) represent the most fundamental relationship between the circuit and network equations .",

    "second , a glance at their respective equations indicates that their units are different , _",

    "for every simulation described , the corresponding experiment has been performed ( by undergraduate students ) and results verified ( except for section [ burnedresistordetection ] ) .",
    "a student in an introductory course would use kirchhoff s laws to calculate the unknown branch currents and the potential differences across the resistors .",

    "such a comparison is not an efficient means of locating the burned component , especially if the circuit is large .",

    "a circuit containing 18 nodes and 30 components can not practically be analyzed by traditional methods , yet the network approach can be efficiently employed by students with common laboratory equipment . unlike the straightforward implementation of kirchhoff s laws , the network approach extracts the interactions between the nodes ( conductances ) .",
