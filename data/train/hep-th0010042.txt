    "one approach to probing m - theory at short distances is to consider the effective action beyond its lowest order approximation given by the second order ( in @xmath1 ) action @xcite @xmath2 and investigate the higher - derivative corrections generated by the microscopic theory .",
    "such corrections at order @xmath3 and @xmath0 have been extensively discussed in the literature , primarily in the context of string theory and ten - dimensional effective actions , but also in the eleven - dimensional context relevant to m - theory .",
    "the existence of these terms can be inferred by a variety of means in string theory , while in m - theory one must rely on anomaly cancellation arguments @xcite , or ( superparticle ) loop calculations @xcite together with the connection to string theory and its effective action via dimensional reduction .",
    "the methods used so far to deduce the existence of  @xmath0 terms in eleven dimensions produce only isolated terms out of a large number of terms making up the complete superinvariant that it belongs to .",
    "it is of interest to have a better understanding of these superinvariants , and there has consequently been a lot of work invested into the supersymmetrisation of the isolated terms . in particular , @xmath3 and @xmath0 terms in ten dimensions were considered already some time ago , see ref . @xcite and references therein .",
    "more recently also the @xmath0 term in eleven dimensions has been investigated @xcite including a detailed study of superinvariants .    for these purposes it would be interesting to develop methods",
    "@xcite based on superspace in eleven dimensions @xcite that would incorporate supersymmetry in a manifest way . although not yet developed into an easily applicable formalism , @xmath4=1 supergravity in ten dimensions has been constructed off - shell in terms of a linearised superspace lagrangian @xcite , including some superinvariants @xcite , and should in principle lend itself to a complete analysis of superinvariants and deduction of the corresponding higher - derivative terms in ordinary component language . the situation in eleven - dimensional",
    "m - theory is , however , completely different due to the fact that an off - shell lagrangian formulation with a finite number of auxiliary fields is not known and may not even exist . from a general counting argument by siegel and roek @xcite we know that this is true for @xmath4=4 super - yang  mills in four dimensions ( and consequently also in ten dimensions ) but that maximally supersymmetric supergravity passes the test . the analysis carried out here , when completed , will provide an answer to the question whether there exists an off - shell lagrangian formulation in eleven dimensions or not . in this respect",
    "the approach advocated here is parallel to the discussion of ten - dimensional super - yang ",
    "mills theory carried out in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , which does in fact prove that an off - shell lagrangian based on these superspace fields does not exist .    to implement the symmetries of any m - theory effective action in a manifest way",
    ", we will here follow ref .",
    "@xcite and define the theory in superspace by means of the superspace bianchi identities ( ssbis ) , which are integrability conditions when the theory is formulated in terms of superspace field strengths . from these",
    "we will derive consistency conditions on the form of the field equations .",
    "the analysis of the ssbis will depend on the structure of certain components of the supertorsion , and one particular goal is to find connections between the various possible superinvariants and consistent expressions for the components of the supertorsion .",
    "the structure of these components , as  which components can be set to zero under which conditions , will be clarified by our analysis .",
    "this is an important result since the torsion components are a vital input when proving @xmath5-invariance for m2 and m5 branes coupled to background supergravity @xcite and m - theory corrected versions of it .",
    "in fact , one should compare to the situation in iia and iib string theory and the coupling to d - branes @xcite .",
    "here it has been established that there are higher - derivative background field corrections also on the world - sheets of the branes , see  ref . @xcite and references therein .",
    "the presence of such terms complicates the issue of @xmath5-invariance and it becomes crucial to know the exact form of the supertorsion and to understand its relation to the corrections both in target space and on the brane .",
    "another aspect of the higher - derivative corrections is that it is to a large extent unclear how supersymmetry organises the infinite set of such terms into infinite subsets unrelated by supersymmetry . from previous work both in ten and eleven dimensions we know that adding one bosonic @xmath3 or @xmath0 term generates an infinite set of other terms of progressively higher order in number of derivatives",
    "this is clear in any on - shell theory , as discussed in detail in the type iib and heterotic cases in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this talk",
    "we will make use of the fact that any conceivable m - theory correction to the field equations must be compatible with supersymmetry and local lorentz invariance .",
    "this is built into the ssbis @xcite which when solved ( the meaning of which is explained below ) produce constraints on the supertorsion and other superfields that must be fulfilled by the corrections .",
    "as a first step we prove in this talk that the relaxed on - shell torsion constraints , argued for in ref .",
    "@xcite , are correct and do not lead to the field equations that follow from ( [ lagrangian ] ) .",
    "this will done without specifying the auxiliary fields in terms of physical fields , making it possible to use the weyl superspace introduced by howe @xcite to simplify the analysis of the standard on - shell theory .",
    "once the auxiliary fields are related to physical fields , the role of weyl superspace must be reconsidered , since the identification will involve a dimensionful parameter ( @xmath6 for the @xmath0 term ) .",
    "this will be done elsewhere .",
    "one of the most important results proved in ref .",
    "@xcite is that inserting the single constraint @xmath7 used in the superspace construction of eleven - dimensional supergravity @xcite , into the ssbis leads to the field equations corresponding to the lowest order lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) .",
    "this constraint must therefore be relaxed in such a way that the equations that then follow from the ssbis are able to accommodate any higher - derivative correction terms to the field equations . in order to explain how this",
    "is done we need some details of the weyl superspace formalism .",
    "this superspace is coordinatised by @xmath8 where @xmath9 enumerates the 11 bosonic and @xmath10 the 32 real fermionic coordinates respectively .",
    "the tangent superspace has as structure group the lorentz group ( not a superversion of it ) times weyl rescalings , and hence one introduces a supervielbein @xmath11 and a superconnection @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the lorentz part and @xmath14 the weyl part , and the flat superindex @xmath15 contains an so(1,10 ) vector index @xmath16 and a ( majorana ) spinor index @xmath17 .",
    "the corresponding super - two - form field strengths are ( suppressing the wedge product symbol in the product of superforms ) @xmath18 and they satisfy the ssbi @xmath19 of which only the first one will be used in this talk . note that no separate superfield corresponding to the four - form field strength is introduced since both its bianchi identity and field equation will emerge from the analysis of the torsion ssbi .    in order to obtain the form of the relaxed constraint given in ref .",
    "@xcite we expand @xmath20 in terms of irreducible tensors by means of the basis for symmetric @xmath21-matrices @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 indicate a product of @xmath26 antisymmetrised @xmath21-matrices with weight one , , @xmath27 with the understanding that the @xmath28 s can be further decomposed into irreducible tensors .",
    "in order to understand which parts of the tensors in eq .",
    "( [ aux ] ) that are relevant , one needs to eliminate redundant superfields in a systematic manner by imposing so called `` conventional constraints '' .",
    "the space does not allowed a detailed discussion  we refer instead to ref .",
    "an analysis of all the possible conventional constraints @xcite will leave only @xmath28 s in the representations 429 and 4290 in ( [ aux ] ) as we will now discuss .    turning back to the components of the supertorsion at dimension 0 given in eq .",
    "( [ aux ] ) , we note that @xmath29 decomposes into representations of dimension 65 , with dynkin label ( 20000 ) , 55 with dynkin label ( 01000 ) , and 1 with dynkin label ( 00000 ) . similarly , @xmath30 goes into 11 ( 10000 ) , 165 ( 00100 ) and 429 ( 11000 ) , and @xmath31 into 330 ( 00010 ) , 462 ( 00002 ) and 4290 ( 10002 ) .",
    "all antisymmetric tensors are set to zero . at this point",
    "we are left with the two fields which transform as 429 and 4290 under so(1,10 ) . the way these appear in the supertorsion , , in @xmath20",
    ", suggests a close connection to the m2 and m5 brane , respectively , for the 429 and 4290 .",
    "although it seems easier to deal with 429 we will in fact drop it and concentrate on the 4290 because of its probable relation to the anomaly canceling term related to the m5 brane .",
    "( the field of interest with dimension 0 , @xmath32 ( @xmath33 is the weyl tensor ) , does not contain the representation 429 . )",
    "this will have to appear in the ssbi for the four - form superfield strength which hence will read @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the eight - form polynomial in the curvature that was introduced in this context in ref . @xcite . in this talk , however , we will not take the analysis this far but instead show that the relaxed torsion constraint @xcite @xmath36 is general enough to lift the field equations coming from ( [ lagrangian ] ) .",
    "more details are found in @xcite and a more complete discussion will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the method for solving the ssbi , @xmath37 , is to extract its component equations and solve these by increasing dimension .",
    "the equation of lowest dimension , @xmath38 , is the one multiplying the three - form @xmath39 and with @xmath40 , @xmath41 where @xmath42 indicates symmetrisation of the indices ( except for the ones between bars @xmath43 ) .",
    "this equation can be decomposed into a large number of equations , each one corresponding to an irreducible tensor appearing in the decomposition of the symmetric product of three spinors times a vector , which is the tensor structure of the ssbi ( [ dimhalfssbi ] ) .",
    "when the expansions of the torsion components are inserted into these irreducible tensor equations , all irreducible tensor parts of the torsion will drop out except the ones that coincide with the representation specifying the equation .",
    "we should also mention that we restrict ourselves to a linearised analysis .",
    "a more non - linear treatment is feasible , at least in the original fields , but here the ordinary supergravity fields and the auxiliary ones are treated on equal footing . in this",
    "talk we also neglect vector derivatives on the auxiliary superfield @xmath44 .",
    "since the equation ( [ dimhalfssbi ] ) involves the fields at @xmath45 level in @xmath46 , we need to expand @xmath47 as well as the dimension 1/2 torsion components into irreducible tensors .",
    "in fact , as a consequence of using weyl superspace , with the extra conventional constraints associated with the weyl connection , we find that the torsions involved in this ssbi are uniquely determined by the components of @xmath47",
    ". thus if we set @xmath46 to zero these torsions will vanish without invoking any extra assumptions , a result that also follows from the work of howe in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this talk",
    ", we spare the reader from the exact expression for the torsion components in terms of @xmath46 .",
    "the calculation involves a certain degree of technical complexity , which is left for ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we now turn to the ssbis with dimension 1 .",
    "there are two such equations , namely @xmath48 to deal with these equations , we must expand the superfield @xmath46 at the @xmath49 level , and take into account the results already obtained at @xmath45 level .",
    "as mentioned above , we aim at showing that the introduction of the auxiliary fields generates a right - hand side of the spinor part of the equation of motion for the gravitino field . at present",
    ", we therefore only need to consider the irreducible tensors at dimension 1 whose spinorial derivative contains a spinor .",
    "these are all forms , with rank from zero to five .",
    "we state the two- and three - forms , which are the ones that will eventually survive : @xmath50 since now the curvatures entering eq .",
    "( [ dimonebi ] ) are non - zero taking values in the structure group , they must be eliminated . from the @xmath51",
    "we get the information that the symmetric traceless part in @xmath52 has to vanish , and the rest are used to eliminate @xmath53 by the structure group condition .",
    "in contrast to the equations at dimension @xmath38 , where the full representation content of the index structure of the ssbi made impact on the fields ( to the extent that the representations were present at level @xmath45 in @xmath46 ) , some equations now turn out to be linearly dependent .",
    "a naive counting of fields and equations fails , and , as we will see , this is absolutely essential in order for the auxiliary superfield to contain components entering the equations of motion .",
    "this exceptional behaviour relies on the exact form of the solutions at dimension @xmath38 , and comes at work for the three - forms , where three equations reduce to two , and for the four - forms , where all three equations are identical .",
    "the zero- , one- , two- and five - forms at second level in @xmath28 are set to zero ( modulo terms @xmath54 in the five - forms ) , and the relevant surviving part is parametrised as @xmath55}x_{a_1\\ldots a_5,b }                  \\hfill\\cr = \\g_{[a_1a_2a_3}{}^ev_{a_4a_5]be }      + \\g_{b[a_1a_2}{}^ev_{a_3a_4a_5]e }      -\\fr67\\eta_{b[a_1}\\g_{a_2a_3}{}^{e_1e_2}v_{a_4a_5]e_1e_2 }     \\hfill\\cr + \\g_{a_1\\ldots a_5}{}^{e_1e_2e_3}w_{be_1e_2e_3 }      + \\g_{b[a_1\\ldots a_4}{}^{e_1e_2e_3}w_{a_5]e_1e_2e_3 }      -\\fr67\\eta_{b[a_1 }          \\g_{a_2\\ldots a_5]}{}^{e_1\\ldots e_4}w_{e_1\\ldots e_4 }    \\hfill\\cr + \\g_{[a_1a_2a_3}v_{a_4a_5]b }      + \\g_{b[a_1a_2}v_{a_3a_4a_5 ] }      -\\fr67\\eta_{b[a_1}\\g_{a_2a_3}{}^ev_{a_4a_5]e }             \\hfill\\cr + \\g_{a_1\\ldots a_5}{}^{e_1e_2}w_{be_1e_2 }      + \\g_{b[a_1\\ldots a_4}{}^{e_1e_2}w_{a_5]e_1e_2 }      -\\fr67\\eta_{b[a_1}\\g_{a_2\\ldots a_5]}{}^{e_1e_2e_3}w_{e_1e_2e_3}\\hfill \\cr + \\ldots\\hfill\\cr } \\ ] ] with the relations @xmath56 for the four - forms , and @xmath57 for the three - forms .",
    "the linear dependence already mentioned makes us confident in these expressions . in the unmodified supergravity ( @xmath58 ) , one four - form in the dimension 1 torsion survives , and is identified with the four - form field strength @xmath59 . in the present situation",
    ", it is a priori not obvious which combination of the three surviving four - forms that should be identified with this physical field ( the criterion being that it is closed ) , and the answer to this question will have to await the solution of the ssbis at dimension 2 .    one further result at dimension 1 is that the weyl part of the curvature , @xmath60 , vanishes , as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite for the unmodified supergravity .",
    "this is a very positive sign , since it indicates that the theory even with the relaxed torsion constraints we have used to take it off - shell is equivalent to one with only the lorentz group as structure group as discussed by howe @xcite .",
    "we will comment on this further in the concluding section .",
    "finally , we consider the ssbis at dimension @xmath61 , which read @xmath62}{}^d = d_\\a t_{bc}{}^d+2d_{[b}t_{c]\\a}{}^d      + 2t_{\\a[b}{}^et_{|e|c]}{}^d+t_{bc}{}^et_{e\\a}{}^d\\komma\\hfill\\cr 2r_{a(\\b\\c)}{}^\\d = d_a t_{\\b\\c}{}^\\d+2d_{(\\b}t_{\\c)a}{}^\\d      + 2t_{a(\\b}{}^et_{|e|\\c)}{}^\\d+t_{\\b\\c}{}^et_{ea}{}^\\d\\punkt\\hfill\\cr } \\ ] ] in an unconstrained superfield in the representation 4290 , there are two spinors at level @xmath63 .",
    "the index structure of the ssbis at this level also contains two spinor equations .",
    "we have to take into account what has been learned about @xmath46 at lower levels .",
    "specifically , at dimension 1 some of the antisymmetric tensors containing a spinor at the next level vanished .",
    "miraculously , again , all of these go into the same linear combination , while the spinor coming from the three- and four - forms survives .",
    "one spinor thus remains , and goes into part of the field equation for the rarita ",
    "schwinger field , which then reads @xmath64}x_{b_1\\ldots b_5,a}\\komma\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the spinor part of the decomposition of the dim-3/2 torsion into irreducible representations : @xmath66})^\\c+(\\g_{ab}t)^\\c$ ] .",
    "also the spinor component of the weyl curvature , @xmath67 , is set to zero .",
    "these calculations involve some rather heavy @xmath68-matrix algebra which has been facilitated enormously by the development of a mathematica based program @xcite .",
    "in particular , the results in this talk rely on a large number of fierz identities which , as explained below , can be completely systematised . by using the algebraic program to compute some small number of final coefficients ,",
    "any computation requiring fierzing is easily dealt with .",
    "we have demonstrated that , through a series of seemingly miraculous numerical coincidences ( which , however , due to the similarities with ten dimensions @xcite , both regarding the constraints and the subsequent manipulations of the ssbis , one would strongly expect to occur ) , the relaxation of the torsion constraint at dimension zero is capable of accommodating an off - shell formulation . by off - shell",
    "we here simply mean that the equations of motion from ( [ lagrangian ] ) are relaxed by the introduction of a current supermultiplet , contained in the supertorsion along with the supergravity multiplet . in this sense ,",
    "the term `` on - any - shell '' might be more appropriate",
    ". however , since the non - existence of an off - shell action has to our knowledge not been proven , the possibility is not ruled out that the auxiliary fields produced by this formalism are the correct ones for the construction of such an action .",
    "we would like to stress that since the degrees of freedom contained in the eleven - dimensional supergravity multiplet describe only low - energy effective dynamics of m - theory , and this system is not supposed to be subject to quantisation , the absence of an action at this level is completely acceptable .",
    "the results are sofar partial .",
    "we have not yet investigated all equations of motion . in a following paper @xcite",
    ", we will give a more detailed account of the calculations .",
    "an obvious application of the formalism , as mentioned in the introduction , is to use it to derive higher - derivative corrections to m - theory , beginning with @xmath0 terms and their superpartners .",
    "the identification of our auxiliary field @xmath46 as a supergravity self - interaction clearly breaks weyl invariance",
    ". it is encouraging to note that the corresponding curvatures vanish , as far as our analysis goes , which indicates that the correct procedure is to restrict to the lorentz structure group in order to avoid ambiguities in the definition of weyl weights , while retaining the corresponding conventional constraints .",
    "brane dynamics in general backgrounds is most conveniently described in terms of quantities pulled back from target superspace to the world - volume .",
    "it is known that @xmath5-symmetry quite generally demands the background fields to be on - shell .",
    "this must still be true for branes in backgrounds modified by higher - derivative corrections .",
    "we believe that our formalism will be essential for such an analysis .",
    "one question arises directly : is the action for  the m2-brane still given by the same expression , @xmath69 so that the corrections come only through the pullbacks of the modified background fields , or is this form changed ?",
    "we have not discussed the superspace tensor fields in this talk , but by analysing the dimension zero identity , one realises that the equation @xmath70 demands @xmath59 to have non - vanishing components even at negative dimensions .",
    "these will appear in a @xmath5-transformation of the wz term in eq .",
    "( [ mtwoaction ] ) , but do not have any torsion counterpart to cancel .",
    "we hope to be able to come back also to this issue .",
    "finally , it would also be interesting to investigate in a strict sense whether the assumption of locality , which is implicit in our work , limits the current multiplet to self - interactions of the supergravity multiplet or whether there are traces of interactions with other m - theory states .",
