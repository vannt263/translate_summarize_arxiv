    "the seesaw mechanism  @xcite seems to provide a simple way to understand the smallness of neutrino masses .",
    "the simplest among the various seesaw mechanisms is the type - i seesaw , which requires the introduction of standard model ( sm ) gauge - singlet right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos ( @xmath3 s ) .",
    "the majorana mass @xmath4 of these rh neutrinos explicitly breaks the global @xmath5 symmetry of the sm by two units and gives rise to a light neutrino mass matrix of the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the dirac mass generated due to the neutrino yukawa couplings @xmath8 after the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "if one assumes maximal allowed values for the third - generation dirac mass @xmath9 , as is implied by certain grand unified theories such as @xmath10 , then the seesaw scale is pushed up to @xmath11 gev making it virtually inaccessible to both collider experiments at the energy frontier and other low energy searches at the intensity frontier .",
    "such naive (  dimensional counting \" ) considerations however can be misleading in the context of specific ultraviolet ( uv ) complete seesaw models where there may be dynamical suppressions of neutrino dirac masses .",
    "one class of such models that are based on the sm gauge group generally go by the name of radiative seesaw models ; see e.g.  @xcite . within the type - i seesaw framework",
    ", there exists another possibility to suppress the light neutrino masses by assigning specific textures to the dirac and majorana mass matrices in the seesaw formula  @xcite .",
    "the stability of these textures can in principle be guaranteed by enforcing some symmetries in the lepton sector .",
    "extending the sm gauge group to the left - right ( l - r ) symmetric gauge group @xmath0 provides a simple uv - complete seesaw model  @xcite . here , the rh neutrinos are a necessary part of the model and do not have to be added ` by hand ' just to implement the seesaw mechanism .",
    "an important point is that the rh neutrinos acquire a majorana mass as soon as the @xmath12 symmetry is broken at a scale @xmath13 .",
    "this is quite analogous to the way the charged fermions get masses in the sm by the higgs mechanism when the @xmath14 gauge symmetry is broken at a scale @xmath15 .",
    "the higgs field that gives mass to the rh neutrinos becomes the analogue of the 125 gev higgs boson discovered at the lhc .    in this proceedings , we focus on a new class of l - r seesaw models  @xcite , where in addition to the rh gauge bosons as well as other higgs fields , light ( tev scale ) rh neutrinos with sizable mixing with the left - handed ( lh ) neutrinos may be accessible at colliders and other low energy experiments ( for a review , see e.g.  @xcite ) . with the lhc ramping up to a higher center of mass energy @xmath16 tev and later to 14 tev",
    ", our model as well as other low scale seesaw models , should provide motivation for testing the origin of neutrino mass in the coming years .",
    "for the collider phenomenology of tev - scale lrsm , see e.g.  @xcite , and for the current experimental status , see  @xcite .",
    "such considerations should also be of interest  @xcite for setting physics goals for future higher energy colliders such as the @xmath17 or 100 tev vlhc  @xcite .",
    "it is also important to mention here that the new class of l - r seesaw models with relatively large left - right neutrino mixing can be distinguished from the minimal lrsm using different kinematic variables  @xcite .",
    "an attractive consequence of the seesaw mechanism is the possibility that it could solve another important puzzle of cosmology ,  i.e.  the origin of matter - antimatter asymmetry in our universe , via a mechanism called leptogenesis  @xcite . at the heart of this mechanism",
    "is the out - of - equilibrium decay of the rh majorana neutrinos via the decay modes @xmath18 ( where the superscript @xmath19 denotes the @xmath2-conjugate ) , which violate @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath2 , thereby dynamically generating an asymmetry in the lepton sector .",
    "this primordial lepton asymmetry undergoes thermodynamic evolution as the universe expands and finally gets converted to a baryon asymmetry via equilibrated electroweak sphaleron interactions  @xcite .",
    "the attractive aspect of this mechanism is that the _ same _ yukawa couplings @xmath8 that give rise to neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism in eq .",
    "are also responsible for the origin of matter , thus implying an intimate connection between two seemingly disparate pieces of evidence for beyond the sm physics .",
    "this beautiful idea can be tested , provided the seesaw scale , and hence , the scale at which leptogenesis takes place , is accessible to current and near future laboratory experiments .",
    "low - scale leptogenesis is possible when at least two rh majorana neutrinos have a small mass difference comparable to their decay widths , thus resonantly enhancing the @xmath22-type @xmath2 asymmetry  @xcite due to rh neutrino self - energy effects  @xcite .",
    "an important question to explore is whether it is possible to falsify the leptogenesis mechanism by laboratory experiments  @xcite . in particular",
    ", it is worth investigating if the leptogenesis mechanism works in a tev - scale realization of l - r seesaw and whether an observation of a rh gauge boson at the lhc could falsify this scenario .",
    "this problem was analyzed in detail in  @xcite and it was pointed out that the additional dilution and washout effects on the lepton asymmetry due to @xmath23-mediated @xmath24 scattering processes become important for a tev - scale l - r seesaw . since in generic versions of the seesaw model , sub - ev neutrino masses would require the dirac yukawa couplings to be @xmath25 , the washout effects would lead to an efficiency factor @xmath26 ( @xmath27 being the @xmath12 gauge coupling , which is assumed to be equal to the @xmath14 gauge coupling in the minimal scenario ) which is too small for a low - scale leptogenesis to work . through a detailed analysis of the relevant boltzmann equations , it was concluded in  @xcite that even for maximal @xmath2-asymmetry @xmath28 , the observed value of the baryon asymmetry can be explained by leptogenesis in these l - r models , only if @xmath29 tev . turning this argument around , if a positive signal for @xmath23 is observed at the lhc , this will falsify leptogenesis as a mechanism for understanding the origin of matter in l - r seesaw framework .",
    "since this is such an important issue , we have reanalyzed this  @xcite to examine the robustness of the lower bound on @xmath30 and to investigate if there exists _ any _ allowed parameter space with successful leptogenesis for smaller values of @xmath30 .",
    "we find that for the generic class of l - r seesaw models with large light - heavy neutrino mixing , successful leptogenesis requires @xmath1 tev for the maximal @xmath2 asymmetry . for illustration",
    ", we will present an explicit neutrino mass fit which satisfies the observed baryon asymmetry .",
    "the main new results presented here should supersede those reported in  @xcite .",
    "this proceedings is organized as follows : in section  [ sec2 ] , we review the basic features of the generic l - r seesaw models as well as our new l - r seesaw model with special dirac and majorana textures resulting in light neutrinos via type - i seesaw with large light - heavy neutrino mixing generated in a natural manner . in section  [ sec3 ] , we present an alternative neutrino mass fit relying on cancellations in the seesaw formula . in section  [ sec4 ] ,",
    "we discuss resonant leptogenesis in this model and the impact of a tev - scale @xmath23 on the lepton asymmetry .",
    "our conclusions are given in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "in the minimal l - r symmetric model ( lrsm ) , the fermions are assigned to the gauge group @xmath0 as follows : denoting @xmath31 and @xmath32 as the quark and lepton doublets of the @xmath33th generation respectively , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( also denoted simply by @xmath36 ) are assigned to doublets under the @xmath14 group , while @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( also denoted by @xmath39 ) as the doublets under the @xmath12 group .",
    "the higgs sector of the model can consist of one or several bidoublets @xmath40 and triplets @xmath41 : @xmath42 the gauge symmetry @xmath43 is broken by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath44 to the group @xmath45 of the sm .",
    "the lh counterpart ( @xmath46 ) to @xmath47 is not considered here , assuming that parity and @xmath12 gauge symmetry scales are decoupled . in this case , the @xmath46 fields become heavy when the discrete parity symmetry is broken , and disappear from the low energy theory  @xcite .",
    "the vev of the @xmath48 field given by @xmath49 breaks the sm gauge group to @xmath50 .",
    "the fermion masses are obtained from the following yukawa lagrangian : @xmath51 where @xmath52 ( @xmath53 being the second pauli matrix ) .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , the dirac fermion masses are given by the generic formula @xmath54 for up - type fermions , and for down - type quarks and charged leptons , it is the same formula with @xmath55 .",
    "the yukawa lagrangian ( [ yuk ] ) leads to the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath56 and the majorana mass matrix for the heavy rh neutrinos @xmath57 which go into the seesaw formula for calculating the neutrino masses and the heavy - light neutrino mixing .",
    "since the higgs sector relates the neutrino yukawa couplings with the charged - lepton ones in the lrsm , it is interesting to see how a tev - scale l - r seesaw can be realized in nature .",
    "there are essentially three ways to do so : ( i ) by choosing one set of yukawa couplings to be @xmath58 for a particular vev assignment for the bidoublet higgs fields ; ( ii ) by choosing particular symmetry - motivated textures for the yukawa couplings which ensure that the leading order seesaw contribution to neutrino masses vanish ; and ( iii ) by choosing large yukawa couplings as allowed by specific textures and invoking cancellations in the seesaw formula .",
    "the strategy ( i ) with small yukawa couplings does not lead to any new interesting phenomenology over the minimal lrsm .",
    "therefore , we will focus on strategies ( ii ) and ( iii ) in the following sections , and in particular , use strategy ( iii ) for our numerical analysis for the calculation of lepton asymmetry . a similar analysis can be performed following strategy ( ii ) as well . for the phenomenological implications of this new class of l - r seesaw models ,",
    "see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , the basic strategy for understanding small neutrino masses with a low - scale type - i seesaw is to have the appropriate textures for @xmath7 and @xmath4 in eq .  .",
    "there are several examples of this type  @xcite in the context of the minimal seesaw extensions of the sm . here",
    ", we discuss the embedding of one such texture ( from ref .",
    "@xcite ) in the l - r model using an appropriate family symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the symmetry must not only guarantee the special leptonic textures but also must be free of light scalar bosons which can result if the effect of the discrete symmetry is to automatically lead to a @xmath59 symmetry . moreover in lrsm , the charged - lepton mass matrix @xmath60 is related to @xmath7 which puts additional constraints on phenomenological viability of the model . therefore , we find it remarkable that the model presented below remains a viable tev - scale l - r type - i seesaw model for neutrinos , and as a result , has interesting phenomenological implications beyond the minimal lrsm .",
    "the dirac and majorana mass matrices @xmath7 and @xmath4 considered here have the following form : @xmath61 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in the limit of @xmath64 ,",
    "the neutrino masses vanish , although the heavy - light mixing parameters given by @xmath65 can be quite large .",
    "the light neutrino masses given by the seesaw formula become proportional to either @xmath66 , @xmath67 or their products .",
    "if the smallness of @xmath67 and @xmath66 can be guaranteed by some symmetry , then we have a `` natural '' tev - scale seesaw model with tiny neutrino masses .",
    "as we show below , the mass textures   can be successfully embedded into the l - r framework , while satisfying all current experimental constraints .",
    "note that the choice of texture for the rh neutrino mass matrix in eq .   is necessary to keep the model compatible with strong bounds from tree - level @xmath68 decay via tev - scale @xmath47 exchange  @xcite . in order to obtain the special dirac and majorana textures given in eq .",
    ", we supplement the l - r gauge group @xmath0 with a global discrete symmetry @xmath69  @xcite . for the higgs sector , we choose three bi - doublets ( @xmath70 ) with @xmath71 and two rh triplets ( @xmath72 ) with @xmath73 . the fermion and higgs multiplets are assigned the @xmath74 quantum numbers as shown in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the leptonic part of the yukawa lagrangian invariant under the @xmath74-symmetry is given by @xmath75 in the symmetry limit , the vevs of @xmath76 have the form @xmath77 .",
    "this is because the terms of the form tr@xmath78 which would change the @xmath48 vev to the form diag@xmath79 are forbidden by the @xmath74-symmetry from appearing in the scalar potential .",
    "thus in the symmetry limit , the @xmath7 elements in one column are big and non - zero , and the charged lepton mass matrix has one eigenvalue zero which can be identified as the electron flavor .",

    "therefore , only the yukawa coupling matrix @xmath96 determines the flavor effect in rh neutrino interactions relevant to resonant leptogenesis .",
    "the rh neutrino mixing effect at resonance can be captured by the one - loop resummed yukawa couplings  @xcite .",
    "explicitly , in the heavy - neutrino mass eigenbasis , we obtain for the resummed yukawa couplings @xmath97 and their @xmath2-conjugates @xmath98 the following values : @xmath99 the heavy neutrino decay rates for the yukawa - mediated two - body processes @xmath100 are calculated with these resummed yukawa couplings : @xmath101 which are crucial parameters for the calculation of lepton asymmetry , as we will see in the next section .",
    "as eluded to above , for low scale seesaw models , a simple way to generate enough lepton asymmetry is to use resonant leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "it requires at least two rh neutrinos to be nearly degenerate , which is guaranteed in our model by the choice of the texture in the rh neutrino mass matrix given by eq .  .",
    "thus , in addition to guaranteeing suppression of lepton flavor violating processes such as @xmath102 , this choice of rh neutrino texture also provides a necessary condition for resonant leptogenesis .",
    "as far as the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath7 is concerned , we choose the pattern given in eq .",
    "so that it fits neutrino oscillation data . since our focus is on the feasibility of low scale leptogenesis in a realistic model for neutrinos , we do not stress here on the naturalness of the texture , although a similar exercise can be performed with the fit presented in section  [ sec2.1 ] .",

    "<S> contrary to the common lore based on naive dimensional analysis , the seesaw scale for neutrino masses can be _ naturally _ in the tev range , with small parameters coming from radiative corrections . </S>",
    "<S> we present one such class of type - i seesaw models , based on the left - right gauge group @xmath0 realized at the tev scale , which fits the observed neutrino oscillation parameters as well as other low energy constraints . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how the small parameters of this scenario can arise naturally from one loop effects . </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino fits in this model use quasi - degenerate heavy majorana neutrinos , as also required to explain the matter - antimatter asymmetry in our universe via resonant leptogenesis mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the constraints implied by the dynamics of this mechanism on the mass of the right - handed gauge boson in this class of models with enhanced neutrino yukawa couplings compared to the canonical seesaw model and find a lower bound of @xmath1 tev for successful leptogenesis assuming maximal @xmath2 asymmetry for each flavor . </S>",
    "<S> we also present a model with explicit neutrino mass fit , where the lower bound goes up to 13.1 tev due to less than maximal primordial @xmath2 asymmetry predicted by the model . </S>"
