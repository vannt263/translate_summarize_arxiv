    "the presence of extended defects in crystalline solids , such as grain boundaries and cracks , can dramatically affect their mechanical response .",
    "for example , in large - grained polycrystalline materials , grain boundaries may sometimes impede dislocation motion with a concomitant increase in yield strength , @xcite while sharp cracks are stress concentrators that may initiate material fracture @xcite . from a micromechanical point of view",
    ", the elastic fields associated with grain boundaries or cracks lead to defect interactions that influence fracture behavior in highly - flawed systems and solute segregation@xcite , thereby affecting strengthening or embrittling mechanisms .    calculations of extended defect interaction energies most often begin with the solution of the appropriate elastic boundary value problem , followed by the construction of the corresponding energy density in terms of the stress ( or strain ) fields and elastic constants and the integration of this density over some volume of space .",
    "an alternative approach to the defect interaction problem follows from a micromechanical model of the defect and is based in the elastic green function of the medium .",
    "such an approach was pioneered by mura and others @xcite , and will be applied here to defects that may be regarded , in some limit , as composed of elemental straight dislocations . as will be seen below",
    ", this formalism permits the straightforward calculation of interaction energies for different extended defects and , moreover , facilitates an intuitive , multipole - based analysis that reveals their asymptotic dependence on defect separation .",
    "we address in this paper two prototypical systems : grain boundaries and cracks , as these defects can often be modeled in terms of spatial distributions of line defects , the former typically by regular array(s ) of straight dislocations each having a constant burgers vector , and the latter by a continuous , localized distribution of dislocations with a burgers vector density depends upon loading conditions .",
    "thus , the eigenstrains corresponding to each defect are conveniently expressed in terms of a dislocation density tensor that embodies the relevant defect length scales and separations .",
    "for the purposes of illustration we consider the energetics of a low - angle tilt boundary , the interaction between tilt boundaries , the energetics of an array of cracks , and the interaction between an isolated crack and a grain boundary .",
    "the application of this approach to other , related examples is then discussed .",
    "as indicated above , our calculations are facilitated by describing a defect ( e.g. , grain boundary , crack ) in terms of a dislocation density tensor , @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this solenoidal , second - rank tensor carries both local burgers vector and line direction information , with a divergenceless condition that is a consequence of the topological constraint of line continuity . for example , the components of the density tensors corresponding to straight edge and screw dislocations at @xmath1 with burgers vectors @xmath2 , and line directions along @xmath3 are given , respectively , by @xmath4 note that , in the first equation , it is assumed that the burgers vector is aligned either along @xmath5 or @xmath6 , and so an arbitrary alignment in the plane may be constructed from appropriate linear combinations .",
    "@xmath7 is the dirac delta function .",
    "the elastic energy of the system @xmath8 $ ] can be written as a functional of @xmath0 , as shown by kosevich and others @xcite and , more recently , has been employed by nelson and toner @xcite to investigate the effect of unbound dislocation motion on shear response in solids , by rickman and vials @xcite to model the collective motion of dislocation ensembles , and by rickman and lesar @xcite to quantify the temperature dependent interaction of fluctuating dislocation lines . for our purposes , it is convenient to express the energy functional for an elastically isotropic medium with shear modulus @xmath9 and poisson ratio @xmath10 as the fourier integral @xmath11 = \\frac{\\mu}{2 ( 2\\pi)^{3 } } \\ ; \\int d^{3}q \\ ;   \\frac{1}{q^{2 } } \\ ;   k_{ijkl}(\\vec{q } ) \\ ;   \\tilde{\\rho}_{ij}(\\vec{q } ) \\ ; \\tilde{\\rho}_{kl}(-\\vec{q } ) , \\ ] ] where the integration is over reciprocal space ( tilde denoting a fourier transform ) , the kernel ( without defect core energy contributions ) is given by @xmath12 , \\ ] ] and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are longitudinal and transverse projection operators , defined by @xmath15 respectively @xcite , where @xmath16 is the kronecker delta , and @xmath17 is the levi - civita tensor .",
    "we note that it is possible to include defect core energies in a somewhat _ ad hoc _ fashion by augmenting this kernel by a term quadratic in the dislocation density @xcite a somewhat more realistic description of the core could be given by an energy term that depends on atomic coordinates , although we will not consider such core models as they fall outside of the mesoscopic description outlined here .",
    "as illustrated below , the distance dependence of the defect energy can be determined in a straightforward manner from eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy1 ] ) by employing a superposition of prototypical densities .",
    "consider first a linear array of @xmath18 edge dislocations , each separated from its nearest neighbor by @xmath19 and having a burgers vector aligned along either the @xmath5 or @xmath6 axes ( @xmath20 = 1 or 2 , respectively ) , as shown in fig .",
    "as is well known , this system , with @xmath22 and in the limit @xmath23 , is a model of a low - angle tilt grain boundary where , in the limit of small grain misorientation angle @xmath24 , @xmath25 @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy1 ] ) the dislocation density is @xmath26 where the summation is over all dislocations in the array . for convenience",

    "b. ) two such grain boundaries separated by a distance @xmath29.,title=\"fig : \" ]    before calculating the corresponding boundary energy , we note that singularities inherent in this continuum model that lacks a short distance cut - off lead to a divergent self - energy .",
    "the origin of the divergence is the fact that the energy density of a single edge dislocation diverges like @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the radial distance to the dislocation line .",
    "in reality , each dislocation has an atomic core region that is not amenable to a continuum description .",
    "we introduce a small cutoff parameter @xmath32 representing the core radius by replacing the real - space delta function by the broadened delta representation @xcite @xmath33 the corresponding fourier transform can be obtaining by using the shifting property of transforms to obtain @xmath34 therefore the elastic energy of the array of edge dislocations is @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath20 = 1 or 2 ( no summation ) denotes the orientation of the burgers vectors .",
    "more specifically , noting that @xmath37 , @xmath38 and the energy per unit length in the @xmath3 direction is given by @xmath39 where a structure factor @xmath40 has been defined as @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "explicitly we have @xmath42    upon evaluating the first integral in eq .",

    "if this array represents a planar defect ( i.e. , grain boundary ) then the corresponding energy per unit boundary area is @xmath46}.\\ ] ] this result has the same functional form as the classic read - shockley energy for a low - angle tilt boundary , though the constant in the argument of the logarithm depends on the details of the short - range ( core ) cutoff employed here @xcite . in this regard",
    ", we note that a similar approach to this problem for two - dimensional systems has been outlined elsewhere @xcite .",
    "finally we examine @xmath47 for the extended defect for which @xmath48 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ener ] ) it is clear that @xmath49 owing to the divergence associated with the @xmath50 = 0 mode .",
    "this result is expected since some components of the long - ranged stress field ( namely @xmath51 ) tend to a constant as @xmath52 , and thus the volume integral over the energy density diverges in an infinite system . given this behavior , it is evident that a low - angle boundary with this geometry can not have dislocations with burgers vector components in the boundary plane .",
    "consider next two low - angle , symmetric , tilt boundaries separated by a distance @xmath29 , as shown in fig . @xmath21b .",

    "the resulting summations can also be performed to yield the grain - boundary interaction energy per unit area @xmath58 } \\right]\\ ] ] it is of interest to examine @xmath59 for two limiting cases .",
    "first , for large boundary separations such that @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 . this exponential decay in the interaction energy follows from the rapid ( exponential ) decay of the stress fields associated with the individual arrays .",
    "by contrast , for @xmath63 , the logarithmic dependence of @xmath64 on @xmath65 results from individual dislocations in either array seeing \" each other . finally , we note that an alternative route to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gbint ] ) follows from a calculation of the peach - koehler force acting on a dislocation owing to a distant array and a subsequent spatial integration to obtain the energy.@xcite      another application of the formalism presented above is the interaction energy between cracks .",
    "we first consider a single crack of length @xmath66 oriented along the @xmath5 axis , and model it as a continuous dislocation distribution , with corresponding dislocation function @xmath67 .",
    "@xcite the burgers vectors of the dislocations that comprise the crack model embody the local crack opening that results from a given loading .",
    "hence , by choosing an appropriate dislocation distribution , one can represent loading in various modes .",
    "having represented the crack with a dislocation distribution , the stress field associated with the crack is given in terms of the stress field of a single edge dislocation @xmath68 by the convolution integral @xmath69 as a specific example , consider a mode ii crack .",
    "the shear loading associated with this mode can be represented by a distribution of edge dislocations with burgers vectors oriented along @xmath5 .",
    "thus , one can write @xmath70 for an appropriate dislocation density @xmath71 that can be determined from the requirement that the crack faces must be traction - free.@xcite    it is of interest here to consider a crack interacting with distant objects .",
    "in particular , given an observation point @xmath72 such that @xmath73 , it is permissible to regard the crack fields as produced by the lowest - order multipole moments of @xmath67 . in practice , the monopole `` and dipole '' moments are often satisfactory in this context and one obtains @xmath74 and , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the total burgers vector associated with the crack dislocations and @xmath77 is the shear stress loading the crack.@xcite     along the @xmath6 axis . it is assumed that the system is subjected to a constant shear stress @xmath78 .",
    "also shown is a schematic of the dislocation distribution corresponding to each crack . ]",
    "we now derive the interaction energy associated with various crack arrays .",
    "consider , for example , a linear array of mode ii cracks , each crack closed at both ends ( i.e. , @xmath79 ) and modeled as a dislocation dipole in the @xmath6 direction that is separated from its nearest neighbor by @xmath19 .",
    "as is evident from eq .",
    "( [ eq : moment2 ] ) , and by contrast with the grain - boundary models discussed above , the strength of elemental defects ( i.e. , their dipole moment ) is not fixed , as it depends on the local stress field . the geometry for this loading , as well as the corresponding dislocation orientations , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] . in the short crack limit ,",
    "such that each crack may be regarded as a point dipole with moment @xmath80 ( i.e. , the limit @xmath81 and @xmath82 with @xmath83 ) , the corresponding dislocation density tensor is @xmath84 where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to the argument , and the subscript @xmath19 indicates that the dipole moment depends on crack separation . as before , it is convenient to work in reciprocal space where one finds that @xmath85    by analogy with the development given above , the energy of this system is given by @xmath86 upon performing the required integral and summation , one finds that @xmath87^{2}}.\\ ] ] it is of interest to examine @xmath88 in the limit of large crack separations @xmath19 where the dipole approximation works best .",
    "one finds that @xmath89\\ ; \\left[1/a^{2 } - 4 \\pi^{2}/3 \\ell^{2 } +   o(1/\\ell^{4 } ) \\right]$ ] , the first term arising from the self - energy of a dislocation dipole , and the second arising from dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "an approximation to @xmath80 for a particular array spacing @xmath19 may be obtained by requiring that the shear stress traction produced by neighboring cracks on the face of a given crack be compensated by a uniform stress that is the same for every crack in the array . the strategy for such calculations",
    "is given elsewhere @xcite , and the details for this defect geometry are given in appendix @xmath90 .",
    "as a final illustration of extended defect energy calculations , consider the interaction of a low - angle grain boundary separated from an isolated crack by a distance @xmath29 , as shown schematically in fig . @xmath91 .",
    "for this geometry the normal stress on the crack faces owing to the boundary is @xmath92 , while the shear stresses @xmath93 , and so the crack is loaded in mode ii . from the grain - boundary ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : denstiltft ] ) ) and crack ( eq . (",
    "[ eq : denscrackft ] ) ) dislocation densities one can then construct the interaction energy per unit dislocation length , namely @xmath94     from the boundary and at @xmath95 .",
    "for this geometry the crack is subjected to shear stresses owing to the grain boundary . ]",
    "evaluating the integrals and the summation , we find that @xmath96.\\ ] ] in the limit of @xmath97 , @xmath98}$ ] , owing to the exponential decay of the stress fields associated with the grain boundary while , for @xmath99 ( and @xmath100 ) @xmath101 , consistent with a monopole - dipole interaction .",
    "we note that this result can be obtained somewhat more readily by returning to the calculation of the grain boundary interaction energy and considering a single dislocation within a grain boundary array .",
    "since a crack is modeled here as a dislocation dipole one replaces , in effect , an edge dislocation density with its spatial derivative and therefore the functional form of the crack / boundary interaction energy is given by @xmath102 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : gbint ] ) ) .",
    "the crack dipole moment @xmath103 can again be determined from the shear loading conditions via eq .",
    "( [ eq : moment2 ] ) . for the crack geometry shown in fig .",
    "@xmath91 , this leads to @xmath104^{-1 } , \\ ] ] where the shear stress is that for an array of edge dislocation .",
    "@xcite this integral can be evaluated numerically by a gauss - chebyshev integration technique based on type ii chebyshev polynomials .",
    "a unified framework for the calculation of defect energies has been presented here and , for the purposes of illustration , applied to several different systems containing grain boundaries and/or cracks . in each case , a set of elemental dislocations comprise the extended defect under consideration , and the corresponding dislocation density is either independent of other defect positions ( e.g. , grain boundary ) or calculable from the stresses imposed by these other defects ( e.g. , crack ) .",
    "as indicated above , this approach is especially useful in providing an intuitive understanding of interactions based on idealized defect models .",
    "the foregoing development can , of course , be applied to other systems for which a dislocation - based model is appropriate .",
    "for example , one can also obtain the energetics of a roughened tilt boundary @xcite by considering perturbations of the dislocation density resulting from sinusoidal variations in the position of constituent dislocation lines .",
    "if these variations in boundary morphology are temperature induced , this analysis can be used to compute the statistical weights of perturbed boundary configurations to the free energy of the system and , consequently , to deduce a thermodynamic roughening temperature .",
    "in addition , the description of more complex , asymmetrical boundary structures , consisting of two or three sets of edge dislocations , or twist boundaries consisting of perpendicular sets of screw dislocations is also possible by a generalization of the structure factor ( see below eq .",
    "( [ eq : enstrfac ] ) ) to include a form factor that reflects the positions of the basis dislocations within a unit cell that generates the boundary .",
    "these and other calculations will be the subject of a future publication .    finally , we mention that , for the sake of completeness , appendix @xmath105 contains expressions for the stress tensor in the same fourier representation used here for the energy , along with some simple examples . in a future publication , we will apply a similar formalism as used for the energy to derive equations for the stress arising from extended defects .",
