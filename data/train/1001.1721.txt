    "a phenomenon of critical adsorption occurs when a fluid is brought to its bulk critical point in the presence of an attractive substrate or wall , for example , along the critical isochore .",
    "the wall causes a perturbation of the relevant order parameter profile to extend over a distance @xmath0 , the bulk correlation length , from the surface @xcite .",
    "close to criticality , where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the critical exponent ) , the influence of the wall extends to macroscopic distances . as a result",
    "the amount adsorbed ( adsorption @xmath3 ) diverges as @xmath4 . here",
    "we focus on the equivalent phenomenon that occurs for binary liquid mixtures near their consolute points . in these systems , generically there is a preferential adsorption of one component of the mixture on the wall surfaces , resulting in the divergence of the relative adsorption near the critical point .",
    "critical adsorption was much studied both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "of interest has been the scaling prediction by fisher and de gennes @xcite that @xmath3 should have a power law dependence on @xmath5 , with a universal exponent which does not depend on the details of the specific system . also , this phenomenon is of significant practical importance , e.g. , for the use of supercritical fluids in micro- and nanofluidics @xcite and as solvents in colloidal suspensions @xcite",
    ".    in colloidal suspensions one usually encounters the presence of ions .",
    "this may be due to the dissociation of a salt - free solvent , e.g. , in binary solvents containing water , or due to dissolved salt .",
    "ions influence the electrostatic interactions between the charged colloids leading to screening effects @xcite .",
    "if there is a chemical preference of ions for one component of the solvent , then larger amount of ions may be dissolved in regions where the concentration of the preferred component of the solvent is larger .",
    "for this reason critical adsorption in binary solvents may affect the distribution of ions near charged surfaces .",
    "this effect in turn may influence the screening of electrostatic interactions between charged colloidal particles .",
    "such a scenario is relevant for an experimental system used recently to investigate the effective forces acting on spherical particles close to a substrate immersed in a near - critical water - lutidine mixture @xcite .",
    "the aim of that study was to measure directly a critical casimir force between a single spherical colloid and a flat surface .",
    "polystyrene particles with high surface charge density were used as colloids , and silica glass treated chemically to achieve the desired adsorption properties , which also carried some surface charge , was used as the substrate .",
    "ions in solution were present due to dissociation in the salt - free water - lutidine mixture . in order to extract the critical casimir force from the measured potentials of interactions , the distances @xmath6 from the substrate for which",
    "the electrostatic contribution was estimated to be negligible have been considered .",
    "the estimation of the electrostatic interactions was based on measurements of the electrostatic potential far from the critical point . however , different solubilities of ions in water and lutidine and the enhancement of one of components of the near - critical mixture close to the surfaces might result in a change of the screening of the electrostatic interaction compared to the case of a noncritical homogeneous medium . unfortunately",
    ", possible effects of the critical adsorption on the electrostatic contribution to the interaction potential could not be estimated due to the lack of any theoretical predictions for such effects .",
    "motivated by these issues in the present paper we study critical adsorption in a simple generic system , i.e. , for a binary mixture solvent containing ionic solutes in the presence of a single charged planar wall that preferentially adsorbs one component of the solvent .",
    "recently , the properties of _ bulk _ near - critical binary mixtures with ions have been studied theoretically using a modified poisson - boltzmann theory by onuki and kitamura @xcite .",
    "the landau - ginzburg functional was used to describe the binary solvent .",
    "the presence of ions was accounted for by including electrostatic contribution and the terms due to the entropy of ions .",
    "preferential solvation effects were modeled by a linear coupling between the density of ions and the order parameter of near - critical binary mixture . using this phenomenological functional in the mean - field approximation",
    ", the authors found that the presence of ions shifts the critical point of demixing .",
    "this result is consistent with the well known experimental observations that adding salt to the binary mixture solvent changes the position of its phase separation curve , such that the upper and lower critical points are shifted upwards  @xcite and downwards  @xcite , respectively .    if the ion - containing mixtures are exposed to external electric fields , e.g. , due to charged walls or charged macromolecules immersed in the solution , the phase separation temperature is also shifted @xcite .",
    "in addition to the preferential solvation , a dielectric inhomogeneity is important for this effect ; the high permittivity solvent component is attracted to the charged surface thus enhancing the phase separation .",
    "recently , the effects of these , so called , dielectrophoretic forces and of the preferential solvation have been studied for ion - containing mixtures confined between two - charged surfaces in a single phase region _",
    "away _ from the coexistence @xcite .",
    "the approach used for a bulk system in ref .",
    "@xcite have been modified to account for a spatial variation of the volume fractions and , consequently , of the dielectric permittivity of the binary mixture .",
    "in addition , a surface term describing the interactions between the charged solutes and confining charged surfaces has been included . using a mean - field approximation the density profiles and osmotic pressure between charged interfaces",
    "have been calculated .    in order to investigate the influence of critical adsorption of ion - containing binary mixtures on the distribution of ions near a single charged wall , we propose here an approach that starts from the microscopic theory .",
    "within such an approach the landau functional is derived rather than postulated , and it should describe correctly all the collective phenomena in the system that are consistent with the assumed interaction potentials .",
    "hence , we can control all the assumptions on the fundamental level of interactions . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : constr ] we introduce the lattice - gas model of a four - component mixture describing two species of the solvent and the positive and negative ions .",
    "the generic for this model , short - ranged interactions between all the species and between the species and the surface are assumed . from the lattice model we derive the continuum landau - ginzburg functional which is then supplemented by electrostatic bulk and surface contributions .",
    "contrary to previous approaches all parameters of our functional are expressed in terms of microscopic interactions .",
    "our landau functional is similar to the functionals in refs .",
    "@xcite , but more terms are present , and all the approximations are based on assumptions concerning types of interparticle interactions . in sec .",

    "it takes into account electrostatic interactions and the preferential solvation .",
    "the coupling constants appearing in this extended landau - ginzburg theory are given explicitly in terms of thermodynamic quantities , the temperature , the mean composition of solvent , the mean density of ions , and the interaction parameters @xmath37 characterizing the lattice - gas model of a mixture .",
    "we have assumed that ions are of similar chemical nature .",
    "the main difference between our functional and the functional studied in ref.@xcite is the presence of the term @xmath280 and terms @xmath281 and @xmath282 in ( [ functional ] ) , which result from short - range interaction potentials .",
    "these terms lead to the mixing of the fields @xmath83 and @xmath84 in the critical order parameter . in the semi - infinite system",
    "these terms are important for the form of the profile of the field @xmath84 , and through the coupling of @xmath84 with the charge density @xmath176 in the entropy term , they influence the charge profile @xmath283 . in our approach ,",
    "direct couplings between the charge and the concentration are disregarded , but such coupling would be present in the case of ions of different chemical nature ( compare eqs.([hsr ] ) and ( [ hsr1 ] ) ) .",
    "mean - field theory for our landau - ginzburg model yields the shift of the critical point of the demixing transition with respect to the case of binary solvents without ions .",
    "the direction of the shift depends on the relative strength of the ions - solvent and solvent - solvent interaction parameters @xmath284 and @xmath285 , and is positive for @xmath286 .",
    "the linearized el equations in the presence of a charged wall do not lead to the effect of the concentration profiles on the charge distribution .",
    "we treat nonlinear effects using a perturbation expansion , which gives the simple expression for the leading correction to the solution of the linearized el eqs.([ra ] ) and ( [ r ] ) .",
    "the ratio between the next - to - leading and leading terms is proportional to the amplitude @xmath245 of the decay of the ion density , @xmath287 , and otherwise depends only on the dominant lengths in the system , the bulk correlation length @xmath288 and the debye screening length @xmath289 .",
    "we find that due to the critical adsorption of that component of the solvent in which the ions are preferentially dissolved , the amount of counterions in the layer near the charged surface of the thickness of the debye screening length is increased with respect to the one away from the critical point .",
    "critical adsorption of the better solvent enhances screening whereas the critical adsorption of the poorer solvent leads to the opposite effect .",
    "this approach is quantitatively valid provided the debye screening length is large , the surface - charge density is small , and the surface fields are weak .",
    "we expect the same trend beyond the approximate perturbation expansion solution .",
    "this will be studied further by the numerical treatment of the full el equations .",
    "we should note that our theory shows that the leading - order correction to the debye - hckel form of the charge profile is determined by the average dielectric constant , i.e. , the spatial variation of the dielectric constant can be neglected when @xmath290 ( in units of inverse molecular size ) .",
    "finally , the change of the charge distribution near the charged surface occuring upon approaching the critical point of the binary solvent , indicates that in the confining geometries , i.e. , for systems between two surfaces , the effective interactions between the confining surfaces will be altered .",
    "our predictions will be tested in the future work by explicit calculations and by comparison with the experimental data of ref .",
