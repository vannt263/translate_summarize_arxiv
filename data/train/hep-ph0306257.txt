    "it is generally assumed that our galaxy is embedded in a halo of dark matter particles ( wimps ) with energy density @xmath1 gev/@xmath2 and velocities distributed according to a maxwellian distribution with parameter @xmath3 ( defined as @xmath4 ) and cut - off velocity equal to the escape velocity in the galaxy ( @xmath5 km / s ) .    the recoil spectrum produced by wimp - nucleus scattering in a target detector",
    "is expected to show the so - called annual modulation effect , due to the earth s motion around the sun @xcite . along the year , the earth s velocity with respect to the galactic reference frame ( @xmath6 ) varies according to a cosinus law .",
    "it is customary to express the earth s velocity in units of the parameter @xmath3 defined above .",
    "the adimensional quantity @xmath7 shows the following time - dependence : @xmath8 where the amplitude of the modulated component ( @xmath9 is small compared to the annual average @xmath10 .",
    "the period and phase of the cosinus function are known to be @xmath11/t ( t= 1 year ) and @xmath12 june .    in this framework ,",
    "the expected countrate of wimp interactions can be written ( first order taylor approximation ) : @xmath13 where @xmath14 $ ] is the time - independent part and @xmath15 is the amplitude of the modulated signal .    both @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    "depend on the wimp mass @xmath18 and on the wimp cross section on proton @xmath19 , as well as on many astrophysical parameters ( @xmath3 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) and some properties of the target material .",
    "a calculation of the expected count rate r from wimp interactions in a germanium detector as a function of the recoil energy @xmath22 can be performed following the formula given in ref.@xcite : @xmath23 where : @xmath24 and the variables @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are listed in table [ tab1 ] together with the values of the parameters used in the calculation .",
    "the wimp cross section on germanium @xmath28 can be easily related to the correspondant cross section on proton ; in the case of spin - independent interaction ( si ) , the conversion formula is ( see @xcite and @xcite ) : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the reduced mass and @xmath31 .",
    ".relevant astrophysical and detector parameters : their expressions and the values used in the present work . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the distribution of @xmath32 for the modulated data - set shows no substantial variation when we move the left limit of the energy interval where we integrate the signal ( @xmath33 ) from 4 kev to 8 kev .",
    "increasing @xmath33 above 8 kev , the mean value of the distribution slowly decreases ; this is an indication that we are missing part of the signal that , as we recall here , is concentrated in the lower energy bins .",
    "for this reason is of primary importance to have a low experimental threshold .",
    "we have repeated the same simulation for different wimp masses and the same cross section ; in tab .",
    "( [ tab2 ] ) we report , for different measuring times , the mean value of the @xmath32 distribution ( for the modulated data - set ) together with the corresponding confidence level @xmath34 .      calculating the value of the above mentioned estimators @xmath32 and @xmath35 is not the only way to discover the modulation hidden in the data .",
    "given our set of experimental data , we can try to extract directly the value of @xmath17 , the amplitude of the modulated signal , as a function of the energy .",
    "following @xcite , we can write : @xmath36 ^ 2 s_i}}{n }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where n is the running time of the experiment and @xmath37 is no more integrated over a broad energy region but in small energy bins ( 1 or 2 kev ) . in this way it is possible to measure the amplitude of the modulated signal and its error for each energy bin ( of the given size ) and moreover , taking small energy bins",
    "we avoid the problem of the cross - over energy .",
    "in picture ( [ sm_picture ] ) we report a tipical result for the amplitude of the modulated signal @xmath17 as calculated using ( [ sm ] ) on the simulated data without and with modulation ( @xmath18 = 40 gev and @xmath38 pb ) .",
    "the energy region between 4 and 50 kev has been divided in 2 kev energy bins and for each one the value of @xmath17 and the corresponding error have been calculated .    by looking at the two pictures ( note the different scales on the @xmath39 axis ) ,",
    "we see how the distribution b represents an indication of an annual modulation amplitude @xmath40 . in the case with modulation ( b )",
    "all the data points are compatible within the error with the theoretical signal while in the case where no modulation is present ( a ) the same points are distributed around zero .",
    "the big errors are due to the low statistic and become smaller if we increase the measuring time .    averaging the signal in the region from 4 to 16 kev",
    ", we obtain in the case of modulation : @xmath41 counts / kev day , while in the case of no modulation we have : @xmath42 counts / kev day , compatible with the hypothesis @xmath43 .",
    "one of the general procedures to treat experimental data when searching for the annual modulation effect is to use the maximum - likelihood method .",
    "the likelihood function @xmath44 for a set of experimental rates @xmath45 , assuming that they are poisson - distributed , is : @xmath46 since @xmath47 depends on the parameters of interest @xmath18 and @xmath48 , through the expressions of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , it is possible to obtain the best - fit value for the parameters minimizing @xmath51 , or better the function : @xmath52 where the constant contains the components that do not depend on @xmath18 and @xmath48 .",
    "the minimization of @xmath53 is not an easy operation : if we want to keep as a free parameter the number of background counts in each energy bin ( and here we consider as background the number of counts due to the time - independent component of the signal ( @xmath16 + @xmath54 ) ) we have to deal with many parameters .",
    "the usual procedure is to carry out the minimization in two steps . as a first step we minimize with respect to the time - independent component @xmath55 . during this minimization",
    "the condition @xmath56 , @xmath57 is imposed . as a second step",
    "we minimize with respect to @xmath48 and @xmath18 requiring , as is usual done : @xmath58 we did not impose limits or conditions on the parameters @xmath48 and @xmath18 except that both have to be greater than zero .",
    "we have carried out the minimization procedure on the data set simulated under the mentioned hypothesis @xmath18 = 40 gev and @xmath38 pb , in the energy range from 5 to 40 gev .",
    "after the first step we obtain the values of the quantity @xmath55 for each energy bin : we have plotted that result in fig .",
    "( [ f_k ] ) and this reproduces exactly the curve @xmath59 that we have used in the simulation .    in the second step",
    "we obtain the best - fit values for the parameters of interest .",
    "the minimization procedure converged for the selected energy window , giving the following best - fit values for the fit parameters : @xmath60 the value of the wimp mass is in excellent agreement with the real one used in the sumulation ; the value of the cross section , though compatible within 1 @xmath61 with the true value , shows a lower agreement : this can be due to the fact that @xmath18 influences the shape of the wimp spectrum while @xmath48 appears only as a multiplying factor .",
    "we repeated the fitting procedure assuming different values of the energy threshold of the experiment ( 3 and 4 kev ) , finding very little difference from the given best - fit .",
    "the set of best - fit values ( [ best - fit ] ) corresponds to the 2 @xmath61 allowed region shown in fig .",
    "( [ region ] ) .",
    "this region of the plane @xmath62 has been calculated using : @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 being the result of the fitting procedure .",
    "[ region ] should be interpreted in this way : if a wimp exists with the properties assumed so far , we can point out its presence within two years of measurement ( 80 kg y significance ) and give the result in fig .",
    "[ region ] for the 2 @xmath61 allowed region for the relevant parameters .",
    "the annual modulation , due to the motion of the earth with respect to the galactic halo , is the main signature of a possible wimp signal .",
    "the effect is supposed to be small , only a few percent of the total dark matter signal , and therefore very difficult to extract . a positive indication of this modulation has been found over the past five years by the dama experiment and it would be of great importance to look for the same effect with another experiment , expecially in the region of the wimp parameter s space indicated by the dama results .",
    "the genius - tf experiment @xcite , born as a prototype for the genius project , is at present under installation at the gran sasso national laboratory . with a mass of 40 kg and a background of 4 counts/(kg y kev ) ,",
    "genius - tf can be used to look for dark matter , not only through the direct detection of wimp - induced nuclear recoils , but also through the annual modulation of the experimental rate .",
    "genius - tf will be - in addition to dama @xcite - the _ only _ experiment which will be able to probe the annual modulation signature in a foreseeable future .",
    "the at present much discussed cryo detector experiments , such as cdms @xcite , cresst @xcite , edelweiss @xcite have no chance to do this because the mass projected to be in operation in these experiments is by far too low ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we have developed a set of routines and tools to look for the annual modulation effect with our genius - tf experiment using different analysis methods discussed in the literature .",
    "we have analysed data simulated under the hypothesis of modulation , using three different approaches ( modulation significance , direct calculation of the modulation amplitude @xmath66 and maximum likelihood fit of the data ) and we have shown that the mass and the low background level of genius - tf will allow us test , within few years of measurements , low wimp masses and wimp cross sections in the region of interest indicated by the dama experiment .",
