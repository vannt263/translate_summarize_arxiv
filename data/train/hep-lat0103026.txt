    "the anisotropic lattice has become an important tool in lattice qcd simulations . with a small temporal lattice spacing  @xmath2",
    "one can more easily follow the time evolution of correlators , while keeping the spatial lattice spacing  @xmath3 comparatively modest  @xcite .",
    "this approach is especially effective when the signal - to - noise ratio deteriorates quickly , as , for example , in the case of glueballs  @xcite .",
    "the better signal - to - noise ratio is beneficial also for heavy quark systems  @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is hoped that the anisotropy can be exploited to reduce lattice artifacts  @xcite , which are a special concern with heavy quarks .    in current work on heavy quarks ,",
    "lattice artifacts are controlled with non - relativistic  qcd ( nrqcd ) and heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) .",
    "this is done either _ a priori _ , by discretizing the nrqcd action  @xcite , or _ a posteriori _ , by using the effective theories to describe lattice gauge theory with wilson fermions  @xcite .",
    "these strategies are possible because the typical _ spatial _ momenta in heavy quark systems are much smaller than the heavy quark mass .",
    "heavy quarkonia have momenta @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath60.3 is the heavy - quark velocity ; heavy - light hadrons have momenta only of order  @xmath7 . in these approaches one",
    "is left with discretization effects of order @xmath8 from the light quarks and gluons and of order @xmath9 from the heavy quark .",
    "the method of ref .",
    "@xcite smoothly connects to the usual continuum limit , so one can , in principle , reduce discretization effects to scale as a power of the lattice spacing  @xmath10 , but only by making  @xmath10 too small to be practical .",
    "klassen proposed using anisotropic lattices with the anisotropy @xmath11 chosen so that @xmath12 and @xmath13 are both small  @xcite .",
    "clearly , this proposal works only if @xmath14 is smaller than @xmath15 , as in the approaches based explicitly on heavy - quark theory .",
    "it also works only if renormalization constants have a smooth limit as @xmath16 , where @xmath1 is the bare quark mass .",
    "in particular , one would like to be able to expand the renormalization constants in powers of @xmath17 even when @xmath18 .",
    "then it may be possible to adjust the improvement parameters of the lattice action ( and currents ) in a non - perturbative , mass - independent scheme  @xcite .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath19 dependence appears in an essential way , then one would be forced back to a non - relativistic interpretation , as explained for isotropic lattices in refs .",
    "@xcite .    to our knowledge",
    "there is no proof that cutoff effects always appear as powers of  @xmath20 . in this paper",
    "we try to gain some experience by calculating the full mass dependence of several ( re)normalization constants , first at tree level and then at one - loop in perturbation theory .",
    "we focus on the fermilab action  @xcite , which is the most general action without doubler states , having different nearest - neighbor and clover couplings in the temporal and spatial directions .",
    "this action has been applied on anisotropic lattices to the charmonium system  @xcite , as have some actions with next - to - nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "the self - energy has been calculated at the one - loop level in perturbation theory  @xcite .    in the numerical work on charmonium ,",

    "( in a perturbative calculation more generally improved actions with @xmath23 also have been considered  @xcite . ) by studying the full functional dependence on @xmath24 and @xmath17 , we can test whether @xmath25 appears in an essential way .",

    "for the other choice , @xmath22 , the continuum limit is reached only for @xmath26 .",
    "it turns out that with the first choice ( @xmath21 ) two of the improvement parameters vanish at the tree - level as @xmath16 .",
    "this simplifies the one - loop analysis , so in the second part of the paper we concentrate on this choice .",
    "this calculation has two purposes .",
    "the first is to study cutoff effects of the renormalization coefficients and to test at the one - loop level whether they still appear only as powers of @xmath27 .",
    "the second is for phenomenological applications to heavy - light matrix elements .",
