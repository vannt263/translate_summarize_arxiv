    "<S> finite distributions @xmath66 can be obtained by relaxing the assumption i ) and/or the assumption vi ) ; a stronger @xmath58 dependence could be obtained by a more transparent prescription for restoring momentum conservation ( approximation v ) . </S>",
    "<S> the present analysis has been motivated in part by the necessity of calculating cross - sections for the process studied in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which could give access to @xmath0 . in that case , the main contribution comes from the erbl region </S>",
    "<S> . it will be therefore very interesting to extend the study to antiquark degrees of freedom , relaxing the approximation ii ) . </S>",
    "<S> besides , to predict realistic cross sections , one has to evolve these low - factorization scale results to experimental scales , according to pqcd . </S>",

    "<S> the analysis is motivated in part by the necessity of estimating cross sections for a physical processes which has been proposed to access generalized transversity . </S>",
    "<S> as it has been done in the past to obtain first estimates of different parton distributions , the mit bag model has been chosen , adopting su(6 ) symmetry . as expected , in su(6 ) only the generalized transversity distribution is non vanishing ; the forward limit is recovered and the main features of the full result , at the low factorization scale of the model , are a weak @xmath58 dependence and a little contribution in the erbl region . </S>",
    "<S> the output of the calculation underestimates lattice data and fulfills recently proposed positivity bounds . </S>",
    "<S> this work represents a first step for a full modelling of parton helicity flip gpds in the quark sector , relevant for phenomenological studies . </S>",
    "<S> more realistic estimates will be obtained by relaxing the su(6 ) assumption , taking into account antiquark degrees of freedom , implementing a better prescription for restoring translational invariance , evolving the model results to experimental scales . </S>",
