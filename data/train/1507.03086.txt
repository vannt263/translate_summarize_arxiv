    "a wide set of cosmological observations suggest that the dynamics of the universe are currently dominated by some form of `` dark energy '' , which in standard friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) models is propelling an acceleration in late - time cosmic expansion ( e.g.   _ planck _ collaboration 2015a , aubourg et al .  2015 , betoule et al .  2014 ) .",
    "the physical nature of dark energy is not yet understood , and a widely - considered possibility is that the nature of gravitation differs on large cosmological scales from the predictions of general relativity ( gr ) in an frw metric . as a result ,",
    "a key task for current cosmological surveys is to construct observations to test for such departures .",
    "gravitational physics produces a rich variety of observable signatures that can be used for this purpose .",
    "the most precisely - measured signal results from the `` peculiar motions '' of galaxies as they fall toward overdense regions as non - relativistic test particles in a perturbed frw metric .",
    "these motions produce correlated doppler shifts in galaxy redshifts that manifest themselves as an overall anisotropy in the measured clustering signal as a function of the angle to the line - of - sight ( kaiser 1987 ) , known as redshift - space distortion ( rsd ) .",
    "the amplitude of this anisotropy has been accurately measured in a number of galaxy surveys across a range of redshifts and allows the growth rate @xmath7 of cosmic structure , which describes the gravitational amplification of density perturbations , to be inferred .",
    "to date , these measurements are broadly consistent with the prediction of the standard cosmological model ( e.g.  blake et al .",
    "2011 , beutler et al .",
    "2012 , reid et al .  2012 , de la torre et al .",
    "2013 , samushia et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "a highly complementary route for probing gravitational effects is to study the deflections of relativistic test particles such as photons , which are additionally sensitive to the curvature of space produced by density perturbations .",
    "these deflections , known as gravitational lensing , may be measured in a statistical sense using the correlations imprinted in the apparent shapes of background galaxies behind foreground lenses in deep imaging surveys .",
    "the level of the signal is determined by both the amplitude of the density fluctuations around the lenses ( again reflecting the growth of structure with redshift ) and the relative distances of the source - lens systems , both of which may be predicted by a given cosmological model ( for a review , see bartelmann & schneider 2001 ) .",
    "recent projects such as the canada - france - hawaii telescope lensing survey ( cfhtlens ) have allowed a suite of such tests to be carried out ( e.g.  heymans et al .",
    "2013 , simpson et al .",
    "2013 ) by providing deep , wide , high - resolution imaging .",
    "zhang et al .  (",
    "2007 ) proposed that a powerful gravitational consistency check might be performed by using the same set of galaxies to trace non - relativistic gravitationally - driven motion using redshift - space distortion , and to serve as foreground lenses for probing the relativistic deflection of light from background sources . in this way",
    ", it could be ascertained whether the relative amplitude of these two effects , driven by the same underlying density perturbations traced by the lenses , was consistent with the prediction of gr assuming a perturbed frw metric for a given set of cosmological parameters including the matter density @xmath8 .",
    "this can be achieved by measuring a quantity known as the `` gravitational slip '' @xmath9 as a function of physical scale @xmath10 , which is constructed from the galaxy - galaxy lensing signal and the redshift - space distortion and clustering amplitude of the lenses .",
    "standard perturbed gr cosmology predicts that a scale - independent value @xmath11 should be recovered .",
    "failure of this cross - check would indicate either the breakdown of linear perturbation theory , an inconsistency in the assumed cosmological parameters such as the matter density or curvature , or that a large - scale modification in gravitational physics was required .",
    "a requirement for carrying out this programme is the availability of galaxy spectroscopic redshift surveys and deep gravitational lensing imaging surveys which overlap on the sky .",
    "reyes et al .",
    "( 2010 ) performed this test using data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) covering @xmath12 deg@xmath13 , using a sample of @xmath14 luminous red galaxy lenses at @xmath2 and shape measurements with a surface density @xmath15 arcmin@xmath16 and produced a gravitational slip measurement consistent with gr in a @xmath17-dominated universe .",
    "the goal of our current study is to use new , significantly deeper , spectroscopic and imaging survey datasets to extend these tests to higher source densities and more distant redshifts @xmath18 .",
    "in particular we use imaging data from cfhtlens ( heymans et al .",
    "2012 ) and the 2nd red cluster sequence lensing survey ( gilbank et al .  2011 , hildebrandt et al .",
    "2015 ) , and overlapping spectroscopic data from the wigglez dark energy survey ( drinkwater et al .",
    "2010 ) and baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss , eisenstein et al .",
    "2011 ) to carry out this investigation .",
    "we note that a measurement of @xmath0 using lensing of the cosmic microwave background was recently presented by pullen et al .",
    "( 2015 ) .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows : in section [ sectheory ] we introduce the theory underpinning galaxy - galaxy lensing and rsd in a perturbed frw metric , the methodology for suppressing small - scale information which is difficult to model , and our test statistic for gravitational physics , @xmath0 . in section [ secdata ]",
    "we summarize our input datasets , and in section [ secmeas ] we present the galaxy - galaxy lensing measurements expressed as both the average tangential shear as a function of angular separation @xmath19 and the differential surface density as a function of projected physical separation @xmath20 , together with a series of tests for shape - measurement systematics .",
    "we pay particular attention to how the full redshift probability distribution of each source , determined from photometric - redshift estimation , can be included in an unbiased estimator of @xmath20 from source - lens pairs . in section [ secsim ]",
    "we describe a large set of new n - body simulations , including self - consistent gravitational lensing , that we use for determining errors in our measurements and testing models .",
    "finally in section [ seccosmo ] we present the first cosmological implications , including new measurements of @xmath0 up to redshift @xmath18 .",
    "we conclude in section [ secconc ] .",
    "this paper is the first in a series which will dissect the cosmological information in overlapping deep galaxy lensing and spectroscopic datasets .",
    "future studies will present full cosmological fits including cosmic microwave background data in a range of modified gravity scenarios , and the use of photometric - redshift and spectroscopic - redshift cross - correlations to determine simultaneously the source redshift distributions and cosmological parameters .",
    "galaxy - galaxy lensing describes the shear - density correlation imprinted between the shapes of background source galaxies and the foreground large - scale structure traced by the lens galaxies ; it is measured by computing the azimuthally - averaged tangential shear of the sources as a function of their angular distance @xmath21 from the lenses : @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the tangential shear component of the source with respect to the separation vector @xmath24 connecting it to the lens , and @xmath25 is the overdensity of the lens galaxies at position @xmath26 .",
    "fourier transforming the variables in equation [ eqgtdef ] we find that ( e.g.  hu & jain 2004 ) @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the 2nd - order bessel function of the first kind , and the galaxy - convergence cross - power spectrum @xmath29 is given by ( e.g.  bartelmann & schneider 2001 , guzik & seljak 2001 , joachimi & bridle 2010 ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 . \\label{eqws}\\ ] ] in these equations , @xmath32 is the co - moving radial coordinate at redshift @xmath33 assuming a spatially - flat universe , @xmath34 is the galaxy - mass cross - power spectrum at wavenumber @xmath35 , @xmath36 $ ] are the redshift probability distributions of the source and lens samples , normalized such that @xmath37 , and @xmath38 and @xmath39 are hubble s constant and the speed of light , respectively .",
    "these relations make the approximations of using the limber equation and neglecting additional effects such as cosmic magnification and intrinsic alignments .",
    "these equations make clear that the tangential shear is sensitive to the cosmological model through the distance - redshift relation describing the relative geometry of the source - lens - observer systems , and through the clustering of the matter overdensities traced by the lenses .",
    "our method of estimating @xmath40 from the data is described in section [ secgtest ] .      in this study",
    "we are interested in `` de - projecting '' the angular tangential shear profile in order to recover the statistics of the projected mass surface density @xmath41 around the lenses as a function of projected spatial separation @xmath10 .",
    "assuming an axisymmetric lens , and a single lens - source pair with respective redshifts @xmath42 , the average tangential shear at projected separation @xmath10 from the lens is given by @xmath43 ( e.g.  bartelmann & schneider 2001 ) , where @xmath44 and the differential projected surface mass density @xmath45 is defined in terms of @xmath46 by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the average mass density within a circle of radius @xmath10 , @xmath49 in equation [ eqgtdelsig1 ] the co - moving critical surface mass density @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 \\ , \\chi(z ) \\ , ( 1 + z ) } \\right\\ } , \\label{eqsigc}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the gravitational constant and @xmath53 .",
    "the differential projected surface density around the lenses is related to the lens galaxy - matter cross - correlation function @xmath54 by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the mean cosmological matter density , related to the critical density @xmath57 mpc@xmath58 [ with @xmath59 km s@xmath60 mpc@xmath60 ) ] by @xmath61 , and @xmath62 denotes the co - moving line - of - sight separation .    by substituting equations [ eqpgk ] and [ eqws ] into equation [ eqgtmod ] , and comparing with the result of substituting equations [ eqsigc ] and [ eqxigm ] into equation [ eqgtdelsig1 ] , we can determine after some algebra how equation [ eqgtdelsig1 ] generalizes for broad source and lens distributions .",
    "the result is @xmath63 noting that for narrow lens and source redshift distributions , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , equation [ eqgtdelsig2 ] reduces to equation [ eqgtdelsig1 ] .",
    "equation [ eqgtdelsig2 ] clarifies that for a broad lens redshift distribution it is not possible to solve for @xmath66 in closed form .",
    "however , for a narrow lens redshift distribution , averaging over a background source redshift distribution @xmath67 , we can recover the relation @xmath68^{-1 } .",
    "\\label{eqgtdelsig3}\\ ] ] section [ secdelsigest ] presents an analysis to justify that this approximation is acceptable , given the source and lens redshift distributions of our datasets .",
    "our method of estimating @xmath69 from the data is described in section [ secdelsigest ] .",
    "the cross - power spectrum of lens galaxies and underlying mass that appears in equation [ eqpgk ] , @xmath70 , and the equivalent cross - correlation function in equation [ eqxigm ] , @xmath71 , depend on the manner or `` bias '' with which the lens galaxies trace the matter field .",
    "although this bias is in general a stochastic , non - linear and scale - dependent function , it may be approximated on sufficiently - large scales as a linear mapping between the galaxy and matter overdensity , @xmath72 ( e.g. , scherrer & weinberg 1998 ) . in this case",
    "@xmath73 , in terms of the matter auto - correlation function @xmath74 which may be modelled from the cosmological parameters , where the unknown bias parameter @xmath75 may be determined using the auto - correlation function of the lenses , @xmath76 .",
    "since 3d measurements of galaxy clustering are performed in redshift - space , the apparent radial positions of the galaxies contain an additional correlated imprint from galaxy peculiar velocities , known as redshift - space distortion ( rsd ) . in particular , the fourier transform of the redshift - space galaxy overdensity field , @xmath77 , is given under certain assumptions ( e.g.  percival & white 2009 , blake et al .",
    "2011 ) by @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the fourier transform of the divergence of the peculiar velocity field in units of the co - moving hubble velocity and @xmath80 is the cosine of the angle of the fourier mode to the line - of - sight .    assuming that the velocity field is generated under linear perturbation theory then @xmath81 , where @xmath7 is the growth rate of structure , expressible in terms of the growth factor @xmath82 at cosmic scale factor @xmath83 as @xmath84 .",
    "the growth factor is defined in terms of the amplitude of a single perturbation as @xmath85 . under the assumption of linear galaxy bias",
    "we then obtain the standard expression for the redshift - space galaxy power spectrum in linear theory ( kaiser 1987 ) @xmath86 where we have introduced the redshift - space distortion parameter @xmath87 , which governs the amplitude of the measured rsd .",
    "the anisotropic imprint of rsd in galaxy clustering allows the measurement of the gravitational growth rate and , consequently , powerful tests of gravitational physics .",
    "however , it also introduces an extra amplitude factor in the relation between @xmath88 and @xmath89 , complicating inferences about the galaxy bias . in order to avoid this issue the real - space",
    "`` projected '' correlation function @xmath90 , independent of rsd , can instead be constructed by integrating the 3d galaxy correlation function @xmath91 along the line - of - sight : @xmath92 our method of estimating @xmath90 from the data is described in section [ secwpest ] . in practice the limits of equation [ eqwpmod ] must be taken as large , finite values .",
    "equation [ eqdelsigdef ] demonstrates that the amplitude of @xmath69 depends on the surface density of matter around galaxies across a range of smaller scales from zero to @xmath10 .",
    "this is problematic from the viewpoint of fitting cosmological models to the data since at small scales , within the halo virial radius , the cross - correlation coefficient between the matter and galaxy fluctuations is a complex function which is difficult to predict from first principles ( baldauf et al .",
    "2010 , mandelbaum et al .",
    "2010 ) . in order to remove this sensitivity to small - scale information",
    "these authors proposed a new statistic , the annular differential surface density ( adsd ) , denoted by @xmath93 and defined by @xmath94 which does not contain information originating from scales @xmath95 .",
    "the small - scale limit @xmath96 is chosen to be large enough to reduce the main systematic effects discussed above , but small enough to preserve a high signal - to - noise ratio in the measurements ( also see the discussion in mandelbaum et al .  2013 ) .",
    "an alternative approach is to model the halo occupation statistics and marginalize over the free parameters ( e.g. , cacciato et al .",
    "2013 ) .",

    "however , the motion of non - relativistic particles arising from the gravitational attraction of matter , which produces galaxy clustering and rsd , is sensitive only to the derivatives of the newtonian potential @xmath104 ( e.g. , jain & zhang 2008 ) .    in standard general relativity ( gr ) , in the absence of anisotropic stress , @xmath105 and both potentials",
    "are related to the matter overdensity via the poisson equation @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , by measuring if both the gravitational lensing of photons and galaxy peculiar velocity respond in an identical manner to the matter overdensity traced by the lens galaxies in our datasets , we can perform a fundamental test of whether the relation between @xmath107 and @xmath100 follows the gr expectation ( assuming this perturbation approximation applies ) .",
    "zhang et al .  ( 2007 ) proposed that this test can be efficiently carried out by cross - correlating lens galaxies to both the surrounding velocity field using rsd and to the shear of background galaxies using galaxy - galaxy lensing .",

    "the results of these tests are shown in figure [ figsysshear ] ; in all cases we should find @xmath127 in the absence of systematic errors .",
    "the covariance matrices for each measurement are obtained by applying the same systematics - test operation to each mock catalogue ; this covariance allows us to evaluate the @xmath128 statistic of the @xmath129 model in each case .",
    "these values are printed in each panel along with the number of degrees of freedom , @xmath130 , and indicate consistency with the model .",
    "the effect of the additive shear calibration bias is negligible for galaxy - galaxy lensing .",
    "figure [ figcorrmult ] displays the multiplicative shear bias corrections @xmath131 and @xmath132 , defined by equations [ eqktheta ] and [ eqkr ] , which are applied to the galaxy - galaxy lensing measurements by multiplying the estimated values by @xmath133 .",
    "corrections are shown for each combination of source - lens datasets , combining the different survey fields .",
    "these corrections are approximately independent of scale and have values @xmath134 .",
    "we note that the determinations of @xmath132 depend on the redshift distribution of the source and lens samples , through the weighting factor @xmath135 , which imprints an extra variation between datasets compared to @xmath131 .",
    "systematic errors in the bpz photometric redshift probability distributions would imprint errors in the determination of @xmath69 , which relies on the computation of @xmath137 for each source - lens pair from an integral over redshift weighted by @xmath138 , and in the cosmological modelling , which uses the source redshift probability distribution @xmath67 derived from stacking the individual @xmath138 functions .",
    "we tested for such systematics by computing the amplitude of the tangential shear around a fixed set of foreground lenses in a series of eight photometric redshift bins defined using @xmath136 ",

    "lens_fit weights , in each of the photo-@xmath33 slices .",
    "a signal is produced even for low values of @xmath136 , because sources are scattered to apparent low redshifts from true higher redshifts .",
    "figure [ figsisphotz ] displays the fits for the @xmath140 parameter of the four different lens samples  wgzloz , wgzhiz , lowz and cmass  in each photo-@xmath33 bin , using these @xmath145 functions determined from the outputs of bpz .",
    "the fits are performed to @xmath19 measurements in the range @xmath146 .",
    "the inferred values of @xmath140 are generally consistent as the source photo-@xmath33 slice changes , with the possible exception of the lowest redshift slice @xmath147 for cfhtlens , which contains a negligible number of galaxies .",
    "another potential systematic effect that could impact our measurements is the intrinsic alignment of the background source sample with the foreground lens distribution .",
    "this effect is expected to preferentially diminish the average tangential shear of red source galaxies compared to blue galaxies .",
    "the bpz pipeline returns a source galaxy type in the range @xmath149 , and we used this parameter to divide the sources into sub - samples of red ( @xmath150 ) and blue ( @xmath151 ) galaxies . following section [ secsysphotz ] , we then determined the velocity dispersion of foreground lenses in the sis model for the blue , red and combined source samples in the range @xmath152 .",

    "the source distributions @xmath67 for each case were determined by stacking the appropriate subset of bpz redshift distributions .",
    "results are displayed in figure [ figsistb ] .",
    "the inferred values of @xmath140 are again generally consistent amongst the samples , with the possible exception of the cross - correlations between cfhtlens and boss red galaxies . however , as shown in figure [ figegzphot ] , the fitted value of @xmath0 is not significantly affected by cutting the sources to a blue sample .",
    "some sources may be clustered or associated with the lenses , but scattered to higher redshifts by photo-@xmath33 errors .",
    "these sources will not be lensed , diluting the cross - correlation signal .",
    "the strength of this effect may be determined by measuring the excess in the number counts of source galaxies in the vicinity of lens galaxies , compared to a random distribution of lenses .",
    "the resulting multiplicative bias in the measurement of @xmath20 may be corrected by boosting the signal by @xmath156 where @xmath157 denotes the weights of the random lenses ( normalized such that @xmath158 ) , and where @xmath159 should be replaced by @xmath160 when moving from the estimator of equation [ eqdelsigest2 ] to [ eqdelsigest1 ] .",

    "the signal is generally consistent with @xmath161 , with deviations at the level of @xmath162 or below for scales @xmath163 mpc .",
    "we do not apply this correction to our measurements .",
    "we note that an effect @xmath164 , which is not expected through physical association , may be obtained if there is an anti - correlation between sources and lenses ( for example , star - forming galaxies avoid dense environments on small scales ) , or through instrumental effects impacting the imaging data ( such as contamination from light of foreground galaxies or sky subtraction ) ."
