    "these lectures are trying to get you interested in @xmath0-polytopes .",
    "but i must warn you : they are mostly `` bad news lectures ''  with two types of bad news :    1 .",
    "general @xmath0-polytopes are complicated objects , and some of them have various kinds of extremely bad properties such as `` huge coefficients '' and `` many facets , '' which are bad news also with respect to applications .",
    "2 .   even worse , there are bad gaps in our understanding of @xmath0-polytopes .",
    "very basic problems and questions are open , some of them embarassingly easy to state , but hard to answer .",
    "so , @xmath0-polytopes are interesting and remain _",
    "challenging_.    a good grasp on the structure of @xmath0-polytopes is important for the `` polyhedral combinatorics '' approach of combinatorial optimization .",
    "this has motivated an extremely thorough study of some special classes of @xmath0-polytopes such as the traveling salesman polytopes ( see grtschel & padberg @xcite and applegate , bixby , cook & chvtal @xcite ) and the cut polytopes ( see deza & laurent @xcite , and section  [ sec : cut ] ) . in such studies the question about properties of general @xmath0-polytopes , and for complexity estimates about them , arises quite frequently and naturally .",
    "thus grtschel & padberg @xcite looked for upper bounds on the number of facets , and we can now considerably improve the estimates they had then ( section  [ sec : facets ] ) .",
    "one also asks for the sizes of the integers that appear as facet coefficients  and the fact that these coefficients may be huge ( section  [ sec : coeff ] ) is bad news since it means that there is a great danger of numerical instability or arithmetic overflow .    surprisingly , however , properties of _ general @xmath0-polytopes _ have not yet been a focus of research .",
    "i think they should be , and these lecture notes ( expanded from my dmv - seminar lectures in oberwolfach , november 1997 ) are meant to provide support for this .    of course , the distinction between `` special '' and `` general '' @xmath0-polytopes is somewhat artificial .",
    "for example , billera & sarangarajan @xcite have proved the surprising fact that _ every _ @xmath0-polytope appears as a face of a tsp - polytope .",
    "nevertheless , a study of the broad class of general @xmath0-polytopes provides new points of view . here",
    "it appears natural to look at _ extremal _ polytopes ( e.  g.  polytopes with `` many facets '' ) , and at _ random polytopes _ and their properties .",
    "where is the difficulty in this study ?",
    "the definition of @xmath0-polytopes is very simple , examples are easy to come by , and they can be analyzed completely .",
    "but this simplicity is misleading : there are various effects that appear only in rather high dimensions ( @xmath1 , whatever that means ) .",
    "part of this we will trace to one basic linear algebra concept : determinants of @xmath0-matrices , which show their typical behaviour  large values , and a low probability to vanish  only when the dimension gets quite large .",
    "thus one rule of thumb will be justified again and again :    low - dimensional intuition does not work !    despite this ( and to demonstrate this ) , our discussion in various lectures will take the low - dimensional situation as a starting point , and as a point of reference .",
    "( for example , the first lecture will start with a list of @xmath2-dimensional @xmath0-polytopes , which will turn out to be deceptively simple . )",
    "however , examples are nevertheless important . the polymake project @xcite provides a framework and many fundamental tools for their detailed analysis .",
    "thus , these lecture notes come with a library of interesting examples , provided as a separate section of the polymake database at    * http://www.math.tu-berlin.de/diskregeom/polymake/    we will refer to examples in this database throughout . the names of the polytope data files are of the form nn : d - n.poly , where nn is an identifyer of the polytope ( e.  g.  initials of whoever supplied the example ) , d is the dimension of the polytope , n is its number of vertices .",
    "i invite you to play with these examples .",
    "( also , i am happy to accept further contributions to extend this bestiary of interesting @xmath0-polytopes ! )",

    "the product @xmath39 of a row with a column vector yields the standard scalar product , while @xmath40 is a product of a column vector with a row vector ( of the same length ) , and thus represents a matrix of rank  @xmath35 .",

    "we have more of a chance to `` understand '' an example by feeding it to a computer and asking for an analysis .",
    "more specifically , we may present @xmath47 to the polymake system of gawrilow & joswig @xcite in terms of a file that contains the key word points in its first line , and then the matrix @xmath48 in the following lines  the rows of this matrix give homogeneous coordinates for the vertices of  @xmath47 .    for @xmath49",
    ", @xmath50 is the _ standard _ simplex of dimension @xmath51 . + this is a _ regular _ simplex , since all its edges have the same length  @xmath52 , but it is not full - dimensional , since it lies in the hyperplane given by @xmath53 .",
    "alternatively , we could consider the simplex @xmath54 which is full - dimensional , but not regular for @xmath55 .",

    "( prove this ! ) thus for the @xmath0-polytope @xmath61 we _ have _ a complete description in terms of linear equations and inequalities .",
    "from this we get @xmath47 as the image of the projection @xmath62 that deletes the last @xmath42 coordinates .",
    "equivalently , to get @xmath63 from @xmath64 we must apply the operation `` delete the last coordinate '' @xmath42 times .",
    "every @xmath0-polytope @xmath65 can be written as the set of solutions of a system of linear inequalities , that is , as @xmath66 for some @xmath67 , a matrix @xmath68 , and a vector @xmath69 .",
    "*    first , we need not deal with equations in the system that describes @xmath64 , since these can be rewritten in terms of inequalities : the equation @xmath70 is equivalent to the two inequalities @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "thus , with the observations above , it suffices to show that if a set @xmath73 has a description of the form @xmath74 then the projection of @xmath75 to @xmath76 ( by `` deleting the last coordinate '' ) has a representation of the same type .",
    "we may assume that the inequality system has been ordered so that @xmath77 now for any given @xmath78 , it is easy to decide whether it lies in @xmath79 .",
    "namely , @xmath80 holds if and only if there is some value @xmath81 such that @xmath82 , where the inequalities for @xmath83 provide upper bounds for such a value  @xmath84 , the inequalities for @xmath85 give lower bounds , the others provide no conditions .",
    "thus the system has a solution @xmath84 for given @xmath86 if all the upper bounds are at least as large as all the lower bounds .",

    "however , the bad news is that even a minimal system  which in the case of a full - dimensional polytope @xmath6 consists of exactly one inequality for each facet of  @xmath6  may be huge .",
