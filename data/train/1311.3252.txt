    "far - infrared spectroscopy and transport measurements were from early on used to investigate the electronic structure@xcite of quantum dots of various types .",
    "far - infrared spectroscopy of arrays of quantum dots@xcite turned out to be rather insensitive to the exact form of the interaction between the electrons .",
    "the reason being that most arrays of quantum dots resulted in almost parabolic confinement of electrons to individual dots in the low energy regime .",
    "soon it was realized that an exact symmetry condition , known as the the extended kohn s theorem@xcite is valid for such systems as long as each dot is much smaller than the wavelength of the dipole radiation , and results in a pure center - of - mass motion of the electrons in each dot , independent of the number of electrons and the nature of the interaction between them .",
    "signatures of deviations from the parabolic confinement where soon discovered in experimental results and interpreted with model calculations based on various approaches to linear response.@xcite the coulomb blockade helped guaranteeing a definite number of electrons in each quantum dot homogeneously in the large arrays that were necessary to allow measurement of the weak fir absorption signal . deviations from the parabolic confinement of electrons in quantum dots lead to the excitation of internal collective modes that can cause splitting of the upper plasmonic branch and make visible the classical bernstein@xcite modes.@xcite in the lower plasmonic branch they lead to weak oscillations caused by filling factor dependent screening properties.@xcite    resonant raman scattering has been applied to quantum dots to analyze `` single - electron '' excitations and collective modes with monopole , dipole , or quadrupole symmetry ( @xmath0).@xcite as the monopole collective oscillations are excitations that can be exclusively described by internal relative coordinates one would expect them to be more influenced by the coulomb interaction between the electrons than the dipole excitations that have to be described by relative and center - of - mass coordinates , or purely by the latter ones when the kohn theorem holds.@xcite the @xmath1 collective mode among others was measured by a very different method and calculated for a confined two - dimensional electron system in the classical regime on the surface of liquid helium.@xcite    in the far - infrared and the raman measurements of arrays of dots the excitation has always been weak and some version of linear response has been an adequate approach to interpret the experimental results .",
    "all the same , curiosity has driven theoretical groups into questioning how the electron system in a quantum dot would respond as the linear regime is surpassed and a strong excitation would pump energy into the system.@xcite these studies have been undertaken with some kind of a mean - field model to incorporate the coulomb interaction between the electrons .",
    "here , we will explore this nonlinear excitation regime with a model built on exact numerical diagonalization or configuration interaction ( ci)@xcite and compare the results with the predictions of three different mean - field approaches , and a time - dependent hubbard model . besides the question of what happens in the nonlinear regime ,",
    "we want to see how close to the exact results the mean - field models can come for only two electrons in the dot , a regime that is indeed challenging for mean - field approaches which in general are more appropriate for a higher number of electrons .",
    "we will address issues of nonlinear behavior .",
    "what do we classify as nonlinear behavior ?",
    "can we see it emerging in an exact model ?",
    "how , and when is it inherent in a mean - field approach ?",
    "in order to describe the response to an excitation of arbitrary strength we will follow the time - evolution of the system by methods that are appropriate to each model . at @xmath2",
    "the quantum dot is radiated by a short thz pulse @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the heaviside step function .",
    "for the purpose of making the response strongly dependent on the coulomb interaction between the electrons we select the monopole or the breathing mode with @xmath5 .",
    "it should be kept in mind that this short excitation pulse perturbs the system in a wide frequency range .",
    "the quantum dot will have a parabolic confinement potential @xmath6 with @xmath7 mev .",
    "in addition , we will sometimes add a small potential hill in the center of the dot @xmath8 with @xmath9 mev , and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the characteristic length scale for the parabolic confinement .",
    "we will be assuming gaas parameters here with @xmath12 and a dielectric constant @xmath13 .",
    "if we select @xmath14 , @xmath15 mev , @xmath16 mev , and @xmath17 ps@xmath18 , then the initial pulse of duration approximately @xmath19 ps represents a spatial circular gaussian pulse rising from zero and vanishing after its amplitude gets negative .",
    "the system is perturbed by a radial compression followed by a slight radial expansion and then left to oscillate freely about the equilibrium point .",
    "the system will be kicked out of equilibrium and the time - evolution has to be described accordingly for each model .",
    "the reason for adding the central hill ( [ vc ] ) to the quantum dot is to avoid any special symmetry that could result from the parabolic confinement ( [ vpar ] ) .",
    "the details of a density functional theoretical ( dft ) approach to the model used to describe nonadiabatic excitation of electrons in a quantum ring or dots in an external magnetic field has been published earlier.@xcite here , we will use the model for a vanishing external magnetic field and properly make clear the difference in the calculation of the time - evolution of this mean - field model to the ci model . to accomplish this",

    "it is also clear that the presence of the central hill ( fig .",
    "[ fft - maxmin](b ) ) shifts the frequency of the main peaks and allows for the excitation of many more .",
    "the central hill does break some special symmetry imposed by the parabolic confinement , that the coulomb interaction alone does not break .",
    "above , we have introduced mean - field theoretical models and a many - electron model that is solved exactly in a truncated fock - space for two electrons to describe the strong radial excitation of electrons in a quantum dot .",
    "these models do all appear in different studies of linear response of quantum dots .",
    "the mean - field models tend , due to their nature , though to be used for dots with a higher number of electrons .",
    "the nonlinear sp - model can though be considered as an attempt to create a version of a mean - field approach fit for two electrons . for curiosity",
    "we like to add the last model , the hubbard model , a many - electron model that has not often been applied to describe the electrons in a single parabolically confined quantum dot .",
    "the hamiltonian for the electrons in a quantum dot described by the hubbard model is @xmath118 where the coulomb interaction between the electrons is described by a spin dependent contact interaction @xmath119 and the hopping part has the form @xmath120 where @xmath121 denotes a summation over the neighboring sites .",
    "the model is written in terms of the creation @xmath122 , the destruction @xmath123 , and the number operator @xmath124 for electrons with spin @xmath125 on site @xmath114 . the potential part @xmath126 includes the parabolic potential ( [ vpar ] ) and possibly the central small hill ( [ vc ] ) .",
    "we set the hubbard model on a small square lattice with totally @xmath127 sites .",
    "we use the numbering of the states in the fock - space suggested by siro and harju.@xcite the height and the width of the lattice is fixed in terms of the characteristic length scale for the parabolic confinement to be @xmath128 .",
    "the lattice length is then @xmath129 and the hopping constant is @xmath130 .",
    "the value for the strength of the coulomb interaction is not so straightforward to find , but we fix the value of @xmath131 such that the energy of the ground state of the system is in accordance with the value found in the exact model .",
    "we keep in mind that there will always be a difference in the many - body energy spectrum of these two models , due to the different treatment of the coulomb interaction and the finite square lattice that is bound to break the angular symmetry of the original model , but we want to see if we can identify some many - electron character in the excitation response .    the parabolic confinement of the electrons spreads out the energy spectrum of the hubbard model that otherwise is extremely dense , and thus we can use the same approach as for the exact many - body model to solve it exactly within a truncated fock - space .",

    "the main peak ( the lowest excitation ) is indeed split for the hubbard model in figures [ fft - hubbard ] and [ fft - hubbard - hill ] , and the modes at higher energy , only appear for a stronger excitation , i.e.  a higher value of @xmath36 . by looking at the lower panels in figures [ fft - hubbard ] and [ fft - hubbard - hill ] we see again that in the system without a central hill ( fig .",
    "[ fft - hubbard ] ) more modes get active as the excitation grows .",
    "this is in accordance with our observation for the ci model .",
    "we have to admit that on this small lattice chosen the energy of the lowest mode is a bit higher than all the other models predict , even though we have chosen the interaction strength @xmath131 to give the similar energy for the ground state as the ci model does .",
    "we do not use the hubbard model for higher excitation than @xmath134 mev to avoid artifacts created by the finite size of the model .",
    "for the quantum dot with no central hill present ( @xmath95 ) at weak excitation , @xmath135 , all the models deliver one main peak that grows linearly with the excitation strength . as we have seen the hubbard model due to the square symmetry imposed by the underlying lattice",
    "has two peaks,@xcite and in the case of the ci model we see a small side peak on the `` blue '' side , reminiscent of known results for the @xmath133 modes.@xcite    the location of the main peak in the case of the sp model is redshifted by an amount slightly surpassing 0.5 mev .",
    "this must be accredited to the slightly weaker repulsion of the electrons having a logarithmic singularity in the case of the sp model instead of the 3d coulomb repulsion in the other mean - field approximations , and in the ci model . with the small central hill in the quantum dot the location of the main peak in the dft model",
    "is blue shifted by 0.2 mev compared to the ci model , and the same analysis gives a blueshift of 0.3 mev for the ha . calculations of the ground state for the ci , the sp , and the dft model all give similar energy , but the ha gives results far off.@xcite    in the ci , the sp , and the hubbard models the inclusion of a small central potential hill in the confinement potential of the quantum dot causes more collective modes to be activated with increasing excitation @xmath36 . at the same time the lower panels of figures [ fft - exact - occ ] , [ fft - exact - hill - occ ] , [ fft - hubbard ] , and [ fft - hubbard - hill ] displaying occupation of interacting two - electron states indicates a slight simplification effects caused by the central hill , at least for some range of @xmath36 .",
    "amazingly , in the ha only one peak for the collective oscillations is seen for the whole range of excitation strength we try .",
    "this is probably caused by the artificial self - interaction that is specially large for two electrons described with the ha . on the other hand the dependence of the height of the main peak on @xmath36 for the fourier transform of the expectation value @xmath34 for the ha is very close to the results for the main peak for the ci model .    the finite occupation of higher energy states together with the increase of the mean total energy seen in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ exact - e ] shows that we have left the linear response regime with increasing @xmath36 .",
    "this fact is further demonstrated by the nonlinear growth of the height of the fourier peak for the expectation value @xmath34 for all models with increasing @xmath36 beyond the linear regime for low @xmath36 .",
    "in addition , we notice that for low @xmath36 the electrons in the quantum dot oscillate with @xmath34 very close to the ground state value . as the excitation is increased energy is pumped into the quantum dot and it increases in size .",
    "we have identified nonlinear behavior in all the models when observing how the amplitude of the oscillations of @xmath34 behave as a function of the excitation strength @xmath36 once we leave the linear response regime valid for very low excitation .",
    "the ci model is a purely linear model .",
    "all the possible excited states for the ci model are calculated before the time - integration of the system is started .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fft - maxmin ] where the excitations are compared for weak and strong excitation .",
    "the main peak at low @xmath36 is still visible in the excitation spectrum for large @xmath36 , at exactly the same energy .",
    "stronger excitation activates higher lying collective modes , and even in this simple system there very are many of them available .",
    "the time - evolution for the mean - field models has to be viewed in different terms . in case of the dft or the hartree model information about the two - electron excitation spectrum",
    "does not exist before the time - integration is started .",
    "the effective potential changes in each time - step and the occupation of effective single - electron states becomes time - dependent , see fig .",
    "[ occupation - t ] .",
    "the effective potential ( or equivalently , the density , or the density operator here ) has to be found by iterations in each time - step in order to include the effects of the coulomb interaction . within each iteration",
    "the problem is treated as a linear one . in case of the sp model the nonlinear solution for the groundstate",
    "is sought directly without an iteration , and the same is true for the time - dependent solutions .",
    "the time - evolution of the sp model is thus nontrivial and could in principle bring forward phenomena that could be blocked by the linear solution requirement within each iteration step for the other mean - field models , especially in a long time series where small effects from this methodology gathered in each time - step might sum up .    within the range for @xmath36 considered here",
    "the ha brings results that look very stable , one peak with no frequency shift as @xmath36 increases , but with a slight nonlinear behavior for the amplitude of the oscillations of @xmath34 .",
    "the sp and the dft models bring similar results for @xmath136 mev with a local minimum for the amplitude of the oscillations of @xmath34 . for larger values of @xmath36",
    "the sp model brings a plethora of collective oscillations , and for the dft model it becomes too difficult to stabilize a solution for a longer time interval .",
    "it should be kept in mind that also the ci model , especially for the case of no central hill , shows an increased number of active modes , but only for much stronger excitation and in a more `` controlled '' way .",
    "the different characteristics or the nuance of the nonlinear properties of the mean - field models may be influencing their response here to a strong excitation in a fundamentally different way than in the linear ci model .",
    "it should be stated once more that extreme care has been taken in verifying and testing our numerical results by comparing different numerical methods , models , and variation of sizes and types of functional spaces and grids .",
    "the modeling of nonlinear response of confined quantum systems on the nanoscale is in its infancy , but may bring new insight into the systems as the measuring , processing , and growth techniques evolve opening up the field . for systems with many particles we most likely will have to rely on mean - field and dft models , and",
    "only for systems of few particles can we expect to be able to rely on ci models . in anticipation of this",
    "we have studied here how some of these models fare describing the nonlinear response of a two electron model .",
    "we have to expect the ci - model to deliver numerically exact results that we can compare the results of the other models to .",
    "the results of our implementation of a dft - model do not compare well when leaving the linear response regime .",
    "this is not totally unexpected as we have not used any time - dependent functionals .",
    "in addition , the numerical time - integration of the dft model is difficult to guarantee for strong excitation and long times .",
    "the hartree model is easier to use and the overall qualitative nonlinear response of it is in accordance with the ci model , except for fine structure of side peaks visible in the ci model .",
    "similar comparison has been seen in the linear response earlier @xcite .",
    "the results of the coarse lattice hubbard model deviate quantitatively from the ci - results , but the qualitative behavior is similar , side peaks and occupation of higher modes with increased excitation .",
    "regarding the emergence of nonlinear effects the comparison to the sp model is valuable . in a mean field , or a local approximation to a dft theory the results are usually obtained by iterations , and most often there is a condition that the underlying linear basis is orthogonal . in calculations of molecules",
    "this condition is sometimes relaxed , but most often it is used to guarantee a connection to higher order many - body methods .",
    "this is not done in the sp model . there",
    "the nonlinear solution is found directly and the resulting states are not orthogonal . looking at our results we see that this essential nonlinearity does strongly affect the solution of the sp model beyond some excitation strength .",
    "these effects , emergence of many new excitation modes , splitting of modes , is not seen in any of the other models .",
    "so , even if the mean - field and the dft models are nonlinear , then the iteration procedure in a linear functional space does protect them from this mode splitting and multiplication . as stated in the previous section",
    "the nonlinear behavior seen from the ci results is much more modest and probably only results from the `` shape '' of the many - body energy spectrum that can be reached with increasing excitation .",
