    "as was recently noted by blaylock , seiden , and nir@xcite due to final state interaction ( fsi ) a term proportional to @xmath1 may appear in the rate of wrong sign @xmath2 decays even in the absence of cp violation .",
    "moreover , in some extensions of standard model which have large values of both @xmath3 and significant cp violation , a similar term may arise .",
    "et al . _ have suggested that a value of @xmath3 larger than the present experimental limit can be accomodated if one of these previously neglected terms destructively interferes with the other time dependent terms which arise from mixing ( proportional to @xmath4 ) and from doubly cabibbo suppressed decays ( dcsd ) ( proportional to @xmath5 ) .",
    "they suggest that this may invalidate the use of existing limits from time dependent mixing studies at fixed target experiments @xcite , @xcite to constrain extensions of the standard model .",
    "below , we give expressions for the time dependence in the general case and then attempt to estimate the maximum size of the terms proportional to @xmath6 .",
    "we follow the notation of references @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "let the mass eigenstates be @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "then @xmath9 @xmath10 in the limit of no cp violation , @xmath11=@xmath12=@xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the mass difference and lifetime difference , respectively .",
    "let a denote the amplitude for @xmath16 , b the amplitude for @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath18 and @xmath19 . the decay rate is then given by @xmath20 up to terms of order @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "the decay rate for the charge conjugate reaction is given by the same expression replacing @xmath22 with @xmath23 , @xmath24 with @xmath25 , and @xmath26 by @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 in the past , it was assumed that the term proportional to @xmath29 changes sign when averaging over a sample with equal numbers of @xmath30 and @xmath31 mesons@xcite,@xcite .",
    "this assumption is not correct in general as was noted in reference@xcite .",
    "the previous experimental analyses@xcite , @xcite , @xcite considered the deterioration of the limit in the case when the term proportional to @xmath32 interfered destructively with the mixing and dcsd components . the standard model expectation for @xmath33",
    "is many orders of magnitude below the current experimental sensitivity so this interference scenario is very unlikely . in most new physics scenarios which would give @xmath34 , @xmath35",
    "is not enhanced whereas values of @xmath3 much larger than those expected from the standard model are possible .",
    "it is also possible to experimentally verify that @xmath33 can be neglected by measuring the @xmath2 meson lifetime in a cp eigenstate e.g. @xmath36 and comparing to the lifetime in @xmath37@xcite,@xcite .",
    "we now consider equations  ( [ mixeqn1 ] ) ,  ( [ mixeqn2 ] ) in the following situation .",
    "let @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the phase @xmath41 is due to cp violation in the mass matrix .",
    "a non - zero value of @xmath42 may arise if the amplitudes a and b have different fsi .",
    "alternatively , if there are complex contributions to one of the amplitudes ( e.g. a ) that are not present in the other ( e.g. b ) , this can lead to an overall phase in @xmath43 .",
    "we have assumed that there is no direct cp violation in the amplitudes ( and hence e.g. @xmath44)@xcite .",
    "in addition , we neglect the small phase in @xmath45 from the ckm matrix , which is approximately @xmath46 in the wolfenstein parameterization and which lies in the range @xmath47 .",
    "the decay rate for wrong sign @xmath30 decays to @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 the corresponding rate for the charge conjugate reaction is obtained by replacing @xmath41 the phase from cp violation with @xmath50 and by changing @xmath51 to @xmath52 @xmath53    in the experimental analyses , the time dependent rate integrated over both types of particles is used : @xmath54 this rate , which will be denoted by @xmath55 , is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "two scenarios are considered in what follows .",
    "first the case of no cp violation but significant final state interactions ( fsi ) and then the case of both large cp violation and significant final state interaction are examined .      in the first scenario , consider the case of large mixing with @xmath58 , the value in the standard model .",
    "assume that this does not lead to an enhancement of @xmath33 i.e. @xmath59 and allow for non - zero @xmath42 but no cp violation ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the above equation then reduces to @xmath61    in order to determine the size of the new term proportional to @xmath29 , the values of the phase difference @xmath42 are considered in various models .",
    "this will allow an estimate of the additional experimental systematic error that is incurred from ignoring fsi .",
    "this phase difference @xmath42 is zero in the limit of exact su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "the values of @xmath42 from various models are given in table  [ tbdelta ] .",
    "large values of the phase @xmath42 occur when su(3 ) breaking is largest .",
    "we use the experimental result from cleo  ii for @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) and assume that it is entirely due to dcsd .",
    "this is found numerically to give the most conservative upper limit on the size of the interference effect .",
    "in general , the amplitudes for the @xmath64 and @xmath62 can be written as : @xmath65\\ ] ] @xmath66\\ ] ] where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the quark decay contributions into @xmath69 and @xmath70 final states respectively .",
    "c is the w - exchange contribution and @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the fsi phases .",
    "@xmath73 , @xmath74 are the corresponding dcsd amplitudes after the ckm factor @xmath75 has been factored out .",
    "the phase shifts in a given isospin eigenstate for particles and antiparticles are identical by cpt invariance ( which we assume as stated explicitly ) .",
    "the phase @xmath42 vanishes if two conditions are satisfied : ( i ) @xmath76 and ( ii ) @xmath77 .",
    "the first condition follows from cpt invariance and the second is satisfied if @xmath78 symmetry holds .",
    "hence if @xmath78 is an approximate symmetry , the phase @xmath42 should be small .",
    "the models used have been tuned to reproduce the observed magnitude of @xmath78 breaking in @xmath2 decays . to obtain more information , we turn to the detailed model fits .      in the model of chau and cheng , @xmath79 @xmath80 and @xmath81 then @xmath82 @xmath83 this",
    "yields a phase difference between the two decay modes of @xmath84 .",
    "if the w - exchange contribution @xmath85 is omitted , the phase difference becomes @xmath86 .    in the model of buccella _",
    "_ , one has @xmath87 @xmath88 and @xmath89 then @xmath90 @xmath91 leading to a phase difference of @xmath92 .",
    "omitting the w - exchange term gives a slightly smaller value of @xmath93 .",
    "it should be noted that a @xmath94 relates to @xmath95 for the @xmath69 @xmath96 resonance in the @xmath97 channel by @xmath98 where @xmath99 , @xmath100 mev , @xmath101 mev and @xmath102 .",
    "the models discussed above predict @xmath103 which is compatible with the cleo  ii measurement .",
    "there are also other models for @xmath2 decays in which a value for the phase difference @xmath42 can be extracted@xcite .",
    "since it is difficult to assign errors to these predictions , we regard @xmath104 as a reasonable range for @xmath42 . in order to explore the range of @xmath42 in the models",
    ", we have calculated the value of @xmath42 omitting the w - exchange term .",

    "now consider the contribution of cp violation .",
    "let @xmath105 and @xmath106@xcite .",
    "we assume @xmath107 is small compared to 1 and retain only terms linear in @xmath107 ; this is justified in the sm and even more so when @xmath3 is enhanced and @xmath108 .",
    "we allow the phase @xmath41 to be arbitrary . with these definitions and @xmath109 , the expression for @xmath55",
    "now becomes : @xmath110    the quantity @xmath107 is assumed to be small as in ref@xcite , however , the cp violating phase @xmath41 can be large as is the case for certain extensions of the standard model .",
    "the quantity @xmath107 for @xmath2 mixing is given by@xcite @xmath111 in the standard model and is already small ( @xmath112)@xcite .    in new physics scenarios with @xmath59 , @xmath113 for non standard models with @xmath114 of order unity",
    ", @xmath115 may be large ( o(1 ) ) .",
    "by contrast , @xmath116 the crucial point is that @xmath107 is proportional to @xmath117 and is highly suppressed if @xmath115 is of order unity and @xmath3 is enhanced .",
    "it is important to note that while @xmath118 can be much larger than the standard model expectation @xmath107 will be even smaller than the value in the standard model for new physics scenarios in which @xmath3 is enhanced .",
    "the total wrong sign rate can then be reduced to @xmath119 with @xmath107 as given above and @xmath120 , the expression for @xmath55 becomes @xmath121 hence , the term due to cp violation is too small to be observable when @xmath3 and @xmath122 are enhanced .    as experimental sensitivity improves and become sensitive to mixing at the level @xmath123 , it is possible that better sensitivity to @xmath0 mixing can be achieved by fitting the time distribution of @xmath124 .",
    "this rate , which will henceforth be denoted @xmath125 , is given by @xmath126 in the limit that @xmath127 and @xmath41 is large , this reduces to @xmath128 or neglecting the small term proportional to @xmath129 , @xmath130\\ ] ] note that in this case , the long lived tail of dcsd does not contribute to the signal .",
    "in addition , as noted by wolfenstein@xcite , for small values of @xmath3 , the term proportional to @xmath29 will be larger than the term in @xmath55 which is proportional to @xmath131 .",
    "this feature is illustrated in figs .",
    "2  ( a ) ,  2  ( b ) .",
    "the formalism presented here must be modified for the case of multibody modes such as @xmath132 or @xmath133 . for these other modes ,",
    "an additional complication is that the value of the final state phase difference , @xmath42 , may be different from the value in the case of @xmath134 and is not guaranteed to be small .",
    "it should also be remembered that limits on @xmath0 mixing from studies of semileptonic decays do not have the complications from dcsd and other hadronic effects discussed here .    at the present level of sensitivity and with reasonable ( though model dependent )",
    "values for the phase difference @xmath42 , the @xmath135 term which arises from fsi does not dramatically change the observed event yield for experiments which study the time dependence of mixing and is not yet a significant systematic experimental limitation .",
    "we suggest that future experiments determine systematic errors on their limits by using an upper limit on the phase difference @xmath42 .",
    "the contribution from the corresponding term proportional to @xmath135 due to cp violation which arises in extensions of standard model is highly suppressed .",
    "this term is not observable at the present level of experimental sensitivity .",
    "however , as emphasized by liu@xcite and by wolfenstein@xcite , this term should not be neglected as experimental examination of the @xmath136 distribution may allow more sensitive searches for @xmath137 mixing in the future if the cp violating phase is large .",
