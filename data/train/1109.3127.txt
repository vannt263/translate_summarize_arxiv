    "meson distribution amplitude ( da ) , which describes the momentum fraction distribution of the parton in meson , is an important component for the qcd light - cone sum rule ( lcsr ) and the qcd factorization theory @xcite . in dealing with the exclusive processes , it is convenient to arrange the meson s da by its different twist structures .",
    "the leading - twist da shows the momentum distribution of the valence quarks in the meson , which usually provides major contribution to the qcd exclusive processes .",
    "the higher - twist das describe either the contributions from the higher fock states with additional gluons and / or quark - antiquark pairs or the contributions from the transverse motion of quarks ( antiquarks ) in the leading - twist components . usually , the contributions from the higher - twist das are power suppressed to that of the leading - twist in the large @xmath11-region",
    ". however , the twist-3 das may provide sizable contributions for certain cases , so it arouses people s more and more interests , c.f .",
    "refs.@xcite .",
    "kaon twist-3 das are important input parameters for the kaon electromagnetic form factor , the @xmath12 transition form factor and etc . ,",
    "whose properties have been investigated within the qcd sum rules and the @xmath13 factorization approach accordingly @xcite .",
    "more precise data are coming at lhc , it would be useful to study the higher - order and higher - power suppressed contributions so as to provide a deeper understanding of standard model parameters . for example , it has been pointed out that the @xmath1-breaking effect is about @xmath14 for @xmath15 transition form factors , so a careful study on @xmath16 meson distributions shall lead to a better estimation of these form factors .",
    "we have studied the qcd sum rules for the pionic twist-3 das in ref.@xcite , which are based on the framework of the qcd background field theory @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we shall improve our technology adopted there and then investigate the twist-3 das of @xmath16 meson by carefully dealing with its @xmath1-breaking effect .",
    "such an effect is responsible for the different behaviors between kaon and pion das .",
    "basic assumption of the qcd sum rules is the introducing of the nonvanishing vacuum condensates such as the quark condensate @xmath17 and the gluon condensate @xmath18 .",
    "different to the conventional svz sum rules @xcite , the background field approach provides a systematic description for these vacuum condensates from the viewpoint of field theory . and , it is convenient to derive useful relations among different non - perturbative matrix elements . under the background field approach",
    ", it assumes that the quark and gluon fields are composed of the background fields and the quantum fluctuations around them .",
    "nonperturbative effects can be described by the vacuum expectation values of these background fields , while the calculable perturbative effects are expressed by quantum fluctuations . then to take the background field theory as the theoretical foundation for the qcd sum rules",
    ", it not only has distinct physical picture , but also can greatly simplify the calculation due to its capability of adopting different gauge conditions for quantum fluctuations and background fields respectively .    because of the influence from background fields , the quark and gluon propagators shall include nonperturbative component inevitably .",
    "for the svz sum rules , one usually takes the following quark propagator formula @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 stands for even higher - dimensional terms and higher - order mass terms . note",
    "that the above quark propagators in configuration space are given as an expansion in quark mass , and the mass terms are kept only up to first order . for the light - quark propagators , it is enough .",
    "however , the omitted higher - order mass terms may lead to sizable contributions to the meson or baryon with heavy quark(s ) .",
    "even for the case of @xmath16 meson , the contributions from higher - order @xmath2-quark mass terms , either positive or negative , are sizable .",
    "hence to obtain a better understanding of @xmath1-breaking effect for @xmath16 meson , one needs to take the sizable mass terms into consideration in a more proper way .",
    "the remaining parts of the paper are organized as follows . in sec.ii , we present the calculation technology for deriving the sum rules for the moments of the kaon twist-3 das . and a model for the kaon twist-3 wave functions is also presented .",
    "numerical results are given in sec.iii , where the properties of kaon twist-3 das are discussed .",
    "sec.iv is reserved for a summary . in the appendix",
    ", we give useful formulas for simplifying the matrix elements @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "under the background field theory , the quark and gluon propagators satisfy the following equations @xcite : @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are gauge covariant derivatives in the fundamental and adjoint representations respectively .",
    "@xmath27 is the background gluon field , @xmath28 is the gluon field strength tensor and @xmath29 is the structure constant of @xmath30 group .",
    "fixing the gauge freedom of the background field by the fixed - pointed gauge @xcite , @xmath31 , we obtain    @xmath32 \\gamma^\\mu b_{1\\nu\\mu|\\rho } + \\cdots \\right\\ } \\label{prop of s3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for the quark propagator and @xmath33 for the gluon propagator , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath36 , the gauge invariant function @xmath37 , and the symbol @xmath20 stands for the irrelevant terms for our present analysis that will lead to higher - order operators over dimension - six . to use a propagator in momentum - space form as eq.([prop of s3 ] ) has been suggested in the literature already , e.g. it has been suggested to deal with the @xmath38 and @xmath39 couplings in ref.@xcite . however in these discussions , usually the first two terms in the quark - propagator are kept only . for the present case",
    ", one may find that the third term should be kept to provide a more accurate sum rules up to dimension - six operators .",
    "as a special case , by taking only the first - order mass term , we can obtain the quark propagator in the coordinate space , @xmath40 - \\frac{m}{4\\pi^2 x^2 } + \\cdots . \\label{lqp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the quark propagator in momentum space keeps the mass terms naturally , so we shall adopt ( [ prop of s3 ] ) other than ( [ lqp ] ) to do the following calculation .",
