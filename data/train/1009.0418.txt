    "tunneling of a particle is one of the central manifestations of quantum mechanics .",
    "the prototypical example is the tunneling escape from a one - dimensional potential well through an energy barrier . while classically the particle is confined for all times , quantum mechanically the probability inside the well decays exponentially , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the tunneling rate .",
    "it depends on the width and the height of the barrier and can be predicted , e.g. , using wkb theory @xcite .",
    "tunneling vanishes in the semiclassical limit , where typical classical actions are large compared to planck s constant .",
    "tunneling not only occurs for potential barriers but whenever the corresponding classical system consists of dynamically disconnected regions in phase space , which has been termed _ dynamical tunneling _",
    "it occurs in hamiltonian systems which typically have a mixed phase space . here",
    "regions of regular motion , the so - called regular islands , and regions of chaotic motion , the so - called chaotic sea , coexist .",
    "while the classical motion is confined to any of these regions , quantum mechanically they are coupled by dynamical tunneling .",
    "in particular the fundamental process of _ regular - to - chaotic tunneling _ describes the exponential decay of a wave packet initially localized in the regular island to the chaotic sea .",
    "the same coupling also leads to tunneling from the chaotic sea to the regular island .",
    "dynamical tunneling also affects the structure of eigenstates of systems with a mixed phase space . according to the semiclassical eigenfunction hypothesis @xcite the eigenstates",
    "are concentrated either in the regular islands or in the chaotic sea .",
    "away from the semiclassical limit this classification still holds approximately such that the corresponding eigenstates are called regular or chaotic . however , each eigenstate has contributions in the other regions of phase space , due to dynamical tunneling .",
    "dynamical tunneling in a mixed phase space has been studied theoretically @xcite and experimentally , e.g. , in cold atom systems @xcite , microwave billiards @xcite , and semiconductor nanostructures @xcite .",
    "it is of current interest for , e.g. , eigenstates affected by flooding of regular islands @xcite , emission properties of optical microcavities @xcite , and spectral statistics in systems with a mixed phase space @xcite .    the concept of _ chaos - assisted tunneling _ was introduced in refs .",
    "it occurs , e.g. , in systems with two symmetry - related regular islands surrounded by chaotic motion in phase space .",
    "there it was observed that the energy splittings @xmath2 between two symmetry related regular states are typically drastically enhanced due to the appearance of chaotic states , compared to an integrable situation .",
    "chaos - assisted tunneling consists of two processes : a regular - to - chaotic tunneling step from a regular torus of one island to the chaotic sea and a chaotic - to - regular tunneling step from the chaotic sea to the symmetry - related torus .",
    "the energy splittings @xmath2 show strong fluctuations @xcite under variation of external parameters , as the distance between the energies of the regular doublet and the close - by chaotic states varies .",
    "this was also observed for optical microcavities @xcite and microwave billiards @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the energy splittings @xmath2 the regular - to - chaotic tunneling rates @xmath1 describe the average coupling to the chaotic sea , @xmath3 , as shown in sec .  [",
    "sec : cat ] , and therefore do not fluctuate .    in the regime , @xmath4 , in which the planck constant @xmath5 is smaller but of the same order as the area @xmath6 of the regular island , quantum mechanics is not affected by fine - scale structures in phase space , such as nonlinear resonances or the hierarchical transition region .",
    "hence , the _ direct regular - to - chaotic tunneling _ process dominates . in ref .",
    "@xcite a qualitative argument for the tunneling rates to behave exponentially as @xmath7 was given .",
    "one may write @xmath8 , where the non - universal constant @xmath9 has been calculated for various situations in the semiclassical limit : for a weakly chaotic system @xmath10 @xcite was found and @xmath11 for rough nanowires @xcite .",
    "the approach in ref .",
    "@xcite leads semiclassically to @xmath12 which was corrected to @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "however , this prediction does not describe generically shaped regular islands as it uses a transformation of the regular island to a harmonic oscillator .    in order to find a quantitative prediction of direct regular - to - chaotic tunneling rates for generic islands we introduced the fictitious integrable system approach @xcite .",
    "it relies on the decomposition of hilbert space into a regular and a chaotic subspace by means of a fictitious integrable system @xcite .",
    "we require that its dynamics resembles the regular motion in the originally mixed system as closely as possible and extends it beyond the regular region .",
    "this leads to a tunneling formula involving properties of this integrable system as well as its difference to the mixed system under consideration .",
    "it allows for the prediction of tunneling rates from any quantized torus within the regular island .",
    "this approach was applied to quantum maps @xcite , billiard systems @xcite , and optical microcavities @xcite .    in the semiclassical regime , @xmath14 ,",
    "the fine - scale structures of the classical phase space can be resolved by quantum mechanics .",
    "in particular , nonlinear resonances cause an enhancement of the regular - to - chaotic tunneling rates , which has been termed _ resonance - assisted tunneling _",
    "it leads to characteristic peak and plateau structures in the tunneling rates as observed for near integrable systems @xcite , mixed quantum maps @xcite , periodically driven systems @xcite , quantum accelerator modes @xcite , and for multidimensional molecular systems @xcite .",
    "quantitatively , however , deviations of several orders of magnitude to numerical rates appear , especially in the experimentally accessible regime where nonlinear resonances become relevant for tunneling .",
    "recently , it was shown that a combination of the direct regular - to - chaotic tunneling mechanism and the resonance - assisted tunneling mechanism leads to a theory which quantitatively predicts tunneling rates from the quantum to the semiclassical regime @xcite .",
    "for the application of this unified theory it is essential to determine the direct regular - to - chaotic tunneling rates .    in this paper",
