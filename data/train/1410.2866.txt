    "multiscale modeling has been becoming an extremely important tool in many areas of applied sciences @xcite . by combining models from different spatial and temporal scales",
    ", one can describe and simulate complex physical processes with balanced accuracy and efficiency .    for the modeling of mechanical properties of crystalline materials , one notable success is the quasicontinuum ( qc )",
    "method @xcite .",
    "in addition to its applications to numerous nano - mechanical systems , it also serves as a great example , where a conventional continuum ( elasticity ) model can be supplemented with an atomic - level description to appropriately incorporate the needed microscopic structures . since the first emergence of the qc method",
    ", there have been a lot of recent developments aimed at understanding and improving its modeling accuracy @xcite .",
    "in particular , the cauchy - born approximation @xcite in the qc method , which evaluates the elastic energy or the strain - stress relation based on the underlying lattice structures and atomic interactions , has been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "another important issue in such multiscale methods is the consistency of the specific strategy for combining the two models .",
    "this is challenging , especially because the two models are of different nature : the elasticity model is continuous , and is posed in terms of strain and stress ( or energy ) , while the atomistic model is expressed using displacements and interatomic forces .",
    "the inconsistency is manifested , for instance , by the appearance of ghost forces @xcite .",
    "explicit error estimates for the influence of the ghost forces can be found in @xcite for models in one , two , and three dimensions .",
    "meanwhile , a number of methods have been proposed to remove ghost forces .",
    "these include the force correction by ",
    "deadload \" @xcite , the quasi - nonlocal qc method @xcite , and the geometrically consistent scheme @xcite .",
    "more recent efforts include the energy - based atomistic - to - continuum coupling methods @xcite , and the energy - based blended qc method @xcite , _",
    "etc_. nevertheless , in high dimensions when the interface is of general geometry , removing ghost forces in an energy - based method remains an open challenge .",
    "another approach is to couple the two models based on forces , , @xcite .    from the perspective of numerical analysis , how the aforementioned methods approximate a solution of the atomistic model has been of great interest over a decade ; see @xcite for a review and references therein . to address the issue of convergence",
    ", one needs to prove consistency ( free of ghost forces ) and some stability conditions .",
    "thorough studies have been conducted in the one - dimensional case . under some technical conditions",
    ", it has been proven that the quasi - nonlocal qc method converges linearly in @xmath0 norm @xcite .",
    "its convergence rate is @xmath1 if the @xmath2 norm is used with @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it has also been proven that the geometrically consistent qc method converges linearly in @xmath0 norm @xcite .",
    "convergence of the force - based qc method can be found in @xcite with a second - order accuracy @xcite .",
    "there are results in high dimensions as well , , @xcite for a force - based method , and @xcite for an energy - based atomistic / continuum method . also of practical importance",
    "is the adaptive approach based on a systematic error control @xcite .",
    "in addition , convergence of the qc method has also been investigated using the notion of @xmath4convergence @xcite .",
    "numerous numerical results indicate that the error , especially the deformation gradient , exhibits peaks around the interface between the atomistic and continuum regions , regardless of whether ghost forces exist in a coupling method . in the presence of ghost forces , the width of the peak",
    "can be estimated @xcite .",
    "for example , in one space dimension , it is of the order @xmath5 .",
    "the width for a two - dimensional model is @xmath6 motivated by these observations , the current work aims to improve the accuracy at the interface . similarly to the rep - atoms in the original qc framework , we select a number of coarse - grained ( cg ) variables to begin with . to motivate the method , we formulate the atomistic model as a two - stage minimization problem , from which we derive an effective model at the coarse scale .",
    "we further draw the connection to the standard galerkin projection .",
    "a simple calculation shows that in principle the _ exact _ effective model for a given set of cg variables can be derived ; but compared to the galerkin method , it contains an additional term in the stiffness matrix .",
    "the large error near the interface can thus be attributed to having neglected this term . in light of the serious issues with ghost forces , we finally formulate the method as a force - based method , in which the ghost forces do not appear .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to introduce proper approximations of the aforementioned missing term and demonstrate how the approximation reduces the error near the interface .",
    "in particular , we propose to use the krylov subspace approximation and the lanczos algorithm . with the connection to the galerkin method ,",
    "this can be implemented by projecting the atomistic model to an extended subspace .",
    "the additional bases , referred to as _",
    "enriched bases _ , are defined and supported near the interface , which do not require much extra computational cost .",
    "more importantly , unlike the basis functions in the standard galerkin method , they take into account the atomic interactions and improve the modeling accuracy .",
    "currently there is no analytical result that quantifies the numerical error in this approach",
    ". the current method does not show resemblance to any existing approach , and the analysis of the accuracy is still open .",
    "but we have done extensive numerical experiments to show how the enriched bases affect the accuracy .",
    "more specifically , we start with a one - dimensional chain model , a test problem considered in many other works , and conduct extensive numerical tests , including tests on the rate of convergence . in addition , we consider a one - dimensional model of fracture , which in spite of its simplicity , captures some essential aspects of crack propagation . throughout the numerical study ,",
    "our emphasis is focused on the error measured in various norms , some of which have not been considered in previous theoretical analysis .",
    "issues on how to apply the current approach to two- or three - dimensional problems will be discussed in section 2.4 and applications to more important micro - mechanical systems will be considered in subsequent works .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : methodology ] , we derive an effective coarse - grained model for molecular mechanics , and introduce galerkin methods with connection to the qc method .",
    "many numerical studies of galerkin methods and other multiscale methods are presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "consider a system with @xmath7 atoms interacting through the potential function @xmath8 , and let @xmath9 be the external force on the @xmath10-th atom . at zero temperature",
    ", the total energy of the system can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the position of the @xmath10-th atom in the deformed state .",
    "an equilibrium atomic configuration is determined from the following minimization problem : @xmath13 with @xmath14 subject to certain boundary condition .",
    "this is known as the molecular mechanics model .    meanwhile , the displacement of the @xmath10-th atom is defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the reference position of the @xmath10-th atom , typically defined in an undeformed configuration .",
    "we rewrite the minimization problem in terms of the displacement as follows @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we drop the @xmath20 term which will not affect the solution of . in",
    "what follows , a solution of will be considered as the _ exact _ solution for comparison .",
    "although @xmath7 is very large in real applications , only a small number of degrees of freedom is required to adequately describe the displacement field for systems with localized defects , such as point defects , dislocations , and cracks .",
    "this has been the primary motivation for all the existing atomistic to continuum coupling methods .",
    "conceptually , there are two distinct regions , one of which contains local defects , where all the atoms are retained .",
    "the other is the surrounding bulk where the displacement is smooth .",
    "the first region will be referred to as _ atomistic region _ , and the latter will be called the _",
    "continuum region _",
    ", where a reduction of the model is possible . for this purpose ,",
    "let us first introduce general cg variables , denoted by @xmath21 , without having to explicitly specify how the domains are divided .",
    "furthermore , let the number of cg variables be @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "in practice , all the atoms near local defects are chosen , and much fewer atoms are needed in the surrounding region where the displacement is smooth . here , we define the cg variables via a linear operator @xmath24 which connects the fine scale variables @xmath25 to the coarse variables @xmath21 according to the equation @xmath26 this is similar to the restriction operator in multigrid methods @xcite .",
    "we assume that @xmath27 has full rank so that the cg variables are independently defined .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath28 may be regarded as an interpolation operator such that @xmath29 .",
    "this suggests that one can choose standard finite element basis functions to construct @xmath30 more details will be given later .",
    "problem can be formulated into two successive minimization problems @xcite . to explain this",
    ", we first fix the cg variables @xmath21 , and solve @xmath31 using as constraints .",
    "conceptually , to remove the constraints , we may let @xmath32 and write @xmath33 , with the free variable @xmath34 let the resulting minimal energy be @xmath35 .",
    "in the second problem , we solve @xmath36 obtaining a suitable approximation of the effective energy @xmath35 is a general and fundamental problem in molecular modeling @xcite .",
    "the common goal is to derive an effective problem for @xmath21 , from which efficient methods can be used to determine the cg variables . to motivate the proposed procedure ,",
    "we first consider a quadratic potential @xmath37 under this approximation , the exact solution to reads as @xmath38 with @xmath39 as a consequence , the effective model for @xmath21 is given by @xmath40 if the force field is  smooth \" in the sense that it can be approximated by @xmath41 for some @xmath42 , then the euler - lagrange equation of is given by @xmath43 we remark that the reconstruction condition @xmath41 can be satisfied if a problem has localized defects and the cg variables are chosen properly .",
    "the above formulation can be further simplified by introducing @xmath44 , which maps the atomic information to the remaining degrees of freedom after coarse - graining .",
    "@xmath45 is chosen as an orthogonal matrix .",
    "namely , @xmath46 next we let @xmath47 be the orthogonal projection to @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "its complementary projection is @xmath50 using blockwise matrix inversion formulas , we can rewrite the matrix in as follows @xmath51    it is now clear that the _ exact _ effective equation can be rewritten as @xmath52 where @xmath53 these calculations , although quite simple , suggest an important approach to derive accurate coupling methods .",
    "we further comment that    1 .   the formulas above are exact for linearized models . for interested readers",
    ", a more detailed derivation can be found in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "2 .   in equations - , @xmath54 and @xmath55 can be computed provided that @xmath56 and @xmath27 are given .",
    "however , it is difficult to compute @xmath57 since the calculation of the inverse of @xmath58 is almost as difficult as solving the problem . as a result",
    ", we need to approximate @xmath57 using an alternative approach , instead of using directly . in the next section",
    ", we will provide a hierarchy of approximations .",
    "in particular , @xmath54 can be obtained using the standard galerkin method , and @xmath57 corresponds to a galerkin projection to successively extended subspaces .",
    "these calculations are limited to linearized models .",
    "for nonlinear models , we will retain the galerkin formalism , by projecting the full , nonlinear , atomistic model to the extended subspaces .",
    "4 .   in general",
    ", the external force @xmath59 may not be in the range of @xmath28 ; an example will be given later ( see ) .",
    "as a consequence , the displacement field can not be well approximated by basis functions in @xmath27 ; see fig . [",
    "fig : displacementnonlocal ] for the performance of piecewise linear basis functions . in this case ,",
    "high - order basis functions are more appropriate to reduce the approximation error and the enriched bases method can still reduce the error around the interface . 5 .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the concepts of two - stage minimization and enriching procedure has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "the enriching procedure is considered globally to achieve a better approximation due to the internal degrees of freedom .",
    "however , the enriching procedure in section 2.3 is only considered locally to reduce the interfacial error with a compromise between accuracy and efficiency .",
    "if @xmath57 is neglected in , we have @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , it is equivalent to the standard galerkin method , which has been a useful tool for approximating solutions of pdes @xcite . to explain this more precisely , we let @xmath62 we seek @xmath63 , such that , @xmath64 here the parenthesis stands for the standard inner product .",
    "namely , @xmath65    with direct calculations , one can verify that this formulation leads to the stiffness matrix @xmath54 , and the effective equation ( without @xmath57 ) .",
    "this type of weak forms have been used extensively in the adaptive qc methods @xcite .    as a simple illustration",
    ", we consider a test problem , where the atomistic system consists of a chain of atoms with up to the second nearest neighbor interaction .",
    "the setup of the problem is as follows : we include displacements of all the atoms on the right as the cg variables , while on the left , we choose one atom out of every few atoms . the operator @xmath27 is defined based on the standard piecewise linear nodal bases .",
    "the details will be explained in the next section . from fig .",
    "[ fig : displacementerrorstandard2 ] , we observe that the error is concentrated near the interface .",
    "more examples , , figs .",
    "[ fig : displacementerrorstandardinhomogeneous ] and [ fig : displacementerrorcrack1 ] , further support this observation .",
    "therefore , when the error is measured under a uniform norm , , @xmath0 , the error at the interface would dominate .",
    "we attribute this phenomenon to the absence of @xmath57 in the effective model . in fig .",
    "[ fig : displacementerrorstandard3 ] , we plot the @xmath66 norm of each row of @xmath57 as a function of the atomic index .",
    "it is clear that the main contribution of @xmath57 is localized around the interface . in the following section ,",
    "we describe how to incorporate @xmath57 into the model , and through numerous examples , we demonstrate the reduction of the error .",
    "we now try to improve the approximation by introducing an extended approximation . in the case",
    "when the potential is quadratic , this amounts to computing the matrix @xmath57 . since @xmath57 is difficult to compute directly , we will approximate it using a krylov subspace method .",
    "in particular , the expression involves the solution of a linear system with multiple right - hand sides , for which the krylov subspace method is especially useful @xcite .",
    "more specifically , let @xmath67 , and we define @xmath68 for the general theory regarding krylov subspaces , we refer the reader to @xcite . often of practical interest",
    "are the orthogonal bases for @xmath69 , which will be denoted by @xmath70 , and we have @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a block tri - diagonal matrix with dimension @xmath73 .",
    "the error is a matrix with low rank .",
    "thanks to this approximation , we have @xmath74 as a result , @xmath75 where @xmath76.$ ]    to compute the basis vectors , a block lanczos algorithm @xcite can be used .",
    "the detailed algorithm is shown below .",
    "[ alg : blocklanczos ]    set @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "rank revealing qr factorization of the @xmath79 matrix @xmath80 : @xmath81 .",
    "@xmath82 may be a permuted upper triangular matrix ; let @xmath83 @xmath84 be the first @xmath85 columns of @xmath86 , and @xmath87 be the first @xmath85 rows of @xmath82 ; @xmath88 ; @xmath89 ; @xmath90 .    from a practical viewpoint ,",
    "the main difficulty associated with implementing * algorithm * [ alg : blocklanczos ] is due to the fact that the matrix @xmath45 is difficult to access .",
    "furthermore , the algorithm seems to be limited to linear problems . here _",
    "three _ steps are taken to alleviate these difficulties .",
    "first , we define a krylov subspace which is equivalent to ; but it can be implemented much more efficiently . in particular , we consider the krylov space @xmath91 with @xmath92 .",
    "it is easy to check that * algorithm * [ alg : blocklanczos ] , when applied to @xmath93 , yields the same result as the method applied to @xmath94 .",
    "the advantage of is that @xmath95 can be obtained as the complementary projection of @xmath96 , which can be computed from @xmath30    secondly , we recall the previous observation that the error introduced in the standard galerkin method tends to center around the interface between the continuum region and the atomistic region .",
    "therefore we only choose _ a subset of _ basis functions in @xmath27 , which correspond to the basis functions around the interface . to make it more specific , we let @xmath97 be the matrix that contains @xmath98 additional basis functions with @xmath99 , and we define @xmath100 , and accordingly , @xmath101 .",
    "since the atomic interaction is assumed to be of finite range , these additional basis functions still have compact supports , which makes the lanczos algorithm feasible in the current setting .",
    "once the krylov subspace is generated , we define an extended space by @xmath102 the additional basis functions depend on the force constant matrix @xmath56 . unlike the basis functions in @xmath27 ,",
    "they incorporate the atomic interactions . motivated by this observation",
    ", these basis functions will be referred to as _",
    "enriched bases .",
    "_    at the third step , we return to the fully nonlinear atomistic model .",
    "we will project the full ( and nonlinear ) model to the subspace @xmath103 using a galerkin projection : we seek @xmath104 , such that @xmath105 this weak form was also used in the adaptive qc methods @xcite .",
    "clearly , this galerkin formulation is based on the force balance , rather than a minimization of the energy , which might suffer from the issues of the ghost forces .",
    "the above three steps constitute the main components of the enriched bases method . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss how to approximate the inner products in the weak forms .      to reduce the computational cost in and , we introduce quadrature approximations in the continuum region where the displacement is smooth .",
    "notice that the enriched bases are only confined to a neighborhood of the interface , so the standard galerkin method and the enriched bases methods have the same set of basis functions in the interior of the continuum region , and our discussion on the quadrature approximation applies to both methods",
    ".    there are three terms that need to be approximated using the quadrature rule in : @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 . as an example",
    ", we consider the case where the continuum region has been equipped with elements : intervals ( 1d ) , triangles ( 2d ) , and tetrahedrons ( 3d ) , with basis @xmath109 being a standard piecewise linear function which forms the @xmath110-th row of @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath10 and @xmath110 be two vertices of an interval @xmath111 in 1d ( or a triangle in 2d and a tetrahedron in 3d ) .",
    "the @xmath112 component of @xmath113 can be computed as @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the volume of the unit cell .",
    "this integral can be further approximated by standard quadrature formulas .",
    "we can approximate the components of @xmath116 and @xmath117 by @xmath118 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 are supports of @xmath121 and @xmath109 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath122 and @xmath123 can be identified as the first piola - kirchhoff stress tensor and the lagrangian tangent stiffness tensor , respectively .",
    "the detailed construction of @xmath122 and @xmath123 from the atomistic model can be found in @xcite .",
    "both integrals can be further approximated by standard quadrature formulas .",
    "interested readers may find earlier discussions on quadrature approximations in @xcite for static problems and @xcite for dynamics problems .    in the standard galerkin method ,",
    "if we use piecewise linear functions as basis functions and the mid - point rule for the quadrature approximation for all elements in , we get the local qc method @xcite .",
    "once the quadrature approximation is used in galerkin methods , three regions arise : the atomistic region where the force is treated  as is \" , one continuum region with the quadrature approximation , which is equivalent to a finite element approximation of an elasticity model , and one region in between with no quadrature approximation .",
    "this region at the interface will be referred to as the _ interbedded region _",
    ", which is considered as an addition to the original qc method to specifically reduce the coupling error .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : qa2d ] .",
    "kinematically , the number of degrees of freedom in the interbedded region is reduced by introducing rep - atoms ( coarse grained elements ) .",
    "however , energies or forces over these elements are still calculated based on the summation of site energies or site forces per atom .",
    "therefore , atoms in the interbedded region act as _ quasiatoms _ , which play a similar transitional role to the quasi - nonlocal atoms @xcite .    clearly , formulas presented here and the galerkin projection are valid in high dimensions as well . in fig .",
    "[ fig : qa2d ] we have illustrated how this can be implemented in 2d . more specifically , the enriched bases will be introduced in the elements next to the interface ( green ) , and in those elements , the forces are evaluated exactly . on the other hand , in elements further away from the interface ( white ) , the quadrature formulas shown above are used to compute the average forces .",
    "this part is equivalent to the local qc method .",
    "in fact , this procedure for approximating the forces has been implemented in @xcite , although in different settings .",
    "the original qc method @xcite and other multiscale methods without ghost forces @xcite share the similarity that the error in a multiscale method is dominated around the interface . in our approach , on the one hand , the error in the interbedded region decays quickly away from the interface between the interbedded region and the atomistic region . at the interface between the continuum region and the interbedded region",
    ", the quadrature approximation will make an error , which is often much smaller compared with the error at the interface between the interbedded region and the atomistic region . on the other hand , there is no energetic reduction for quasiatoms in the interbedded region .",
    "the enriched bases can be naturally added in the framework of a galerkin method , which can reduce the error between the interbedded region and the atomistic region significantly . moreover ,",
    "the quadrature approximation and the enrichment are combined in a concurrent way .",
    "one helps the other , and vice versa .",
    "this leads to a much better approximation to the atomistic model without increasing the computational complexity .",
    "all these will be verified by simulation results in section [ sec : results ] .",

    "the following methods will be considered : the standard galerkin method with a uniform mesh , the standard galerkin method with a nonuniform mesh , the quasi - nonlocal qc method @xcite , the force - based qc method @xcite , the enriched bases method with a uniform mesh , and the enriched bases method with a nonuniform mesh .",
    "all the meshes considered here are fixed as the system size is enlarged .",
    "all atoms are chosen as rep - atoms in the quasi - nonlocal qc method and the force - based qc method .",
    "[ fig : errorconvergence ] shows the rate of convergence of the first four methods in @xmath162 norm , @xmath163 norm , and @xmath0 norm , respectively .",
    "all the methods have a first - order convergence in @xmath0 norm , even though the external force considered here is only in @xmath164)\\cap\\rm{bv}([0,1])$ ] .",
    "galerkin methods and the quasi - nonlocal qc method have a 3/2-order convergence in @xmath163 norm , while the force - based qc method only has a first - order convergence in @xmath163 norm .",
    "galerkin methods and the quasi - nonlocal qc method have a second - order convergence in @xmath162 norm , while the force - based qc method has a first - order convergence in @xmath162 norm .",
    "these results are somewhat unexpected since the external force is only in @xmath164)\\cap\\rm{bv}([0,1])$ ] , while higher regularities are required for theoretical studies of the quasi - nonlocal qc method @xcite and the force - based qc method @xcite .",
    "it has been proven in @xcite that , for the quasi - nonlocal qc method , if @xmath165 then a uniform convergence rate in @xmath0 is obtained ; and in @xcite that if the solution of the atomistic model is in @xmath166 then the convergence rate in the @xmath2 norm is @xmath1 for @xmath3 . for the force - based qc method",
    ", it has also been proven that if @xmath165 one gets a uniform convergence rate in @xmath0 @xcite , and if the solution of the atomistic model is in @xmath167 , then the convergence rate in @xmath0 is quadratic . in this example",
    "@xmath168)\\cap{\\rm bv}([0,1])$ ] , and it is not yet clear how the theoretical analysis can be extended to this case .",
    "quantitatively , the standard galerkin method on a nonuniform mesh provides a better approximation to the atomistic model .",
    "even though the same convergence rate is obtained in the @xmath0 norm for these methods , the prefactor in the standard galerkin method on a nonuniform mesh is smaller that those in the quasi - nonlocal qc method and the force - based qc method .",
    "the prefactor in the galerkin method with a nonuniform mesh can be one order of magnitude smaller than that in the quasi - nonlocal qc method and a couple of orders of magnitude smaller than that in the force - based qc method .",
    "we can also see that the galerkin method has a larger prefactor than those in the quasi - nonlocal qc method and the force - based qc method if a uniform mesh is used for @xmath0 norm .",
    "this suggests that a smooth transition of the mesh size from the atomistic region to the continuum region is desirable to reduce the error . after the quadrature approximation , atoms near the interface in the continuum region work as quasiatoms , which might explain why the corresponding galerkin method outperforms other methods .",
    "-3em    in table [ tab : extendeduniform ] we show the @xmath162 , @xmath163 , and @xmath0 norms of the error for the enriched bases method with a uniform mesh",
    ". with a fixed number of enriched bases @xmath169 around the interface , the error drops quickly at the beginning and then follows corresponding convergence rates of the method in three norms .",
    "this is mainly due the to deficiency of enriched bases for smaller @xmath126 .",
    "moreover , the prefactor in this example is roughly one order of magnitude smaller than that of the standard galerkin method with a uniform mesh in the previous example , which shows the technique of enrichment is still an efficient way to reduce the error .    .@xmath162 ,",
    "@xmath163 , and @xmath0 norms of the error for the enriched bases method with a uniform mesh . with a fixed number of enriched bases @xmath170 around the interface ,",

    "the reduction of the error slows down due to the deficiency of enriched bases for smaller @xmath126 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from a practical viewpoint , only a small fraction of atoms around localized defects should be kept , and all remaining atoms should be coarse - grained .",
    "so in the last test , we consider the case where only a few atoms around the crack tip are kept and all remaining atoms are coarse grained .",
    "this gives a partition of the system .",
    "[ fig : displacementcrackcac ] shows displacement errors of galerkin methods .",
    "it is clear that this coupling , which involves much fewer degrees of freedom , offers a good approximation .    -5em",
    "we derived an effective coarse - grained model starting with molecular mechanics as an exact model .",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasize that we do not introduce the continuum model to begin with .",
    "rather , we work with a pre - selected cg variables . the exact model can be projected to a subspace , which naturally leads to the standard galerkin method .",
    "due to the lack of direct physical significance of the basis functions , the approximation may not have sufficient accuracy .",
    "we proposed to improve the modeling accuracy by using the enriched bases method , which is based on introducing more basis functions at the interface .",
    "we have used the krylov subspaces and the block lanczos algorithm to automate this procedure .",
    "both methods have been systematically tested and compared with some other coupling methods .",
    "although currently there is no theoretical analysis , the numerical experiments have indicated excellent performances both quantitatively and qualitatively .",
    "the introduction of the quadrature approximation , the interbedded region , and quasiatoms has made the computational complexity of our methods comparable to other methods but with better performances .",
    "application of our methods for high dimensional problems will be presented in future works .",
    "another interesting issue is the performance of the enriched bases method if enriched bases are used in the energy - based framework of the galerkin method since ghost forces appear as a consequence of the quadrature approximation .",
