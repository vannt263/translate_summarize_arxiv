    "in our proposal of quantum computing with noisy operations , we consider a system composed of two coupled subsystems @xmath4 and @xmath5 , in which the subsystem @xmath4 ( actuator ) directly suffers noisy operations , and the subsystem @xmath5 is a register storing the quantum state for processing . by frequently performing noisy operations ,",
