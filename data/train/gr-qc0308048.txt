    "[ intro ]    quantum gravity remains an outstanding problem of fundamental physics .",
    "the bottom line is we do nt even know the nature of the system that should be quantized .",
    "the spacetime metric may well be just a collective description of some more basic stuff .",
    "the fact@xcite that the semi - classical einstein equation can be derived by demanding that the first law of thermodynamics hold for local causal horizons , assuming the proportionality of entropy and area , leads one to suspect that the metric is only meaningful in the thermodynamic limit of something else . this led me at first to suggest that the metric should nt be quantized at all .",
    "however i think this is wrong . condensed matter physics abounds with examples of collective modes that become meaningless at short length scales , and which are nevertheless accurately treated as quantum fields within the appropriate domain .",
    "( consider for example the sound field in a bose - einstein condensate of atoms , which loses meaning at scales below the so - called  healing length \" , which is still several orders of magnitude longer than the atomic size of the fundamental constituents . ) similarly , there exists a perfectly good perturbative approach to quantum gravity in the framework of low energy effective field theory@xcite .",
    "however , this is not regarded as a solution to the problem of quantum gravity , since the most pressing questions are non - perturbative in nature : the nature and fate of spacetime singularities , the fate of cauchy horizons , the nature of the microstates counted by black hole entropy , and the possible unification of gravity with other interactions .    at a shallower level ,",
    "the perturbative approach of effective field theory is nevertheless relevant both for its indications about the deeper questions and for its application to physics phenomena in their own right .",
    "it leads in particular to the subject of quantum field theory in curved spacetime backgrounds , and the  back - reaction \" of the quantum fields on such backgrounds .",
    "some of the most prominent of these applications are the hawking radiation by black holes , primordial density perturbations , and early universe phase transitions .",
    "it also fits into the larger category of quantum field theory ( qft ) in inhomogeneous and/or time - dependent backgrounds of other fields or matter media , and is also intimately tied to non - inertial effects in flat space qft such as the unruh effect . the pertubative approach is also known as  semi - classical quantum gravity \" , which refers to the setting where there is a well - defined classical background geometry about which the quantum fluctuations are occuring .",
    "the present notes are an introduction to some of the essentials and phenomena of quantum field theory in curved spacetime .",
    "familiarity with quantum mechanics and general relativity are assumed . where computational steps are omitted i expect that the reader can fill these in as an exercise .",
    "given the importance of the subject , it is curious that there are not very many books dedicated to it .",
    "the standard reference by birrell and davies@xcite was published twenty years ago , and another monograph by grib , mamaev , and mostapanenko@xcite , half of which addresses strong background field effects in flat spacetime , was published two years earlier originally in russian and then in english ten years ago .",
    "two books with a somewhat more limited scope focusing on fundamentals with a mathematically rigorous point of view are those by fulling@xcite and wald@xcite .",
    "this year dewitt@xcite published a comprehensive two volume treatise with a much wider scope but including much material on quantum fields in curved spacetime .",
    "a number of review articles ( see e.g. @xcite ) and many shorter introductory lecture notes ( see e.g. @xcite ) are also available . for more information on topics not explicitly referenced in the text of these notes the above references should be consulted .    in these notes",
    "the units are chosen with @xmath2 but @xmath3 and @xmath4 are kept explicit .",
    "the spacetime signature is @xmath5 .",
    "please send corrections if you find things here that are wrong .",
    "thanks to a scale separation it is useful to distinguish quantum field theory in a curved background spacetime ( qftcs ) from true quantum gravity ( qg ) . before launching into the qftcs formalism , it seems worthwhile to have a quick look at some of the interesting issues that qftcs is concerned with .",
    "it is usually presumed that the length scale of quantum gravity is the planck length @xmath6 cm .",
    "the corresponding energy scale is @xmath7 gev .",
    "braneworld scenarios \" , in which our 4d world is a hypersurface in a higher dimensional spacetime , put the scale of quantum gravity much lower , at around a tev , corresponding to @xmath8 cm . in either case , there is plenty of room for applicability of qftcs .",
    "( on the other hand , we are much closer to seeing true qg effects in tev scale qg",
    ". for example we might see black hole creation and evaporation in cosmic rays or accelerators . )    here i will assume planck scale qg , and look at some dimensional analysis to give a feel for the phenomena .",
    "first , how should we think of the planck scale ?",
    "the hilbert - einstein action is @xmath9 . for a spacetime region with radius of curvature @xmath10 and 4-volume @xmath11",
    "the action is @xmath12 .",
    "this suggests that quantum curvature fluctuations with radius less than the planck length @xmath13 are unsuppressed .",
    "another way to view the significance of the planck length is as the minimum localization length @xmath14 , in the sense that if @xmath15 a black hole swallows the @xmath14 . to see this , note that the uncertainty relation @xmath16 implies @xmath17 which implies @xmath18 .",
    "associated with this uncertain energy is a schwarzschild radius @xmath19 , hence quantum mechanics and gravity imply @xmath20 .",
    "the uncertain @xmath21 is less than @xmath14 only if @xmath22 .      before hawking , spherically symmetric",
    ", static black holes were assumed to be completely inert .",
    "in fact , it seems more natural that they can decay , since there is no conservation law preventing that .",
    "the decay is quantum mechanical , and thermal : hawking found that a black hole radiates at a temperature proportional to @xmath3 , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the surface gravity .",
    "the fact that the radiation is thermal is even natural , for _ what else could it be _ ?",
    "the very nature of the horizon is a causal barrier to information , and yet the hawking radiation emerges from just outside the horizon .",
    "hence there can be no information in the hawking radiation , save for the mass of the black hole which is visible on the outside , so it must be a maximum entropy state , i.e. a thermal state with a temperature determined by the black hole mass .    for a schwarzschild black hole @xmath25 , so the hawking temperature is inversely proportional to the mass .",
    "this implies a thermal wavelength @xmath26 , a purely geometrical relationship which indicates two things .",
    "first , although the emission process involves quantum mechanics , its  kinematics \" is somehow classical .",
    "second , as long as the schwarzschild radius is much longer than the planck length , it should be possible to understand the hawking effect using only qftcs , i.e. semi - classical qg .",
    "( actually one must also require that the back - reaction is small , in the sense that the change in the hawking temperature due to the emission of a single hawking quantum is small .",
    "this fails to hold for for a very nearly extremal black hole@xcite . )",
    "a planck mass ( @xmath27 gm ) black hole ",
    "if it could be treated semi - classically  would have a schwarzschild radius of order the planck length ( @xmath28 cm ) and a hawking temperature of order the planck energy ( @xmath29 gev ) . from this the hawking temperatures for other black holes can be found by scaling .",
    "a solar mass black hole has a schwarzschild radius @xmath30 km hence a hawking temperature @xmath31 times smaller than the planck energy , i.e. @xmath32 gev .",
    "evaluated more carefully it works out to @xmath33 k. for a mini black hole of mass @xmath34 gm one has @xmath35 cm and @xmath36 mev .",
    "the  back reaction \" , i.e. the response of the spacetime metric to the hawking process , should be well approximated by the semi - classical einstein equation @xmath37 provided it is a small effect . to assess the size , we can compare the stress tensor to the background curvature near the horizon ( not to @xmath38 , since that vanishes in the background ) .",
    "the background riemann tensor components are @xmath39 ( in suitable freely falling reference frame ) , while for example the energy density is @xmath40 .",
    "hence @xmath41 , which is much less than the background curvature provided @xmath42 , i.e. provided the black hole is large compared to the planck length .    although a tiny effect for astrophysical black holes , the hawking process has a profound implication : black holes can  evaporate \" .",
    "how long does one take to evaporate ?",
    "it emits roughly one hawking quantum per light crossing time , hence @xmath43 . in planck units",
    "@xmath44 , we have @xmath45 .",
    "integration yields the lifetime @xmath46 . for the @xmath47 gm , @xmath48 cm black hole mentioned",
    "earlier we have @xmath49 cm , which is the age of the universe .",
    "hence a black hole of that mass in the early universe would be explosively ending its life now .",
    "these are called  primordial black holes \" ( pbh s ) .",
    "none have been knowingly observed so far , nor their detritus , which puts limits on the present density of pbh s ( see for example the references in@xcite ) .",
    "however , it has been suggested@xcite that they might nevertheless be the source of the highest energy ( @xmath50 ev ) cosmic rays .",
    "note that even if pbh s were copiously produced in the early universe , their initial number density could easily have been inflated away if they formed before inflation .",
    "how about the black hole entropy ?",
    "the thermodynamic relation @xmath51 ( for a black hole with no angular momentum or charge ) implies @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the black hole horizon area .",
    "what is this huge entropy ?",
    "what microstates does it count ?    whatever the microstates may be , @xmath54 is the lower bound for the entropy emitted to the outside world as the black hole evaporates , i.e. the minimal missing information brought about by the presence of the black hole . by sending energy into a black hole",
    "one could make it last forever , emitting an arbitrarily large amount of entropy , so it only makes sense to talk about the minimal entropy .",
    "this lower bound is attained when the black hole evaporates reversibly into a thermal bath at a temperature infinitesimally below @xmath55 .",
    "( evaporation into vacuum is irreversible , so the total entropy of the outside increases even more@xcite , @xmath56 . )",
    "this amounts to a huge entropy increase .",
    "the only way out of this conclusion would be if the semi - classical analysis breaks down for some reason ... which is suspected by many , not including me .",
    "the so - called  information paradox \" refers to the loss of information associated with this entropy increase when a black hole evaporates , as well as to the loss of any other information that falls into the black hole .",
    "i consider it no paradox at all , but many think it is a problem to be avoided at all costs .",
    "i think this viewpoint results from missing the strongly non - perturbative role of quantum gravity in evolving the spacetime into and beyond the classically singular region , whether by generating baby universes or otherwise ( see section [ infoloss ] for more discussion of this point ) .",
    "unfortunately it appears unlikely that semi - classical qg can  prove \" that information is or is not lost , though people have tried hard . for it not to be lost there would have to be subtle effects not captured by semi - classical qg , yet in a regime where semi - classical description  should \" be the whole story at leading order .",
    "one can study a lot of interesting issues with free fields in curved spacetime , and i will restrict entirely to that case except for a brief discussion .",
    "free fields in curved spacetime are similar to collections of harmonic oscillators with time - dependent frequencies .",
    "i will therefore begin by developing the properties of a one - dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator in a formalism parallel to that used in quantum field theory .",
    "the action for a particle of mass @xmath57 moving in a time dependent potential @xmath58 in one dimension takes the form s = dt l  l = m^2 - v(x , t ) from which follows the equation of motion @xmath59 .",
    "canonical quantization proceeds by ( i ) defining the momentum conjugate to @xmath60 , @xmath61 , ( ii ) replacing @xmath60 and @xmath62 by operators @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and ( iii ) imposing the canonical commutation relations @xmath65=i\\hbar$ ] .",
    "the operators are represented as hermitian linear operators on a hilbert space , the hermiticity ensuring that their spectrum is real as befits a quantity whose classical correspondent is a real number . ] in the schrdinger picture the state is time - dependent , and the operators are time - independent . in the position representation for example the momentum operator is given by @xmath66 . in the heisenberg picture",
    "the state is time - independent while the operators are time - dependent .",
    "the commutation relation then should hold at each time , but this is still really only one commutation relation since the the equation of motion implies that if it holds at one initial time it will hold at all times . in terms of the position and velocity , the commutation relation(s ) in the heisenberg picture",
    "take the form = i / m . [ cr]here and from here on the hats distinguishing numbers from operators are dropped .",
    "specializing now to a harmonic oscillator potential @xmath67 the equation of motion takes the form + ^2(t)x=0.[ho(t ) ] consider now any operator solution @xmath68 to this equation .",
    "since the equation is second order the solution is determined by the two hermitian operators @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and since the equation is linear the solution is linear in these operators .",
    "it is convenient to trade the pair @xmath69 and @xmath70 for a single time - independent non - hermitian operator @xmath71 , in terms of which the solution is written as x(t ) = f(t ) a + |f(t ) , [ xoperator]where @xmath72 is a complex function satisfying the classical equation of motion , + ^2(t)f=0,[fho]@xmath73 is the complex conjugate of @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is the hermitian conjugate of @xmath71",

    "let us now assume that the solution @xmath74 is chosen so that the real number @xmath78 is positive .",
    "then by rescaling @xmath74 we can arrange to have f , f=1 .",
    "[ fnorm ] in this case the commutation relation ( [ cr2 ] ) becomes = 1 , [ cra]the standard relation for the harmonic oscillator raising and lowering operators . using the bracket with the operator @xmath60 we can pluck out the raising and lowering operators from the position operator , a = f , x,=-|f , x .",
    "[ pluckout]since both @xmath74 and @xmath60 satisfy the equation of motion , the brackets in ( [ pluckout ] ) are time independent as they must be .",
    "a hilbert space representation of the operators can be built by introducing a state @xmath79 defined to be normalized and satisfying @xmath80 . for each @xmath81 ,",
    "the state @xmath82 is a normalized eigenstate of the number operator @xmath83 with eigenvalue @xmath81 .",

    "a change in @xmath72 could be accompanied by a change in @xmath71 that keeps the solution @xmath68 unchanged . in the special case of a constant frequency @xmath84",
    "however , the energy is conserved , and a special choice of @xmath72 is selected if we require that the state @xmath79 be the ground state of the hamiltonian .",

    "this notion is useful at high enough wave vectors locally in any spacetime , and for essentially all wave vectors asymptotically in spacetimes that are asymptotically flat in the past or the future or both .    more generally , however , the notion of a  particle \" is ambiguous in curved spacetime , and one should use field observables to characterize states .",
    "one such observable determines how a  particle detector \" coupled to the field would respond were it following some particular worldline in spacetime and the coupling were adiabatically turned on and off at prescribed times .",

    "this difference is well - defined ( with a suitable regulator ) and finite for any two states sharing the same singular short distance behavior .",
    "the result depends of course upon the comparison state .",
    "since the divergence is associated with the very short wavelength modes , it might seem that to uniquely define the expectation value at a point @xmath60 it should suffice to just subtract the infinities for a state defined as the vacuum in the local flat spacetime approximation at @xmath60 . this subtraction is ambiguous however , even after making it as local as possible and ensuring local conservation of energy ( @xmath152 ) .",

    "we evaluate the expectation value @xmath288 of the number operator @xmath289 in the quantum state @xmath120 of the field .",
    "this does not fully characterize the state , but it will lead directly to considerations that do .",

    "to evaluate the expectation value of @xmath291 we use the field equation satisfied by @xmath91 to relate @xmath291 to an observable on an earlier slice @xmath292 on which we know enough about the quantum state .",
    "specifically , we assume there are no incoming excitations long after the black hole forms , and we assume that the state looks like the vacuum at very short distances ( or high frequencies ) as seen by observers falling across the event horizon .",
    "hawking originally propagated the field through the time - dependent collapsing part of the metric and back out all the way to spatial infinity , where he assumed @xmath120 to be the incoming vacuum at very high frequencies . as pointed out by unruh@xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) the result can be obtained without propagating all the way back , but rather stopping on a spacelike surface @xmath292 far to the past of @xmath290 but still after the formation of the black hole .",
    "this is important since propagation back out to infinity invokes arbitrarily high frequency modes whose behavior may not be given by the standard relativistic free field theory .",
    "if @xmath292 lies far enough to the past of @xmath290 , the wavepacket @xmath287 propagated backwards by the klein - gordon equation breaks up into two distinct parts , p = r+t .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ collapsefig ] . )",
    "@xmath96 is the  reflected \" part that scatters from the black hole and returns to large radii , while @xmath185 is the  transmitted \" part that approaches the horizon .",
    "@xmath96 has support only at large radii , and @xmath185 has support only in a very small region just outside the event horizon where it oscillates very rapidly due to the backwards gravitational blueshift . since both the wavepacket @xmath287 and the field operator @xmath91 satisfy the klein - gordon equation , the klein - gordon inner product in ( [ a(p ) ] ) can be evaluated on @xmath292 instead of @xmath290 without changing @xmath293 .",
    "this yields a corresponding decomposition for the annihilation operator , a(p)=a(r)+a(t ) .",
    "thus we have     now it follows from the stationarity of the black hole metric that the killing frequencies in a solution of the kg equation are conserved . hence the wavepackets @xmath96 and @xmath185 both have the same , purely positive killing , frequency components as @xmath287 . as @xmath96 lies far from the black hole in the nearly flat region , this means that it has purely positive asymptotic minkowski frequencies , hence the operator @xmath294 is a _ bona fide _ annihilation operator  or rather @xmath295 times the annihilation operator  for incoming excitations . assuming that long after the black hole forms there are no such incoming excitations , we have @xmath296 .",

    "( the last reference in @xcite is a review . )",
    "however this is regularization dependent and hence difficult to interpret physically , and moreover at least in dimensional regularization vector fields and some non - minimally coupled scalars contribute _ negatively _ to renormalizing @xmath4 , which does not seem to match the entanglement entropy .",
    "there has been much work in this area but it remains to be fully understood .",
    "two types of potential information loss occur in black hole physics .",
    "first , when something falls into a black hole any information it carries is apparently lost to the outside world .",
    "second , when a black hole radiates hawking quanta , each radiated quantum is entangled with a partner lying inside the horizon , as eqn .",
    "( [ u ] ) shows .",
    "as long as the black hole does not evaporate completely , all information remains available on a spacelike surface that crosses the horizon and enters the black hole .",
    "if on the other hand the black hole evaporates completely , then no single spacelike surface stretching to infinity and filling  all space \" can capture all information , according to the semi - classical analysis of the hawking effect .",
    "rather a disconnected surface behind the horizon must be included .",
    "the information on this disconnected surface flows into the strong curvature region at the singularity , where its fate is not yet understood .",
    "this situation has generated much discussion .",
    "some researchers ( myself included ) see the information loss to the outside world not as a sign of the breakdown of quantum mechanics but just as a consequence of the mutability of spatial topology in quantum gravity .",
    "when a black hole is about to evaporate completely it looks very small to the world outside the horizon .",
    "however this outside smallness has absolutely nothing to do with the size of the region inside available for storing information .",
    "let us look into this a bit more .",
    "consider for example the spacelike singularity at @xmath400 inside the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the metric in eddington - finkelstein coordinates is ds^2 = ( 1-r_s / r)dv^2 -2 dv dr - r^2(d^2 + ^2d^2 ) , where @xmath320 is the advanced time coordinate defined below ( [ null ] ) . inside the horizon , where @xmath401 , a line of constant @xmath402 is spacelike , and has a proper length @xmath403",
    "this goes to infinity as the singularity is approached , _ for any interval of advanced time _ @xmath404 .",
    "hence there is no dearth of space inside .",
    "on the other hand , the transverse angular dimensions go to zero size , and also we do not know how to describe the spacetime too near to the singularity",
    ". therefore let s stop at the radius where the curvature @xmath405 is equal to the planck curvature , i.e at @xmath406 in planck units .",
    "then then proper length goes as @xmath407 . for a solar mass black hole",
    "we have @xmath408 in planck units , so @xmath409 .",
    "that means that for an external advanced time of @xmath410 second , the proper length inside is one million light years . after a day or so , the length is the size of the universe , and so on over the hawking lifetime @xmath411 .",
    "what happens to the future of this _ spacelike _ @xmath412 cylinder inside the black hole is governed by quantum gravity .",
    "we do nt know what form the evolution takes .",
    "it is conceivable that time just stops running , like a frozen engine , producing a boundary of spacetime .",
    "it seems much more likely however that spacetime persists beyond , either into  quantum foam \" or into a plump baby universe ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) or universes@xcite . in any of these scenarios , the tiny outside size of a black hole at the end stage of hawking evaporation is no indication of the information carrying capacity of the interior .",
    "others believe that the validity of quantum mechanics requires that all information winds up available on the exterior slice after the evaporation .",
    "results from string theory are often invoked to support this viewpoint .",
    "( for a critique of these arguments see @xcite . )",
    "if true , it would require some breakdown of the semi - classical description where none seems to be otherwise called for .",
    "the role of ultra high frequencies in the hawking effect is often brought up in this context , however they are irrelevant since the derivation of the correlated structure of the vacuum and the hawking effect does not need to access those frequencies . for",
    "more on this see the discussion of the trans - planckian question in section [ tpq ] .",
    "the hawking flux continues in a steady state long after the collapse that forms a black hole , which suggests that the collapse phase has nothing to do with the hawking effect .",
    "indeed the derivation given above makes use of only the free - fall vacuum conditions near the horizon , and the collapse phase plays no role . on the other hand if , as hawking originally did , we follow the positive killing frequency wavepacket @xmath185 all the way backwards in time , it would go through the collapse phase and back out to infinity where killing frequency and free - fall frequency coincide .",
    "were it not for the time dependence of the background during the collapse , there would be no change of the killing frequency , so there would be no negative frequency part of the ingoing wavepacket and there would be no particle creation .",
    "as discussed in the following section this propagation through the collapse phase invokes ultra high frequency field modes , and therefore may not even be physically relevant .",
    "however it seems clear is that whatever physics delivers the outgoing vacuum near the horizon , it must involve some violation of the time translation symmetry of the classical black hole background , even if it does not involve the collapse phase . in the lattice model of section [ lattice ]",
    "the violation arises from microscopic time dependence of the lattice spacing . in quantum gravity",
    "it may come just from the quantum gravitational fluctuations ( see section [ latticetimedep ] ) .",
    "[ tpq ]    a deep question arises on account of the infinite redshift at the black hole horizon : do the outgoing modes that carry the hawking radiation really emerge from a reservoir of modes with frequency arbitrarily far beyond the planck frequency just outside the horizon , or is there another possibility ? does the existence or properties of the hawking effect depend on the existence of such a _ trans - planckian reservoir _ ?",
    "the reasoning leading to the expression ( [ u ] ) for the unruh state in terms of positive killing frequency modes is largely shielded from this question .",
    "the essential input is the free - fall vacuum conditions ( [ uvacuum ] ) , which can be applied at any length or time scale much shorter than the schwarzschild radius and inverse surface gravity ( which are roughly the same unless the black hole is near extremally rotating or charged ) .",
    "there is no need to appeal to planckian or trans - planckian frequencies .    from this persepctive",
    "it is clear that , as far as the derivation of the hawking effect is concerned , the only question is whether or not the free - fall vacuum in fact arises at short distances near the horizon from the initial conditions before collapse . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the modes with frequencies much higher than the inverse of the collapse time scale would be expected to remain unexcited .",
    "nevertheless , in standard relativistic field theory these modes arise from trans - planckian modes .",
    "consider an outgoing wavepacket near the horizon and peaked around frequency @xmath413 as measured by a free - fall observer crossing the horizon at the advanced time @xmath414 . at an earlier time",
    "@xmath415 , the wavepacket would be blueshifted and squeezed closer to the horizon , with exponentially higher free - fall frequency ,",
    "/_1^ff~e^v = e^v/2 r_s . for a solar mass black hole and @xmath416 seconds",
    ", the ratio is @xmath417 .    to _ predict _ the state of the positive free - fall frequency modes @xmath310 and @xmath311 from the initial state thus seems to require trans - planckian physics .",
    "this is a breakdown of the usual separation of scales invoked in the application of effective field theory and it leaves some room for doubt@xcite about the existence of the hawking effect .",
    "while the physical arguments for the hawking effect do seem quite plausible , the trans - planckian question is nevertheless pressing .",
    "after all , there are reasons to suspect that the trans - planckian modes do not even _",
    "exist_. they imply an infinite contribution to black hole entanglement entropy from quantum fields , and they produce other divergences in quantum field theory that are not desirable in a fundamental theory .",
    "the trans - planckian question is really two - fold :    is the hawking effect _ universal _ , i.e. insensitive to short distance physics , or at least can it be reliably derived in a quantum gravity theory with acceptable short distance behavior ?",
    "if there is no trans - planckian reservoir , from where do the outgoing black hole modes arise ?",
    "string theory has made impressive progress towards answering the first question , at least for some special black holes . in particular@xcite ,",
    "some near - extremal black holes become well - understood d - brane configurations in the weak coupling limit , and supersymmetry links the weak coupling to strong coupling results .",
    "thus the hawking effect can be reliably analyzed in a full quantum gravity theory . by a rather remarkable and unexpected correspondence",
    "the computations yield agreement with the semi - classical predictions , at least in the long wavelength limit .",
    "moreover , the d - brane entropy is understood in terms of the counting of microstates , and agrees with the corresponding black hole entropy at strong coupling , just as the supersymmetry reasoning says it should . from yet another angle ,",
    "the ads / cft duality in string theory offers other support@xcite .",
    "there the hawking effect and black hole entropy are interpreted in terms of a thermal state of the cft ( a conformally invariant super - yang - mills theory ) . however , neither of these approaches from string theory has so far been exploited to address the origin of the outgoing modes , since a local spacetime picture of the black hole horizon is lacking .",
    "this seems to be a question worth pursuing .",
    "condensed matter physics provides an analogy for effective field theory with a fundamental cutoff , hence it can be used to explore the consequences of a missing trans - planckian reservoir .",
    "( for a review of these ideas see @xcite , and for a very brief summary see @xcite . )",
    "the first such black hole analog was unruh s sonic black hole , which consists of a fluid with an inhomogeneous flow exceeding the speed of sound at a sonic horizon .",
    "a molecular fluid does not support wavelengths shorter than the intermolecular spacing , hence the sonic horizon has no  trans - molecular \" reservoir of outgoing modes .",
    "unruh found that nevertheless outgoing modes are produced , by a process of  mode conversion \" from ingoing to outgoing modes .",
    "this phenomenon comes about already because of the alteration of the dispersion relation for the sound waves .",
    "it has been studied in various field theoretic models , however none are fully satisfactory since the unphysical short distance behavior of the field is always eventually called into play .",
    "the model that most closely mirrors the fluid analogy is a falling lattice@xcite which has sensible short distance physics .",
    "the mode conversion on the lattice involves what is known as a bloch oscillation in the condensed matter context . here",
    "i will briefly explain how it works .",
    "the model is 2d field theory on a lattice of points falling freely into a black hole .",
    "we begin with the line element in gaussian normal coordinates , ds^2 = dt^2 -a^2(t , z ) dz^2 .",
    "a line of constant @xmath418 is an infalling geodesic , at rest at infinity , and the  local scale factor \" @xmath419 satisfies a(t , z)&=&1 + a(0,z)&=&1 + a(t , z_h(t))&~&t t1 , expressing the facts that the metric is asymptotically flat , the coordinate @xmath418 measures proper distance on the @xmath420 time slice , and at the horizon @xmath421 the time scale for variations of the local scale factor is the surface gravity @xmath24 .",
    "the specific form of @xmath419 is not required for the present discussion .",
    "( for details see @xcite . ) a scalar field on this spacetime is governed by the action s&=&d^2x g^ _ _ + & = & dt dz .",
    "now we discretize the @xmath418 coordinate with spacing @xmath158 : zz_m = m , _",
    "zd= , where @xmath422 . the proper distance between the lattice points @xmath423 and @xmath424 on a constant @xmath77 slice is approximately @xmath425 . at @xmath420 this is just @xmath158 everywhere , that is the points start out equidistant .",
    "however , since they are on free fall trajectories at different distances from the horizon , they spread out as time goes on .",
    "in particular the lattice spacing at the horizon grows with time like @xmath426 .",
    "the discretized action is s_lattice = dt _ m. the discrete field equations produce the dispersion relation ^ff(k)=(k/2 ) for a mode of the form @xmath427 , provided @xmath428 and @xmath429 .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ lattdr ] . )    for small wave numbers the lattice dispersion agrees with the continuum , however it is periodic in translation of @xmath167 by @xmath430 . at the wavenumber @xmath431 there is a maximum frequency @xmath432 and vanishing group velocity @xmath433 . beyond",
    "that wavenumber the group velocity reverses , and @xmath167 is equivalent to @xmath434 which lies in the brillouin zone @xmath435 .    on the lattice",
    "the trans - planckian redshift can not take place , because of the lattice cutoff .",
    "hence the outgoing modes  provided they exist  must come from ingoing modes .",
    "both wkb  eikonal \" trajectory and numerical evolution of the discrete wave equation confirm that indeed this occurs .",
    "the behavior of a typical wavepacket throughout the process of bouncing off the horizon is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ tsequence ] .",
    "the real part of the wavepacket is plotted vs. the static coordinate at several different times . following backwards in time ,",
    "the packet starts to squeeze up against the horizon and then a trailing dip freezes and develops oscillations that grow until they balloon out , forming into a compact high frequency wavepacket that propagates neatly away from the horizon backwards in time .    the mode conversion can be understood as follows , following a wavepacket peaked around a long wavelength @xmath436 backwards in time .",
    "the wavepacket blueshifts as it approaches the horizon , eventually enough for the lattice structure and therefore the curvature of the dispersion relation to be felt . at this point its group velocity begins to drop . in the wkb calculation",
    "the wavepacket motion reverses direction at a turning point outside the horizon .",
    "this occurs before its group velocity in the falling lattice frame is negative , so it is falling in at that stage because its outward velocity is not great enough to overcome the infalling of the lattice .",
    "as the wavepapcket continues backwards in time now away from the black hole its wavevector continues to grow until it goes past the edge of the brillouin zone , thus becoming an ingoing mode also in the lattice frame .",
    "this reversal of group velocity is precisely what happens in a ",
    "bloch oscillation \" when a quantum particle in a periodic potential is accelerated . as",
    "the turnaround is occuring , another equally important effect is that the time - dependence of the underlying lattice is felt .",
    "thus , unlike in the continuum limit of this stationary background , _ the killing frequency of the wavepacket is no longer conserved_.    following the wavepacket all the way backwards in time out to the asymptotic region , it winds up with a short wavelength of order @xmath158 and a large frequency of order @xmath437 .",
    "this frequency shift is absolutely critical to the existence of the outgoing modes , since an ingoing low frequency mode would simply fall across the horizon .",
    "only the  exotic \" modes with sufficiently high frequency will undergo the mode conversion process .",
    "the hawking flux is determined by the negative frequency part of the ingoing wavepacket .",
    "the eikonal approximation just described does not capture the negative frequency mixing which occurs during the turnaround at the horizon .",
    "just as in the continuum , the wavepacket squeezed against the horizon has both positive and negative free - fall frequency components . as these components propagate backwards in time away from the horizon , their frequency slowly shifts , but their relative amplitude remains fixed .",
    "hence the norm of the negative freqency part of the incoming wavepacket turns out to be just what the continuum hawking effect indicates , with small lattice corrections .",
    "put differently , the infalling vacuum is adiabatically modified by the underlying microscopic time dependence of the lattice in such a way that the unruh conditions ( [ uvacuum ] ) on the state of the outgoing modes at the horizon are satisfied .",
    "since the lattice has a short distance cutoff the entanglement entropy between the modes just inside and outside of the horizon is finite at any time . as illustrated in figure [ ancestors ] , any given entangled pair of vacuum modes began in the past outside the horizon , propagated towards the horizon where it was  split \" , and then separated , with one half falling in and the other converted into an outgoing mode .",
    "as time goes on , new pairs continually propagate in and maintain a constant entanglement entropy .      as discussed in section [ stim ] ,",
    "if the unruh vacuum conditions ( [ uvacuum ] ) do not hold at the horizon then stimulated emission of hawking radiation will occur . in the falling lattice model ,",
    "these horizon modes arise from ingoing modes long after the black hole formed as shown in figure [ ancestors ] .",
    "thus it is possible to stimulate the emission of hawking radiation by sending in radiation at late times , in contrast to the usual continuum case of a static black hole .",
    "this seems a generic feature of theories with a cutoff , for which the outgoing modes must arise from modes that are ingoing after the collapse .",
    "( something like it should happen also in string theory if , as many suppose , the trans - planckian reservoir at the horizon is also eliminated there . ) note however that the linear model described here is surely a gross oversimplification . turning on the gravitational interactions between the modes and the background , one is led to a picture in which the modes  dissipate \" when propagated backwards in time to the planckian regime .",
    "hence what really produces the outgoing hawking quantum must be a complicated collective mode of the interacting vacuum that  anti - dissipates \" as it approaches the horizon and turns around .",
    "calculations exploring this in quantum gravity were carried out in @xcite .",
    "the microscopic time dependence of the lattice , i.e. the slow spreading of the lattice points , plays a critical role in transforming an ingoing mode with high killing frequency to an outgoing mode with low killing frequency , and in allowing for mixing of positive and negative frequencies despite the stationarity of the continuum black hole background .",
    "this suggests the conjecture that in quantum gravity the underlying quantum fluctuations of the geometry that do not share the stationarity of the black hole background metric might play this role .",
    "a step towards understanding this might be provided by a two or three dimensional version of the lattice model , in which the density of lattice points remains fixed but their microscopic positions fluctuate .",
    "this is precisely what happens with an inhomogeneous flow of a real molecular fluid .",
    "the quantum gravity analysis of @xcite lends some support to this conjecture , though it is not clear whether the lorentz violation seen there is just an artifact of a non - covariant cutoff or a feature introduced by the global geometry of the black hole spacetime .",
    "the modes producing the inflationary perturbation spectrum ( _ cf . _ section [ primalpert ] ) redshift exponentially from their trans - planckian origins .",
    "it has been suggested that this might leave a visible imprint on the perturbation spectrum , via a modified high frequency dispersion relation and/or a modified initial quantum state for the field modes .",
    "as illustrated by the hawking process on the lattice however , as long as the redshifting is adiabatic on the timescale of the modes , they would remain in their ground states .",
    "if the hubble rate @xmath85 during inflation were much less than the planck mass @xmath438 ( or whatever scale the modified dispersion sets in ) the modes could be treated in the standard relativistic manner by the time the perturbation spectrum is determined . at most one might expect an effect of order @xmath439 , and some analyses suggest the effect will be even smaller .",
    "this all depends on what _ state _ the modes are in",
    ". they can not be too far from the vacuum , since otherwise running them backwards in time they would develop an exponentially growing energy density which would be incompatible with the inflationary dynamics .",
    "hence it seems the best one can say at present is that there may be room for noticable deviations from the inflationary predictions , if @xmath439 is large enough .",
