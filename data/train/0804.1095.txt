    "the mathematics of peg jumping originated in the games of peg solitaire and conway s soldiers ( see berlekamp , conway , and guy  @xcite ) .",
    "much has been written about answering the classical questions of peg solitaire and conway s soldiers in more general settings ( see , for example , eriksen , eriksson , and eriksson  @xcite ) . in this paper , however , we consider peg jumping  or , as we call it , pegging  on graphs , and our questions are inspired by work in the theory of graph pebbling",
    ".    given a graph , we view each vertex as a hole into which one peg can be placed . a _ pegging move _ consists of removing two pegs from adjacent holes and placing one peg in a third , empty hole adjacent to one of the first two holes .",
    "in essence , one peg is jumping the other and landing in the third hole ( with the jumped peg being removed ) .",
    "if there are pegs in some of the vertices of the graph , we say that we can _ peg to a vertex _ if we can move a peg to that vertex with a ( possibly empty ) sequence of pegging moves .",
    "conway s soldiers can be recast in this general setting . in that game ,",
    "the graph in question is embedded in the cartesian plane with vertex set @xmath0 , and there is an edge between two vertices if their euclidean distance is 1 .",
    "pegs are placed at all vertices in the lower half - plane , and the challenge is to move a peg as far as possible into the upper half - plane by peg - jumping .",
    "classically , however , a peg is only allowed to jump in a straight line ( horizontally or vertically ) over another peg , which is more restrictive than our pegging moves .",
    "in fact , whether or not all pegging moves are allowed , the best possible solution moves a peg up four units .",
    "this was proved in the classical case by conway using a weight argument ; our results on graphs use an extension of that weight argument and incidentally show that the optimum solution to conway s soldiers can not be improved upon using pegging moves .",
    "as mentioned , the pegging questions we consider are motivated by graph pebbling ( see hurlbert  @xcite for a survey of graph pebbling ) .",
    "the _ pegging number _ of a graph is the minimum number of pegs so that no matter how those pegs are distributed on the graph , we can peg to any vertex . in contrast",
    ", the _ optimal pegging number _ of the graph is the minimum number of pegs so that there is _ some _ way to distribute those pegs on the graph so that we can peg to any vertex .",
    "these definitions mirror those of the pebbling number and the optimal pebbling number of a graph .",
    "in fact , we will use results on pebbling numbers to prove results on pegging numbers ; basic pebbling definitions will be given when needed .",
    "a formal definition of pegging and fundamental pegging lemmas appear in section  [ s : basic ] . in section  [",
    "s : classes ] , we study the pegging numbers of several classes of graphs , including paths and cycles . in section  [",
    "s : prod ] , we move on to the cartesian product of an arbitrary graph @xmath1 with a complete graph @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , theorem  [ t : crosskn ] relates the pegging number of @xmath3 to the pebbling number of @xmath1 . in section  [ s : hypercube ] , we apply this result to compute the pegging number of the hypercube , and we also obtain upper and lower bounds for the optimal pegging number of the hypercube ; this uses the theory of binary linear codes .",
    "finally , in section  [ s : diameter ] , we give an upper bound for the optimal pegging number of a graph of diameter @xmath4 , classify graphs with pegging number at most 3 , and give an upper bound for the pegging number of a graph of diameter at most @xmath5 .    the concept of pegging on a graph",
    "was introduced by the third author at the 1994 university of minnesota duluth research experience for undergraduates ( reu ) .",
    "he and several of the students at the program spent a weekend exploring basic properties of pegging .",
    "their results are included here , along with our later work .",
    "further work on pegging has been done by wood  @xcite and levavi  @xcite .",
    "it should also be mentioned that niculescu and niculescu  @xcite independently proposed the idea of pegging on graphs ; however , their only result in that direction is the first conclusion of lemma  [ l : mon weight ] .",

    "the set @xmath14 is the _ source _ of @xmath13 , and the vertex @xmath10 is the _ destination _ of @xmath13 . if @xmath15 is a sequence of pegging moves starting at @xmath6 , then we write @xmath16 for the final distribution .",

    "the _ reach _ of a distribution @xmath6 , denoted @xmath19 , is the set of all vertices reachable from @xmath6 .",

    "if no connected component of @xmath1 is isomorphic to a star graph @xmath49 , then @xmath50 , with equality if and only if there are two adjacent vertices that dominate @xmath1 .",

    "on the other hand , theorem  [ t : reach ] shows that allowing stacking and pebbling moves does not help reach additional targets in pegging .",
    "thus , because in peggling the starting configuration can be any multi - distribution , the peggling number of a graph is at least its pegging number , and the optimal peggling number of a graph is at most its optimal pegging number .",
    "all of these inequalities may be strict ; for example the graph @xmath406 has pebbling number @xmath532 , pegging number @xmath5 , and peggling number @xmath347 ; and the graph obtained by adding a pendant edge to each leaf of @xmath333 has optimal pebbling number @xmath162 , optimal pegging number @xmath162 , and optimal peggling number @xmath5 .",
