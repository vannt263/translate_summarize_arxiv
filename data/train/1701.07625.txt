    "we consider a graph to specify the network of routes over which resources are to be redistributed .",
    "thus , throughout , the terms graph and network will be used interchangeably .",
    "network robustness is usually understood as the ability of the network to maintain connectivity or be insensitive ( as measured by observables ) in the face of link and node losses or disturbances .",
    "various notions of robustness have been put forth and studied . in particular ,",
    "robustness with respect to link and node losses has been considered as an inverse _ percolation _ process @xcite .",
    "robust network design has been used to suggest the ability to meet demands in a given _",
    "uncertainty set _ @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in @xcite , robustness has been defined through a fluctuation - dissipation relation involving the entropy rate ( kolmogorov - sinai entropy ) .",
    "this latter notion captures relaxation of a process back to equilibrium after a perturbation and has been used to study both financial and biological networks @xcite .",
    "a different issue is whether , given a network , a certain specific transport strategy , over a given finite time horizon is in some sense robust . here",
    "equilibrium or even steady state behaviour plays no role .",
    "a concept of _ resilience _ of a routing policy in the presence of cascading failures has been introduced and discussed in @xcite . in a recent paper @xcite , we studied the following robust transport problem : given times @xmath0 and a directed , strongly connected graph , find a transportation plan from a source node to a sink node such that most of the mass arrives within the prescribed time even in the presence of failures .    different from several other contributions , our approach is  global \" in that _ measures on paths _ play a central role . in @xcite ,",
    "robustness of the transportation plan was identified with the mass spreading as much as the topology of the graph permitted before reconvening at the target node .",
    "this was achieved by solving a maximum entropy problem on path space , namely a _",
    "schrdinger bridge problem _ ( sbp ) , with the so - called _ ruelle - bowen _ random walk as  prior \" distribution .",
    "this approach was then extended to weighted graphs , resulting in a transportation plan that attains a satisfactory compromise between robustness and cost .",
    "indeed , the optimal scheduling , while spreading the mass over all feasible paths , assigns _ maximum probability _ to all _ minimum cost paths_. this approach appears also computationally attractive given the iterative algorithm proposed in @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we continue this line of research by introducing an explicit index of _ efficiency _ of a transportation plan and seeking efficient - robust transport plans .",
    "moreover , we establish two remarkable _ invariance properties _ of the schrdinger s bridges .",
    "these consist in an _ iterated bridge _ invariance property and in the invariance of the _ most probable paths_. these two invariance properties , which were only briefly mentioned in @xcite in some special cases , are here fully investigated .",
    "their relevance for transport over networks is then illustrated .",
    "further , we study the dependence of the optimal transport on the temperature parameter . the possibility of employing the solution for near - zero temperature as an approximation of the solution to _ optimal mass transport _ ( omt ) is also discussed and illustrated through examples .",
    "the outline of the remainder of the paper is as follows . after recalling in section  [ gsb ] the notion of generalized schrdinger bridges ,",
    "we introduce in section  [ efficiency ] a notion of efficiency of the corresponding transport policy . in section  [ robust ] , we introduce robust transport with fixed average path length",
    ". the next two sections deal with properties of the schrdinger bridge  in section [ ib ] we establish the iterated bridge property , and in section [ mpp ] the invariance of the most probable paths . section  [ efficient - robust ] deals with efficient - robust transportation . in section  [ tdependence ] ,",
    "the dependence of the optimal transport on the temperature parameter is thoroughly investigated .",
    "the results are then illustrated through academic examples in section  [ example ] .",
    "we consider the generalization of the schrdinger bridge problem ( sbp ) introduced in @xcite . to this end",
    "we are given a directed , strongly connected ( i.e. , with a path in each direction between each pair of vertices ) , aperiodic graph @xmath1 with vertex set @xmath2 and edge set @xmath3 .",

    "the problem was considered in the context of markov chains and studied in @xcite , and some generalizations have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "important connections between sbp and omt @xcite have been discovered and developed in @xcite .",
    "inspired by the celebrated paper @xcite , we introduce below a measure of _ efficiency _ of a _ transportation plan over a certain finite time horizon and a given network_.    for the case of undirected and connected graphs , _ small - world networks _ @xcite were identified as networks being highly clustered but with small characteristic path length @xmath62 , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the shortest path length between vertices @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the inverse of the characteristic path length @xmath67 is an index of efficiency of @xmath68 .",

    "@xmath69 , instead , measures the efficiency of a parallel system , namely one in which all nodes concurrently exchange packets of information .",
    "since we are interested in the efficiency of a specific transportation plan , we define below efficiency by a suitable adaptation of the index @xmath62 .",
    "we now consider a strongly connected , aperiodic , directed graph @xmath1 as in section [ gsb ] . to each edge",
    "@xmath75 is now associated a length @xmath76 . if @xmath23 , we set @xmath77 .",
    "let @xmath4 be the time - indexing set .",
    "for a path @xmath78 , we define the length of @xmath79 to be @xmath80 we consider the situation where initially at time @xmath81 the mass is distributed on @xmath17 according to @xmath82 and needs to be distributed according to @xmath83 at the final time @xmath84 .",
    "these masses are normalized to sum to one , so that they are probability distributions . a transportation plan",
    "@xmath34 is a probability measure on the ( feasible ) paths of the network having the prescribed marginals @xmath85 and @xmath86 at the initial and final time , respectively .",
    "a natural adaptation of the characteristic path length is to consider the _ average path length of the transportation plan _ @xmath34 , which we define as @xmath87 with the usual convention @xmath88 .",
    "this is entirely analogous to a thermodynamic quantity , the _ internal energy _ , which is defined as the expected value of the hamiltonian observable in state @xmath34 .",
    "clearly , @xmath89 is finite if and only if the transport takes place on actual , existing links of @xmath68 .",
    "moreover , only the paths which are in the _ support _ of @xmath34 enter in the computation of @xmath89 .",
    "one of the goals of a transportation plan is of course to have small average path length since , for instance , cost might simply be proportional to length .",
    "determining the probability measure that minimizes can be seen to be an omt problem .",
    "besides efficiency , another desirable property of a transport strategy is to ensure robustness with respect to links / nodes failures , the latter being due possibly to malicious attacks .",
    "we therefore seek a transport plan in which the mass spreads , as much as it is allowed by the network topology , before reconvening at time @xmath84 in the sink node .",
    "we achieve this by selecting a transportation plan @xmath34 that has a suitably high entropy @xmath90 , where @xmath91 thus , in order to attain a level of robustness while guaranteeing a relatively low average path length ( cost ) , we formulate below a constrained optimization problem that weighs in both @xmath90 as well as @xmath89 .",
    "we begin by letting @xmath92 designate a suitable bound on the average path length ( cost ) that we are willing accept .",
    "we assume that @xmath92 satisfies @xmath93 the inequality to the left is clear , whereas the rationale behind the other , requiring an upper bound as stated , will be explained in proposition [ properties ] below .",
    "let @xmath94 denote the family of probability measures on @xmath36 .",
    "we consider the constrained optimization ( _ maximum entropy _ ) problem :    [ prob1 ]    [ meprob1 ] @xmath95    consider the corresponding lagrangian @xmath96 as is well known , @xcite , the maximization of @xmath97 over @xmath94 is attained by the boltzmann distribution @xmath98,\\quad z(t)=\\sum_x\\exp[-\\frac{l(x)}{t } ] ,   \\quad t=\\lambda^{-1},\\ ] ] clearly , the boltzmann distribution has support on the feasible paths @xmath11 .",
    "hence , we get a version of gibbs variational principle that the boltzmann distribution @xmath99 minimizes the _ free energy _",
    "functional @xmath100 over @xmath94 .",
    "the simplest way to establish the minimizing property of the boltzmann s distribution is to observe that @xmath101 and therefore , minimizing the free energy over @xmath94 is equivalent to :    [ prob2 ] minimize @xmath102 ,    which has the unique minimum @xmath103 .",
    "the following properties of @xmath99 are also well known , see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 2 ) .    [ properties ]",
    "the following hold :    * for @xmath104 , @xmath99 tends to @xmath105 , the uniform distribution on all feasible paths . * for @xmath106",

    "consider now @xmath85 and @xmath86 distributions on @xmath17 .",
    "these are the `` starting '' and `` ending '' concentrations of resources for which we seek a transportation plan .",

    "the bridge over a bridge over a prior \" is the same as the `` bridge over the prior , '' i.e. , iterated bridges produce the same result .",
    "it is should be observed that this result for probability distributions is not surprising since the solution is in the same _ reciprocal class _ as the prior ( namely , it has the same three times transition probability ) , cf .",
    "it could then be described as the fact that only the reciprocal class of the prior matters ; this is can be seen from schrdinger s original construction @xcite , and also ( * ? ? ?",

    "this result , however , is more general since the prior is not necessarily a probability measure .    in information",

    "a most probable path is similar to a _",

    "it follows from this estimate that the most probable path is the minimizer in a deterministic calculus of variations problem where the lagrangian is an _ onsager - machlup functional _ , see @xcite for the full story .",
    "the concept of most probable path is , of course , much less delicate in our discrete setting .",
