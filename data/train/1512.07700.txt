    "storage ( es ) devices are expected to play a significant role in the future smart grid due to their capabilities of giving more flexibility and balance to the grid by providing a back - up to the renewable energy  @xcite .",
    "es can improve the electricity management in a distribution network , reduce the electricity cost through opportunistic demand response , and improve the efficient use of energy  @xcite .",
    "the distinct features of es make it a perfect candidate to assist in residential demand response by altering the electricity demand due to the changes in the balance between supply and demand .",
    "particularly , in a residential community setting , where each household is equipped with an es , the use of es devices can significantly leverage the efficient flows of energy within the community in terms of reducing cost , decarbonization of the electricity grid , and enabling effective demand response ( dr )",
    ".    however , energy storage requires space .",
    "in particular for large consumers like shared facility controllers ( sfcs ) of large apartment buildings  @xcite , the energy requirements are very high , which consequently necessitates the actual installment of very large energy storage capacity",
    ". the investment cost of such storage can be substantial whereas due to the random usage of the facilities ( depending on the usage pattern of different residents ) some of the storage may remain unused .",
    "furthermore , the use of ess for rus is very limited for two reasons @xcite : firstly , the installation cost of es devices is very high and the costs are entirely borne by the users .",
    "secondly , the ess are mainly used to save electricity costs for the rus rather than offer any support to the local energy authorities , which further makes their use economically unattractive .",
    "hence , there is a need for solutions that will capture both the problems related to space and cost constraints of storage for sfcs and the benefit to rus for supporting third parties .    to this end",
    ", numerous recent studies have focused on energy management systems with es devices as we will see in the next section .",
    "however , most of these studies overlook the potential benefits that local energy authorities such as sfcs can attain by jointly sharing the es devices belonging to the rus . particularly due to recent cost reduction of small - scale es devices , sharing of es devices installed in the rus by the sfcs",
    "has the potential to benefit both the sfcs and the rus of the community as we will see later . in this context",
    ", we propose a scheme that enables joint es ownership in smart grid . during the sharing ,",
    "each ru leases the sfcs a fraction of its es device to use , and charges and discharges from the rest of its es capacity for its own purposes . on the contrary",
    ", each sfc exclusively uses its portion of es devices leased from the rus .",
    "this work is motivated by @xcite , in which the authors discussed the idea of joint ownership of es devices between domestic customers and local network operators , and demonstrated the potential system - wide benefits that can be obtained through such sharing . however , no policy has been developed in @xcite to determine how the fraction of battery capacity , which is shared by the network operators and the domestic users , is decided .",
    "note that , as an owner of an es device , each ru can decide whether or not to take part in the joint ownership scheme with the sfcs and what fraction of the es can be shared with the sfcs . hence , there is a need for solutions that can capture this decision making process of the rus by interacting with the sfcs of the network . in this context , we propose a joint es ownership scheme in which by participating in storage sharing with the sfcs , both the rus and sfcs benefit economically . due to the interactive nature of the problem , we are motivated to use auction theory to study this problem  @xcite .",
    "exploiting the two - way communications aspects , auction mechanisms can exchange information between users and electricity providers , meet users demands at a lower cost , and thus contribute to the economic and environmental benefits of smart grid  @xcite .",
    "in particular , 1 ) we modify the _ vickrey _ auction technique  @xcite by integrating a stackelberg game between the auctioneer and the rus and show that the modified scheme leads to a desirable joint es ownership solution for the rus and the sfcs . to do this ,",
    "we modify the auction price derived from the vickrey auction , to benefit the owner of the es , through the adaptation of the adopted game as well as keep the cost savings to the sfcs at the maximum ; 2 ) we study the attributes of the technique , and show that the proposed auction scheme possesses both the _ incentive compatibility _ and the _ individual rationality _",
    "properties leveraged by the unique equilibrium solution of the game ; 3 ) we propose an algorithm for the stackelberg game that can be executed distributedly by the rus and the auctioneer , and the algorithm is shown to be guaranteed to reach the desired solution .",
    "we also discuss how the proposed scheme can be extended to the time varying case ; and 4 ) finally , we provide numerical examples to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme .",
    "the importance and necessity of the proposed study with respect to actual operation of smart grid lies in assisting the sfcs of large apartment buildings in smart communities to reduce space requirements and investment costs of large energy storage units .",
    "furthermore , by participating in storage sharing with the sfcs , the rus can benefit economically , which can consequently influence them to efficiently schedule their appliances and thus reduce the excess use of electricity .",
    "we stress that multi - agent energy management schemes are not new in the smart grid paradigm and have been discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the scheme discussed in the paper differs from these existing approaches in terms of the considered system model , chosen methodology and analysis , and the use of the set of rules to reach the desired solution .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we provide a comprehensive literature review of the related work in section  [ sec : literature ] followed by the considered system model in section  [ sec : system - model ] .",
    "our proposed modified auction - based mechanism is demonstrated in section  [ sec : auction - ownership ] where we also discuss how the scheme can be adopted in a time varying environment .",
    "the numerical case studies are discussed in section  [ sec : case - study ] , and finally we draw some concluding remarks in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in the recent years , there has been an extensive research effort to understand the potential of es devices for residential energy management @xcite .",
    "this is mainly due to their capabilities in reducing the intermittency of renewable energy generation  @xcite as well as lowering the cost of electricity  @xcite .",
    "the related studies can be divided into two general categories .",
    "the first category of studies consisting of @xcite , which assume that the ess are installed within each ru premises and are used solely by the owners in order to perform different energy management tasks such as optimal placement , sizing and control of charging and discharging of storage devices .",
    "the second type of studies deal with es devices that are not installed within the rus but located in a different location such as in electric vehicles ( evs ) . here , the ess of evs are used to provide ancillary services for rus  @xcite and local energy providers  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , another important impact of es devices on residential distribution grids is studied in @xcite and @xcite . in particular , these studies focus on how the use of es devices can bring benefits for the stakeholders in external energy markets . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors propose a multi - objective optimization method for siting and sizing of ess of a distribution grid to capture the trade - offs between the storage stakeholders and the distribution system operators .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite , optimal storage profiles for different stakeholders such as distribution grid operators and energy traders are derived based on case studies with real data .",
    "studies of other aspects of smart grid can be found in @xcite .    as can be seen from the above discussion",
    ", the use of es devices in smart grid is not only limited to address the intermittency of renewable generation  @xcite and assisting users to take part in energy management to reduce their cost of electricity  @xcite but also extends to assisting the grid ( or , other similar energy entities such as an sfc )  @xcite and generating revenues for stakeholders  @xcite .",
    "however , one similarity between most of the above mentioned literature is that only one entity owns the es and uses it according to its requirements .",
    "nonetheless , this might not always be the case if there are large number of rus in a community . in this regard , considering the potential benefits of es sharing , as discussed in @xcite , this paper investigates the case in which the sfcs in a smart community are allowed to share some fraction of the ess owned by the rus through a third party such as an auctioneer or a community representative .",
    "the proposed modified auction scheme differs from the existing techniques for multi - agent energy management such as those in @xcite in a number of ways .",
    "particularly , in contrast to these studies , the proposed auction scheme captures the interaction between the sfcs and the rus , whereby the decision on the auction price is determined via a stackelberg game . by exploiting auction rules including the determination rule , payment rule , and allocation rule the interaction between the sfcs and rus",
    "is greatly simplified .",
    "for instance , the determination rule can easily identify the number of rus that are participating in the auction process , which further leverage the determination of the auction price via the stackelberg game in the payment rule .",
    "furthermore , on the one hand the work here complements the existing works focusing on the potential of es for energy management in smart grid . on the other hand ,",
    "the proposed work has the potential to open new research opportunities in terms of control of energy dispatch from es , the size of es , and exploring other interactive techniques such as cooperative games and bi - level optimization for es sharing .",
    "let us consider a smart community that consists of a large number of rus .",
    "each ru can be an individual home , a single unit of a large apartment complex , or a large number of units connected via an aggregator that acts as a single entity  @xcite .",
    "each ru is equipped with an es device that the ru can use to store electricity from the main grid or its renewable energy sources , if there are any , or can perform dr management according to the real - time price offered by the grid .",
    "the es device can be a storage device installed within each ru premises or can be the es used for the ru s electric vehicles .",
    "the entire community is considered to be divided into a number of blocks , where each block consists of a number of rus and an sfc .",
    "each sfc @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the set of all sfcs and @xmath2 , is responsible for controlling the electrical equipment and machines such as lifts , parking lot lights and gates , water pumps , and lights in the corridor area of a particular block of the community , which are shared and used by the residents of that block on regular basis .",
    "each sfc is assumed to have its own renewable energy generation and is also connected to the main electricity grid with appropriate communication protocols .",
    "is willing to share with the sfcs of the community . ]",
    "considering the fact that the nature of energy generation and consumption is highly sporadic  @xcite , let us assume that the sfcs in the community need some extra ess to store their electricity after meeting the demand of their respected shared facilities at a particular time of the day .",
    "this can be either due to the fact that some sfcs do not have their own ess  @xcite or that the ess of the sfcs are not large enough to store all the excess energy at that time .",
    "it is important to note that the es requirement of the sfcs can stem from any type of intermittent generation profile that the sfcs or rus can adopt .",
    "for example , one can consider that the proposed scheme is based on a hybrid generation profile comprising both solar and wind generation .",
    "however , the proposed technique is equally suitable for other types of intermittent generation as well .",
    "we assume that there are @xmath3 rus , where @xmath4 is the set of all rus in the system , that are willing to share some parts of their es with the sfcs of the network .",
    "the battery capacity of each ru @xmath5 is @xmath6 , and each ru @xmath7 wants to put @xmath8 fraction of its es in the market to share with the sfcs , where @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is the maximum amount of battery space that the ru can share with the sfcs if the cost - benefit tradeoff for the sharing is attractive for it . @xmath11 is the amount of es that the ru does not want to share , rather uses for its own needs , e.g. , to run the essential loads in the future if there is any electricity disruption within the ru or if the price of electricity is very high .    to this end , to offer an es space @xmath8 , on the one hand , each ru @xmath7 decides on an reservation price @xmath12 per unit of energy .",
    "hereinafter , we will use es space and energy interchangeably to refer to the es space that each ru might share with the sfcs .",
    "however , if the price @xmath13 , which each ru received for sharing its es , is lower than @xmath12 , the ru @xmath7 removes its es space @xmath8 from the market as the expected benefit from the joint sharing of es is not economically attractive for it . on the other hand ,",
    "each sfc @xmath0 , that needs to share es space with the rus to store their energy , decides a reservation bid @xmath14 , which represents the maximum unit price the sfc @xmath15 is willing to pay for sharing per unit of es with the rus in the smart community , to enter into the sharing market . and , if @xmath16 , the sfc removes its commitment of joint es ownership with rus from the market due to the same reason as mentioned for the ru . a graphical representation of the concept of es sharing and their decision making process of sharing the es space of each ru @xmath7 with the sfcs",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : batteryshare ]",
    ". please note that to keep the formulation simple , we do not include any specific storage model in the scheme .",
    "however , by suitably modeling some related parameters such as the storage capacity @xmath6 , and parameters like @xmath11 and @xmath10 , the proposed scheme can be adopted for specific es devices .",
    "the interaction that arises from the choice of es sharing price between the sfcs and rus as well as the need of the sfcs to share the es space to store their energy and the profits that the rus can reap from allowing their ess to be shared give rise to a market of es sharing between the rus and the sfcs in the smart grid . in this market , the involved @xmath17 rus and @xmath18 sfcs will interact with each other to decide as to how many of them will take part in sharing the ess between themselves , and also to agree on the es sharing parameters such as the trading price @xmath13 and the amount of es space to be shared . in the considered model , the rus not only decide on the reservation prices @xmath12 , but also on the amount of es space @xmath8 that they are willing to share with the sfcs .",
    "the amount of @xmath8 is determined by the trade - off between between the economic benefits that the ru @xmath7 expects to obtain from giving the sfcs the joint ownership of its es device and the associated reluctance @xmath19 of the ru for such sharing .",
    "the reluctance to share ess may arise from the rus due to many factors .",
    "for instance , sharing would enable frequent charging and discharging of ess that reduce the lifespan of an es device  @xcite .",
    "hence , an ru @xmath7 may set its @xmath19 higher so as to increase its reluctance to participate in the es sharing .",
    "however , if the ru is more interested in earning revenue rather than increasing es life time , it can reduce its @xmath19 and thus get more net benefits from sharing its storage .",
    "therefore , for a given set of bids @xmath20 and storage requirement @xmath21 by the sfcs , the maximum amount of es @xmath8 that each ru @xmath7 will decide to put for sharing is strongly affected by the trading price @xmath13 and the reluctance parameter @xmath19 of each ru @xmath5 during the sharing process . in this context",
    ", we develop an auction based joint es ownership scheme in the next section .",
    "we understand that the proposed scheme involves different types of users such as auctioneers , sfcs , and rus .",
    "therefore , the communication protocol used by them could be asynchronous .",
    "however , in our study we assume that the communication between different entities of the system are synchronous .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that we assume our algorithm is executed once in a considered time slot , and the duration of this time slot can be one hour @xcite .",
    "therefore , synchronization is not a significant issue for the considered case and the communication complexity is affordable . for example , the auctioneer can wait for five minutes until it receives all the data from sfcs and the rus and then the algorithm , which is proposed in section  [ sec : algorithm ] , can be executed .",
    "vickrey auction is a type of sealed - bid auction scheme , where the bidders submit their written bids to the auctioneer without knowing the bids of others participating in the auction  @xcite .",
    "the highest bidder wins the auction but pays the _ second highest _ bid price . nevertheless ,",
    "in this paper , we modify the classical vickrey auction  @xcite to model the joint es ownership scheme for a smart community consisting of multiple customers ( i.e. , the sfcs ) and multiple owners of es devices ( i.e. , the rus ) .",
    "the modification is motivated by the following factors : 1 ) unlike the classical vickrey auction , the modified scheme would enable the multiple owners and customers to decide simultaneously and independently whether to take part in the joint es sharing through the determination rule of the proposed auction process , as we will see shortly ; 2 ) the modification of the auction provides each participating ru @xmath7 with flexibility of choosing the amount of es space that they may want to share with the sfcs in cases when the auction price will be used to refer to auction price instead of sharing or trading price . ]",
    "@xmath13 is lower than their expected reservation price @xmath12 ; and 3 ) finally , the proposed auction scheme provides solutions that satisfy both the _ incentive compatibility _ and _ individual rationality _",
    "properties , as we will see later , which are desirable in any mechanism that adopts auction theory  @xcite .    to this end , the proposed auction process , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : system_model ] , consists of three elements :    1 .",
    "owner : the rus in set @xmath4 , that own the es devices , and expect to earn some economic benefits , e.g. , through maximizing a utility function , by letting the sfcs to share some fraction of their es spaces .",
    "2 .   customer : the sfcs in set @xmath1 , that are in need of ess in order to store some excess electricity at a particular time of the day .",
    "the sfcs offer the rus a price with a view to jointly own some fraction of their es devices .",
    "3 .   auctioneer : a third party ( e.g. , estate or building manager ) , that controls the auction process between the owners and the customers according to some predefined rules .",
    "the proposed auction policies consist of a ) determination rule , b ) payment rule and c ) storage allocation rule . here , _ determination rule _",
    "allows the auctioneer to determine the maximum limit for the auction price @xmath22 and the number of sfcs and rus that will actively take part in the es sharing scheme once the auction process is initiated .",
    "the _ payment rule _ enables the auctioneer to decide on the price that the customer needs to pay to the owners for sharing their es devices , which allows the rus to decide how much storage space they will be putting into the market to share with the sfcs .",
    "finally , the auctioneer allocates the es spaces for sharing for each sfc following the _ allocation rule _ of the proposed auction .",
    "it is important to note that although both the customers and owners do not have any access to others private information such as the amount of es to be shared by an ru or the required energy space by any sfc , the rules of auction are known to all the participants of the joint ownership process .",
    "the proposed scheme initially determines the set of sfcs @xmath23 and rus @xmath24 that will effectively take part in the auction mechanism once the upper bound of the auction price @xmath22 is determined .",
    "eventually , the payment and the allocation rules are executed in the course of the auction plan .",
    "the determination rule of the proposed scheme is executed by the following steps ( inspired from  @xcite ) :    a.   the rus of set @xmath4 , i.e. , the owners of the ess , declare their reservation price @xmath25 in an increasing order , which we can consider , without loss of generality , as : @xmath26 the rus submit the reservation price along with the amount @xmath8 of es that they are interested to share with the sfcs to the auctioneer .",
    "b.   the sfcs bidding prices , i.e. , @xmath20 , are arranged in a decreasing order , i.e. , @xmath27 the sfcs submit to the auctioneer along with the quantity @xmath28 of es that they require .",
    "once the auctioneer receives the ordered information from the rus and the sfcs , it generates the aggregated supply ( reservation price of the rus versus the amount of es the rus interested to share ) and demand curves ( reservation bids @xmath14 verses the quantity of es @xmath29 needed ) using and respectively .",
    "d.   the auctioneer determines the number of of participating sfcs @xmath30 and rus @xmath31 that satisfies @xmath32 from the intersection of the two curves using any standard numerical method @xcite .",
    "as soon as the sfc @xmath33 and ru @xmath34 are determined from the intersection point , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : doubleauction ] , an important aspect of the auction mechanism is to determine the number of sfcs and rus , which will take part in the joint ownership of ess .",
    "we note that once the number of sfcs @xmath30 and rus @xmath31 are determined , the following relationship holds for the rest of the sfcs and rus in the network : @xmath35 hence , the joint ownership of es would be a detrimental choice for the rus and the sfcs within the set @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively , which consequently remove them from the proposed auction process .",
    "now , one desirable property of any auction mechanism is that no participating agents in the auction mechanism will cheat once the payment and allocation rules are being established . to this end",
    ", we propose that , once @xmath31 and @xmath30 are determined , @xmath38 sfcs and @xmath39 rus will be engaged in the joint es sharing process , which is a necessary condition for matching total demand and supply while maintaining a truthful auction scheme  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , if truthful auction is not a necessity , sfc @xmath30 and ru @xmath31 can also be allowed to participate in the joint es ownership auction .",
    "we note that the intersection of the demand and supply curves demonstrates the highest reservation price @xmath22 for the participating @xmath39 rus .",
    "according to the _ vickrey _ auction mechanism  @xcite , the auction price for sharing the es devices would be the second highest reservation price , i.e. , the vickrey price , which will be indicated as @xmath40 hereinafter .",
    "however , we note that this second highest price might not be considerably beneficial for all the participating rus in the auction scheme . in contrast , if @xmath13 is set to @xmath41 , the price could be detrimental for some of the sfcs .",
    "therefore , to make the auction scheme attractive and beneficial to all the participating rus and , at the same time , to be cost effective for all the sfcs , we strike a balance between the @xmath22 and @xmath40 . to do so , we propose a scheme for deciding on both the auction price @xmath13 and the amount of ess @xmath8 that rus will put into the market for sharing according to @xmath13 . in particular , we propose a stackelberg game between the auctioneer that decides on the auction price @xmath13 to maximize the average cost savings to the sfcs as well as satisfying their desirable needs of ess , and the rus , that decide on the vector of the amount of es @xmath42 $ ] that they would like to put into the market for sharing such that their benefits are maximized .",
    "please note that the solution of the proposed problem formulation can also be solved following other distributed algorithms , e.g. , algorithms designed via the bi - level optimization technique  @xcite .",
    "_ stackelberg game _ : stackelberg game is a multi - level decision making process , in which the leader of the game takes the first step to choose its strategy .",
    "the followers , on the other hand , choose their strategy in response to the decision made by the leader .",
    "in the proposed game , we assume the auctioneer as the leader and the rus as the followers .",
    "hence , it can be seen as a single - leader - multiple - follower stackelberg game ( slmfsg ) .",
    "we propose that the auctioneer , as a leader of the slmfsg @xmath43 , will take the first step to choose a suitable auction price @xmath13 from the range @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "meanwhile , each ru @xmath45 , as a follower of the game , will play its best strategy by choosing a suitable @xmath46",
    "$ ] in response to the price @xmath13 offered by the auctioneer .",
    "the best response strategy of each ru @xmath7 will stem from a utility function @xmath47 , which captures the benefit that an ru @xmath7 can gain from deciding on the amount of es @xmath8 to be shared for the offered price . whereas the auctioneer chooses the price @xmath13 with a view to maximize the average cost savings @xmath48 of the sfcs in the network . now to capture the interaction between the auctioneer and the rus , we formally define the slmfsg @xmath43 as @xmath49 which consists of : i ) the set of rus @xmath50 participating in the auction scheme and the auctioneer ; ii ) the utility @xmath47 that each ru @xmath7 reaps from choosing a suitable strategy @xmath8 in response to the price @xmath13 announce by the auctioneer ; iii ) the strategy set @xmath51 of each ru @xmath52 ; iv ) the _ average _ cost savings @xmath48 that incurred to each sfc @xmath53 from the strategy chosen by the auctioneer , and v ) the strategy @xmath54 $ ] of the auctioneer .",
    "now , the utility function @xmath47 , which defines the benefits that an ru @xmath7 can attain from sharing @xmath8 amount of its es with the sfcs , is proposed to be @xmath55 where , @xmath19 is the reluctant parameter of ru @xmath7 , and @xmath12 is the reservation price set by ru @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath47 mainly consists of two parts .",
    "the first part @xmath56 is the utility in terms of its revenue that an ru @xmath7 obtains from sharing its @xmath8 portion of es device .",
    "the second part @xmath57 , on other hand , is the negative impact in terms of liability on the ru @xmath7 stemming from sharing its es with the sfc .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that once an ru decides to share its @xmath8 amount of storage space with an sfc , the ru can only use @xmath58 amount of storage for its own use .",
    "the term @xmath57 captures this restriction of the ru on the usage of its own es . in",
    ", the reluctance parameter @xmath19 is introduced as a _ design parameter _ to measure the degree of unwillingness of an ru to take part in energy sharing . in particular",
    ", a higher value of @xmath19 refers to the case when an ru @xmath7 is more reluctant to take part in the es sharing , and thus , as can be seen from , even with the same es sharing attains a lower net benefit .",
    "thus , @xmath47 can be seen as a net benefit to ru @xmath7 for sharing its es .",
    "the utility function is based on the assumption of a non - decreasing marginal utility , which is suitable for modeling the benefits of power consumers , as explained in  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the proposed utility function also possesses the following properties : i ) the utility of any ru increases as the amount of price @xmath13 paid to it for sharing per unit of es increases ; ii ) as the reluctance parameter @xmath19 increases , the ru @xmath7 becomes more reluctant to share its es , and consequently the utility decreases ; and iii ) for a particular price @xmath13 , the more an ru shares with the sfcs , the less interested it becomes to share more for the joint ownership . to that end , for a particular price @xmath13 and reluctance parameter @xmath19 , the objective of ru @xmath7 is @xmath59,~x_i\\leq b_i.\\label{eqn : obj - ru}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the proposed approach , each ru @xmath7 iteratively responses to the strategy @xmath13 chosen by the auctioneer independent of other rus in set @xmath60 .",
    "the response of @xmath7 is affected by the offered price @xmath13 , its reluctance parameter @xmath19 and the initial reservation price @xmath12 .",
    "however , we note that the auctioneer does not have any control over the decision making process of the rus .",
    "it only sets the auction price @xmath13 with a view to maximize the cost savings @xmath48 , with respect to the cost with the initial bidding price , for the sfcs . to this end , the target of auctioneer",
    "is assumed to maximize the average cost savings @xmath61 by choosing an appropriate price @xmath13 to offer to each ru from the range @xmath62 $ ] . here",
    ", @xmath63 is the average saving in auction price that the sfcs pay to the rus for sharing the ess and @xmath64 is the total amount of es that all the sfcs share from the rus . from @xmath48",
    ", we note that the cost savings will be more if @xmath13 is lower for all @xmath53 .",
    "however , this is conflicted by that fact that a lower @xmath13 may lead to the choice of lower @xmath65 by the rus , which in turn will affect the cost to the sfcs .",
    "hence , to reach a desirable solution set @xmath66 , the auctioneer and the rus continue to interact with each other until the game reaches a stackelberg equilibrium ( se ) .",
    "let us consider the game @xmath43 as described in , where the utility of each ru @xmath7 and the average utility per sfc are described via @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively .",
    "now , @xmath43 will reach a se @xmath66 , if and only if the solution of the game satisfies the following set of conditions : @xmath67,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath68 where @xmath69 $ ] .",
    "hence , according to and , both the rus and the sfcs achieve their best possible outcomes at the se .",
    "hence , neither the rus nor the auctioneer will have any incentive to change their strategies as soon as the game @xmath43 reaches the se .",
    "however , achieving an equilibrium solution in pure strategies is not always guaranteed in non - cooperative games  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we need to investigate whether the proposed @xmath43 possesses an se or not .    there always exists a unique se solution for the proposed slmfsg @xmath43 between the auctioneer and the participating rus in set @xmath50 .",
    "[ theorem:1 ]    firstly , we note that the strategy set of the auctioneer is non - empty and continuous within the range @xmath70 $ ] .",
    "hence , there will always be a non - empty strategy for the auctioneer that will enable the rus to offer some part of their es , within their limits , to the sfcs .",

    "for similar settings , the reduction of average utility for the sfcs are @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 at @xmath174 and @xmath112 respectively . therefore , the proposed scheme will enable the rus to put more storage in the auction market if the related reluctance for this sharing is small .",
    "note that although the current investment cost of batteries is very high compared to their relative short life times , it is expected that battery costs will go down in the near future @xcite and become very popular for addressing intermittency of renewables @xcite .",

    "we investigate how the average utility of each ru is altered as the total storage amount required by the sfcs changes from in the network . for this particular case ,",
    "the considered total es requirement of the sfcs is assumed to be @xmath176 and @xmath177 . in general , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : utilityvsbuyamount ] , the average utility of each ru initially increases with the increase required by the sfcs and eventually becomes saturated to a stable value .",
    "this is due to the fact that as the required amount of es increases , the ru can share more of its reserved es that it put into the market with the sfcs with the determined auction price from the slmfsg .",
    "hence , its utility increases .",
    "however , each ru has a particular fixed es amount that it puts into the market to share .",

    "[ fig : utilityvsbuyamount ] , we understand that , if the total required es is smaller , rus with higher reluctance benefit more and vice versa .",
    "this illustrates the fact that even rus with high unwillingness to share their ess can be beneficial for sfcs of the system if their required ess are small .",
    "however , for a higher requirement , sfcs would benefit more from having rus with lower reluctances as they will be interested in sharing more to achieve higher average utilities .",
    "now , we discuss the computational complexity of the proposed scheme , which is greatly reduced by the determination rule of the modified auction scheme as this rule determines the actual number of participating rus and sfcs in the auction .",
    "we also note that after determining the number of participating sfcs and rus , the auctioneer iteratively interacts with each of the rus and sets the auction price with a view to increase the average savings for the sfc .",

    "we assume that if the shared es amount exceeds the total amount of reservation storage that an ru puts into the market , the ru will share its full reservation amount . in fit , which is a popular scheme for energy trading between consumers and the grid ,",
    "we assume that each ru prefers to sell the same storage amount of energy to the grid at an fit price rate , e.g. , @xmath179 cents / kwh  @xcite instead of sharing the same fraction of storage with the sfc . to this end",
    ", the resulting average utilities that each ru can achieve from sharing its es space with the sfcs by adopting the proposed , ed , and fit schemes are shown in table  [ table:2 ] .    from table",
    "[ table:2 ] , first we note that as the amount of required es by the sfcs increases the average utility achieved per ru also increases for all the cases . the reason for this increment is explained in fig .",

    "however , the improvement is relatively less significant as the es requirement switches from @xmath182 to @xmath183 .",
    "this change in performance can be explained as follows :    in the proposed scheme , as we have seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : utilityvsbuyamount ] , the amount of es shared by each participating ru is influenced by their reluctance parameters .",
    "hence , even the demand of the sfcs could be larger , the rus may choose not to share more of their es spaces once their reluctance is limited .",
    "in this regard , the rus in the current case study increase their share of es as the requirement by the sfcs increases , which in turn produces higher revenue for the rus .",
    "furthermore , once the rus choice of ess reach the saturation , the increase in demand , i.e. , from @xmath180 to @xmath181 in this case , does not affect their share . as a consequence ,",
    "their performance improvement is not as noticeable as the previous four cases .",
    "nonetheless , for all the considered cases , the auction process performs superior to the ed scheme with an average performance improvement of @xmath184 , which clearly shows the value of the proposed methodology to adopt joint es sharing in smart grid .",
    "the performance improvement with respect to the fit scheme , which is @xmath185 on average , is due to the difference between the determined auction price and the price per unit of energy for the fit scheme .    .",
    "]    finally , we show how the decision making process of each ru in the system is affected by its decision in the previous time slot and the total storage requirement by the sfcs .",
    "the total number of time slots that are considered to show this performance analysis is four . in this context",
    ", we assume that there are five rus in the system with es of @xmath186 and @xmath180 kwh respectively to share with the sfcs",
    ". the total es requirements of the sfcs for considered four time slot are @xmath187 , and 100 .",
    "please note that these numbers are considered for this case study only and may have different values for different scenarios .",
    "now , in fig .",
    "[ fig : time - varying ] , we show the available es to each of the rus at the begining of each time slot and how much they are going to share if the modified auction scheme is adopted in each time slot . for a simple analysis",
    ", we assume that once an ru shares its total available es , it can not share its es for the remaining of the time slots .",
    "the reservation prices are considered to change from one time to the next based on a predefined time of use price scheme . now , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : time - varying ] , in time slot @xmath112 , ru1 and ru2 share all their available ess with the sfc , whereby other rus do not share their ess due to the reasons explained in fig .  [",
    "fig : convergence ] . since , the total requirement is @xmath188 , therefore neither of ru1 and ru2 needs to carry any burden . in time",
    "slot @xmath156 , only ru3 shares its ess of @xmath189 to meet the requirement . as the sfc s requirement is lower than the supply , ru3 needs to carry a burden of @xmath190 kwh .",
    "similarly , in time slot @xmath156 and @xmath157 , all of ru3 , ru4 and ru5 take part in the energy auction scheme as they have enough es to share with the sfc .",
    "however , the es to share in time slot @xmath157 stems from the burden of oversupply from time slot @xmath156 .",
    "the scheme is not shown for more than time slot @xmath157 as the available es from all rus is already shared by the sfcs by the end of time slot @xmath157 .",
    "thus , the proposed modified auction scheme can successfully capture the time variation if the scheme is modified as given in section  [ sec : time - varying ] .",
    "in this paper , we have modeled a modified auction based joint energy storage ownership scheme between a number of residential units ( rus ) and shared facility controllers ( sfcs ) in smart grid .",
    "we have designed a system and discussed the determination , payment and allocation rule of the auction , where the payment rule of this scheme is facilitated by a single - leader - multiple - follower stackelberg game ( slmfsg ) between the auctioneer and the rus .",
    "the properties of the auction scheme and the slmfsg have been studied , and it has been shown that the proposed auction possesses the _ individual rationality _ and the _ incentive compatibility _ properties leveraged by the unique stackeberg equilibrium of the slmfsg .",
    "we have proposed an algorithm for the slmfsg , which has been shown to be guaranteed to reach the se and that also facilitates the auctioneer and the rus to decide on the auction price as well as the amount of es to be put into the market for joint ownership .",
    "a compelling extension of the proposed scheme would be to study of the feasibility of scheduling of loads such as lifts and water machines in shared space .",
    "another interesting research direction would be to determine how a very large number of sfcs or rus with different reservation and bidding prices can take part in such a modified auction scheme .",
    "one potential way to look at this problem can be from a cooperative game - theoretic point - of - view in which the sfcs and rus may cooperate to decide on the amount of reservation es and bidding price they would like to put into the market so as to participate in the auction and benefit from sharing .",
    "another very important , yet interesting , extension of this work would be to investigate how to quantify the reluctance of each ru to participate in the es sharing .",
    "such quantification of reluctance ( or , convenience ) will also enable the practical deployment of many energy management schemes already described in the literature .",
