    "in the last years the physics of quasi - one - dimensional compounds has been the object of intense theoretical and experimental investigations . in this work",
    "we study the ground state ( gs ) and magnetic excitations of two bipartite chains motivated by low - dimensional inorganic @xcite and organic @xcite ferrimagnets : the @xmath1 chain in fig . [ fsmhei](a ) and the @xmath2 chain in fig .",
    "[ fsmhei](b ) , respectively .",
    "we shall use the simplest approach for interacting electron systems on a lattice with @xmath3 sites , namely the one - band hubbard model ( hm ) : @xmath4 where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for electrons with spin @xmath7 at site @xmath8 ; @xmath9 is the hopping parameter and @xmath0 is the on site coulomb repulsion . for the extremely localized regime ( @xmath10 ) and",
    "@xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the number of particles , the hm can be mapped onto the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model ( ahm ) @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 . we should mention that macdo et al .",
    "@xcite , using a variety of numerical methods , have derived the ferrimagnetic nature of @xmath1 chains modeled by the hm in the strong and weak coupling regimes .",
    "here we focus on the half - filled band case ( @xmath15 ) and extend these previous studies to much larger systems using lanczos exact diagonalization technique .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the two lattices present three electronic bands in the tight - binding limit ( @xmath16 ) : one flat band at @xmath17 for the two chains ; and two dispersive ones , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ^ 2}$ ] , with @xmath20 and @xmath21 for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 chains , respectively .",
    "the flat band is closely associated with ferrimagnetic properties of both chains at half - filling @xcite .",
    "a particular feature of the @xmath1 chain is a local invariance under the exchange of the @xmath22 sites in any cell @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues of the exchange operator being @xmath24 .",
    "this symmetry leads to a conserved local spatial parity that in the heisenberg limit asserts that the @xmath22 sites form either a singlet ( @xmath25 ) or a triplet ( @xmath26 ) bond state .",
    "therefore for the symmetry sector in which all @xmath26 the spectrum is identical to that of the alternating spin-@xmath27/spin-@xmath28 ahm chain @xcite .",
    "a theorem due to lieb and mattis @xcite asserts that the gs of the ahm on a bipartite lattice has total spin @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the number of lattice sites at the sub - lattices @xmath28 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "so , if @xmath33 the system display unsaturated ferromagnetic ( f ) gs . the coexistence of both f and antiferromagnetic ( af ) long - range order implies in ferrimagnetism , as rigorously proved by tian @xcite .",
    "another crucial step was provided by lieb @xcite , who proved that the gs of the hm for @xmath15 has @xmath29 for any @xmath34 . in this case ,",
    "tian and collaborators @xcite further established the ferrimagnetic ( ferri ) long - range order of the gs if @xmath33 .",
    "the unit cell of the two chains of interest has @xmath32 sites in one sublattice and @xmath28 in the other ( see fig .",
    "[ fsmhei ] ) , so that @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the number of unit cells . however , although ferrimagnetism is expected , the specific magnetic structure of a unit cell may strongly depend on the coulomb coupling , as well as on quantum fluctuations , and is not known _ a priori _ from the more general results of the theorems stated above .",
    "we can probe the magnetic order through the magnetic structure factor ( msf ) : @xmath37 which is related to the zero - field static magnetic susceptibility by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath40 is the temperature .",
    "the condition for a f ( af ) ordered state is that @xmath41\\sim n$ ] , so that in a long - range ferri gs the two conditions must be fulfilled .",

    "systems with a ferri gs naturally have f ( lowering the gs spin ) and af ( rising the gs spin ) magnons as their elementary magnetic excitations .",
    "the two chains have three spin wave branches : an af mode , defined as @xmath83 ; and two f ones , derived from @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the gs energy and @xmath86 are lowest excitation energies in the sector @xmath87 , with @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",

    "[ enq](a ) , and the other modes are dispersive .",

    ". however , both lswt and mean field ( mf ) theory @xcite predicts @xmath94 , deviating from our estimated exact diagonalization value : @xmath95 , which is in excelent agreement with numerical and analytical calculations for the spin-@xmath27/spin-@xmath28 chain @xcite . on the other hand ,",

    "[ enq](b ) the level repulsion between the f branches , which in this case have the same symmetry .",
