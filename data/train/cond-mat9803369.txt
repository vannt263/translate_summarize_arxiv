    "there is continuing experimental evidence that the behavior of high temperature superconductors ( hts ) can be understood in terms of the @xmath0-wave pairing scenario , rather than in the conventional @xmath1-wave picture . on the other hand",
    "it is well known that the @xmath0-wave order parameter is strongly reduced by electron scattering at impurities and therefore can be formed only in clean materials .",
    "however , the condition of clean limit is not fulfilled in the vicinity of the grain boundaries or other hts interfaces even if the material is clean in the bulk .",
    "there are at least two reasons for that .",
    "the first one is that quasiparticle reflection from realistic interfaces is diffusive , thus providing the isotropisation in the momentum space and the suppression of the @xmath0-wave component of the order parameter .",
    "the second one is the contamination of the material near interfaces as a result of fabrication process or electromigration in large scale application devices . as a result",
    "the formation of a thin disordered layer near hts surfaces and interfaces is highly probable .",
    "an important question is whether or not superconducting correlations vanish in such a layer in the limit of small mean free path and what is the orbital structure of the superconducting state in the interface region .",
    "surface peculiarities in @xmath0-wave superconductors were extensively discussed in the framework of the theoretical models based on specular quasiparticle reflection from clean interfaces @xcite . zero- and finite - bias anomalies predicted in these papers",
    "were recently observed experimentally in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on the problem of the anomalous proximity effect between a @xmath0-wave superconductor and a thin disordered layer in the limit of strong disorder .",
    "it is shown that an isotropic order parameter is nucleated in such a layer even in the absence of the subdominant pairing interaction in the @xmath1-wave channel .",
    "the spatially - resolved quasiparticle density of states is calculated .",
    "it is shown that zero- and finite - energy peaks are present in the surface density of states in the @xmath0-wave region .",
    "zero - energy peaks are fully smeared out in the disordered layer , which is in a peculiar gapless superconducting state .",
    "two approaches to the study of surface roughness effects in unconventional superconductors were used previously . in the first one",
    "it is assumed that the interface consists of facets with random orientations compared to the crystallographic axes of the material @xcite . according to the second approach",
    ", both sides of an ideal interface are coated by a so - called ovchinnikov s thin disordered layer @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the degree of disorder ( or interface roughness ) is measured by the ratio of the layer thickness @xmath0 to the quasiparticle mean free path in the layer @xmath2 up to now both approaches were used to study the smearing of andreev surface bound states by weak disorder . here",
    "we will concentrate on the regime of strong disorder .",
    "we consider the surface or a weakly transparent barrier in a @xmath0-wave superconductor oriented normal to the crystallographic @xmath3 plane .",
    "we assume that the crossover from the clean to the dirty limit takes place in a thin layer near the surface with mean free path @xmath4 and thickness @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the coherence length of the bulk material .    to study the proximity effect at the interface we use the quasiclassical eilenberger equations @xcite with impurity scattering taken in the born limit .",
    "for our purpose it is convenient to rewrite these equations in terms of functions @xmath7 and @xmath8    @xmath9    @xmath10    @xmath11    @xmath12    here @xmath13 and @xmath14 are respectively the normal and the anomalous quasiclassical propagators , @xmath15 are the matsubara frequencies , @xmath16 is the fermi velocity , @xmath17 is the coordinate in the direction of the surface normal , @xmath18 is the angle between the surface normal and quasiparticle trajectory , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we assume that the fermi surface has a cylindrical shape .    for pure @xmath0-wave interaction the coupling",
    "constant may be written in the form @xcite",
    "@xmath21 where @xmath22 is the misorientation angle between the crystallographic @xmath23 axis and the surface normal .",
    "then according to the self - consistency equation ( [ eq.4 ] ) angular and spatial dependencies of the pair potential are factorized @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath25 has pure @xmath0-wave angular structure everywhere in the interface region .",
    "far from the interface the bulk anomalous propagator also has the @xmath0-wave symmetry    @xmath26    at the same time , as will be shown below , the angular structure of the propagator @xmath27 is essentially modified near the interface and an @xmath1-wave component of @xmath27 is induced .    to proceed",
    "further we have to supplement equations ( [ eq1])-([eq.4 ] ) with the appropriate boundary conditions for the function @xmath28  and its derivative @xmath29 at the interface between the clean and the disordered regions of a @xmath0-wave superconductor ( at @xmath30 ) .",
    "these conditions can be derived by integration of the eilenberger equations ( [ eq1])-([eq.2 ] ) in a small region near the interface . in accordance with ref.@xcite , the first boundary condition is the continuity of @xmath31  at the interface and can be written in the form @xmath32 this condition manifests the current conservation across the interface .",
    "the second boundary condition depends on the backscattering properties of the interface . to account for such a backscattering",
    "we introduce a strongly disordered thin layer located near the interface at @xmath33 , which is characterized by the mean free path @xmath34 , where @xmath35 . assuming that all the boundaries are transparent , integrating eq.([eq.2 ] ) in the interval @xmath36  and taking the limit @xmath37  we arrive at    @xmath38    where @xmath39 .    for @xmath40",
    "eq.([eq.5b ] ) is a direct consequence of the continuity of the eilenberger functions along quasiclassical trajectories which is valid for transparent @xmath41-boundaries @xcite . with increase of @xmath42  the probability of quasiparticle penetration into the @xmath43-layer decreases as @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath45  @xmath46 .",
    "it means that most quasiparticles are diffusively reflected back to the @xmath0-wave region at a length scale smaller than @xmath4 .    in the following",
    "we will consider the case of strong disorder @xmath47 . then in accordance with refs.@xcite it follows from the symmetry of the problem that the boundary condition at the totally reflecting free interface @xmath48 is @xmath49    since @xmath47 and @xmath5",
    ", the dirty limit condition @xmath50 is fulfilled in the disordered layer .",
    "it is straightforward to show from eqs.([eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq.4 ] ) that in this case the pair potential @xmath25 in the disordered layer vanishes due to impurity pair - breaking .",
    "then the angle - averaged functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 at @xmath53 obey the dirty limit usadel equations @xcite in the form which formally coincides with the one valued for a normal metal with @xmath54 .",
    "since the scale of variation of @xmath51 and @xmath52 in this regime is of the order of the dirty limit coherence length @xmath55 the functions @xmath56 and @xmath52 in a thin disordered layer @xmath5 are spatially - independent .    as a result",
    "the eilenberger equations in the region @xmath57 are essentially simplified and have the solution @xmath58    @xmath59    where @xmath60    making use of the boundary conditions eqs.([eq.5a ] ) , ( [ eq.5b ] ) at @xmath30 and of eqs.([eq.6 ] ) , ( [ eq.7 ] ) , one can further reduce the problem to the solution of the eilenberger equations ( [ eq1])-([eq.4 ] ) in the clean @xmath61-wave superconductor @xmath62@xmath63 @xmath64 with the condition ( [ eq.4a ] ) in the bulk ( @xmath65 ) and the following boundary condition at @xmath30 @xmath66 since @xmath67 the boundary condition ( [ eq.11 ] ) has a closed form .    in the following",
    "we will limit ourselves to the situation when the disordered layer produces the most strong effect , namely when @xmath40 .",
    "the isotropic usadel function @xmath68 has to be determined selfconsistently by an iteration procedure .",
    "in the limit @xmath69 the pair potential @xmath70 is a smooth function of @xmath17 at distances of the order of @xmath71 .",
    "then the boundary value problem eqs.(11)-(13 ) is essentially simplified and has the asymptotic solution @xmath72 where    @xmath73}% , \\ ] ]    @xmath74    @xmath75    here prime denotes the derivative with respect to the coordinate @xmath17 . as is seen from the solution ( [ eq.12 ] ) ,",
    "the anomalous green s function @xmath76 at @xmath30 is proportional to the sum of three terms with different angular symmetry .",
    "two of them are the isotropic part @xmath68 and the term with the @xmath0-wave symmetry @xmath77 , while the third term is proportional to the product @xmath78 .",
    "the latter term is a source for nucleation of a nonzero @xmath1-wave component of @xmath76 .",
    "note that according to eq.([eq.12 ] ) the solution @xmath76 at @xmath30 would have pure @xmath0-wave symmetry in the approximation of a spatially independent pair potential @xmath25 .",
    "the reason is that in this case the characteristic length @xmath79 of spatial variation of @xmath76 cancels out from the solution eq.([eq.12 ] ) for @xmath28 , since @xmath79 is present both in eq.(11 ) and in the boundary condition eq.(13 ) . at the same time , in the selfconsistent approach a nonzero angle - averaged value @xmath80 appears at the interface , since the above cancellation is incomplete in the presence of a pair potential gradient .",
    "as suggested in @xcite , an @xmath1-wave component of the order parameter may nucleate at the surface of a @xmath0-wave superconductor if there is a subdominant bulk pairing interaction in the @xmath1-wave channel .",
    "we have demonstrated above that the nonzero @xmath1-wave component @xmath80 is localized near the rough interface even in the absence of a subdominant interaction in the bulk .",
    "it is worth mentioning that since a subdominant @xmath1-wave pairing interaction is not included in the present model , the pair potential @xmath81 still has pure @xmath0-wave angular structure everywhere in the @xmath0-wave region .",
    "for the same reason there is no source for the phase shift between @xmath1- and @xmath0-wave components of @xmath28 , thus the surface @xmath82 state which breaks time - reversal symmetry should not occur in the case considered .    in the general case of arbitrary @xmath71  values",
    "the problem was solved numerically . the isotropic function @xmath68   and the spatially dependent pair potential @xmath70",
    "were calculated by iterating the equations ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) making use of the boundary condition ( [ eq.11 ] ) and the selfconsistency equation ( [ eq.4 ] ) .",
    "the results of numerical calculations shown in figs.1 - 3 confirm the considerations presented above .",
    "fig.1 shows the angular dependence of @xmath28 far from the boundary ( @xmath83 ) , as well as at @xmath84 and @xmath30 , for two different orientations @xmath22 of the @xmath23 axis with respect to the interface normal . in both cases",
    "far from the interface the angular distribution is typical for a @xmath0-wave superconductor . at @xmath84 the positive lobe ( horizontal )",
    "is suppressed stronger than the negative one ( vertical ) , since the characteristic length @xmath85 in the direction perpendicular to the interface is small compared to @xmath85 in the direction parallel to the interface .",
    "hence at @xmath86 negative lobes of @xmath28 practically reach the local value @xmath87 , while positive ones still do not .",
    "this difference leads to the negative sign of the @xmath1-component @xmath80 ( see fig.2 ) .    in the vicinity of the interface @xmath88",
    "the situation is just the opposite . in accordance with solution ( [ eq.12 ] ) , due to the angular dependence of @xmath89 @xmath90",
    "the negative lobes are suppressed stronger than the positive ones , the function @xmath80 changes sign to positive and reaches its maximum at @xmath91    note that for quasiparticle trajectories parallel to the surface , @xmath92 , it follows from eq.([eq.12 ] ) that @xmath93 , while @xmath94 this discontinuity is the manifestation of the simple fact that quasiparticles which propagate exactly parallel to the interface have information about the disordered region only via the local value of the pair potential , while for all other directions the direct interaction between both regions takes place .",
    "however , this discontinuity at @xmath95 does not contribute to the result of the angular averaging of @xmath96 in the boundary condition eq.([eq.11 ] ) .",
    "fig.3 shows the spatial variations of @xmath70 for different values of the angle @xmath22 . as follows from eq.([eq.12 ] ) , the function @xmath97 near the interface has a contribution proportional to @xmath98 .",
    "this immediately leads to the result that the amplitude of the @xmath1-component induced into the disordered layer scales with misorientation angle @xmath22 as @xmath99 at @xmath100 the superconducting correlations are not induced into the disordered layer , i.e. @xmath101 .",
    "further increase of @xmath22 leads to a sigh change of the @xmath1-component .",
    "as is seen from fig.3 , these qualitative considerations are in a good agreement with the results of exact numerical calculations . in particular , for the @xmath102 case ( @xmath100 )",
    "it follows that @xmath101 . at the same time",
    ", it is worth mentioning that the pair potential at the interface , @xmath103 , is nonzero , in contrast to the case of a specular reflecting boundary when @xmath25 at @xmath100 vanishes . in the case",
    "considered of diffusive surface scattering there is no symmetry requirement for the vanishing of @xmath104 .    in the whole temperature range the amplitude of the @xmath1-wave component @xmath56 induced into the disordered layer is an order of magnitude smaller compared to the amplitude of the order parameter in the bulk superconductor ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "that means that @xmath105 is close to unity for all temperatures .",
    "thus , taking into account that @xmath106 is independent of the matsubara frequencies and that @xmath107 , we obtain from the boundary condition eq.([eq.11 ] ) that at low temperature @xmath108 @xmath109 for @xmath110 .",
    "as soon as @xmath111 exceeds the value of @xmath81 , the function @xmath108 behaves as @xmath68 @xmath112 . the density of states @xmath113 , where @xmath114 and @xmath115 is the normal state density of states .",
    "therefore it follows from the property @xmath56 @xmath116 at small @xmath111 that the density of states @xmath117 , i.e. there is a gapless superconducting state in the disordered layer .    to demonstrate this behavior",
    "explicitly we have calculated the density of states by numerical integration of eqs.(11)-(13 ) on the real energy axis making the substitution @xmath118 in these equations .",
    "the results of calculations of the normalized low - temperature density of states @xmath119 at @xmath120 and @xmath121 are presented in fig.4 . to take into account an inelastic scattering we have introduced the complex energy @xmath122 with @xmath123 .    as is seen from fig.4 ,",
    "the density of states in the disordered layer is gapless and has a rather weak and broad peak at an energy below the maximum value of the bulk pair potential @xmath124 .",
    "this peak is a signature of the andreev bound states at finite energies .",
    "note that there is no midgap ( zero - energy ) peak in the density of states in the disordered layer since there is no sign change of the order parameter in this region . at the same time",
    "the density of states at the surface of the @xmath0-wave region ( at @xmath30 ) exhibits a sharp zero - energy peak . in accordance with the known results for specular interfaces",
    "@xcite this peak is due to the midgap states in the surface of the @xmath0-wave region .",
    "an important difference between specular and rough interfaces is that in the former case the midgap states occur only at nonzero values of the misorientation angle @xmath125 , whereas in the latter case these states occur even for @xmath121 .",
    "this result has a simple physical interpretation . due to",
    "the presence of the disordered surface layer incident and reflected quasiparticle trajectories are uncorrelated .",
    "therefore for any @xmath22 there is a finite probability for an incident quasiparticle to experience a sign reversal of the pair potential upon reflection .",
    "then the averaging over incoming trajectories yields the midgap states and as a result the nonvanishing zero - energy peak in the surface density of states appears .",
    "in conclusion , the proximity effect between a @xmath0-wave superconductor and a disordered surface layer is studied theoretically in the regime of strong disorder .",
    "the boundary conditions for the eilenberger equations are derived at the interface between the clean and the disordered regions .",
    "it is shown that superconducting correlations in the disordered layer do not vanish in the limit of small electronic mean free path and the isotropic superconducting state is induced in such a layer .",
    "the crossover from this state to the @xmath0-wave pairing state in the bulk is studied by solving the eilenberger equations .",
    "the quasiparticle density of states in the disordered layer is gapless and shows a broad peak at finite energies , while the density of states at the surface of the @xmath0-wave region exhibits a zero - bias peak due to sign reversal of the order parameter .",
    "this peak is fully smeared out in the disordered layer .",
    "the above phenomena have important consequences for the description of rough hts interfaces and josephson junctions , in particular for sns junctions with a normal metal interlayer .",
