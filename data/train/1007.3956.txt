    "the observable universe is homogeneous and isotropic at a great accuracy @xcite , leading the large majority of cosmological works to focus on homogeneous and isotropic geometries .",
    "the explanation of these features , along with the horizon problem , was the main reason of the inflation paradigm construction @xcite .",
    "although the last subject is well explained , the homogeneity and the isotropy problems are , strictly speaking , not fully solved , since usually one starts straightaway with a homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric , and examines the evolution of fluctuations . on the other hand , the robust approach on",
    "the subject should be to start with an arbitrary metric and show that inflation is indeed realized and that the universe evolves towards an frw geometry , in agreement with observations .",
    "however , the complex structure of such an approach allows only for a numerical elaboration @xcite , and therefore in order to extract analytical solutions many authors start with one assumption more , that is investigating anisotropic but homogeneous cosmologies .",
    "this class of geometries was known since a long time ago @xcite , and it can exhibit very interesting cosmological behavior , either in inflationary or in post - inflationary cosmology @xcite . finally , note that such geometries may be relevant for the description of the black - hole interior @xcite .",
    "the most well - studied homogeneous but anisotropic geometries are the bianchi type ( see @xcite and references therein ) and the kantowski - sachs metrics @xcite , either in conventional or in higher - dimensional framework . although some bianchi models ( for instance the bianchi ix one ) are more realistic , their complicated phase - space behavior led many authors to investigate the simpler but very interesting bianchi i , bianchi iii , and kantowski - sachs geometries",
    ". in these types of metrics one can analytically examine the rich behavior and incorporate also the matter content @xcite , obtaining a very good picture of homogeneous but anisotropic cosmology .",
    "on the other hand the observable universe is now known to be accelerating @xcite , and this feature led physicists to follow two directions in order to explain it .",
    "the first is to introduce the concept of dark energy ( see @xcite and references therein ) in the right - hand - side of the field equations , which could either be the simple cosmological constant or various new exotic ingredients @xcite .",
    "the second direction is to modify the left - hand - side of the field equations , that is to modify the gravitational theory itself , with the extended gravitational theories known as @xmath0-gravity ( see @xcite and references therein ) being the most examined case .",
    "such an approach can still be in the spirit of general relativity since the only request is that the hilbert - einstein action should be generalized ( replacing the ricci scalar @xmath4 by functions of it ) asking for a gravitational interaction acting , in principle , in different ways at different scales .",
    "such extended theories can present very interesting behavior and the corresponding cosmologies have been investigated in detail @xcite .    in the present work we are interested in investigating homogeneous but anisotropic cosmologies , focusing on kantowski - sachs type , in a universe governed by @xmath0-gravity .",
    "in particular , we perform a phase - space and stability analysis of such a scenario , examining in a systematic way the possible cosmological behaviors , focusing on the late - time stable solutions .",
    "such an approach allows us to bypass the high non - linearities of the cosmological equations , which prevent any complete analytical treatment , obtaining a ( qualitative ) description of the global dynamics of these models .",
    "furthermore , in these asymptotic solutions we calculate various observable quantities , such are the deceleration parameter , the effective ( total ) equation - of - state parameter , and the various density parameters .",
    "we stress that the results of anisotropic @xmath0 cosmology are expected to be different than the corresponding ones of @xmath0-gravity in isotropic geometries , similarly to the differences between isotropic @xcite and anisotropic @xcite considerations in general relativity .",
    "additionally , the results are expected to be different from anisotropic general relativity , too .",
    "as we see , anisotropic @xmath0 cosmology can be consistent with observations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sectionii ] we construct the cosmological scenario of anisotropic @xmath0-gravity , presenting the kinematical and dynamical variables , particularizing on the @xmath5 ansatz in the case of kantowski - sachs geometry .",
    "having extracted the cosmological equations , in section [ sectioniii ] we perform a systematic phase - space and stability analysis of the system .",
    "thus , in section [ sectioniv ] we analyze the physical implications of the obtained results , and we discuss the cosmological behaviors of the scenario at hand .",
    "finally , our results are summarized in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we present the basic features of anisotropic bianchi i , bianchi iii , and kantowski - sachs geometries . after presenting the kinematical and dynamical variables in the first two subsections , we focus on the kantowski - sachs geometrical background and on the @xmath1-gravity in the last two subsections .      in order to investigate anisotropic cosmologies",
    ", it is usual to assume an anisotropic metric of the form @xcite : where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the expansion scale factors .",
    "the frame vectors in coordinate form are written as @xmath8 the metric can describe three geometric families , that is @xmath9 known respectively as kantowski - sachs , bianchi i and bianchi iii models .    in the following , we will focus on the kantowski - sachs geometry @xcite , since it is the most popular anisotropic model , and since all solutions are known analytically in the case of general relativity , even if some particular types of matter are coupled to gravity @xcite . these are spatially homogeneous spherically symmetric models",
    "@xcite , with 4 killing vectors : @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "let us now consider relativistic fluid dynamics ( see for e.g. @xcite ) in such a geometry .",
    "for any given fluid 4-velocity vector field @xmath11 , the projection tensor @xmath12 projects into the instantaneous rest - space of a comoving observer . it is standard to decompose the first covariant derivative @xmath13 into its irreducible parts @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the symmetric and trace - free shear tensor ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) , @xmath19 is the antisymmetric vorticity tensor ( @xmath20}$ ] , @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 is the acceleration vector defined as @xmath23 ( a dot denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath24 ) . in the above expression",

    "one obtains the `` trace equation '' ( equation ( 5 ) in section iia of @xcite ) @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the trace of the energy - momentum tensor of ordinary matter .    in the phenomenological fluid description of a general matter source , the standard decomposition of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath54 with respect to a timelike vector field @xmath55",

    ", the anisotropic pressure tensor is given by @xmath64 , where @xmath65      let us now present the cosmological equations in the homogeneous and anisotropic kantowski - sachs metric . in particular , the einstein s equations in the kantowski - sachs metric read @xmath66 in these expressions @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the energy density and pressure of the matter perfect fluid , and their ratio gives the matter equation - of - state parameter @xmath67 furthermore , @xmath68 is the gauss curvature of the 3-spheres @xcite given by @xmath69 and its evolution equation writes @xmath70 additionally , the evolution equation for @xmath34 reads ( see equation ( 42 ) in section 4.1 of @xcite ) @xmath71 finally , observing the form of the first of equations ( [ varyingaction ] ) one can define the various density parameters of the scenario at hand , namely @xcite the curvature one @xmath72 the matter one @xmath73 the `` curvature - fluid '' one @xmath74 and the shear one @xmath75 satisfying @xmath76 .",

    "finally , these equations should be completed by considering the evolution equations for matter sources .      in this subsection",
    "we specify the above general cosmological system .",
    "in particular , in order to continue we have to make an assumption concerning the function @xmath0 .",
    "we impose an ansatz of the form @xmath85 @xcite , since such an ansatz does not alter the characteristic length scale ( and general relativity is recovered when @xmath86 ) , and it leads to simple exact solutions which allow for comparison with observations @xcite . additionally , following @xcite we consider that the parameter @xmath2 is related to the matter equation - of - state parameter through @xmath87 such a choice is imposed by the requirement of the existence of an einstein static universe in frw backgrounds , which leads to a severe constraint in @xmath0 , namely @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",
    "inversely , it can be seen as the equation - of - state parameter of ordinary matter is a fixed function of @xmath2 , if we desire einstein static solutions to exist .",
    "the existence of such a static solution ( in practice as a saddle - unstable one ) is of great importance in every cosmological theory , since it connects the friedmann matter - dominated phase with the late - time accelerating phase , as required by observations @xcite .",
    "thus , if we relax the condition @xmath90 in @xmath1-gravity , in general we can not obtain the epoch - sequence of the universe . finally , note that the constraint @xmath91 that arises from the satisfaction of all the energy conditions for standard matter , imposes bounds on @xmath2 , namely @xmath92 $ ] , with the most interesting cases being those of dust ( @xmath93 , @xmath94 ) and radiation fluid ( @xmath95 , @xmath96 ) .",
    "the cosmological equations for @xmath1-gravity , in the homogeneous and anisotropic kantowski - sachs metric ( [ metric ] ) , are obtained by specializing equations , , , , , and consider the conservation equation for standard matter .",
    "equations , , and , become respectively @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 additionally , we consider the evolution equation for the 2-curvature @xmath68 given by , as well as the matter conservation equation @xmath101 finally , in order to close the equation - system we consider also the propagation equation .",
    "in the previous section we formulated @xmath0-gravity in the case of the homogeneous and anisotropic kantowski - sachs geometry , focusing on the @xmath85 ansatz . having extracted the cosmological equations we can investigate the possible cosmological behaviors and discuss the corresponding physical implications by performing a phase - space analysis .",
    "such a procedure bypasses the complexity of the cosmological equations and provides us the understanding of the dynamics of these scenarios .      in order to perform the phase - space and stability analysis of the models at hand",
    ", we have to transform the cosmological equations into an autonomous dynamical system @xcite .",
    "however , since the present system is more complicated , in order to avoid ambiguities related to the non - compactness at infinity we define compact variables that can describe both expanding and collapsing models @xcite . this will be achieved by introducing the auxiliary variables @xcite : @xmath102 where we have defined @xmath103 furthermore , we introduce the time variable @xmath104 through @xmath105 and from now on primes will denote derivatives with respect to @xmath104 . finally , note that in the following we focus on the general case @xmath106 .",

    "in particular , eigenvalues with negative ( positive ) real parts correspond to a stable ( unstable ) point , while eigenvalues with real parts of different sign correspond to a saddle point .",

    "there are two invariant sets given by @xmath129 , corresponding to @xmath130 , that is @xmath131 however , the solutions of the evolution equations inside this invariant set do not correspond to exact solutions of the field equations , since the frame variables has to satisfy @xmath132 .",

    "they exist for @xmath144 $ ] , they are located in the boundary of @xmath145 , and they correspond to solutions in the full phase space , satisfying @xmath146 . in order to be more transparent , let us consider the parametrization @xmath147\\right.\\ ] ]    for all the critical points we calculate the eigenvalues of the perturbation matrix @xmath148 , which will determine their stability .",

    "therefore , we deduce that :    * no part of @xmath152 ( @xmath153 ) is a stable ( unstable ) . thus , any part of @xmath152 ( @xmath153 ) is either unstable ( stable ) or saddle . * for @xmath154 one branch of @xmath153 ( @xmath155 ) is stable , and one branch of @xmath152 ( @xmath156 ) is unstable . * for @xmath157 the whole @xmath153 is stable and the whole @xmath152 is unstable . * for @xmath158 one branch of @xmath153 ( @xmath159 ) is stable , and one branch of @xmath152 ( @xmath160 ) is unstable .",

    "these results are presented in the table [ tab2a ] .",
    "furthermore , for each critical point we use ( [ physsolutions ] ) and ( [ lengthscale ] ) , in order to extract the behavior of the physically important quantities @xmath188 , @xmath189 and @xmath190 at this critical point .",
    "as we have mentioned @xmath188 is the length scale along the flow lines and in the case of zero anisotropy ( for instance in frw cosmology ) it is just the usual scale factor .",
    "additionally , @xmath189 is the matter energy density and @xmath190 is the ricci scalar .",
    "these solutions are presented in the last column of tables [ tab2b ] and [ tab2c ] .",
    "finally , in the last column of tables [ tab2b ] and [ tab2c ] we also present the physical description of the corresponding solution , taking into account all the above information .",
    "in particular , since the auxiliary variable @xmath191 defined in ( [ auxiliary ] ) is the hubble scalar divided by a positive constant , @xmath192 corresponds to an expanding universe , while @xmath193 to a contracting one .",
    "furthermore , as usual , for an expanding universe @xmath194 corresponds to accelerating expansion and @xmath195 to decelerating expansion , while for a contracting universe @xmath194 corresponds to decelerating contraction and @xmath195 to accelerating contraction . additionally , if @xmath196 then the total equation - of - state parameter of the universe exhibits phantom behavior .",
    "lastly , critical points with @xmath197 correspond to isotropic universes .",
    "let us analyze the physical behavior in more details .",
    "the critical point @xmath198 is stable for @xmath199 , and thus at late times the universe can result in it .",
    "it corresponds to an isotropic expanding universe , in which the expansion is accelerating .",
    "additionally , since the curvature energy density is zero , this point corresponds to an asymptotically flat universe ( this is equivalent to close or open frw universes which may possess zero curvature solutions as asymptotic states ) .",
    "furthermore , in the case @xmath3 the total equation - of - state parameter of the universe exhibits phantom behavior .",
    "thus , the anisotropic kantowsky - sachs @xmath1-gravity can lead the universe not only to be accelerating , but also to be in the phantom `` phase '' , a result of great cosmological interest .",
    "we have to mention here that since point @xmath198 is asymptotically an frw one , one expects to obtain phantom behavior in isotropic ( frw ) @xmath1-gravity too .",
    "although in the phase - space analysis of frw @xmath1-gravity @xcite , the authors have focused only on acceleration , without examining the total equation - of - state parameter of the universe , it is easy to see that if ones defines it and examines its features he will find phantom behavior in that case too .",
    "this is also the case in bianchi i and bianchi iii @xmath1-gravity @xcite , where the authors would have found the phantom behavior if they had calculated the total equation - of - state parameter .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the phantom behavior is a result of the modification of gravity , as it has been discussed in detail in the literature @xcite . finally , in the case where the matter is dust ( @xmath93 , that is @xmath94 ) , @xmath189 behaves like @xmath200 as expected , and this acts as a self - consistency test for our analysis .",
    "additionally , note that in the special case @xmath96 , that is when @xmath95 , i.e when radiation dominates the universe , the aforementioned stable solution corresponds to a de - sitter expansion ( this is not a new feature since de - sitter solutions are known to exist in bianchi i and bianchi iii @xmath1-gravity @xcite ) .",
    "this is of great significance since such a behavior can describe the inflationary epoch of the universe .    in the above critical point",
    "the isotropization has been achieved .",
    "such late - time isotropic solutions , than can attract an initially anisotropic universe , are of significant cosmological interest and have been obtained and discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "the acquisition of such a solution was one of the motives of the present work , as of many works on anisotropic cosmologies , since , as we discussed in the introduction , it is the only robust approach in confronting isotropy of standard cosmology .",

    "is highly unstable and therefore it can not attract the universe at late times .",
    "we mention here that the critical points @xmath174,@xmath175,@xmath217,@xmath218 and @xmath204 are not present in isotropic ( frw ) @xmath1-gravity , as compared with @xcite .",
    "they arise as a pure result of the anisotropy , and this shows that the much more complicated structure of anisotropic geometries leads to radically different cosmological behaviors comparing to the simple isotropic scenarios .",
    "additionally , we have to analyze the behavior of the curves of critical points @xmath149 .",
    "the points @xmath153 , which correspond to accelerating contraction , are stable if @xmath219 , and thus they can be late - time solutions of the universe .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath152 , which correspond to decelerating expansion , are unstable and thus they can not attract the universe at late times .",
    "let us finish the physical discussion by referring to static solutions , in order to compare to the frw case of @xcite . from the cosmological point of view , static solutions possess @xmath220 , that is @xmath221 and @xmath222=0 , in order to obtain @xmath223 and @xmath224 ( note that one needs both conditions , since in a cosmological bounce or turnaround , that is when a universe changes from contracting to expanding or vice versa , @xmath225 is zero instantly , but then it becomes positive or negative again ) .",
    "thus , using our auxiliary variable @xmath191 defined in ( [ auxiliary ] ) static solutions should have @xmath226 and @xmath227 . in conclusion , since in all the aforementioned critical points @xmath227 by definition , static solutions are just those with @xmath226 . at this point",
    "there is another important difference comparing to the isotropic case of @xcite .",
    "in particular , in frw geometry , the ricci scalar is @xmath228 , and therefore static solutions have @xmath229 ( however the inverse is not true , that is not all solutions with @xmath229 correspond to static ones , since one can have @xmath229 but with @xmath230 and @xmath231 non - zero ) . on the other hand , in the anisotropic case",

    "thus , in the anisotropic case one can not use @xmath4 , or equivalently the auxiliary variable @xmath235 defined in ( [ auxiliary ] ) , in order to straightway determine the static solutions , in contrast to the isotropic case @xcite where the authors use @xmath133 for such a determination .",

    "it is interesting to note that such behaviors can be realized in frw @xmath1-gravity @xcite , however they are impossible in general relativity kantowsky - sachs cosmology @xcite .",

    "however , in the present case we have the additional existence of an heteroclinic sequence of type @xmath252 , corresponding to the transition from collapsing ads to expanding ds phase , that is we obtain a cosmological bounce followed by a de sitter expansion , which could describe the inflationary stage .",

    "let us make a comment here by referring to the cosmological epoch sequence .",
    "as we mentioned in subsection [ sectionii.4 ] , in the scenario at hand we can obtain the transition from the matter - dominated era to the accelerated one .",
    "however , note that the dynamical system analysis can only give analytical results relating to the late - time states of the universe .",
    "the precise evolution of the universe towards such late - time attractors depends on the initial conditions , and it can only be investigated through a detailed numerical elaboration similar to the partial one that we performed in order to produce the aforementioned three figures .",
    "thus , by suitably determining the initial conditions , one can obtain universes that start with a de - sitter expansion , then transit to the matter - dominated era , and finally falling into the late time accelerating solution .",
    "the detailed examination of such behaviors , along with the investigation of the basins of attraction of the various evolutions in terms of the initial conditions , and the estimation of the measures of the corresponding sub - spaces of the phase space , lie outside of the present work and are left for a future project .",
    "we close this section by discussing the cosmological evolution in the special case where @xmath260 or @xmath130 , since in this case the kantowsky - sachs metric ( in a comoving frame ) @xmath261,\\label{dimensionlessmetric}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is singular .",
    "although these points are unphysical their neighbouring solutions could have physical meaning , which can be extracted by obtaining first - order evolution rates valid in an small neighborhood of the critical points of the system .",
    "in particular , we first evaluate the perturbation - matrix @xmath262 at the critical point of interest , we diagonalize it and we obtain orders of magnitude for linear combinations of the vector components @xmath263 .",
    "thus , the desired expansion can be obtained by taking the inverse linear transformation , and finally we preserve only the leading order terms as @xmath264 or as @xmath265 .",
    "although this procedure is straightforward in the case of dust matter ( @xmath93 , @xmath94 ) and radiation ( @xmath95 , @xmath96 ) we do not present it explicitly since we desire to remain in the general case of @xmath266 and @xmath267 .",
    "in this work we constructed general anisotropic cosmological scenarios where the gravitational sector belongs to the extended @xmath0 type , and we focused on kantowski - sachs geometries in the case of @xmath1-gravity .",
    "we performed a detailed phase - space analysis , extracting the late - time solutions , and we connected the mathematical results with physical behaviors and observables .",
    "as we saw , the universe at late times can result to a state of accelerating expansion , and additionally , for a particular @xmath2-range ( @xmath3 ) it exhibits phantom behavior . additionally , the universe has been isotropized , independently of the anisotropy degree of the initial conditions , and it asymptotically becomes flat .",
    "the fact that such features are in agreement with observations @xcite is a significant advantage of the model .",
    "moreover , in the case of radiation ( @xmath96 , @xmath95 ) the aforementioned stable solution corresponds to a de - sitter expansion , and it can also describe the inflationary epoch of the universe .",
    "note that at first sight the above behavior could be ascribed to the cosmic no - hair theorem @xcite , which states that a solution of the cosmological equations , with a positive cosmological constant and under the perfect - fluid assumption for matter , converges to the de sitter solution at late times .",
    "however , we mention that such a theorem holds for matter - fluids less stiff than radiation , but more importantly it has been elaborated for general relativity @xcite , without a robust extension to higher order gravitational theories @xcite . in our work",
    "we extracted our results without relying at all on the cosmic no - hair theorem , which is a significant advantage of the analysis .",
    "apart from the above behavior , in the scenario at hand the universe has a large probability to remain in a phase of ( isotropic or anisotropic ) decelerating expansion for a long time , before it will be attracted by the above global attractor at late times , and this acts as an additional advantage of the model , since it is in agreement with the observed cosmological behavior .",
    "however , the precise duration of such a transient phase , unlike the attractor behavior , does depend on the initial conditions of the universe , which have to be suitable determined in order to lead to a deceleration - duration of the order of @xmath268-@xmath269 years , before the universe pass to the accelerating phase .",
    "such an analysis can only arise through an explicit numerical elaboration , that is beyond the analytical , dynamical - system treatment which is where the present work focuses .",
    "the kantowski - sachs anisotropic @xmath1-gravity can also lead to contracting solutions , either accelerating or decelerating , which are not globally stable .",
    "thus , the universe can remain near these states for a long time , before the dynamics remove it towards the above expanding , accelerating , late - time attractors .",
    "the duration of these transient phases depends on the specific initial conditions .",
    "one of the most interesting behaviors is the possibility of the realization of the transition between expanding and contracting solutions during the evolution .",
    "that is , the scenario at hand can exhibit the cosmological bounce or turnaround .",
    "additionally , there can also appear an eternal transition between expanding and contracting phases , that is we can obtain cyclic cosmology .",
    "these features can be of great significance for cosmology , since they are desirable in order for a model to be free of past or future singularities .    before closing , let us make some comments concerning the use of observational data in order to constrain the present scenario . in particular , equation ( [ gauss111 ] ) , along with the @xmath1-ansatz , relation ( [ wn ] ) , and the definitions of the density parameters ( [ omegas1])-([omegas4 ] ) , can be straightforwardly written in the form used for observational fitting @xcite .",
    "thus , one can use observational data from type ia supernovae ( snia ) , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , along with requirements of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , to constrain the model parameter @xmath2 .",
    "additionally , one can constrain the initial allowed anisotropy value @xmath233 ( or @xmath187 ) , through its present value @xmath270 and the shear evolution ( [ shear ] ) . such a procedure",
    "is necessary for every cosmological paradigm , and can significantly enlighten the scenario at hand .",
    "however , since in the present work we focused on the dynamical features , the detailed observational elaboration is left for a separate project .    in summary ,",
    "anisotropic @xmath1-gravity has a very rich cosmological behavior , and a large variety of evolutions and late - time solutions , compatible with observations .",
    "the much more complicated structure of anisotropic geometries leads to radically different implications comparing to the simple isotropic scenarios .",

    "we do not use @xmath284-normalization , however , as @xmath286 is approached , a similar physical behavior is attained ( that is the radial part of the metric tends to zero and the local null cone collapses onto the timeline ) . ] note that , as current investigations suggest , in @xmath287-cosmologies , that is in cosmologies where there is no symmetry , both past and future attractors belong to the silent boundary @xcite .    in the present work we do not focus in how kantowsky - sachs @xmath0 are related to more general anisotropic models , and thus , we do not elaborate completely equation .",
    "however , we can still obtain the corresponding significant physical information , since the stability along the @xmath113 direction is determined by calculating the sign of @xmath288 , which coincides with the eigenvalue associated to the eigenvector @xmath113 .",
    "thus , if it is negative then the small perturbations in the @xmath113 direction decay , while if it is positive they enhance .        from the signs of @xmath295 it follows that @xmath296 ( @xmath297 ) is stable ( unstable ) to small perturbations in the @xmath113 direction provided @xmath298 otherwise it is unstable ( stable ) .",

    "<S> contracting solutions have also a large probability to be the late - time states of the universe . finally , we can also obtain the realization of the cosmological bounce and turnaround , as well as of cyclic cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> these features indicate that anisotropic geometries in modified gravitational frameworks present radically different cosmological behaviors comparing to the simple isotropic scenarios . </S>"
