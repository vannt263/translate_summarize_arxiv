    "three - dimensional ( 3d ) modeling of solar phenomena has always been a challenge with the available two - dimensional ( 2d ) images , but is an utmost necessity to test physical models in a quantitative way . since solar imaging telescopes",
    "never have been launched on multiple spacecraft that separate to a significant parallax angle from the earth , no true 3d imaging or solar tomography ( davila 1994 ; gary , davis , & moore 1998 ; liewer et al .",
    "2001 ) has been performed so far .",
    "the _ solar terrestrial relations observatory ( stereo ) _ , now being assembled and planned for launch in november 2005 , will be the first true stereoscopic facility , mapping the sun with an increasing separation angle of @xmath4 per year .",
    "alternative approaches of 3d reconstruction methods utilize the solar rotation to vary the aspect angle ( altschuler 1979 ; berton & sakurai 1985 ; koutchmy & molodensky 1992 ; aschwanden & bastian 1994a , b ; batchelor 1994 ; hurlburt et al . 1994 ; zidowitz 1999 ; koutchmy , merzlyakov , & molodensky 2001 ) , but this method generally requires static structures over several days .",
    "an advanced form of solar rotation stereoscopy is the so - called _ dynamic stereoscopy _ method ( aschwanden et al .",
    "1999 , 2000a ) , where the 3d geometry of dynamic plasma structures can be reconstructed as long as the guiding magnetic field is quasi - stationary . of course",
    ", 3d modeling with 2d constraints can also be attempted if a - priori assumptions are made for the geometry , e.g. using the assumption of coplanar and semi - circular loops ( nitta , vandriel - gestelyi , & harra - murnion 1999 ) .",
    "a new branch of 3d modeling is the combination of 2d images @xmath5 with the frequency dimension @xmath6 , which we call _ frequency tomography_. there have been only very few attempts to apply this method to solar data , mainly because multi - frequency imaging was not available or had insufficient spatial resolution .",
    "there are essentially only three published studies that employ the method of frequency tomography : aschwanden et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ; bogod & grebinskij ( 1997 ) ; grebinskij et al .",
    "( 2000 . ) .    in the first study ( aschwanden et al .",
    "1995 ) , gyroresonance emission above a sunspot was observed at 7 frequencies in both polarizations in the frequency range of @xmath7 ghz with the _ owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) _ during 4 days . from stereoscopic correlations",
    "the height levels @xmath8 of each frequency could be determined above the sunspot .",
    "correcting for the jump in height when dominant gyroresonance emission switches from the second ( @xmath9 ) to the third harmonic ( @xmath10 ) , the magnetic field @xmath11 [ g ] could then be derived as a function of height , @xmath12 , and was found to fit a classical dipole field @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , from the measured brightness temperature spectrum @xmath14 , using the same stereoscopic height measurement @xmath8 , also the temperature profile @xmath15 as a function of height above the sunspot could be determined .",
    "this study represents an application of _ frequency tomography _ , additionally supported with _",
    "solar rotation stereoscopy _ , and thus is subject to the requirement of quasi - stationary structures .    in the second study (",
    "bogod & grebinskij 1997 ) , brightness temperature spectra @xmath16 were measured in 36 frequencies in the wavelength range of @xmath17 cm ( @xmath18 ghz ) with ratan-600 , from quiet - sun regions , active region plages , and from coronal holes . a differential deconvolution method of laplace",
    "transform inversion was then used to infer the electron temperature @xmath19 as a function of the opacity @xmath20 .",
    "this method does not yield the temperature as a function of an absolute height @xmath21 , but if an atmospheric model [ @xmath22 is available as a function of height , the temperature as a function of the free - free ( bremsstrahlung ) opacity @xmath19 can be calculated and compared with the observations .    in the third study ( grebinskij et al .",
    "2000 ) , the brightness temperature in both polarizations is measured as a function of frequency , i.e. @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "since the magnetic field has a slightly different refractive index in the two circular polarizations , the free - free ( bremsstrahlung ) opacity is consequently also slightly different , so that the magnetic field @xmath25 can be inferred .",
    "again , a physical model [ @xmath26 is needed to predict @xmath25 and to compare it with the observed spectrum @xmath16 .",
    "the content of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we simulate an active region , with the 3d geometry constrained by an observed magnetogram and the physical parameters given by hydrostatic solutions , which are used to calculate fasr radio images in terms of brightness temperature maps @xmath27 , and test how the physical parameters of individual coronal loops can be retrieved with fasr tomography . in section 3",
    "we discuss a few examples of chromospheric and quiet - sun corona modeling to illustrate the power and limitations of fasr tomography . in the final section 5",
    "we summarize some primary goals of fasr science that can be pursued with frequency tomography .",
    "our aim is to build a realistic 3d model of an active region , in form of 3d distributions of the electron density @xmath28 and electron temperature @xmath29 , which can be used to simulate radio brightness temperature maps @xmath30 at arbitrary frequencies @xmath6 that can be obtained with the planned _ frequency - agile solar radiotelescope ( fasr)_.    we start from a magnetogram recorded with the _ michelson doppler imager ( mdi ) _ instrument onboard the _ solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) _ on 1999 may 8 , 0 - 1 ut .",
    "we perform a potential field extrapolation with the magnetogram as lower boundary condition of the photospheric magnetic field , to obtain the 3d geometry of magnetic field lines .",
    "we apply a threshold for the minimum magnetic field at the footpoints , which limits the number of extrapolated field lines to @xmath31 .",
    "the projection of these 3d field lines along the line - of - sight onto the solar disk is shown in fig.1 .",
    "we basically see two groups of field lines , ( 1 ) a compact double arcade with low - lying field lines in an active region in the north - east quadrant of the sun , and ( 2 ) a set of large - scale field lines that spread out from the eastern active region to the west and close in the western hemisphere . from this set of field lines",
    "we have constrained the 3d geometry of 500 coronal loops , defined by a length coordinate @xmath32 .    in a next step",
    "we fill the 500 loops with coronal plasma with density @xmath1 and temperature functions @xmath2 that obey hydrostatic solutions . for accurate analytical approximations of hydrostatic solutions we used the code given in aschwanden & schrijver ( 2002 ) .",
    "each hydrostatic solution is defined by three independent parameters : the loop length @xmath33 , the loop base heating rate @xmath34 , and the heating scale height @xmath35 .",
    "the momentum and energy balance equation ( between the heating rate and radiative and conductive loss rate , i.e. @xmath36 , yields a unique solution for each parameter set @xmath37 . for the set of short loops located in the compact double arcade , which have have lengths of @xmath38 mm , we choose a heating scale height of @xmath39 mm and base heating rates that are randomly distributed in the logarithmic interval of @xmath40 erg @xmath41 s@xmath42 . for the group of long loops with lengths of @xmath43 mm ,",
    "we choose near - uniform heating ( @xmath44 mm ) and volumetric heating rates randomly distributed in the logarithmic interval of @xmath45 erg @xmath41 s@xmath42 .",
    "this choice of heating rates produces a distribution of loop maximum temperatures ( at the loop tops ) of @xmath46 mk , electron densities of @xmath47 @xmath41 at the footpoints , and @xmath48 @xmath41 at the loop tops .",
    "we show the distribution of loop top temperatures , loop base densities , and loop top densities in fig.2 .",
    "these parameters are considered to be realistic in the sense that they reproduce typical loop densities and temperatures observed with _",
    "soho _ and _ trace _ , as well as correspond to the measured heating scale heights of @xmath49 mm ( aschwanden , nightingale , & alexander 2000b ) , for the set of short loops .",
    "for the simulation of radio images we choose an image size of @xmath50 pixels , with a pixel size of 2.25 \" , and 21 frequencies logarithmically distributed between @xmath51 mhz and 10 ghz .",
    "to each magnetic field line we attribute a loop with a width ( or column depth ) of @xmath52 cm . for each voxel ,",
    "i.e. volume element at @xmath53 , we calculate the free - free absorption coefficient @xmath54 ( e.g. lang 1980 , p.47 ) , @xmath55 \\ , \\ ] ] and integrate the opacity @xmath56 along the line - of - sight @xmath57 , @xmath58 to obtain the radio brightness temperature @xmath59 with the radiative transfer equation ( in the rayleigh - jeans limit ) , @xmath60 the simulated images for the frequency range of @xmath6=100 mhz to 10 ghz are shown in figs.3 and 4 .",
    "the approximate instrumental resolution is rendered by smoothing the simulated images with a boxcar that corresponds to the instrumental resolution of fasr , @xmath61    a caveat needs to be made , that the real reconstructed radio images may reach this theoretical resolution only if a sufficient number of fourier components are available , either from a large number of baselines ( which scale with the square of the number of dishes ) or from aperture synthesis ( which increases the number of fourier components during earth rotation proportionally to the accumulation time interval ) .",
    "also , we did not include here the effects of angular scattering due to turbulence or other coronal inhomogeneities ( bastian 1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "the intensity of radio maps is usually specified in terms of the observed brightness temperature @xmath62 .",
    "we list the peak brightness temperature in each map in figs.3 and 4 .",
    "we see that a maximum brightness is observed in the second - last map in fig.4 , with @xmath63 mk at a frequency of @xmath64 ghz .",
    "let us obtain some understanding of the relative brightness temperatures @xmath14 as function of frequency @xmath6 , in order to faciliate the interpretation of radio maps .",
    "we plot the peak brightness temperature @xmath14 of the simulated maps as function of frequency in fig.5 ( cross symbols ) .",
    "there are two counter - acting effects that reduce the brightness temperature : first , the loops become optically thin at high frequencies due to the @xmath65-dependence of the free - free opacity ( eq.1 ) . hot loops with a temperature of t=2.0 mk , a density of @xmath66 @xmath41 , and a width of w=2.5 mm are optically thick below @xmath67 ghz , so the brightness temperature would match the electron temperature @xmath68 ( dashed line in fig.5 ) , but falls off at higher frequencies , i.e. @xmath69 ghz)@xmath70 .    the second effect that reduces the brightness temperature is the beam dilution , which has a @xmath71-dependence below the critical frequency where structures are unresolved .",
    "the effectively observed brightness temperature @xmath72 due to beam dilution for a structure with width @xmath73 is @xmath74 where the critical frequency @xmath75 depends on the width @xmath73 of the structure and is for fasr according to eq.(4 ) , @xmath76 \\ .\\ ] ] because the brightness drops drastically below @xmath77 ghz in fig.5 , we conclude that the width of the unresolved structures is about @xmath78 mm",
    ". therefore we can understand the peak brightness temperatures in the maps , as shown in fig.5 ( crosses ) in the range of @xmath79 ghz with a combination of these two effects of free - free opacity and beam dilution .",
    "below a frequency of @xmath80 ghz , we see that another group of loops contributes to the peak brightness of the maps .",
    "we find that the peak brightness below 3 ghz can adequately be understood by a group of cooler loops with a temperature of @xmath81 mk , densities of @xmath66 @xmath41 , and widths of @xmath82 mm ( fig.5 ) .",
    "thus cool loops dominate the brightness at low frequencies , and hot loops at higher frequencies .    in the simulations in figs.3 and 4",
    "we have not included the background corona . in order to give a comparison of the effect of the background corona we calculate the opacity for a space - filling corona with an average temperature of @xmath83 mk , an average density of @xmath84 @xmath41 , and a vertical ( isothermal ) scale height of @xmath85 mm .",
    "the brightness temperature of this background corona is shown with a thick grey curve ( labeled b ) in fig.5 . according to this estimate",
    ", the background corona overwhelms the brightest active region loops at frequencies of @xmath86 ghz . from this",
    "we conclude that it might be difficult to observe active region loops at decimetric frequencies",
    "@xmath87 ghz , unless they are very high and stick out above a density scale height , i.e. at altitudes of @xmath88 mm . in conclusion , the contrast of active region loops in our example seems to be best at frequencies of @xmath89 ghz , but drops at both sides of this optimum frequency ( see fig.5 ) .",
    "fasr will provide simultaneous sets of images @xmath90 at many frequencies @xmath6 .",
    "in other words , for every image position @xmath91 , a spectrum @xmath92 can be obtained .",
    "a desirable capability is temperature and density diagnostic of active region loops .",
    "let us parameterize the projected position of a loop by a length coordinate @xmath93 , @xmath94 , e.g. @xmath95 $ ] .",
    "if we manage to determine the temperature @xmath96 and density @xmath97 at every loop position @xmath91 , we have a diagnostic of the temperature profile @xmath98 and density profile @xmath1 of an active region loop .",
    "thus , the question is whether we can manage to extract a temperature @xmath99 and density @xmath100 from a brightness temperature spectrum @xmath14 at a given pixel position @xmath101 . in order to illustrate the feasibility of this task",
    ", we show the brightness temperature spectrum @xmath16 of a typical active region loop in fig.6 , and display its variation as a function of the physical ( @xmath99 , @xmath100 ) and geometric ( @xmath73 ) parameters .",
    "we define a typical active region loop by an electron temperature @xmath102 mk , an electron density @xmath103 @xmath41 , and a width @xmath104 mm .",
    "such a loop is brightest at frequencies of @xmath105 ghz ( fig.6 ; thick curve ) .",
    "the loop is fainter at higher frequencies because free - free emission becomes optically thin , while it is optically thick at lower frequencies .",
    "the reason why the loop is also fainter at low frequencies is because of the beam dilution at frequencies where the instrument does not resolve the loop diameter .",
    "if we increase the temperature , the brightness temperature increases , and vice versa decreases at lower electron temperatures ( fig.6 top ) .",
    "if we increase the density , the critical frequency where the loop becomes optically thin shifts to higher frequencies , while the peak brightness temperature decreases for lower densities ( fig.6 , middle panel ) . if we increase the width of the loops , the brightness temperature spectrum is bright in a much larger frequency range , because we shift the critical frequency for beam dilution towards lower frequencies , while the overall brightness temperature decreases for a smaller loop width ( fig.6 bottom ) .",
    "based on this little tutorial , one can essentially understand how the optimization works in spectral fitting ( e.g. with a forward - fitting technique ) to an observed brightness temperature spectrum @xmath14 .    to demonstrate how the density and temperature diagnostic works in practice",
    ", we pick a bright loop seen at @xmath106 ghz in fig.4 , which we show as an enlarged detail in fig.7 ( left panel ) .",
    "we pick three locations ( a , b , c ) along the loop and extract the brightness temperature spectra @xmath16 from the simulated datacube @xmath27 at the locations ( a , b , c ) , shown in fig.7 ( three middle panels ) .",
    "each spectrum shows two peaks , which we interpret as two cospatial loops . for each spectral peak we can",
    "therefore roughly fit a loop model , constrained by three parameters each , i.e. @xmath107 $ ] .",
    "we can now fit a brightness temperature spectrum @xmath72 to the observed ( or simulated here ) spectrum @xmath108 , physically defined by the same radiation transfer model for free - free emission as in eqs.(1 - 5 ) , but simplified by the approximation of constant parameters @xmath109 , and thus a constant absorption coefficient @xmath110 , over the relatively small spatial extent of a loop diameter @xmath73 , @xmath111 \\ , \\ ] ] @xmath112 @xmath113 @xmath114 what can immediately be determined from the observed brightness temperature spectra @xmath108 are the frequencies of the spectral peaks ( fig.7 , middle panels ) , which are found around @xmath115 and 6.0 ghz .",
    "based on the tutorial given in fig.6 it is clear that these spectral peaks demarcate the critical frequencies where structures become unresolved .",
    "thus we can immediately determine the diameters of the two loops with eq.(6 ) , i.e. @xmath116 mm and @xmath117 mm .",
    "the only thing left to do is to vary the temperature and density and to fit the model ( eqs.7 - 10 ) to the observed spectrum . for an approximate solution ( shown as smooth curves in the middle panels of fig.7 ) we find @xmath118 mk and @xmath119 @xmath41 for the first loop ( with width @xmath120 mm and spectral peak at @xmath121 ghz ) , and @xmath122 mk and @xmath123 @xmath41 for the second loop ( with width @xmath124 mm and spectral peak at @xmath125 ghz ) .",
    "the resulting temperature @xmath2 and density profiles @xmath1 along the loops are shown in fig.7 ( right panels ) .",
    "this approximate fit is just an example to illustrate the concept of forward - fitting to fasr tomographic data .",
    "more information can be extracted from the data by detailed fits with variable loop cross - section along the loop and proper deconvolution of the projected column depth across the loop diameter ( which is a function of the aspect angle between the line - of - sight and the loop axis ) .",
    "for a proper determination of the inclination angle of the loop plane , the principle of _ dynamic stereoscopy _ can be applied ( aschwanden et al . 1999 ; see appendix a therein for coordinate transformations between the observers reference frame and the loop plane ) .",
    "of course , our example is somehow idealized , in practice there will be confusion by adjacent or intersecting loops , as well as confusion by other radiation mechanisms , such as gyroresonance emission that competes with free - free emission at frequencies of @xmath126 ghz near sunspots .",
    "we can ask whether temperature and density diagnostic of coronal loops is better done in other wavelengths , such as in euv and soft x - rays ( e.g. aschwanden et al .",
    "1999 ) , rather than with radio tomography .",
    "free - free emission in euv and soft x - rays is optically thin , which has the advantage that every loop along a line - of - sight is visible to some extent , while loops in optically thick plasmas can be hidden at radio wavelengths . on the other side ,",
    "the line - of - sight confusion in optically thin plasmas is larger in euv and soft x - rays , in particular if multiple loops along the same line - of - sight have similar temperatures .",
    "different loops along a line - of - sight can only be discriminated in euv and soft x - rays if they have significantly different temperatures , so that they show different responses in lines with different ionization temperatures .",
    "two cospatial loops that have similar temperatures but different widths can not be distinguished by euv or soft x - ray detectors . in radio wavelengths , however , even cospatial loops with similar temperatures , as the two loops in our example in fig.7 ( @xmath118 mk and @xmath122 mk ) , can be separated if they have different widths .",
    "the reason is that they have different critical frequencies @xmath75 where they become resolved , and thus show up as two different peaks in the brightness temperature spectrum @xmath127 .",
    "radio tomography has therefore a number of unique advantages over loop analysis in euv and soft x - ray wavelengths : ( 1 ) a ground - based instrument is much less costly than a space - based instrument , ( 2 ) a wide spectral radio wavelength range ( decimetric , centimetric ) provides straightforwardly diagnostic over a wide temperature range , while an equivalent temperature diagnostic in euv and soft x - rays would require a large number of spectral lines and instrumental filters , ( 3 ) optically thick radio emission is most sensitive to cool plasma , which is undetectable in euv and soft x - rays , except for absorption in the case of very dense cool plasmas , and ( 4 ) radio brightness temperature spectra can discriminate multiple cospatial structures with identical temperatures based on their spatial scale , which is not possible with optically thin euv and soft x - ray emission .",
    "the vertical density and temperature structure of the chromosphere , transition region , and corona has been probed in soft x - rays , euv , and in radio wavelengths , but detailed models that are consistent in all wavelengths are still unavailable .",
    "comprehensive coverage of the multi - thermal and inhomogeneous solar corona necessarily requires either many wavelength filters in soft x - rays and euv , or many radio frequencies , for which fasr will be the optimum instrument .",
    "we illustrate the concept of how to explore the vertical structure of the chromosphere and corona with a few simple examples . we know that the corona is highly inhomogeneous along any line - of - sight ,",
    "so a 3d model has to be composed of a distribution of many magnetic fluxtubes , each one representing a mini - atmosphere with its own density and temperature structure , being isolated from each other due to the low value of the plasma - beta , i.e. @xmath128 . the confusion due to inhomogeneous temperatures and densities is largest for line - of - sights above the limb ( due to the longest column depths with contributing opacity ) , and is smallest for line - of - sights near the solar disk center , where we look down through the atmosphere in vertical direction .    the simplest model of the atmosphere is given by the hydrostatic equilibrium in the isothermal approximation , @xmath129 , where the hydrostatic scale height @xmath130 is proportional to the electron temperature @xmath131 , i.e. @xmath132 with @xmath133 mm for coronal conditions , with @xmath134 the average ion mass ( i.e. @xmath135 for h : he=10:1 ) and @xmath136 the solar gravitation .",
    "the height dependence of the electron density is for gravitational pressure balance , @xmath137   \\ .\\ ] ] where @xmath138 is the base electron density .",
    "this expression for the density @xmath139 can then be inserted into the free - free absorption coefficient @xmath140 , with @xmath129 in the isothermal approximation , @xmath141 \\ , \\ ] ] at disk center , we can set the altitude @xmath21 equal to the line - of - sight coordinate @xmath57 , so that the free - free opacity @xmath142 integrated along the line - of - sight @xmath143 is , @xmath144 and the radio brightness temperature @xmath16 is then @xmath145 with this simple model we can determine the mean temperature @xmath15 by fitting the observed brightness temperature spectra @xmath16 to the theoretical spectra ( eq.15 ) by varying the temperature @xmath129 ( in eqs.13 - 14 ) .",
    "the expected brightness temperature spectra for an isothermal corona with temperatures of @xmath83 mk and @xmath146 mk and a base density of @xmath147 @xmath41 are shown in fig.8 .",
    "we see that the corona becomes optically thin ( @xmath148 ) at frequencies of @xmath149 ghz in this temperature range that is typical for the quiet sun .",
    "these hydrostatic models in the lower corona , however , have been criticized because of the presence of dynamic phenomena , such as spiculae , which may contribute to an extended chromosphere in the statistical average .",
    "the spicular extension of this dynamic chromosphere has been probed with high - resolution measurements of the _ normal incidence x - ray telescope ( nixt ) _ ( daw , deluca , & golub 1995 ) as well as with radio submillimeter observations during a total eclipse ( ewell et al .",
    "1993 ) . using the radio limb height measurements at various mm and sub - mm wavelengths in the range of 200 - 3000 @xmath150 m ( roellig et al . 1991",
    "; horne et al . 1981 ; wannier et al . 1983 ; belkora et al . 1992 ; ewell et al . 1993 ) , an empirical _ caltech irreference chromospheric model ( cicm ) _ was established , which fits the observed limb heights between 500 km and 5000 km in a temperature regime of @xmath151 k to @xmath152 k ( ewell et al .",
    "1993 ) , shown in fig.9 .",
    "we see that these radio limb measurements yield electron densities that are 1 - 2 orders of magnitude higher in the height range of 500 - 5000 km than predicted by hydrostatic models ( val , fal , gabriel 1976 ) , which was interpreted in terms of the dynamic nature of spiculae ( ewell et al .",
    "this enhanced density in the extended chromosphere has also been corroborated with recent _ rhessi _ measurements ( fig.8 ; aschwanden , brown , & kontar 2002 ) .",
    "hard x - rays mainly probe the total neutral and ionized hydrogen density that governs the bremsstrahlung and the total bound and free electron density in collisional energy losses , while the electron density @xmath139 inferred from the radio - based measurements is based on free - free emission , and shows a remarkably good agreement in the height range of @xmath153 km .",
    "the extended chromosphere produces substantially more opacity at microwave frequencies than hydrostatic models ( e.g. gabriel 1976 ) .",
    "the atmospheric structure thus needs to be explored with more general parameterizations of the density @xmath139 and temperature @xmath154 structure than hydrostatic models provide .",
    "for instance , each of the atmospheric models shown in fig.9 provides different functions @xmath139 and @xmath154 .",
    "observational tests of these models can simply be made by forward - fitting of the parameterized height - dependent density @xmath139 and temperature profiles @xmath154 , using the expressions for free - free emission ( eqs.13 - 15 ) . in fig.10",
    "we illustrate this with an example .",
    "the datapoints ( shown as diamonds in fig.10 ) represent radio observations of the solar limb at frequencies of @xmath155 ghz during the solar minimum in 1986 - 87 by zirin , baumert , & hurford ( 1991 ) .",
    "we show in fig.10 an isothermal hydrostatic model for a coronal temperature of @xmath156 mk and a base density of @xmath157 @xmath41 , as well as the hydrostatic model of gabriel ( 1976 ) , of which the density profile @xmath139 is shown in fig.9 .",
    "the gabriel model was calculated based on the expansion of the magnetic field of coronal flux tubes over the area of a supergranule ( canopy geometry ) . the geometric expansion factor and the densities at the lower boundary in the transition region ( given by the chromospheric val and fal models ,",
    "see fig.9 ) then constrains the coronal density model @xmath139 , which falls off exponentially with height in an isothermal fluxtube in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "we see that the gabriel model roughly matches the isothermal hydrostatic model ( see fig.10 ) , but does not exactly match the observations by zirin et al .",
    "however , if we multiply the gabriel model by a factor of 0.4 , to adjust for solar cycle minimum conditions , and add a temperature of @xmath158 k to account for an optically thick chromosphere ( similar to the values determined by bastian , dulk , and leblanc 1996 ) , we find a reasonably good fit to the observations of zirin ( thick curve in fig.10 ) .",
    "this example demonstrates that radio spectra in the frequency range of @xmath159 ghz are quite sensitive to probe the physical structure of the chromosphere and transition region .",
    "with our study we illustrated some basic applications of frequency tomography as can be expected from fasr data .",
    "we demonstrated how physical parameters from coronal loops in active regions , from the quiet - sun corona , and from the chromosphere and transition region can be retrieved . based on these capabilities",
    "we expect that the following science goals can be efficiently studied with future fasr data :    1 .",
    "the electron density @xmath1 and electron temperature profile @xmath2 of individual active region loops can be retrieved , which constrain the heating function @xmath160 along the loop in the momentum and energy balance hydrodynamic equations .",
    "this enables us to test whether a loop is in hydrostatic equilibrium or evolves in a dynamic manner .",
    "detailed dynamic studies of the time - dependent heating function @xmath161 may reveal the time scales of intermittent plasma heating processes , which can be used to constrain whether ac or dc heating processes control energy dissipation .",
    "ultimately , such quantitative studies will lead to the determination and identification of the so far unknown physical heating mechanisms , a long - thought goal of the so - called _ coronal heating problem_. radio diagnostic is most sensitive to cool dense plasma , but is also sensitive continuously up to the highest temperatures , and this way nicely complements euv and soft x - ray diagnostic .",
    "because coronal loops are direct tracers of closed coronal magnetic field lines , the reconstruction of the 3d geometry of loops , as it can be mapped out with multi - frequency data from fasr in a tomographic manner , this information can be used to test theoretical models based on magnetic field extrapolations from the photosphere .",
    "the circular polarization of free - free emission contains additional information on the magnetic field ( grebinskij et al .",
    "2000 ; gelfreikh 2002 ; brosius 2002 ) , as well as gyroresonance emission provides direct measurements of the magnetic field by its proportionality to the gyrofrequency ( lee et al .",
    "1998 ; white 2002 ; ryabov 2002 ) .",
    "ultimately , such studies may constrain the non - potentiality and the localization of currents in the corona . 3 .    the density @xmath139 and temperature profile @xmath154 of the chromosphere , transition region , and corona",
    "can be determined in the quiet sun from brightness temperature spectra @xmath16 , with least confusion at disk center .",
    "parameterized models of the density and temperature structure , additionally constrained by the hydrodynamic equations and differential emission measure distributions , can be forward - fitted to the observed radio brightness temperature spectra @xmath14 .",
    "this provides a new tool to probe physical conditions in the transition region , deviations from hydrostatic equilibria , and diagnostic of dynamic processes ( flows , turbulence , waves , heating , cooling ) in this little understood interface to the corona .",
    "since free - free emission is most sensitive to cool dense plasma , fasr data will also be very suitable to study the origin , evolution , destabilization , and eruption of filaments , which seem to play a crucial role in triggering and onset of _ coronal mass ejections _ ( vourlidas 2002 ) .",
    "ultimately , the information to forecast cmes may be chiefly exploited from the early evolution of filaments .",
    "previous studies with multi - frequency instruments ( vla , ovro , nanay , ratan-600 ) allowed only crude attempts to pioneer tomographic 3d - modeling of the solar corona , because of the limitations of a relatively small number of fourier components and a sparse number of frequencies .",
    "fasr will be the optimum instrument to faciliate 3d diagnostic of the solar corona on a routine basis , which is likely to lead to groundbreaking discoveries in long - standing problems of coronal plasma physics ."
