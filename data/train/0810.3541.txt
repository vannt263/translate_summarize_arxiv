    "to better understand this situation , we examine the line shape of the cross section for @xmath5 hadrons in the energy region from 3.650 to 3.872 gev , measure the line shapes of the @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath4 production and the ratios of the production rates of @xmath6 and @xmath16 in @xmath1 annihilation at @xmath8 resonance , and search for @xmath3 exclusive light hadron final states .",
    "these measurements are made by analyzing about 33 , 6.5 and 1.0 pb@xmath0 of @xmath1 annihilation data sets taken around the center - of - mass energies of @xmath2 3.773 gev , at @xmath2 3.650 gev and at @xmath2 3.6648 gev with the bes - ii detector at the bepc collider .",
