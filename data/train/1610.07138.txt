    "event - by - event distributions of conserved quantities within a limited acceptance are characterized by the moments , such as the mean ( m ) , the standard deviation ( @xmath0 ) , the skewness ( s ) , and the kurtosis ( @xmath1 ) .",

    "particle production at the time of freeze - out in heavy - ion collisions from sis up to lhc energies exhibit thermal characteristics and are well described by the hadron - resonance gas ( hrg ) model @xcite . since the sensitivity to critical dynamics grows with the increasing order , the values of higher - order moments of charge fluctuations can differ significantly from the results of hrg along the freeze - out curve even if lower - order moments agree @xcite .",
    "the hrg model results on moments of charge fluctuations can serve as a theoretical baseline for the analysis of heavy - ion collisions to properly assess the discriminating power of these observables .    in the applications of the hrg model in nucleus - nucleus collisions ,",
    "one prefers to use the grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) which is the most convenient one from the technical point of view , and because of the fact that both the canonical ensemble ( ce ) and microcanonical ensemble ( mce ) are equivalent to the gce in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the applicability of the statistical approach formulated within various statistical ensembles has been considered for average quantities . in the gce ,",
    "chemical potentials and temperature are introduced to control the material and motional conservation on the average , which implies fluctuations around the average from event to event .",
    "the gce can be used when the number of carries of conserved charge is large enough and the fluctuations can be neglected @xcite .",
    "the ce , where the material conservation laws are strictly obeyed , is relevant for systems with a large number of all produced particles , but a small number of carriers of conserved charges like electric charge , baryon number , strangeness or charm @xcite .",
    "this may happen not only in elementary @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 collisions @xcite , but also in @xmath8 or even @xmath9 collisions @xcite .",
    "finally , the mce , where both the motional and material conservation laws are strictly fulfilled , has been used for elementary collisions at low energies where a small number of particles is produced @xcite .    the different statistical ensembles are not equivalent for small systems .",
    "when the system volume increases , the average quantities obtained with the gce , ce , and mce approach each other in the large - volume limit , @xmath10 , which is called the thermodynamical equivalence of the statistical ensembles .",
    "the thermodynamic equivalence , however , means only that the average quantities obtained in different ensembles are equal to each other in the thermodynamic limit , and is not applied to the scaled variance of particle number fluctuations @xcite .",
    "there is a qualitative difference in the properties of the mean multiplicity and the scaled variance of multiplicity distribution in statistical models . expressed in terms of the scaled variance",
    ", the particle number fluctuations have been found to be suppressed in the ce and mce comparing to the gce and this suppression survives in the limit @xmath10 , i.e. , the differences preserved in the thermodynamic limit .",

    ", one is required to study fluctuations in a restricted phase space @xcite .",
    "this is usually fulfilled since there are cuts in rapidity and/or transverse momentum of the detected particles .",
    "the smaller the fraction of observed particles the smaller is the effect of global charge conservation .",
    "however , care has to be taken that these cuts do not destroy the underlying correlations responsible for the physics one tries to access .",
    "data on moments of net - proton , net - kaon and net - charge multiplicity distributions were recently obtained by the star and phenix collaboration in au + au collisions at several collision energies and centralities @xcite .",
    "although no significant deviation from the poisson expectation is observed within uncertainties for net - charge and net - kaon moments products , some pronounced structure is found in the energy dependence of @xmath4 of net - proton distributions from the @xmath11 most central collisions within @xmath12 gev/@xmath13 and at mid - rapidity @xmath14 for energies below 39 gev .",
    "the same measurement becomes close to the poisson expectations when the @xmath15 or rapidity acceptance decreases .",
    "as the collision energy decreases and phase space coverage increases , a larger fraction of the total ( conserved ) charge is observed , and the conservation laws might have some impact on the multiplicity and charge fluctuations .",
