    "the field @xmath1 is almost an order of magnitude less than the threshold electric field of conventional breakdown @xmath2 .",
    "the growth of number of electrons with energies @xmath3mev is determined by the fact that under the action of electric field @xmath4 fast electrons could become runaways , what means that they are accelerated by electric field @xmath5 as suggested by wilson @xcite .",

    "eas are accompanied by a very strong local growth of cosmic ray secondaries number and @xmath12emission in a high energy range @xmath13 .",
    "this flux interacts effectively with thundercloud electric field if runaway breakdown conditions are fulfilled ( rb - eas interaction ) .",
    "the energy obtained by fast electrons from thundercloud electric field due to the rb - eas combined effect can serve for the explosive generation of a very large number of a newborn electrons and gamma quanta ( see accompanying theoretical paper @xcite ) .",

    "* trigger data requisition . *",
    "the shower trigger array ( so as the whole `` thunderstorm '' detector system ) has several data registration centers connected with each other and with the trigger detector subsystems by the means of cable lines .",
    "topology of the data transfer cables is shown in fig .",
    "[ lay ] .",
    "one of the registration centers  the main center  has a cable connection also with the system of radio emission registration ; it is the same place where the common shower trigger signal is elaborated from coincidence signals of separate elementary triangles .",
    "the common trigger signal is transmitted to the radio registration system through the special cable ; in the moment of its appearance information about the coincidence type ( namely , identifiers of the all detector points whose pulses were coinciding with the trigger ) is written by a registration computer .",
    "later these data are used to estimate roughly the size of a registered shower .",
    "all the detector points of subsystem _ i _ ( it is also denoted as _ center _ in fig .  [ lay ] ) have a direct connection with the main registration point and their pulses are transmitted to that point immediately .",
    "this circumstance permits to analyze the trigger coincidence type in particularly and to define precisely the intensity of _ abc _ , _ bce _ , _ cde _ and _ def _ triggers coming from the _ center _ trigger subsystem .",
    "the signals of the subsystem _ ii _ are analyzed in the peripheral registration point and just the ready coincidence pulses from its basic triangles _",
    "g _ and _ h _ are transmitted to the main center ( see fig .  [ lay ] ) .    in the main registration center",
    "any combination of the _ abc _ , _ bce _ , _ cde _ , _ def _ , _ g _ , _ h _ signals is used to generate a common trigger pulse for radio emission registration system .",
    "the trigger signal is formed as a coincidence of signals within @xmath20s duration from every three modulus connected in a triangle ( abc for example ) .",
    "that is why the trigger time accuracy of the array is @xmath20s .",
    "its stability was tested with a precision scintillation counter .",
    "* calibration of the array during quiet time *    during quiet time ( not thunderstorm days ) trigger array was carefully calibrated .",
    "it was established that in average the full array was registering a shower every 2.45 second ( fig .  [ evnum ] ) .",
    "calibration was proved by measurements at triangle abc done simultaneously by sig5 g and scintillation counter counters .",
    "a detailed numerical simulations was fulfilled , which demonstrated a reasonable agreement with observations .",
    "it will be shown below that the work of a trigger system in thunderstorm period ( which is of our interest ) and in quiet days _ is significantly different_. that is why the detailed description of a quiet time array calibration is omitted here .",
    "it will be presented in a separate paper .",
    "* receiving antennas *    radio measurements were carried out using specially designed installation ( analogous to described in @xcite ) for short electromagnetic pulse observations in the frequency range from 0.1 to 30 mhz .",
    "this installation contains three spaced receiving antennas connected to the receiving apparatus ( central unit ) .",
    "it allows signal arrival angle determination using correlation technique as well as waveform recording with high temporal resolution ( 16 ns ) .",
    "its block diagram is shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig : instr ] .",
    "each receiving antenna of the installation ( antenna assembly ) actually consists of three individual antennas  two mutually perpendicular loop antennas for horizontal magnetic field measurements , and an end - fed antenna to measure vertical electric field .",
    "all three antennas are active and include transistor amplifiers .",
    "this allowed to reduce the size of the assembly essentially and to reach uniform gain - frequency characteristics for all antennas in the wide frequency range .",
    "antenna for magnetic field measurements is a screened vertically sited rectangular loop .",
    "loop and prime amplifier screening is needed to provide antenna sensitivity only to magnetic field , in other case its directional pattern becomes non - symmetric and frequency dependent . to equalize frequency - response of the loop",
    "it should be loaded by small resistance .",
    "thus it is attached to the amplifier input through a step - up transformer made on long lines working as current transformer .",
    "electric antenna is an electrically short rod attached to the matched transistor amplifier .",
    "its frequency - response equalization is achieved using principally capacitate character of the electrically short pole impedance as well as of transistor input impedance in the frequency range concerned .",
    "so , antenna  amplifier connection is a frequency independent divider with a ratio of antenna capacity to amplifier capacity as a transfer coefficient .",
    "antenna capacity is increased by a plate tip at the end of the rod to increase the transfer coefficient .",
    "the increase of antenna capacity extends the antenna frequency range to lower frequencies also .",
    "low boundary of the antenna frequency range is determined by the response time that is equal to the product of the antenna capacity and an input resistance of the amplifier .",
    "high input resistance of the amplifier leads to the growth of low frequency noise and assigns a risk of input transistor damage due to breakdown in strong electric fields .",
    "therefore the input resistance was chosen in accordance with low boundary of the antenna frequency range ( 100 khz approximately ) to be about 1  mohm .",
    "breakdown protection of the amplifier is provided in three stages by high - voltage feed - through capacitor , gas - filled excess voltage preventer , and two parallel - opposition semiconductor diodes successively mounted at its input .",
    "* data registration and storage *    all three antenna amplifiers outputs from each antenna assembly are connected to the central unit by coaxial cables of equal lengths .",
    "separate cables are used to provide antenna amplifiers power supply through appropriate bypasses .",
    "the central unit provides switching and selection up to 4 receiving elements ( antennas ) most suitable under specific conditions of the experiment .",
    "it serves also for preliminary analog data reduction , namely , reduction of the dynamic range of received signals to analog - to - digital converter ( adc ) input range to prevent loss of information , and both high - pass and low - pass filtering to decrease low - frequency noise and to prevent spectral aliasing during data sampling .    after the central unit chosen signals are digitized by 4-channel radio receiver based on the personal computer ( pc ) using two synchronized two - channel adc boards with sampling rate up to 60 mhz and 256 mb per board internal memory .",
    "high sampling rate leads to high data traffic that exceeds the ability of pc bus .",
    "therefore pulse operation mode is needed with fast data storage into internal buffer area following by slower data transfer to the pc initiated by trigger pulse .",
    "adc internal buffer memory allows to record up to 1 second sessions with maximum sampling rate of 60 mhz .",
    "radio receiver is operated in the pretrigger mode allowing signal recording before and after the trigger pulse",
    ". it can be triggered by external ttl signal as well as internally . in the last case triggering occurred when an input signal of one of the adc channels exceeds a preset threshold .",
    "the whole installation is supplied by ups ( uninterruptible power supply ) with enhanced up to several hours off - line operation capability ( using external accumulator of higher capacity ) .",
    "antenna units ( assemblies ) are mounted at the tien shan scientific station at the altitude of about 3340 m above the sea level .",
    "they form direct angle triangle with perpendicular bases of about 78 m in the @xmath21 azimuth direction with elevation angle of @xmath22 ( below the horizon ) and about 74 m in the @xmath23 azimuth direction with elevation angle of @xmath24 ( above the horizon ) .",
    "an additional receiver operated at about 250 mhz is used as a separate facility to observe vhf radiation from the lightning .",
    "this receiver has filter bandwidth of 6 mhz , its output is detected with time constant of 100 @xmath25s or 10 @xmath25s providing correspondent time resolution .",
    "its data acquisition system can also record eas trigger pulses and static electric field using additional channels .",
    "_ quiet time _    observations were carried out from july 19 till october 09 , 2003 almost continuously .",
    "the radio receiving system was triggered by the eas facility .",
    "mean time interval between triggers was about 10 s in the beginning of observations decreasing later to 2.45 s due to upgrade of eas facility and enhancement of its effective area ( fig .",
    "[ evnum ] ) .",
    "recording time was slightly above 100 @xmath25s with 83.2 @xmath25s pre - history .",
    "data sampling rate of 60 mhz was used .",
    "short radio pulses with few hundred nanosecond length correspondent to eas s were searched .",
    "wide band radio interferometer in frequency range 0.1  30 mhz was used in our experiment .",
    "the electromagnetic noise in this frequency range is always rather strong .",
    "the radio noise spectrum has well defined maximum of the order or less than 0.2 mhz .",
    "this frequency is small compared with the frequency of registered signals ( @xmath26 mhz ) .",
    "that s why only noise intensity is significant .",
    "it is shown in fig .",

    "it was established that the radio pulse is generated by unipolar current pulse and its form , width and amplitude agree with the predictions of rb - eas interaction theory @xcite .",
