    "it is well known , that even at absolute zero , whereas the total energy of the condensate is constant , the kinetic energy of a vortex structure can decrease @xcite due to the generation of sound . in assessing the finite - temperature damping , we shall therefore isolate the transformation of kinetic energy into sound energy .",
    "we solve numerically the following two - dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) which governes the time evolution of the order parameter , @xmath3 = @xmath4 : + @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the position , t is the time ,    @xmath7    and    @xmath8    are respectively the density and the velocity .",

    "the chemical potential , which can be initially estimated as    @xmath42    from the thomas - fermi solution of the dimensionless _ gpe _ , is found by the single - step integration :    @xmath43    after the initial thomas - fermi solution has relaxed to a time - independent solution in the harmonic trap , where @xmath44 denotes spatial average .",
