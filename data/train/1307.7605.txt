    "the origin of glass transition and the stability of a supercooled liquid against crystallization is still not well understood and is an open question @xcite .",
    "it is usually found that during fast cooling due to a large change in viscosity , crystallization can be avoided and the system is vitrified .",
    "the vitrified materials are tougher , stronger and have large strain limits .",
    "when compared to their crystalline counterparts these glassy materials can be easily used to prepare homogeneous , isotropic solids in large dimensions .",
    "although vitrification is desirable but not all supercooled systems form glasses , many undergo crystallization .",
    "thus it is important to understand the origin of stability of supercooled liquids against crystallization . in the metallic glass community",
    "some empirical rules are used based on the analysis of glass forming ability ( gfa ) of metallic alloys @xcite .",
    "the rules state that i ) the system should have more than three components , ii ) the size ratio between the components should be about 12 % , and iii ) the enthalpy of mixing should be negative . although having more than three components is a desirable criteria for gfa but some binary metallic alloys are also known to form glasses @xcite .",
    "one such glass former ni@xmath3p@xmath4 has been the motivation behind the development of a well known model system , known as the kob - anderson ( ka ) model @xcite .",
    "this model system has been extensively used in computer simulation studies of supercooled liquids @xcite .",
    "the ka model has never been found to crystallize except for one case @xcite .",
    "however , the origin of its stability against crystallization is not fully understood @xcite .",
    "there are some frustration based approaches to explain the stability of supercooled liquids @xcite .",
    "the role of frustration in supercooling has been invoked first by frank @xcite .",
    "he has pointed out that the local icosahedral ordering of liquid although can not be spanned in space , is locally more stable than crystal ordering .",
    "the crystal ordering wins over only because it becomes economical when spanned over long range .",
    "thus when a liquid is cooled it requires substantial costly rearrangement of molecules to crystallize and this slows down the crystallization process and promotes supercooling below the melting point .",
    "et al _ have proposed a frustration theory to connect the slow dynamics in the system to the local preferred structure ( lps ) @xcite . according to their theory",
    ", the liquid will prefer to freeze in the locally preferred liquid structure ( icosahedral for lennard - jones ( lj ) liquids ) which is different from the crystal structure . since the local structure can not tile the ordinary three dimensional space , in trying to do so",
    "the liquid will be geometrically frustrated and will break up into domains .",
    "the rearrangement in these domains gives rise to the slow dynamics and glass transition .",
    "a different picture of frustration has been proposed by tanaka and co - workers @xcite .",
    "according to their theory , liquid - glass transition is connected to crystallization @xcite .",
    "they have proposed that there is frustration between short range bond ordering to form lps and long range density ordering which gives rise to crystal structure .",
    "this frustration leads to gfa of a system .",
    "thus it is obvious that the origin and the role of frustration are different in all these different studies .    as mentioned before the ka model has been extensively used to study the dynamics of supercooled liquids because of its stability against crystallization .",
    "there has been a large number of studies by different groups , devoted to the understanding of the kinetics of crystallization @xciteand also the stability of crystal phases @xcite .",
    "these studies have been performed for not only ka model , but in general for the binary lj mixture .",
    "fernandez and harrowell have performed crystal phase analysis of binary lj for different inter - species interaction length and also for different compositions @xcite .",
    "their study has revealed that for the ka model at t=0 the most stable equilibrium structure is a coexistence between ab ( cscl ) crystal and pure a ( fcc ) crystal with a coherent ( 001 ) interface .",
    "they have also suggested that the crystal growth of ka model might be frustrated because of the competition between the growth of ab ( cscl form ) and a ( fcc form ) structures @xcite . according to them this frustration might be the origin of stability of the ka model .",
    "et al . _ have studied the binary lj mixture at different compositions @xcite .",
    "they claim that for the compositions where the system undergoes amorphization they find either cscl type or fcc - hcp type crystal seeds in the liquid .",
    "thus they predict that since both the structures do not coexist there is no competition between these two type of crystal growth .",
    "_ have pointed out that negative mixing enthalpy or energy leads to the system to be stable supercooled mixtures @xcite .",
    "et al . _ have done isolated stable cluster analysis of the preferred coordination of a atoms around the smaller b atoms for both @xmath5 ( ka model ) which is known not to crystallize , and for @xmath6 which quite easily forms a cscl type interpenetrating bcc crystal structure @xcite .",
    "they found that for @xmath5 the structures are related to the square anti - prism .",
    "similar structures were also found to be present in the local structure analysis of supercooled ka liquid @xcite .",
    "have also found that for @xmath6 stable structure is the cscl type crystal .",
    "equimolar binary lj systems for different inter - species interaction lengths ( @xmath7 ) are also known to crystallize in different forms depending on the @xmath7 values @xcite .    in this study we explore the interplay between crystallization and supercooling for a number of binary lj mixtures at various compositions and inter - species interaction lengths described by @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "we have used the local bond orientational order ( boo ) parameters and the local coordination number to identify the locally preferred structures and crystal structures .",
    "recently the local boo parameters have been extensively used by tanaka and coworkers to study properties of not only crystals but also supercooled liquids @xcite .",
    "the systems studied here have all negative enthalpy of mixing and the size ratio between the two components are kept fixed at 12@xmath10 . in this range of systems",
    "we have found that some easily crystallize and some remain in supercooled liquid state .",
    "the focus of this study is to understand : i ) the origin of this variation in the crystallization behaviour and ii ) the origin of stability against crystallization in terms of frustration between two crystal forms and also the frustration between the lps and the global structure .",
    "the simulation details are given in the next section . in section 3",
    "we have the results and discussion , and section 4 ends with a brief summary .",
    "we have performed molecular dynamics study with composition variation and interaction length variation .",

    "however when we compare the local boo for all of these systems we find that as we increase the @xmath8 the distribution becomes broader suggesting crystalline frustration . at @xmath44",

    "the b particles although do not show any fcc ordering as would have been expected for nacl type crystal but the local boo of the a particles around the b particles show sc characteristic similar to that found for nacl type crystal . also the lattice spacing between the a particles are larger than that found for pure fcc crystal and similar to that found for nacl type structure .",
    "thus we believe the absence of fcc ordering between the b particles is only due to the fact that they are lesser in number and scattered over the full system .",
    "we would assume that this system has nacl + fcc type crystal ordering with some defects .",
    "as reported by fernandez and harrowell for the equimolar mixture we too find that it is difficult to crystallize the system for @xmath53 @xcite .",

    "this led us to conclude that for @xmath53 equimolar mixture ( @xmath6 ) is more frustrated . in our study",
    "we also found that the drop in the enthalpy at crystallization is directly related to the width of the distribution of the local boo and thus to frustration .",
    "the larger the drop the narrower is the local boo distribution .",
    "however , the most interesting result here is that for @xmath5 we do not find any crystallization for @xmath55s@xmath47 ( fig-[composition_phase_plot ] ) .",
    "although for s@xmath56 and s@xmath57 we do find a drop in energy but the local boo does not show any crystal ordering .",
    "note that this range of @xmath8 , except for s@xmath56 , exactly coincides with the appearance of the cscl crystal for @xmath6 . as reported by fernandez and harrowell in this range",
    "the lowest energy state is a combination of cscl+fcc crystal structure @xcite .",
    "this is quite expected because as we increase the number of a particles the excess a particles would like to form fcc type crystal and the ab mixture would like to form cscl ( bcc ) type crystal , similar to that found for the range @xmath58s@xmath59 where nacl+fcc lattice is formed .",
    "however the inability of these systems to crystallize led us to believe that the stability of the supercooled liquid in this range of @xmath8 is related to the difficulty of nucleation of bcc type crystals .",
    "this difficulty in nucleation can be due to the frustration between fcc and bcc crystal formation as has been suggested by fernandez and harrowell @xcite or it can due to frustration between the lps and both fcc and bcc crystal structures . in order to understand this in greater detail we have further studied one of the systems , @xmath60 , in the range @xmath61 .",
    "note that @xmath62 and @xmath60 represents the well known ka model .    according to the lattice energy study",
    "as we change the composition and increase the number of a type particles the lowest energy state of the system is expected to have a mixture of pure a fcc type crystal and mixed cscl type crystal @xcite .",
    "since the local boos ( both @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) for fcc and bcc type crystals have very similar values ( see table-1 ) it becomes difficult to identify the presence of both the structures unless the ordering is sharply peaked at the respective local boo values .",
    "however , if we consider only the a particles , then they are expected to have both fcc and sc ordering if the system is a mixture of fcc and cscl type of crystal .",
    "the local boo of the fcc and sc are well separated , particularly in the @xmath63 value ( see table-1 )",
    ". thus monitoring the a - a local boo parameters enables us to observe the signature of both the crystalline forms in one system and also the transition from one form to another across the systems .",
    "similar to that observed for @xmath65 , the @xmath66 ( for @xmath67 ) system also undergoes a cscl type of crystallization .    for the composition of @xmath68 , crystallization has not been observed .",
    "we have simulated a five times bigger system to rule out any system size dependence and also used parallel tempering method @xcite .",
    "but the system did not undergo crystallization in any of these cases , even for a trajectory length of 10@xmath30 .",
    "leocmach and tanaka have shown that the distribution of the local boo in a liquid at low temperature can also provide information about the tendency of the system to undergo a certain form of crystallization @xcite .",

    "this lower value might help the rearrangement of the neighbours between the neighbouring a and b particles to form a bcc seed where the a particle can give away one of its extra neighbour to the neighbouring b particle . in case of @xmath5",
    "we find that the @xmath73 peak has shifted to n=8 but at the same time the @xmath74 peak has shifted to n=8 which is away from the n=6 value required for a cscl structure or n=12 required for the fcc structure .",
    "thus even if the b particles have required neighbours the surrounding a particles have more a neighbours than that required for the formation of the cscl type crystal",
    ". it will require large rearrangement of neighbours between the a particles to form bimodal distribution of its neighbours with peaks at n=6 and n=12 .",
    "thus this locally preferred structure does not allow the formation of either cscl type crystal between ab particles or fcc crystal between the aa particles .",
    "for the composition of @xmath5 the @xmath74 distribution moves further away from the n=6 value .",

    "we plot the @xmath73 values and @xmath74 values for both the systems in their liquid and crystalline states ( fig-4a , fig-4b ) .",
    "we notice that in all the cases the @xmath73 peaks at n=6 and @xmath74 peaks at n=12 . this should be true for all the other intermediate compositions also . since for both nacl and fcc crystal the @xmath74 needs to peak at n=12 thus the coordination number around a a particle does not require much rearrangement for the system to crystallize .",
    "this shows that there is less frustration between the lps and the nacl+fcc crystal .",
    "this is precisely where the cscl+fcc and nacl+fcc crystal differ from each other .",

    "thus it is imperative to understand the tendency of crystallization of the * bcc zone * to form any of these two types of fcc crystal . in order to do that we study the melting of the disordered fcc crystal ( formed for @xmath49 ) and nacl+fcc crystal ( formed for @xmath84 ) by varying the @xmath8 value .",
    "we start with the crystalline structures obtained for the system with @xmath84 and @xmath49 for @xmath5 .",
    "the systems are first cooled to @xmath86 and then these structures are taken as a reference structure for different @xmath8 values @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the local boo parameter obtained for the nacl+fcc structure with @xmath60 is similar to that obtained for the mka model of toxvaerd _ et al .",
    "this shows that the nacl+fcc structure is where the mka model crystallizes and the ka is expected to crystallize .",
    "the @xmath87 phase diagram clearly shows that the stability of any form of fcc type crystal is less in the * bcc zone*. in our study we could not predict a triple point as in the range @xmath88 none of the crystal forms were found to be stable even at @xmath86 ( fig-[phase_plot_temp ] ) .",
    "the energy per particle at t=0 and p=0 for the ka model in this nacl+fcc structure was found to be -7.291 which is higher than the energy per particle for the amorphous state reported earlier ( -7.72 ) @xcite .",

    "the systems studied here have negative enthalpy of mixing and the size ratio between the components are always kept 12% . for the range of @xmath8",
    "studied here the equimolar mixture crystallizes into three different forms of crystals similar to that found by vlot _",

    "although the systems with small and large @xmath8 values crystallize to nacl+fcc and hcp + fcc crystal , respectively , the bcc zone does not crystallize .",
    "this shows that the frustration against crystallization has a connection with the formation of bcc crystal structure .",
    "the study with @xmath27 at different compositions gives further insight to this frustration .",

    "the lps does not favour either of the crystal form .",
    "however the lps for @xmath5 shows a tendency towards fcc crystal formation .",
    "thus we can claim that as the composition of a particle increases , the nucleation barrier to form a bcc crystal also increases .",
    "this conclusion is coherent with the finding of fernandez and harrowell .",
    "they have reported that even after putting a bcc seed in a the ka mixture they have not found the growth of bcc crystal @xcite .",
    "this must also be the reason why toxvaerd _",
    "_ could form a mixed fcc + bcc phase in the ka mixture only after putting the complete bcc structure and allowing the growth of fcc lattice around it @xcite .",
    "however , valdes _",
    "et al . _ have reported that for @xmath89 the low temp state of the system seems to be composed of bcc+fcc crystalline structure @xcite .",
    "this shows that instead of increasing the bigger particles if we increase the composition of smaller particles then nucleation barrier for bcc crystalline structure will reduce",
    ". it will be interesting to perform a free energy calculation of the nucleation barrier for bcc crystal formation at different compositions similar to that performed for other systems @xcite .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present work and would be taken as a future project .",
    "since the lps for @xmath5 shows a fcc characteristic , we have also studied the phase diagram of the melting temperature of two different fcc types of crystal forms which are present for the higher and lower @xmath8 values .",
    "the study shows that the phase diagram has a v - shape where the bcc zone which does not crystallize sits at the bottom of the v. this v - shaped phase diagram has also been observed earlier for si - like system and also for water - licl system .",
    "it has been always found that due to frustration between the lps and the global structure , the systems sitting at the bottom of the v are good glass formers .",
    "although we have not studied the phase diagram by varying the composition , but the local boo and cn analysis predicts a similar v - shaped phase diagram where at @xmath6 the system forms bcc type crystal and the pure monoatomic system ( @xmath90 ) forms fcc type crystal . for the intermediate values of @xmath0 where the crystal structure analysis shows that the mixture of fcc+cscl is the global structure , the analysis of the lps shows that there is a frustration between the lps and the global structure .",
    "thus the picture suggests that the intermediate @xmath0 values will be sitting at the bottom of the v and the @xmath65 and @xmath90 will be forming the two ends .",
    "hence the bcc zone for composition of @xmath5 is a good glass former not only due to the frustration between the two different fcc lattice structures but also due to the frustration between the lps and fcc+bcc lattice formation .",
    "our study suggests that whenever we increase the composition of one of the species of a binary system which in its equimolar composition forms bcc crystal ( cscl type ) we will find a frustration between the lps and global structure . in more general terms if a global structure of a mixed system has two crystalline forms such that any of the species which is present in both the crystal structures has a large difference in its order parameter ( coordination number or local boo or any other order parameter ) in the two crystal forms , there will be frustration between the lps and the global structure .",
    "the lps will not be closer to either of the crystalline states and this frustration will lead to the stability of the system against crystallization .",
