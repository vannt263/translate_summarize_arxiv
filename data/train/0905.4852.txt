    "the transport in josephson junctions with various different materials constituting the normal region has been a very active research field for decades now and continues to be one . among the many interesting transport properties of josephson junctions are the so - called subharmonic gap structure ( sgs ) and the excess current , both of which were accurately explained by the concept of multiple andreev reflections ( mar ) .",
    "the mar theory was first formulated for normal  superconducting ( ns ) interfaces by blonder , tinkham , and klapwijk ( btk ) @xcite and the btk theory and its extensions ( especially to the ferromagnetic or non - bcs superconducting contacts ) are still actively used in fitting experiments @xcite and in theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "the btk theory was then extended to full sns junctions by octavio , tinkham , blonder and klapwijk ( otbk ) @xcite and flensberg , bindslev hansen and octavio @xcite .",

    "this assumption breaks down for sufficiently small systems such as , e.g. , atomic wires and the fully coherent approach developed in mid 90 s @xcite is applicable instead .",
    "nevertheless , the otbk theory describes certain systems , such as microbridges , very well and keeps on being used in the literature both in experimental @xcite as well as theoretical @xcite studies .",

    "we analytically study the excess current in the otbk theory .",
    "although the excess current has been derived analytically in more recent coherent theories @xcite it has not been reported yet in an analytic form in the older incoherent otbk approach .",
    "we fill in this gap and provide the analytical derivation of the excess current for incoherent generally asymmetric sns junctions described by the otbk theory .",

    "( 30 ) ) and the negativity of the excess current was interpreted as possibly stemming from a lack of convergence of the numerical study , i.e.from not reaching the true @xmath155 limit .",
    "our study clearly demonstrates that this objection can not hold since we explicitly work in the required limit , thus avoiding any finite-@xmath156 issues .",
    "we , however , do not question the presence of non - trivial issues in the experimental determination of the excess current related to the finite voltage and possible heating effects nicely reviewed and discussed in ref .",
    "apparently , observations of negative excess current ( so called deficit current ) have been reported in experiments @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we analytically prove the correctness of the old numerical results @xcite predicting negative excess current within the otbk theory . the discrepancy with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite then must stem from the difference of the two considered models , more specifically , the role of internal coherence of the junction . while the otbk theory only considers matching of the distribution functions between the two interfaces corresponding to fully incoherent junctions , the hamiltonian theory of ref .",
    "@xcite matches the wavefunctions throughout the whole junction thus fully retaining the coherence within the junction .",
    "the high - voltage properties of the two models differ even qualitatively , one predicting negative excess current for small transparencies , the other one not .",
    "another qualitative difference between otbk and the fully coherent theory is in their dependence on the junction asymmetry : while the fully coherent results in the limit of strong coherent coupling to the leads ( @xmath157 , relevant for many experiments , e.g.@xcite ) only depend on the asymmetry through the total junction resistance @xcite , it is not so in the otbk case as we can immediately see from our result for the excess current ( eq .  ( [ eq : asymiexc_final ] ) ) which is _ not _ a function of @xmath158 only .",
    "this finding shows that the coherence within the junction plays a crucial role for the superconducting transport even at finite voltage bias and therefore the level of decoherence / dephasing within a junction should be carefully considered when describing a particular experiment .",
    "this effect , i.e.nonzero dephasing within the junction , may be responsible for the experimentally observed discrepancies between the experiments @xcite and theoretical predictions @xcite systematically reported recently in josephson junctions made of carbon nanotubes . while those discrepancies are currently interpreted as the superconducting gap renormalization this picture does not seem to be fully consistent with the positions of the subharmonic gap structure features , which appear at the positions determined by the un - renormalized gap value .",
    "the dephasing picture could capture the relevant physical mechanism instead although this remains an open issue in the currently booming field of superconducting transport in carbon - allotropes - based josephson junctions .",
    "apart from the obvious usage of our newly derived analytical formulae for the otbk excess current to fit experiments for relatively large and thus fully incoherent junctions , they can also be used as a limit benchmark of future partially - coherent theories , possibly relevant for current nanoscale experiments .",
    "these experiments as well as future devices built from novel low dimensional materials with peculiar electronic structures , such as graphene nanoribbons , could realistically be described by existing dephasing approaches for atomistic models @xcite coupled to non - equilibrium transport .",
    "the development of such a partially - coherent theory and the analytical evaluation of its excess current interpolating between the two limits is our next step .",
