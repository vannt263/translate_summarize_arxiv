    "<S> a very good agreement is obtained for temperatures down to 0.2@xmath0 . below the kondo temperature @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> the inverse of the phase coherence time varies linearly with temperature over almost one decade in temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> the kondo problem has been fascinating physicist for more than 30 years . </S>",
    "<S> such a large interest is due to the fact that this model , first introduced to describe transport properties of metals containing magnetic impurities , is a generic model for the description of many solid state physics phenomena@xcite . concerning magnetic alloys , the `` historical '' kondo solution first allowed to describe the transport properties at temperatures larger than the characteristic temperature of the model , the kondo temperature @xmath1@xcite . the major breakthrough has been the pioneering work of wilson who was able to calculate the ground state of the kondo problem at all temperatures using his numerical renormalisation group ( nrg)@xcite . another important contribution was due to nozires who showed that the zero temperature limit of the kondo model can be described within landau s fermi liquid theory@xcite which made precise predictions for transport as well as thermodynamic properties . </S>",
    "<S> since then , many experiments have confirmed the relevance of this approach .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , it has been suggested that scattering by magnetic impurities@xcite is responsible for the experimentally observed saturation of the phase coherence time of electrons in metals at low temperatures@xcite , renewing the interest in kondo physics . though the altshuler - aronov - khmelnitzky ( aak ) theory describes the temperature dependence of the phase coherence time of electrons in pure metals@xcite , no exact solution is available for the phase coherence time in the presence of kondo impurities . </S>",
    "<S> only a high temperature expansion , the nagaoka - suhl ( ns ) expression , was able to describe the experimental data at temperatures @xmath2@xcite . in the opposite limit ( @xmath3 ) , </S>",
    "<S> fermi liquid theory predicts a @xmath4 dependence of the inelastic scattering rate@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this , however , has never been observed experimentally . only very recently , </S>",
    "<S> zarnd and coworkers have been able to obtain an exact solution for the inelastic scattering time in kondo metals using wilson s nrg@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this calculation constitutes a major breakthrough for the decoherence problem , as it allows to compare experimental data with theoretical results _ for all temperatures , ranging from well above @xmath1 down to zero temperature_. it is thus of crucial importance to check whether this theory can describe correctly experimental data , as it could give new insights into the problem of the low temperature decoherence in mesoscopic metallic wires .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we compare this recent theory with experimental results and show that the nrg calculation describes very well the experimental data at temperatures around and below the kondo temperature . in the first part of this letter we analyze the phase coherence time of quasi one - dimensional gold wires containing magnetic iron impurities of ref.@xcite , denoted as aufe1 and ref.@xcite , denoted as aufe2 , whereas in the second part we use the nrg calculation to interpret the phase coherence time as a function of temperature of an extremely pure gold sample ( au1 ) . in table </S>",

    "<S> both samples display a distinct plateau at a temperature above @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> this plateau is caused by kondo spin flip scattering due to the presence of iron impurities which leads to dephasing . </S>",
    "<S> decreasing the temperature , the magnetic impurity spin is screened and as a result , the phase coherence time increases again .    </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the measured phase coherence time in the presence of magnetic impurities can be described in the following way @xmath32 where @xmath33^{2/3 } </S>",

    "<S> sample aufe1 of ref.@xcite , @xmath43 sample aufe2 ( sample b ) of ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the green dotted line ( denoted aak ) corresponds to the assumption that only electron - electron and electron - phonon interaction contribute to dephasing . </S>",
    "<S> the black dashed - dotted lines ( ns1 and ns2 ) take in addition account for the magnetic scattering using the ns expression , whereas for the red ( nrg1 ) and blue ( nrg2 ) solid lines , the nrg calculation has been employed for the contribution of the magnetic impurities . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows 1/versus t on a linear scale for sample aufe2 in order to emphasize the _ linear _ regime.,width=257 ]    the green dotted line in figure[nrg ] , denoted as aak , corresponds to the assumption that only electron - electron and electron - phonon interaction contribute to the electron dephasing and that there is no other mechanism for decoherence at low temperatures . for the simulation we have used @xmath44 and @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> keeping these values fixed , and adding the contribution due to magnetic impurities using the ns expression for s=1/2 , we obtain the black dashed - dotted lines for sample aufe1 and aufe2 , denoted as ns1 and ns2 . </S>",
    "<S> the ns expression describes relatively well the observed temperature dependence of at temperatures above @xmath0 but fails to describe the desaturation of due to the screening of the magnetic impurities at temperatures @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> this is not at all surprising since the ns expression results from a perturbative expansion in @xmath47 and breaks down for @xmath48 . instead , </S>",
    "<S> taking the inelastic scattering rate obtained by nrg we obtain a very good agreement with the experimental data in basically the entire temperature range as shown by the red ( nrg1 ) and blue ( nrg2 ) solid lines for sample aufe1 and aufe2 , respectively . for the fitting procedure </S>",
    "<S> , we have adjusted the magnetic impurity concentration such that the ns expression and the nrg calculation coincide at high temperatures ( @xmath49 ) . </S>",
    "<S> one clearly sees that the ns expression deviates already from the nrg data at relatively high temperatures ( @xmath50 ) as already pointed out in ref.@xcite and fitting of experimental data with this expression at temperatures @xmath51 should therefore be avoided . from the nrg fitting procedure </S>",
    "<S> we obtain an impurity concentration of approximately 3.3ppm and @xmath52 for sample aufe1 and 45ppm and @xmath53 for sample aufe2@xcite , in good agreement with @xmath0 values for au / fe found in the literature@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth mentioning that the measurement of the phase coherence time is a very precise method to determine the kondo temperature as well as the magnetic impurity concentration . in resistance measurements , </S>",
    "<S> the determination of the kondo temperature is not straightforward since the entire temperature range down to the unitary limit ( @xmath54 is necessary to extract the kondo temperature with a satisfactory precision . </S>",
    "<S> the nrg fitting procedure of on the contrary allows to extract the kondo temperature with high precision if temperatures only slightly lower than @xmath0 are attained .    at the lowest temperatures we observe deviations from the nrg theory . a probable explanation for the deviation is fact that the spin of fe in au is not exactly 1/2 and the impurity spin might not be completely screened . </S>",
    "<S> this eventually leads to interactions of magnetic impurities and a saturation of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility is the presence of another magnetic impurity with a much lower kondo temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this latter issue will be discussed in the last part of this article .    </S>",
    "<S> the temperature evolution of below @xmath0 deserves several comments : after a slow increase of the temperature dependence is almost _ linear _ in temperature over almost one decade in temperature , as emphasized in the inset of figure [ nrg ] . </S>",
    "<S> this relatively weak temperature dependence explains the fact why the pioneering experiments@xcite have not succeeded to observe the fermi liquid regime . comparing the experimental results with the nrg calculation </S>",
    "<S> , we clearly see that the fermi liquid regime can only be reached for temperatures typically below @xmath55 </S>",
    "<S> . moreover , the aak behaviour is only recovered at extremely low temperatures ( @xmath56 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy , that the calculated quantity by nrg is @xmath57 and not the phase coherence time measured in a weak localization experiment . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , @xmath57 has been calculated in the limit of zero temperature and finite energy @xmath58 , whereas in a transport experiment one measures @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the numerical results describe this well the experimental data let us conclude that these two quantities are not very different , at least for @xmath60 , @xmath61 being the fermi energy .     for different bias currents . </S>",
    "<S> the dotted line corresponds to the theoretical expectation for the resistance correction . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows a sem photograph of the gold wire.,width=264 ]    having now a theory which satisfactorily describes the temperature dependence of in the presence of magnetic impurities , let us reexamine the temperature dependence of in extremely pure gold wires . in a recent article@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the deviation of from the aak prediction at very low temperatures has been assigned to the presence of an extremely small amount of magnetic impurities ( typically on the order of 0.01ppm ) . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose we have fabricated an extremely pure gold wire ( au1 ) as shown in the inset of figure [ r_t ] . </S>",
    "<S> the fabrication procedure is essentially the same as for the au / fe wires with the only difference that the wire has been evaporated in an evaporator which is exclusively used for the evaporation of extremely pure gold . </S>",
    "<S> the gold of purity 5n5 has been evaporated directly on a silicon wafer @xmath62 a sticking layer . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , special care has been taken for the sample design such that there is no influence on the phase coherence due to the two dimensional contact pads ( see inset of figure 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> for this wire the phase coherence length at the lowest temperatures is more than @xmath63 . to our knowledge , this is the largest coherence length ever obtained in a metallic wire and confirms the high purity of the sample .    to determine the effective electron temperature of this sample </S>",
    "<S> , we have measured the altshuler - aronov correction to the resistivity at very low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> a magnetic field of 40mt has been applied in order to suppress weak localization correction to the resistivity . in figure [ r_t ] </S>",
    "<S> we plot the resistance correction as a function of @xmath64 . for measuring currents below 0.7na , </S>",
    "<S> the sample is in thermal equilibrium ( @xmath65 ) in the entire temperature range and the resistance correction follows the expected @xmath64 temperature dependence down to 10mk . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly shows that the electrons of a mesoscopic sample can be cooled to such low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> fitting the temperature dependence of the resistance correction to @xmath66 ( dotted line in figure[r_t ] ) , we determine @xmath67 and compare it to the predicted value @xcite of @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the thermal length and @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a value @xmath71 which is in very good agreement with the theoretical value of @xmath72 .    ) . </S>",
    "<S> the solid green line corresponds to the aak prediction , the black ( a ) , red ( b ) and blue ( c ) solid lines correspond to the nrg calculation assuming @xmath73mk , @xmath74mk , and @xmath75mk , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows typical magneto - resistance curves at different temperatures.,width=264 ]    the phase coherence time is then measured via standard weak localization ( see inset of figure [ nrg_webb ] ) and the phase coherence length is extracted via the hikami - larkin - nagaoka formula@xcite . from the relation @xmath76 </S>",
    "<S> we then calculate the phase coherence time as displayed in figure [ nrg_webb ] . </S>",
    "<S> we fit the experimental data with the aak expression such that an almost perfect agreement is obtained at high temperatures @xmath77 , as shown by the green solid line . </S>",
    "<S> the prefactor we extract from this fit @xmath78 is in very good agreement with the theoretical prediction of @xmath44 . at temperatures below 100mk </S>",
    "<S> our data deviate substantially from the aak prediction . to see whether these deviations can be explained by the presence of a very small amount of magnetic impurities , we simulate the temperature dependence of for the presence of a small amount of magnetic impurities using the nrg calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the black ( a ) , red ( b ) and blue ( c ) solid lines correspond to a simulation assuming @xmath0=40mk , @xmath0=10mk , and @xmath0=5mk , with an impurity concentration of @xmath10=0.008ppm , @xmath10=0.013ppm , and @xmath10=0.015ppm , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear from our simulations that only magnetic impurities with a kondo temperature @xmath7910mk and with a concentration smaller than 0.015ppm describe satisfactorily the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> a possible magnetic impurity with a kondo temperature in this temperature range is mn ( @xmath803mk)@xcite .    for the sake of objectiveness </S>",
    "<S> let us point out , however , the following : assuming magnetic impurities with a kondo temperature below the measuring temperature leads to an almost temperature independent scattering rate for @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> any experimentally observed saturation of can therefore always be assigned to magnetic impurities with an unmeasurably low kondo temperature . </S>",
    "<S> one could also argue , that it is curious that for the case of gold wires , the observed temperature dependence of can only be described satisfactorily by assuming the presence of one specific magnetic impurity with a kondo temperature below the measuring temperature @xmath8210mk , whereas it is known that the dominant magnetic impurity in gold is iron . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume an additional iron concentration ( 0.015ppm ; @xmath0=500mk ) of the same order as for instance mn ( 0.015ppm ; @xmath0=3mk ) , the temperature dependence of does not satisfactorily describe the experimental data as displayed by the dotted black line ( d ) . </S>",
    "<S> a possible explanation of these facts , might be the presence of a distribution of kondo temperatures , which could be significant for very diluted kondo impurities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a distribution of kondo temperatures has already be seen in point contact experiments@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this , however , can only be verified with phase coherent measurements at high magnetic fields@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that our present results do not allow to rule out the predictions of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion we have shown that the nrg calculation of the inelastic scattering rate describe very well the experimentally observed temperature dependence of caused by the presence of magnetic impurities . </S>",
    "<S> below @xmath0 the inverse of the phase coherence time varies basically linearly with temperature over almost one decade in temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 temperature dependence predicted by the fermi liquid theory , on the other hand , can only be reached for temperatures smaller than @xmath83 and remains an experimental challenge . </S>",
    "<S> + note added in proof : an exact calculation of in presence of disorder supports the above findings @xcite . </S>"
