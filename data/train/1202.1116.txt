    "the _ kepler _ satellite was launched in march 2009 with the primary goal to search for transiting exoplanets in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "it delivers single band - pass light curves of micromagnitude precision and has found hundreds of planet candidates @xcite .",
    "the long , uninterrupted , and high - precision time series photometry taken for a huge number of stars has also led to the discovery of many new pulsating stars and is an ideal basis for an in - depth asteroseismic analysis ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for this analysis and the subsequent asteroseismic modelling ,",
    "precise knowledge of the fundamental parameters of the stars is essential .",
    "these parameters can not be determined from the single band - pass photometry delivered by _ kepler _ alone , however .",
    "hence , ground - based spectroscopic follow - up observations have been undertaken to determine the stellar parameters .    in this paper , we are concerned with @xmath1  doradus candidates found from data assembled with the _ kepler _ mission .",
    "such pulsators are named after their prototype , gamma doradus , whose multiperiodic variable nature was first reported by @xcite .",
    "@xcite discovered a multiperiodic photometric variability with an amplitude of about 0.1  mag and periods of 2.275 and 1.277  d in 9  aurigae and reported on similar behaviour in @xmath1  doradus and hd96008 . following these discoveries",
    ", @xcite introduced a new class of variable stars named after the prototype star @xmath1 doradus .",
    "dor  stars are assumed to pulsate in high - order , low - degree non - radial gravity modes driven by the flux blocking mechanism near the base of their convective zones @xcite .",
    "the typical masses of these stars lie in the range of 1.51.8  m@xmath7 @xcite . according to @xcite",
    ", @xmath1  dor - type stars can be characterised as follows : ( 1 ) spectral type a7f5 and luminosity class iv , iv - v , or v , ( 2 ) low - amplitude photometric variations with periods between 0.5 and 3 days as well as spectroscopic variability seen as both line - profile and low - amplitude radial velocity ( rv ) variations .",

    "table  [ table : observations ] represents the journal of observations and gives the kepler input catalog ( kic ) number , an alternative designation , the number of obtained spectra , the visual magnitude , the spectral type as is indicated in the simbad database , and the period of observations in 2010 .",
    "the number of acquired spectra is different for different stars since we aimed to reach a s / n of about 100 for the mean , averaged spectrum of each object .",
    "the data have been reduced using standard eso - midas packages .",
    "the data reduction included bias and stray - light subtraction , cosmic rays filtering , flat fielding by a halogen lamp , wavelength calibration by a thar lamp , and normalisation to the local continuum .",
    "all spectra were additionally corrected in wavelength for individual instrumental shifts by using a large number of telluric o@xmath124 lines .",
    "the cross - correlation technique was used to estimate the rvs from the individual spectra so that the single spectra finally could be shifted and added to build the mean , high s / n ratio averaged spectrum of each star .",
    "the rvs computed at this step have also been used to check for possible variations due to binarity , high - amplitude stellar oscillations and rotational modulation .",
    "the `` classical '' method of spectrum analysis by means of equivalent width measurements and subsequent fitting of the ionization equilibria of different elements requires the star to rotate slowly , so that a sufficient number of clean , un - blended spectral lines can be identified and measured in the stellar spectrum . in the case of rapidly rotating stars , this method fails due to the high percentage of blended lines .",
    "the method of spectrum synthesis , on the other hand , is based on the comparison between observed and theoretical spectra in a certain wavelength range .",
    "its advantage is that the effect of line blending can be taken into account when computing the synthetic spectra and thus no restrictions with respect to the rotational velocity occur .",
    "because of the large number of fast rotators in our sample , we use the second method comparing the observed spectra with a huge number of synthetic spectra computed on a grid in the stellar parameters . against the much faster approach of solving the so - called inverse problem , i.e. to determine the physical parameter values directly from the observations using some non - linear optimization method , the grid search has the advantage that it will always determine the globally best solution if the grid is dense enough .",
    "its principal disadvantage of much longer computing time plays no crucial role in our analysis since the synthetic spectra are calculated using a large library of pre - computed model atmospheres ( table[table : atmospheremodels ] ) and the analysis runs very fast on up to 300 processor cores of a cluster pc .",

    "the errors of measurement ( 1@xmath126 confidence level ) are calculated from the @xmath125 statistics .",
    "a detailed description of the method is given in @xcite ( paper  i ) .",
    "for the calculation of synthetic spectra , we use the lte - based code synthv @xcite which allows the computation of spectra based on individual elemental abundances .",
    "the code uses pre - calculated atmosphere models which have been computed with the most recent , parallelised version of the llmodels program @xcite .",
    "both programs make use of the vald database @xcite for a pre - selection of atomic spectral lines .",
    "the main limitation of the llmodels code is that the models are well suitable for early and intermediate spectral type stars but not for very hot and cool stars where non - lte effects or absorption in molecular bands may become relevant , respectively .",
