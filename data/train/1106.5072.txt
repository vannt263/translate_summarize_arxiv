    "the general theory of relativity is the most satisfactory description of gravitational phenomena .",
    "the theoretical breakthrough came with einstein s geometrical representation of gravity : as different test masses fall in the same way in a gravitational field , gravity must be a property of space and time rather than of the masses themselves .    until now",
    ", almost all successful tests of general relativity ( shapiro time delay @xcite , light deflection by the sun @xcite , perihelion shift of the orbit of mercury @xcite ) have been probing the gravitational field of the sun , without considering its proper rotation .",
    "however , general relativity predicts that the stationary field of a rotating body is different from the static field produced by the same non - rotating mass .",
    "the difference is known as gravito - magnetism and consists of a drag of space - time due to the mass currents .",
    "the rotational frame - dragging effect is also known as the lense - thirring ( lt ) @xcite effect .",
    "a direct experimental evidence of the existence of the gm field has been obtained so far by ciufolini @xcite and by francis everitt and the gp - b group @xcite .",
    "the lense - thirring effect , averaged over several orbits , has been recently verified by analysing the node orbital motion of two laser ranged freely falling satellites ( lageos-1 and lageos-2 ) which orbit the earth . in the measurement presented in ref .",
    "@xcite the two lageos satellites were used to confirm the lt effect with an accuracy of the order of 10% .",
    "however , the launch of a third properly designed satellite lares will give the opportunity to measure the lt effect with an accuracy of the order of 1% ( citare ) .",
    "the possibility to detect lense - thirring with ring lasers has been discussed in the past @xcite .",
    "recently it has been already pointed out that a multi - gyros system is able to test locally the lense - thirring effect @xcite : an array of six , @xmath1 @xmath2 side , square ring - lasers have enough sensitivity for this purpose .",
    "the rings must have different orientation in space . in the present paper",
    "we concentrate the attention on the symmetries of the rings arranged on the faces of a cube or along the edges of an octahedron , extracting the relevant relations important for the diagnostics of the system . at the end",
    "we summarize and sketch the proposed experiment . for completeness we must mention that an experiment of the type we are planning and preparing could also be made in principle using matter waves instead of light .",
    "this possibility has been proved experimentally for various types of particles such as electrons @xcite , neutrons neutrons , cooper pairs @xcite , calcium atoms @xcite , superfluid he3 @xcite and superfluid he4 @xcite .",
    "cold atoms interferometry , in particular , yields very high sensitivity and it is suitable for space experiments because of the apparatus small size .",
    "however , atoms interferometry experiments in space do not provide an independent measurement of the earth angular velocity , are affected by the mass distribution of the earth , and test the average of the relativistic effect rather than the local one .",
    "eventually , the comparison between in - space and on - ground measurements could be very valuable .",
    "gravito - magnetism ( gm ) is a general relativistic phenomenon related to the presence of mass currents in the reference frame of a given observer . in the case of celestial bodies , including the earth , and excluding translational motion with respect to the center of the body , gravito - magnetic effects are due to the absolute rotation of the massive source with respect to distant stars .",
    "when the einstein equations in vacuum are applied to this kind of symmetry and are linearised ( weak field approximation ) gm is accounted for by the analogue of a magnetic field of a rotating spherical charge . in practice at the lowest approximation level , a dipolar gm field",
    "is obtained , with the dimensions of an angular velocity .",
    "its explicit form in a non - rotating reference frame centred on the source ( in our case the earth center ) , is ( see e.g. @xcite )    @xmath4   \\label{gm}\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 is the position of the laboratory with respect to the center of the earth and @xmath6 is the angular momentum of the earth , whose modulus is of course given by the product of the moment of inertia of the planet multiplied by its angular velocity .",
    "the effect produced by a field like ( [ gm ] ) on a massive test body moving with velocity @xmath7 looks like the one produced by a magnetic field on a moving charge : in fact , the geodesic equation in weak field approximation reads = g + v b [ eq : geod1 ] where @xmath8 is the newtonian gravitational field , so that the effect can be described in terms of a gravito - electromagnetic lorentz force , where the newtonian gravitational field plays the role of the gravito - electric field ( ge ) .",
    "furthermore , the rotation of the source of the gravitational field affects a gyroscope orbiting around it , in such a way that it undergoes the so - called lense - thirring precession , or dragging of the inertial frames of which the gyroscope defines an axis@xcite .",
    "this phenomenon shows up also when one considers a freely falling body with local zero angular momentum ( zamo : zero angular momentum observer ) : it will be seen as rotating by a distant observer at rest with the fixed stars @xcite .",
    "gravito - magnetic effects can in principle be measured applying different methodologies .",
    "the one that has most often been considered is focused on the behaviour of a gyroscope , that can be either in free fall ( on board an orbiting satellite ) or attached to the rotating earth .",
    "the axis of the gyroscope is affected in various ways by the presence of a gravitational field . as for gm ,",
    "a little mechanical gyroscope is the analogous of a small dipolar magnet ( a current loop ) , so that it behaves as magnetic dipoles do when immersed in an external magnetic field .",
    "when studying the motion around the earth of a gyroscope whose spin vector is @xmath9 , one is led to the formula @xcite : =  s [ prec ] in appendix [ a1 ] we work out the explicit expression of @xmath10 in general relativity and , more in general , in metric theories of gravity , using the parametrized post - newtonian ( ppn ) formalism@xcite : we show that it is related to the gravito - magnetic components @xmath11 of the metric tensor and its expression is given by ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : omegaprime])-([eq : omegath ] ) ) @xmath12 , so that we can distinguish four contributions , namely the geodetic term @xmath13 , the lense - thirring term @xmath14 , the preferred frame term @xmath15 , the thomas term @xmath16 .",
    "all terms in @xmath10 are called relativistic precessions , but properly speaking only the second is due to the intrinsic gravito - magnetic field of the earth , namely it is @xmath17 , and manifests the lense - thirring drag .",
    "ciufolini @xcite deduced the relativistic precession of the whole orbital momentum of two lageos satellites whose plane of the orbit is dragged along by the rotating earth . again on eq .",
    "( [ prec ] ) was based the gp - b experiment , whose core were four freely falling spherical gyroscopes carried by a satellite in polar orbit around the earth @xcite . while time goes on and the available data grow it is expected that the lense - thirring drag will emerge from the behaviour of the unique ( so far ) double pulsar system @xcite .      a different experimental approach consists in using light as a probe . in this case",
    "the main remark is that the propagation of light in the gravitational field of a rotating body is not symmetric .",
    "the coordinated time duration for a given space trajectory in the same sense as the rotation of the central source is different from the one obtained when moving in the opposite direction .",
    "this asymmetry would for instance be visible in the shapiro time delay of electromagnetic signals passing by the sun ( or jupiter ) on opposite sides of the rotation axis of the star ( or the planet ) @xcite@xcite .",
    "this property of the propagation of light is the one which we wish to exploit in our earth - bound experiment using a set of ring lasers . in a terrestrial laboratory ,",
    "light circulating inside a laser cavity in opposite directions is forced , using mirrors , to move along a closed path in space .",
    "what is closed from the view point of the laboratory is not so for a fixed - stars - bound observer , but the essential is that the two directions are not equivalent and that the two times required for light to come back to the active region are ( slightly ) different . as it happened already in the case of the mechanical gyroscopes , here too the difference in the two times of flight is made up of various contributions depending on the rotation of the axes of the local reference frame with respect to distant stars , on the fact that the local gravitational ( newtonian ) potential is not null , and of course on the gm drag ( which is our main interest ) .",
    "what matters , however , is that the final proper time difference ( a scalar quantity ) is invariant : it does not depend on the choice of the reference frame or of the coordinates .    performing the calculation in linear approximation for an instrument with its normal contained in the local meridian plane ( see the appendix [ a1 ] details ) we find    @xmath18 \\ ,   \\label{eq : totale}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 is the area encircled by the light beams , @xmath20 is the angle between the local radial direction and the normal to the plane of the instrument , measured in the meridian plane , and @xmath21 is the colatitude of the laboratory ; @xmath22 is the rotation rate of the earth as measured in the local reference frame ( which includes the local gravitational time delay ) .",
    "( [ eq : totale ] ) can also be written in terms of the flux of an effective angular velocity @xmath23 through the cross section of the apparatus : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the area enclosed by the beams and oriented according to its normal vector @xmath26 .",
    "in particular , it is @xmath27 , and the term proportional to @xmath28 is the purely kinematic sagnac term , due to the rotation of the earth , while @xmath12 encodes the relativistic effects ( see appendix [ a1 ] )    for a ring laser in an earth - bound laboratory , the geodetic and lense - thirring terms are both of order @xmath29 with respect to the sagnac term , while the thomas term is 3 orders of magnitude smaller . as for the preferred frame term , the best estimates @xcite show that this effect is about 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the geodetic and lense - thirring terms .",
    "consequently , to leading order , the relativistic contribution to the rotation measured by the ring laser turns out to be @xmath30 , which we aimed at measuring in our experiment . in other words ,",
    "the goal of our experiment will be the estimate of @xmath10 ( see fig .",
    "[ figpre ] ) which embodies the gravito - magnetic effects in a terrestrial laboratory .",
    "in particular , the proposed experiment can also provide high precision tests of metric theories of gravity which are described in the framework of ( ppn ) formalism .",
    "in fact , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : omegads10]-[eq : omegalt10 ] ) , we see that , on setting for the rotating earth @xmath31 , we obtain    @xmath32 \\label{eq : omegalt1b } \\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are ppn parameters ( e.g. @xmath35 and @xmath36 in general relativity ) which account for the effect of preferred reference frame and the amount of space curvature produced by a unit rest mass , respectively .    as shown in sect .",
    "[ con ] , from a high precision measurement of the vector @xmath37 in the meridian plane , we should be able to place new constraints on the ppn parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    ", as a function of the colatitude @xmath38 .",
    "the continuous , dashed and dotted lines correspond to @xmath39 projected along the directions : i ) parallel to @xmath40 ( i.e. @xmath41 ) ; ii ) @xmath42 ( local radial or zenithal direction ) ; and iii ) @xmath43 ( local north - south direction ) , respectively . to evaluate the contribution to @xmath44 from @xmath45 ,",
    "we have projected @xmath45 along @xmath40 ( continuous line plus triangles ) and @xmath43 ( dotted lines plus squares ) .",
    "we note that the gravito - electric term has only the @xmath43 component and therefore along the radial direction we have a pure gravito - magnetic term . ]",
    "a ring laser converts time differences into frequency differences . in fact , since the emission is continuous , the right handed beam adjusts itself to give a standing wave whose wavelength is an integer sub - multiple of the space length of the loop @xmath46 : @xmath47 .",
    "the same happens with the left handed beam , but being the total time different , also the wavelength of the corresponding standing wave will be different : @xmath48 .",
    "the two modes of the ring can have different @xmath49 , a situation usually called split mode , but the higher accuracy of the measurement has been obtained so far with the two modes with equal @xmath49 . considering the time of flight difference in terms of the wavelengths of the two standing waves we see that :    @xmath50    the ring laser equation  @xcite relates the frequency splitting @xmath51 of the two optical beams inside the ring interferometer with the experienced rotation rate of its mirrors @xmath52 where @xmath46 is the perimeter and @xmath53 is the laser wavelength .",
    "the response @xmath54 of a ring laser to the rotation rate @xmath55 , in units of rad / sec , is simply a rescaling of the frequency splitting by the scale factor @xmath56 , i.e. @xmath57    the scale factor @xmath58 plays a crucial role in the accuracy of the measurement of @xmath59 and to estimate the relativistic effects the ratio @xmath60 must be known and kept at @xmath61 accuracy level for months .",
    "the requirements to keep the apparatus in the optimal working conditions will be discussed in section [ sec : c ] .",
    "since the effective angular velocity as well as the gravito - magnetic one is of the order of @xmath62 , angles between vectors must be measured at the corresponding accuracy level .",
    "unfortunately , the absolute measurement of @xmath63 in the fixed stars reference system with the accuracy of nano - radians can hardly be achieved .",
    "however , we can relax this requirement by using @xmath64 ring lasers oriented along directions @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) , where not all @xmath65 lie in the same plane .",
    "in fact , @xmath59 can be completely measured by means of its projections on at least 3 independent directions ( e.g.defining a tri - dimensional cartesian system ) and the redundancies of the measurement can be used as a monitor and control of the stability of directions @xmath65 .",
    "we further assume that ring lasers have identical sensitivity and noise parameters . from an experimental point of view",
    "this can be easily satisfied by building the devices with scale factors that differ less than @xmath67 .    in order to simplify the sensitivity calculations of the system one can consider multi - axial configurations endowed with symmetries .",
    "as all the ring laser normals @xmath65 are equivalent in space , symmetric configurations should be more efficient in the rejection of spurious effects and in the control and monitoring of the relative orientation of the ring lasers .",
    "the natural choice is to take advantage of space symmetries of regular polyhedra , setting one ring for each plane parallel to their faces .",
    "if we do not consider the degeneration between opposite faces , we have m=3 in the case of the cube , 4 for tetrahedron and octahedron , 6 for dodecahedron , and 10 for icosahedron .",
    "there is a peculiar geometry with @xmath68 , obtained by arranging the rings along the edges of an octahedron , where the different rings can be nested together , sharing 2 by 2 the same mirrors",
    ". we will refer to it in the following by speaking of `` octahedral configuration '' .",
    "the @xmath68 is the minimum number of rings necessary to reconstruct the rotational vector , but a redundancy is very appropriate to enhance statistic and to have control tests on the geometric accuracy .",
    "+ in general , by simple arguments , one can demonstrate that , for regular polyhedra configuration @xmath69and that @xmath70    as a consequence , one can study linear and quadratic combinations of ring lasers responses @xmath71 which are invariant under permutations of the ring laser labels @xmath72 , i.e. @xmath73 and @xmath74 . for non - symmetric configurations",
    "we can generalize their definition as @xmath75 and @xmath76 , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are suitable constants which depend on @xmath79 .",
    "the interest in such linear or quadratic forms relies on their behaviours in the presence of noise fluctuations or variations of the geometry of the configuration .",
    "they also allow us to carry out analytical estimates of the overall sensitivity of a tri - axial system of ring laser to relativistic effective rotation rates .",
    "the response of each ring laser can be conveniently written as @xmath80where @xmath81 account for systematic errors in the scale factors and orientations in space and @xmath82 represents the additive noise that affects the rotation measurement @xmath83 , that we assume averaged on the observation time @xmath84 .",
    "we assume as well that @xmath82 are gaussian distributed random variables with zero mean and variance @xmath85 .",
    "modulus @xmath86 and direction @xmath87 represent the deviations from regular polygon geometry in the plane and from polyhedra geometry in the space , due to scale factor fluctuations @xmath88 and infinitesimal rotations @xmath89 , respectively . in what follows",
    "the crucial assumption is that systematic errors ( scale factors and relative alignment of @xmath90 ) are negligible with respect to statistical errors , i.e. @xmath91 or equivalently @xmath92 , while the dihedral angles @xmath93 can nearly approximate a regular polyhedron configuration .",
    "redundancy of responses , if @xmath94 rings are involved , can be used to control systematic errors projected along the direction of @xmath95 .",
    "in fact , the rigidity of the configuration imposes some linear kinematic constraints among different estimates of the laboratory rotation .",
    "in general , any linear combination of 3 responses @xmath71 gives an estimate of the local rotation @xmath95 and we can test the consistency among different estimates by means of the ordinary least square fit . a very simple linear constraint can be found for regular polyhedral configurations @xmath96 and we will illustrate its statistical property as an example of the power of the method",
    ".    from the definition of @xmath97 immediately follows that it is gaussian distributed with zero mean and standard deviation @xmath98 . in addition , possible misalignments @xmath99 or scale factor fluctuations @xmath100 are amplified by a factor of @xmath101 in the mean value of @xmath97 @xmath102 without affecting the corresponding variance @xmath103 .",
    "thus @xmath104 can be used as a  null constraint \" which is minimum when the configuration geometry is a regular polyhedron , and so the overall mean error parallel to @xmath95 can be monitored at @xmath105 accuracy level .",
    "an estimate of @xmath106 for symmetric configurations readily follows from eq .",
    "( [ eqquad ] ) @xmath107 its mean value and standard deviation read ( see app .",
    "[ a2 ] ) @xmath108 in addition , one can demonstrate that @xmath109 is non - central @xmath110 distributed with @xmath111 degrees of freedom and non - centrality parameter @xmath106 . in order to estimate the relativistic effective rotation",
    ", we must subtract @xmath112 from the rotation rate estimated in the laboratory . to this end",
    "we calculate the difference @xmath113 that , in the limit of high snr ( @xmath114 ) , tends to be gaussian distributed with mean @xmath115 and standard deviation @xmath116 where we have neglected terms of the order of @xmath117 .",
    "the @xmath118 of the parallel component of relativistic effective rotation is increased by a factor of @xmath119 with respect to the sensitivity of each ring laser .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that we compare scalar quantities ( moduli of rotation vectors ) measured with respect to the local and distant stars reference systems .",
    "its drawback is the very poor sensitivity to the perpendicular component @xmath120 of the relativistic effective rotation .",
    "in fact , @xmath121 @xmath122 , and the ratio between the second term ( which is associated to the perpendicular component as @xmath123 ) and the first term is @xmath124 .",
    "it is worth noticing that statistical fluctuations of @xmath97 ( control of geometry by redundancy ) and @xmath109 ( measure of relativistic effects ) are uncorrelated , and that they tend to be independent in the limit of high snr .      by arranging the response of ring lasers @xmath71 as m - tuples in a @xmath111-dimension vector space @xmath125",
    ", we can easily define projection operators that allows the estimate of local meridian plane @xmath126 and also the direction @xmath127 of @xmath95 in the physical space .",
    "moreover , the norm of projected random vectors are described by remarkably simple statistics . according to the definition of the matrix product we have @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is a @xmath130 matrix whose elements are @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "thus , the random vectors @xmath133 can be projected on the linear subspaces @xmath134 and @xmath135 of dimensions 2 and @xmath136 , which represent respectively a plane in the physical space and its complementary space .",
    "the physical symmetry of the rotating earth imposes that the relativistic effective rotation vectors and @xmath137 lie in the same plane , i.e. the meridian plane , and therefore the knowledge of the orientation of this plane is crucial if we want to measure not only the modulus but the whole vector .",
    "we recall that a plane is defined as the set of the points @xmath138 , where @xmath139 and @xmath140 range over all real numbers , @xmath141 and @xmath127 are given orthogonal unit vectors in the plane .",
    "the parallelism of @xmath142 with the normal to the meridian plane can be tested under the hypothesis that the rotation signal is fully located in the @xmath134 subspace while the @xmath135 subspace contains only noise .",
    "the test can be easily performed over the norms of the two projections @xmath143 and @xmath144 to indicate the l-2 norm in the m - dimensional euclidean response space .",
    "the @xmath145 projection matrices @xmath146 and @xmath147 can be written explicitly as functions of the unit vectors @xmath141 and @xmath127 @xmath148 where @xmath149 is a @xmath150 matrix with columns @xmath141 and @xmath127 , and @xmath151 is the @xmath145 identity matrix . as shown in appendix [ a2 ] , the probability distribution of @xmath152 is non - central @xmath110 with 2 degrees of freedom and non - centrality parameter @xmath153 , while @xmath154 should be @xmath110 distributed with m-2 degrees of freedom .",
    "the best estimate of @xmath155 and @xmath156 is then obtained by @xmath157 where the @xmath158 is taken over the unit sphere .",
    "the direction of the earth rotation axis can be estimated as a particular case of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dodb ] ) .",
    "in fact , the projectors @xmath159 and @xmath160 can be obtained by substituting the matrix @xmath149 for the @xmath161 matrix @xmath162 with columns @xmath127 .",
    "the difference lies in the dimension of the corresponding subspaces , i.e. @xmath163 and @xmath164 have dimension 1 and m-1 respectively .",
    "it is worth noticing that the maximum of eq .",
    "( [ eqsti ] ) can be computed by an analytical formula both for the location of the meridian plane and the direction of the earth rotation axis .",
    "in fact , if we introduce in the local reference frame the ( local ) spherical coordinate ( @xmath54 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 ) ( we use capital letters to avoid confusion with sect .",
    "ii ) and parametrize the unit vectors @xmath141 and @xmath127 with these angles , for instance @xmath167 and @xmath168 , we have that the maximum of @xmath169 and @xmath170 is achieved for @xmath171 where @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 are @xmath145 symmetric matrices which are functions of the @xmath79 alone .    in general , there are no analytical calculations for mean and variance of @xmath176 and one must run monte carlo simulations to get their estimates .",

    "huge amounts of data are recorded in each measurement session , which require physical transport over large distances for the correlation in the analysis centers .",
    "data latency and the fact that there is no continuous measurement coverage are suggesting the investigation of alternative methods for the precise estimation of earth rotation .",
    "furthermore it is desirable to develop an independent measurement technique , in order to identify intra - technique biases if they exist .",
    "ring lasers are possible candidates for such an alternative measurement technique .",
    "they measure the earth rotation locally and within much shorter time intervals .",
    "such gyros are widely used in aircraft navigation and can measure rotations absolute , i.e. independent of an external reference frame . therefore also local contributions to earth rotation are contained in the measurements .",
    "the effects of earth tides , strain , crust deformation , seismic events , polar motion are contained in the ring laser measurements due to their contribution to earth rotation or due to variations in the orientation of the respective ring laser .",
    "however , the demands on such instruments are extremely high and can not be met by existing commercial devices .",
    "they can be summarized as :    * sensitivity to rotation @xmath366 at about 1 hour of integration * sensor stability of 1 part in @xmath203 over several month to years ( chandler wobble ) * resolution in sensor orientation @xmath367 .",
    "this corresponds to polar motion of around @xmath368 at the pole .",
    "this means that a reasonable improvement in sensor sensitivity and stability is still required in order to make ring lasers viable tools to be applied to space geodesy .",
    "the design of the g ring laser is one way of approaching these demands and it not too far away from reaching this goal @xcite .",
    "operating several such ring laser gyroscopes in geophysical independent regions simultaneously offers a unique possibility to distinguish global from local ( monumentation related ) signal contributions through their independent data streams .",
    "the feasibility of the experiment for the measurement of relativistic effective rotation rates appears to rest only on a tri - axial dynamical sensor of local rotation of enough sensitivity . despite the fact that large ring lasers as g are very stable platforms and with the provision of tight feedback systems to stabilize the scale factor ( cold cavity , as well as the active cavity ) , currently ring laser gyroscopes are not able to determine the dc part of the earth rotation rate with a sensitivity compatible with the requirements for detection of the lense - thirring effect .",
    "while the contribution of the varying earth rotation itself presumably can be removed with sufficient accuracy from the c04 series of vlbi measurements , there remains the problem of determining the actual null - shift offsets from the laser functions in the ring laser gyroscope . since the gravito - magnetic effect is small and constant , a good discrimination against laser biases , such as for example ` fresnel",
    "drag ' inside the laser cavity must be achieved",
    ". therefore it will be advantageous to add one or several ring laser cavities in addition to the triad structure for sufficient redundancy .",
    "we also intend to operate at least the g ring laser structure in parallel to the here proposed structure in order to discriminate local perturbation signals from regional and global ones . a second large ring laser located at the cashmere facility in christchurch , new zealand ,",
    "will be used in the data analysis process , provided it can be run with sufficient resolution and stability .",
