    "the rational cherednik algebra @xmath0 is an algebra attached to a complex reflection group @xmath1 and depending on a set of central parameters indexed by the conjugacy classes of reflections in @xmath1 .",
    "the representations of the rational cherednik algebra are closely connected with those of the ( finite ) hecke algebra of @xmath1 , and with the geometry of the quotient singularity @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the reflection representation of @xmath1 .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the groups @xmath4 and use the commutative subalgebra @xmath5 of @xmath0 introduced by dunkl and opdam in @xcite , section 3 , together with the technique of intertwining operators , introduced for the double affine hecke algebras by cherednik ( see , for example , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "our first main result is theorem [ upper triangular ] , where we show that @xmath5 acts in an upper triangular fashion on each standard module @xmath3 with simple spectrum for generic choices of the defining parameters ; the theorem implies the existence of a basis @xmath13 of @xmath3 consisting of functions orthogonal with respect to the contravariant form on @xmath3 .",
    "our second main result is theorem [ submodules theorem ] , in which we describe in a combinatorial way the set of pairs @xmath14 indexing a basis @xmath13 for each submodule of @xmath3 , in those cases for which the orthogonal functions @xmath13 are all well defined .",
    "theorem [ submodules theorem ] may be helpful for understanding two of the outstanding problems in the representation theory of @xmath0 : what are the finite dimensional @xmath0-modules , and ( when combined with the norm formula of theorem [ norm formula ] ) what are the graded composition multiplicities @xmath15 $ ] with respect to the jantzen filtration of @xmath16 ?",
    "one benefit of our approach is that it is elementary , requiring only linear algebra and some well - known combinatorics .",
    "a second benefit is that it provides the most explicit information currently available on the submodule structure of the standard modules ( outside of the case of dihedral groups , worked out in @xcite ) .",
    "the main disadvantage of our approach is that there is no obvious way of generalizing it to the exceptional complex reflection groups ; perhaps this is not surprising , since the groups @xmath10 have the most obvious combinatorial structure of all the complex reflection groups .",
    "a second disadvantage is that one has to work harder to obtain detailed information when the spectrum of @xmath5 is _ not _ simple .",
    "part of the analysis in this more difficult case is carried out for the symmetric group @xmath8 and the polynomial representation @xmath17 of @xmath0 in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we do not attempt to obtain analogous results here , but it should be noted that our theorem [ submodules theorem ] was inspired by a question posed at the end of the paper @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to generalize the results of the papers @xcite and @xcite to arbitrary standard modules @xmath3 .",
    "our paper provides a starting point .",
    "another approach to studying the representations of the rational cherednik algebra is via the corresponding monodromy representations of the finite hecke algebra of @xmath1 ( the `` knizhnik - zamolodchikov functor '' ) .",
    "this is done , for example , in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it has the advantage of applying to all complex reflection groups ( though at present there are only case by case proofs of certain of the necessary theorems for finite hecke algebras of complex reflection groups ) .",
    "it is our feeling that , for the infinite family @xmath10 , the two approachs ( via the kz functor or via diagonalization and intertwining operators ) should be regarded as complementary .",
    "we will now state our results more precisely .",
    "let @xmath18 .",
    "we will assume for the introduction that the reader is familiar with standard young tableaux on @xmath19-partitions of @xmath20 ( see section [ notation ] for our definitions ) .",
    "as a vector space and for any choice of parameters , the algebra @xmath0 is isomorphic to @xmath21 the irreducible @xmath22-modules are indexed by sequences @xmath23 of partitions with @xmath20 total boxes , and if @xmath2 is the irreducible corresponding to @xmath6 then it has a basis @xmath24 indexed by standard tableaux on @xmath6 .",
    "the action of a certain generating set of @xmath4 on this basis can be made quite explicit ( see theorem [ cw modules theorem ] ) .",
    "the standard module corresponding to @xmath6 is then @xmath25 where @xmath26 acts on @xmath2 via @xmath27 for all @xmath28 and @xmath29 . as a vector space @xmath30 and it follows that the elements @xmath31 for @xmath32 and @xmath33 are a basis of @xmath3 , where @xmath34 is the longest element of @xmath35 so that @xmath36 is non - decreasing .",
    "now we can state a simplified version of our first main result .",
    "the more precise statement is theorem [ upper triangular ] .",

    "it is a standard part of the representation theory of @xmath10 that the non - zero eigenspaces of @xmath573 restricted to @xmath583 are pairwise non - isomorphic irreducible @xmath10-modules and that as @xmath6 ranges over a set of representatives for the @xmath584-orbits on @xmath19-partitions of @xmath20 we obtain each irreducible @xmath10-module exactly once .",
    "it follows that the module @xmath575 is a verma module for @xmath554 , and that all the verma modules for @xmath554 arise in this way as summands of verma modules for @xmath0 .",

    "the element @xmath591 maps @xmath575 into @xmath592 and induces a vector space isomorphism of @xmath590 onto @xmath593 ( @xmath252 and @xmath594 should be taken modulo @xmath582 ) ; in particular the graded dimension of @xmath590 is given by @xmath595 .",
