    "due to their strong and persistent surface magnetic fields , active m dwarfs can produce frequent flares , sometimes lasting for many hours and reaching luminosities that approach a significant fraction of the star s bolometric luminosity @xcite . during both solar and stellar flares ,",
    "emission is seen as line and continuum radiation from x - ray to radio wavelengths , with a prominent mode of radiative energy release occurring in the blue and near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) continuum , which is commonly referred to as the white light continuum .",
    "unfortunately , the spectral components which comprise the white light continuum are not well - constrained , and therefore the physics of the underlying flare mechanism that gives rise to such a conspicuous signature remains a mystery .",
    "significant effort has gone into characterizing the white light continuum in stellar flares , beginning with a single component ( hydrogen recombination ) model @xcite . a two - component spectral model consisting of hydrogen recombination and an impulsively heated photosphere",
    "was first proposed by @xcite as a possible explanation of the spread in broadband flare colors .",
    "time - resolved multi - channel photometry @xcite and spectrometry @xcite were obtained longward of 4200@xmath1 for flares on yz cmi and uv ceti ; at peak , these flare spectra were fit with a planck function of @xmath4k , thereby showing evidence of a hot optically thick component present during the impulsive phases of flares .",
    "instrumental effects shortward of the balmer jump ( 3646 ) prevented a precise characterization of the balmer continuum in the data of @xcite .",
    "higher resolution spectra in the blue / nuv were obtained during large flares on ad leo ( 3560- 4440 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and cn leo ( 3050- 3860 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) showing a nearly continuous rise into the nuv with a @xmath5k blackbody ; surprisingly no discontinuity at the balmer jump was seen in either of these events ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the white light continuum has therefore been attributed to a single dominant blackbody component with @xmath6k ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in contrast , flare models predict spectra that are dominated by hydrogen bound - free continua , which provide a poor match to the observations ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter a06 ) .",
    "a multi - component model was reintroduced by @xcite , who used high - cadence @xmath7 photometric observations of the dm3.5e star ev lac to suggest that the white light emission consists primarily of blackbody radiation at flare peak and hydrogen continuum during the flare decay .",
    "however , significant ambiguity results when using broadband photometry to characterize the white light continuum .",
    "a06 showed that a flare model spectrum that included a large balmer jump , when convolved with broadband @xmath8 filters , actually resembles the shape of a @xmath29,000k blackbody . to unambiguously identify the spectral components present during stellar flares , we have therefore begun to compile a large catalog of time - resolved optical / nuv flare spectra on several nearby flare stars . in this letter , we present time - resolved spectra obtained during a large flare on the dm4.5e star yz cmi and use results from the recent radiative hydrodynamic ( rhd ) flare models of a06 to show that both balmer continuum and hot blackbody components are present in the white light continuum emission .",

    "we used the b400@xmath9r300 gratings , providing wavelength coverage from 3350@xmath109260 .",
    "the observations were taken through a 1.5 @xmath11 slit which yielded resolutions of @xmath12 ( at 4000 ) and @xmath13 ( at 6563 ) , determined from the fwhm of the arc lamp lines .",
    "the slit was oriented at the parallactic angle in order to compensate for atmospheric differential refraction ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we observed yz cmi with exposure times of 10s , and with readout the total cadence was @xmath328s . in total , 163 flare spectra were obtained simultaneously in both the blue and red bandpasses .",
    "the data were reduced using standard iraf procedures , wavelength calibrated using henearhg lamp spectra , and flux - calibrated by comparing observations of the spectrophotometric standard star feige 34 to the accepted fluxes of @xcite . to correct for variable grey slit loss ( e.g. , due to guiding errors ) , we also scaled each spectrum during the flare using the @xmath0-band light curve .",

    "this flare was @xmath3100 times more energetic and persisted for more than 10 times as long as the largest @xmath0-band flare event observed on this star during 55 hours of monitoring from the large statistical flare study of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although it is unknown if the power law fit to the flare - frequency distribution of @xcite holds at high flare energies , an extrapolation predicts that flares with @xmath0-band energies @xmath23 ergs occur at a rate of @xmath3once per month .",
    "the spectral data were obtained while the @xmath0-band emission was still elevated 15 - 37 times ( 3 - 4 mag ) over quiescence .",
    "complex morphology is seen in the @xmath0-band light curve during this time period ( see figure [ fig : figs]a ) , allowing us to study the flare continuum variations during several smaller impulsive events .",
    "figure [ fig : figs]b shows a spectrum ( @xmath24min after the flare start ) from 3350@xmath105500@xmath1 near the beginning of our spectroscopic observations during the @xmath0-band decay from a large secondary emission peak . a quiescent spectrum of yz cmi ( see  2.2 )",
    "is also shown in figure [ fig : figs]b and has been subtracted from the flare spectrum to give a `` flare - only '' spectrum .",
    "our spectra have the highest time resolution with high signal to noise in the blue / nuv ( s / n @xmath25 50 at 3600 ) ever obtained during a large stellar flare .",
    "they are also unique in having simultaneous high quality photometric information so that we may relate the spectral evolution to the light curve morphology .    we have for the first time convincingly identified two distinct continuum components that simultaneously contribute to the optical / nuv flux in flare spectra .",
    "the first component dominates the spectrum from 4000 - 4800@xmath1 and exhibits the rising trend of a @xmath210,000k blackbody , which is plotted on the spectrum in figure [ fig : figs]b using a filling factor , x@xmath26 , of 0.22% of the projected stellar disk area .",
    "we follow @xcite to constrain the filling factor of blackbody emission as a function of time using the equation :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the flare flux observed at earth in the continuum windows from 3995 - 4020 , 4140 - 4210 , 4425 - 4450 , and 4600 - 4800 ; @xmath29 , @xmath30@xmath1 pc @xcite and @xmath31k .    from figure",
    "[ fig : figs]b , it is clear that the blackbody fit does not explain all of the continuum emission at wavelengths shorter than @xmath33800 .",
    "starting near h10 ( 3799 ) , there is a rise to h15@xmath9h16 , the last two apparent balmer lines in emission .",
    "blueward of @xmath33700 , the flare spectrum becomes flat into the nuv , and there is excess flux visible above the 10,000k blackbody at these wavelengths .",
    "a06 presented rhd flare simulations for a medium ( f10 ) and a strong ( f11 ) impulsive flux of nonthermal electrons into an m dwarf atmosphere .",
    "the a06 models predict strong balmer continuum radiation with a noticeable balmer jump at 3646 , together with a photosphere that is warmed by @xmath31200k to a temperature of 4600k .",
    "we isolated the balmer continuum component of the a06 f11 model spectrum taken at the last time - step of their simulation ( @xmath32s ) , and fit it to the observed flare spectra .",
    "figure [ fig : figs]c shows the flare spectrum from figure [ fig : figs]b with the 10,000k blackbody component subtracted and the model balmer continuum component scaled to the excess emission in the 3600  @xmath33  region .",
    "the shape of the observed excess emission is well - described by the f11 flare model prediction ( shown in red ) .",
    "although there is no abrupt discontinuity indicative of a balmer jump in our observed spectrum , we posit that blending ( possibly due to stark broadening ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the higher order balmer lines in the 3646  @xmath34 3800  region effectively hides the sharp discontinuity that is seen in the model spectrum .",
    "the filling factor for the f11 model spectrum is calculated by scaling the model flux in the 3600 - 3646  region ( @xmath35 ergs @xmath36 s@xmath19 @xmath19 ) to the flux excess observed at earth after subtracting the 10,000k blackbody .",
    "the contribution function for the balmer continuum in the f11 model shows that the emission arises from a relatively thin layer in the atmosphere ( j. allred , private communication ) ; it is therefore reasonable to approximate changes in the filling factor to changes in the emitting area of the balmer continuum .    in the upper panel of figure [ fig : figs]d ( black points ) ,",
    "we show the ratio of the filling factors for a 10,000k blackbody and the model balmer continuum component .",
    "the error bars are obtained by using 9000 and 11,000k temperatures for the blackbody .",
    "the ratio for the sample spectrum in figure [ fig : figs]b is @xmath37 .",
    "the filling factor ratio indicates that the two emission components exhibit significantly different time evolution , with the blackbody source emitting from a region @xmath33 - 16 times smaller than the source of the balmer continuum .",
    "the inferred area filling factor ( @xmath38 ) of the blackbody component is shown separately ( red points ) and exhibits very similar morphology to the @xmath0-band light curve ( reproduced in the lower panel ) .",
    "although we expect the _ total _ continuum flux to follow the @xmath0-band since we scaled the spectra to achieve absolute flux calibration (  3.2 ) , it is surprising that _ only _ the blackbody component follows the @xmath0 band .",
    "it appears that the deviations from the general flare decay seen in the @xmath0 band primarily arise from the changing area of the blackbody emission region .",
    "when the deviations are strongest near the peaks at @xmath39 min and @xmath40 min , the spectra are increasingly dominated by the blackbody component .",
    "this is consistent with the flare - peak spectra from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite and the photometry of @xcite .",
    "we also note preliminary evidence of an apparent increase in the best - fit blackbody temperature to @xmath41k at the peak near @xmath40 min .",
    "the derived filling factor ratios should be regarded as illustrative since our balmer continuum spectrum from the f11 model of a06 assumes that the nonthermal electron flux is constant at 10@xmath42@xmath1 ergs @xmath36 s@xmath19 . also , we use the model flare spectrum from only one time - step in the rhd simulation .",
    "it is likely that the nonthermal electron flux varied both with time and over the geometry of the flaring region .",
    "any further assessment is beyond the scope of this letter , but we note that the less energetic a06 f10 flare spectrum at @xmath43s gives nearly 10 times larger filling factors for the balmer continuum .",
    "the time - evolution of the balmer continuum closely follows the hydrogen balmer lines .",
    "we show the variation in the balmer continuum ( using the integrated flux in a 30  window centered at 3615 ) compared to the h@xmath44 line flux and the @xmath0 band in the lower panel of figure [ fig : figs]d .",
    "the fluxes are normalized to the last spectral observation we obtained .",
    "the balmer continuum shows a slow decay throughout our observations , as is typical of the balmer line radiation @xcite .",
    "this overall decay is probably extended emission from the previous , much more luminous , impulsive events seen in the @xmath0-band light curve .",
    "the larger variations in the balmer continuum compared to the h@xmath44 emission may be partially due to small errors in isolating the balmer continuum by subtracting the underlying blackbody continuum ( the h@xmath44 flux is well measured as it has a local continuum ) .",
    "as noted above in the filling factor discussion and evident by comparing the upper and lower panels of figure [ fig : figs]d , the balmer line and continuum radiation exhibit quite different time evolution compared to the blackbody emission component .",
    "we propose two possible explanations :    ( a ) : :    the hydrogen - emitting regions exhibit a delayed and more gradual    response to each successive impulsive ( blackbody ) event . in this    scenario ,",
    "the gradual increase in hydrogen balmer emission around    @xmath45 and @xmath46 min are associated with    the impulsive events in blackbody emission ( upper panel ) at    @xmath47 min and @xmath48 min , respectively .",
    "also , balmer emission around @xmath49 min and    @xmath50 min is elevated yet only slowly decreasing , and    could be gradually declining emission from the large    @xmath0-band peaks at @xmath51 min and    @xmath39 min , respectively .",
    "( b ) : :    the time evolution of the blackbody emission and the balmer emission    may be anti - correlated .",
    "if true , this may provide an important    constraint on the origin of the blackbody emission .",
    "the possible    anti - correlation is most apparent during the @xmath0-band rise    starting at @xmath52 min . in @xmath53",
    "min the    balmer continuum decreases by @xmath340% while the    blackbody filling factor almost doubles .",
    "hydrogen continuum dimming is    predicted by flare models @xcite , but only for very short    durations ( 0.1s ) at the onset of a flare .",
    "more detailed models will be required to understand these complex variations , and in particular , the seemingly anti - correlated trends between the blackbody and balmer continuum and lines during the time intervals when the blackbody filling factor is increasing in figure [ fig : figs]d .",
    "we observed a white light megaflare on the dm4.5e star yz cmi in the @xmath0 band and with simultaneous optical / nuv spectroscopy . the @xmath0-band energetics and light curve morphology qualify this flare as an extraordinary and rare event , similar to the @xmath54 erg flare on yz cmi seen by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . following a solar analogy",
    ", we speculate that the flaring region on yz cmi was a complex arcade of sequentially reconnecting magnetic loops . each reconnecting loop accelerated a beam of nonthermal electrons that impacted the lower atmosphere , producing the observed blue / nuv line and continuum emission .",
    "the sum of a large number of individual emitting regions may have enabled this flare to persist for such an unusually long time .    using high time resolution , high signal - to - noise spectra",
    ", we have shown that the blue / nuv flare continuum radiation can be explained as a sum of a @xmath210,000k blackbody component and a balmer continuum component , with only the blackbody emission present from 4000 - 4800 .",
    "the relative filling factors of the two components indicate that the balmer continuum comes from a larger region , plausibly originating from the flaring loops at chromospheric heights , where the balmer lines originate .",
    "this is consistent with the height of the balmer continuum emission derived from solar flare data @xcite , and also with the height of formation predicted by the rhd model of a06 .",
    "we found that the blackbody emission arises from a region @xmath33 - 16 times smaller in area than the balmer continuum emission region .",
    "this blackbody emission may possibly originate in concentrated magnetic footpoint regions in the lower atmosphere , similar to the localized areas that emit in white light during solar flares @xcite , which are often spatially and temporally coincident with impulsive heating by nonthermal electrons inferred from hard x - ray observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in accordance with this scenario , a large complex of photospheric hot spots may have been created during the first impulsive events in the yz cmi @xmath0-band light curve . as the nonthermal electron beams weakened ( in energy and/or in spatial extent ) so did the areal coverage of these hot spots .",
    "this gradual decay extends into the time covered by our spectral observations and is seen in the overall decline of the blackbody areal coverage in the upper panel of figure [ fig : figs]d . during our spectral observations , a few new hot spots may have been created at the footpoints of newly reconnected loops , causing the transient increases seen in the @xmath0-band and in the effective area of the blackbody emitting region .    we see strong evidence through all of our observations for a blackbody continuum emission component with an approximate temperature of @xmath55k .",
    "the persistence of the hot blackbody emission indicates that a continual source of particle acceleration and plasma heating likely still exists during the decay phase of the flare .",
    "yet , the a06 models , which employ a nonthermal electron beam as is seen on the sun , predict the photosphere of an m dwarf to be heated by at most @xmath31200k during a large flare .",
    "the physical mechanism which generates the strong blackbody emission ( presumably from a more strongly heated photosphere ) therefore remains unknown .",
    "the possible anti - correlation between the balmer continuum and blackbody emission components may provide an important clue to the nature of the heating mechanism that is responsible for the blackbody emission .",
