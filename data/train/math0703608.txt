    "in @xcite we showed that the space @xmath6 can be identified with a closed semi - algebraic subset of the character variety @xmath9 .",
    "then we applied the maslov dequantization to this semi - algebraic set ( see also @xcite ) and , using an inverse limit of logarithmic limit sets of this space , we constructed the tropical counterpart of @xmath6 .",

    "the same construction applied to the teichmller space @xmath8 gives back the thurston boundary @xmath12 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give a geometric interpretation of the points of these tropical counterparts .",
    "we are guided by the idea that the points of the tropicalization of a parameter space should be related with the tropical counterparts of the parametrized objects .",
    "every point of @xmath6 corresponds to a conjugacy class of representations of @xmath2 in @xmath3 .",
    "geometrically such a representation corresponds to an action of @xmath2 on a vector space @xmath13 , or , equivalently , on a projective space @xmath14 . in this paper",
    "we introduce the tropical counterparts of these actions , i.e. actions of a group on tropical modules and tropical projective spaces .",
    "this is the notion we propose of tropicalization of a group representation .",
    "there is a naif notion of tropical projective space , the projective quotient of a free module @xmath15 , but these spaces have few invertible projective maps , hence they have few group actions .",
    "we give a more general notion of tropical modules and , correspondingly , of tropical projective spaces .",
    "we show that these objects have an intrinsic metric , the tropical version of the hilbert metric , that is invariant for tropical projective maps , and that the topology induced by this metric is contractible",

    "we extend this to general @xmath0 , and we think that the proper structure to study these objects is the structure of tropical projective spaces . the paper @xcite , developed independently from this work , contains a similar approach to the bruhat - tits buildings .",

    "we compute the length spectra of these actions on @xmath16 , and we show that the length spectrum of an action identifies a boundary point in @xmath10 .",
    "then we use the fact that tropical projective spaces are contractible to show that for every action of the fundamental group of the manifold on a tropical projective space there exists an equivariant map from the universal covering of the manifold to the tropical projective space .",
    "this theorem can hopefully lead to interesting consequences about the interpretation of the boundary points .",
    "for example in the case @xmath5 , where @xmath20 is a real tree , the equivariant map induces a duality between actions of the fundamental group on @xmath20 and measured laminations on the surface ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite )",
    ". it would be very interesting to extend this result to the general case .",
    "for example an action of the fundamental group of the surface on a tropical projective space @xmath16 induces a degenerate metric on the surface , and this metric can be used to associate a length with each curve .",

    "there is a @xmath2-equivariant map @xmath682 an interesting open problem is to understand the dual structure this equivariant map induces on @xmath1 .",
    "the case where @xmath1 is an hyperbolic surface and @xmath683 has been studied by morgan and shalen in @xcite and it is well understood : @xmath20 is a real tree and the equivariant map induces a measured lamination on @xmath1 , that is dual to the action .",
    "this work can possibly lead to the discovery of analogous structures for the general case .",
    "for example an action of @xmath2 on @xmath681 induces a degenerate metric on @xmath1 , and this metric can be used to associate a length with each curve .",
    "anyway it is not clear up to now how to classify these induced structures .",
    "this is closely related to a problem raised by j. roberts ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem 12.19 ) ) : how to extend the theory of measured laminations to higher rank groups , such as , for example , @xmath21 .",
