    "next generation high - energy accelerators like colliders ( large hadron collider ( lhc ) and the international linear collider ) are capable of producing several trillion electron volts ( tev ) energy , but their operation is costly and time - consuming @xcite . plasma based particle acceleration schemes offer a much cheaper alternative .",
    "being an ionized medium , plasmas are an attractive medium for future accelerators because they can support electric field higher than several hundred giga electron volts ( gev ) in a meter which is generally several orders of magnitude stronger than conventional rf accelerators @xcite .",
    "therefore plasma based acceleration scheme is found to be suitable for the acceleration of charged particles to higher energies ; this dramatically reduces the size of the machine and its cost .",
    "plasma acceleration is a technique for accelerating charged particles , using an electric field associated with plasma wave or other high gradient structures ( shock and sheath field ) .",
    "these plasma acceleration structures ( waves ) are generated either using an ultra - short , ultra - intense laser pulse or an ultra - relativistic electron beam propagating through the plasma @xcite .",
    "typically plasma acceleration process is categorized into two types , laser wakefield acceleration ( lwfa ) and plasma wakefield acceleration ( pwfa ) . in lwfa",
    ", plasma electron wave is excited using ultra - short , intense laser pulse that expels plasma electron and excites a wake wave having phase velocity equal to the group velocity of the laser pulse due to its radiation pressure . on the other hand , in pwfa ,",
    "an ultra - relativistic electron beam is used to drive the wake wave instead of a laser pulse .",
    "this externally injected electron beam repels the plasma electron and generates wake wave ( phase velocity is equal to the velocity of the beam ) due to space - charge force @xcite .",
    "hence a late coming beam or charged particle rides on this excited wave and gets accelerated to high energies . the success of lwfa scheme has been confirmed in a number of experiments by accelerating charged particle to gev energies in a meter long plasma @xcite . in 2007 , blumenfeld et .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated the success of pwfa scheme by accelerating electrons from the tail of a driving beam of energy 42 gev to maximum energy of 85 gev at slac ( stanford linear accelerator center ) . in 2014 , litos et al .",
    "@xcite have minimized the energy spread of the beam ( @xmath0 2 percent ) using discrete trailing bunches as a driver in their experiment .    in 1979 ,",
    "tajima and dawson first proposed the basic concepts of plasma acceleration and its possibilities @xcite . in 1984 ,",
    "a group of scientists from ucla ( university of california , los angeles ) designed the first experimental device for wakefield acceleration and produced an accelerating gradient several orders of magnitude higher than conventional rf accelerators @xcite .",
    "plasma wakefield acceleration ( pwfa ) scheme was first proposed by chen , huff and dawson in 1984 as a means of coupling the relativistic electron beam to the plasma electron wave @xcite . as stated above , in pwfa , an ultra - relativistic electron beam propagates through plasma which expels the nearby plasma electrons .",
    "ions do not respond because of their heavy mass and they only provide a neutralizing background .",
    "these repelled plasma electrons are then attracted by the massive ions which are left behind and they overshoot their corresponding initial positions because of their inertia . hence a plasma wave ( wake wave ) is excited just behind the beam that has phase velocity equal to the velocity of the beam @xcite .",
    "the structure of this relativistic electron beam driven wakefield has already been studied extensively in 1-d as a function of beam density ( @xmath1 ) and beam velocity ( @xmath2 ) by several authors @xcite , where the ion motion was completely negelcted because of their high inertia . in 2015 , excluding the effect of ion motion , ratan et al .",
    "@xcite presented a fully generalized analytical treatment for arbitrary beam density and they verified the analytically excited structure by their fluid simulation results .",
    "they also showed that the beam can be considered to be rigid for several plasma periods if the velocity of the beam ( @xmath2 ) is greater than @xmath3 i.e. @xmath4 ; where c is the speed of light and @xmath5 is the lorentz factor associated with beam velocity ( @xmath2 ) . for lower values of @xmath2",
    "the beam was found to be compressed for @xmath6 and splited into different beamlets for @xmath7 ; where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the beam length and plasma wavelength respectively .",
    "recently , in their another report @xcite , it was shown that the excited wake wave gradually modifies with time and finally breaks , exhibiting spikes in density profile , via phase mixing process .",
    "it was found that the excited wake wave is a `` akhiezer - polovin '' ( ap ) mode , excited using the same parameter values of the wake wave .",
    "the underlying mechanism behind the wake- wave breaking was understood in terms of phase - mixing process of ap mode .",
    "they also showed that the numerical wake wave breaking time ( minimum time needed to break the wave ) matches with the analytically estimated values .    in previous studies @xcite ,",
    "the plasma ions were assumed to be immobile due to their heavy mass . in 1998 ,",
    "khachatryan et al .",
    "@xcite reported in the study of strong plasma waves ( i.e. @xmath10 ) that plasma ions ( even heavy ions ) make an essential contribution to the process of charge separation under the influence of such a strong field where maximum relativistic wavelength and amplitude of the wave grow in proportion to @xmath11 . here",
    ", @xmath12 is the lorentz factor associated with the velocity of the electrons . ions also play a crucial role in case of semiconductor plasma where the positively charged particles ( holes ) have a mass similar to or less than that of an electron @xcite .",
    "the study of relativistic plasma waves , including ion motion , is also important for some astrophysical phenomenon . in the polar region of the pulsars , it is considered to be filled with electron - positron plasma and energetic charged particles are being generated from the plasma waves .",
    "as stated above , in pwfa , strong plasma waves are excited in plasma , using the relativistic electron beam .",
    "therefore it is important to incorporate the dynamics of ion for the study replicating the structure of the wakefield in such applications . in this paper , with the help of the fluid simulation , we have studied the structure of the relativistic electron beam driven wakefield where the effect of the ion motion is included . including ion motion , rosenzweig et al.@xcite presented a semi - analytical form of the electron beam driven wakefield and estimated the approximate value of transformer ratio ( for mass ratio @xmath13 ) only for beam density equal to the half of plasma density using multiple - fluid ( ion and electron fluid ) model . for further extension of rosenweig s work @xcite",
    ", we have performed our simulation for arbitrary mass ratio ( @xmath14 ) and beam density ( @xmath1 ) using a rigid beam .",
    "we have used the velocity of the beam larger than @xmath3 throughout our simulation to avoid the deformation in beam density .",
    "it is shown that simulation results match with the semi - analytical results given by rosenzweig et al .",
    "@xcite for different beam density and mass ratio . transformer ratio ( @xmath15 ) which determines the efficiency in the acceleration process is also studied as a function of mass ratio and beam density ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "for @xmath16 , we have observed that it becomes high for higher mass ratio ( e.g. @xmath17 ) compared to corresponding values obtained for lower mass ratio ( e.g. @xmath18 ) , for some specific values of beam density ; where @xmath19 is the background equilibrium plasma density .",
    "we have also shown that the excited wake wave is identical to corresponding khachtryan s mode @xcite , excited using the same parameter values of the wakefield .",
    "we have observed in our simulation that the density of the excited wake wave also gradually modifies and becomes spiky after several plasma periods .",
    "the corresponding electric field profile also turns into sawtooth form which is a clear signature of wave breaking @xcite .",
    "this particular feature observed in the simulation has been found to be absent in the analytical calculations given in ref .",
    "the physical mechanism behind the wave breaking has been understood in terms of phase mixing process of the wake wave .",
    "it is seen here that the numerically obtained wave breaking limit lies much below the analytically estimated value given by @xcite .    in next section ( section -ii )",
    ", we present the basic equations governing the excitation of relativistic electron beam driven wakefield .",
    "we have discussed our numerical techniques for this study in section - iii .",
    "our numerical observations and the detail discussion of the obtained results has been covered in section - iv .",
    "we have summarized our study in section v.",
    "the basic equations governing the excitation of 1-d relativistic electron beam driven wakefield in a cold plasma are the relativistic fluid - maxwell equations .",
    "these equations contain the continuity and momentum equations for electron beam , plasma electrons and plasma ions .",
    "we have used poisson s equation for calculating the electric field in the system .",
    "here we have considered that the electron beam is moving along @xmath20-direction in an infinite , homogeneous plasma channel .",
    "our present study has been focused on exciting a relativistic electron beam driven wakefield only in longitudinal direction ( along beam propagation ) . therefore neglecting the variation of plasma parameters ( density , velocity and electric field for both the electrons and ions ) in the transverse direction ( transverse to the beam propagation ) , the basic normalized governing equations in 1-d are , @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24    @xmath25    @xmath26    @xmath27    where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the @xmath20-components of momentum of plasma electron , plasma ion and beam electron having @xmath20-component of velocity @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath2 respectively . here ,",
    "@xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the relativistic factors associated with plasma electron , plasma ion and beam electron respectively . in above equations",
    ", @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath1 represents the density of plasma electron , plasma ion and electron beam respectively .",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath14 represents the @xmath20-component of the electric field and mass ratio ( ratio of electron to ion mass ) respectively . in the above equations ,",
    "we have used the normalization factors as , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "equations ( [ pl_cont]-[pois ] ) are the main key equations needed to examine the excitation of 1-d electrostatic relativistic electron beam driven wakefield excitation in a cold plasma . in this present paper , we have simulated the above equations in the rigid beam limit ( i.e. @xmath51 ) using fluid simulation technique . in next section",
    ", we have discussed the fluid simulation techniques developed to excite the relativistic electron beam driven wakefield for a rigid beam driver .",
    "in this section , we present numerical techniques used to study the relativistic electron beam driven wakefield excitation in a cold plasma where the dynamics of ion has been included .",
    "we have developed a 1-d fluid code ( lcpfct ) based on flux - corrected transport scheme @xcite to study the space - time evolution of an ultra - relativistic electron beam driven wakefield in a cold plasma .",
    "the basic principle of this scheme is based on the generalization of two - step lax - wendroff method @xcite . in 2015 , ratan et al .",
    "@xcite showed that beam can be considered to be rigid only if @xmath4 . in this limit ,",
    "beam evolution equations ( [ beam_cont ] ) and ( [ beam_mom ] ) can be neglected . in our present simulation , we have also considered @xmath4 in all cases .",
    "therefore , in simulation , we have ignored the evolution equations of beam which is moving along @xmath52 direction with a speed close to the speed of light inside the plasma without any deformation in its shape .",
    "using lcpfct routine , we have solved the equations ( ( [ pl_cont]),([pl_mom ] ) , ( [ ion_cont]),([ion_mom ] ) and ( [ pois ] ) ) with non - periodic boundary conditions along @xmath52 direction . here the driver beam is allowed to propagate from one end of the simulation window to its other end .",
    "it was already shown by ratan et al .",
    "@xcite that the excited wakefield is independent of initialization or initial perturbation in fluid simulation .",
    "therefore we have evolved the simulation without any initial perturbation .",
    "electron beam itself perturbs the system and excites the wake wave .",
    "we have recorded the profile of electron density ( @xmath36 ) and electric field ( @xmath38 ) with time .",
    "here we present the numerically obtained profiles of perturbed electron density ( @xmath53 ) and electric field ( @xmath38 ) profile with time for different beam density and mass ratio . in all our simulations , we have used beam velocity @xmath54 and beam length @xmath55 .",
    "the numerical perturbed density ( @xmath53 ) and electric field ( @xmath38 ) profiles of the excited wake wave are shown in figures ( [ fig1 ] ) and ( [ fig2 ] ) respectively at different times for @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath54 and @xmath58 .",
    "the numerical perturbed density ( @xmath53 ) and electric field ( @xmath38 ) profiles are plotted in figures ( [ fig3 ] ) and ( [ fig4 ] ) respectively at different times for @xmath59 , @xmath57 , @xmath54 and @xmath58 .",
    "we have obtained the corresponding analytical profiles of wakefield excited for the same parameters used in our simulation from the semi - analytical calculation given in ref.@xcite .",
    "we have plotted these analytical profiles in blue lines shown in figures ( [ fig1]-[fig4 ] ) .",
    "it is clear from figures ( [ fig1]-[fig4 ] ) that the numerical profiles match well with the analytical profiles for different beam densities and mass - ratios . in figure ( [ fig5 ] ) ,",
    "we have shown the plot of perturbed electron density profile ( @xmath53 ) obtained for @xmath18 , @xmath59 , @xmath54 and @xmath60 at @xmath61 along with the profile , where the effect of ion motion is completely neglected @xcite . as expected , it is clear from figure ( [ fig5 ] ) that ion motion may be neglected for small values of @xmath14 . in figure ( [ fig6 ] ) ,",
    "we have plotted analytical values of transformer ratio @xmath62 obtained from @xcite along with numerical values as a function of @xmath14 for two different values of @xmath63 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 ; where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the maximum value of accelerating electric field behind the beam and maximum decelerating electric field inside the beam respectively .",
    "we have found that numerically obtained transformer ratio matches well with the analytical values .",
    "we have also plotted the transformer ratio ( @xmath15 ) in figure ( [ fig7 ] ) as a function of beam density ( @xmath66 ) for @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "it is observed that for @xmath17 , @xmath15 oscillates with increasing @xmath67 ; whereas for @xmath18 , @xmath15 initially oscillates with @xmath67 but for @xmath68 for some specific values of @xmath67 ( see fig . [ fig7 ] ) , transformer ratio is higher for @xmath17 as compared to @xmath18 .",
    "the transformer ratio determines the energy gain of the acceleration along the dephasing length .",
    "typically , higher the value of transformer ratio ( @xmath15 ) larger the energy gain in the process of acceleration .",
    "our simulation shows that for an overdensed beam ( @xmath69 ) , the transformer ratio , for some specific values of beam density , is higher for electron - positron plasma as compared to that for a hydrogen plasma .",
    "we have observed in our simulation that the numerical profiles of perturbed electron density ( @xmath53 ) and electric field ( @xmath38 ) match with the analytical results for several plasma periods ( see figures ( [ fig1]-[fig5 ] ) ) .",
    "after several plasma periods , subsequently , they start to deviate .",
    "the amplitude of the electron density gradually increases and shows spiky behavior at later times ( @xmath70 ) shown in figure ( [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "this feature , indicating the density bursts , is known as wave breaking @xcite . to understand the basics of wave breaking process of the wakefield",
    ", we first identify that the wake wave is the corresponding  khachatryan mode \" @xcite .",
    "it is well known that , including the ion dynamics , the solution of 1-d relativistic fluid - maxwell equations ( equations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) and without the beam term in poisson equation ( 7 ) ) in a cold plasma is a  khachatryan mode \" @xcite which is parameterized in terms of @xmath14 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 ; where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the phase velocity and the maximum amplitude of the electric field associated with the wave .",
    "therefore the electron beam driven wakefield ( structure behind the beam ) which is a solution of ( equations ( 1 - 7 ) ) with @xmath73 , is a corresponding khachatryan mode excited using the same values of @xmath14 , @xmath74 and @xmath72 of the wake wave . using the value of @xmath14 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 from the simulation ,",
    "we have plotted the corresponding khachatryan s mode on top of the wake wave excited for @xmath56 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath17 in figure ( [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "it is seen that the structure of the wake wave shows a good match with the corresponding khachatryan mode .",
    "it is already well accepted that the amplitude of a wave sustained in a medium is limited by its wave breaking limit .",
    "if the amplitude of the wave exceeds this limit , it breaks resulting in the destruction of coherent motion . in 1998 , khachatryan et al .",
    "@xcite analytically calculated the wave breaking limit for a relativistically intense plasma wave ( including ion motion ) in terms of the maximum amplitude of electric field as , @xmath75 $ ] ; where @xmath76 , @xmath77 $ ] and @xmath78 . in our simulation , the wake wave ( which is a khachatryan mode ) having phase velocity equal to the velocity of the beam breaks after several plasma periods , exhibiting sharp spikes in density profile . in simulation , at the point of wave breaking , we note the corresponding maximum amplitude of electric field ( @xmath79 ) for different values of @xmath14 , where @xmath59 , @xmath55 and @xmath54 . in figure ( [ fig10 ] ) , we have plotted both numerical and theoretical values of @xmath79 ( khachatryan s wave breaking limit ) as a function of mass ratio ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "it is seen that the wave - breaking limit of numerically excited wake - wave lies much below the analytically estimated limit . here the wake wave breaks much below the analytical wave breaking limit . in other words , the wake wave breaks",
    "before it reaches to its wave breaking amplitude . in our simulation ,",
    "the numerically excited wake wave breaks via the phase mixing process , which arises because of relativistic mass variation effects @xcite . in this process",
    ", the frequency of the oscillation of plasma electrons and ions becomes space dependent .",
    "hence , after a certain time , the nearby particle crosses each other and the wave finally breaks .",
    "therefore the wake wave breaks due to phase mixing process before it reaches to its wave breaking limit ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "khachatryan et al .",
    "@xcite calculated the wave breaking limit without considering the contribution of phase mixing process in their theory .",
    "we have studied relativistic electron beam driven wakefield in a cold plasma using fluid simulation techniques where the effect of ion motion is included .",
    "it is shown that simulation results match with the analytical results for different beam density and mass ratio . at later times",
    ", the numerical result gradually deviates from the analytical result and finally breaks via phase mixing process .",
    "we have shown that the excited wake wave is alike to the corresponding khachatryan s wave @xcite .",
    "we have numerically obtained the wave breaking limit which is found to be much below the analytically estimated values by khachatryan et al . @xcite .",
    "the underlying reason for this is understood in terms of phase mixing process which arises here because of relativistic mass variation effects .",
