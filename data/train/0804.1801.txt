    "if these conditions are not fulfilled , the uniform current flow becomes unstable , and non - uniform self - organized structures ( e.g. , filaments and overheated domains with higher or lower electric fields ) arise in the sample .",

    "with further increasing the current @xmath10 , the driving force acting on a single vortex , @xmath13 , overcomes the pinning force , and a significant fraction of the vortices start to move .",

    "note that the phases iii and iv have an analogy with the ndr behavior of electron motion in _ semiconductors _ with the increase of the voltage .",
    "namely , increasing the applied force on the moving particles produces a lower velocity in them . at high current densities ,",
    "the driving force completely overcomes the pinning force ( phase v ) and the curve @xmath14 tends to a linear one .    the results obtained in refs .   and prove that the _ vi_-curves of superconductors with a square paps have a part with ndr of the s - type , since the electric field in the sample is related to the average vortex velocity by the well - known relation @xmath15 .",

    "we consider a sample with a square array of @xmath9 pinning sites interacting with @xmath8 vortices related to the magnetic field by @xmath22 .",

    "the characteristic spatial period of the arising current filament structure is of the order of @xmath194 in a very unstable state , @xmath195 , the filament width is small , @xmath196 .",
    "the characteristic instability build - up time becomes @xmath197 .",
    "thus , a sample with an s - type ndr in _",
    "vi_-curve divides itself into small filaments with different current densities ( in different dynamic flux flow phases iii and iv ) if the resistance and inductance of the external circuit are restricted by inequalities @xmath198    the obtained results are valid if @xmath199 according to eq .",
    "( [ crit ] ) , the left hand side of the last inequality should be higher than unity , while the right hand side is much smaller than 1 for the parameter range studied in the previous sections if the sample half - width @xmath200  mm .",
    "note , however , that taking into account the magnetic field dependence of the _ vi_-curve gives rise to some increase in its stability .",
    "in the stationary inhomogeneous state that arises after the development of the filamentary instability , the electric field should be uniform over the sample . the part , @xmath201 , of the filament with the higher current @xmath107 and the part , @xmath202 , with the lower current @xmath106 ( see fig .",
    "2b ) are defined by an evident condition @xmath203 , that is , @xmath204 for the case shown in fig .",

    ", sufficiently high disorder destroys the ndr of s - type in the _ vi_-curve , but the ndr of n - type can still exist in this case due to sample heating .",
    "such an unstable regime has been thoroughly studied for superconductors  @xcite , and we do not discuss it here .    a richer dynamics can be observed if the _ vi_-curve has ndr parts of _ both _ n- and s - types , figs .",
    "2b and 3 . in this case the filaments with higher",
    "current density @xmath107 are unstable if the system is far from the voltage - biased regime  @xcite . the instability of the filament with n - type _",
    "vi_-curve should switch the filaments into state d ( fig .",
    "2b ) with high resistivity or to the formation of the domain structure with higher , d , and lower , e , resistivity  @xcite .",
    "however , any possible decay of the unstable state c gives rise to a non - uniform electric field distribution in the sample and , as a result , to non - zero @xmath206 .",
    "thus , the state that appears after the instability develops is not stationary but rather a dynamic one .",
    "to clarify the situation , we consider two possible _",
    "vi_-curves shown in fig .  7 ( one red and another , labelled by  2  , with a green branch ) and",
    "assume that the total current value in the circuit is fixed , @xmath207 .",
    "in a more general case , after the decay of the unstable state c , the filaments with higher current density will be overheated and transit to the higher resistive state d. in this state d the flux lines move fast , which , along with the temperature increase due to the thermal conductivity , gives rise to the acceleration of the flux flow in the lower - current filaments . as a result , the high - resistivity overheated state moves from point d to a lower electric field range , while the low - resistivity state ( point b ) moves to a higher electric field range ( point a ) .",
    "if we assume that the system has a _",
    "vi_-curve of the type 2 ( green ( dark grey ) dashed curve in fig .  7 ) , then the high - current filaments in d move to the state a@xmath208 with current density @xmath147 and a higher electric field than in the initial state a. the filaments in point b move to point a and jump to point a@xmath208 . as a result ,",
    "a new stable uniform state with @xmath209 appears .",
    "however , if the _ vi_-curve has the form shown by the red curve 1 , the stable stationary point with the current density @xmath147 does not exist .",
    "in this case , the high electric field state moves from point d to the marginal stability point f and then falls down to a lower branch of the _ vi_-curve curve ( point f@xmath208 ) . in this state",
    "f@xmath208 the electric field is lower than in the state b with lower current . as result ,",
    "the state moves from f to f@xmath208 and then to point a , which is the only uniform state corresponding to the fixed current value @xmath147 .",
    "however , this state is unstable , and the cycle @xmath210 is repeated ( branch 1 in red in fig .",
    "another branch ( branch 2 with the green segment ) of this cycle involves the stable filament state b and is as follows : @xmath211 such a dynamic state has a non - stationary pattern of resistive domains coexisting and intertwinned with current filaments .",
    "the specific form of these patterns , and their dynamics can be very complex , and requires investigations beyond the scope of this study .",
    "the influence of temperature on the dynamic phases and current - voltage characteristic of superconductors with periodic pinning array was investigated here .",
    "it is demonstrated that this effect can change the _",
    "vi_-curve drastically . for a range of values of the pinning array parameters and",
    "heat transfer characteristics it is possible to obtain the _",
    "vi_-curves with a negative differential resistivity of ( i ) either n- or s - type , ( ii ) _ vi_-curves with _ both _ types of ndr , or _ vi_-curves _ without any _ ndr parts . the uniform flux flow is unstable if the _ vi_-curve has a part with ndr .",
    "the formation of resistive domain structures and/or propagating the resistive state through the sample is a characteristic of _ vi_-curves of n - type , while a filamentary instability with sample regions ( filaments ) having different current densities is a characteristic of _ vi_-curves with ndr of s - type .",
    "much more complex regimes can be expected in the case of _ vi_-curves with ndr parts of both types . in this case",
    "the possibility of arising dynamical non - uniform regimes is argued .",
