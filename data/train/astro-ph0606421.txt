    "the whipple group ( hall et al .",

    "@xmath1-ray emission from lsi + 61@xmath2 303 has been interpreted in terms of the inverse compton ( ic ) scattering model in which stellar radiation is scattered by electrons accelerated on the shock wave either created in collisions of the stellar and pulsar winds ( e.g. maraschi & treves 1981 ) , or by electrons accelerated in the jet and scattering of synchrotron and stellar radiation ( e.g. bosch - ramon & paredes  2004 ) .",

    "can be naturally explained provided that the production region of @xmath1-rays lays inside the binary system , i.e. not far away from the massive star .",
    "then , the optical depths for accelerated electrons ( and produced @xmath1-rays ) are large enough for developing the ic @xmath0 pair cascade in the radiation field of the massive star ( dubus 2006 , bednarek  2006 ( b06 ) ) . for the geometry of the considered binary system ,",
    "the radiation field is strongly anisotropic if considered with respect to the injection place of the electrons .",
    "such general type of anisotropic ic @xmath0 pair cascades in the radiation of the massive stars have been considered in the past by bednarek  ( 1997 , 2000 ) and sierpowska & bednarek  ( 2005 ) , and recently applied to the binary systems ls 5039 and lsi + 61@xmath2 303 by bednarek  ( b06 ) .",

    ", we considered @xmath1-ray production in the cascade model assuming that electrons are injected isotropically at some distance from the massive star .",
    "based on those calculations , we were able to predict at which orbital phases the largest fluxes of tev @xmath1-rays should be expected .",
    "in fact , these predictions have been successfully tested by the magic observations ( albert et al .",
    "2006 ) . in this paper , based on the anisotropic cascade calculations ( b06 ) ,",
    "we discuss a more specific model for the @xmath1-ray production in lsi + 61@xmath2 303 . here",
    "we assume that electrons are accelerated on shocks waves propagating along the jet launched from the vicinity of the compact object .",
    "they are injected along the jet with specific injection efficiency which does not depend on the phase of the binary system .",
    "we do not consider the effects of possible changes of the acceleration efficiency related to , e.g. variations in the accretion rate onto the compact object and neglect the possible radiation from the equatorial disk around the massive be star in respect to its emission from the surface . in the present code",
    "we include the synchrotron losses of electrons in the jet which were not considered in previous work ( b06 ) .",
    "in the simple model considered in this paper it is assumed that electrons are accelerated continuously along the jet propagating from the compact object perpendicularly to the plane of the binary system . we can apply a simple scaling of the magnetic field along the jet assuming its conical structure with the fixed opening angle @xmath21 , @xmath22 where @xmath21 is assumed of the order of @xmath23 rad , the scaling factor @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the distance along the jet from its base .",

    "the acceleration rate of electrons ( with the lorentz factors @xmath1 ) in the jet can be parametrised by , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the energy of accelerated electrons , @xmath29 is the acceleration efficiency , @xmath30 is their larmor radius , @xmath31 is the magnetic field at the acceleration site ( in gauss ) , @xmath32 is the electron charge , and @xmath33 is the velocity of light . the basic role in the above formula is played by the acceleration efficiency of particles @xmath29 .",
    "the theory of shock acceleration process estimates the value of @xmath29 as @xmath34 , i.e. @xmath35 for @xmath36 ( malkov & drury  2001 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the presence of relativistic leptons with energies @xmath37 ev inside the crab nebula suggests that @xmath29 should be not very far from unity for relativistic winds .",
    "therefore , we consider values of @xmath29 in the range @xmath38 .    during the acceleration process , electrons lose energy mainly by the synchrotron and the inverse compton ( ic ) processes .",
    "we are interested in the situations in which electrons can be accelerated to tev energies .",
    "this is not easy to obtain relatively close to the base of the jet where the magnetic field is large and the synchrotron losses very strong .",
    "therefore , in the case of the ic process we consider distances from the accretion disk for which the energy losses on the massive star radiation dominate and the ic losses on the disk radiation and the synchrotron photons can be neglected .",
    "let us estimate the maximum energies of electrons in such shock acceleration process allowed by the energy losses .",
    "the energy loss rate by the synchrotron process is given by , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the energy density of the magnetic field , @xmath1 is the lorentz factor of electrons , and @xmath41 is the thomson cross section .",
    "electrons lose energy on the ic process in the thomson ( t ) regime , if their lorentz factors are , @xmath42 ( where @xmath43 k is the surface temperature of the massive star which determines the black body spectrum , and @xmath44 is the boltzman constant ) , and in the klein - nishina ( kn ) regime , for the lorentz factors @xmath45 . the energy loss rate in the thomson regime",

    "[ eq2 ] and  [ eq3 ] gives the maximum allowed lorentz factors of electrons due to the synchrotron energy losses , @xmath51 the maximum energies allowed by ic process in the thomson regime are ( from eq .  [ eq2 ] and  [ eq4 ] ) , @xmath52 and in the kn regime are ( from eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] and  [ eq5 ] ) , @xmath53 note that the limit given by eq .",
    "[ eq7 ] is only valid provided that @xmath54 , i.e when the parameters of the jet and the massive star fulfil the following condition , @xmath55 ( from eq .",

    "the limit given by eq .",
    "[ eq8 ] has to be taken .",
    "7.7truecm    the maximum lorentz factors , to which electrons can be accelerated at a specific part of the jet , are determined by the acceleration efficiency and the energy losses through synchrotron and ic processes .",
    "these energy loss processes depend on the conditions in the jet ( magnetic field strength , acceleration efficiency ) , on the parameters of the massive star ( its radius , surface temperature ) , and on the distance of the acceleration region from the massive star . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we plot the maximum lorentz factors of electrons as a function of the distance from the base of the jet ( given by either eq .",
    "[ eq6 ] , or eq .  [ eq7 ] , or eq .  [ eq8 ] ) , for selected values of the acceleration efficiency , @xmath29 , and the ratio , @xmath56 , at the periastron and the apastron passages of the compact object on its orbit around the massive star .",
    "it is clear that the maximum energies of accelerated electrons depend not only on the distance from the base of the jet but also on the phase of the binary system .",
    "they increase with the distance from the base of the jet as @xmath57 , when the acceleration process is saturated by synchrotron energy losses ( see also bosch - ramon et al .",
    "however , at the regions of the jet where the magnetic field is relatively weak ( farther from the base of the jet but still close to the massive star ) , the acceleration process is saturated by ic energy losses .",
    "then , the maximum lorentz factors of electrons are significantly lower ( note the broad parabolic dips in fig .",
    "1 , especially evident during the periastron passage of the compact object ) .    in order to achieve the maximum lorentz factors , obtained from the above formulae",
    ", the acceleration process has to occur locally in the jet , i.e. the advection time scale of relativistic electrons moving with the jet plasma has to be longer than the acceleration time to the maximum energies determined by energy losses .",
    "the advection ( escape ) time scale of electrons can be estimated by , @xmath58 where the velocity of the jet @xmath59 is in units of the velocity of the light , and the distance along the jet @xmath25 is in units of the stellar radius @xmath7 .",
    "the advection time scale introduces the upper limit on the lorentz factor of the electrons under the condition of their local acceleration , @xmath60 for the distances from the base of the jet down to @xmath61 , and acceleration efficiencies in the range @xmath62 , the acceleration of electrons occurs locally since @xmath63 is larger than the maximum lorentz factors given by eqs .  [ eq6 ] ,  [ eq7 ] ,  [ eq8 ] ( shown in figs .  [ fig1 ] ) . regarding particle cooling ,",
    "it is dominated by radiative processes for the relevant electron energies , providing the particle local cooling , i.e. close to the acceleration place .",
    "7.truecm    by comparing the rate of energy losses of electrons in the synchrotron process and the ic process in the thomson regime ( eqs .  [ eq3 ] and  [ eq4 ] )",
    ", we find out that at distances from the base of the jet lower than @xmath64 , the synchrotron energy losses dominate over the ic energy losses .",
    "therefore , essential contribution to the ic spectra comes only from the part of the jet above @xmath65 since @xmath66 is typically lower for the range of considered parameters . the part of the jet above @xmath67 is considered since losses prevent particles from reaching tev energies for @xmath68 .",
    "we fix this lower bound on @xmath69 ( for arguments see e.g. b06 ) . from another site ,",
    "the upper bound on this region , @xmath70 , is introduced by the condition of advection timescales being shorter than radiation timescales .",
    "based on eq .",
    "[ eq10a ] , in all numerical calculations we fix the upper bound of the jet on @xmath71 .",
    "note moreover , that electrons might be injected by the acceleration mechanism only at specific range of distances from the base of the jet .",
    "however this possibility can not be reasonably specified at the present state of knowledge .    for the acceleration model defined above",
    ", we consider two scenarios for the injection rate of relativistic electrons into the jet .",
    "the spectrum of injected electrons is assumed to be of the power law type described by the single spectral index independent on the distance from the base of the jet @xmath25 .",
    "the injection rate ( number of particles at specific distance @xmath25 ) is assumed to be    1 .",
    "constant along the jet from its base at @xmath67 , 2 .",
    "drops along the jet as @xmath72 .",
    "we have shown above that the cooling time scale of electrons which are able to produce @xmath1-ray photons with energies above 1 gev is shorter than the advection time scale of electrons in the jet ( see eq .  ( 13 ) and the text below ) .",
    "since this cooling time scale of electrons is also much shorter than the characteristic time scale of the considered picture ( determined by the part of the orbital period of the binary system ) , we can assume that all the energy transfered to electrons from the acceleration mechanism at specific time is radiated almost during the same time .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath1-rays can be calculated correctly by complete cooling of the injected electron spectrum .",
    "the model with continuous injection rate of electrons produce very flat @xmath1-ray spectra , inconsistent with the upper limits of the whipple telescope for lsi + 61@xmath2 303 ( hall et al .",
    "2003 , fegan  2005 ) ) .",
    "therefore , we show only the results of calculations for the second injection model of electrons into the jet .",
    "since the optical depths for very high energy @xmath1-rays in the radiation field of the massive star in lsi + 61@xmath2 303 are large , the @xmath1-ray spectra , emerging from the binary system toward the observer , are formed in the ic @xmath0 pair cascades occurring in the anisotropic radiation of the massive stars .",
    "we make use of the monte carlo cascade code described in detail in previous works ( bednarek  2000 , b06 ) .",
    "however the code has been modified in order to include the effects connected with the synchrotron cooling of electrons injected into the magnetic field of the jet .",
    "therefore , in this work we are also able to show the simultaneous synchrotron photon spectra produced by electrons accelerated in the jet . when calculating the @xmath1-ray spectra escaping from the binary system we neglect the effects of doppler boosting due to relativistic motion of the jets since for the parameters typical for lsi + 61@xmath2 30 ( jet speed , @xmath73 and observation angles @xmath6 and @xmath5 ) the doppler factors are rather small , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "these relativistic effects change slightly the angular and energy distribution of electrons in the jet ( as observed from the compact object and the observer rest frame ) and so they are neglected in the present calculations .",
    "note moreover that the possible doppler boosting concerns only the primary ( first generation ) @xmath1-rays produced by electrons in the jet but not to the secondary cascade @xmath1-rays .",
    "the distance of the compact object from the massive star in the binary system lsi + 61@xmath2 303 changes in the range from @xmath76 ( periastron ) up to @xmath77 ( apastron ) . for the periastron passage",
    "the optical depths for @xmath1-rays injected at most of the hemisphere ( on the @xmath0 pair production process in @xmath78 ) are larger than unity ( see e.g. calculations in dubus 2006 , b06 ) . at the apastron passage the optical depths for the @xmath1-rays are larger than unity in some range of angles around the massive star ( see . e.g. bednarek b06 ) .",
    "note that isotropic electrons in the jet produce @xmath1-rays preferencially in directions where they find the largest optical depth .",
    "therefore , the absorption of @xmath1-rays and the interaction of secondary @xmath0 pairs have to be taken into account when calculating the @xmath1-ray spectra produced by electrons in the radiation field of the massive star both at the periastron and the apastron passages .",
    "we have performed monte carlo calculations of the @xmath1-ray spectra escaping from the binary system at arbitrary directions , applying the above mentioned models for the acceleration of primary electrons in the jet , i.e. the injection of electrons along the jet with efficiency dropping from the base of the jet according to @xmath72 . the ic @xmath0 cascade model described in a more detail in bednarek  ( b06 ) has been applied . in this model",
    "we assume that secondary cascade leptons are isotropized by the random component of the magnetic field in the wind of the massive star .",
    "some motivation for that to possibly occur is discussed in bednarek  ( 1997 , sect . 2 of that paper ) .",
    "in this cascade process we consider only ic scattering of the radiation coming from the massive star neglecting the possible contribution from the soft photon field produced in the accretion disk . to allow a simple analysis ,",
    "it is assumed that electrons are accelerated with the power law spectrum and differential spectral index equal to @xmath79 .",
    "the injection of relativistic electrons in the jet as a function of the distance from its base has been also made in other papers concerning microquasars ( e.g. bosch - ramon et al .",
    "the cut - off in the electron s spectrum depends on the location of the acceleration place in the jet and on the phase of the compact object .",
    "it is determined by the synchrotron , or ic energy losses in the jet and by the acceleration efficiency ( defined by the parameter @xmath29 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath56 and @xmath29 are selected in order to allow acceleration of electrons up to tev energies ( see fig .  1 ) . since",
    "two jets are expected from a single compact object , we consider the production of @xmath1-rays in the jet which propagate above the plain of the binary system ( i.e. the _ jet _ directed towards the observer ) and in the jet propagating below the plane of the binary system ( i.e. the _ counter - jet _ ) .",
    "we note that @xmath1-rays produced in the counter - jet may have problems with passing through the matter and radiation of the accretion disk around the compact object .",
    "the transfer of @xmath1-rays through the region of the disk radiation depends on many unknown accretion disk parameters ( see e.g. bednarek  1993 ) and the column density of matter through the accretion disk in ls i 61@xmath2 + 303 is unknown . due to these uncertainties ,",
    "we show separately @xmath1-ray spectra from the jet ( the case when the counter - jet @xmath1-rays are absorbed ) and from the jet + counter - jet ( the counter - jet @xmath1-rays are not influenced by the accretion disk ) .    in order to obtain the first generation of @xmath1-ray spectra from the injected electron spectrum",
    "we cool injected electrons up to energies below 3 gev applying numerical methods .",
    "such approach guaranttee that all the energy of electrons is transfered to radiation provided that the observation time is much longer than the cooling time of electrons below 3 gev . due to this complete cooling of electrons in the jet , the power in electrons accelerated above 3 gev has be approximately equal to the power in the observed @xmath1-ray spectrum above 1 gev .",
    "the results of the calculations of the @xmath1-ray spectra from the cascade developed by these first generation of @xmath1-rays produced in the jet are shown in fig .  2 for the case of an observer located at inclination angles of @xmath6 and @xmath5 , and the compact object at the periastron ( upper figures ) and the apastron passages ( bottom ) ( spectrum of electrons normalised to 1 mev and the injection rate to one electron between @xmath67 and @xmath70 ) .",
    "the @xmath1-ray spectra , produced by electrons injected in the jet at the periastron passage , steepen significantly at energies above a few tens of gev due to the efficient cascading .",
    "this cascading effects are smaller when the compact object is close to the apastron .",
    "the spectra have similar fluxes in the gev energy range but differ significantly in the tev energy range for different parameters @xmath29 and @xmath56 .",
    "spectra produced at the periastron have lower fluxes at tev energies due to the absorption of @xmath1-rays .",
    "the contribution of the counter - jet to the total spectrum is important only at gev energies at the periastron by increasing the flux calculated from the @xmath80 by a factor of @xmath43 - 4 .",
    "in order to be consistent with the observational constraints given by the @xmath1-ray flux observed from the egret source 2eg j0241 + 6119 ( kniffen et al .  1997 ) , and recently measured spectrum at tev energies ( albert et al .",
    "2006 ) , in our modelling a steeper spectrum for electrons injected into the jet has to be applied ( photon differential spectral index equal to @xmath81 ) .",
    "we calculate the @xmath1-ray spectra escaping towards the observer for different phases of the compact object in order to find out exactly at which phases the highest fluxes of gev and tev emission should be expected . in fig .",
    "3 the upper panel , the results of cascade calculations ( for @xmath82 and @xmath83 and the inclination angle @xmath5 ) are compared with the multi - wavelength spectrum of lsi + 61@xmath2 303 .",
    "the ic spectra are shown only above 1 gev due to the technical problems with the calculation of the cascade @xmath1-rays spectra at lower energies ( restrictions on computing time ) .",
    "in fact , the spectra should extend also through the mev energy range ( observed by the comptel detector ) and break at lower energies ( in the region of hard x - rays ) due to the inefficient cooling of electrons in the jet ( as discussed in sect .  2 ) .",
    "the @xmath1-rays in the gev - tev energy range are produced in the ic process and the lower energy photons ( from x - rays up to the soft @xmath1-rays ) result from the synchrotron emission of electrons accelerated in the jet .",
    "we show the spectra at the peak of the tev @xmath1-ray emission occurring at phase @xmath40.5 ( dashed curves ) and at the periastron passage ( dotted curves ) at which the lowest tev fluxes are predicted , after normalisation to the average gev flux of the egret source 2eg j0241 + 6119 reported in the direction of lsi + 61@xmath2 303 .",
    "note that predicted gev flux could vary by only @xmath84 .",
    "so such normalization does not have very strong consequences when estimating the phase dependent tev @xmath1-ray fluxes .",
    "the @xmath1-ray spectrum at tev energies is consistent with the observations by the magic telescope at energies above @xmath4200 gev ( the power law spectrum with the differential spectral index @xmath85 up to a few tev , albert et al .",
    "the magic telescope was not able to detect this source at the low emission state ( phases close to the periastron ) . according to our calculations this low state",
    "should be characterised by a flatter spectrum and the flux on a level of @xmath45 lower than at phase @xmath40.5 .",
    "note moreover , that the level of synchrotron emission produced at phase 0.5 is similar to the rosat x - ray observations reported by goldoni & mereghetti  ( 1995 ) but stronger than the flux reported from direction of lsi + 61@xmath2 303 by the osse detector ( grove et al .",
    "1995 ) .    in fig .",
    "3 the middle panel , we show the expected @xmath1-ray light curves from lsi + 61@xmath2 303 in the gev ( 1 - 10 gev ) and the tev energies ( @xmath3 gev ) .",
    "clear anti - correlation is predicted between the fluxes in these two energy ranges .",
    "this is due to the importance of the cascading processes inside the binary system .",
    "the lowest tev fluxes are expected at the periastron passage of the compact object and the highest fluxes should be observed after the periastron ( with the peak at phase @xmath86 ) .",
    "this specific phase distribution is due to the absorption effects of the tev @xmath1-rays ( cascading effects ) and the location of the observer at the azimuthal angle @xmath87 after the periastron .",
    "note that the observer located at the inclination angle @xmath6 should observe a high level of tev emission in broader range of phases ( half width between @xmath88 up to @xmath89 ) , than for the inclination of @xmath6 ( between @xmath88 up to @xmath90 ) .",
    "this feature might serve as a diagnostic of the inclination angle of the binary system .",
    "the gev flux reaches a peak at phases @xmath40.15 , when the compact object is behind the massive star for the observer located at larger inclination to the plane of the binary system ( i.e. at @xmath5 ) . for this location ,",
    "the cascade , developing towards the observer , meets the largest optical depths which results in the production of large fluxes of the gev @xmath1-rays .",
    "the gev flux could vary by @xmath450@xmath91 with the phase of the binary system .",
    "interestingly , close to these phase ( @xmath40.2 ) there should also be observed a small local peak in the tev @xmath1-ray light curve .",
    "this peak is produced by electrons accelerated at larger distances from the base of the jet at which the escape conditions of @xmath1-rays to the observer are more favorable .",
    "then , tev @xmath1-rays are directed at relatively small angles respect to the massive star photons which enhances the efficiency of @xmath1-ray production .    in fig .",
    "3 the bottom panel , we also show the @xmath1-ray spectra for a few selected phases of the compact object and both inclination angles @xmath92 and @xmath5 .",
    "it is clear that the gev fluxes and spectra do not vary strongly but the tev fluxes and spectra ( @xmath3 gev ) change significantly with the phase of the compact object .",
    "our calculations indicate that the tev spectrum at the periastron should be a factor of @xmath45 lower than at the phase @xmath40.5",
    ". moreover , the tev spectrum at the periastron should be steeper below @xmath4200 - 300 gev and significantly flatter above this energy respect to the tev spectrum expected at the phase @xmath40.5 .",
    "the massive binary systems provide unique conditions for investigating of the basic problem of astrophysics , i.e. the acceleration process of particles , due to the presence of a well - defined target ( the radiation field of the massive star ) .",
    "however in order to derive useful constraints the details of the sometimes complicated radiation processes by accelerated particles ( e.g. cascades in the anisotropic radiation of the massive star ) have to be considered .",
    "calculations of the type described in this paper predict observational features of the @xmath1-ray emission ( in the gev to tev energy range ) which , if observed , strongly indicate on a very efficient acceleration of electrons already close to the base of the microquasar jets and allows to constrain the efficiency of this acceleration process .",
    "in fact , the @xmath1-ray emission from the microquasar type massive binary ls 5039 has been already observed in the tev energies ( aharonian et al .",
    "2005 ) and in the gev energies ( paredes et al .",
    "2000 ) , and from lsi + 61@xmath2 303 is observed in the tev energies ( albert et al .",
    "2006 ) and in the gev energies ( kniffen et al .",
    "our cascade ic @xmath0 pair model predicts the @xmath1-ray light curve in the gev energy range from lsi + 61@xmath2 303 ( fig .",
    "3 ) which shows maximum close to the periastron as suggested by massi  ( 2004 ) .",
    "in contrast , the tev @xmath1-ray light curve peaks at the phase @xmath86 showing clear anti - correlation with the gev emission ( see also earlier calculations of the propagation of @xmath1-rays inside lsi + 61@xmath2 303 by bednarek  ( b06 ) ) .",
    "this cascade model also predicts the flattening of the @xmath1-ray emission above a few hundred gev and lower @xmath1-ray flux at phases close to the periastron .",
    "4.5truecm    the @xmath1-ray spectra shown in figs .",
    "2 and 3 are calculated only from the part of the jet extending below @xmath93 ( in order to fulfil the condition of local , efficient cooling of electrons ) and above @xmath94 .",
    "note , however , that the considered region of the jet is broad enough as to provide the dominant contribution to the escaping @xmath1-rays ( see also bosch - ramon et al .",
    "the region below @xmath94 might contribute only to the gev part of the spectrum .",
    "moreover , the ic model in which electrons in the inner part of the jet scatter soft radiation coming from the accretion disk should predict different @xmath1-ray light curves .",
    "for example , in our model the @xmath1-ray flux depends on the relative orientation of the jet , massive star and the observer predicting the peak of tev emission at phase @xmath40.5 .",
    "these features can be tested by the future gev and tev @xmath1-ray observations . as we mentioned in sect .  1 , the ic model in which collimated electrons scatter",
    "stellar radiation has been already considered in a few papers , e.g. recently by bosch - ramon et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , dermer & bttcher  ( 2006 ) .",
    "these previous works do not take into account the ic @xmath0 pair cascade effects which , as we have show above , can play an important role . in order to quantify this effect we compare in fig .",
    "4 the @xmath1-ray spectra produced by electrons in the jet directly toward the observer and the @xmath1-ray spectra which are formed in the cascade process for the apastron passage where differences between these two spectra are expected to be the smallest .",
    "although the @xmath1-ray spectra above a few hundred gev are almost this same , they differ significantly at lower energies . therefore , the broad band shape of the @xmath1-ray spectra are clearly different .",
    "note that similar effects are expected for the inclination angle @xmath95 since differences between the spectra at the apastron passage for these two inclination angles are small ( see the light curves for these two inclination angles in fig .  3 for the phase of @xmath96 ) .",
    "the cascade process considered in this paper significantly re - distribute the energy in the @xmath1-ray spectrum toward the observer , influencing e.g. the normalization of the spectrum at lower energies . in the works mentioned above the contribution of @xmath1-ray emission from electrons scattering of the disk radiation in the jets of microquasars have also been included .",
    "it was shown that this contribution can not dominate over the @xmath1-rays produced by scattering the stellar radiation .",
    "on the other hand , electrons accelerated in the jet above @xmath93 might contribute to the highest energy part of the @xmath1-ray spectrum and to the low energies ( x - rays ) as a result of synchrotron process and synchrotron self - compton mechanism since synchrotron energy losses of electrons might dominate far away from the massive star ( e.g. atoyan & aharonian  1999 ) .",
    "however , significant variability of the tev flux with timescales similar to the period of the binary system has been recently detected by the magic telescope ( albert et al .",
    "so then , the contribution to the observed @xmath1-ray spectrum from the outer parts of the jet should be rather minor in case particle injection were constant along the orbit .",
    "the problem of the phase dependent accretion onto the compact object has not been considered in the present work ( for possible indications how it can occur see e.g. bosch - ramon et al .",
    "2006 , christiansen et al .  2006 ) .",
    "we concentrated only on the radiation processes occurring during uniform injection of energy along the jet ( independent on the phase ) .",
    "the electrons cooled up to a few gev in the inner jet are advected to the outer parts of the jet .",
    "they can be responsible for the lower energy emission observed from some microquasars .",
    "based on the considered here cascade model , we estimate that a significant fraction of the particle energy ( @xmath97 ) survives the @xmath98 region to allow the formation of radio jets , but it s treatment is out of the scope of the paper .",
    "i would like to thank dr g. romero for useful comments and reading the manuscript and the anonymous referee for many valuable comments and corrections .",
