    "the first principle theory for quarks and gluons is quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , whose goal is to explain all the phenomena relating to the strong interaction .",
    "however , it is known to be difficult since usual perturbative technologies in the quantum theory calculations hardly works for low energy physics in which nonperturbative effect dominates the system then complicates the analyses .",
    "one of characteristic features is non - trivial gluon and chiral condensates in the nonperturbatively correlated system due to the strong interaction .",
    "it is challenging to derive the condensates relying on the perturbative quantum field analyses , then one usually has to use some effective models of qcd for the sake of describing the low energy physics , such as properties of hadrons .    there has been a lot of investigations on low energy phenomena based on various effective theories treating the gluon and chiral condensates .",
    "the instanton includes the gluon condensate though the solution to the classical field equation  @xcite , and various applications have been done  @xcite .",
    "qcd sum rule is formulated by the expansion of the correlation functions in the vacuum condensates  @xcite , which is as well widely used for many applications  @xcite .",
    "the schwinger - dyson equations ( sde ) are the equations for the exact correlation functions of fields  @xcite , and there has been devoted to a lot of analyses  @xcite . the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite is constructed using the analogy with the bcs theory for superconductivity  @xcite ; the model studies the hadron properties based on the back ground chiral condensate  @xcite .",
    "an extension of the njl model has been made in  @xcite where the polyakov - loop contribution is incorporated into the chiral dynamics , and extensive analyses on both the chiral and gluon loop condensates have been performed in the polyakov loop njl ( pnjl ) model  @xcite .",
    "thus the issues on the gluon and chiral condensates are essential in the study of hadron physics , there we believe these two condensates are intimately related to each other .    in this paper , we construct the effective model based on qcd by postulating that gluons form the condensation whose momenta have the sharp peak at the qcd scale  @xcite .",
    "the speculation is inspired by the experiments of the momentum in the bose einstein condensate ( bec ) state where the clear peak in the momentum distribution is actually observed .",
    "we then consider the analogy between the bec state and the gluon condensed state as done in a chiral effective model motivated from the bcs analogy . to be more concrete",
    ", we are going to formulate the gap equation for the gluon condensate from the qcd under the above mentioned assumption with gluon condensate .",
    "it may be important to remark that the solution of the gap equation for the gluon condensate at high temperature behaves badly , since many bosons can unlimitedly occupy the same point due to the statistical property of bosonic fields to cause the catastrophic situation in the gap equation .",
    "therefore the special attention should be paid when one treats the solution at high temperature near the phase transition .",
    "however , although the high temperature results do not behave nicely , meaning that the plots deviate from the expected ones from the bec experimental data , we find that the tendency of the gluon condensate shows physically reliable feature as will be presented later .",
    "we then proceed the analyses based on the gluon condensate by using the gap equation with simple form . here",

    "we construct the effective model for the gluon and chiral condensates starting from qcd with the assumed gluon condensate in this paper .",
    "it is found that one can consider the gap equation of the gluon condensate through evaluating the effective potential .",
    "the solution shows desired behavior to some extent for low temperature region , while the transition near the critical temperature is more drastic compare to the experimental observation of the bec state .",
    "this apparent discrepancy comes from the crucial distribution change at high temperature in the bose - einstein statistics for bosons which affects badly to the system of the gap equation .",
    "therefore , we believe that the further considerations on the treatment of the gap equation for the gluon condensate , especially at high temperature near the transition temperature , should be given so that the model leads the better description on the phenomena of the phase transition .    through the investigation of the coupled model , we studied how the gluon condensate affects to the chiral sector , particularly on the thermodynamic quantities and the critical phenomena .",
    "we find that the gluon condensate lowers the transition temperature , and suppress the quark excitations , i.e. , the pressure , number density and susceptibility .",
    "moreover , the gluon condensate effect reduces the critical temperature at high quark density . here",
    ", it should be very important to note that the transition temperature and the location of the critical point are highly depends on the chosen regularization produce and parameters as already searched in a lot of preceding works ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore it is necessary to carefully see the parameter dependence on the phase transition , which may be the future direction on this model analyses . on the other hand , the tendency that the gluon condensate suppresses the quark excitations for low temperature may be the universal feature of this kind of model with gluon condensate since the suppression is also seen in the pnjl model studies  @xcite .",
    "we think that the current model is still at the primitive level , since our purpose of the paper is to construct the model incorporating the gluon condensate based on qcd , then study the model behavior using the simplest form as the first step analysis .",
    "the crucial point of our simple model is the choice of the effective four coupling , eq .",
    "( [ eq : replace_co ] ) , in which we set the coupling to be proportional to the gluon condensate . the numerical results shown in this paper",
    "are mainly come from the choice of the coupling .",
    "it may be needed to consider the form of the coupling as the function of the gluon condensate , e.g. , @xmath128 , for the sake of constructing more realistic model .",
    "one more important point in our treatment is that we do not study the effect from the gluon chemical potential @xmath129 . in the real situation of the phase transition ,",
    "the gluon chemical potential and quark chemical potential relate each other , then they should be treated simultaneously",
    ". this may also be future direction on this kind of approaches in considering the gluon and quark condensates .",
    "the above mentioned future generalizations may be required and important .",
    "we believe that , since the current model may have the possibility of connecting effective models and the first principle theory of qcd , the further investigations based on this analysis are interesting .    the author thanks to t. inagaki and d. kimura for discussions .",

    "the finite temperature extension of the one - loop contribution in the effective potential can be performed as follows .",
    "in the imaginary - time formalism , we discretize the @xmath130-integral , @xmath131 then we need to take the summation @xmath132,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath133 and @xmath134 for bosons and @xmath135 for fermions .",

    "( [ eq : g_pot_t ] ) and ( [ eq : q_pot_t ] ) .",
    "we see that the gluon condensate becomes negative if we apply the three- or four - momentum cutoff method , which lead the negative effective mass square .",
    "this also happens in the scalar @xmath144 theory , and we are going to discuss the issue of the sign using the @xmath144 theory for simplicity .",
    "let s consider the following lagrangian , @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the scalar field and @xmath147 is the four - point coupling .",
    "this gives the effective potential , @xmath148,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath149 , then the gap equation ( @xmath150 ) leads @xmath151 it is noted that @xmath152 becomes negative if one introduces the four - momentum cutoff scale @xmath153 as , @xmath154\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which leads the negative mass square for @xmath155 . to remedy the situation , we usually perform the renormalization through choosing a specific prescription , e.g. , by using the @xmath156 scheme we have @xmath157,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the renormalization scale @xmath158 .",
    "note that for @xmath159 , @xmath160 becomes positive , then we can avoid the unwanted negative mass square .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we can have the positive @xmath161 as well for the gluon condensate at @xmath110 if we apply the renormalization prescription .",
    "however , the system behaves badly at finite temperature when one considers the above mentioned renormalization .",
    "here it is useful to employ the dimensional regularization , because it gives nice description both at zero and finite temperature contributions simultaneously thanks to applied analytic continuation .",
    "therefore , for the sake of treating all the contributions under consistent way in our effective model analyses , we employ the dimensional regularization procedure for the gluon condensate .",
    "on the other hand , we have for the fermion field , @xmath162 with @xmath163 .",
    "therefore one needs negative @xmath164 in order to get the positive effective mass , and the three- or four - momentum cutoff way nicely works .",
    "this difference on the sign comes from the fact that fermion is a grassmann number , which gives the negative sign in front of the third line of the effective potential , eq .",
    "( [ eq : pot_c ] ) .",
    "in the current model study , we employ the two types of regularization schemes so as to obtain the positive mass sign for @xmath26 and @xmath165 .    for the gluon integration ,",
    "as mentioned above , we apply the dimensional regularization which is defined by @xmath166 where @xmath64 represents the spacetime dimensions , and the mass scale parameter @xmath65 is introduced to obtain correct mass dimensions for the integral .    the three - momentum cutoff scheme , @xmath167 is the most frequently used method for the quark sector .",
    "we introduce the cutoff scale in the loop integral for zero temperature contribution , which gives the close curve to the bcs theory prediction as seen in fig .",
