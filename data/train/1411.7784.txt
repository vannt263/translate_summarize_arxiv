    "pb collisions for @xmath11 5 gev/@xmath7 with respect to cross sections measured in pp collisions , scaled by the nuclear overlap function . this feature can be attributed to the interaction of heavy quarks with the quark - gluon plasma formed in such collisions . the analysis of angular correlations between d mesons and unidentified charged particles in pb ",
    "pb collisions can provide further insight into this topic , allowing us to address medium - induced modifications of charm fragmentation and hadronization and the dependence of the energy loss on the path length the parton travels through the medium .",
    "such a study is of great importance also in pp and p  pb collisions . in pp collisions it allows us to characterize charm - quark jets and study their properties , providing at the same time a reference for the measurements in p  pb and pb  pb collisions . in p ",
    "pb collisions it enables the study of cold nuclear matter effects and the search , in the heavy - flavour sector , for long - range ridge - like structures ( `` double ridge '' ) in near and away - side regions , already observed in hadron - hadron correlations  @xcite .",
    "the analysis was carried out for d@xmath0 , d@xmath1 and d@xmath2 mesons on minimum bias samples of @xmath12 pp collisions at @xmath13 tev and @xmath14 p  pb collisions at @xmath15 tev , for different ranges of the d - meson @xmath9 and different thresholds on the charged particle @xmath9 .",
    "d - meson candidates ( _ trigger _ particles ) were reconstructed from their hadronic decay channels ( d@xmath16 k@xmath17 , d@xmath18 k@xmath19 and d@xmath20 d@xmath21 k@xmath19 ) and selected exploiting their displaced decay vertex topology , pid ( particle identification ) and reconstruction quality cuts on the daughter tracks .",
    "the values of @xmath22 are in the range 0.25 to 2 ( up to 5.6 for the d@xmath2 ) , depending on the d - meson @xmath9 .",
    "the selected d - meson candidates in the signal region ( @xmath23 from the centre of the signal peak in the invariant mass distribution ) were then correlated with charged particles ( _ associated tracks _ ) within @xmath8 and satisfying a selection on their reconstruction quality .",
    "the difference in pseudorapidity @xmath24 and azimuthal angle @xmath25 between the d - meson candidate and the charged - particle track was evaluated .",
    "the contribution of background candidates was subtracted using the correlation distribution from the candidates in the sidebands of the invariant mass distribution ( the regions 4@xmath108@xmath26 away from the signal peak ) , normalized by the ratio of background candidates in signal and sideband regions .",
    "several corrections were applied to the correlation distributions to account for : ( i ) _ associated track reconstruction efficiency _ : each d  hadron pair was weighted by the inverse of the track reconstruction efficiency of the associated track , evaluated from simulations ; ( ii ) _ d - meson selection efficiency _ :",
    "each correlation entry was weighted by the inverse of the d - meson reconstruction and selection efficiency , computed from simulations ; ( iii ) _ limited detector acceptance and detector spatial inhomogeneities _ :",
    "a correction factor was obtained exploiting the event mixing technique , i.e.  correlating d - meson candidates from one event with tracks from other events with similar multiplicity and position of the primary vertex in the beam direction ; ( iv ) _ beauty feed - down _ : mc simulations based on pythia were exploited to evaluate a template distribution of angular correlations between d mesons from b - meson decays and charged particles ; this distribution was scaled to match the the proper ratio of feed - down to prompt d mesons , calculated as described in  @xcite , and subtracted from the inclusive d ",
    "hadron correlation distribution obtained from data ; ( v ) _ secondary track contamination _ , i.e.  tracks from strange - hadron decays or produced in interactions of particles with the detector material . from a mc study ,",
    "no visible angular dependence was found for this contamination .",
    "a global scale factor , corresponding to the fraction of primary particles in the sample of associated tracks , was thus applied to the correlation distributions .",
    "due to the limited statistics available , the fully corrected 2d correlations were projected onto the @xmath25 axis , producing azimuthal correlation distributions , which were normalized to the number of trigger d mesons . a weighted average of the results for the three meson species , consistent among themselves within the uncertainties ,",
    "was then performed . a fit function , composed of a constant term plus two gaussian functions with a periodicity condition ,",
    "was applied to the azimuthal correlation distributions .",
    "the two gaussian functions , centered at @xmath27 and @xmath28 , model the near and away - side peaks in the correlation distribution . physical observables ( near - side yield , near - side peak width , height of the baseline of the distribution , defined as the average height of the points in the transverse region , far from the peaks ) were extracted and compared between the two collision systems and with predictions from monte carlo simulations .",
    "finally , a careful evaluation of all the sources of systematic uncertainties was performed .",
    "the left panel of fig .  [ fig : risdata ] shows a comparison of d  hadron correlations in pp and p  pb collisions , after the subtraction of the baseline , for @xmath29 gev/@xmath7 and associated tracks with @xmath30 gev/@xmath7 . in both systems ,",
    "the near and away - side peaks are clearly visible , despite the statistical fluctuations , and the correlation pattern is similar for pp and p  pb collisions . in the right panel of fig .  [",

    "the near - side associated yields obtained from pp and p  pb correlation distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nsy ] as a function of the d - meson @xmath9 for associated tracks with @xmath32 gev/@xmath7 ( left ) and @xmath33 gev/@xmath7 ( right ) .",
    "the pp and p  pb yields are compatible within the total uncertainties . given the size of the current uncertainties , no firm conclusions on possible modifications of d  hadron correlations due to cold nuclear matter effects can be drawn .",

    "hadron correlation measurement is not feasible on the currently available sample of pb  pb collisions , with the current performance of the alice detectors .",
    "the very low d - meson signal / background ratio and the large number of tracks from the underlying event , not correlated with d mesons , induce substantial statistical fluctuations in the @xmath25 distributions when the background is subtracted .",
    "this washes out any correlation structure possibly present .    after the alice upgrade ( expected for 2018 - 2019 )",
    "@xcite , though , a dramatic improvement of tracking and vertexing performance is expected , which will lead to an increase of the @xmath22 ratio by a factor up to 10 for the d - meson reconstruction .",
    "combined with the increase of a factor @xmath34100 in the alice readout rate for minimum - bias pb  pb collisions , this will enable the study of d  hadron correlations also in this system .",
    "a simulation of the analysis performance on central ( 0 - 10% ) pb  pb collisions was carried out using a template of correlation distributions from pythia . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbpbupg ] , the results of this study indicate a very low statistical uncertainty on the evaluation of the near - side yield , below 1% for @xmath35 gev/@xmath7 and about 10% for @xmath36 gev/@xmath7 , for an integrated luminosity of @xmath37 nb@xmath38 . a substantial reduction of the uncertainties is expected also for pp and p  pb collision systems . after the alice upgrade ,",
    "thus , it should be possible to compare the results in the three collision systems and to quantify the effects of the charm quark energy loss in a qgp medium .",
    "estimates for the statistical uncertainty on the near - side yield from the analysis of the expected pb ",

    "alice measurements of d  hadron angular correlations in pp and p  pb collisions are compatible , within uncertainties , in terms of the correlation shapes and the near - side associated yields .",
    "consequently , no evident influence of cold nuclear matter on the charm fragmentation and hadronization can be claimed .",
    "the correlation distributions are well described by the outcome of pythia simulations as well . while the analysis can not be currently performed in pb ",
    "pb collisions , it will become feasible also in this collision system after the alice upgrade ( 2018 - 2019 ) , when the tracking and vertexing performance of the experiment will be largely enhanced .",
