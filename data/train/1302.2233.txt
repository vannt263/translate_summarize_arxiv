    "the axial charge @xmath0 of the nucleon is a fundamental measure of nucleon structure .",
    "while @xmath0 has been known accurately for many years from neutron @xmath9 decays , a calculation of @xmath0 from first principles still presents a significant challenge .",
    "present lattice calculations  @xcite , except perhaps  @xcite , underestimate the experimental value by a large amount .",
    "the resolution of this problem is of great importance to any further calculation of hadron structure .",
    "lattice calculations of @xmath0 are in many ways connected to calculations of the pion decay constant @xmath1 .",
    "both quantities involve the axial vector current , which is not conserved and thus needs to be renormalized .",
    "though it is standard practice nowadays to compute the renormalization constant nonperturbatively ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) , some scope of uncertainty remains  @xcite .",
    "another common feature is that @xmath0 and @xmath1 seem to be affected by large finite size corrections , in particular at small pion masses , which to leading order cheft and chpt  @xcite appear to be the same in both cases .",
    "this led us to suggest to determine @xmath0 from the ratio @xmath3 .",
    "preliminary results  @xcite were encouraging , and we present here the final analysis of this investigation .",
    "the calculations are done with two flavors of nonperturbatively @xmath10 improved wilson fermions and wilson plaquette action  @xcite , including simulations at virtually physical pion mass and on a variety of lattice volumes .",
    "this allows for a separate extrapolation of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 to the infinite volume and the physical point .",
    ".parameters of our lattice data sets , together with the pion mass , the bare axial charge and the pion decay constant .",
    "also listed are the chirally extrapolated values of @xmath11 . in this work",
    "we use @xmath12 to convert lattice numbers to physical units . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     let us now turn to the axial charge and the pion decay constant . in fig .",

    "the fits involve one free parameter each , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , only .",
    "the leading order expressions are able to describe the data at @xmath16 , @xmath17 on all three volumes , which include data with @xmath18 as well as @xmath19 .",
    "this gives us confidence that the fits provide a reasonable infinite volume extrapolation at the lighter mass point as well , where we do not have access to data with larger @xmath20 .",
    "is not the ultimate benchmark , contrary to common belief . with decreasing pion mass the corrections turn into a @xmath21 behavior .",
    "see also  @xcite . ]",
    "all fits gave @xmath22 .",
    "to obtain continuum numbers , we need to renormalize the axial vector current .",
    "the latter reads @xmath23 the coefficient @xmath24 is required to maintain @xmath10 improvement for nonvanishing quark masses @xmath25 as well . the renormalization constant @xmath26 has been computed nonperturbatively in  @xcite , employing the rome - southampton method  @xcite , with the result     +   +   +    @xmath27    the coefficient @xmath24 is only known perturbatively  @xcite , @xmath28    in table  [ tab2 ] we give @xmath29 in the infinite volume . for pion masses",
    "@xmath30 we demand that we have at least two lattice volumes to ensure a controlled extrapolation . for this reason we excluded the point at @xmath31 , @xmath32 from the analysis .",
    "our results for @xmath29 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . since after finite volume corrections the lightest pion mass is @xmath33 , no extrapolation is required . at the lightest pion mass we find @xmath34 in good agreement with the previous determination and the experimental value .",
    "it turns out that @xmath29 hovers around @xmath35 for @xmath36 , a feature it shares with most other lattice calculations  @xcite . only within the last @xmath37 from the physical point",

    "a novel feature of our calculations is that we have data at virtually physical pion mass and for a variety of lattice volumes and spacings at our disposal .",
    "while our simulations at different lattice spacings indicate that our results are free from discretization effects , simulations on different lattice volumes indicate the presence of large finite size effects .",
    "two approaches have been pursued .",
    "the main result of this paper is a determination of @xmath29 from the ratio @xmath3 , which is free of finite size effects and renormalization errors .",
    "we found that this ratio has a smooth behavior as a function of quark mass , and can be essentially described by a polynomial in @xmath59 , leading to @xmath4 at the physical point , using @xmath5  @xcite to set the scale , in excellent agreement with experiment .",
    "we attempted a direct calculation of @xmath29 and @xmath49 , taking account of finite size corrections and renormalization . to our knowledge , this is the first time finite size corrections have been applied to @xmath0 at physical pion masses .",
    "both approaches give consistent results , suggesting that finite size corrections to both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are well described by cheft and chpt .",
    "let us first consider @xmath0 . utilizing the ( nonrelativistic ) small scale expansion ( sse ) of the cheft , including pion , nucleon ( n ) and @xmath60 degrees of freedom , we obtain to @xmath61  @xcite @xmath62 with @xmath63 \\\\            & + \\frac{25 c_a^2 g_1}{81\\pi^2 g_a f_0 ^ 2 } \\int_0^\\infty dy\\,y\\ , \\sum_{\\substack{{\\boldsymbol{n}}\\\\|{\\boldsymbol{n}}|\\neq 0 } } \\left[k_0(\\lambda(y )    |{\\boldsymbol{n}}|)-\\frac{\\lambda(y)|{\\boldsymbol{n}}|}{3 } k_1(\\lambda(y ) |{\\boldsymbol{n}}|)\\right ] \\\\",

    "let us consider the @xmath77 lattice at @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "this lattice has the lowest pion mass and is especially important for our final conclusions .",
    "taking @xmath80 from  @xcite and @xmath81 from @xmath82 , we find @xmath83 for the total contribution , but only @xmath84 for @xmath75 .",

    "the nlo correction to the pion mass reads  @xcite @xmath90 at smaller values of @xmath20 , @xmath91 , this expression alone can not describe the observed finite size effects  @xcite .",
    "that is not surprising , since in a finite spatial box chiral symmetry does not break down spontaneously .",
    "this is because giving the system enough time it will rotate through all vacua .",
    "this results in a mass gap at vanishing quark masses  , @xmath92 with @xmath93\\ , ,   \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 are the intrinsic scale parameters of the low - energy constants @xmath95  @xcite , with @xmath96 being the physical pion mass . in  @xcite",
    "we found that the pion mass extrapolates indeed to a finite value in the chiral limit , in good agreement with the expected result ( [ mres ] ) .",
    "this also has an effect on @xmath97 in the region of small , but nonvanishing , quark masses  @xcite .",
