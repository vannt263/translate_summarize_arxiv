    "the cp violating qcd @xmath0 angle is the most mysterious of the fundamental parameters of the standard model @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 is highly constrained by measurements of the neutron electric dipole moment ( nedm ) : @xmath1 .",
    "( we work in a basis where @xmath2 , so that @xmath0 is directly related to cp violation and the nedm . )",
    "theorists have long sought a mechanism to explain why @xmath0 is so close to zero .    in this paper",
    "we exhibit a model in which new physics , at possibly very high energy scales , renders @xmath0 an unobservable parameter .",
    "the main idea is quite simple .",
    "we introduce a massless fermionic field @xmath3 which carries both ordinary color and also transforms under another gauge group @xmath4 .",
    "the anomaly associated with the axial transformation of @xmath3 receives a contribution from gluons , so that phase rotations of @xmath3 are equivalent to shifts of the @xmath0 angle . because @xmath3 is massless",
    ", there is a symmetry associated with these phase rotations , allowing us to eliminate @xmath0 entirely .",
    "the @xmath4 interactions are necessary to bind @xmath3 particles into heavy bound states .",
    "these are not observed in low - energy physics , as there is a mass gap which grows with @xmath5 , the strong coupling scale of the @xmath4 interaction .",
    "a novel aspect of our model is that ordinary qcd is embedded in a left - right symmetric group @xmath6 , where here 3 is not due to the number of light quark flavors , but rather the number of colors in qcd .",
    "this structure requires a non - standard higgs sector to generate quark masses as well as another fermion @xmath7 which is a color singlet and charged only under the new @xmath4 group .",
    "there are other viable solutions to the strong cp problem such as axion models , left - right symmetric models and the ones in which cp is broken spontaneously @xcite . in axion models",
    "@xcite , additional particles ( usually heavy scalars and colored fermions ) are added to realize an anomalous peccei - quinn symmetry .",
    "the observed value of @xmath0 qcd is then determined dynamically by the location of the minimum of the instanton - generated potential for the axion field , which is a pseudo - goldstone boson of the peccei - quinn symmetry .",
    "quantum gravity is not believed to exhibit any _ exact _ global symmetries , and even very small , planck - suppressed , violations of the peccei - quinn symmetry will spoil the axion solution of the strong cp problem @xcite . in string theory , it is possible to obtain global symmetries which are exact up to violation by instanton effects . in this sense",
    "the axion solution of the strong cp problem is generally considered to be very natural in string theory ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "however , the axion mass scale , which is determined by a compactification scale , is generally very close to the four - dimensional planck scale .",
    "this conflicts with some standard cosmological arguments which say that such a scale should be no bigger than about @xmath8 gev .    in our model",
    "we are left with an exactly massless goldstone boson @xcite .",
    "this goldstone boson is not an axion ( which would have a non - zero mass ) , and our solution is not the standard axion solution of the strong cp problem . a simple way to understand why we are left with an exactly massless scalar field is to recall that the new colored and uncolored fermions @xmath3 and @xmath7 have zero mass .",
    "this prevents the goldstone boson from acquiring a mass term .",
    "unlike in axion models , the symmetry breaking scale associated with the goldstone boson can be taken to be arbitrarily large , effectively decoupling it from ordinary particles .",
    "the model we consider is described in the accompanying table and figure .",
    "( generalizations are straightforward . )",
    "it contains the symmetry groups @xmath9 and the additional particles @xmath3 and @xmath7 , which are in the fundamental and adjoint representation of @xmath4 , respectively . the @xmath10 color symmetry of qcd is the vector subgroup @xmath11 of @xmath12 , so that qcd gauge transformations correspond to simultaneous transformations with @xmath13 .",
    "each of @xmath4 and @xmath14 ( or equivalently , @xmath15 ) are gauged .",
    "additional @xmath16 axial charges and symmetries are listed .",
    "the anomaly - free linear combination , denoted @xmath17 is gauged .",
    "note that in the table we have suppressed the standard model flavor index @xmath18 ( i.e. , @xmath19 up , down , strange , ... top ) .",
    "c||cccccccc & @xmath4 & @xmath20 & @xmath21 & @xmath22&@xmath17&@xmath23&@xmath24&@xmath25 +   + @xmath26 & adj & @xmath27 & @xmath27 & @xmath28&@xmath27&@xmath27&@xmath29&@xmath29 +   + @xmath30 & @xmath31 & @xmath32 & @xmath27 & @xmath27&@xmath33&@xmath29 & @xmath27 & @xmath29 +   + @xmath34 & @xmath32 & @xmath27 & @xmath31&@xmath35 & @xmath33&@xmath29&@xmath27&@xmath29 +   + @xmath36 & @xmath27&@xmath31 & @xmath27 & @xmath37 & @xmath38 & @xmath29 & @xmath29&@xmath27 +   + @xmath39 & @xmath27&@xmath27 & @xmath32&@xmath40 & @xmath38&@xmath29&@xmath29&@xmath27 +    gauging @xmath41 , as well as @xmath17 , precludes the usual standard model masses for the quarks @xmath42 .",
    "these have the form ( suppressing all indices except those of @xmath43 ) : @xmath44 which under a general @xmath43 transformation becomes @xmath45 the quark mass ( [ qmass ] ) is invariant under @xmath46 , transformations , which have @xmath13 , but not under @xmath41 .",
    "hence , the usual higgs coupling to quarks is forbidden by gauge symmetry ; the interaction which gives masses to quarks must involve additional particles charged under both @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    to overcome this restriction , we postulate a field @xcite @xmath47 which transforms as @xmath48 under @xmath43 , carries @xmath17 charge @xmath49 ( @xmath50 to insure gauge anomaly cancellations ) , and is a singlet under electroweak symmetries .",
    "@xmath47 couples to quarks via the higher dimension operator @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the usual higgs boson . which transforms as @xmath48 under @xmath43 , carries @xmath17 charge @xmath49 ( @xmath50 to insure gauge anomaly cancellations ) , and has the electroweak charges of the ordinary higgs ( i.e. , it is a doublet under @xmath53 )",
    ". then , quark masses result from an interaction of the form @xmath54 . in this case",
    "@xmath55 must be of order the electroweak scale @xcite , which is probably ruled out since the goldstone boson would be detectable ] the potential for @xmath47 must be chosen so that @xmath47 develops a vacuum expectation value .",
    "the goldstone boson mentioned in the introduction is a linear combination of the phase of @xmath47 and that of the quark condensate @xmath56 . in this case",
    "the vev of @xmath47 can be much larger than the electroweak scale since the breaking of electroweak symmetry is solely due to the ordinary higgs @xmath52 .",
    "note that we do not allow interactions among @xmath47 and @xmath57 leading to a mass term for @xmath3 .",
    "that is , we assume that the @xmath24 symmetry is only violated by the anomaly ( i.e. , instanton effects ) .",
    "this is similar to the assumption made about the peccei - quinn symmetry in axion models",
    ".    the condensate @xmath58 spontaneously breaks @xmath59 , where the unbroken subgroup is qcd . the axial subgroup @xmath41 is spontaneously broken , and the corresponding goldstone bosons are eaten , leading to massive @xmath41 gauge bosons .",
    "it is dynamically preferred for the @xmath47 condensate to align with @xmath60 in the @xmath43 internal space , since when they are not aligned color is broken and gluons become massive . as reviewed in @xcite , the contribution to the vacuum energy from higgsed gauge bosons is larger than that from massless gauge bosons , which generically leads to groundstates with maximal unbroken gauge symmetry .",
    "we expect the colored excitations associated with rotations of @xmath55 relative to @xmath61 in the @xmath43 to have mass much larger than the weak or tev scale since the @xmath47 dynamics is unrelated to electroweak breaking .",
    "we also expect the @xmath7 field to condense and spontaneously break @xmath17 , so that any states containing @xmath7 constituents have masses at least of order @xmath5 .      before describing the low energy theory it is instructive to display explicitly the uv theory corresponding to the fields shown in the table .",
    "the fermion kinetic terms are given by :    @xmath62    with @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath65 are left handed weyl fermions .",
    "@xmath66 represents the electroweak quark doublet , while @xmath67 and @xmath68 in the notation of the table .",
    "the generation index for the ordinary quarks is not explicitly shown .",
    "more explicitly , the kinetic terms for the new fermions are : @xmath69 @xmath70 are the gauge bosons of the color left and color right gauge interactions with @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath72 , with @xmath73 , are the gauge bosons of the new strong interaction .",
    "@xmath74 is the gauge boson of the anomaly free @xmath17 gauge symmetry . for the ordinary quarks the kinetic terms",
    "are : @xmath75 here we have indicated for illustration the interactions with the electroweak gauge bosons @xmath76 , but neglected the hypercharge gauge boson .",
    "@xmath77 is the total number of quark flavors . to this lagrangian one",
    "has to add the kinetic term for the new gauge bosons and the modified yukawa interactions which lead to masses for the ordinary fermions .",
    "as mentioned earlier we are now forced to introduce another complex scalar field transforming under the left and right color transformations : @xmath78 .",
    "the resulting yukawa interactions are : @xmath79 @xmath80 is a scale related to the @xmath47 sector of the theory while @xmath81 is the standard electroweak doublet @xmath82",
    ". other nicer ways of providing mass to the ordinary quarks can , of course , be explored - a more general structure of the yukawa couplings in flavor space might be expected . with this choice of the yukawa sector the leptonic sector of",
    "the standard model remains unmodified .",
    "it should also be clear that @xmath47 must condense for the ordinary quarks to acquire a mass .    the @xmath4 gauge theory , being vector like , is free from gauge anomalies .",
    "since we independently gauge @xmath83 we also need to cancel the associated gauge anomalies .",
    "the simplest way is to construct a vector like theory with respect to each gauge group .",
    "this can be easily achieved by setting @xmath84 , i.e. equal to the number of ordinary quark flavors . for @xmath84 ( recalling the 6 flavors of quarks @xmath85 )",
    "we see that in each vertical column of the table corresponding to a non - abelian group the particle content is vector like .    as for the summary of the dynamics we recall that our model has four independent scales . the scale of the @xmath4 strong dynamics @xmath5 , the scale @xmath80 of the condensation of @xmath47 , the electroweak scale and finally the ordinary qcd confining scale .",
    "we imagine the first two scales to be much larger than the electroweak scale . below the @xmath4 confining scale , as explained in the previous section , @xmath86 breaks spontaneously to @xmath11 .",
    "we identify @xmath11 with ordinary color interactions . the effective low energy theory below the @xmath5 scale - but remaining above the electroweak scale - is obtained by replacing the @xmath4 uv theory with its low energy chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the goldstone modes ( massless colored pions ) become longitudinal components of the axial vector bosons and hence , in the end , disappear from the low energy theory .",
    "a similar fate is shared by the goldstone boson associated to the gauged exact @xmath17 symmetry . since @xmath87 are massless we have no @xmath4 theta term . by construction",
    "@xmath3 carries ordinary color and we stress that , without invoking any chiral rotation of the ordinary quarks , the qcd @xmath0 term becomes unphysical ( see next sections for a formal proof ) .",
    "this is the main point of our paper .    at the electroweak scale",
    ", having already assumed the condensation of the field @xmath47 at some energy @xmath80 less than or of order the confining scale of @xmath4 , one generates a mass term for the standard fermions via yuakawa interactions . in general",
    "the couplings are complex and one might be worried that they regenerate a strong cp phase at low energies .",
    "although the formal proof is provided in a following section we can immediately argue that such a strong cp phase can not appear .",
    "this is _ independent _ of the mechanism we use to give masses to the ordinary quarks . to demonstrate this we can first perform a non - abelian chiral rotation which brings all the quarks to the same complex phase",
    "then we are left with an axial transformation which , due to the quark axial anomaly , potentially leads to a new strong cp phase .",
    "however we are free to perform an equivalent axial transformation of the @xmath3 quarks to offset the strong cp phase again .",
    "unfortunately , we were forced to introduce another field @xmath47 which also carries a new phase . in the absence of the @xmath7 and @xmath3 fields",
    "this would lead to a conventional axion field solution to the strong cp problem .",
    "however as we shall demonstrate below the would - be axion in our model is exactly massless .",
    "it is important to note that our mechanism for rotating away the strong cp phase does _ not _ require this extra @xmath47 field and the hope is that a model similar to ours can be constructed in which such a field is not needed .",
    "we now construct the low energy effective theory for the pseudoscalar particles associated with the axial @xmath16 symmetries in our model . at energies above the electroweak scale we have the two condensates @xmath88 and",
    "we hence expect two independent pseudoscalars , one from each condensate , which are singlets of the @xmath90 non - abelian symmetries : @xmath91 by @xmath92 we denote @xmath93 and @xmath94 is @xmath95 .",
    "the decay constants @xmath96 and @xmath97 are comparable in size and of the order of the confining scale of the @xmath4 gauge theory .",
    "since the confining scale of @xmath4 is much larger than the electroweak scale the massive scalar excitations will not appear in the low - energy theory .",
    "the instanton - induced effective potential , which preserves the @xmath17 symmetry , is @xmath98 with @xmath99 a constant .",
    "this potential determines the linear combination of pseudoscalars which becomes massive .",
    "the orthogonal combination remains massless .",
    "it is absorbed in the longitudinal component of the @xmath17 gauge boson and hence decouples from the low energy physics .",
    "the @xmath4 @xmath0 angle is rendered an unphysical quantity since @xmath87 are exactly massless .    at much lower energies",
    "we include the effects of the ordinary quarks .",
    "to give mass to the fermions while preserving the @xmath17 symmetry we introduced the field @xmath47 .",
    "note that , even in the presence of a mass term for the quarks , the qcd theta angle is unobservable , since the massless @xmath87 fields allow us to rotate away _ both _ the @xmath4 and qcd theta angles .",
    "( we discuss this issue further in the following subsections . )",
    "the phase of @xmath47 combines with the phase of @xmath56 yielding a massless goldstone boson and a massive pseudo - goldstone boson .",
    "the latter is the @xmath100 meson of qcd . to show this one can use either current algebra techniques @xcite or the effective lagrangian approach @xcite .",
    "we present here the effective lagrangian approach .",
    "the two new pseudoscalars are related to the phase @xmath101 of @xmath102 and @xmath103 of @xmath104 . at very low energies , below the qcd scale",
    ", we deduce the following effective potential , where we restrict our attention to pseudoscalar fields ( recall @xmath105 is the number of quark flavors , not a decay constant ) : @xmath106>|e^{if(h+\\eta_q ) } + { \\rm h.c . } \\ . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last term is the ordinary instanton - induced fermion determinant .",
    "it is clear that the only combination which acquires a mass is @xmath107 . here",
    "@xmath101 stands for @xmath108 and @xmath103 for @xmath109 .",
    "the linear combination shown in the potential is the standard @xmath100 of qcd , while the orthogonal combination @xmath110 remains massless .",
    "we stress that @xmath110 is a true massless goldstone boson , not an axion of the usual type . while the qcd @xmath0 angle has become _ dynamical _ , in the form of the massless linear combination , the presence of the massless fermions @xmath111 and @xmath7 has rendered physics independent of @xmath0 , and hence the potential for the massless combination flat .",
    "the result is similar to that of an axion model that _ also _ has a massless quark , except in this case it is the @xmath3 and @xmath7 fields which play the role of the massless quark . in usual axion models , two different linear combinations of the axion field and @xmath103",
    "appear : one induced by the mass term of the quarks and the other due to instantons @xcite .",
    "this leads to both a massive axion and a massive @xmath112 , unlike in our model .",
    "gauge theory .",
    "the left ( right ) node indicates @xmath113 .",

    "the axial gauge bosons can be integrated out . in this limit",
    "the field strength @xmath123 appearing on the rhs of equations ( [ awi ] ) is just the usual qcd gluon field strength .",
    "the anomalous ward identities ( [ awi ] ) imply that axial rotations of the @xmath7 field are equivalent to shifts of the @xmath4 @xmath0 angle ( henceforth denoted @xmath124 ) .",
    "axial rotations of @xmath3 shift @xmath124 as well as the @xmath14 angles denoted @xmath125 , while @xmath42 rotations only shift @xmath125 .",
    "it is clear that we can eliminate @xmath124 by appropriate @xmath7 rotation .",
    "@xmath125 are discussed below .",
    "the partition function of our model is @xmath126_\\mu \\left [ da_l \\right]_\\nu \\left [ da_r \\right]_{\\nu ' } ~e^{-s(a_l , a_r , b ) } \\nonumber   \\\\ & & \\times ~{\\rm det } \\",

    "the measure of the integral has been divided into winding number sectors , where the @xmath14 winding numbers are given by @xmath127 , and the @xmath4 winding number is @xmath128 .",
    "it is convenient to define : @xmath129 the left - right symmetry of our model suggests that @xmath130 implying that the physics is insensitive to @xmath131 .",
    "to arrive at the same conclusion we can use the following dynamical argument . due to the higgs mechanism ,",
    "the axial gauge fields @xmath132 are heavy . at low energies their fluctuations",
    "are suppressed , or equivalently : @xmath133 .",
    "consequently , @xmath134 , which implies that @xmath131 is an unphysical parameter .",
    "we can then concentrate on the remaining angles : @xmath135 and the usual qcd @xmath0 . here",
    "we can use the index theorem relating the number of chiral zero modes of the @xmath7 dirac operator to the pontryagin index : @xmath136 for the @xmath3 operator , we have @xmath137 and for the @xmath42 operator @xmath138 here @xmath139 denotes the number of zero modes of chirality @xmath140 . because @xmath3 and @xmath7 are massless , their determinants vanish whenever there are any zero modes - in other words , if _ any _ of the respective @xmath139 are non - zero .",
    "the condition of non - vanishing determinants requires @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "the only topological sectors that can contribute have @xmath143 .",
    "this means that the partition function is independent of both @xmath0 and @xmath124 - they are unphysical parameters .",
    "note also that it is sufficient that @xmath7 and @xmath3 are massless to completely rotate away @xmath0 and @xmath135 .",
