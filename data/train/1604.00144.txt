    "the study of young low - metallicity clusters is of great interest because they enable us to characterize the metallicity dependence of star formation processes , such as the initial mass function ( imf ) and star formation efficiency .",
    "also , the study of the disk fraction for young clusters can constrain the probability of planet formation .",
    "they also provide an opportunity to study star formation in the early universe and to understand the star formation process itself @xcite .",
    "although nearby dwarf galaxies , such as the large megallanic cloud ( lmc ) and the small megallanic cloud ( smc ) , have been the primary targets of such studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , our galaxy also harbors a variety of low - metallicity clusters that enable the study of such objects with unprecedented detail .",
    "the thin disk of our galaxy is known to have a metallicity gradient , lower in the outer galaxy , as well as other spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "although the existence of the metallicity gradient in the inner galaxy ( @xmath7kpc ) is still under debate , a trend toward low metallicity can generally be seen in the outer galaxy @xcite . for the derivation of the metallicity ,",
    "various kinds of objects are used , including b - type stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , cepheid ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and open clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) . among these objects ,",
    "regions have been found over a wide range of galactic radii beginning long ago through a variety of h@xmath8 emission surveys , starting with the pioneering work by @xcite .",
    "@xcite compiled a catalog of 313 regions that is comprehensive for north of decl .",
    "@xmath927@xmath10 , covering the galactic longitudes of 0272deg and 315360deg .",
    "the galactrocentric distance of the regions span from @xmath30 to 18kpc .",
    "considering that regions are excited by o- or b - type stars with very short lifetimes of @xmath320myr at most , a large number of them are star - forming regions ( @xmath370% , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we selected seven regions with estimated low metallicity , [ o / h@xmath11 \\le -0.5$]dex , in the literature to construct a sample of low - metallicity young clusters .    in a series of papers , we present observations regarding the properties of young , low - metallicity clusters . in the first paper @xcite , we presented the results for sh 2 - 207 ( s207 ) , which is an region with a @xmath32.5arcmin radius in the second galactic quadrant with a metallicity of @xmath90.8dex . in the western region of s207 , we identified a young cluster with a @xmath31arcmin radius ( corresponding to 1.3pc ) and a limiting magnitude of @xmath12mag ( 10@xmath2 ) that corresponds to a mass detection limit of @xmath130.1@xmath4 .",
    "the age and distance of the cluster are estimated at 23myr and @xmath34kpc , respectively .",
    "the observed @xmath14-band luminosity function ( klf ) suggests that the underlying imf of the cluster down to the detection limit is not significantly different from typical imfs in the solar metallicity .",
    "based on the fraction of stars with near - infrared ( nir ) excesses , a low disk fraction ( @xmath1510% ) in the cluster with the relatively young age is suggested .    in this paper , we present the results for the second target , sh 2 - 208 ( s208 ) , which is one of the lowest - metallicity star - forming regions in the galaxy with @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "s208 is located @xmath310arcmin southward of s207 .",
    "the two clusters consist of an ideal pair for studying low - metallicity clusters because their proximity in on - sky position and identical metallicities suggest that they are in similar environments .",
    "the combination of the s207 and s208 clusters may enable a unique study of the evolution of imf and other star formation parameters ( e.g. , disk fraction , which is strongly related to the formation rate of the protoplanetary disk ) in low - metallicity environments .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 describes previous studies on s208 and its star - forming activities using _ wise ( wide - field infrared survey explorer ) _ and 2mass ( two micron all sky survey ) data .",
    "section  3 describes subaru moircs ( multi - object infrared camera and spectrograph ) deep @xmath17 images and data reduction .",
    "section  4 describes the results for a star - forming cluster in s208 . in section  5",
    ", we discuss the implications for the basic cluster parameters , such as age , distance , imf , and disk fraction .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : sfinoa ] , we discuss the formation of those clusters in the outer arm in the galactic context .",
    "in this section , the properties of the target star - forming region , s208 , are summarized . in table  [ tab : targets ] , we summarize the properties from previous works : the coordinate , distance , oxygen abundance , and metallicity .",
    "we also show nir and mid - infrared ( mir ) pseudocolor images of s208 in figure  [ fig:3col_2mass_wise ] .",
    "s208 is located at @xmath18 on the galactic plane with coordinates of @xmath19 from simbad @xcite .",
    "it has an extended region traced by h@xmath8 emission @xcite and radio continuum emission @xcite .",
    "it also accompanies strong mir emission that is detected with iras ( iras 04156 + 5251 in the iras point source catalog ; @xcite ) .",
    "co emission is reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a star - forming cluster is identified by @xcite using 2mass images , with the center of @xmath20 and the angular dimensions of 1.2@xmath21 .",
    "the photometric distance , which is determined from spectroscopic and photometric observations , is estimated to be @xmath229kpc on average for a probable dominantly exciting late o - type or early b - type star , gsc 03719 - 00517 ( 7.6kpc by @xcite , 9.4kpc by @xcite , 10.0kpc by @xcite ; see the blue plus in figure  [ fig:3col_2mass_wise ] ) .",
    "assuming that the galactocentric distance of the sun is @xmath23kpc , then the distance corresponds to @xmath24kpc .",
    "it should be noted that the distance from such early - type stars may not be accurate because the luminosity class can not be easily identified for early - type stars . on the other hand ,",
    "the kinematic distance of s208 is estimated at about 4kpc based on observations of the h@xmath8 radial velocity using a fabry ",
    "perot spectrometer ( 4.0kpc by @xcite , 4.1kpc by @xcite ) , and from radial velocities of data by cgps and @xmath25co line data by fcrao ( 4.4kpc by @xcite ) . in this case",
    ", the distance corresponds to @xmath26kpc .",
    "figure  [ fig : gal ] shows a top view of the galaxy with s208 and the spiral arms .",
    "the locations of s208 , assuming the photometric distance and kinematic distance , are shown with the open circle and the filled circle , respectively , while the spiral arms are shown with different colors , e.g. , red for the norma  cygnus ( outer ) arm .",
    "the figure shows that s208 is located beyond the outer arm in the case of photometric distance , whereas it is located around the outer arm in the case of the kinematic distance .",
    "later , we will propose that the distance to this cluster is more likely 4kpc based on klf analysis , which is similar to the above kinematic distance .",

    "subsequently , @xcite derived the oxygen abundance ( o / h ) , as well as the extinctions , electron densities and temperatures , and ionic abundances ( o@xmath30/h@xmath30 , o@xmath31/h@xmath30 , and he@xmath30/h@xmath30 ) .",

    "deep @xmath17-band images were obtained for each band with the 8.2 m subaru telescope equipped with a wide - field nir camera and spectrograph , moircs .",

    "on 2006 november 8 ut , it was highly humid ( @xmath34575% ) , while cirrus was sometimes seen on 2008 january 14 ut . because the detector output linearity is not guaranteed for counts over @xmath320,000adu , we obtained short - exposure images in addition to long - exposure images for more sensitive detection .",

    "in the pseudocolor image of the observed field with moircs ( figure  [ fig:3col_s208 ] ) , we detected a star cluster in the central region of s208 from the enhancement of stellar density compared to that of the surrounding area , which is reported in @xcite .",

    "the suggested distance of the s208 cluster is consistent with the kinematic distance and with s208 being located in the outer arm , as described in section  [ sec : properties ] .",
    "this is also the case for s207 ( see @xcite ) , except that s207 is slightly older ( @xmath323myr ) .",

    "the high column density suggests a quite young age .",
    "however , for a more precise distribution of the co molecular cloud relative to the cluster , co mapping with high sensitivity will be necessary in the future .    in section  [ sec : cc ] , the average extinction of stars in the s208 cluster is estimated at @xmath108mag with a peak of @xmath1098mag .",
    "considering @xmath110mag for the foreground extinction in the direction of s208 , which was estimated from a three - dimensional extinction map of the galactic plane @xcite , the average intrinsic extinction of the s208 cluster is estimated at @xmath111mag .",
    "generally , the average extinction is higher for younger clusters : @xmath112mag for ngc 2024 ( @xmath30.5myr old ) by @xcite ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , @xmath113mag for orion trapezium ( @xmath31myr old ) by @xcite , @xmath114mag for ic 348 ( 2.5myr old ) by @xcite , and @xmath115mag for ngc 2264 ( 3myr old ) by @xcite .",
    "the s208 cluster shows the high extinction that is similar to ngc 2024 and trapezium , suggesting that the age of the s208 cluster is quite young , @xmath30.51myr . because extinctions can be estimated lower considering the low metallicity of s208 ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , the actual gas mass may be larger , implying that the s208 cluster is even younger .    in the klf fitting",
    "( section  [ sec : age_distance ] ) , a typical imf is assumed for estimating the age of the s208 cluster .",
    "we found that the estimated age ( @xmath30.5myr ) is consistent with the above roughly estimated age based on independent information .",
    "this suggests that the imf of the s208 cluster , which is located in very low - metallicity environments , can be approximated by the typical imfs of the solar neighborhood ( @xmath30dex ) for the mass range of @xmath1160.2@xmath4 .",
    "because the klf slope on the bright side is very sensitive to the higher - mass slope of the imf , the good fit of the observed klf down to the peak at @xmath117mag suggests that the higher - mass slope of the imf is not significantly different from typical imfs .",
    "the characteristic mass ( @xmath118 ) , which is the mass of the imf peak corresponding to the peak of the klf , is estimated at @xmath30.6@xmath4 for the age of 0.5myr .",
    "this is identical to the characteristic mass of the imf in the solar neighborhoood , @xmath119@xmath4 ( @xmath120 ; @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , the universal imf has also been suggested in our previous studies of other young clusters in low - metallicity environments , cloud 2-n , -s clusters , and s207 @xcite .",
    "the ratio of stars with protoplanetary disks in young clusters , the disk fraction , is one of the most fundamental parameters characterizing disk formation and evolution , and ultimately planet formation . on the _ jhk _ color  color diagram , stars without circumstellar disks",
    "are seen as main - sequence stars reddened with extinction , whereas stars with circumstellar disks are seen in `` the disk - excess region , '' which is the orange highlighted region to the right of the dot  dashed line in figure  [ fig : cc_s208 ] because of thermal emissions from a hot dust disk with a temperature of @xmath31500k .",
    "the dot  dashed line intersecting the dwarf star curve at maximum @xmath85 values ( m6 point on the curve ) and is parallel to the reddening vector is the border between stars with and without circumstellar disks ( see details in @xcite ) .",
    "the disk fraction for identified cluster members with more than 10@xmath2 detection for all @xmath17 bands is estimated at 27@xmath66% ( 24/89 ) from figure  [ fig : cc_s208 ] .    in figure",

    "the distribution becomes bluer and sharper with lower disk fractions for nearby young clusters ( see the bottom panel of figure  7 in @xcite ) , which is also the case for clusters in low - metallicity environments @xcite .",

    "the distribution of the s208 cluster resembles that of the cloud 2-s cluster with a disk fraction of @xmath325% rather than those of the s207 cluster and the cloud 2-n cluster with a disk fraction of @xmath1510% .",
    "the distribution of the s208 cluster is consistent with the estimated disk fraction , 27@xmath66% .",
    "nir disk fractions are known to have high values ( @xmath360% ) for very young clusters but decrease with increasing age , and then reach @xmath3510% on a timescale of @xmath310myr ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; see the red line in the left panel of fig  5 in @xcite ) .",
    "although nir disk fractions are generally slightly lower than mir disk fractions , which are based on ground @xmath125-band observations and space mir observations , the characteristics are quite similar . as suggested in @xcite , the derived disk fraction for the s208 cluster ( 27@xmath66% ) is lower than that for clusters in the solar neighborhood with ages similar to the s208 cluster s age ( @xmath360% for @xmath151myr ) .",
    "the lower disk fraction in low - metallicity environments suggests that the disk lifetime in low - metallicity environments is quite short , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that only the s208 cluster has very red stars with @xmath126mag in figure  [ fig : hk0_disk ] .",
    "this may be because the cluster is the youngest among those in figure  [ fig : hk0_disk ] : the estimated age of the s208 cluster is @xmath30.5myr ( section  [ sec : age_distance ] ) , while those of the cloud 2-n , cloud 2-s , and s207 clusters are 0.51myr , 0.51myr , and 23myr , respectively ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "very young ysos that are surrounded by thick circumstellar envelopes of falling material , called class i sources , are known to show very red nir colors @xcite .",
    "although the classification of sources between class i and class ii ( ysos surrounded by optically thick circumstellar disks ) can not be perfectly distinguished using the _ jhk _ color - color diagram , many of the class i sources in ngc 2024 are located in the disk - excess region and have large @xmath127 colors ( equal to the sum of @xmath84 ( y - axis ) and @xmath86 ( x - axis ) colors ) of larger than @xmath33 ( see left panel of figure  8 in @xcite ) . the same trend is seen in the taurus star - forming region .",
    "the s208 cluster has four objects with such colors .",
    "our results suggest that ysos in low - metallicity environments are initially surrounded by thick circumstellar envelopes , as is the case for the solar neighborhood , but the circumstellar material as well as the disk disperse very quickly .",

    "s207 is located in the upper right in the figure , while s208 is located in the lower left , @xmath310arcmin southward of s207 . since the identical distances of s207 and s208 , @xmath34kpc , are supported both from the kinematic distance and from the klf fitting ( section  5.1 in @xcite for s207 , and section  [ sec : age_distance ] for s208 ) , the actual separation is suggested to be very small , 12pc .",
    "based on the distance , their galactrocentric distances are estimated at @xmath26kpc , suggesting that both clusters are located in the outer arm ( figure  [ fig : gal ] ) .",
    "the fact that the kinematic distance is consistent with the photometric ( klf ) distance may support the suggestion that sources in the outer arm are in nearly circular galactic orbits ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    because the estimated metallicities of both clusters are also almost identical , @xmath90.8dex ,",
    "the star - formation activities in the two clusters are suggested to originate in a similar environment , except that they are at different evolutionary stages : s207 is suggested to be at the end of the embedded cluster phase ( @xmath323myr ) , while s208 is suggested to be in a very young phase ( @xmath30.5myr ) from the klf fitting .",
    "this is also suggested from the nir pseudocolor images , the bluer colors of the s207 cluster ( figure  1 , bottom in @xcite ) , and the redder colors of the s208 cluster ( see figure  [ fig:3col_s208 ] ) .",
    "the differences in the following two star - forming properties of the star formation support the difference in the cluster ages .",
    "( i ) cluster size .",
    "the cluster size is suggested to be larger with increasing ages due to proper motions of individual stars @xcite .",
    "this is the case for the s207 and s208 clusters : the sizes are about 1.3pc and 0.7pc in radius , respectively .",
    "these radii are consistent with those in the cluster samples of @xcite , in which many of them are nearby clusters ( see figure  2b in @xcite ) .",
    "( ii ) size of an region .",
    "size of an region is known to become larger with an increasing age @xcite .",
    "this is the case for s207 and s208 : the radius of 3pc for s207 and that of 1.2pc for s208 from the 1.4ghz radio continuum .",
    "an h@xmath8 image ( figure  [ fig:3col_wise ] , right ) from the iphas survey @xcite around s207 and s208 also shows the clear difference in size of the two regions .",
    "@xcite inferred the age of the region with the assumption of a uniform pressure within the ionized region . according to this model , the age",
    "is estimated to be 0.2myr for s207 and 0.1myr for s208 assuming an original ambient density of @xmath130 @xmath131 and a flux of ionizing photons for the regions ( @xmath132 ) of @xmath133s@xmath44 emitted from a b0v star ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although this age estimate is crude because the assumption of evolution in a strictly uniform medium is unrealistic @xcite , the trends in the size of the region for s207 and s208 should reflect the age sequence .",

    "bubbles are thought to be one of the major triggers of star formation ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "the bubble feature is not significant in the higher latitudes , while the feature is prominent in the lower latitudes .",
    "also , many possible star - forming regions are distributed in the lower latitude on the line extending to s207 , s208 ( the s208 cluster and the s208 association ) , wat 1 , and many iras point sources . because the radial velocity of wat 1 is comparable to those of s207 and s208 , wat 1 is suggested to actually be located at the identical distance @xcite .",
    "the positional relationship between s207 , s208 , and possible star - forming regions suggests that the bubble also triggers star formation in the lower latitudes and that sequential star formation is occurring .",
    "this is consistent with the age difference between the s207 cluster and the s208 cluster , i.e. , younger in the s207 and older in s208 .",
