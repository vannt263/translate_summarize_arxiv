    "rapid , inherently irreversible dynamics is a practical concern in producing high - brightness charged - particle beams .",
    "time scales of irreversible processes place constraints on methods for compensating against degradation of beam quality caused by , for example , space charge .",
    "this is a very important practical matter because compensation must be fast compared to these processes , and this affects the choice and configuration of the associated hardware .",
    "a beam bunch with space charge comprises an @xmath0-body system with typically 3@xmath0 degrees of freedom .",
    "upon coarse - graining , i.e. , `` smoothing '' the system to remove granularity , the collective space - charge force remains .",
    "one might conjecture that this force , when nonlinear , may support chaotic orbits .",
    "one example is the university of maryland five - beamlet experiment that shows presumably irreversible dissipation of the beamlets after a few space - charge - depressed betatron periods  @xcite .",
    "simulations of the experiment reveal a substantial fraction of globally chaotic orbits  @xcite , and phase mixing of these orbits thereby presents itself as a contributing evolutionary mechanism .",
    "this example pertains to a strongly time - dependent nonequilibrium system , yet one might conjecture that nonlinear space - charge forces in a static system could support chaotic orbits as well .",
    "we shall explore this conjecture .",
    "an initially localized clump of chaotic orbits will , via phase mixing , grow exponentially and eventually reach an invariant distribution .",
    "this is `` chaotic mixing ''  @xcite . strictly speaking ,",
    "the process is reversible in that it is collisionless and its dynamics is included in , e.g. , vlasov s equation .",
    "nonetheless , when the invariant distribution spans a global region of the system s phase space , chaotic mixing is a legitimate relaxation mechanism in that it drastically smears correlations .",
    "moreover , from a practical perspective , the process is strictly irreversible because infinitesimal fine - tuning is needed to reassemble the initial conditions .",
    "it is also distinctly different from phase mixing of regular orbits , i.e. , linear landau damping  @xcite , a process that winds an initially localized clump into a filament over a comparatively narrow region of phase space .",
    "whereas chaotic mixing proceeds exponentially over a well - defined time scale and can cause global , macroscopic changes in the system , phase mixing of regular orbits carries a power - law time dependence , proceeds on a time scale depending on the distribution of orbital frequencies across the clump , and acts only over a portion of the phase space .",
    "accordingly , ascertaining conditions for , and time scales of , chaotic mixing in beams is an undertaking of practical importance .    in this paper",
    "we consider a family of thermal - equilibrium ( te ) configurations of beam bunches with space charge , i.e. , nonneutral plasmas , confined by linear external forces  @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we treat the dynamics in a reference frame that comoves with the bunch and has its origin affixed to the bunch centroid . particle motion in this reference frame is taken to be nonrelativistic ; transforming from the bunch frame to the laboratory frame is straightforward  @xcite . in the laboratory frame the space - charge force decreases inversely with the square of the beam energy . for the transverse component ,",
    "this arises from the partial cancellation between the self - magnetic and self - electrostatic forces ; while for the longitudinal component , it is due to lorentz contraction  @xcite",
    ". nonetheless , there are many situations involving high - brightness beams wherein space charge is important .",
    "contemporary examples include low - to - medium - energy hadron accelerators such as those that drive spallation - neutron sources or serve as boosters for high - energy machines , heavy - ion accelerators , and low - energy electron accelerators such as photoinjectors  @xcite .",
    "thermal - equilibrium beams are of practical interest in connection with , e.g. , high - current radiofrequency linear accelerators .",
    "while conventional designs of such machines lead to bunches that are out of equilibrium , a design strategy that keeps the beam at or near thermal equilibrium has been formulated  @xcite .",
    "the principal motivation for this alternative strategy is to circumvent equipartitioning processes that cause emittance growth and halo formation .",
    "because a te configuration is a maximum - entropy configuration , is static , and is manifestly stable  @xcite , one might expect its intrinsic dynamics to be entirely benign .",
    "the expectation is questionable .",
    "the density distribution of such a configuration is uniform in its interior and falls to zero over a distance commensurate to the debye length .",
    "thus , large - amplitude orbits will explore this `` debye tail , '' during which time they experience a nonlinear force .",
    "the question we seek to answer is whether the nonlinear force in the debye tail can cause a significant number of orbits to be chaotic .",
    "the answer is unequivocally `` no '' for spherically symmetric or infinitely long cylindrically symmetric configurations because their potentials are integrable and thereby support only regular orbits .",
    "however , breaking the symmetry _ can _ generate chaotic orbits , as will become apparent in the analysis to follow .",
    "our study involves a comprehensive suite of numerical experiments concerning orbital dynamics in smooth ( coarse - grained ) te configurations .",
    "we establish a quantitative measure of chaos in orbits and use this measure to distinguish between regular and chaotic orbits .",
    "we then evolve initially localized clumps of particles in the smooth potentials .",
    "the experiments are fast if the potentials are analytic , but they are much slower if the potentials must first be tabulated numerically over a grid . as part of the preliminaries , sec .",
    "[ sec : mixingtime ] presents a semianalytic theory for estimating the time scale for chaotic mixing . in general the te configurations , specified in sec .",
    "[ sec : te ] , must be found numerically .",
    "section  [ sec : appx ] presents a means for rapidly constructing approximate , semianalytic models of their potentials . with these models we are able to survey the parameter space and obtain a zeroth - order assessment of the prevalence and degree of chaos ; this is done in sec .",
    "[ sec : survey ] .",
    "section  [ sec : exact ] concerns examples for which the potential is accurately determined via a numerical solution of poisson s equation on a grid . for these examples",
    "the experiments of sec .",
    "[ sec : survey ] are repeated , and the results are compared to those derived from the semianalytic approximation .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] summarizes the findings , discusses their implications while providing a comparison with the theory of sec .  [ sec : mixingtime ] , and presents a path for follow - on work .",
    "before embarking on numerical studies , it is wise to ascertain whether chaotic mixing can indeed proceed rapidly .",
    "one can construct an analytic tool to estimate the chaotic - mixing rate , although its application involves the tacit assumption , or initial knowledge , that chaotic orbits are present . in this section",
    "we sketch the methodology leading to analytic predictions .",
    "additional details are available elsewhere  @xcite .    the past few years have seen development of a geometric method proposed by m. pettini to quantify chaotic instability in hamiltonian systems with many degrees of freedom . the central idea is to describe the dynamics in terms of average curvature properties of the manifold in which the particle orbits are geodesics .",
    "the method hinges on the following assumptions and approximations ; they are discussed thoroughly in ref .",
    "@xcite : ( 1 ) a generic geodesic is chaotic ; ( 2 ) the manifold s effective curvature is locally deformed but otherwise constant ; ( 3 ) the effective curvature reflects a gaussian stochastic process ; and ( 4 ) long - time - averaged properties of the curvature are calculable as phase - space averages over an invariant measure , specifically , the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "the gaussian process is the zeroth - order term in a cumulant expansion of the actual stochastic process ; assumption ( 3 ) is that the zeroth - order term suffices .",
    "the end result relates chaotic instability to the geometric properties of the manifold defined by the long - time - averaged orbits . in short",
    ", the theory is based on ( often questionable ) assumptions that chaos exists and is characterized by ergodicity and a microcanonical ensemble , and it treats chaotic orbits as arising from a parametric instability that can be modeled by a stochastic - oscillator equation .",
    "it has recently been adapted for application to low - dimensional , autonomous ( time - independent ) hamiltonian systems and , in tests against a wide variety of such systems , it was found commonly to yield estimates of mixing rates that are good to within a factor @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "action principles in classical mechanics are tantamount to extremals of `` arc lengths '' ; thus , one can infer a metric tensor from an action principle  @xcite .",
    "the metric tensor manifests all of the properties of the manifold over which the system evolves , with these properties being calculable following standard methods of differential geometry .",
    "of special interest is the divergence of two initially nearby @xmath2-dimensional geodesics @xmath3 and @xmath4 as governed by the equation of geodesic deviation : @xmath5 in which @xmath6 denotes covariant differentiation with respect to the `` proper time '' @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the riemann tensor derivable from the metric tensor , and summation over repeated indices is implied with each index spanning the @xmath2 degrees of freedom .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : geodev ] ) is the basis for determining the mixing rate @xmath9 as a measure of the system s largest lyapunov exponent , a quantity that reflects the long - time behavior of the separation vector : @xmath10    any number of action principles , and therefore any number of metric tensors , can be selected to proceed further .",
    "eisenhart s metric  @xcite , which is consistent with hamilton s least - action principle , is probably the most convenient choice .",
    "it offers easy calculation of the riemann tensor , and it avoids spurious results traceable to the singular boundary of the perhaps better - known jacobi metric that is derivable from maupertius least - action principle  @xcite .",
    "eisenhart s metric operates over an enlarged configuration space - time manifold in which the geodesics are parameterized by the real time @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath12 , in which @xmath13 is the potential energy per unit mass ( hereafter called the `` potential '' ) ; @xmath14 ( with the indices @xmath15 running from @xmath16 to @xmath2 ) is the unit tensor corresponding ( without loss of generality ) to a cartesian spatial coordinate system , @xmath17 ; @xmath18 ; and @xmath19 is the lagrangian .",
    "the resulting geodesic equations for the spatial coordinates @xmath20 are newton s equations of motion , so the particle trajectories correspond to a canonical projection of the eisenhart geodesics onto the configuration space - time manifold . a convenient byproduct of the eisenhart",
    "metric is that the only nonzero components of the riemann tensor are @xmath21 , in which @xmath22 .    using the aforementioned assumptions and approximations , pettini and others  @xcite",
    "derive an expression for @xmath9 in terms of the curvature and its standard deviation averaged over the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "the idea is that , as @xmath23 , chaotic orbits of total energy @xmath24 mix through the configuration space toward an invariant measure , taken per assumption ( 4 ) to be the microcanonical ensemble @xmath25 , over which time averages become equivalent to phase - space averages .",
    "specifically , for an arbitrary function @xmath26 , the averaging process is @xmath27 } { \\int d{\\bf q}\\int d\\dot{{\\bf q}}~\\delta[h({\\bf q},\\dot{{\\bf q}})-e]}. \\label{eq : muaverage}\\ ] ] per eisenhart s metric , the average curvature @xmath28 and the ratio @xmath29 , with @xmath30 denoting the standard deviation of the curvature , are @xmath31 in which @xmath32 denotes the laplacian @xmath33 , and @xmath34 corresponds physically to the ratio of the average curvature radius to the length scale of fluctuations  @xcite . by taking the curvature to vary randomly along a chaotic orbit",

    "the solution yields an estimate of the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath9 : @xmath35^{1/3},\\;\\ ; t(\\rho)~=~\\frac{3\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{8}\\frac{\\rho^2}{2\\sqrt{1+\\rho}+\\pi\\rho}. \\label{eq : analyticlyapunov}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the geometric quantities derive from the @xmath36-dimensional microcanonical distribution . anticipating that granularity takes a long time to affect mixing , and wishing to identify conditions for rapid mixing , we now consider the influence of the 3-dimensional coarse - grained space - charge potential @xmath37 on a generic chaotic orbit .",
    "the largest lyapunov exponent for the coarse - grained system equates to the chaotic - mixing rate .",
    "we presume the assumptions and approximations stated at the outset carry over to the coarse - grained system ; the main justification is that the aforementioned previous work concerning low - dimensional autonomous hamiltonians has shown the mixing rate in such systems usually depends only weakly on the dynamical details  @xcite . we take the external focusing potential @xmath38 to be quadratic in the coordinates @xmath39 comoving with the bunch , i.e. , @xmath40 , wherein @xmath41 corresponds to the focusing strength ; the total potential is @xmath42 . per eq",

    "( [ eq : analyticlyapunov ] ) gives the associated time scale for chaotic mixing , @xmath51 .",
    "when the standard deviation of the density distribution is large , as can be the case when substructure is present , @xmath34 will be appreciable , and in turn eq .",
    "( [ eq : analyticlyapunov ] ) makes clear that @xmath52 will be a few space - charge - depressed periods @xmath53 .",
    "accordingly , the space - charge - depressed period , a quantity commensurate to the orbital period of a typical particle , constitutes a `` dynamical time '' @xmath54 for charged - particle beams .    to underscore the potential impact of collision_less _ relaxation via chaotic mixing , it is of interest to compare @xmath52 to the collision_al _ relaxation time @xmath55 .",
    "perhaps the simplest way to develop an order - of - magnitude estimate of @xmath55 in a charged - particle bunch ( a _ non_neutral plasma ) is to calculate the time required for a typical particle velocity to change by of order itself presuming collisions comprise a sum of incoherent binary interactions  @xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath56 , wherein the coulomb logarithm is conservatively taken to be @xmath57 .",
    "if we substitute plausible parameter values for real high - brightness beams , we find @xmath58 ; for example , @xmath59 ( 1 nc ) gives @xmath60 ; hence , @xmath61 when chaotic mixing is prominent .",
    "the remaining question is whether there is a significant population of globally chaotic orbits to mix , a question to which we now turn our attention .",
    "consider a system , i.e. , a bunch , of @xmath62 identical charged particles , e.g. , electrons or protons .",
    "for simplicity , invoke a cartesian coordinate system whose origin lies at the bunch centroid .",
    "assume all particle velocities in this coordinate system are nonrelativistic .",
    "the particles mutually interact via the coulomb force and are confined by a static , externally applied , linear focusing force .",
    "the focusing force may have different strengths along the three cartesian axes .",
    "assume , apart from this focusing force , that the system is isolated and is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "accordingly , the total energy @xmath24 of each particle is conserved : @xmath63 wherein @xmath64 corresponds to the focusing strength ; @xmath65 denotes coordinates ; @xmath48 , @xmath66 , and @xmath47 are the particle s rest mass , speed , and charge , respectively ; and @xmath67 is the space - charge potential arising from the collective coulomb force .    to proceed , one would in principle work with the @xmath36-dimensional microcanonical distribution of particles .",
    "this distribution includes interactions at all scales , ranging from particle - on - particle to a single particle interacting with the bulk , smooth potential from all other particles .",
    "discreteness effects from @xmath68 particle collisions generate chaos  @xcite ; they cause nearby particle trajectories to separate exponentially .",
    "the rate of exponential separation , i.e. , the lyapunov exponent , is an increasing function of @xmath62  @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "larger @xmath62 gives rise to more chaos .",
    "however , the scale at which the separation saturates is a decreasing function of @xmath62 .",
    "accordingly , in large-@xmath62 , high - charge - density systems such as beams with space charge , discreteness establishes @xmath69chaos  @xcite . at the other extreme , that of a single particle interacting with the bulk , smooth potential , exponential separation of nearby chaotic particles ( if any are present ) saturates at a global scale , corresponding to a state of @xmath70chaos .",
    "thus , initially nearby chaotic orbits evolve in three stages  @xcite : ( 1 ) very rapid exponential divergence that saturates at a scale large compared to the initial interparticle spacing but small compared to the system size ; followed by ( 2 ) rapid exponential divergence that persists until the particles are globally dispersed ; followed by ( 3 ) less rapid power - law divergence on a time scale @xmath71 , in which @xmath54 is a dynamical time commensurate to the orbital period . if , in the smooth potential , the initially nearby particles execute regular motion rather than chaotic , then stage ( 2 ) is absent , and stage ( 3 ) proceeds on the much longer time scale @xmath72  @xcite .",
    "our interest here is in stage ( 2 ) .",
    "specifically , we are concerned about the existence of , and time scale for , macroscopic chaos , i.e. , chaotic mixing into the global region of phase space that is energetically accessible to the individual particles .",
    "accordingly , we specialize to the smooth 6-dimensional distribution function of a single particle , recognizing that discreteness effects vanish on macroscopic scales as the number density grows . for the te beam ,",

    "a key challenge in exploring orbital dynamics throughout the parameter space is to integrate large numbers of orbits rapidly for sufficiently long evolutionary times . ideally , one would have analytic solutions for the density - potential pairs , from which the force on a particle at each time step can be quickly evaluated .",
    "unfortunately , the equations of equilibrium generally do not submit to analytic techniques .",
    "thus , in principle , one must solve these equations numerically , e.g. , over a grid .",

    "the integrations were done using a fifth - order runge - kutta algorithm  @xcite with variable time step . as the integration proceeded , we computed the largest short - time lyapunov exponent of each orbit using a well - established algorithm in the field of chaotic dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to evolve two initial conditions that start from a very close distance for about one dynamical time , then renormalize to bring the two particles close together again , and repeat the process until the average exponent associated with the orbital separation converges to an almost stable value .",
    "typically convergence was achieved within @xmath147 orbital periods .",
    "after computing the orbits , we extracted the power spectrum for each orbit using a fast - fourier - transform algorithm  @xcite . in doing so , we recorded each orbit at a rate @xmath148 times per orbital period . from the spectrum we computed the total power .",
    "then we sorted the spectral frequencies in descending order , and starting from the highest frequency we added as many frequencies as were needed to reach 90% of the total power .",
    "the required number of frequencies is defined to be the `` complexity '' @xmath149 of the orbit  @xcite .",
    "our first and foremost interest is to determine how many of the 2000 orbits in our sample are chaotic in a given te configuration .",
    "accordingly an objective , quantitative criterion for chaos is needed .",
    "there is no universally accepted criterion ; hence , we developed our own using the following rationale .",
    "both the largest short - time lyapunov exponent @xmath9 and the complexity @xmath149 are well - established , conventional measures of chaos  @xcite . a first piece of information for defining the criterion comes from plotting @xmath149 versus @xmath9 for all of the orbits .",
    "[ fig : measure ] provides an example .",
    "it shows that ( a ) @xmath149 increases approximately linearly with @xmath9 , as one might expect since both quantities are measures of chaos , and ( b ) the regular orbits occupy a sharply defined region close to the origin of the @xmath149-vs.-@xmath9 plot .",
    "the borders of this `` region of regularity '' thereby offer three possible criteria for chaos : one involving only the lyapunov exponent , one involving only the complexity , and one involving both quantities .    we chose to base our criterion only on the complexity for the following reason .",
    "though no problem arises in computing lyapunov exponents in the zeroth approximation , such is not the case in the exact potential , wherein we found that longer integration times are required to achieve adequate convergence .",
    "recall that the exact potential must be specified over a three - dimensional grid .",
    "accordingly , interpolation errors and discontinuities between the cells can affect computations of lyapunov exponents because they involve the distance between two initially nearby orbits , which is a local property that is sensitive to the grid size and the order of interpolation .",
    "by contrast , a computation of complexity , in that it involves the fourier spectrum of an individual orbit , avoids reference to nearby orbits and is thus a global property influenced little by the grid size , a notion that we corroborated during the course of our numerical studies . for simulations in exact potentials , we chose a grid size and interpolation algorithm ( cf .",
    "[ sec : exact ] below ) such that numerical errors had negligible effect on the computation of individual orbits",
    ". a standard measure of the `` goodness '' of an orbital integration is the degree to which total energy is conserved  @xcite ; for every orbit we achieved conservation of total energy with relative error @xmath150 .",
    "this is some two orders of magnitude better than contemporary standard practice .",
    "investigations of @xmath149-vs.-@xmath9 plots for many zeroth - order te potentials led us to a specific quantitative criterion , namely , an orbit is categorized as chaotic if its complexity @xmath151 [ cf .",
    "[ fig : measure](c ) ] .",
    "this choice was also checked and confirmed by carefully inspecting hundreds of plots of individual orbits in several geometries .",
    "plots of two representative orbits , one regular and one chaotic , as well as their power spectra in the @xmath152-direction and their surfaces of section in the @xmath153 phase space , appear in fig .",

    "the first orbit has @xmath155 and @xmath156 ; the second orbit has @xmath157 and @xmath158 . their differences are striking .",
    "one major difference concerns their power spectra .",
    "the regular orbit exhibits two very distinct frequencies in its spectrum , whereas the chaotic orbit features a near - continuum spanning a large number of frequencies .",
    "the surfaces of section are computed by recording @xmath159 and @xmath160 when @xmath161 .",
    "the regular orbit is seen to stay within a localized region of the @xmath159-vs.-@xmath160 phase space , whereas the chaotic orbit largely fills a global area of phase space commensurate to its total energy .",
    "results of a numerical experiment that highlights the largest lyapunov exponent , i.e. , the rate of global chaotic mixing , appears in fig .",

    "each clump initially occupies a cube of size @xmath163 in the configuration space .",
    "the figure reveals that each clump mixes through a global region of phase space with an e - folding time comparable to a dynamical time @xmath54 , taken here to be the orbital period corresponding to the total energy of the individual particles comprising the clump . after some tens of @xmath54 each clump has spread through a volume commensurate to the total particle energy .",
    "our strategy for surveying the parameter space of the te configurations is as follows .",
    "we conduct the survey using the zeroth - order potential @xmath126 found from eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential1 ] ) . recall that this potential depends on the focusing strength @xmath96 and , through @xmath112 , the scale lengths ( @xmath164 )",
    "; we thus choose a specific parameter set @xmath107 $ ] .",
    "then we integrate 2000 initial conditions generated by uniformly sampling ( 1 ) the volume spanned by the configuration , and afterward ( 2 ) the volume spanned only by the debye tail .",
    "having established the criterion for chaos ( complexity @xmath151 ) , we identify and count the chaotic orbits in the respective sample , and we express this number as a percentage of the sample .",
    "this percentage may be viewed as an indication of the extent to which a given parameter set supports globally chaotic orbits .",
    "however , it should not be taken too literally in that the initial conditions are distributed uniformly through a volume ; they are not weighted by the actual density distribution .",
    "our numerical experiments fall largely into two categories .",
    "category i pertains to keeping @xmath96 fixed to its case 5 value ( intermediate space charge ) , i.e. , @xmath165 in eq .",

    "also shown in the bottom panels of these figures are the initial conditions , projected onto the @xmath167-plane , corresponding to the axisymmetric configurations for which @xmath168 .",
    "in addition , results from analogous experiments in exact potentials are plotted for comparison .",
    "the figures exhibit a number of features .",
    "first and foremost is the indication that most of the configurations support a considerable population of chaotic orbits .",
    "this is true even for axisymmetric configurations , but of course it is not true for spherically symmetric configurations in that their potentials are integrable .",
    "second , orbits for which the initial conditions all lie within the debye tail reflect a higher percentage of chaos than were they distributed through the entire configuration space .",
    "third , prolate axisymmetric configurations ( for which only one datum is shown in each of these figures ) support little chaos .",
    "fourth , for reasons to be elaborated in sec .",
    "[ sec : exact ] below , the exact potentials support less chaos than their zeroth - order counterparts .",
    "further analysis reveals that , for configurations in which they are present , essentially all of the chaotic orbits originate in the debye tail .",
    "figure  [ fig : catidebye ] dramatically illustrates this finding . to assemble this figure ,",
    "the initial conditions are sorted and binned into increments of @xmath136 spanning 0.1 units of length .",
    "then , in each increment , the complexity @xmath149 of every orbit is computed , and the complexities are averaged to obtain @xmath169 .",
    "the process is repeated for all of the increments , and then for many different parameter sets .",
    "the results , @xmath170 versus @xmath136 for case 5 with @xmath168 and several choices of @xmath171 , comprise fig .",
    "[ fig : catidebye ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : catii ] depicts the percentage of orbits for the category ii experiments for which the initial conditions are uniformly distributed over the volume spanned by the configuration .",
    "cases corresponding to intermediate space charge would seem to support more chaos . this finding makes sense when juxtaposed against the limiting cases of zero space charge at one extreme and zero debye tail , i.e. , the uniform beam , at the other extreme . with zero space charge , only the linear forces of the external potential influence the particles . for the uniform beam",
    "the external and space - charge potentials cancel one another so that the particles move freely , apart from reflections at the boundary of the configuration . in both extremes",
    "the orbits are all regular , excepting billiard effects , if any , associated with shapes of boundary surfaces of uniform bunches .",
    "the figure also suggests that prolate , axisymmetric te configurations support little chaos .",
    "as a matter of principle , one must be concerned about the extent to which subtle structure in the potential can influence the qualitative behavior , and in particular the chaoticity , of an orbit .",
    "one well - known example is that of the toda potential ; the full toda potential is integrable and supports only regular orbits , but generally a truncated toda potential is not integrable and supports a population of chaotic orbits  @xcite .",
    "our survey of the parameter space of te configurations centered on the use of @xmath126 , a generally crude approximation to the true potential .",
    "the survey suggests a large region of the parameter space supports sizeable populations of chaotic orbits , wherein all of these orbits reach into the debye tail .",
    "we may expect in general that the density profile , particularly that of the debye tail , corresponding to the exact potential is considerably different from that corresponding to @xmath126 .",
    "for example , in the limit of distances very far from the centroid , the exact space - charge potential will approach spherical symmetry , whereas @xmath126 is everywhere homeoidally striated .",
    "accordingly , to check and have confidence in the qualitative results of sec .",
    "[ sec : survey ] , we must repeat the numerical experiments in a suitably broad collection of exact potentials . as mentioned earlier , the reason we did not base the survey on exact potentials is that the respective numerical experiments are computationally expensive .",
    "to integrate eq .",
    "( [ eq : normpotential ] ) governing the exact potential @xmath108 , which is a fully three - dimensional partial differential equation ( pde ) , we chose a multigrid algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the algorithm requires boundary conditions be specified over the surface of the volume occupied by the grid .",
    "we chose a cubic grid volume greatly exceeding the volume of interest , i.e. , that spanning the debye fall - off of the density",
    ". then we calculated the boundary conditions over the surface of this volume using the formalism of the first approximation , specifically , eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential1 ] ) . because the resulting boundary conditions are only first approximations to the true boundary conditions , we checked our numerical solutions by varying the positions of the bounding surfaces of the grid by factors of five , and we found negligible change in the results over the volume of interest . applying",
    "the multigrid algorithm to three dimensions involves nontrivial manipulations of the inherent restriction , interpolation , and relaxation routines . in the process",
    ", a nonlinear algebraic equation emerges due to the nonlinearity of the pde .",
    "it was solved using an iterative method that combines newton - raphson and bisection techniques  @xcite .    after tabulating the exact potential in three dimensions",
    ", we used a fifth - order runge - kutta algorithm with variable time step to evolve the individual orbits in time , within which the force at every time ( thus position ) step was computed using a three - dimensional interpolation scheme .",
    "the resulting orbits conserved total energy with relative error better than @xmath172 and sometimes as low as @xmath173 .",

    "the top two panels present isopotential contours in the @xmath167-plane for case 5 with @xmath162 , a triaxial configuration .",
    "the bottom panels show how the two potentials compare along each of the ( @xmath174)-axes . obviously there are , and there should be , differences , but the important question is to what extent these differences alter the qualitative evolution of the orbits and , in turn , the complexities that characterize them ? analogous graphs for case 5 and @xmath154 , a strongly oblate spheroid , appear in fig .",
    "[ fig : potcompare2 ] , from which the respective differences are seen to be much more pronounced .",
    "figure  [ fig : orbitcompare ] provides a visual comparison of a chaotic orbit starting from the same initial condition and evolving in the zeroth - order and exact potentials of fig .",
    "[ fig : potcompare1 ] . although orbits in the two potentials differ quantitatively , in many cases they are qualitatively similar in that they explore a similar volume of phase space and have similar morphology .",
    "this pertains to the example of fig .",
    "[ fig : orbitcompare ] ; however , this one example does not in any way guarantee every orbit that is chaotic in the potential of the zeroth approximation is also chaotic in the exact potential .",
    "statistical comparisons of orbital complexities respective to the zeroth - order and exact potentials for several case 5 configurations appear in fig .",
    "[ fig : complexitycompare ] , and these show that the complexities in the two potentials can differ considerably depending on the specific parameter set under study .    following the procedure delineated in sec .",
    "[ subsec : surveyresults ] , we also computed the percentage of chaotic orbits in a broad range of exact case 5 potentials .",
    "the results , juxtaposed against their counterparts computed using @xmath126 , appear in table  i and in figs .",
    "[ fig : catia ] and [ fig : catib ] . for these examples , there is generally a smaller percentage of chaotic orbits in the exact potential than in the zeroth approximation .",
    "the explanation is simple : compared to the density @xmath144 $ ] , the density derived from the exact space - charge potential @xmath108 is quasi - uniform over a larger volume and falls to small values over a shorter scale length . accordingly , the configuration - space volume over which the space - charge force is markedly nonlinear , i.e. , the debye tail , is smaller .",
    "figure  [ fig : densitycompare ] illustrates the difference in the density profiles corresponding to the approximate and exact solutions . in the limit of spherical symmetry the profiles are identical , and they disagree more strongly as they become less spherically symmetric . most notable is the comparison between figs .",
    "[ fig : densitycompare](e ) and ( f ) concerning a strongly oblate spheroid , where we see that the corresponding exact density distribution is much more uniform than that of the zeroth approximation .",
    "this accounts for the strong discrepancy revealed in fig .",
    "[ fig : complexitycompare](d ) concerning orbital chaoticity .",
    "it is also consistent with expectations based on first principles : the closer a system is to being one - dimensional ( e.g. , sphere , cylindrically symmetric disc , infinite symmetric cylinder , in which particle motion is integrable ) , the less is the population of chaotic orbits .",
    "however , the essential observation is that , in most cases , the exact te configurations do indeed support substantial populations of chaotic orbits in keeping with expectations that surfaced from the survey based on approximate solutions .",
    "we have explored orbital dynamics and phase mixing in thermal - equilibrium beams for which the potential is the superposition of an external potential quadratic in the coordinates and the self potential arising from space charge .",
    "the associated parameter space spans the full range of symmetries , i.e. , spherical , cylindrical , and triaxial , and the full range of density profiles , i.e. , gaussian ( corresponding to negligible space charge ) through uniform ( corresponding to maximal space charge ) . to reiterate , the main findings concerning chaos in these systems",

    "( [ eq : analyticlyapunov ] ) then yields the mixing rate @xmath9 .",
    "a comparison between theory and numerical experiments appears in fig .",
    "[ fig : mixcompare ] wherein the simulation results reflect statistics from initially localized clumps of 2000 particles that were started at zero velocity at various points in configuration space corresponding to various total particle energies @xmath24 .",
    "the figure presents a plot of the mixing rate @xmath9 versus @xmath176 in the case 5 configuration with @xmath177 , a slightly triaxial system .",
    "this configuration is `` not too far away '' from spherical symmetry , which means the zeroth approximation @xmath178 is correspondingly reasonable .",
    "it also means only a modest population ( @xmath179 for this parameter set ) of chaotic orbits is supported .",
    "the figure was derived within the framework of the zeroth approximation because therein the lyapunov exponents , i.e. , mixing rates , can be accurately computed from the simulations and the microcanonical averages required for the theory likewise can be easily and accurately evaluated .",
    "the numerical experiments span a range @xmath180 , corresponding to @xmath181 , i.e. , extending from within to well beyond the debye drop - off in the density profile .",
    "the agreement between theory and numerical experiments is remarkably close .",
    "one can see from the numerical experiments described herein that chaotic mixing takes place on an e - folding time scale comparable to a dynamical time ( an orbital period ) .",
    "this is very fast compared to , e.g. , collisional relaxation ; hence , one must account for this collisionless process when designing an accelerator for the production of high - peak - current , high - brightness beams .",
    "for example , particles comprising a beam out of equilibrium will , if globally chaotic , redistribute themselves globally and irreversibly on a dynamical time scale . because perturbations induced , e.g. , by transitions in the beamline will drive a beam away from equilibrium , chaotic mixing can be a dynamic of practical importance . consider the case of a te configuration : a small perturbation from image charges passing through an external irregularity in the beamline will distort the debye tail . if a substantial fraction of particles in the debye tail are chaotic , which is the case for a wide range of bunch geometries , a corresponding fraction of the orbits comprising the distortion will quickly mix throughout the volume of the configuration .",
    "the work done by the external perturbation in setting up the distortion will thereby appear in the form of a larger configuration - space volume . if the perturbation is strong enough so that mixing in momentum space associated with consequent time - dependence in the potential is also substantial , then some of the work done will also appear in the form of a larger momentum space .",
    "the net effect is a larger emittance .",
    "if there are many such perturbations along the beamline , the cumulative emittance growth may be troublesome .",
    "the present investigation and its associated implications concern only very specific , time - independent , single - species systems , i.e. , beams ( or nonneutral plasmas ) in thermal equilibrium .",
    "these are the most benign systems imaginable , yet we found even they can support chaotic orbits .",
    "any perturbation will create a nonequilibrium , time - dependent system that will subsequently evolve self - consistently .",
    "accordingly , the space - charge potential can be complicated , particularly if the perturbation is strong .",
    "the only sensible conjecture under such conditions is that the corresponding population of chaotic orbits will be larger , and in turn chaotic mixing will be more prevalent .",
    "exploratory numerical simulations of an equipartitioning system and of merging beamlets have supported this notion  @xcite .",
    "further exploration of time - dependent beams is warranted and will likely prove illuminating , particularly in regard to deciphering time scales for emittance growth , halo formation , etc .    by using only smooth potentials",
    "we have restricted our analysis to the six - dimensional phase space of a single particle .",
    "accordingly we have suppressed dissipative effects of collisions in particular , and force fluctuations in general .",
    "such effects can only enhance chaos , as has been demonstrated , e.g. , in numerical experiments concerning self - gravitating systems  @xcite . as the next step , we have constructed frozen @xmath62-body representations of the charge densities of the te configurations and with these representations are repeating the numerical experiments described herein .",
    "one of our objectives is to determine the minimum number of particles needed to reproduce the dynamics associated with smooth time - independent potentials .",
    "results will be described in a forthcoming paper  @xcite . in the future it will be of interest to do likewise for time - dependent systems and ultimately ascertain , e.g. , conditions under which the vlasov equation governing the six - dimensional phase space of a single particle can be applied with confidence .",
