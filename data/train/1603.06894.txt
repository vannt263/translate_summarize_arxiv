    "today s critical infrastructures are mostly managed by cyber - physical systems ( cps ) that consist of several actuators , sensors , and controllers .",
    "securing these systems against malicious attacks or communication failures is an important problem @xcite . in recent years , researchers have investigated various aspects of the problem of securing complex cps , e.g. , the networking security among cyber devices @xcite-@xcite and the early detection of faults / attacks @xcite-@xcite . from the controller s point of view",
    ", researchers have studied how we can securely estimate the state of a dynamical system from a set of noisy and maliciously corrupted sensor measurements . in particular ,",

    "_ propose a mathematical framework for cyber - physical systems , attacks , and monitors .",
    "they study the fundamental monitoring limitations for linear systems ( especially for power networks ) , and characterize the vulnerability of linear systems to cyber - physical attacks using graph theory . finally , to detect and to identify attacks , the authors propose centralized and decentralized filters , and validate their results via several examples .",
    "the main limitation of the study is that the proposed filters are computationally expensive , and are hard to implement in practice . in @xcite , fawzi _ et al . _",
    "focus on secure estimation and control of linear time - invariant systems , and assume that the set of attacked nodes does not change over time .",
    "the authors then formulate the system under attack as an estimation problem without any limiting assumption on attack signals , and propose a novel method for error estimation and correction .",
    "the main drawback of the study is that the set of attacked nodes is assumed to be fixed .",
    "@xcite extend the results in @xcite to scenarios in which the set of attacked nodes can change over time , and show that under a certain condition , the secure estimation problem with time - varying attacked nodes is equivalent to the classical error correction problem .",
    "the authors provide a novel method to guarantee accurate decoding , and then propose a secure estimation method which is a combination of the proposed secure estimator and the kalman filter ( kf ) .",
    "finally , they demonstrate the performance of their algorithm through numerous simulations .",
    "extensive work has been done on secure estimation for linear dynamical systems , here , we focus on the design of a secure state estimator for nonlinear systems .",
    "we study the secure estimation of the state of a nonlinear dynamical system from a set of corrupted measurements .",
    "in particular , we focus on two broad classes of nonlinear systems , and propose a technique which enables us to transform the nonlinear dynamics into a set of linear equations .",
    "we then apply the classical error correction method to the equivalent linear system , and provide guarantees on the achievable state estimation error against arbitrary corruptions . in this paper",
    ", we do not assume the sensor attacks or corruptions to follow any particular model .",
    "the only assumption concerning the corrupted sensors is about the number of sensors that are corrupted due to attacks or failures .",

    "as mentioned earlier , we focus on two broad classes of nonlinear systems in this paper . in order to illustrate how",
    "the proposed nonlinear state estimation approach can be applied to practical systems , we consider an interconnected power system comprising several synchronous generators , transmission lines , and energy storage units .",
    "we assume that all these physical devices are controlled via wide area control systems ( wacs ) as well as local controllers which use the synchrophasor technology to maintain the system s stability .",
    "wacs employ advanced data acquisition , communications , and control to enable increased efficiency and reliability of power delivery @xcite-@xcite .",
    "while wacs are the most promising technology to detect small signal instabilities in large power systems , their performance is highly dependent on the received data and on the underlying communication network .",
    "clearly , the greater dependence on communication systems increases opportunities for cyber - physical attacks and disturbances .",
    "extensive work has been done on monitoring and on autonomous feedback control for wacs @xcite , but this work has not studied how to identify cyber - physical attacks or communication failures , and how to perform secure state estimation for wacs .    in this paper , we focus on secure estimation for the wide area control of an interconnected power system , and assume that the system operator has installed several phasor measurement units ( pmu ) at different generator buses in the power network .",
    "these pmus are connected through a communication network which sends pmu measurements , including rotors speeds and generators phase angles , to different controllers in the system .",
    "we also assume that there are several communication channels between generators and the wacs , as well as channels between generators . these channels and pmus",
    "are not secured and are subject to cyber attacks and failures ( except the communication channels from the wacs to the generators ) .",
    "therefore , the wacs needs to perform secure state estimation to reconstruct the system s states before using the received data for computing wide area control signals , and to monitor the operation of local controllers installed in the system .",
    "we develop a secure state estimator for the wacs by using the proposed secure state estimation technique for nonlinear systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec_review ] , we review the classical error correction methods .",
    "we then formulate the nonlinear state estimation problem and propose a solution technique for the proposed problem in section [ sec_nonlinear_estimation ] .",

    "we focus on the new england power system comprising 10 generators and 39 buses .",
    "the values of the system parameters are taken from @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the power system is initially under equilibrium condition , and the rotor speeds of all 10 generators are at the nominal value , @xmath267 , of 60  hz .",
    "malicious attacks targeted at generator 1 are injected as follows :    * at every time step , the attacker randomly chooses to perform either a c - attack or an m - attack .",
    "denote the chosen attack type as @xmath268 $ ] . *",
    "a constant attack signal of @xmath269 is injected into the measurement of @xmath270 , i.e. , @xmath271}_{12 } = 90^\\circ$ ] . *",
    "9 additional measurements from @xmath272}_1 $ ] are chosen at random , and each of them is corrupted with a random gaussian signal .",
    "the left plot in figure [ fig : attack ] shows the true attack signals ( for clarity , only those measurements that are attacked at some point during the simulation are shown ) .",
    "initially , generator 1 has a phase angle of @xmath273 .",
    "the left plots in figure [ fig : se ] show that if no secure estimation - based protection is implemented , the phase angle of generator 1 deviates rapidly from its equilibrium value and reaches @xmath274 within 7.3 sec .",
    "when the phase angle difference between two generators exceeds @xmath269 , the generators can potentially loose synchrony and trip . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : attack ] , the proposed state estimation enables the wacs to reconstruct the rotor angles and rotational speeds of the generators accurately , and to prevent all possible failures .        .",
    "with secure estimation , the phase angle of generator 1 is maintained close to equilibrium , with a maximum deviation of only @xmath275 . ]",
    "we now consider the system s behavior with secure estimation - based protection .",
    "using the algorithm described in section [ sec_application1 ] , wacs estimates the attack signals and the generator phase angles .",
    "then , it sends the reconstructed measurements to all the generators , and each generator uses the reconstructed phase angle measurements to compute its local control input . during the simulation , the proposed estimation algorithm correctly estimates the type of attack at every time step (",
    "results are not shown due to space limitations ) and also recovers the attack signals accurately as shown in figure [ fig : attack ] .",
    "figure [ fig : se ] shows that by incorporating secure estimation in this way , even with a 2-step estimation delay , the phase angle of generator 1 is maintained within the range @xmath276 $ ] , i.e. , a maximum deviation of @xmath275 from its equilibrium value .",
    "in addition , generator 1 s rotor speed hardly deviates from the nominal frequency of 60 hz and is kept within @xmath277 $ ] .",
    "the phase angles of generators 4 to 10 are unaffected by the attack during the simulation period , and are not shown here for clarity .",
    "we propose a secure state estimator for two broad classes of nonlinear systems , and provide guarantees on the achievable state estimation error against arbitrary corruptions .",
    "more precisely , we analytically characterize the number of errors that can be perfectly corrected by a decoder .",
    "we then illustrate how the proposed estimator can be used in practical systems .",
    "in particular , by using the proposed estimator , we propose a secure state estimator for the wide area control of power systems under cyber - physical attacks and communication failures .",
