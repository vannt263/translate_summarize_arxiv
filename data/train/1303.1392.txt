    "self - seeding is a promising approach to significantly narrow the sase bandwidth and to produce nearly transform - limited pulses @xcite-@xcite .",
    "considerable effort has been invested in theoretical investigation and @xmath8 at the lcls leading to the implementation of a hard x - ray self - seeding ( hxrss ) setup that relies on a diamond monochromator in transmission geometry . following the successful demonstration of the hxrss setup at the lcls @xcite ,",
    "there is a need for an extension of the method in the soft x - ray range .",
    "in general , a self - seeding setup consists of two undulators separated by a photon monochromator and an electron bypass , normally a four - dipole chicane .",
    "the two undulators are resonant at the same radiation wavelength .",
    "the sase radiation generated by the first undulator passes through the narrow - band monochromator .",
    "a transform - limited pulse is created , which is used as a coherent seed in the second undulator . chromatic dispersion effect in the bypass chicane",
    "smears out the microbunching in the electron bunch produced by the sase lasing in the first undulator .",
    "the electrons and the monochromatized photon beam are recombined at the entrance of the second undulator , and radiation is amplified by the electron bunch until saturation is reached .",
    "the required seed power at the beginning of the second undulator must dominate over the shot noise power within the gain bandpass , which is order of a kw in the soft x - ray range .    for self - seeding in the soft x - ray range ,",
    "proposed monochromators usually consists of a grating @xcite , @xcite .",
    "recently , a very compact soft x - ray self - seeding ( sxrss ) scheme has appeared , based on grating monochromator @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the delay of the photons in the last sxrss version @xcite is about @xmath9 ps only .",
    "the proposed monochromator is composed of only three mirrors and a toroidal vls grating .",
    "the design adopts a constant , @xmath2 degree incidence - angle mode of operation , in order to suppress the influence of movement of the source point in the first sase undulator on the monochromator performance .    in this article",
    "we study the performance of the soft x - ray self - seeding scheme for the european xfel upgrade . in order to preserve the performance of the baseline undulator , we fit the magnetic chicane within the space of a single @xmath10 m undulator segment space at sase3 . in this way , the setup does not perturb the undulator focusing system .",
    "the magnetic chicane accomplishes three tasks by itself .",
    "it creates an offset for monochromator installation , it removes the electron microbunching produced in the upstream seed undulator , and it acts as an electron beam delay line for compensating the optical delay introduced by the monochromator .",
    "the monochromator design is compact enough to fit with this magnetic chicane design .",
    "the monochromator design adopted in this paper is an adaptation of the novel one by y. feng et al .",
    "@xcite , and is based on toroidal vls grating , and has many advantages .",
    "it consists of a few elements .",
    "in particular , it operates without entrance slit , and is , therefore , very compact .",
    "moreover , it can be simplified further .",
    "quite surprisingly , a monochromatic seed can be directly selected by the electron beam at the entrance of the second undulator .",
    "in other words , the electron beam plays , in this case , the role of an exit slit . by using a wave optics approach and fel simulations",
    "we show that the monochromator design without exit slits works in a satisfactory way .    with the radiation beam",
    "monochromatized down to the fourier transform limit , a variety of very different techniques leading to further improvement of the x - ray fel performance become feasible .",
    "in particular , the most promising way to extract more fel power than that at saturation is by tapering the magnetic field of the undulator @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a significant increase in power is achievable by starting the fel process from a monochromatic seed rather than from shot noise @xcite-@xcite . in this paper",
    "we propose a study of the soft x - ray self - seeding scheme for the european xfel , based on start - to - end simulations for an electron beam with 0.1 nc charge @xcite .",
    "simulations show that the fel power of the transform - limited soft x - ray pulses may be increased up to 1 tw by properly tapering the baseline ( sase3 ) undulator . in particular , it is possible to create a source capable of delivering fully - coherent , 10 fs ( fwhm ) soft x - ray pulses with @xmath11 photons per pulse in the water window .",
    "the availability of free undulator tunnels at the european xfel facility offers a unique opportunity to build a beamline optimized for coherent diffraction imaging of complex molecules like proteins and other biologically interesting structures . full exploitation of these techniques require 2 kev - 6 kev photon energy range and tw peak power pulses . however , higher photon energies are needed to reach anomalous edges of commonly used elements ( such as se ) for anomalous experimental phasing .",
    "potential users of the bio - imaging beamline also wish to investigate large biological structures in the soft x - ray photon energy range down to the water window .",
    "a conceptual design for the undulator system of such a bio - imaging beamline based on self - seeding schemes developed for the european xfel was suggested in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the bio - imaging beamline would be equipped with two different self - seeding setups , one providing monochromatization in the hard x - ray wavelength range , using diamond monochromators and one providing monochromatization in the soft x - ray range using a grating monochromator . in relation to this proposal , we note that the design for a soft x - ray self - seeding scheme discussed here can be implemented not only at the sase3 beamline but , as discussed in @xcite-@xcite , constitutes a suitable solution for the bio - imaging beamline in the soft x - ray range as well .",

    "the electron beam and the radiation pulse can be recombined .",

    "nm.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]                    the most promising way to increase the output power is via post - saturation tapering . tapering consists in a slow reduction of the field strength of the undulator in order to preserve the resonance wavelength , while the kinetic energy of the electrons decreases due to the fel process .",
    "the undulator taper could be simply implemented as a step taper from one undulator segment to the next , as shown in fig .",
    "the magnetic field tapering is provided by changing the undulator gap . a further increase in power",
    "is achievable by starting the fel process from the monochromatic seed , rather than from noise .",
    "the reason is the higher degree of coherence of the radiation in the seed case , thus involving , with tapering , a larger portion of the bunch in the energy - wavelength synchronism . using the tapering configuration in fig .",

    "historically , self - seeding methods were first proposed for the soft x - ray region , and were based on the use of grating monochromators @xcite , @xcite .",

    "the working principle for such monochromator was invented in @xcite , and resulted into a very compact self - seeding setup design fitting within a single undulator module . during the last three years",
    ", significant efforts were dedicated to both theoretical investigation and @xmath8 at the lcls , leading to the design of a compact self - seeding setup in the soft x - ray range , based on a grating monochromator .",
    "the evolution of the design can be reconstructed from @xcite-@xcite , striving at the same time for the needed resolution and compactness .",
    "the development of a self - seeding grating monochromator with the same compactness of a single - crystal monochromator is a challenging problem .",
    "however , the final design of the lcls soft x - ray self - seeding setup has many advantages .",

    "it does not include an entrance slit and during discussions , authors of @xcite pointed that this design might be operated even without exit slit by using the electron beam and the spatial dispersion at the second undulator entrance for spectral filtering purpose .",
    "in this article we present a technical study for a soft x - ray self - seeding setup at the european xfel .",
    "in particular we focus on design and performance of a very compact self - seeding grating monochromator , based on the lcls design , which has been adapted to the needs of the european xfel . usually , soft x - ray monochromators operate with incoherent sources and their design is based on the use of ray - tracing codes",
    ". however , xfel beams are almost completely transversely coherent , and in our case the optical system was studied using a wave optics method in combination with fel simulations to evaluate the performance of the self - seeding scheme .",
    "our wave optics analysis takes into account the actual fel beam wavefront , third order aberrations and surface errors from each optical elements .",
    "wave optics together with fel simulations are naturally applicable to the study the influence of finite slit size on the seeding efficiency .",
    "most results presented in @xcite were obtained in the framework of a gaussian beam model , in combination with ray - tracing for gaussian ray distribution .",
    "this is a very fruitful approach , allowing one for studying many features of the self - seeding monochromator by means of relatively simple tools . using our approach",
    ", we give a quantitative answer to the question of the accuracy of the gaussian beam model .",
    "it is also important to quantitatively analyze the filtering process without exit slit .",
    "wave optics in combination with fel simulations is the only method available to this aim .",
    "we conclude that the mode of operation without slit is superior to the conventional mode of operation , and a finite slit size would only lead to a reduction of the monochromator performance .",
    "we therefore propose an optimized design based on a toroidal vls grating and three mirrors , without exit slit .",
    "the monochromator covers the range between @xmath0 ev and @xmath1 ev , with a resolution never falling below @xmath23 , and introduces a photon delay of only @xmath9 ps .",
    "this allows the entire self - seeding setup to be fit into a single @xmath10 m - long undulator segment .",
    "the overall performance of the setup is studied with the help of fel simulations , which show that , in combination with post - saturation tapering , the sase3 baseline at the european xfel could deliver tw - class , nearly fourier - limited radiation pulses in the soft x - ray range .",
    "although we explicitly studied the a soft x - ray self - seeding setup for the sase3 undulator baseline at the european xfel , the same setup can be used without modifications also for the dedicated bio - imaging beamline , a concept that was proposed in @xcite-@xcite as a possible future upgrade of the european xfel . by exploiting third harmonic generation and fresh bunch technique together with the self - seeding mode of operation",
    "@xcite-@xcite one can extend the operation of the soft x - ray self - seeding setup to the range between @xmath2 kev up to @xmath24 kev , thus covering the sulfur k - edge without changes in the grating monochromator design @xcite .",
    "the x - ray beam will thus be delivered in ultrashort pulses with 1 tw peak power within the extended photon energy range between 0.3 kev up to 3 kev .",
    "for operation at higher photon energies x - ray self - seeding setups based on single crystal monochromators can be used .",
