    "while at the level of isospin violation itself the effects are obviously small , their influence in hsd may , in fact , be significant .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that isospin violation can induce mixing between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , described via @xmath47 the suggested phenomenological mixing angle is @xmath48 @xcite .",

    "let me now briefly compare with a @xmath58 approach @xcite : the quoted fit there results in a very low @xmath59 and for @xmath11 predicts @xmath60 both values are smaller than those presented here , which are in turn smaller than nave su(3 ) . to comprehend the difference between the predictions , note that the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite includes baryon - decuplet non - leptonic decay data , which dominate ; and the overall fit ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath61 ) is poor . however , applied to the hsd data alone , the results are similar to those reported here @xcite .",
    "these differences should be distinguishable by an experiment with good statistics , such as ktev @xcite .",
    "the preliminary ktev results are as follows @xcite : @xmath62 the errors are expected to be at least halved when the full data set is analysed .",
    "although not crucial to the @xmath4 and @xmath5 determination ( owing to low sensitivity to the breaking scheme ) , depending upon the final central values , the ktev data should have strong impact on the determination of @xmath6 .",
    "before concluding , let me call attention to an all too often overlooked point : although easier to analyse ( no extra corrections are necessary ) , the present data for angular correlations alone show _ no _ evidence of su(3 ) breaking .",
    "furthermore , compared to the full data set , they lack statistical power . _",
    "only full analyses can display the true picture _ @xcite . here",
    "i would comment that the observed consistency with unitarity ( _ i.e. _ , between @xmath8 and @xmath6 ) and the fact that there is no disagreement between _ complete _ analyses ( with the possible exception of @xcite ) suggest that the pdg @xcite might reconsider this sector as a contending source for estimating @xmath6 .",
    "indeed , unitarity appears better satisfied here than in the @xmath63 data .    a complete comprehension of su(3 )",
    "breaking is still wanting : witness the octet - decuplet discrepancy .",
    "moreover , the system is as yet not truly over - constrained ; in this context , i might also mention another decay ( already measured but not accurately ) for which large corrections are expected : namely , @xmath64 .",
    "there too , @xmath55 , permitting additional sensitive cross checks , especially in combination with the ktev results .    concluding then , i would stress that , while the data do manifest significant departures from su(3 ) , and there is even modest evidence for su(2 ) mixing , the mass - splitting driven schemes discussed here provide an adequate description .",
    "that said , there remains much to be understood , _",
    "e.g. _ , the long - standing question of second - class currents .",
    "thus , any new _ precise _ data are more than welcome and the contribution of the ktev collaboration will be invaluable .",
