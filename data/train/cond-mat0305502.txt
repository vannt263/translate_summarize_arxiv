    "the study of dilute systems has met a surge of renewed interest in the last years , following the experimental achievement of bose - einstein condensation in low density atomic gases confined in harmonic traps .",
    "systems are termed as dilute when the average interparticle distance , @xmath2 , is much larger than the range of the interaction , @xmath3 .",
    "the main parameter characterizing the interaction in the dilute regime is the @xmath4wave scattering length , @xmath5 , and the diluteness condition can be expressed in terms of the density , @xmath6 , as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the gas parameter .",
    "positive values of the scattering length correspond to an essentially repulsive interaction at short distances .",
    "in fact , for an infinite repulsive barrier , with no attractive part , @xmath5 is just given by the radius of the barrier itself .",
    "the hard sphere ( hs ) potential is largely adopted to study low density ( ld ) gases with positive scattering lengths because of its formal simplicity . however , other potentials , providing the same value of @xmath5 , are indistinguishable from the hs one at very low @xmath1 ( _ universality _ property ) .",
    "additional details of the interaction , giving raise to _ nonuniversal _",
    "effects , become relevant when the density ( and the gas parameter ) increases , allowing for discriminating among different potential shapes .",
    "typical ranges of @xmath1 where these differences begin to show up have been found@xcite to be @xmath9 .    in the density",
    "ranges attained in bose - einstein condensation experiments the local gas parameter may well exceed this value , exploiting the large variation of the scattering length in the vicinity of a fehsbach resonance@xcite . in order to quantitatively study this regime",
    "it is compulsory to check the reliability of the theories adopted in the analysis .",
    "a first , and much needed step in this direction , consists in understanding the properties of the underlying homogeneous gas of bosons at t=0 temperature .",
    "this is a time honored subject of many ",
    "body physics , addressed by a variety of methods , such as perturbative expansions , monte carlo ( mc ) type samplings , variational theories , and so on .",
    "expansions in @xmath1 may be suited to study dilute systems whose interaction can be safely described in terms of the @xmath4wave scattering length .",
    "they can be derived in the framework of standard perturbation theories , built on the basis constituted by the ground state of a non interacting bose fluid and its excited states , obtained by promoting particles from the zero momentum condensed state to the non  zero ones .",
    "infinite sums of ladder diagrams must be accomplished for strongly repulsive potentials .",
    "this procedure results in the well known lee and yang low density expansion for the energy per particle of a homogeneous gas of bosons@xcite , @xmath10 \\ , .",

    "alternatively , the interaction may be mimicked in the low density region by a delta  shaped pseudopotential@xcite , related to @xmath5 by @xmath11 which reproduces the value of the scattering length in the born approximation : @xmath12 this approach is followed in the bogoliubov theory@xcite , by introducing a model hamiltonian containing the pseudopotential .",
    "a canonical transformation of the bcs type allows for a partial diagonalization of the model hamiltonian , leading to a @xmath1expansion as in ( [ e_ly ] ) for the ground  state energy .",
    "nonuniversal effects have been studied in effective field theory in ref.@xcite , and found to depend , at the leading orders , on the effective range , @xmath13 , and on a three  body contact force parameter , @xmath14 , determined in this reference by comparison with the exact diffusion monte carlo results of ref.@xcite .",
    "the bosonic many  body schroedinger equation may be solved , for any potential , by monte carlo based methods , as the green s function monte carlo and the diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) ones .",
    "both approaches are exact , apart from statistical errors , and provide essential benchmarks to test the reliability of other theories , at least in those cases where the numerical accuracy allows for an unbiased analysis of the results .",
    "the variational approach is carried on within the correlated basis functions ( cbf ) perturbation theory , and represents its zeroth order .",
    "the correlated ground state wave function for @xmath15 interacting particles is obtained by acting with a many  body correlation operator on the non  interacting ground state wave function@xcite : @xmath16 the operator @xmath17 is meant to take into account the spatial correlations induced by the interaction on the free wave function @xmath18 ( for homogeneous bosons @xmath19 ) . for instance , in the hs case the correlation operator prevents the distance between any pair of particles from being smaller than the core radius , so that the wave function vanishes for these configurations .",
    "the theory is variational in the sense that @xmath20 is determined by minimizing the ground state energy .",
    "a correlated perturbation theory may be constructed by applying the correlation operator to the non  interacting excited states .",
    "the weakly interacting bose fluid has been recently studied within the variational method by means of the independent pair correlations ( ipc ) approach@xcite .",
    "the ipc wave function is written as @xmath21 where the two  body correlation functions , @xmath22 , always act on non  overlapping , independent pairs .",
    "the structure of a bose system described by the ipc wave function has been analyzed by means of an expansion in cluster diagrams .",
    "renormalized hypernetted chain ( hnc ) integral equations exactly sum all the diagrams and have been used to compute the energy , distribution function , momentum distribution and pairing function of the bulk boson system of soft spheres .",
    "the bogoliubov transformation itself is known to generate a wave function having the ipc structure@xcite , and a careful comparison between the variational and bogoliubov approaches has been performed in ref.@xcite , as well as with the outcomes of the diffusion monte carlo and low density theories , for soft sphere ( ss ) and gaussian like potentials .",
    "the ipc wave function fails for a hard  sphere fluid , since all pairs need to be simultaneously correlated .",

    "the jastrow ansatz is clearly richer than the ipc one , however it has the disvantage that the hnc equations can be only approximately solved , since a class of diagrams ( the @xmath25 diagrams ) is not summable in a closed way@xcite .",

    "the @xmath36 jastrow correlated wave function , obtained by the minimization of the energy per particle through the solution of the hnc euler equation @xcite , is used along this work .",
    "we compute the radial distribution function , @xmath37 , the static structure function , @xmath38 , and the momentum distribution , @xmath39 , for hs and ss models with identical scattering lengths , to ascertain the dependence on the potential form along the gas parameter .",
    "we work in the hnc/0 approximation , which amounts to disregard the contribution from the elementary diagrams and whose accuracy is tested by comparison with the exact dmc results .",
    "moreover , the jastrow theory is compared with the ld expansion and with the bogoliubov and ipc theories for the ss case .",
    "in addition , the ss potential is examined in the so called _ uniform limit _",

    "special emphasis is devoted to the analysis of several asymptotic behaviors .",
    "this is an interesting issue that can not be fully addressed with dmc methods , since the limited size of the simulation box strongly limits the possibility of studying effects related to long range structures .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : the hnc/0 and euler equations are shortly revisited in section ii ; the uniform limit for the ss potential and its connection with the random phase approximation ( rpa ) theory are discussed in section iii ; section iv present the results for the hs and ss models and summary and conclusions are given in section v.",
    "the exact wave function of a homogenous , interacting bose system can be written as the product of up to @xmath15body correlation factors@xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 for all @xmath45 . high density and strongly interacting systems , like atomic liquid @xmath46he ,",
