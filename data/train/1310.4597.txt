    "cuprate and organic superconductors show a pseudogap in their phase diagram over a substantial temperature and doping range .",
    "the pseudogap shows up as a suppression of the many - body density of states at the fermi energy in a number of experiments . for hole - doped cuprates",
    "this shows up as a dip in the photoemission spectrum in the @xmath10 direction , while there is a peak in the @xmath11 direction.@xcite the precise origin of the pseudogap is still a topic of debate .",
    "the understanding of the pseudogap is believed to be important for the electronic properties of cuprates , in particular , the mechanism of high - t@xmath12 superconductivity .",
    "both cuprates and the organic layered superconductors @xmath6-(bedt - ttf)@xmath7x are strongly correlated two - dimensional systems , which are mott@xcite insulators or close to mott insulators . for the cuprates",
    "a square lattice is used and for the organics an anisotropic triangular lattice which are described by nearest neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor hopping .",
    "undoped cuprates are antiferromagnetic insulators , driven by a large coulomb interaction @xmath0 . under doping",
    "the cuprates become metallic and the pseudogap is observed at small dopings in the underdoped range . on the other hand ,",
    "the organics are half - filled mott insulators at ambient pressure .",
    "these systems , which have weaker coulomb repulsion than the cuprates , become metallic under hydrostatic pressure or by substitution of the anions @xmath13 .",
    "thereby the lattice parameter in the planes and the geometrical frustration can be varied .",
    "hence , the cuprates are benchmark systems to analyze the doping - driven mott transition whereas the organics are ideal examples of the coulomb - driven mott transition .    early observation of the pseudogap in cuprates were made in , e.g. , spin - lattice relaxation times,@xcite knight shifts,@xcite resistivity,@xcite , photoemission spectra,@xcite raman scattering,@xcite tunneling@xcite and scanning tunneling microscopy data.@xcite for a review see timusk and statt.@xcite evidence of a pseudogap in metallic @xmath6-(bedt - ttf)@xmath7x salts close to an antiferromagnetic mott insulator comes from the @xmath14-dependence of magnetic susceptibility , @xmath15 , nmr relaxation rate , @xmath16 and knight shift , @xmath17 experiments.@xcite a significant decrease in @xmath15 is observed below 50 k becoming steeper as the mott transition is approached.@xcite for instance , @xmath18c nmr @xmath16 and @xmath17 experiments @xcite on @xmath6-(et)@xmath7cu[n(cn)@xmath7]br display a suppression also below about 50 k becoming more pronounced in deuterated samples which are effectively closer to the mott transition . under hydrostatic pressures of 4 kbar ,",
    "@xmath16 becomes nearly constant reestablishing conventional metallic behavior and no pseudogap .",
    "metallic states obtained from the spin liquid@xcite mott insulator,@xmath6-(et)@xmath7cu@xmath7(cn)@xmath20 under pressures@xcite above 0.4 gpa do not show signs of a pseudogap in @xmath16 experiments .    despite their similarities @xcite",
    "there are also differences between cuprates and organics , doping being the crucial tuning parameter for cuprates and frustration and lattice parameter for the organics .",
    "nevertheless , the pseudogap phenomenon appears similar in both types of systems , and closely related models are used to describe them .",
    "we will therefore address both classes of systems here .",
    "there have been a large number of theories addressing the pseudogap in cuprates .",

    "it has been argued that the pseudogap and superconductivity phases compete.@xcite    in the context of the @xmath6-(bedt - ttf)@xmath7x organics , there have been path integral renormalization group ( pirg),@xcite variational cluster perturbation theory , @xcite cluster dmft,@xcite finite-@xmath14 lanczos diagonalization @xcite and cluster perturbation theory calculations@xcite on the hubbard model on an anisotropic triangular lattice .",
    "dmft @xcite has been very successful in describing the crossover from a fermi liquid to a bad metal at low temperature , @xmath24 , observed in resistivity,@xcite optical conductivity,@xcite ultrasonic attenuation@xcite and thermopower@xcite of @xmath6-(bedt - ttf)@xmath7x .",
    "a pseudogap was found,@xcite from cdmft on four site clusters and assigned to antiferromagnetic fluctuations.@xcite the relevance of short range spin fluctuations to the pseudogap phase in organics has been discussed.@xcite cluster dmft calculations show a reentrant behavior@xcite for the metal - insulator transition in agreement with experiment.@xcite several@xcite of the embedded cluster calculations have used clusters with four or fewer sites , which complicates the discussion of the large differences between @xmath10 and @xmath25 , since the latter @xmath23-vector is not present for most of these small clusters and interpolation procedures have been used .    the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) treats a cluster of @xmath26 atoms embedded in a self - consistent bath . in much of the discussions , we describe the cluster in terms of the @xmath26 one - particle levels with different @xmath27 vectors , where each state couples to its own bath .",
    "we perform numerical experiments to identify important factors for the pseudogap .",
    "we show that for , e.g. , a @xmath28 cluster , a pseudogap is formed also for a non self - consistent ( metallic ) bath . in contrast a non self - consistent dmft ( @xmath29 )",
    "calculation always gives a kondo peak for a metallic bath .",
    "this shows the importance of the internal structure of the cluster . in a second numerical experiment , we exchange the baths for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 cluster levels with the @xmath30 levels",
    "the pseudogap then appears at @xmath25 instead of @xmath3 .",
    "this shows that the bath also plays a crucial role .",
    "the essential aspect is that the coupling to the @xmath31 and @xmath4 levels is much weaker than the coupling to the @xmath30 levels .",
    "the coupling to the bath of a @xmath27-point is related to the second moment of the one - particle eigenvalue in a patch around the @xmath27-point .",
    "this is much larger for the @xmath32 levels than for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 levels .",
    "guided by a small ( @xmath33 ) cluster , giving a pseudogap , we construct a very simple four - level model , with two cluster levels each coupling to one bath level .",
    "the two cluster levels represent the @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xmath27-levels on the cluster . for a small coulomb interaction @xmath0 , the cluster levels form",
    "kondo - like states with the bath .",
    "as @xmath0 is increased , a localized state is formed on the cluster .",
    "if this localized state is nondegenerate , the kondo - like states are destroyed and a pseudogap is formed .",
    "if the localized cluster state instead is a triplet , a new kondo state is formed with the bath as @xmath0 is increased and there is no pseudogap for moderate values of @xmath0 .",
    "we analyze the formation of a pseudogap or a kondo - like peak in terms of interference effects . by comparing correlation functions , we find that a @xmath28 dca calculation behaves in a similar way as the case with a localized nondegenerate cluster state .",
    "we emphasize the importance of the internal structure of the cluster .",
    "this leads to a competition between kondo - like effects and the formation of a localized state on the cluster .",
    "let us consider a @xmath28 calculation with both @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath30 cluster levels .",
    "for a small value of @xmath0 , electrons in these levels form kondo - like states with their baths .",
    "electrons in the different cluster levels are only moderately correlated . as @xmath0 is increased , the energy gain from the kondo - like coupling is reduced and it becomes favorable to localize electrons in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 cluster levels .",
    "this process , however , differs in essential ways from two independent mott transitions in the two channels , as described in the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) .",
    "electrons in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 levels become strongly correlated , in a similar way as for an isolated four site cluster .",
    "the corresponding energy gain is important for driving the transition .",
    "the coupling to the bath is much larger for the @xmath32 than for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 levels .",
    "the @xmath32 electrons therefore remain in kondo - like states up to larger values of @xmath0 . as @xmath0",
    "is increased further , it becomes favorable to also localize the @xmath32 electrons .",
    "all the electrons in the different cluster levels then become strongly correlated , leading to a large contribution to the energy .",
    "we also show why the pseudogap is lost for a frustrated electron - doped cuprate .",
    "very similar work has been done by ferrero _ et al._,@xcite de leo _ et al._,@xcite and capone _ et al._,@xcite who considered two- and three - orbital anderson models and a four - impurity model .",
    "this work emphasized the interorbital interaction and the cross over from a kondo screened state to an unscreened state .",
