    "the study of different algebraic structures using graph theory becomes an exciting research topic in the last few decades , leading to many fascinating results and questions .",
    "given an algebraic structure @xmath10 , there are different formulations to associate a directed or undirected graph to @xmath10 , and we can study the algebraic properties of @xmath10 in terms of properties of associated graphs .    directed power graphs associated to semigroups were introduced by kelarev and quinn @xcite .",
    "if @xmath10 is a semigroup , then the directed power graph @xmath11 of @xmath10 is a directed graph with @xmath10 as the set of all vertices and for any two distinct vertices @xmath12 and @xmath13 of @xmath10 , there is an arc from @xmath12 to @xmath13 if @xmath14 for some positive integer @xmath15 .",
    "then chakrabarty , ghosh and sen @xcite defined the undirected power graph @xmath16 of a semigroup @xmath10 as the underlying undirected graph of @xmath11 .",
    "thus two distinct elements @xmath12 and @xmath13 of @xmath10 are edge connected in @xmath16 if @xmath17 or @xmath18 for some positive integer @xmath15 .",
    "they proved that for a finite group @xmath3 , the undirected power graph @xmath19 is complete if and only if @xmath3 is a cyclic group of order @xmath20 or @xmath21 for some prime @xmath22 and positive integer @xmath15 . in @xcite",
    ", cameron showed that for two finite commutative groups @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 implies that @xmath26 .",
    "they also observed that two finite groups with isomorphic undirected power graphs have the same number of elements of each order .",
    "singh and manilal @xcite introduced strong power graph as a generalization of the undirected power graph of a finite group .",
    "let @xmath3 be a group of @xmath27 elements .",
    "the strong power graph @xmath9 of @xmath3 is a simple undirected graph whose vertices consists of the elements of @xmath3 and two distinct vertices @xmath4 and @xmath5 are adjacent in @xmath9 if @xmath28=@xmath29 for some positive integers @xmath30 .",
    "thus a finite group @xmath3 is noncyclic if and only if @xmath9 of is complete .",
    "also @xmath9 is connected if and only if @xmath27 is composite .    here",
    "we give several graph theoretic and spectral characterizations of the strong power graph of a finite group .",
    "the strong power graph @xmath9 is a cayley graph of some group if and only if @xmath3 is noncyclic .",
    "we give a complete list of the finite groups @xmath3 such that @xmath9 is a line graph .",
    "such characterizations of the strong power graphs are given in section 2 . in section 3 , the algebraic connectivity and the chromatic number of @xmath9",
    "have been found .    for any graph @xmath31 ,",
    "let @xmath32 be the adjacency matrix and @xmath33 be the diagonal of vertex degrees .",
    "then the laplacian matrix of @xmath31 is defined as @xmath34=@xmath35 .",
    "clearly @xmath34 is a real symmetric matrix and it is well known that @xmath36 is a positive semidefinite matrix with @xmath37 as the smallest eigen value .",
    "thus we can assume that the laplacian eigen values are @xmath38 . among all laplacian eigen values of a graph ,",
    "one of the most popular is the second smallest , called by fiedler @xcite , the algebraic connectivity of a graph .",
    "it is a good parameter to measure , how well a graph is connected .",
    "for example , a graph is connected if and only if its algebraic connectivity is non - zero . according to mohar @xcite the laplacian eigen values are more intuitive and much more important than the eigen values of the adjacency matrix .",
    "we give a complete characterization of the laplacian spectrum of strong power graph of any finite group in section 4 .    in section 5 , we have derived an explicit formula for the permanent of the laplacian matrix of strong power graphs of any finite group .",
    "let @xmath39 be a square matrix of order @xmath27 , then the permanent of @xmath40 is denoted by per@xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the set of all permutations of @xmath43 .",
    "the permanent function was introduced by binet and independently by cauchy in 1812 .",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite for more on permanent .",
    "in this section we characterize the groups @xmath3 such that the strong power graph @xmath9 is a line graph and cayley graph .",
    "the line graph @xmath34 of a graph @xmath31 is constructed by taking the edge of @xmath31 as vertices of @xmath34 , and joining two vertices in @xmath34 whenever the corresponding edges in @xmath31 have a common vertex . a graph @xmath31 is called a line graph if it is a line graph of some graph .",
    "the induced subgraph @xmath44 of a graph @xmath31 is a subgraph whose vertex set @xmath45 and all the edges whose endpoints are contained in @xmath46 .",
    "the graph obtained by taking the union of graphs @xmath31 and @xmath47 with disjoint vertex set is the disjoined union or sum , denoted by @xmath48 .",
    "the following result is a fundamental characterization of the simple line graphs .",
    "proof of this result can be found in @xcite .",
    "a simple graph @xmath3 is the line graph of some simple graph if and only if @xmath3 does not have any of the nine graphs below as an induced subgraph .        for any positive integer @xmath27",
    ", @xmath49 denotes the group of all integers modulo @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath50 .",
    "thus @xmath51 for every prime @xmath22",
    ". then we have @xmath52 @xmath53 or a prime .    if @xmath54 is a line graph then @xmath55 or a prime .",
    "if possible , on the contrary , suppose that @xmath56 and a prime .",
    "then it follows that @xmath57 which implies that @xmath58 , and hence @xmath49 has at least three non - generators say , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in this case",
    "the following graph is an induced subgraph of @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , by lemma 2.1 , @xmath54 can not be a line graph .",
    "now we are ready to characterize all groups @xmath3 such that @xmath9 is a line graph .",
    "let @xmath3 be a finite group of order @xmath27 .    1 .   if @xmath3 is non - cyclic , then @xmath9 is a line graph of @xmath61 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath3 is cyclic , then @xmath9 is line graph if and only if @xmath55 or a prime .",
    "if @xmath3 is non - cyclic then @xmath9 is a complete graph with @xmath27 vertices , and hence @xmath62 .",
    "let @xmath3 be a cyclic group .",
    "since strong power graphs of two isomorphic groups are isomorphic , so it is sufficient to prove the result for @xmath63 .",
    "first suppose that @xmath55 or a prime .",
    "we have @xmath64 is the line graph of the graph        and @xmath65 is the line graph of the graph        if @xmath66 , a prime number then @xmath67 is the line graph of @xmath68 .",
    "converse , follows from the lemma 2.2 .",
    "the notion of caley graph was first introduced by sir arthur cayley ( 1878 ) to produce a large class of natural example of vertex transitive graphs .",
    "let @xmath3 be a finite group of order @xmath27 and @xmath10 be a subset of @xmath3 not containing @xmath69 , the identity of @xmath3 satisfying @xmath70 .",
    "then the cayley graph of @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath71 is the graph whose vertex set is @xmath3 and two distinct vertices @xmath72 are edge connected if @xmath73 .",
    "let @xmath3 be a group of order @xmath27 .",
    "then @xmath9 is cayley graph of some group @xmath23 if and only if @xmath3 is noncyclic .",
    "let @xmath3 is a noncyclic group of order @xmath27 .",
    "then @xmath9 is a complete graph .",
    "consider @xmath74 and @xmath75 , then clearly @xmath9 is cayley graph of @xmath74 .",
    "if @xmath3 is a cyclic group of order @xmath27 , then @xmath9 is not regular . but",
    "every cayley graph is regular .",
    "hence @xmath9 is not a cayley graph of any group .",
    "in this section we have discussed about vertex connectivity and chromatic number of the strong power graph @xmath9 of any finite group g.    the * vertex connectivity or connectivity * of a graph @xmath76 is the minimum number of vertices in a vertex set @xmath10 such that @xmath31 @xmath77 @xmath10 is disconnected or has only vertex .",
    "it is denoted by @xmath78.thus if @xmath31 is a complete graph with @xmath27 vertices then @xmath79=@xmath80 , and if @xmath31 is a disconnected graph then @xmath79=@xmath37 .",
    "the strong power graph @xmath9 of every finite noncyclic group @xmath3 is complete .",
    "thus we have :    for any non cyclic finite group g of order n the vertex connectivity @xmath81 is n-1 .",
    "let g be a cyclic group of order @xmath82 @xmath831 .    *",
    "if n is a prime number then @xmath81= @xmath37 . * if n is a composite number then @xmath84 = @xmath85 .",
    "every non identity element of the group @xmath3is of order @xmath27,and no element of @xmath3 is adjacent with the identity element @xmath69 of the group @xmath3.thus @xmath9 is a disconnected graph with two components @xmath86 and @xmath3 @xmath77 @xmath86 , which implies that @xmath81=@xmath37 .",
    "if @xmath27 is composite then @xmath85 elements of the finite cyclic group @xmath3 are non identity and non generators .",
    "each of these non identity non generators is adjacent to every other vertex , which implies that to make the graph @xmath9 disconnected we have to remove at least these @xmath85 non identity non generators .",
    "thus @xmath81 @xmath87 @xmath85 . since each generator is adjacent to every non identity element , so the removal of these @xmath85 non identity non generators makes the remaining graph disconnected with two components , one containing @xmath69 only and other containing all the generators .",
    "thus @xmath81=@xmath85 .",
    "the * chromatic number * of a graph @xmath31 is the minimum number of colours required to colour the vertices so that adjacent vertices get distinct colours .",
    "let g be a cyclic group of order n , then the chromatic number @xmath88 of the strong power graph @xmath9 is n-1 .",
    "the subgraph @xmath9 @xmath77 @xmath69 is complete . since the chromatic number of a complete graph with @xmath80 vertices is @xmath80 , so the chromatic number @xmath88 @xmath89 .",
    "since the generators of the cyclic group @xmath3 are not adjacent with the identity @xmath69 of @xmath3 , either of of colours of the generators can be given to @xmath69 and hence @xmath88 @xmath90 .",
    "thus @xmath88 = @xmath80 .",
    "let g be a non - cyclic group of order n , then the chromatic number of the strong power graph @xmath9 is n.    since the strong power graph @xmath9 of the cyclic group @xmath3 is complete , hence the result follows .",
    "for each positive integer @xmath91 let @xmath92@xmath93 are non generators of @xmath49 then @xmath94 = @xmath95 , where m=@xmath85 .    the laplacian matrix @xmath96 is the n times n matrix whose rows and columns are indexed in order by the non generators @xmath92@xmath93 and the generators of @xmath49 and @xmath97 is in last position .",
    "then @xmath98 + each row and column sum of the above matrix is zero .",
    "then the characteristic polynomial of @xmath96 is @xmath99=    @xmath100    multiplying the first row of @xmath99 by @xmath101 and applying the row operation @xmath102=@xmath103 .",
    "then the above determinant becomes @xmath104 again multiplying the first row of @xmath105 by @xmath106 and applying the row operation @xmath102=@xmath107 we get @xmath108 and so @xmath109 continuing in this way we get @xmath110 where    @xmath111= @xmath112    @xmath113 , @xmath114 and order of the determinant is @xmath115 .",
    "now expanding @xmath116 with respect to last row we get    @xmath117    thus @xmath118 .",
    "let g is a cyclic group of order n , then @xmath3 is isomorphic to @xmath49 ; and the strong power graphs @xmath9 and @xmath54 of @xmath3 and @xmath49 respectively are isomorphic .",
    "hence the graphs @xmath9 and @xmath54 have the same laplacian spectrum .",
    "so by theorem @xmath119 we have :    if @xmath3 is a cyclic group of order @xmath27,then the laplacian spectrum of @xmath9 is @xmath120    for any non cyclic group @xmath3 , the strong power graph @xmath9 is complete @xcite .",
    "so their laplacian spectrum is given by :    let @xmath3 be a noncyclic group of order @xmath27 , then the laplacian spectrum of @xmath9 is @xmath121    the algebraic connectivity of a graph @xmath31 , denoted by @xmath122 , is the second smallest laplcian eigen value of @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "now , the algebraic connectivity has received special attention due to its huge applications on connectivity problems , isoperimetric numbers , genus , combinatorial optimizations and many other problems .",
    "thus by theorem @xmath119 and proposition @xmath123 we have :    let @xmath3 be a group of order @xmath27 .    1 .",
    "if @xmath3 is a cyclic group then @xmath124 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath3 is a noncyclic group then @xmath125 .",
    "another important application of laplacian spectrum is on the number of spanning trees of a graph .",
    "a spanning tree @xmath44 of a graph @xmath31 is a subgraph which is a tree having same vertex set is same as @xmath31 .",
    "if @xmath126 @xmath87@xmath127@xmath87@xmath128@xmath87@xmath129@xmath87@xmath130=@xmath37 are the laplacian eigenvalues of a graph @xmath31 of @xmath27-vertices , then the number of spanning trees of @xmath31 is denoted by @xmath131 is given by @xmath132 [ theorem 4.11 ; @xcite ] .",
    "thus from the proposition @xmath133 and proposition @xmath123 we have :    let @xmath3 be a group of order @xmath27 .    1 .",
    "if @xmath3 is a cyclic group then @xmath134 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath3 is a noncyclic group then @xmath135 .",
    "the graph energy is defined in terms of the spectrum of the adjacency matrix .",
    "depending on the well - developed spectral theory of the laplacian matrix , recently gutman et .",
    "al @xcite have defined the laplacian energy of a graph @xmath31 with @xmath27 vertices and @xmath15 edges as : @xmath136 , where @xmath126 @xmath87@xmath127@xmath87@xmath128@xmath87@xmath129@xmath87@xmath130=@xmath37 are the laplacian eigen values of the graph @xmath31 .",
    "this definition has been adjusted so that the laplcian energy becomes equal to the energy for any regular graph .",
    "for various properties of laplacian energy we refer @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . from proposition",
    "@xmath133 and proposition @xmath123 we have    let @xmath3 be a finite group of order @xmath27 .    1 .",
    "if @xmath3 is cyclic then @xmath137 .",
    "if @xmath3 is noncyclic then @xmath138 .",
    "let us recall the definition of permanent of a square matrix . for any square matrix @xmath139 of order @xmath27 ,",
    "the permanent of a is denoted by per(a ) and per(a ) = @xmath140 .",
    "it is quite difficult to determine the permanent of a square matrix . in this section",
    "we have determined the permanent of the laplacian matrix of strong power graph of any finite group explicitly .",
    "our method is based on the following observation .",
    "let a = @xmath141 be a matrix of order @xmath27 , then per(a ) is equal to the coefficient of @xmath142 in the expression @xmath143 . throughout the rest of this section",
    "we make the following convention : for any @xmath27-functions @xmath144 and for any @xmath27 variables @xmath145 , the coefficient of @xmath146 in a polynomial @xmath147 will be denoted by @xmath148 . here",
    "we first find the permanent of adjacency matrix of any graph with @xmath149 vertices such that @xmath150 vertices form a clique and the rest vertex is adjacent with @xmath27 vertices .",
    "we have the following lemma ,          @xmath157 @xmath158(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{m+i}).\\\\ & = n c_{x_1x_2 \\cdots x_{m+n}}(x_{m+1}\\prod_{i=1}^{m}(x - x_i)[\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x - x_{m+1})(x - x_{m+2})\\cdots\\widehat{(x - x_{m+i } ) } \\cdots(x - x_{m+n})])\\\\ & = n c_{x_1x_2 \\cdots x_m x_{m+2 } \\cdots x_{m+n}}(\\prod_{i=1}^{m}(x - x_i)[\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x - x_{m+1})(x - x_{m+2})\\cdots\\widehat{(x - x_{m+i } ) } \\cdots(x - x_{m+n})])\\\\ & = n[c_{x_1x_2 \\cdots x_m x_{m+2 } \\cdots x_{m+n}}((x - x_1)\\cdots ( x - x_m)(x - x_{m+2})\\cdots ( x - x_{m+n}))+ \\\\ & \\hspace{1.5 cm } c_{x_1x_2 \\cdots x_m x_{m+2 } \\cdots x_{m+n}}((x - x_1)\\cdots ( x - x_m)(x - x_{m+1})(x - x_{m+3})\\cdots ( x - x_{m+n}))+\\cdots \\\\",

    "let @xmath3 be a cyclic group of order @xmath27 .",
    "then @xmath3 has @xmath167 generators none of which is adjacent to the identity element @xmath69 of @xmath3 .",
