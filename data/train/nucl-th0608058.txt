    "jet quenching is one of the most promising tools to extract the initial parton density produced in high energy heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "this is related to the final state energy loss of the leading partons causing depopulation of hadrons  @xcite at high transverse momentum ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the suppressions of high @xmath1 hadrons and unbalanced back - to - back azimuthal correlations of the dijet events in au+au collisions measured at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) provide experimental evidence in support of the quenching .",
    "the observed nuclear suppression of light hadrons ( @xmath2 ) in @xmath3 collisions at @xmath4 a gev at rhic was reproduced by radiative loss only assuming that the contributions from collisional loss is negligible . however , the non - photonic single electron spectrum from heavy meson decays measured by phenix collaboration  @xcite put this assumption in question .",
    "no realistic parameter set can explain this data using the radiative energy loss based jet tomography model which either requires violation of bulk entropy bounds or non - perturbatively large @xmath5 of the theory @xcite , or equivalently one requires excessive transport co - efficient @xmath6 gev@xmath7/fm @xcite .",
    "in this light , we , in the present work would like to address if the omission of collisional loss at rhic is justified or not .",
    "we argue that , whether the collisional or radiative loss is the main mechanism of energy dissipation , is a @xmath1 dependent question .",
    "it also depends on the energies of the colliding system and expected to be different for rhic and large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "in contrast to the previous works , we calculate nuclear suppression factor for pions at rhic energy considering only the collision energy loss .    the partonic energy loss due to collisional processes was revisited in  @xcite and its importance was demonstrated in the context of rhic in@xcite .",
    "it is shown in ref.@xcite that there exists an energy range where collisional loss is as important as or even greater than its radiative counter part , hence can not be neglected in any realistic model of jet quenching .",
    "recently this is also noted in ref.@xcite .",
    "we use fokker planck ( fp ) equation to dynamically evolve parton spectra .",
    "fp equation can be derived from boltzmann equation if one of the partner of the binary collisions is in thermal equilibrium and the collisions are dominated by the small angle scattering involving soft momentum exchange @xcite . for a longitudinally expanding plasma ,",
    "fp equation reads : ( -)f(*p*,t ) = [ p_if(*p*,t ) ] + + [ b_(*p*)f(*p*,t ) ] + + [ b_f(*p*,t ) ] [ fpexp ] where the second term on the left hand side arises due to expansion  @xcite .",
    "bjorken hydrodynamical model  @xcite has been used here for space time evolution . in eq .",
    "( [ fpexp ] ) , @xmath8 represents the non - equilibrium distribution of the partons under study , @xmath9 , denotes drag coefficient , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , represent diffusion constants along parallel and perpendicular directions of the propagating partons .    in our calculations we include some of the important features which were ignored in previous work  @xcite in the context of jet quenching .",
    "these are : ( i ) the term corresponding to the longitudinal expansion is included , ( ii ) the momentum evolution of parton distributions both along longitudinal and transverse direction is considered and ( iii ) the mechanism of hadronization is introduced .",
    "the transport coefficients , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 appeared in eq .",
    "(  [ fpexp ] ) have been calculated in ref .",
    "the fp equation has been solved for the initial parton distributions parametrized as  @xcite : f(p_t , p_z , t = t_i)|_y=0= , where @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "since asymptotically the multiplicity of any hadron species produced by a gluon jet is @xmath17 times that of quark  @xcite , the normalization constant @xmath18 for gluons is chosen accordingly . solving the fp equation with the boundary conditions , @xmath19 for @xmath20",
    ", we evaluate the nuclear suppression factor , @xmath0 defined as , r_aa(p_t ) =     gev / a.,title=\"fig : \" ] +     gev / a.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    where @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the parton distributions at proper time @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively . here",
    "@xmath23 is the initial time and @xmath24 is the time when the system cools down to the transition temperature @xmath25 ( = 190 mev ) .",
    "we have taken @xmath26 and the initial temperature @xmath27 mev .",
    "the result of our calculations for neutral pion is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] which describes the phenix data@xcite for @xmath3 at @xmath28 gev reasonably well . to stress our point",
    "further we also analyse the excitation function of the nuclear suppression factor .",
    "this has recently been studied in  @xcite attributing the suppression mechanism to radiative loss .",
    "as at lower @xmath29 , collisional loss wins over its radiative counter part , we reanalyze the excitation function with the former and reproduce the data well  @xcite .    to pin down the relative importance of @xmath30 and @xmath31 processes , we determine the average energy of the parton which contribute to the measured @xmath1 window of the hadrons .",
    "the average fractional momentum , @xmath32 of the fragmenting partons carried by the pion is calculated using relevant parton distribution and fragmentation functions , i.e. @xmath33 . for the parton distributions , we use cteq  @xcite including shadowing _ via _",
    "eks98 parametrization@xcite , while for the fragmentation function kkp parametrization is used @xcite .",
    "the average energy of the parton , @xmath34 is obtained by using the relation @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "it might be recalled that at rhic energies the nuclear modification factor @xmath37 has been measured in the pion transverse momenta range @xmath38 gev . assuming that these pions are originated from the fragmenting partons it is clear that the maximum average parton energy required is about 26 gev here .",
    "we might compare this value with the determined @xmath39 is defined to be the energy below which elastic loss dominates  @xcite .",
    "] given in ref .",
    "@xcite and note that at these energies collisional loss can not be neglected . for lower beam energy , 62.4 ( 130 ) a gev the value of maximum average parton energy required to produce a 13 gev pion is 16 ( 22 ) gev , where the collisional loss will definitely be more important .",
    "in conclusion , our investigations clearly suggest that in the measured @xmath1 range of light hadrons at rhic collisional , rather than the radiative , is the dominant mechanism of jet quenching .",
    "inclusion of three body elastic channels might even increase @xmath39 making our point stronger .",
