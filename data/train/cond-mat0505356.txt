    "magnetic nanowires still attracted much attention despite a long history of the study of elongated magnetic nanoparticles @xcite . besides some potential technological applications such as high density magnetic information storage",
    ", magnetic nanowires also provide a unique arena for testing theoretical models of magnetization reversal .",
    "recent work on magnetization reversal @xcite and domain wall motion @xcite in magnetic nanowires has provided in - depth understanding of magnetism on the nanometer scale and even atomic scales . in a magnetic nanowire ,",
    "the competition between the magnetostatic energy and magnetic exchange interaction gives rise to a characteristic length , the coherence diameter , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the magnetic exchange length , @xmath2 the exchange constant and @xmath3 the saturation magnetization @xcite .",
    "for fe , co , and ni , @xmath4 is about 11 , 15 and 25 nm , respectively @xcite . for an ideal nanowire with diameter @xmath5 ,",
    "micromagnetic theory predicts a coherent rotation of the entire magnetic volume due to the dominance of exchange interactions , while incoherent reversal modes such as curling are favored for nanowires with @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "a large body of experimental results on magnetic nanowires have been analyzed in terms of these fundamental reversal modes .",
    "most of the measurements , however , were carried out on ensembles of magnetic nanowires , in which data analysis is complicated by the distribution of size , shape , and microstructure of the nanowires , as well as the dipolar interaction between the nanowires . in addition , some important properties of individual particles such as the stochastic nature of magnetization reversal are averaged out .",
    "measurements on single magnetic nanowires have only been reported in a few cases .",
    "for example , electrodeposited ni or co nanowires with diameters between 30 nm and 90 nm were studied with micro - squid magnetometers @xcite and subsequently by utilizing the anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) effect @xcite .",
    "experimental data from these measurements have been fitted to the curling mode , but difficulty arises due to the fact that the anisotropy energy from magnetocrystalline and/or other effects are comparable to the shape anisotropy @xcite .",
    "hence , the study of individual nanowires with one dominant anisotropy could provide further insight into the fundamental magnetization reversal process in such magnetic nanostructures .",
    "the fe nanowires are one of the ideal systems because their shape anisotropy is at least one order of magnitude larger than the magnetocrystalline and strain anisotropies @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we report the first detailed study of _ individual _ cylinder - shaped fe nanoparticles with diameters close to the coherence diameter . measurements of a single fe nanocylinder with @xmath7 nm reveals the incoherent and localized nature of the magnetization reversal although the particle has a single - domain static state .",
    "we also present the results on an elongated fe nanoparticle with more structural imperfections , as the first step toward studying more complex magnetic dynamics in nanowires with diameters on the 10 nm scale .",
    "cylinder - shaped fe nanoparticles were fabricated with a scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) assisted chemical vapor deposition technique , in which a precursor , fe(co)@xmath8 , was decomposed by applying a high bias voltage to the stm tip @xcite .",
    "growth was controlled by the stm feedback electronics operated in constant tunneling current mode .",
    "the fabricated fe nanoparticles have a polycrystalline bcc iron core surrounded by an amorphous carbon coating @xcite , which effectively prevents the sample from oxidation @xcite .",
    "the diameter of the iron core can be varied from a few nm to 20 nm by varying the growth rate , which can be controlled by the precursor pressure @xcite .",
    "the height of the fe particles can be precisely controlled by withdrawing the piezoelectric scanning tube after it reaches a predetermined setpoint and can be varied from tens of nanometers to a few microns @xcite . in order to measure a single fe nanoparticle",
    ", we grew a small number of fe nanoparticles with very large spacing onto a submicron hall magnetometer fabricated from a gaas / algasas heterostructure .",
    "the heterostructure is consisted of a 1@xmath9 m undoped gaas layer , a 30 nm al@xmath10ga@xmath11as spacer , a 80 nm n - doped al@xmath10ga@xmath11as layer , and a 5 nm gaas cap .",
    "the carrier concentration and the mobility of the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in this heterostructure are @xmath12@xmath13 and @xmath14@xmath13/v@xmath15s , respectively , which were measured in the dark at @xmath16k .",

    "the height of the particles was set to be @xmath17 nm , so the easy axis of the particles is nearly perpendicular to the 2deg plane due to the dominance of shape anisotropy ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the particles in sample ( a ) were grown at a faster rate than those in sample ( b ) , so the diameters of particles @xmath20 and @xmath21 are expected to be smaller than those of particles @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the size of the hall crosses in both samples , which were fabricated with electron beam lithography followed by wet chemical etching , is about @xmath25@xmath9m@xmath19 . by proper gating of the 2deg , and using a gradiometry setup in which the differential hall voltage between an empty hall cross and a hall cross with nanoparticles grown on top is measured @xcite , moment sensitivity of submicron magnetometers has been improved to better than @xmath26@xmath27/hz@xmath28 at 1hz in a large applied magnetic field @xcite .",

    "fig.2 shows a typical hysteresis curve ( raw data ) measured at @xmath29k and @xmath31@xmath30 , where @xmath32 is the angle between the applied magnetic field and the easy axis of the fe nanoparticle .",
    "the large nonlinear background originates from the mesoscopic effects in the small 2deg structure at low temperatures .",
    "the observation of the switching of one particle instead of two is not surprising : from simple calculations the hall signal from particle @xmath20 is estimated to be about one order of magnitude larger than that of particle @xmath21 .",
    "in fact , the signal from particle @xmath21 is below the noise level and thus undetectable in our measurements .",
    "when the magnetic field is applied parallel to the easy axis , the net hysteresis curve , obtained by subtracting the nonlinear background , has a nearly rectangular shape @xcite . from the hall signal at zero field , the magnetic moment of the particle",

    "the diameter of particle @xmath20 is estimated to be @xmath34 nm , which is much smaller than the coherence diameter of fe nanowires ( 11 nm ) .",
    "the dominance of exchange interaction at this length scale favors a single domain structure .",
    "indeed , we found that the hysteresis curve of this particle is independent of field sweep history as long as the field is swept from above the switching fields , suggesting that this cylinder - shaped particle is a single - domain particle at least by the static definition @xcite .",
    "the magnetization reversal of a perfect nanowire with @xmath35 can be described by coherent rotation .",
    "the corresponding angular dependence of the switching fields is well described by the stoner - wohlfarth model @xcite , and can be written as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the anisotropy field .",
    "as shown in fig.3 , the measured angular dependence of the switching fields of particle @xmath20 deviates significantly from that expected from coherent rotation .",
    "the switching fields at lower angles are much lower than those for coherent rotation . at high angles ,",
    "the switching fields decrease rapidly with decreasing @xmath32 , which is similar to previous results on fe nanoparticle arrays with @xmath38 - 14 nm @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , we notice that the switching field at @xmath39@xmath30 appears to be slightly lower than that at @xmath40@xmath30 , which might be regarded as a weak signature of coherent rotation suggested in ref.@xcite for similar effects in ni nanowires .",

    "the spreading width of the switching fields is shown by the height of the bars in inset(b ) , which is the statistical standard deviation of @xmath43 obtained from the histogram measurements.,width=283 ]    the deviation from coherent rotation is further manifested in the histogram measurements .",
    "the stochastic nature of the switching process causes the spreading of the switching fields in a certain range . in the nel - brown model @xcite , the magnetization reversal of a dynamic single domain particle at finite temperature",
    "is described as thermal activation over a single energy barrier .",
    "kurkijrvi developed a formalism mathematically connecting the switching statistics to the energy barrier @xcite .",
    "measurements on individual ellipsoidal co nanoparticles of @xmath44 nm by wernsdorfer et al.provided the first experimental agreement with the nel - brown model @xcite .",
    "this model predicts an increase of the spreading width and a decrease in the average switching field @xmath41 with increasing temperature .",
    "this is not the case for particle @xmath20 .",
    "as shown in the inset of fig.3 , the spreading width does not increase with temperature .",
    "the spreading width estimated from kurkijrvi s formulas is at least one order of magnitude smaller than our experimental value ( @xmath452@xmath46 of the @xmath43 at t=15 k ) .",
    "similar wide distribution of @xmath43 has also been observed in electrodeposited ni nanowires with d=75 nm @xcite .",
    "the observed @xmath41 does decrease with temperature as expected from thermal activation , but it decreases much faster than the prediction of the nel - brown model .",
    "the extracted energy barrier , @xmath47 , is @xmath48k from the data at @xmath42@xmath30 and @xmath49 - 45k ( inset b in fig.3 ) , corresponding to a thermal activation volume of @xmath50nm@xmath51 , which is only about 1/5 of the total volume of the nanocylinder .",
    "this is consistent with previous magnetic viscosity measurements on large arrays of similar fe nanoparticles , in which the thermal activation volume was also found to be a small fraction of the particles total volume @xcite .",
    "similar results were also reported on electrodeposited ni nanowires @xcite .",
    "the data presented above clearly suggest that the magnetization reversal of particle @xmath20 is an incoherent process in which the nucleation is localized and thermally assisted , despite the fact that this particle has a diameter smaller than the coherence diameter .",
    "recent micromagnetic simulation of defect - free d=9 nm fe nanopillars by brown et al.@xcite showed that nucleation can start at both ends and propagate through the whole pillars in the time scale of nanoseconds .",
    "the calculated @xmath43 is about 2koe for the fields applied parallel to the easy axis , which is close to our experimental value .",
    "another theoretical work by skomski et al",
    ".  found that disorder such as structural imperfections favor the localized magnetization reversal over the delocalized modes such as coherent rotation and curling @xcite .",
    "the fe nanoparticles fabricated with stm are polycrystalline @xcite , so multiple nucleation sites including both the ends and the imperfections ( e.g.  grain boundaries ) are probably involved in the switching process . on the other hand",
    ", the single - domain static state of this particle suggests that these defects are still not strong enough to serve as pinning centers for domain walls , which are overwhelmed by magnetic exchange between strongly interacting magnetic clusters ( grains ) favoring a uniform spin distribution .",
    "it will be of particular interest to study how these structural imperfections affect the propagation process after the nucleation , which may determine the ultimate speed of spintronic devices based on such elongated nanoparticles or similar nanostructures .",

    "as a first step toward the study of domain wall motion on the 10 nm scale , we now demonstrate that elongated fe nanoparticles with domain walls can be fabricated with the stm - cvd technique .",
    "fig.4(a ) shows the hysteresis curve of the sample ( b ) taken at @xmath52k and with the field applied nearly parallel to the easy axis , in which only two particles ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) are close to the active region of the hall cross .",
    "after subtraction of the nonlinear background , we obtain a rectangular shaped net hysteresis curve , shown in the lower - right inset of fig.4(a ) , which exhibits two distinct sharp jumps in the hall signal .",
    "we attribute these two jumps to the magnetization reversal of the particle @xmath22 alone , instead of both particles @xmath22 and @xmath23 , based on the following experimental results : ( 1 ) although the sum of the two jumps in the hall signal corresponding to the two magnetization reversals , @xmath59 , remains constant , the ratio , @xmath60 , varies from 1.1 to 1.9 in different measurements ; ( 2 ) the size of particle @xmath23 is expected to be smaller than particle @xmath22 , and the location of particle @xmath23 is more off - center than particle @xmath22 , so the contribution of particle @xmath23 to the hall signal , if observable , would be smaller than that of particle @xmath22 . from the hall signal , we estimate that the diameter of particle @xmath22 to be about 10 - 15 nm @xcite .",

    "( b ) angular dependence of the switching fields of the same particle at @xmath29k.,width=283 ]    the inhomogeneous nature of the particle is further evidenced by the measurements in tilted fields .",
    "fig.4(b ) shows part of four hysteresis loops taken at exactly the same conditions ( @xmath53@xmath30 and @xmath29k ) . among them",
    ", two loops have four switching events ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 ) , while the other two only have three ( @xmath58 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 ) .",
    "similar stochastic switching behavior has also been observed at other field tilting angles .",
    "the number of switching events for each magnetization reversal varies from two to as many as five [ fig.5(a ) ] .",
    "the angular dependence of the switching fields for a typical field sweep is plotted in fig.5(b ) .",
    "the distribution of switching fields shows a very complex behavior .",
    "nonetheless , the switching fields at high angles ( @xmath62@xmath30 ) are divided into two distinctive groups : a soft group ( with lower switching fields ) having a weak angular dependence and a hard group with a strong angular dependence similar to that for a typical single - domain elongated fe nanoparticle such as particle @xmath20 .",
    "the multiple switching events and their angular dependence suggest that the soft portion of particle @xmath22 is probably composed of interacting clusters with varying easy axes .",
    "the magnetic structure of this particle can be modified by changes in the field sweep history , which is illustrated in fig.6 : as the field is swept between @xmath63koe and 5koe , switching of both the soft and the hard portions takes place ( middle curve ) . on the other hand , the upper and the lower hysteresis curves correspond to field sweeps between @xmath64koe and 2koe , in which only the magnetization of the soft portion switches .",
    "these two curves were taken under the same conditions except for the starting field : the upper and lower curves were obtained after the field was ramped to @xmath63koe and 5koe , respectively .",
    "the overall features of the two hysteresis curves are very similar , however , neither is symmetric with respect to @xmath65 .",
    "they are shifted in opposite directions in @xmath66 , resulting in a large difference ( @xmath67koe ) in the switching fields . the observed large difference in @xmath43 of the soft portion",
    "can clearly be attributed to the difference in the magnetization direction of the particle s hard portion .",
    "accordingly , the configuration of the domain wall(s ) between the soft portion and hard portion is varied due to different field sweep history , which in turn has a large effect on the switching of neighboring domains through the exchange interaction .",
    "it should be noted that multiple switching jumps have also been observed in electrodeposited ni @xcite and permalloy @xcite nanowires with @xmath68 - 90 nm to which the curling mode would be applicable if the nanowires were perfect .",
    "three hysteresis loops of particle @xmath22 with different field sweep histories .",

    "5koe@xmath69 @xmath63koe , in which both the soft and the hard portions of the particle are switched .",

    ", width=283 ]    the existence of domain walls in particle @xmath22 and its absence in particle @xmath20 as well as fe nanowires of larger size prepared by electrodeposition @xcite can be attributed to the growth process .",
    "the growth of particle @xmath22 was performed with lower precursor pressure and its growth rate was only about 1/4 of that of particle @xmath20 .",
    "the growth of the fe nanoparticles is sustained by maintaining a constant tunneling current ( typically 50pa ) , so a slower growth rate is likely to produce more structural defects since the growth process suffers more external ( mechanical and electronic ) interference .",
    "some of these imperfections provide the pinning forces for the domain walls .",
    "depending on temperature , applied fields , and the strength of each pinning center , a domain wall may or may not be pinned down at a particular place , resulting in stochastic behavior of the magnetization reversal . furthermore , the larger diameter of particle @xmath22 may also be responsible for the observed multi - domain structure due to the less dominant exchange interaction . finally , we speculate that there is a slight possibility that there exists some degree of surface oxidation which would provide extra pinning forces and nucleation sites for particle @xmath22@xcite .",
    "these surface interactions might also provide a possible explanation for the observed asymmetry in the hysteresis loops at low temperatures .",
    "a quantitative analysis of these effects , however , requires detailed information on the microstructure of the nanoparticles , which is not possible with our current experimental setup .",
    "in summary , two types of elongated fe nanoparticles with diameter close to the coherence diameter have been studied in detail .",
    "one has a single domain static state , but the magnetization reversal can not be described with coherent rotation .",
    "the data suggest a thermally activated nucleation and propagation process , in which possible nucleation sites include the ends and imperfections of the nanocylinder .",
    "the other type of fe particles studied in this work has a multi - domain structure and shows complicated magnetization reversal behavior .",
    "we have demonstrated that the domain structure in these fe nanoparticles can be manipulated through the magnetic field history .",
    "the capability of submicron hall magnetometry in detecting the magnetization reversal of single domains on the sub-10 nm scale demonstrated in this work is promising for important applications in understanding the fundamental physics at dimensions comparable to magnetic exchange lengths , as well as nascent fields such as bio - sensing and non - invasive detection of spin - polarized carriers injected into semiconductors .",
