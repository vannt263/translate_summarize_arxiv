    "leptogenesis is an attractive way of generating the baryon number of the universe  @xcite .",
    "the main idea put forward by fukugita and yanagida  @xcite is that a lepton number asymmetry can be produced in the decays of heavy sterile neutrinos into leptons and higgs bosons and such an asymmetry is partially transferred to the baryon sector through electroweak sphaleron processes  @xcite that violate @xmath2 and @xmath1 but not @xmath0 .",
    "the mechanism requires lepton number and @xmath5 violation , ensured by neutrino majorana masses and complex yukawa couplings . both masses and couplings form the well known seesaw model  @xcite of light neutrino masses and",
    "thus establish a close relation between baryogenesis and low energy phenomenology .",
    "the third sakharov condition  @xcite , the departure from thermal equilibrium , is satisfied in the delayed decay scenario .",
    "it means here that the majorana neutrinos live longer than the age of the universe when they approach non - relativistic temperatures and their production is boltzmann suppressed .",
    "it turns out that such condition puts an upper bound on the natural order of magnitude of the light neutrino masses  @xcite well below the mass scale indicated by the atmospheric neutrino anomaly  @xcite .",
    "this natural bound can be circumvented to some extent by fine - tuning the parameters to maximize the produced @xmath5 asymmetry but even so a quasi - degenerate light neutrino spectrum is excluded  @xcite .    as the seesaw provides a simple and elegant neutrino mass mechanism , it would be nice to have a naturally successful leptogenesis mechanism in the case where all heavy neutrinos have prompt rather than delayed decays .",
    "given that the heavy neutrino majorana masses and yukawa couplings provide the necessary @xmath0 and @xmath5 violations the main concern is to satisfy the out - of - equilibrium condition .",
    "this is naturally achieved by assuming that the heavy sterile neutrinos do not couple to the inflaton field and are only thermally produced during the radiation era from standard lepton and higgs particles . before the heavy neutrinos reach thermal equilibrium abundances a non - zero @xmath0 asymmetry can in principle be generated .",
    "that is the subject of this paper .    in the next section",
    "we describe the mechanism in more detail and in the following ones we present the main results concerning first , the generation of the primary @xmath0 asymmetry and second , the protection mechanism that prevents @xmath0 from being completely washed out when the lepton number violating reactions reach thermal equilibrium . in the last section",
    "we summarize the mechanism and make a brief discussion .",
    "the seesaw mechanism adds to the standard model singlet ( left - handed ) neutrinos , @xmath6 , with heavy majorana masses and yukawa couplings to the standard lepton and higgs doublets , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , of the form @xmath9 spontaneous breaking of su(2 ) @xmath10 u(1 ) yields the light neutrino mass matrix ( @xmath11 ) @xmath12 the proper decay rate of @xmath6 into leptons and higgs is @xmath13 .",
    "delayed decay occurs when the ratio to the hubble expansion rate , @xmath14 , is small at the temperature @xmath15 . in the radiation era , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the number of relativistic degrees of freedom , 107.5 in the standard model .",
    "it is enough to compare the sum @xmath18 v^2}{10^{-3 } \\ ; \\mathrm{ev}}\\ ] ] with the light neutrino scale @xmath19 $ ] to conclude that the delayed decay condition , @xmath20 , is in general in conflict with the atmospheric neutrino mass gap  @xcite , @xmath21 , which implies @xmath22 . strictly speaking",
    ", the delayed decay scenario only requires that the lightest of the heavy neutrinos satisfies @xmath20 , and larger @xmath23 values are tolerated for a certain choice of parameters that maximize the @xmath5 asymmetry  @xcite . but that is not the most natural picture , in particular if the light neutrinos are quasi - degenerate  @xcite .",
    "as it turns out , there is a simple modification of the original leptogenesis mechanism capable of realizing the out - of - equilibrium condition and producing a large lepton asymmetry . according to the inflation paradigm  @xcite ,",
    "the radiation era starts when a scalar field , so - called inflaton , decays and transforms its energy into the form of particles so constituting the initial thermal bath .",
    "if sterile neutrinos do not couple to the inflaton , they can be only thermally produced from standard lepton and higgs particles through yukawa interactions .",
    "these processes are naturally out - of - equilibrium at very high temperatures and it takes some time before sterile neutrinos reach thermal equilibrium densities . during that period",
    "there is a clear departure from equilibrium and a @xmath0 asymmetry can be generated .    in this scenario",
    "a primary lepton asymmetry is generated in the lepton doublet and sterile neutrino sectors .",
    "a fraction of it is transferred to the bottom @xmath24 , tau @xmath25 , charm @xmath26 and other right - handed fermions through slow yukawa interactions .",
    "another fraction is converted into baryon number by weak sphaleron processes .",
    "it is crucial for the survival of such baryon number and @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , ... asymmetries that the heavy majorana neutrinos decay and vanish from the universe before the weak sphalerons or @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) yukawa couplings enter in equilibrium , which happens at a temperature around  @xcite @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) . by that time",
    "the @xmath29 reactions mediated by off - shell majorana neutrinos should also be out - of - equilibrium .",
    "in other words , the moment when the @xmath29 reactions freeze out determines which decoupled sectors or quantum numbers protect and store a fraction of the primary @xmath0 asymmetry .",
    "their rate relates to the sum of light neutrino square masses @xmath30 $ ] as @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "they are out of equilibrium , i.e. , @xmath32 , at temperatures below @xmath33 we assume of course that the masses @xmath34 are larger than @xmath35 so that the heavy neutrinos vanish above that temperature .",
    "@xmath36 ( @xmath28 ) for neutrino masses @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , well above the atmospheric neutrino mass gap . as will be shown below , if @xmath39 then the baryon number sector and the right - handed quark @xmath24 have the dominant role in protecting @xmath0 and producing the present baryon number of the universe .",
    "if @xmath3 exceeds @xmath4 that role would be played by the charm quark @xmath26 but not efficiently enough to produce the present baryon asymmetry .",
    "we assume that the universe is initially empty of sterile neutrinos , not produced in the inflaton decay but only thermally from standard leptons and higgs . for definiteness",
    "we assume a reheating temperature much higher than the neutrino masses .",
    "the dominant production reaction is the higgs boson decay into leptons and neutrinos , @xmath40 , allowed by a higgs thermal mass , @xmath41  @xcite , much higher than the lepton thermal masses .",
    "the yukawa top quark scattering processes like @xmath42 and other channels contribute to not more than 40 % of the total @xmath6 production rate . the higgs boson proper decay rate into @xmath6 is @xmath43 per isospin state . in the radiation era",
    "the initially zero neutrino densities @xmath44 converge to the fermion equilibrium density @xmath45 with relaxation temperatures @xmath46 : @xmath47 as a consequence of the prompt decay assumption , @xmath48 , sterile neutrinos reach thermal equilibrium while they are still ultra relativistic .",
    "leptogenesis is dominated by the following @xmath5 asymmetric reactions : higgs decays into leptons and sterile neutrinos , inverse decays and scatterings of leptons off neutrinos .",
    "the asymmetries result from the interference between the diagrams on the left side of figure [ fig1 ] with the absorptive part of the respective diagram on the right - hand side .",
    "unitarity and @xmath49 invariance impose constraints on the reaction rates such that when all particles are in thermal equilibrium the asymmetry source terms cancel each other  @xcite . generically denoting the difference between the total rates of a reaction @xmath50 and its @xmath5-conjugate @xmath51 as @xmath52 ( in a fixed comoving volume ) ,",
    "the relevant constraints are expressed in terms of thermal equilibrium rates as :    ( | n_a l_i ) _ + ( n_a l_i | ) _ = 0 , [ cpta ] + ( n_a l_i n_b l_j ) _ + ( n_b l_j n_a l_i ) _ = 0 , [ cptb ] + ( n_a l_i | ) _ + _ bj ( n_a l_i n_b l_j ) _",
    "= 0 [ cptc ] .",
    "the evolution of the set of observables @xmath53 is governed by the boltzmann equations , whose general structure is , integrating over a constant comoving volume , @xmath54 . the first are transport terms and @xmath55 stand for source terms .",
    "the particle asymmetry sources vanish in thermal equilibrium but , as long as the @xmath6 neutrinos stay rarefied , scatterings and inverse decays do not match higgs decays and particle asymmetries develop in the various lepton flavors , sterile neutrinos , and higgs boson as well , as enforced by hypercharge conservation .",
    "the calculation of the source terms is simplified by employing boltzmann rather than quantum statistics as is common practice .",
    "relating the out - of - equilibrium and thermal equilibrium reaction rates as @xmath56 for @xmath57 , and @xmath58 for @xmath59 , one derives from the above @xmath49 and unitarity constraints the @xmath7 lepton number sources , @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the higgs abundance per isospin state .",
    "sterile neutrinos also have lepton number , @xmath64 for left - handed @xmath6 fields and @xmath65 for the conjugate @xmath66 .",
    "but what matters for particle propagation and transport of lepton number are the spin eigenstates rather than chiral states . when neutrinos are ultra relativistic , helicity and chiral states are almost identical , but when they are non - relativistic majorana masses take over and lepton number vanishes .",
    "in fact , a positive ( negative ) helicity eigenstate has a well defined lepton number expectation value equal to the neutrino speed @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "helicity is not an invariant quantity , however , there is a privileged reference frame , the comoving thermal bath rest frame . in that frame",
    ", isotropy ensures that the spin density matrix is diagonal in the helicity basis .",
    "this is not true in any other frame , and means that neutrinos can be divided in two populations of opposite helicities .    under the non - equilibrium conditions of the leptogenesis era the two neutrino helicity populations develop unequal abundances and net lepton numbers in much the same way as the standard leptons . from the same decay , inverse decay and scattering processes",
    "one derives the @xmath69 lepton number source terms , @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a coefficient estimated to be of the order but larger than unit . summing both lepton and neutrino contributions ,",
    "one obtains the total @xmath0 asymmetry as a function of the temperature : @xmath72 ^ 2}{(h^\\dagger h)_{aa } } \\frac{m_a m_b } { t_a^{2 } } f\\left(\\frac{t_a}{t } \\right ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath73 , @xmath74 is the massless fermion thermal abundance and @xmath75 .",
    "the other question is how fast majorana masses erase lepton number . in a decay @xmath40",
    ", lepton number suffers a variation @xmath76 if @xmath6 has positive helicity , which occurs with a branching fraction of about @xmath77 .",
    "it makes an average variation @xmath78 per decay and the @xmath6 production rates through higgs decays are equal to @xmath79 with @xmath80 .",
    "thus , lepton number violation enters in equilibrium at a temperature @xmath81 , i.e. , @xmath82 the @xmath76 scattering processes mediated by majorana neutrinos like @xmath83 , that are so important when the majorana neutrinos are non relativistic and even at lower temperatures when they are off - shell , are completely negligible in comparison with the higgs boson decays @xmath84 transitions at relativistic temperatures .",
    "the relative strength is of the order of @xmath85 . for constants @xmath23 as large as 200 ,",
    "the sterile neutrinos enter in thermal equilibrium at temperatures @xmath86 but the majorana masses , i.e. , the @xmath87 transitions only enter in equilibrium at @xmath88 , where @xmath89 denotes the largest of the majorana masses .",
    "@xmath90 is quite smaller than the relaxation temperatures @xmath91 and the larger the @xmath23 constants are the smaller is @xmath90 in comparison with @xmath91 .",
    "at temperatures above @xmath90 , @xmath0 is not significantly damped and is slowly transferred via yukawa interactions to the right - handed leptons and quarks , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( with the exception of the top , @xmath95 , very early in chemical equilibrium ) .",
    "the dominant processes are higgs boson decays into leptons  @xcite , @xmath96 , kinematically forbidden in the case of quarks due to comparable quark thermal masses  @xcite , and scatterings like @xmath97 , @xmath98 .",
    "these processes generate the otherwise zero asymmetries @xmath99 and @xmath100 , @xmath101 . for right - handed quarks , the contrast asymmetries with respect to the up quark",
    "@xmath102 are the appropriate charges because , contrary to the individual flavor asymmetries , they are conserved by qcd instantons  @xcite and are only violated by yukawa couplings .",

    "weak sphalerons transfer part of the @xmath0 asymmetry to the baryon sector and the baryon number growth rate  @xcite in a volume @xmath112 is given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the sphaleron diffusion rate .",
    "the integration of the above equations requires knowing the relations between the chemical potentials and the leptogenesis sources given in equations ( [ lis ] ) and ( [ lbs ] ) . in general",
    "there is no direct relation because the partial particle asymmetries are not conserved due to flavor changing yukawa couplings .",
    "as soon as the first neutrino , say @xmath115 , is in equilibrium ( @xmath116 ) , the heavy neutrino and standard lepton flavors are rapidly violated enforcing their chemical potentials @xmath117 to be identical : @xmath118 .",
    "the higgs communicates also its asymmetry to @xmath95 and top quark doublet : @xmath119 .",
    "because the @xmath120 asymmetries increase rapidly with time , initially as @xmath121 , we concentrate on the latest period before @xmath90 , where sterile neutrinos are already in equilibrium but majorana masses do not violate lepton number fast enough to yield null neutrino chemical potentials . equations ( [ qei])-([dbdt ] ) can be written in the form @xmath122 where the coefficients @xmath123 are constant in a radiation dominated universe but depend on the all set of chemical potential constraints .",
