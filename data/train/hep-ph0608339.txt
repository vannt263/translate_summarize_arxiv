    "the perturbative series for qcd observables is not convergent , the @xmath1-order coefficients exhibiting @xmath2 growth at large @xmath3 . in the borel plane",
    "there are singularities along the real axis : ultraviolet ( uv ) renormalons along the negative real semi - axis , and infrared ( ir ) renormalons lying on the integration contour , along the positive real semi - axis .",
    "the latter render the borel integral ambiguous , the ambiguity being structurally identical to ambiguities arising in the non - perturbative operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite .",
    "consequently , all - orders perturbation theory is only well - defined if supplemented by the non - perturbative ope , allowing the ambiguities to cancel .    in practice",
    "all - orders calculations are only possible in the `` leading-@xmath4 approximation '' , in which the @xmath1-order perturbative coefficient is recast as an expansion in powers of @xmath5 , the first beta - function coefficient ( in su@xmath6 qcd , with @xmath7 active quark flavours ) . the `` leading-@xmath4 '' term ( proportional to @xmath8 )",
    "is then used to approximate the @xmath1-order coefficient @xcite .",
    "crucially this term can be identified to all - orders from large @xmath7 calculations , involving a restricted set of diagrams in which a chain of @xmath3 fermion bubbles is inserted into a basic `` skeleton '' diagram , in all possible ways . in this way",

    "the matched leading-@xmath4 resummed result consequently depends on the assumed renormalization scale at which the matching takes place . to avoid this ambiguity",
