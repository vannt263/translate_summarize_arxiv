    "<S> we describe a nonperturbative ( in @xmath0 ) numerical evaluation of the one - photon electron self energy for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 states in hydrogenlike atomic systems with charge numbers @xmath5 to 5 . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results are found to be in agreement with known terms in the expansion of the self energy in powers of @xmath0 and lead to improved theoretical predictions for the self - energy shift of these states .    in this brief report </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the one - loop self - energy shift for excited @xmath6 states in hydrogenlike systems . </S>",
    "<S> high - accuracy numerical calculations of this effect are notoriously difficult especially in the region of low nuclear charge numbers @xmath7 , because the renormalization entails a loss of up to nine decimal figures in the numerical calculation ( the bound - electron self - energy is a residual effect which corresponds to the difference of the divergent self - energy of the bound electron , minus the corresponding , also divergent , shift for a free electron ) .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the calculations are needed for a self - consistent determination of fundamental constants , which relies on the experimental / theoretical analysis of a number of hydrogenic transitions .    </S>",
    "<S> one may obtain rather accurate values for the so - called self - energy remainder functions by an interpolation  @xcite of results for high and low nuclear charge numbers , which rely on two different approaches : ( i ) direct numerical calculations at high nuclear charge numbers ( see e.g.  @xcite , no @xmath0-expansion ) , and ( ii ) analytic calculations at low nuclear charge numbers , employing the @xmath0-expansion ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in this case , the values obtained for low nuclear charge depend on the interpolation method used , as well as ( of course ) on the reliability of both the numerical calculations at high @xmath7 and the analytic calculations for low nuclear charge number .    here , </S>",
    "<S> we follow a third approach and calculate the self - energy without @xmath0-expansion , at low @xmath7 , using a method described previously in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> essentially , this method relies on an adequate formulation of the physical problem , by which divergent terms are suitably identified and calculated separately using semi - analytic approaches , and on the use of efficient numerical methods for the high - accuracy calculation of the green function of the relativistic electron and for the evaluation of slowly convergent sums of intermediate angular momenta ( it might be useful to mention the keyword `` convergence acceleration '' in that context  @xcite ) . on modern computer processors , </S>",
    "<S> it is not even necessary to parallelize the calculation ; that latter approach had previously been employed in  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> all calculations reported here are carried out in the no - recoil limit , which corresponds to an infinitely heavy nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> it might be instructive to recall the following subtlety , which is well known , and to include a slight detour : at the current level of accuracy and especially at low @xmath7 , the reduced - mass dependence of the self energy should be included for a comparison of the effect with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> this can be done _ a posteriori _ by considering the semi - analytic expansion in eq .  </S>",
