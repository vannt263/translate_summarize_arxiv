    "renewed interest in kohn s theorem on decomposing a system of charged particles in a magnetic field into center - of - mass and relative coordinates stems from relating it to the newton - hooke symmetry of the landau problem @xcite .",

    "remember that , in dimension @xmath0 , both the newton - hooke and the galilei groups have a one - parameter central extension , but in the plane they both admit an `` exotic '' , _ two - parameter _ central extension @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we focus our attention at the newton - hooke case , the galilean one being rather well - known .",
    "the ordinary landau problem admits the one - parameter centrally extended newton - hooke group as symmetry @xcite , but the `` exotic '' [ non - commutative ] version has indeed the two - parameter version @xcite . in the hill case , rotation - less `` newton - hooke type '' symmetry , with one ( or , in the `` exotic '' case , with two )",
    "central extensions could be established @xcite .",
    "then our main result , proved in section [ orbitconst ] , says  :    : _ the most general planar system with newton  hooke - type symmetry is a ( possibly non - commutative ) anisotropic oscillator in a uniform magnetic background .",

    "the proof will be accomplished by applying the _ orbit method _ , which provides us indeed with all systems upon which the symmetry group acts transitively @xcite .",

    "conversely , combining two @xmath1d chiral oscillators may yield the non - commutative landau problem @xcite ; then the chiral method allows for an elegant derivation of the ( newton - hooke ) symmetry .",

    "we also study the arising of further symmetries and explain the difference between symmetry with or without rotations .",
    "our results allow us to deduce  :    : _ the system is either a truly anisotropic oscillator with newton - hooke - type symmetry only and no rotations , or it is isotropic with full newton - hooke symmetry , including rotations .",
