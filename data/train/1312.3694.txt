    "the last two decades have seen an increasing interest in phase - changing materials ( pcm ) , such as ge - sb - te ( gst ) , as promising candidates for next - generation nonvolatile memory devices @xcite .",
    "these materials display ultrafast and reversible phase transitions between their crystalline and amorphous states at high temperature , while displaying remarkable stability at low temperatures .",
    "their potential originates from the striking differences in electrical and optical properties exhibited by each phase , which can reach several orders of magnitude in some instances @xcite .",
    "these two properties of gst materials reversible kinetics and high contrast in phase properties makes them ideal candidates for memory applications .",
    "generally , a phase transformation is induced by some controlled external heat source that drives the system above the transition threshold .",
    "however , a complete understanding of these fast phase transformations at ultra high heating rates and their remarkable properties is still lacking .",
    "even for single component systems such as ge , the crystalline structures induced by laser - heating of amorphous thin films are very complex and depend on many factors such as the deposition history and morphology of the amorphous structure , the intensity and duration of the heating pulse , and the substrate structure , among others @xcite .",
    "the interplay between all these processes governs the kinetic and thermodynamic evolution of pcm , which must be understood in terms of the microscopic properties of each phase .",
    "modeling and simulation can provide physical insight into the governing phenomena , as well as a path to understanding the physical evolution of pcm under the conditions just discussed .",
    "the goal of this paper is two - fold : ( i ) to present a novel multiscale model for phase transformations in a heat bath at constant temperature ; and ( ii ) to obtain scaling laws for ge - crystal mean radius evolution as a function of the nucleation rate during the recrystallization process .",
    "our approach consists of a thermodynamically consistent phase field model ( tcpf ) that reproduces _ exactly _ the interface energetics and kinetics of atomistically computed crystallization fronts . as an additional feature , the interface thickness may be chosen arbitrarily large while preserving this exact atomistic - to - continuum coupling , thus delivering a highly efficient multiscale computational model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin in section [ sec : physicalmodel ] by discussing the physical processes captured by the model ( nucleation , growth , role of anisotropy , etc . ) and the boundary conditions employed . in section [ sec : methods ] we describe the mathematical formulation of the tcpf model , and prove that the energetics and kinetics of planar fronts at constant temperature obey universal relations when expressed in appropriate non - dimensional units .",
    "these relations lead to a direct correspondence between the phase field parameters and physical quantities that can be measured via atomistic simulations , and thus provide with an accurate coupling strategy between the two scales .",
    "additionally , in the same section , we present detailed information on the evaluation of continuum data from atomistic calculations , namely , the free energies for each of the faces , the interface velocities and the transformation pathway between the amorphous and crystalline phase .",
    "next , in section [ sec : results ] we show the results of the atomistic calculations as a function of temperature and interface orientation , compute the invariance solutions of the allen - cahn equations and obtain the related phase field parameters . following these results",
    ", we use the developed multiscale model to analyze , in section [ sec : discussions ] , the interplay between nucleation and growth during crystallization kinetics under isotropic and anisotropic growth conditions .",
    "we conclude the paper in section [ sec : summary ] , with a summary of the results .",
    "when an amorphous ge thin film is heated above the glass transition temperature ( @xmath0 ) but below the melting temperature ( @xmath1 ) , it spontaneously crystallizes .",
    "the difference in free energies between the two phases constitutes the driving force for crystallization , which decreases with temperature . at the same time",
    ", the mobilities and nucleation rates rapidly increase as the temperature rises . for most pcms",
    ", there is an intermediate temperature at which an optimal compromise is achieved , and the crystallization rate is maximized . for ge ,",
    "such temperature is around @xmath2 k , cf .",
    "[ sec : results_md ] , which can be achieved , for instance , by high - intensity pulsed laser heating @xcite . under those conditions ,",
    "crystals nucleate and grow until full impingement is achieved .",
    "complete crystallization occurs over tens of nanoseconds , and the resulting crystals have a mean radius of tens of nanometers @xcite .",
    "experiments suggest that nucleation occurs homogeneously in space throughout the thin film with no preferential texture , which typically indicates heterogeneous nucleation at uniformly distributed imperfections and/or irregularities in the amorphous microstructure . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", nucleation is ill - defined despite substantial efforts @xcite , and here the nucleation rate is simply taken taken as a parameter of the model , which can be changed to understand its effect on the overall crystallization process .",
    "once crystals have nucleated , they grow by front propagation in the surrounding amorphous material , or , if in contact with another crystal , by grain boundary motion . in this paper , we focus solely on the former , and leave the study of coarsening of the recrystallized nanograined material for future studies .    the mesoscopic time and length scales involved in the crystallization process ( microns and tens of nanoseconds ) are prohibitive for fully atomistic simulations .",
    "hence , in this paper we adopt a computational approach based on the phase field equations parameterized with atomistic data .",
    "the details of the method are described in the following section . in the remainder of the paper",
    "it will be assumed that the film is thin enough for critical nuclei to span the full thickness and for the problem to be treated as two - dimensional .",
    "furthermore we will consider that the amorphous thin film is free - standing and capable of fully releasing stresses via bending .",
    "the phase - field method is a computational approach widely used in modeling morphological and microstructural evolution in materials @xcite , including solidification @xcite , fracture @xcite , dislocation dynamics @xcite , crystal nucleation @xcite and growth @xcite , and diffusion processes @xcite , among others .",
    "the method uses a so - called phase - field variable , @xmath3 , to distinguish among the different material phases and implicitly track interface motion .",
    "for example , in this work we take @xmath4 to represent the crystalline phase , and @xmath5 for the amorphous region .",
    "the interface between the two phases is then described as a smooth transition of the variable @xmath3 through a small thickness .    in phase field models , the equilibrium configuration of a material point in homogeneous state is assumed to be characterized by a gibbs free energy @xmath6 that depends on the phase field variable and a set of thermodynamic state variables such as temperature and pressure .",

    "equation ( [ eq : phi_constantt ] ) determines the growth of existing nuclei .",
    "nucleation , for its part , is treated explicitly in this work by introducing cylindrical critical nuclei in the simulation with random orientation and with a probability that is consistent with a certain nucleation rate .",
