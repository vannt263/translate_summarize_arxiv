    ", we can only consider and bound one of these block contributions .",
    "let us consider such a block @xmath148 .",
    "it involves the gaussian integration : @xmath195 with @xmath196 defined as : @xmath197 the derivatives @xmath198 can be evaluated from the famous fa di bruno formula , extending the standard derivation rule for composed functions , and easily proved by induction : @xmath199 where @xmath200 runs over the partitions of the set @xmath201 and @xmath202 runs through the blocks of the partition @xmath200 . with this helpful result , and from the definitions [ slice ] and [ sliceweight ] , we have : @xmath203 a formula which can be easily extended for a derivative of degree @xmath204 as : @xmath205 where @xmath206 is the intersection of the gauge invariant subset @xmath207 with the support of the function @xmath208 on the slice @xmath120 and : @xmath209 the @xmath210-th derivative of @xmath211 can be deduced from fa di bruno formula . for @xmath204 : @xmath212^{m_l}.\\ ] ] in [ deff ] , we can rewrite the product as a product over the _ arcs _ of the vertices : @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the _ coordination number _ of the vertex @xmath170 , equal to the number of half lines of the intermediate - fields hooked to this vertex . then",
    ", the bosonic integral [ bosonicint ] becomes : @xmath215.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ boundresolvent ] because @xmath216 and @xmath217 are real , and @xmath218 is positive , @xmath219 obeys the following bounds : @xmath220 with @xmath221 -\\pi , \\pi [ $ ] .",
    "then , using the constraint : @xmath222 , with @xmath223 the number of vertices of @xmath148 , [ gaussianformula ] admits the bound : @xmath224.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that @xmath225 involves intermediate fields . defining : @xmath226 and",
    "since the gaussian measure @xmath227 is positive , we can use the cauchy - schwarz inequality to get : @xmath228 we shall treat separately each term , calling the first term the _ non - perturbative factor _ , and the second the _ perturbative factor _ , following the conventions of @xcite . note that in our derivation of the bound [ csbound ] , we have not considered the special case for which the tree has one vertex only .",
    "this particular contribution involves melonic vacuum diagrams , discarded by construction with their corresponding counter - terms , and non - melonic vacuum diagrams . because these diagrams are convergent",
    ", these contributions can be easily bounded , and they do not spoil the conclusion .",
    "we[sectionboundgauss ] begin with the first term , the non perturbative contribution : @xmath229 firstly , note that : @xmath230 . secondly ,",
    "because of the identity : @xmath231 we have , from lemma [ boundresolvent ] : @xmath232 and we get : @xmath233 using definition [ intermediatevec2 ] , @xmath234.\\ ] ] from definition [ deftrans ] of @xmath218 , and because the renormalized function @xmath235 behaves as @xmath236 , @xmath237 . similarly , @xmath238 .",
    "for @xmath19 small enough , we deduce that : @xmath239\\ ] ] since one more time , @xmath240 , it leads to @xmath241\\ ] ] where the notation @xmath242 stands for the highest of the numerical constants involved in the first bound .",
    "the term of degree @xmath52 in @xmath243 gives an effective variance @xmath244 , where @xmath245 is the matrix in the color space of intermediate fields with all entries equal to 1 , @xmath246 the identity matrix in the same space , and @xmath247 is the identity matrix in replica space .",
    "the gaussian integration is easy , and gives ( taking into account the normalization of original gaussian measure ) : @xmath248.\\ ] ] the determinant can be computed in terms of traces with the formula @xmath249 .",
    "denoting : @xmath250 we have : @xmath251 and , for the norm of @xmath252 : @xmath253 where in both cases we used the fact that all diagonal entries of @xmath254 are equal to @xmath70 . using the taylor expansion @xmath255 ,",
    "the two previous bounds imply : @xmath256 and for @xmath19 small enough , we find : @xmath257    we now move on to the perturbative bound : @xmath258 for @xmath259 we have : @xmath260 the last sum can be bounded by the integral over the volume of the intersection between the plane of @xmath261 of equation @xmath262 and the volume in between the hyper - spheres of equations @xmath263 and @xmath264 .",
    "this volume corresponds to the volume between the two spheres of @xmath265 of radius @xmath109 and @xmath266 , times a factor @xmath267 coming from the normalization of kronecker delta : @xmath268 and : @xmath269 the gaussian integrals can be computed more easily by reversing the field translation [ fieldtranslation ] . because , obviously : @xmath270 , we can treat the integral for the back - translated intermediate fields with the simple replacement : @xmath271 , and an additional factor @xmath272 .",
    "we then have a gaussian integral of the form : @xmath273 such an integral can be pictured as a graph with @xmath223 vertices , labeled by @xmath170 , and with @xmath170 half colored intermediate field lines hooked to them . by wick theorem , the gaussian integration joins together half lines between the vertices . in the worst case",
    "the graph has no loop , and because @xmath274 , it follows that the gaussian integration [ gaussianexemple ] is bounded by : latexmath:[\\ ] ] taking into account the bound [ boundcomb ] , in addition to the easy bound , coming from stirling formula : @xmath307 , and performing the sum over the @xmath68 , we find the final bound : @xmath309 ensures that , for @xmath310 sufficiently large , this factor compensates the bad divergence associated to @xmath311 .",
    "the radius of convergence is then finite , and the factor @xmath312 establishes the domain of uniform convergence as stated in theorem [ keythm ] .",
    "in this first constructive paper for super - renormalizable tgfts , we have successfully applied the multi - scale loop vertex expansion to the simplest super - renormalizable tgft .",
    "the theorem of this paper can easily be extended to connected schwinger functions , introducing additional resolvents for each pair of derivations with respect to the external sources .",
    "interestingly , the fact that the closure constraint reduces the intermediate fields freedom degrees to vector - like intermediate fields considerably simplified the proof of the convergence .",
    "in particular , in @xcite some technical difficulties occurring from the non - commutativity of the operators involved in the resolvents forced us to use complicated iterated cauchy - schwarz estimates . they disappear in our tgft thanks to the closure constraint .",
    "+ the next step of this constructive program would be to construct the same model for @xmath313 and @xmath314 .",
    "presumably , the extension to the @xmath313 case should be doable , because it is still super - renormalizable , and requires only of a finite number of subtractions .",
    "the just - renormalizable @xmath314 case , however , may be more difficult",
    ". however , a promising indication for the future is that this theory is ultra - violet asymptotically free .",
