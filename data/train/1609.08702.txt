    "m. mends france asked in @xcite if the function @xmath14 preserves simple normality with respect to the regular continued fraction for every non - zero rational @xmath13 .",
    "this was recently settled by j. vandehey @xcite who showed that @xmath34 is normal with respect to the continued fraction when @xmath6 is normal with respect to the continued fraction expansion and integers @xmath35and @xmath36 satisfy @xmath37 .",
    "work was also done on the normality preserving properties of the functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 for the cantor series expansions by the first and third author in @xcite and additonally with j. vandehey in @xcite .",
    "however , these functions are not well understood in this context .      in any topological space @xmath38 , the collection of borel sets",
    "@xmath39 is the smallest @xmath40-algebra containing the open sets .",
    "they are stratified into levels , the borel hierarchy , by defining @xmath41 the open sets , @xmath42 the closed sets , and for @xmath43 we let @xmath44 be the collection of countable unions @xmath45 where each @xmath46 for some @xmath47",

    "all of the collections @xmath55 , @xmath44 , @xmath56 are pointclasses , that is , they are closed under inverse images of continuous functions .",

    "h.  ki and t.  linton @xcite proved that the set @xmath0 is @xmath77-complete .",
    "further work was done by v.  becher , p.  a.  heiber , and t.  a.  slaman @xcite who settled a conjecture of a.  s.  kechris by showing that the set of absolutely normal numbers is @xmath77-complete .",
    "furthermore , v.  becher and t.  a.  slaman @xcite proved that the set of numbers normal in at least one base is @xmath78-complete .",
    "k.  beros considered sets involving normal numbers in the difference heirarchy in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath79 be the set of numbers normal of order @xmath80 in base @xmath1 .",
    "he proved that for @xmath5 and @xmath81 , the set @xmath82 is @xmath83-complete ( see @xcite for a definition of the difference hierarchy ) .",
    "additionally , the set @xmath84 is shown to be @xmath85-complete .",
    "we are interested in determining the exact descriptive set theoretic complexity of @xmath3 and some related sets .",
    "the definition of @xmath3 shows that @xmath3 is @xmath75 , since it involves a universal quantification .",
    "it is not immediately clear if @xmath3 is a borel set , but this in fact follows from a result of rauzy .",
    "specifically , rauzy @xcite characterized @xmath3 in terms of an entropy - like condition called the _",
    "noise_. we recall this condition and associated notation from @xcite . for any positive integer length @xmath86 ,",
    "let @xmath87 denote the set of functions from @xmath88 to @xmath1 .",
    "we call an @xmath89 a _ block function _ of width @xmath86 . as in @xcite",
    "we set , for @xmath90 , @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the ( fractional part ) of the base @xmath1 expansion of @xmath6 .",
    "we also let for @xmath93 @xmath94    we then define the lower and upper noises @xmath95 , @xmath96 of @xmath6 by : @xmath97 where @xmath98 the upper entropy @xmath96 is defined similarly using @xmath99 where @xmath100 for a fixed @xmath93 we also let @xmath101 and similarly for @xmath102 .",
    "rauzy showed that @xmath103 iff it has the maximal possible noise in that @xmath104 . furthermore , @xmath105 iff it has minmal possible noise in that @xmath106 .",

    "let @xmath110 finally , we let @xmath111    thus , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 .",
    "the ki - linton result shows that @xmath0 , and thus @xmath114 is @xmath2-complete for any base @xmath1 .",
    "recall also the becher - slaman result which shows that the set of reals which are normal to some base @xmath1 forms a @xmath115-complete set .",
    "we have the following complexity results .    [ mt ] for any @xmath116 , the set @xmath117 is @xmath4-complete and the set @xmath118 is @xmath2-complete . for any @xmath119 $ ] , the set @xmath120 is @xmath2-complete , and the set @xmath121 is @xmath122-complete . for @xmath123 ,",
    "the set @xmath124 is @xmath4-complete , and the set @xmath125 is @xmath2-complete .    as a corollary",
    "we obtain the ki - linton result as well as the determination of the exact complexity of @xmath3 .",
    "[ maincor ] the sets @xmath0 and @xmath3 are both @xmath2-complete .",
    "we have @xmath126 iff @xmath127 , and @xmath105 iff @xmath128 , so the result follows immeduately from theorem  [ mt ] .    in defining the noise ,",
    "it is sometimes convenient to use the minor variation @xmath129 that is , the block function predicts the next digit rather than the previous digit . in this case",
    "we must start the sum at @xmath130 rather than @xmath27 , but this does not affect any of the limits used in defining @xmath95 or @xmath96 .    in proving theorem  [ mt ] we will work with @xmath6 in the sequence space @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the set of @xmath133 which do not end in a tail of @xmath9 s .",
    "this is a polish space as @xmath134 is a compact polish space ( with the usual product of discrete topologies on @xmath135 ) and @xmath132 is a @xmath136 ( that is , @xmath122 ) subset of @xmath134 .",
    "this is permissible as the map @xmath137 given by @xmath138 is continuous .",
    "so , for example , given that @xmath139 is @xmath2-complete , where @xmath140 is defined as @xmath118 , except we consider directly @xmath133 , then it follows that @xmath118 is @xmath2-complete . for",

    "we remark on the significance of complexity classifications such theorem  [ mt ] . aside from the intrinsic interest to descriptive set theory , results of this form can be viewed as ruling out the existence of further theorems which would reduce the complexity of the sets .",
    "for example , rauzy s theorem reduces the complexity of @xmath3 from @xmath75 to @xmath2 . the fact that @xmath144 is @xmath2-complete tells us that there can not be other theorems which result in a yet simpler characterization of @xmath3 .",
