    "in the last few years , many techniques were developed to manipulate and control molecular processes by means of ultrashort laser pulses@xcite .",
    "initially , ultrashort pulses were used because they provided the means to act on the time - scale of fast molecular events@xcite . at a later stage , it was the broad pulse spectrum of the pulses that by phase modulation and learning algorithms , opened great opportunities to control the dynamics@xcite .",
    "more recently , the non - resonant strong - field interaction of the pulse provided a means to alter the potential energy surface of the molecule via dynamic stark effect ,  catalyzing  many photochemical processes@xcite .",
    "while all the previous roles remain useful for different purposes , one can arguably follow this sequence of events as one in which the laser is promoted from the role of a non - specific exciter ( and probe of the chemical process ) , to a reactant and then to a catalyst , using the chemical terminology . in this review",
    "we will outline some of our contributions in the control of molecules in the strong - field regime from a theoretical perspective .",
    "for a broader perspective the interested reader is referred to the following work and references therein@xcite .",
    "the application of strong pulses to atoms has a long history@xcite .",
    "here we are interested in non - ionizing effects , which require the use of moderately - strong pulses , typically within tens of tw/@xmath0 .",
    "thomas george and andre bandrauk developed a very useful ",
    "chemical  picture of light - induced events@xcite . in this picture , the slow effects of the field on the nuclei ( averaged over the radiation cycles ) are incorporated in the  dressed ",
    "( energy shifted ) molecular potentials .",
    "then , in the adiabatic representation , the dynamics of photodissociation or multiphoton processes are recast in terms of predissociation , avoided crossings , or other topological features .",
    "the adiabatic potentials that incorporate these laser - molecule coupling effects are called light - induced potentials@xcite ( lips ) , while the avoided crossings in the lips are called light - induced avoided crossings@xcite ( liacs ) . in polyatomic molecules , or taking into account the vectorial nature of the coupling , the liacs can be seen as light - induced conical intersections@xcite ( licis ) .",
    "considerable theoretical effort has been put recently at characterizing the licis .",
    "one of the first and most obvious applications of strong pulses is to enhance the yield of electronic absorption .",
    "however , because raman transitions can compete with absorption and the stark effect can decouple the electronic states , strong and ultrashort transformed - limited pulses do not lead to efficient population transfer@xcite .",
    "one needs to resort to adiabatic rapid passage ( arp ) by means of chirped pulses , or to schemes that use more than one pulse@xcite .",
    "simple theoretical models , such as the landau - zener model , were often used to explain the high yields of electronic excitation in arp@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , several schemes for population transfer with sequences of strong pulses could be designed as strong - field analogs in electronic potentials of adiabatic passage between quantum levels@xcite .",
    "adiabatic passage by light - induced potentials@xcite ( aplip ) , chirped adiabatic rapid passage@xcite ( carp ) , selective population of dressed states@xcite ( spods ) , rapid vibrational inversion via time - gating@xcite or raman chirped adiabatic passage@xcite ( rcap ) serve as examples .",
    "the lips are not only useful as a convenient explanatory device to understand the remarkable features of population transfer under strong pulses ( e.g. , its robutness ) ; they truly are potential energy surfaces that determine , for instance , the geometrical features of the molecule and their related properties . particularly interesting are lips formed by coupling a bound and a dissociative molecular potential .",
    "the effect of a strong field is to mix their electronic character .",
    "the first evidence of these properties was found out after observing bond softening in the ground electronic state@xcite and bond hardening in a dissociative potential@xcite . varying the intensity and frequency of the dressing field one",
    "can efficiently control the geometry of the  previously - dissociating  potential .",
    "however , in order to change the molecular properties , it is necessary to adiabatically prepare the system on this potential .",
    "one can then externally control the bond distance of a diatomic molecule over a very large range of values , as in the laser adiabatic manipulation of the bond ( lamb ) scheme .",
    "several two - pulse schemes and single pulses with modulated frequencies were proposed for this purpose@xcite .",
    "if the preparation is not fully adiabatic , one can still control the transition to create oscillating nuclear wave packets of different amplitudes in the lip , that is , to create molecular analogs of  classical - like  coherent vibrations@xcite .",
    "it is also possible to correct the non - adiabaticity by  absorbing  the excess of vibrational energy as a zero - energy of a modified lip , via time - asymmetric pulses@xcite .",
    "in addition to controlling the molecular geometry , other lips can be prepared to change the width of the nuclear wave packet , achieving molecular squeezing either adiabatically or dynamically@xcite .",
    "the adiabatic methods in principle can be used to create _ artificial _ bond lengths and vibrations with parameters that are fully externally controlled by the laser . however , these properties are _",
    "transient_. they only exist as long as the laser is acting and no strong measurement is performed on the system .    in correspondence to the geometrical changes induced by the lip , there are changes in the electronic properties associated to the electronic superposition state@xcite .",
    "these properties , for example the permanent or transition dipole , reflect the underlying changes in the redistribution of charges .",
    "it was recently shown that some superpositions manifested a clear classical picture of an electron oscillating between the protons , whereas in a dressed electronic state the electron was moving along with the proton@xcite .",
    "the electronic character of the lip plays important roles in other processes as well .",
    "for instance , in the control of the spin state of the molecule , we have shown how electric pulses or electromagnetic fields can be used to avoid a singlet - triplet transition , by suitably modifying the singlet and triplet lips such that there is no crossing between them@xcite . however , under usual circumstances very strong fields are needed , such that the rate of ionization at the required laser intensity is faster than the rate of inter - system conversion@xcite . under certain conditions , the schemes can only operate when the spin - orbit coupling is weak , reverting to a few - level problem@xcite",
    ".    other intramolecular or non - adiabatic couplings can be controlled in a similar manner .",
    "for instance , one can generate liacs that prevent the initial nuclear wave packet to reach a certain conical intersection in order to avoid energy deactivation@xcite .",
    "however , most works have been done to create the liac or lici in order to control the output of a photochemical process . in particular , there have been several theoretical proposals to control the yield of a photodissociation reaction@xcite , as well as the branching ratio over possible fragmentation channels@xcite and the kinetic energy distribution of the fragments@xcite . although most proposals remain experimentally untested , owing to the difficulty of finding good molecular systems where the strong field interaction is strong enough to generate lips , yet not too strong that the ionization is predominant , recent experiments have shown that indeed such control is possible@xcite .    in this work",
    "we will review some of our findings . in sec .",
    "2 we will provide a simplified analysis of the geometrical and dynamical features of lips , outlining the role of the stark - shift and of laser - induced potential energy shaping in several control scenarios . in sec .",
    "3 we present several works of our group for the control of the bond length in diatomic molecules , by using lips that imply contributions of bound and dissociative electronic states . in sec .",
    "4 we analyze the electronic character of the lips and the interesting views that it provides to control electronic properties such as the dipole moment . in sec .",
    "5 we show how one can control different observables of photodissociation reactions , such as the photodissociation spectrum , the branching ratios and the kinetic energy distribution of the fragments , by using strong nonresonant fields that couple two dissociating electronic states .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "6 provides some of the relevant conclusions .",
    "the goal of this section is to set the stage where all the subsequent control schemes reviewed in this article operate , clarifying the relation between certain topological features of the lips and the quantum processes that they convey . to simplify the analysis we start by considering diatomic molecules oriented with respect to a single external field @xmath1 .",
    "we use the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , such that @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a slowly varying envelope function , compared to the rate of change of the dynamical phase @xmath4 .",
    "the negative sign is used to describe absorption , while the positive sign is used for the stimulated emission . in general , for chirped pulses , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the time - varying frequency .",
    "if we assume that only two electronic states participate in the dynamics , the following very general effective hamiltonian can be used to describe the evolution of the nuclear wave functions in each electronic state ,    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the kinetic energy , @xmath9 takes into account non - adiabatic couplings and @xmath10 are the electronic potential energy curves .",
    "the dynamical phases in the coupling ( off - diagonal term in the hamiltonian ) are moved by a unitary transformation to the energies , showing photon - shifted potentials . in eq.(1 ) we have assumed that the field may be resonant or quasi - resonant between the two electronic states , coupled via the dipole moment @xmath11 , and nonresonant with respect to the remaining states of the molecule .",
    "the effect of the remaining states on the two selected states is described in terms of the quasi - polarizabilities ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) up to the next leading order in the field , @xmath14 .",
    "they account for the stark shifts . in principle , two very different fields ( with very different frequencies ) could be responsible for the electronic coupling and the stark - shifts .",
    "in more general scenarios , the quasi - resonant electronic transition could require multiphoton absorption instead of the single photon absorption used in eq.(1 ) .",
    "we consider now two different regimes depending on whether the effect of the laser on the potentials renders a  soft  or ",
    "hard  shaping .",
    "the first one is characterized by the lack of a resonant or quasi - resonant excitation so that the off - diagonal terms are negligible .",
    "then the initially populated lip can be written as @xmath15 in which @xmath16 is the dynamic polarizability , taking into account the effect of all the remaining states . in some cases",
    "the polarizability is dominated by a single electronic state , closer in energy to @xmath17 . in other cases ,",
    "the frequency is much smaller ( _ e.g. _ an infrared laser or an electric pulse ) and the static polarizability can be used instead . unless @xmath18 changes drastically around the equilibrium geometry of @xmath19 ( or the regions where the probability of finding the nuclear wave function are larger ) ,",
    "the topological changes in @xmath19 induced by the field will be small , hence the  soft  character of the shaping .",
    "the control is mainly exerted by @xmath3 , inducing energy variations ( stark shifts ) of the potential .",
    "it is often the case that the ground lip is very similar to the ground molecular potential .",
    "most interesting effects occur in excited lips .",
    "one first needs to move the population to an excited potential such that the events happen in @xmath20 .    on the other hand ,",
    "when the interaction is quasi - resonant , as a first approximation one can typically neglect the polarizability and concentrate on the two crossing potentials .",
    "the lips are obtained by diagonalizing the potential energy operator , including the field coupling .",
    "they are the instantaneous eingenstates of the electronic hamiltonian . applying the rotation matrix @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the rotation or mixing angle that diagonalizes the matrix , we obtain @xmath23 the off - diagonal terms in the kinetic operator , @xmath24 are often referred to as",
    "_ spatial _",
    "non - adiabatic terms , while those in the potential operator are _ dynamical _ non - adiabatic terms .",
    "they depend on the time - derivative in the mixing angle , @xmath25 , which reflects the time - variation of the field , @xmath26 .",
    "when the pulses are strong enough and their time evolution is slow enough ( in comparison with the motion of the nuclear wave functions ) the off - diagonal terms can be neglected .",
    "then , if at initial time ( when @xmath27 ) the initial potential correlates with a single lip , @xmath28 , all the dynamics will occur in this lip and the final electronic state as well as all the properties of the system during all times , will solely depend on @xmath29 . in order to characterize the lip we need to know the structure of the strongly coupled electronic potentials , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "it is most important to localize the liac , @xmath32 , defined by the condition @xmath33 the populated lip can be expressed as a function of the original molecular potentials , as @xmath34 where the mixing angle @xmath35 changes from @xmath36 to @xmath37 at both sides of the avoided crossing , @xmath32 .",
    "the first important effect that such an avoided crossing has in the lips is to completely deform the molecular potential energy curves and thus to change the structure of the molecule .",
    "for @xmath38 the lip looks like @xmath39 before the crossing and like @xmath40 after it . through the liac ,",
    "the nuclear wave packet can transfer part of the population .",
    "it operates in analogous way to a molecular ( beyond born - oppenheimer - like ) internal conversion , induced by @xmath9 . in the adiabatic limit , which requires a large energy gap between the lips in the liac and slow changes in the pulse envelope @xmath3 , the population in the initial electronic state",
    "is given by @xmath41 , while the population in the other coupled electronic state is given by @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , the motion of a nuclear wave packet across @xmath32 in @xmath43 represents full population transfer from @xmath30 to @xmath31 .",
    "we will now briefly mention some features of population transfer analyzed from the perspective of lips . as noticed , one of the most important steps in the design of laser control schemes is to localize the liac of the lip , as this topological point is an indication of possible population inversion . in order to fully transfer the population from @xmath30 to @xmath31 one",
    "needs to modulate @xmath35 via the control field @xmath3 .",
    "however , depending on the structure of the lip and the initial kinetic energy , the nuclear wave function will be able or not to cross the region of the potential that correlates with @xmath31 . in the most simple cases , as _",
    "e.g. _ in population transfer from a bound to a dissociating electronic state , a chirped pulse where the pulse frequency @xmath6 sweeps through the franck - condon region is often enough to allow the mixing angle @xmath44 to change from @xmath36 to @xmath37 for all values of @xmath45 where the wave packet is located .",
    "therefore , most lamb schemes use chirped pulses . in other cases , one needs to find a more difficult adiabatic path that connects @xmath30 to @xmath31 via the lip , requiring a more elaborate trajectory of @xmath44 .",
    "typically , when the equilibrium geometries of @xmath30 and @xmath31 are very separated and the energy gap between the lips at the liac is large , one needs to find additional electronic states that allow to modulate the lip from @xmath30 to @xmath31 adiabatically .",
    "the aplip scheme using time - delayed pulse sequences , or the carp scheme , using chirped pulses , control the population inversion to a higher excited state by means of two - photon absorption .",
    "this requires the use of more than one control pulse , therefore adding challenges to the experimental implementation of the scheme .",
    "if the population transfer is fully adiabatic , there is no internal barrier in the adiabatic pathway at the bottom of the lip connecting the initial equilibrium geometry corresponding to @xmath30 and the final equilibrium geometry corresponding to @xmath31 . under these circumstances the transfer preserves the form of the nuclear wave function . in particular , the dynamics conserves the vibrational quanta . in aplip , this is possible by using two control pulses , one called the pump pulse @xmath46 , the second one called the stokes pulse @xmath47 .",
    "for instance , consider that we want to invert the population in na@xmath48 from the ground x@xmath49 state ( @xmath30 ) to a second excited 2@xmath50 state ( @xmath31 ) , using a resonant two - photon transition through the intermediate a@xmath51 state ( @xmath52 ) , whose equilibrium geometry lies in between that of the initial and the final state ( although this is not an essential requirement for the intermediate state , it typically reduces the pulse intensities needed for the aplip scheme ) .",
    "garraway and suominen@xcite showed that a counter - intuitive pulse sequence with @xmath47 preceding @xmath46 could lead to full population inversion without populating the intermediate state at all .",
    "this is possible because such pulse sequence prepares a lip called @xmath53 , @xmath54 , that never correlates with the intermediate potential @xmath52 . also interestingly , in this lip the stark effects induced by both control pulses are minimal regardless of the pulse strength . with different properties ,",
    "other aplip pulse sequences allow full adiabatic passage@xcite .    in the following subsections we will analyze several examples of theoretically proposed schemes of control exerted via stark effect ( that is , when the coupling is far off - resonant and at least as a first approximation one can use the polarization ) , and control exerted by lip shaping ( when the coupling is resonant or quasi - resonant and one has to take into consideration substantial population transfer ) . in the latter ,",
    "the geometrical factors are obvious , as the population transfer is typically encoded in the reshaping of the lip , but the dynamics play also a very important role on the creation , passage or destruction of the lips .",
    "in this section we will review several schemes based on lips that were designed to control the bond length of diatomic molecules . in general , a molecule has different equilibrium geometries in each electronic state . typically , the bonds are more relaxed in the excited states . therefore , by electronic absorption with strong ultrashort pulses ,",
    "it is possible to transfer all the initial wave function to the excited state , creating a wave packet of vibrational eigenstates after the pulse is switched off .",
    "this vibrational wave packet oscillates around the excited - state equilibrium geometry of @xmath55 for a few periods so that the bond length of the molecule will be well defined until dispersion occurs . as the dynamics",
    "is driven by the molecular potential , there is little control over the period or amplitude of the motion .",
    "alternatively , the electronic absorption may proceed adiabatically , as in aplip .",
    "then the nuclear wave function will be slowly transferred to the equilibrium geometry of the second excited electronic state . during this process , at every intermediate time",
    "the bond length is well defined , as the wave function sits in the bottom of a single lip .",
    "the idea behind the lamb scheme is precisely to stop or freeze the transport process at the desired intermediate bond length . as long as the pulses remain constant , so will the bond length .",
    "however , the potential range for the control is much larger when the final electronic state is dissociative , since then its equilibrium geometry is at @xmath56 .",
    "hence , in principle , one can prepare the molecule at any bond length larger than the initial one .",
    "however , the adiabaticity of the process deteriorates for very large bond distances , and the dissociation probability becomes non - negligible .",
    "the first proposed implementation of lamb assumed that the initial potential @xmath30 and the intermediate potential @xmath57 , where both bound potentials , coupled via a pump pulse @xmath58 , while the target electronic state @xmath31 was dissociative , coupled to the intermediate one via @xmath59 .",
    "following one possible aplip sequence but shaping @xmath59 such that instead of switching it off , the pulse remains at a plateau amplitude @xmath60 for a certain time , it was possible to elongate the bond@xcite .",
    "more natural lamb implementations are possible when @xmath31 is coupled directly to the initial state @xmath30@xcite .",
    "fig.[lambsch ] outlines both two - pulse as well as one - pulse scenarios . in the first case",
    "the lamb process implies the following mechanism : initially @xmath59 is switched on , with an off - resonant frequency that prepares the lip @xmath20 with a liac between @xmath57 and @xmath31 at the desired bond length .",
    "then , while @xmath61 remains constant , another pulse , @xmath58 , moves all the population from @xmath30 to @xmath31 , which in the presence of @xmath60 is @xmath62 .",
    "this electronic absorption can proceed rapidly , using an ultrashort transform - limited pulse that generates a nuclear wave packet moving in the lip . in this case",
    "we talk of a vertical wave function transfer ( vwt ) . or it can be quasi - static , using a chirped pulse , in which we talk of an adiabatic transfer . in both cases",
    "full population inversion requires pulse bandwidths @xmath63 , at least as large as the absorption band , @xmath64 .",
    "in fact , in the quasi - static case , the chirp typically needs to span an even larger bandwidth .",
    "fig.[lambsch ] ( a ) and ( b ) show how the shape of @xmath62 is influenced by the choice of @xmath65 , blue - shifted or red - shifted with respect to the @xmath66 transition . in the first case there is properly a liac and the bond length in @xmath62 is better defined . in the second case",
    "there is no proper liac and the control is mostly done by stark effect . then the lip is much flatter and it is more difficult to achieve adiabatic population transfer .    on the other hand , it is possible to use a single chirped pulse , @xmath67 , responsible for both roles : the adiabatic transfer and the formation of the lip .",
    "the basic mechanism is explained in fig.[lambsch ] ( c ) and ( d ) . at initial times",
    "@xmath68 must be blue - shifted from the the absorption spectrum to the dissociative state @xmath69 .",
    "slowly sweeping through the photodissociation band the population is transferred in a quasi - static way , with the wave packet always located at the bottom of the lip .",
    "then the chirp must sweep through all the emission spectra .",
    "the final value of the frequency , @xmath70 , defines the liac and the bond length@xcite .",
    "if @xmath70 is not small enough , @xmath71 will sit at short @xmath32 . on the other hand , when @xmath72 ( where @xmath73 is the bond energy in @xmath74 ) , the liac is at infinite distance .",
    "one can therefore measure the required bandwidth scaled with respect to @xmath73 . using a single pulse ,",
    "@xmath75 must be of the order of @xmath73 .    in comparison with a vwt process",
    "a typical lamb process requires @xmath76 to @xmath77 more energy ( integrated pulse amplitude or peak amplitude times duration ) from the pulses .",
    "the extra energy is mainly used to deform the potential .",
    "this pays off in the fact that the molecular properties associated to the wave packet dynamics , is entirely governed by the field parameters .",
    "in particular , any _ trajectory _ in the `` chirp function '' @xmath6 entails different excursions of the average internuclear distance , or bond length .",
    "for instance , any time - symmetric function @xmath6 leads to fully reversible bond elongations that mimic a single period of a classical molecular vibration , with both the amplitude and frequency of the vibration being externally controlled@xcite .",

    "the exchange of kinetic energy into zero energy of the lip needs time to allow the nuclear wave function to adjust its width to the width of the potential .",

    "if @xmath6 changes faster than this characteristic period of time the process is not fully adiabatic . as fig.[lambvib ] shows , the breakdown of adiabaticity implies that the nuclear wave function receives some kinetic energy , such that the motion of the bond length depends partially on the lip equilibrium geometry determined by @xmath6 , and partially on the vibrational motion of the nuclear energy on this lip@xcite . when the chirp is reverted one prepares a highly excited vibrational wave packet in the ground potential .",
    "however , if @xmath6 varies too fast , the wave packet has little time to move from its initial position and the gained vibrational energy is small .    . in the strong adiabatic regime ( @xmath85 ) , the time - scaled bond dynamics are similar and follow the same curve . before fully adiabatic conditions ( @xmath86 ) , the dynamics is still time - symmetrical but the bond stretches more at half the pulse duration .",
    "for shorter pulses the bond dynamics is anharmonic .",
    "the wave packet gains momentum , and it is no longer attached to the bottom of the lip",

    "as the carrier frequency of the pump @xmath138 , is constant , the energy difference between the franck - condon region and the asymptotic threshold , which is fixed as @xmath182 , is smaller .",

    "in addition , using control pulses @xmath47 , the stark - shifted ked will be very broad , like the photodissociation bands shown in fig.[icl3 ] . since during the absorption @xmath47 is varying with time ,",
    "the ked comprises energies available when @xmath184 ( that is , in the absence of control pulse ) to energies available when @xmath47 is at its peak value , which are greatly red shifted .",
    "a most interesting effect is the ability to detect a similar ked in both excited electronic states in the same experiment .",
    "the previous protocol of a ps sequence that allows to control the yield of the direct photochemical reaction enables this possibility . in the results shown in this section we will use half cycle control pulses @xmath47 ( @xmath185 ) with very fast ( @xmath186 fs ) switch off times , implying the sudden change of the wave packet from @xmath187 to @xmath188 and @xmath189 , both initially opened , and the initially closed electronic channels . instead of changing the peak amplitude of @xmath142 , the control will be exerted by changing the time - delay between the pulses . using the same icl@xmath190 model introduced before , in fig.[icl3 ]",
    "we show the control exerted on both keds , which are practically identical for both products .",
    "all the keds using the ps sequence exhibit a kind of asymmetry to the red , with the low - energy tail much larger than the high - energy tail .",

    "blue - shifted asymmetries occur using the sp sequence .",
    "then the bulk of the wave packet is excited when @xmath47 is large , so that the peak of the ked is now much more red shifted .",
    "as explained in the previous section , in this case the photodissociation is selective and only one final state is observed . in the example shown in fig.[icl3 ]",
    "the peak of the ked is now close to @xmath191 ev implying a larger deviation ( @xmath192% ) of the relative speed of the fragments .",
    "we observe additional features , like the characteristic structure of interference due to excitation of the wave packet to the dissociative potential at different times  @xcite .    in very nonresonant conditions ,",
    "the manipulation of the ked relies solely on the ability to stark - shift the potential at the franck - condon region . in most cases , under reasonable pulse intensities ,",
    "the expected effect will be small , as the franck - condon window typically lies in the fast - exponential repulsive wall of the potential and can not be largely shifted in the same way that the absorption spectra can not be greatly altered .",
    "however , using resonant control pulses between @xmath30 and @xmath31 leads to a full reshaping of the lip .",
    "the key then for being able to change the asymptotic keds relies on non - adiabatically disrupting @xmath168 during the wave packet evolution through the reaction coordinate .",

    "we have illustrated these proposals with results taken from some of our contributions in the field .",
    "the experimental realization of some of these proposals is still lacking .",
    "it is typically difficult to find systems where the effect of the field is strong enough to deform the molecular potentials , yet not as strong as to completely ionize the molecule .",
    "some of the proposed schemes also rely on frequency modulation over a bandwidth larger than what is possible with currently technology .",

    "<S> a new perspective on how to manipulate molecules by means of very strong laser pulses is emerging with insights from the so - called light - induced potentials , which are the adiabatic potential energy surfaces of molecules severely distorted by the effect of the strong field . </S>",
    "<S> different effects appear depending on how the laser frequency is tuned , to a certain electronic transition , creating light - induced avoided crossings , or very off - resonant , generating stark shifts . in the former case it is possible to induce dramatic changes in the geometry and redistribution of charges in the molecule while the lasers are acting and to fully control photodissociation reactions as well as other photochemical processes . </S>",
    "<S> several theoretical proposals taken from the work of the authors are reviewed and analyzed showing the unique features that the strong - laser chemistry opens to control the transient properties and the dynamics of molecules . </S>"
