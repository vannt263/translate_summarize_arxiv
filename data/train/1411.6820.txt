    "a random tensor is a @xmath0-dimensional array of random variables .",
    "the joint probability distribution is typically chosen to be @xmath1-invariant .",
    "just like unitary invariance in random ( hermitian or complex ) matrices selects matrix traces as natural invariant observables , the invariance under @xmath1 points to a family of invariant observables , which are polynomials in the tensor entries .",
    "those observables are labeled by connected , @xmath0-regular , edge - colored graphs , and one is interested in the large @xmath2 expansion of their expectations .    in matrix models",
    "@xcite , expectations of observables @xmath3 can be expanded onto feynman graphs , actually maps whose genus is the exponent of @xmath2 in the expansion at large @xmath2 .",
    "the feynman expansion also applies to random tensors and gives rise to @xmath4-regular edge - colored graphs @xcite .",
    "each feynman graph inherits an @xmath2-dependent weight , the exponent of @xmath2 being called the _ degree _ ( which reduces to the genus at @xmath5 ) .",
    "those graphs are suited for a combinatorial analysis : the classification of colored graphs of fixed degree has been obtained in @xcite and the singularities of the generating functions are now known",
    ".    however , the calculation of expectations of invariant polynomials is still a challenging issue . even in the simplest case , i.e. the gaussian distribution , and even if one only asks for the leading order at large @xmath2 of an expectation , it is necessary to @xmath6 identify the exponent of @xmath2 for the dominant contributions , @xmath7 find the numerical coefficient which counts the number of dominant contributions ( dominant wick contractions ) .",
    "both problems are bubble - dependent .",
    "a few cases have been studied .",
    "the so - called melonic polynomials all have a single leading order wick contraction ( as well as a generalization of this family including nearly - melonic polynomials ) @xcite .",
    "a family of polynomials has been found in @xcite whose numbers of leading order wick contractions are numbers of meandric systems .",
    "it is worth emphasizing the importance of the gaussian distribution in random tensor models .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that any @xmath1-invariant distribution satisfying some assumptions on its dependence with @xmath2 becomes gaussian at large @xmath2 ( the covariance does depend on the initial distribution )  models which do not satisfy those assumptions ( and not gaussian at large @xmath2 ) are discussed in @xcite .",
    "moreover , models which do not have a trivial bare covariance , and therefore have a renormalization group flow , tend to be asymptotically free : they have a gaussian fixed point ( this happens surprisingly more often than in ordinary quantum field theory ) @xcite .",
    "it is appealing to think this somehow comes from the universality theorem of @xcite .",
    "in addition to the purely combinatorial analysis of @xcite , matrix model techniques have recently been employed in tensor models .",
    "they apply to models with quartic interactions for which the hubbard - stratanovich transformation leads to multi - matrix models @xcite . furthermore , as argued in @xcite , the behavior of generic models can then be deduced from those of the quartic ones ( universality phenomenon ) .",
    "the relationship of such multi - matrix models to ordinary matrix models has been studied in @xcite where they are described in terms of fully packed loop configurations on random surfaces generated by @xmath8 models .",
    "the results of random tensor theory were applied in this context , leading to a classification of loop configurations which corresponds to the classification of colored graphs .",
    "this basically relied on interpreting a collection of matrices as a tensor .    here",
    "we focus on the gaussian distribution instead , and use another direct connection between random tensors and matrices . splitting the set of @xmath0 indices of the tensor into two sets",
    ", we can consider the tensor as a ( typically rectangular ) matrix of size @xmath9 and then use the singular value decomposition .",
    "however , tensor models are not @xmath10 or @xmath11 invariant , meaning that the integrals over the angular degrees of freedom are non - trivial .",
    "when they can be performed at fixed singular values , an effective theory on the singular values is obtained .",
    "although it is a simple idea , it is only the first time that it is applied explicitly to tensor models . as a first step in this program ,",
    "we consider here the case of the calculation of expectations of polynomial observables in a gaussian distribution .",
    "the angular integrals are integrals of polynomials in the unitary matrix elements and the formula of @xcite can be applied . in concrete situations where the degree of the polynomial is not too large",
    ", exact results are obtained .",
    "we also show that large @xmath2 behaviors can be extracted using the diagrammatic method of @xcite on a family of observables which generalize the melonic ones ( basically , trees , like in the melonic case , formed by the gluing of matrix trace - invariants ) .",
    "in addition to providing so far unexplored relationships between random tensors and matrices , the approach of @xcite and the present paper shows the difficulties faced in random tensor theory in the familiar context of matrix models .",
    "the work presented in @xcite relied on the simple observation that a set of matrices with a unitary symmetry among them can be seen as a tensor equipped with independent unitary transformations on its indices .",
    "there is another simple way to relate tensor to matrices , which is to consider a tensor as a ( typically rectangular ) matrix between a subset of indices to the subset of the other indices . for a tensor on @xmath0 indices , seen as a linear form on @xmath12 ,",
    "one picks up a subset @xmath13 and denote its complement @xmath14 .",
    "one defines @xmath15 as a linear application from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "of course , there are multiple ways to choose @xmath18 , but depending on the observables one is interested in , some choices are better than others .",
    "we recall that a basis of observables is formed by the polynomials @xmath19 labeled by bubbles .",
    "a _ bubble _ is a connected bipartite @xmath0-regular edge - colored graph , with colors @xmath20 such that all @xmath0 colors are incident to each vertex ( see figure [ fig : necklace ] ) .",
    "the polynomial associated to a bubble is built by writing a tensor @xmath21 for each white vertex and its conjugated tensor @xmath22 for each black vertex .",
    "when an edge of color @xmath23 connects a white to a black vertex , the indices in position @xmath23 of the corresponding @xmath21 and @xmath22 are identified ( with a kronecker delta ) and summed over from @xmath24 to @xmath2 .",
    "such polynomials are invariant under @xmath1 , @xcite .",
    "loosely speaking , a `` good '' choice of the subset @xmath18 relative to @xmath19 is one that minimizes the degrees of freedom entering @xmath25 . a natural way of separating the degrees of freedom of @xmath26 is to use the singular value decomposition with respect to @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath27 , where @xmath28 are unitary and @xmath29 is made of a square diagonal matrix completed with some rows or columns of zeros . for a few families of polynomials @xmath25 , the choice of @xmath18 is obvious , e.g. when there exists one such that @xmath30 is a function of the singular values only .",
    "this last situation however requires to focus on polynomials of the form @xmath31 which we call _ necklaces_.",
    "their bubbles consist of single cycles on @xmath32 vertices connected by two types of multiple edges , those with colors in @xmath18 and those with colors in the complementary subset ( see example in figure [ fig : necklace ] ) .",
    "this is the necklace on five colors with @xmath33 and 6 vertices . ]",
    "generically , a polynomial @xmath34 depends on all the degrees of freedom of the singular value decomposition .",
    "this is simply because a polynomial invariant under the action of @xmath35 is generically not invariant under @xmath36 .",
    "notice that the gaussian measure however is independent of the angular matrices @xmath28 , i.e. @xmath37 for any choice of @xmath18",
    ". therefore the _ gaussian _ expectation of a polynomial reads @xmath38 here @xmath39 denotes the set of singular values , @xmath40 the measure inherited from the change of variables , while @xmath41 are the haar measures on unitary matrices of the appropriate sizes .    this provides a notion of effective polynomial of @xmath25 with respect to @xmath18 which is a function over the singular values , @xmath42 then , the expectation of @xmath25 is just the expectation of @xmath43 in the complex gaussian wishart ensemble ( also known as the laguerre ensemble , from the family of relevant orthogonal polynomials for this measure ) .",
    "the integral over the angular variables results in an expansion onto @xmath36-invariants , @xmath44 and therefore @xmath45    taking all the tensor indices to have range @xmath2 , the expectation of the product of single - trace invariants factorizes as the product of the expectations in the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "there are two possible cases , @xmath46 the symbol @xmath47 here also means up to some power of @xmath2 and @xmath48 is the @xmath49-th catalan number .",
    "when the matrix is rectangular , it is quite unbalanced since the ratio of its dimensions goes to either zero or infinity , and as a result a single wick contraction survives at large @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath18 ( or its complement ) is a singlet , it means that @xmath25 is a cycle of melons inserted on a fixed color and the result follows from @xcite . in the other cases ,",
    "it is an application of the results of @xcite to the gaussian distribution ( which rely on the fact that there is a melonic subgraph which visits all the vertices ) . only when @xmath15 is a square matrix one recovers the familiar catalan numbers of gaussian matrix models .",
    "several methods have been developed to deal with integrals over the unitary group , @xcite .",
    "for our purpose , since the function @xmath50 is polynomial in the matrix elements of @xmath51 , the following formula @xcite seems to be the most natural to perform the integral , @xmath52 @xmath53 and @xmath54 run over the symmetric group on @xmath55 elements @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is a weingarten function over @xmath56 .    in principle",
    ", this provides a way to compute the effective polynomial @xmath43 , and there even exists a diagrammatic expansion which enables to control the scaling with @xmath2 of the various terms involved in the sums over permutations @xcite . yet in practice , the number @xmath55 of matrix elements of @xmath58 ( and similarly for @xmath59 ) can not be too large as the sum over permutations becomes unmanageable for relatively large @xmath55 .",
    "we now set @xmath60 and @xmath61 and illustrate the method on two examples : a simple , but exact calculation , and a large @xmath2 behavior on a family of observables .",
    "we write @xmath62 where a column of tensor indices represents a index of @xmath15 with range @xmath63 .",
    "therefore @xmath64 is a @xmath65 matrix @xmath66 .",
    "if @xmath25 is a bubble in which the edges of color 2 and 4 always connect the same vertices , then the associated polynomial is a function of @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , the edges of color 2 count the degree in @xmath67 .",
    "we consider the following bubble , with @xmath68 edges of color 2 on the top and @xmath49 at the bottom of the drawing , @xmath69{bubblecatcat.pdf } \\end{array } =   \\operatorname{tr}_1 \\bigl(\\operatorname{tr}_3(mm^\\dagger)^{k}\\,\\operatorname{tr}_3(mm^\\dagger)^{l } \\bigr ) = \\sum_{a_1,a_3,b_1,b_3=1}^n ( mm^\\dagger)^{k}_{\\begin{smallmatrix } a_1\\\\ a_3\\end{smallmatrix } \\begin{smallmatrix } b_1\\\\ a_3\\end{smallmatrix}}\\ ( mm^\\dagger)^{l}_{\\begin{smallmatrix } b_1\\\\ b_3\\end{smallmatrix } \\begin{smallmatrix } a_1\\\\ b_3\\end{smallmatrix}},\\ ] ] using an obvious partial trace notation . by writing @xmath70 with @xmath71",
    ", we find @xmath72 the integral over @xmath73 is simple enough since there are only two permutations on two elements , @xmath74 only the cycle structure of the arguments of the weingarten functions is retained ( they are class functions ) , so that @xmath75 is the ( class of the ) identity and @xmath76 the ( class of the ) transposition .",
    "moreover , @xmath77 performing the sums , it comes @xmath78 which is the tensor that has to be contracted with the singular values .",
    "eventually we arrive at @xmath79    the large @xmath2 limit of the expectation can be easily extracted . normalizing the gaussian with a covariance @xmath80 , the double - trace term dominates ( each trace bringing up a factor @xmath63 ) and factorizes , so that @xmath81 ( the scaling factor @xmath82 is due to the fact that the bubble has a single cycle with colors @xmath83 and two cycles of colors @xmath84 , see @xcite . )      when the degree of the polynomial in @xmath58 ( and/or @xmath59 ) which has to be integrated is large , an exact result becomes difficult to extract and largely depend on the combinatorics of the initial bubble .",
    "even the asymptotics seems difficult to evaluate .",
    "however , in some cases , the method can lead to the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "we consider a family of observables built in the following way .",
    "we first define the _ open necklace of color @xmath23 _ as the necklace with a line of color @xmath23 cut into two halves ( see figure [ fig : opennecklace ] ) .",
    "then the construction starts with a necklace of length @xmath85 .",
    "a random edge of color 1 or 3 is deleted and instead an open necklace of the appropriate color is attached so as to get a bipartite graph . on this new graph ,",
    "a randomly chosen edge of color 1 or 3 is removed and replaced by an open necklace of the same color .",
    "the family of interest in this section consists of graphs built by continuing this process recursively a finite number of times .     on",
    "the left is a necklace and on the right an open necklace of color 1.,title=\"fig : \" ]   on the left is a necklace and on the right an open necklace of color 1.,title=\"fig : \" ]    to avoid redundancies in the construction , one can consider the rooted observables .",
    "the construction starts with an open necklace of color 1 .",
    "then the process of piling up open necklaces is similar , except that after an insertion on the color @xmath23 , further insertions on the newly created edge of this color and incident to the black vertex of the inserted open necklace are forbidden .",
    "all other edges of color 1 and 3 are called active edges .",
    "this way , there is a partial order between the open necklaces used to build up the observables .",
    "a necklace ( a child ) is smaller than another one ( a parent ) if it is inserted on an active edge of the other one .",
    "every necklace ( but the root one ) has a single parent .",
    "there is a simple bijection between the set of such rooted observables and a family of rooted , corner - labeled , plane trees .",
    "it is a generalization of the bijection between melonic graphs and trees , explained in @xcite , in the sense that the case of melonic graphs with melons on the colors 1 and 3 only will be recovered by removing the labels on the trees .",
    "the tree associated to an observable simply represents the relations of partial order between the necklaces .",
    "vertices correspond to open necklaces and edges of color 1 and 3 represent the child / parent relationships .",
    "notice that a typical necklace however has several edges of color 1 and 3 so that further decorations are required to keep track of the specific edges on which insertions are performed .",
    "one defines the distance between two edges incident to the same vertex and both connected to children of this vertex as the number of edges of color 2 which separate the two insertions on the necklace corresponding to this vertex .",
    "the distance at a vertex @xmath86 between an edge connected to a children of this vertex and an edge connected to the parent of @xmath86 is the number of edges of color 2 around the necklace corresponding to @xmath86 between the edge incident to a black vertex which goes to the parent necklace and the edge on which the insertion of the children necklace is performed . in the tree , those distances",
    "are included by preserving the cyclic ordering of the insertions around each vertex , so that they label the corners .",
    "an example is given in figure [ fig : treevertex ] .",
    "this represents a typical necklace within an observable , which is mapped to a vertex of the corresponding tree .",
    "if we assume the edge connected to the parent is the open one incident to the black vertex and of color 1 on the left , then the distances labeling the corners ( going counter - clockwise ) read 3 , 2 , 0 , 1 , 3 , 0 .",
    "the final 0 is only here when there is a necklace insertion on the open edge of color 1 on the left , incident to the white vertex . ]",
    "the bubble considered in the equation is represented by the tree with two vertices and a single edge of color 1 between them .",
    "it has two corners , one with label @xmath68 and one with label @xmath49 .",

    "then @xmath93    to prove this , we will show that the removal of a leaf with label @xmath49 and its incident edge in the tree amounts to factorizing the catalan number @xmath48 .",

    "we would like to eventually mention a more speculatively related idea . the same way the schwinger - dyson equations of ordinary matrix models constitute a set of virasoro constraints , those of tensor models can be cast as a set of constraints generated by operators which form a lie algebra @xcite .",
