    "the interaction between intense laser beams and plasmas leads to a variety of different instabilities , including brillouin and raman forward and backward @xcite scattering and modulational instabilities . in multiple dimensions we also have filamentation and side - scattering instabilities .",
    "relativistic effects can then play an important role @xcite .",
    "when two laser beams interact in the plasma , we have a new set of phenomena .",
    "an interesting application is the beat - wave accelerator , in which two crossing beams with somewhat different frequencies can accelerate electrons to ultra - relativistic speeds via the ponderomotive force acting on the electrons .",
    "the modulational and filamentation instabilities of multiple co - propagating electromagnetic waves can be described by a system of coupled nonlinear schrdinger equations from which the nonlinear wave coupling and the interaction between localized light wave packets can be easily studied @xcite .",
    "two co - propagating narrow laser beams may attract each other and spiral around each other @xcite or merge @xcite .",
    "counter - propagating laser beams detuned by twice the plasma frequency can , at relativistic intensities , give rise to fast plasma waves via higher - order nonlinearities @xcite . at relativistic amplitudes ,",
    "plasma waves can also be excited via beat wave excitation at frequencies different from the electron plasma frequency , with applications to efficient wake - field accelerators @xcite .",
    "the relativistic wakefield behind intense laser pulses is periodic in one - dimension @xcite and shows a quasi - periodic behavior in multi - dimensional simulations @xcite .",
    "particle - in - cell simulations have demonstrated the generation of large - amplitude plasma wake - fields by colliding laser pulses @xcite or by two co - propagating pulses where a long trailing pulse is modulated efficiently by the periodic plasma wake behind the first short pulse @xcite .    in the present paper , we consider the nonlinear interaction between two weakly relativistic crossing laser beams in plasmas .",
    "we derive a set of nonlinear mode coupled equations and nonlinear dispersion relations , which we analyze for raman backward and forward scattering instabilities as well as for brillouin and modulation / self - focusing instabilities .",
    "we consider the propagation of intense laser light in an electron  ion plasma .",
    "the slowly varying electron density perturbation is denoted by @xmath0 .",
    "thus , our starting point is the maxwell equation @xmath1 the laser field is given in the radiation gauge , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . since @xmath4 , we thus have @xmath5",
    ". moreover , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the electron rest mass and @xmath8 is the relativistic gamma factor , so that @xmath9 for weakly relativistic particles , i.e.  @xmath10 , we can approximate ( [ eq : e - vel ] ) by @xmath11 with these prerequisites , eq .",
    "( [ eq : evol ] ) becomes @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the electron plasma frequency and we have denoted @xmath14 .",
    "next , we divide the vector potential into two parts according to @xmath15 , representing the two laser pulses .",
    "we also consider the case @xmath16 . with this",
    ", we obtain from ( [ eq : nlin ] ) the two coupled equations    @xmath17    and @xmath18 [ eq : nlin - coupled ]    assuming that @xmath19 is proportional to @xmath20 where @xmath21 , we obtain in the slowly varying envelope approximation two coupled nonlinear schrdinger equations    @xmath22    and @xmath23 [ eq : nlse - coupled ]    where @xmath24 is the group velocity and @xmath25 is the electromagnetic wave frequency .    in order to close ( [ eq :",
    "nlse - coupled ] ) , we next consider the slow plasma response . here",
    "we may follow two routes .",
    "first , if we assume immobile ions , the slowly varying electron number density and velocity perturbations satisfy the equations @xmath26 and @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the electron temperature , together with the poisson equation @xmath29 thus , combining ( [ eq7])([eq9 ] ) together with the vector potential decomposition , we obtain @xmath30 where the electron thermal velocity is denoted by @xmath31 .",
    "second , if the electrons are treated as inertialess , we have in the quasi - neutral limit @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath34 adding eqs .",
    "( [ eq : inless1 ] ) and ( [ eq : inless2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath35 which should be combined with @xmath36 to obtain @xmath37 where the sound speed is @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the ion temperature .",
    "we shall consider , successively , eqs .",
    "( 6a , b ) combined with ( [ eq : acoustic1 ] ) ( case i : raman scattering ) or with ( [ eq : acoustic2 ] ) ( case ii : brillouin scattering ) .      setting @xmath40 and @xmath41 into the equations for the plasma density responses ,",
    "we obtain @xmath42 where ,    for case i : @xmath43 and for case ii : @xmath44 [ alpha0 ]    the expressions ( [ response ] ) and ( [ alpha0 ] ) derived above provide the slow plasma response for any given pair of fields @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the latter now obey a set of coupled equations , which are obtained by substituting ( [ response ] ) into ( [ eq : nlse - coupled ] ) ,    @xmath47    and @xmath48 [ cnlse1 ]    for convenience , eqs .",
    "( [ cnlse1]a ) and ( [ cnlse1]b ) are cast into the reduced form as    @xmath49 has been normalized by @xmath50 and where the nonlinearity / coupling coefficients are    @xmath51    and @xmath52 [ qcoeff ]    for stimulated raman ( case i ) and brillouin ( case ii ) scattering , respectively .",
    "we observe that the expressions ( [ qcoeff]a ) and ( [ qcoeff]b ) may be either positive or negative , depending on the frequency @xmath53 , prescribing either the modulational instability or the raman and brillouin scattering instabilities @xcite .",
    "the two nonlinear wave equations are identical upon an index ( @xmath54 ) interchange , and coincide for equal frequencies @xmath55 .",
    "we now investigate the parametric instabilities of the system of equations ( [ red1 ] ) and ( [ red2 ] ) .",

    "for the nonlinear wave couplings , we have from ( [ cnlse ] ) the system of equations    @xmath63    [ nonlinsys ]    where the unknowns are @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "the sidebands are characterized by @xmath68-c^2k^2,\\ ] ] where we have used @xmath69 .",
    "the solution of the system of equations ( [ nonlinsys ] ) yields the nonlinear dispersion relation @xmath70 which relates the complex - valued frequency @xmath53 to the wavenumber @xmath71 .",
    "equation ( [ nonlindisp ] ) covers raman forward and backscattering instabilities , as well as the brillouin backscattering instability or the modulational / self - focusing instability , depending on the two expressions for the coupling constant @xmath61 .",
    "if either @xmath72 or @xmath73 is zero , then we recover the usual expressions for a single laser beam in a laboratory plasma , or for a high - frequency radio beam in the ionosphere @xcite .",
    "we have solved the nonlinear dispersion relation ( [ nonlindisp ] ) and presented the numerical results in figs . 15 . in all cases ,",
    "we have used the normalized weakly relativistic pump wave amplitudes @xmath74 with different sets of wavenumbers for the two beams .",
    "the nonlinear couplings between the laser beams and the langmuir waves , giving rise to the raman scattering instabilities ( case i ) , are considered in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "the instability essentially obeys the matching conditions @xmath75 and @xmath76 , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the frequency and wavenumbers of the pump wave , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the frequency and wavenumbers for the scattered and frequency downshifted electromagnetic daughter wave , @xmath53 and @xmath81 are the frequencies of the langmuir waves , and where the light waves approximately obey the linear dispersion relation , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and the low - frequency waves obey the langmuir dispersion relation @xmath84 .",
    "we thus have the matching condition @xmath85^{1/2}+(\\omega_{p0}^2 + 3 k^2 v_{te}^2)^{1/2}$ ] , which in two - dimensions relates the components @xmath86 and @xmath87 of the langmuir waves to each other , and which gives rise to almost circular regions of instability , as seen in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "in the upper left and right panels of fig . 1 , we have assumed that the single beams @xmath88 and @xmath89 propagate in the @xmath90 and @xmath91 direction , respectively , having the wavenumber @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "we can clearly see a backward raman instability , which for the beams @xmath88 and @xmath89 have maximum growth rates at @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "the backward raman instability is connected via the obliquely growing wave modes to the forward raman scattering instability that has a maximum growth rate ( much smaller than that of the backward raman scattering instability ) at the wave number @xmath96 in the same directions as the laser beams . in the lower panels ,",
    "we consider the two beams propagating simultaneously in the plasma , at a right angle to each other ( lower left panel ) and in opposite directions ( lower right panel ) .",
    "we see that the dispersion relation predicts a rather weak interaction between the two laser beams , where the lower left panel shows more or less a superposition of the growth rates in the two upper panels .",
    "the case of two counter - propagating laser beams ( lower right panel ) also shows a weak interaction between the two beams . for the case of equal wavelengths of the two pump waves , as shown in fig .",
    "2 , we have a similar scenario as in fig .",
    "1 . the lower left panel of fig .",
    "2 shows that the growth rate of two interacting laser beams propagating at a right angle to each other is almost a superposition of the growth rates of the single laser beams displayed in the upper panels of fig .",
    "2 . only for the counter - propagating laser beams in the lower right panel",
    "we see that the instability regions have split into broader and narrower bands of instability , while the magnitude of the instability is the same as for the single beam cases .",
    "we next turn to the brillouin scattering scenario ( case ii ) , in which the laser wave is scattered against ion acoustic waves , displayed in figs . 3 and 4 .",
    "in the weakly nonlinear case , we have three - wave couplings in the same manner as for the interaction with langmuir waves , and we see in both figs . 3 and 4 that the instability has a maximum growth rate in a narrow , almost circular band in the @xmath97 plane .",
    "in the upper two panels , we also see the backscattered brillouin instability with a maximum growth rate at approximately twice the pump wavenumbers , but we do not have the forward scattered instability .",
    "instead , we see a broadband weak instability in all directions and also perpendicular to the pump wavenumbers .",
    "a careful study shows that the perpendicular waves are purely growing , i.e. there may be density channels created along the propagation direction of the laser beam . in the lower panels of figs . 3 and 4",
    ", we display the cases with interacting laser beams .",
    "also in the case of brillouin scattering , the nonlinear dispersion relation predicts a rather weak interaction between the two beams , where the instability regions of the two beams are more or less superimposed without dramatic differences in the growth rates .    in order to investigate the nonlinear dynamics of the interacting laser beams in plasmas , we have carried out numerical simulations of the reduced system of equations ( [ eq : nlse - coupled ] ) in two spatial dimensions , and have presented the results in figs .",
    "58 . in these simulations",
    ", we have used as an initial condition that either @xmath88 has a constant amplitude of @xmath98 and @xmath89 has a zero amplitude , or that both beams have a constant amplitude of @xmath98 and that they initially have group velocities at a right angle to each other . due to symmetry reasons ,",
    "it is sufficient to simulate one vector component of @xmath99 , which we will denote @xmath19 ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "the background plasma density is slightly perturbed with a low - level noise ( random numbers ) .",
    "we first consider stimulated raman scattering , displayed in figs . 5 and 6 . the single beam case in fig .",
    "5 shows a growth of density waves mainly in the direction of the beam , while a standing wave pattern is created in the amplitude of the electromagnetic wave envelope , where maxima in the laser beam amplitude is ( roughly ) correlated with minima in the electron density .",
    "this is in line with the standard raman backscattering instability .",
    "the simulation is ended when the plasma density fluctuations are large and self - nonlinearities and kinetic effects are likely to become important . in fig .",
    "6 , we show the case with the two beams crossing each other at a right angle . in this case",
    ", the wave pattern becomes slightly more complicated with local maxima of the laser beam envelope amplitude correlated with local minima of the electron density .",
    "however , this pattern is very regular and there is no clear sign of nonlinear structures in the numerical solution .",
    "we next turn to the case of stimulated brillouin scattering , presented in figs .",
    "7 and 8 . in this case",
    ", the waves grow not only in the direction of the laser beam but also , with almost the same growth rate , obliquely to the propagation direction of the laser beam .",
    "we see in the single beam case , presented in fig .",
    "7 , that the envelope of the ion beam becomes modulated in localized areas both in @xmath90 and @xmath91 directions , and in the nonlinear phase at the end of the simulation , the laser beam envelope has local maxima correlated with local minima of the ion density",
    ". for the case of two crossed laser beams , displayed in fig .",
    "8 , we see a more irregular structure of the instability and that at the final stage , local `` hot spots '' are created in which large amplitude laser beam envelopes are correlated with local depletions of the ion density .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the instability and dynamics of two nonlinearly interacting intense laser beams in an unmagnetized plasma .",
    "our analytical and numerical results reveal that stimulated raman forward and backward scattering instabilities are the dominating nonlinear processes that determine the stability of intense laser beams in plasmas , where relativistic mass increases and the radiation pressure effects play a dominant role .",
    "our nonlinear dispersion relation for two interacting laser beams with different wavenumbers predicts a superposition of the instabilities for the single beams . the numerical simulation of the coupled nonlinear schrdinger equations for the laser beams and the governing equations for the slow plasma density perturbations in the presence of the radiation pressures , reveal that in the case of stimulated raman scattering , the nonlinear interaction between the two beams is weaker than for the case of stimulated brillouin scattering .",
    "the latter case lead to local density cavities correlated with maxima in the electromagnetic wave envelope .",
    "the present results should be useful for understanding the nonlinear propagation of two nonlinearly interacting laser beams in plasmas , as well as for the acceleration of electrons by high gradient electrostatic fields that are created due to stimulated raman scattering instabilities in laser - plasma interactions .",
