    "without double beta decay there can be no solution of the nature of the neutrino ( dirac or majorana particle ) and of the structure of the neutrino mass matrix . only investigation of @xmath2 oscillations _ and _ double beta decay together can lead to an absolute mass scale .    concerning the search for cold dark matter",
    ", even a discovery of susy by lhc will not have proven that neutralinos form indeed the cold dark matter in the universe . direct detection of the latter by underground detectors remains indispensable . concerning solar neutrino physics , present",
    "information on possible @xmath2 oscillations relies on 0.2@xmath3 of the solar neutrino flux .",
    "the total pp neutrino flux has not been measured and also no real - time information is available for the latter .",
    "the genius project proposed in 1997 ( see @xcite ) as the first third generation @xmath4 detector , could attack all of these problems with an unpredented sensitivity .",
    "among present double beta experiments the the most sensitive experiment is _ since eight years _ the heidelberg - moscow experiment using the world s largest source strength of 11 kg of 86@xmath3 enriched @xmath5 in form of 5 high - purity ge detectors , run in the gran sasso underground laboratory .",
    "this experiment yields after 53.9 ( 35.5)kgy of measurement a half - life limit of @xmath6 @xmath7 , ( 90@xmath3 c.l . ) and an upper limit for the effective neutrino mass @xmath8 of 0.42(0.35)ev @xcite .",
    "the numbers in parentheses are deduced from psa .",
    "these numbers are just entering into the range of expectations for @xmath9 from neutrino oscillation experiments ( see fig.[sum - difschemneutr ] ) .",
    "new approaches and considerably enlarged experiments ( as discussed , e.g. in @xcite ) are required , however , to improve the present accuracy .",
    "this can not be done by any of the presently operated double beta experiments , whose status is shown in fig.[status ] , together with the potential of some future projects under discussion .    with the era of the heidelberg - moscow experiment",
    "the time of the small smart experiments is over .",
    "table[key - exper ] lists some key numbers for genius , and of the main other proposals made after the genius proposal .",
    "not all of these proposals fully cover the region to be probed .",
    "since it was realized in the heidelberg - moscow experiment , that the remaining small background is coming from the material close to the detector ( holder , copper cap , ... ) , elimination of _ any _ material close to the detector will be decisive .",
    "experiments which do not take this into account , like , e.g. cuore and majorana , will allow only rather limited steps in sensitivity .",
    "another crucial point is the energy resolution , which can be optimized _ only _ in experiments using germanium detectors or bolometers",
    ". it will be difficult to probe evidence for this rare decay mode in experiments , which have to work - as result of their limited resolution - with energy windows around q@xmath10 of several hundred kev , such as nemo iii , exo . in the first proposal for a third generation double beta experiment , the genius proposal @xcite",
    ", the idea is to use naked germanium detectors in a huge tank of liquid nitrogen .",
    "it has been shown that the detectors show excellent performance under such conditions @xcite .",
    "genius seems to be at present the _ only _ proposal , which can fulfill _ both _ requirements mentioned above .",
    "the potential of genius is together with that of some later proposals indicated in fig .",
    "[ sum - difschemneutr ] .",
    "for technical questions and extensive monte carlo simulations of the genius project for its various applications we refer to @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +",
    "genius will also allow the access to a broad range of other beyond sm physics topics in the multi - tev range .",
    "already now @xmath4 decay probes the tev scale on which new physics should manifest itself ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . basing to a large extent on the theoretical work of the heidelberg group in the last six years , the heidelberg - moscow experiment yields results for susy models ( r - parity breaking , sneutrino mass ) , leptoquarks ( leptoquarks - higgs coupling ) , compositeness , right - handed w mass , nonconservation of lorentz invariance and equivalence principle , mass of a heavy left or righthanded neutrino , competitive to corresponding results from high - energy accelerators like tevatron and hera",
    ". the potential of genius could extend into the multi - tev region for these fields and its sensitivity would correspond to that of lhc or nlc and beyond ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "genius would in a first step , with 100 kg of _ natural _ ge detectors , and in three years measurring time , cover a significant part of the mssm parameter space for prediction of neutralinos as cold dark matter ( fig.[fig : bedn - wp2000 ] ) . for this purpose",
    "the background in the energy range @xmath11100kev has to be reduced to @xmath12events / kgykev , which is possible if the detectors are produced and handled on earth surface under heavy shielding , to reduce the cosmogenic background produced by spallation through cosmic radiation to a minimum . for details",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig : bedn - wp2000 ] shows together with the expected sensitivity of genius predictions for neutralinos as dark matter by two models , one basing on supergravity @xcite , the other on the mssm , with more relaxed unification conditions @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of genius for dark matter with 100 kg of natural germanium is better than that obtainable with a 1@xmath13 amanda detector for _ indirect _ detection ( neutrinos from neutralino annihilation at the sun ) .",
    "interestingly both experiments would probe different neutralino compositions : genius mainly gaugino - dominated neutralinos , amanda mainly neutralinos with comparable gaugino and higgsino components .",
    "it should be emphasized that , together with dama , genius will be the _ only _ future dark matter experiment , which would be able to positively identify a dark matter signal by the seasonal modulation signature .",
    "this _ can not _",
    "be achieved , for example , by the cdms experiment .",
    "no experiment has separately measured the pp and @xmath1 neutrinos and no experiment has measured the _ full _ pp @xmath2 flux .",
    "borexino plans to measure @xmath1 neutrinos , the access to pp neutrinos being limited by @xmath14 contamination ( the usual problem of organic scintillators ) .",
    "genius could be the first detector measuring the _ full _ pp ( and @xmath1 ) neutrino flux in real time .    with a radius of genius of 13 m and improving some of the shielding parameters",
    "as described in @xcite the background can be reduced to a level of @xmath15 events / kgykev ( fig.[backgr - sol ] ) .",
    "this will allow to look for the pp and @xmath1 solar neutrinos by elastic neutrino - electron scattering with a threshold    of 11kev or at most 19kev ( limit of possible tritium background ) ( fig.[sol - spectr ] ) , which would be the lowest threshold among other proposals to detect pp neutrinos , such as heron , hellaz , neon , lens , moon , xmass .",
    "the counting rate of genius ( 10ton ) would be 6 events per day for pp and 18 per day for @xmath1 neutrinos , i.e. similar to borexino , but by a factor of 30 to 60 larger than a 20ton lens detector and a factor of 10 larger than the moon detector .",
    "construction of a test facility for genius - genius - tf - consisting of @xmath16 40 kg of hp ge detectors suspended in a liquid nitrogen box has been started . up",
    "to middle of 2001 , six detectors each of @xmath16 2.5 kg and with a threshold of as low as @xmath16 500ev have been produced .    besides test of various parameters of the genius project , the test facility would allow , with the projected background of 2 - 4events / kgykev in the low - energy range , to probe the dama evidence for dark matter by the seasonal modulation signature ( fig . [",
    "fig : upper - gen - tf ] ) .",
    "for details we refer to @xcite .",
    "the genius project is - among the projected or discussed third generation double beta detectors - the one which may exploit this method to push the sensitivity on the neutrino mass to the ultimate limit .",
