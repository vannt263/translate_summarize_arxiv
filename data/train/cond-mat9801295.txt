    "common observations suggest that flat sand surfaces can become unstable when subjected to moving air or water . after some time regular patterns appear , as can be observed on desert dunes , underwater sand , ` dry ' snow , etc .",
    "these patterns resemble surface waves ; however their physics is completely different since in the case of sand there is no surface tension .",
    "following bagnold ( @xcite , chap .",
    "11 ) these patterns can be classified into ripples , ridges and dunes .",
    "the repetition distance of ridges varies with time , whereas ripples exhibit a stationary wavelength after some transient .",
    "early qualitative arguments by bagnold @xcite suggested that the ripple wavelength @xmath0 is related to the typical path length of the blown grains , called the ` saltation length ' @xmath1 .",
    "a more quantitative ` two - species ' model was proposed by anderson @xcite , which describes the coupling between the moving grains and the static bed .",
    "such a model predicts that a flat surface is unstable for all wavelengths , with a faster growing mode indeed comparable to the typical jump length of the grains .",
    "however , this model is incomplete : while the dynamics of the static bed is treated exactly , the description of the moving phase is highly simplified .",
    "alternatively , there are also several numerical models for ripple formation @xcite . in this paper , we extend anderson s theoretical model of ripple formation , by adapting the phenomenological equations for surface flow introduced in @xcite in the context of avalanches , and further discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is worth recalling , after bagnold @xcite , some basic facts about the motion of the grains and the formation of these patterns : ( i ) there are two qualitatively distinct transport mechanisms for the grains , saltation and surface creep .",
    "the trajectories of grains in saltation is determined by the velocity profile of the wind , the air friction limiting the grain velocity and by the initial energy of the grain when first expelled from the sand bed .",
    "one of the characteristic features of the path is the flat angle of incidence which varies between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "( ii ) the saltation has two effects on the surface : it either rebounds and/or ejects grains leading to a new saltation or it produces surface creep .",
    "there is however no sharp boundary between these two processes , since the energy of the ejected grains varies continuously .",
    "both saltation and creep lead to a net flow of grains in the direction of the wind .",
    "( iii ) the time scale of ripple formation is much larger than that of saltation .",
    "( iv ) the migration velocity of the ripples is much smaller than a mean transport velocity ( averaged over saltation and creep ) .",
    "the phenomenological approach we consider in the following is based on the observation that two different species of grains enter the problem : moving grains and grains at rest .",
    "we will not distinguish between grains in saltation and creep , but introduce an appropriately averaged quantity describing grains that are convected by either of the two mechanisms , which we call the moving grain density @xmath4 , which depends on the instantaneous velocity of the grains .",
    "@xmath4 is the average of @xmath5 over all velocities . ] where @xmath6 is the coordinate in the direction of the wind and @xmath7 the time .",
    "( we will assume that the problem is translationally invariant in the direction transverse to the wind ; see @xcite for an extension to two dimensions ) .",
    "the grains at rest contribute to the local height @xmath8 of the static bed .",
    "the dynamical equations for @xmath9 and @xmath10 read , in the hydrodynamical ( long wavelength ) limit : @xmath11\\nonumber\\\\ \\del_t h&=&-\\gamma[r , h]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the average velocity of the grains and the dispersion constant , related to the fact that grains do not all move with the same velocity .. ] @xmath14 describes the rate with which a grain at rest is converted into a moving grain ( or vice versa ) and depends both on @xmath9 and on the local surface profile . for simplicity",
    "we have defined @xmath9 to have the same dimension as @xmath10 , and it can be thought of as the width of grains which has been removed from the static bed .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath14 has the dimension of a velocity .",
    "the construction of @xmath14 is based on phenomenological arguments @xcite , and encodes different physical processes :    @xmath15 due to the presence of wind , grains can be ` spontaneously ' ejected from the surface , even in the absence of already moving grains .",
    "the rate at which this occurs depends on the local wind velocity ( or rather velocity gradient at the surface ) .",
    "since the wind velocity tends to be larger when the local slope is facing the wind , we write : _ sp = _ 0+_1_xh-_2_x^2h where the coefficients @xmath16 are positive or zero .",
    "we have also included the second derivative contribution with a minus sign , since grains are harder to dislodge in troughs than at the top of a crest .",
    "note that all these coefficients are expected to depend on the external wind velocity .",
    "in particular , as shown by bagnold himself , the coefficient @xmath17 is only non - zero above a certain critical wind velocity , noted @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath15 when hitting the ground , a moving grain can either be captured or transfer a part of its kinetic energy to other static grains and provide new moving particles .",
    "the rate at which both these process occur is proportional to @xmath9 ( at least for small enough @xmath9  see below ) , and also depends on the wind velocity and on the local slope .",
    "for example , flying grains have a larger probability to land on a surface facing the wind , rather than in the wind shadow .",
    "this suggests to write the _ stimulated _ conversion rate as : _",
    "=- r[_0+_1_x h+_2_x^2h ] the sign of @xmath19 depends on the strength of the wind ; for small wind velocity , one expects capture to be more important than emission , and thus that @xmath20 .",
    "as again shown by bagnold , a localized source of moving grains tends to die away when the wind velocity is less than a certain @xmath21 , whereas a steady saltation is found for larger velocities , suggesting that @xmath22 for @xmath23 . in this case , however , it is easy to see that @xmath9 increases exponentially , and that higher order terms are needed to describe the stationary situation .",
    "one can think of several non - linear effects : for example , collision between flying grains leads to dissipation and hence to a poorer efficiency of the impacts on the static bed .",
    "also , the presence of a layer of moving grains screens the hydrodynamical flow , which in turn reduces the energy transfer between the wind and the saltating grains .",
    "these effects can be described by a term proportionnal to @xmath24 in @xmath25 .",
    "on @xmath9 should also be taken into account .",
    "we do not consider this here , since this does not affect the linear instability analysis . ]",
    "if trapping dominates ( as is the case for under water ripples ) one expects @xmath26 because more grains fall on the slope facing the convective flow .",
    "for the same reason , if stimulated emission dominates , as is the case for wind blown sand , one expects that @xmath27 .",
    "finally , @xmath28 is positive since , again , grains are easier to dislodge at the top of a bump .",
    "the total conversion rate @xmath14 is obtained as the sum of @xmath29 and @xmath25 , while the model proposed in @xcite did not contain the wind induced contribution proportionnal to @xmath16 , nor the non - linear term .",
    "the equation for @xmath10 thus reads : _ t h = ( r _ 0 - _ 0 ) + r^2 + ( r _ 1 - _ 1 ) _ x h + ( r _ 2 + _ 2)_x^2h the gradient term can be interpreted as a translation of the surface profile with time , at velocity @xmath30 .",
    "the direct action of the wind ( @xmath31 ) is indeed to erode grains from the windward slope of a bump and transport them in the direction of the wind .",
    "the other contribution ( @xmath32 ) , however , moves the bumps ` backwards ' since grains are effectively deposited on the windward slope , contributing to a translation of the bump against the wind .",
    "( a similar discussion can be found in @xcite . )",
    "note that the above set of equations is non - linear , so that non - trivial dynamics is expected .",
    "some essential features of the model can be investigated by linearizing the system in the vicinity of the situation where the surface is flat ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the moving grain density is then equal to ( see fig 1 ) : r_0= .",
    "we will perform a stability analysis , i.e. investigate whether a small perturbation is amplified or dies out with time .",
    "therefore we consider @xmath34 , @xmath35 and neglect second order terms of the kind @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "for simplicity of notation we drop the bars ; the linearized equations then read @xmath39 with an effective velocity @xmath40 and an effective diffusion constant @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 is equal to @xmath43 and is thus always _",
    "positive_. a fourier analysis of the linearized equations leads to (    cc -i-_0-ikv - k^2d_1&ikw+k^2d_2 + _ 0&-i - ikw - k^2d_2 +    ) (    cc +   +    ) = 0 where the tilde denotes the fourier transforms .",
    "this system has a non - trivial solution if the determinant of the above matrix is zero , leading to the relation [ wq ] ^2+(a+ib)+(c+id)=0 .",
    "the coefficients read @xmath44\\nonumber\\\\ c&=&vwk^2-d_1d_2k^4\\nonumber\\\\ d&=&-(d_1w+d_2v)k^3;\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] they are functions of the wave vector @xmath45 and of the system s parameters ( @xmath12 , @xmath46 , @xmath13 , @xmath47 , @xmath42 ) .    equation ( [ wq ] ) establishes a dispersion relation @xmath48 with two branches corresponding to the two solutions of the quadratic equation , where @xmath49 has to be considered as a complex variable . (",
    "writing down the corresponding equations for the real and the imaginary part of @xmath49 leads to quartic equations . ) in the context of a stability analysis we are interested in the imaginary part of @xmath48 : as long as it is positive @xmath50 will decay exponentially , while a negative imaginary part does lead to an instability .",
    "this imaginary part is given by : @xmath51^{1/2 } \\right]^{1/2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is a function of @xmath45 .",
    "a critical wave vector @xmath52 can be defined such that im(@xmath49 ) is exactly zero , which leads to @xmath53 .",
    "inserting the explicit expressions ( [ abcd ] ) , one finds a cubic equation for @xmath54 .",
    "whenever this equation admits a positive solution , there will be a finite band of wave vectors @xmath55 $ ] which are unstable ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "it is instructive to study the asymptotic behaviour of the functions @xmath56 .",
    "one finds : ( _-)=. with @xmath57 . the transport velocity @xmath12 ( by convention ) and",
    "the diffusion constants are positive ; the main control parameter remaining is the relative migration velocity @xmath58 .",
    "one sees that for @xmath59 there is indeed a band of instable wave vectors ( one can see from the asymptotic solutions that the sign changes for large @xmath45 s ) .",
    "the situation where @xmath60 is stable and @xmath61 ( i.e. a bump moving faster than the transport velocity ) does not seem physical . the second branch im@xmath62 is always positive and is thus of no importance for our stability considerations .",
    "following the intuition that the ripples move much more slowly than the grains are transported , we will assume in the sequel that @xmath63 , which we attribute to the fact that the @xmath64 coefficients are small compared to @xmath12 . since @xmath65 , this suggests that the diffusion constants @xmath13 and @xmath47 are in the same ratio , so we write : @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is of the order of one .",
    "these assumptions make it possible to simplify the algebra and to find the solution : [ wapp ] im(_-)=+o(^2 ) . which is plotted in figure 2 .",
    "as we discuss now , three relevant facts can be verified with this formula : ( i ) the critical wave vector is of the order of the inverse mean saltation length , ( ii ) the ripple velocity is of the order of @xmath68 and ( iii ) the time scale of ripple formation is much larger than the saltation time scale .",
    "let us first give some arguments for ( i ) .",
    "since the saltation trajectories result from some random initial vertical velocity of the grains , the saltation lengths will also be random , with both short jumps ( actually corresponding to creep ) and long jumps .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the width of the saltation length distribution is of the same order as its mean @xmath1 ( a similar assumption is discussed in @xcite ) . in this situation , the ` pclet",
    "' number defined as @xmath69 is of order one : convective and diffusive effects are of the same order of magnitude . in the case where the jump length distribution is sharply peaked around @xmath1",
    ", one would rather have @xmath70 .    defining @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the typical saltation time",
    ", one finds that the the zero of ( [ wapp ] ) is located at : k_*^2=pe2 ^ 2 \\{-(pe+_0 ) } since @xmath42 is the ( renormalized ) rate of sticking , it is reasonnable to assume that @xmath73 , thereby confirming that @xmath74 for @xmath75 . on the other hand , for weakly dissipative collisions ( hard grains )",
    "one expects that @xmath76 , leading to larger unstable wavelengths @xmath77 .",
    "the ripple velocity is given by the corresponding dispersion relation , i.e. the real part of @xmath48 .",
    "one finds : 2re(_-)=+o(^2 ) .",
    "the formula shows that for @xmath78 , both phase and group velocities are indeed of the order of @xmath68 , establishing thus ( ii ) .    finally knowing the fastest growing wave vector",
    ", one finds that the ripple formation time @xmath79 ( determined by the depth of the minimum in figure 2 ) is a factor @xmath80 larger than say @xmath81 or @xmath72 , i.e. that ripple formation occurs on much slower time scales than any microscopic process .",
    "the ratio of formation time and microscopic time scales should indeed be roughly the same as that between migration and convection velocity ( iii ) .",
    "let us finally give an intuitive interpretation of the instability .",
    "imagine a flat surface with a finite number of moving grains above it ( i.e. the stationary solution ) .",
    "now imagine a small perturbation of this situation , say a small hump .",
    "the term @xmath82 in the linearized equations ( [ lin ] ) increases locally the concentration of the moving grains thus producing a ` cloud ' at the windward side of the hump .",
    "this cloud is convected with the velocity @xmath12and after a time unit of @xmath81 the cloud has moved a distance @xmath1 where the cloud starts to ` rain ' ( i.e. moving grains are converted into grains at rest ) .",
    "if the position of the hump has in the same time moved in the same direction , its height will increase , leading to an instability .",
    "( conversely , if the bump moves backward  i.e. if @xmath83  the ` rain ' will rather fill the hole and smear out the bump ) .",
    "the presence of the diffusive processes counterbalances the amplification for small distances and some optimum wavelength of the order of @xmath1 ( corresponding with the minimum in figure 2 ) becomes visible .    summarizing",
    ", we have thus shown that equations ( 1 ) , which are phenomenological , but motivated by clear physical processes , indeed show an instability which is consistent with some essential features of ripple formation .",
    "it is worth noting that our analysis , which concentrated on the linearized system in the vicinity of the stationary solution , is universal in the sense that a whole class of models behaves in an analogous way ( with some possible redefinition of the coefficients ) .",
    "for example , a non - linear dependence of the velocity @xmath12 on @xmath9 does not modify the above analysis , up to a redefinition of @xmath12 .",
    "note also that all phenomenological coefficients are , at least in principle , measurable in situations independent from ripple formation ( since they are diffusion constants , convection velocities , deposition rates etc . ) . in this sense",
    "it should be possible to check experimentally for the consistency of the above description .",
    "our conclusions are very similar to those reached by anderson @xcite , on the basis of a simplified model where the flowing phase ( what we have called @xmath9 above ) is assumed to be in equilibrium from the outset , and where a rather arbitrary distinction is made between ` saltating grains ' which are never captured by the bed , and ` reptating ' grains which are captured after exactly one jump .",
    "correspondingly , the structure of the dispersion relations differ in the two approaches .",
    "furthermore , it is difficult to extend anderson s model beyond the linear instability analysis while our model , in principle , can account for non - linear effects @xcite .",
    "finally , there are several open questions which we would like to mention and leave for future work : ( i ) can one establish some precise relations between the ` microscopic ' coefficients ( like wind velocity , polydispersity , elasticity etc . ) and the phenomenological parameters ? ( ii ) how are the above results modified if one considers two spatial dimensions ?",
    "is there an instability corresponding to the transverse wavelike shape of the ripples known from field observation ?",
    "what is the ripple shape and height predicted from a non - linear analysis of the equations ?",
    "( iv ) is it important to consider a non - local convection term , rather than the hydrodynamical form written in ( 1 ) ?",
    "the question arises since the relevant wavelength is precisely of the same order as ( and not much larger than ) the jump length @xmath1 .",
