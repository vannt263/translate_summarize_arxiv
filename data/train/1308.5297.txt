    "in predicting the effects of correlations between the positions of a molecule s electrons , one must go beyond the independent particle approximation embodied by the slater determinant ansatz . in most quantum chemical methods",
    "used today , correlations are accounted for in an essentially perturbative manner : kohn - sham density functional theory @xcite , mller - plesset perturbation theory @xcite , and single - reference coupled cluster theory @xcite all rely on the fundamental assumption that electron correlation does not greatly alter the wave function structure beyond what can be encoded in a single slater determinant .",
    "this assumption can be used to define two classes of electron correlation .",
    "weak , or dynamic , correlations are those that can be incorporated accurately under this essentially perturbative framework .",
    "strong , or static , correlations , on the other hand , are those that can not be accounted for by perturbing around a single slater determinant . while this division is certainly not the only useful way to distinguish different classes of electron correlation , it will serve as the definition of weak and strong for the purposes of this manuscript .    traditionally , the strong electron correlations encountered in excited states , bond dissociations , and transition metal chemistry have been treated using active space theories @xcite . instead of dividing molecular orbitals into occupied and unoccupied categories based on the presence of a large gap in the orbital energy spectrum , which is typically lacking in systems with strong electron correlations , these methods divide orbitals into three categories : low energy orbitals that can be safely assumed to be doubly occupied , high energy orbitals that can be assumed empty , and a set of orbitals near the fermi energy that admit multiple competitive electronic configurations .",
    "while this active space is of course much smaller than the full hilbert space , it still grows combinatorially with system size , causing methods that rely on it to scale exponentially .",
    "here we pursue an alternative approach to electron correlation that does not rely on either the independent particle approximation or the use of an active space .",
    "instead , the conceptual starting point is a molecule whose electrons are organized into a valence bonding pattern constructed from a product of two - electron units ( bonds , lone pairs , etc . ) .",
    "this picture is encoded by the perfect pairing ( pp ) ansatz @xcite and its generalizations , in which the wave function is constructed explicitly as an antisymmetric product of two - electron functions ( geminals ) .",
    "this approach can be seen as a direct generalization of the slater determinant , which is product of one - electron functions ( orbitals ) , that seeks to treat electron correlation in a pairwise manner .",
    "there are , however , two major problems with the perfect pairing approach .",
    "first , in order to be computationally feasible , additional approximations must be made in which the geminals are constrained to be strongly @xcite or at least partially @xcite orthogonal to each other , which reduces the ansatz s ability to capture inter - pair electron correlations @xcite .",
    "second , the organization of electrons into a single pairing structure makes it difficult to describe wave functions that resonate between multiple valence bonding patterns .",
    "this shortcoming causes pp to exhibit sharp cusps in its potential energy surfaces when the energies of solutions corresponding to different pairing motifs cross @xcite .",
    "many attempts to repair these problems have been made , including theories based on configuration interaction @xcite , coupled cluster @xcite , perturbation theory @xcite , and hopf algebra @xcite .",
    "however , these approaches all violate one or more of pp s important formal properties : size consistency ( additive energies of separated subsystems ) , variational energies , and polynomial cost .",
    "this paper will show that by using the hilbert space version @xcite of the jastrow - modified antisymmetric geminal power ( jagp ) ansatz @xcite , both inter - pair correlations and multiple resonance structures can be described without sacrificing the variational principle , size consistency , or polynomial cost . on its own",
    ", the geminal power can create a superposition of multiple resonance structures using non - orthogonal local geminals .",
    "however , in addition to the resonance structures we want , this superposition will typically also contain unphysical resonance structures in which too many electrons are present on one bond or atom . by incorporating the hilbert space jastrow factor , which can delete terms with undesirable electron concentrations @xcite",
    ", we prune away these unphysical resonance structures to produce the desired superposition of physically relevant valence bond structures , each of which is a product of several non - orthogonal local geminals .",
    "we will show that this ansatz captures the most important electron correlations in a variety of strongly correlated molecular examples , and that it can be optimized for a cost that scales polynomially as the fifth power of the system size .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin with an overview of the jagp ansatz and the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) framework in which our methods are based ( section [ sec : basics ] ) .",
    "we then discuss the slightly non - standard way in which we organize the terms of the ab initio hamiltonian ( section [ sec : hamiltonian ] ) before presenting the polynomial cost algorithms for evaluating ( sections [ sec : agp_energy ] and [ sec : jagp_energy ] ) and optimizing ( sections [ sec : derivatives ] and [ sec : optimization ] ) the jagp energy .",
    "we then present results showing the convergence behavior of the optimization ( section [ sec : convergence ] ) , performance in a pedegogical example involving h@xmath1 ( section [ sec : hydrogen ] ) , and the accuracy of the method for singlet - state multi - bond stretching ( sections [ sec : h2o ] and [ sec : n2 ] ) , triplet - state multi - bond stretching ( section [ sec : c2 ] ) , and barrier height evaluation for a novel ethene hydrogenation mechanism ( section [ sec : ethene ] ) .",
    "we conclude ( section [ sec : conclusions ] ) with a summary of our findings and comments on the future development of the jagp ."
