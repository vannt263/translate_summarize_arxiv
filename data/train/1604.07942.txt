    "large - scale magnetic fields of turbulent fluids do not strictly follow the mean fluid motion .",
    "this is not only because the fields are subject to turbulent diffusion .",
    "mean - field magnetohydrodynamics also predicts the effects of the large - scale field pumping with effective velocities which are not the actual velocities of fluid motion .",
    "the fields are expelled from the regions of relatively high turbulence intensity with the effective velocity @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the eddy magnetic diffusivity ; * ? ? ?",
    "diamagnetic pumping was also found in 3d numerical experiments @xcite and in a laboratory experiment with liquid sodium @xcite .",
    "diamagnetic pumping is significant for the modelling of the solar dynamo . @xcite and @xcite found that allowance for the pumping brings their models results closer to observations .",
    "they in particular noticed that a horizontal component , which the pumping velocity may possess in addition to its ( dominant ) radial part , can be significant for latitudinal drift of magnetic fields .",
    "the observed equatorial drift of sunspot activity is believed to result primarily from a deep equatorward meridional flow @xcite .",
    "however , horizontal turbulent pumping - if it exists - may also play a role .",
    "horizontal pumping can result from the influence of rotation on convective turbulence .",
    "the influence elongates convective eddies along the rotation axis to induce turbulence anisotropy .",
    "the resulting _ anisotropic _ pumping not only achieves a horizontal component but transports the poloidal and toroidal large - scale fields with different velocities .",
    "these circumstances were demonstrated in the case of effective transport due to stratification of density in turbulent fluid @xcite - a weaker effect compared to the diamagnetic pumping near the base of convection zone .",
    "almost all effects of mean - field mhd for rotating turbulence were analysed in the nineties except diamagnetic pumping ( cf .",
    ", however , * ? ? ?",
    "this paper fills the gap .",
    "we shall see that the diamagnetic pumping indeed attains a horizontal component in rotating fluids but only for poloidal fields which are transported with a different velocity compared to that of toroidal fields .",
    "the relative value of toroidal field transport ( in relation to the turbulent diffusion ) is enhanced by rotation .",
    "pictorial interpretations can be given to all of these findings . before deriving the diamagnetic pumping , however , it is worth discussing in more detail why can it be significant for the solar dynamo .",
    "the region near the base of the convection zone has long been recognised as a favourable site for the solar dynamo .",
    "diamagnetic pumping concentrates magnetic fields towards this site .",
    "the generation of super - kilogauss toroidal fields is hardly possible without this concentration .",
    "it is generally acknowledged that toroidal fields ( @xmath3 ) are wound from poloidal ones ( @xmath4 ) by differential rotation .",
    "the winding process is accounted for by the following term , @xmath5 on the right - hand side of the toroidal field induction equation . in this equation",
    ", @xmath6 is the angular velocity , @xmath7 is the heliocentric radius and @xmath8 is the co - latitude .",
    "the upper bound for the amplitude of the toroidal field , which can be wound in the course of a solar cycle , can be estimated as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the ( local ) amplitude of the poloidal field and the conversion factor @xmath11 reads @xmath12 with @xmath13years as a cycle period .",
    "the angular velocity gradients in the solar interior were detected seismologically by @xcite .",
    "the conversion factor of eq.([2 ] ) estimated using their data ( gong data averaged over the 23rd solar cycle ) is shown in fig.[f1 ] .    ) estimated from the helioseismological data on the gradients of rotation rate of @xcite ( colour online ) .",
    ", width=10 ]    helioseismology may underestimate the radial gradient of rotation in the tachocline region .",
    "however , the radial gradient shears the radial field , which should be small in the tachocline region .",
    "otherwise it is a relic field penetrating from the radiative interior .",
    "the conversion factor of eq.([2 ] ) is an upper bound , which can be reached only if the poloidal field and rotation gradient are perfectly aligned . also taking @xmath14 as the winding time overestimates the conversion factor .",
    "the toroidal field is amplified only on the rise phase of an activity cycle , before the poloidal field inversion . however , even the upper bounds of the conversion factor of fig.[f1 ] are too small for producing super - kilogauss toroidal fields with distributed dynamo models .",
    "@xcite estimated the total magnetic flux of the active regions of a solar cycle to exceed @xmath15mx .",
    "their estimations also suggest that a comparable or perhaps slightly smaller toroidal flux should be stored near the bottom of the convection zone at the activity maxima . assuming the latitudinal extend of the storage region of about @xmath16 and its radial extend @xmath17",
    ", we find the low bound for the toroidal field strength of about @xmath18gs .",
    "@xcite found that the net toroidal flux does not depend on how the poloidal field is distributed inside the convection zone .",
    "the flux is uniquely defined by the surface radial field and differential rotation .",
    "the observed surface fields correspond to the peak values of toroidal flux of about @xmath19mx in the recent solar cycles 22 and 23 @xcite .",
    "if the surface active regions emerge from near the base of the convection zone , super - kiligauss toroidal fields should be present in the near - base region .",
    "the large - scale poloidal field on the solar surface is of the order of 1 gauss @xcite .",
    "if the field is distributed smoothly inside the convection zone , toroidal fields well below one kilogauss are produced near its base ( fig.[f1 ] ) .",
    "it may be argued that this refers to the mean or large - scale field only .",
    "the field in convectively - unstable fluids fragments in a fibril state with a much stronger field in the fibrils compared to its mean value @xcite . however , the magnetic flux of a sub - kilogauss _ mean _ toroidal field in the near - bottom region is too small ( @xmath20mx ) to feed active regions of a solar cycle .",
    "the problem can be resolved by downward diamagnetic pumping .",
    "the meridional field pumped to the base of convection zone can be two orders of magnitude stronger compared to the surface poloidal field @xcite .",
    "the conversion factors of fig.[f1 ] then suffice for producing super - kilogauss toroidal fields .",
    "it may also be noted that the model with diamagnetic pumping realises an interface dynamo in spite of the model s being of distributed type .",
    "the model is , however , sensitive to details of the turbulent diffusivity profile , specification of which remains to be a source of uncertainties .",
    "diamagnetic pumping seems to be necessary for reproducing the observationally suggested combination of weak poloidal and strong toroidal fields in dynamo models .",
    "otherwise , polar fields over one hundred gauss are required for producing super - kilogauss toroidal fields @xcite .",
    "mean - field magnetohydrodynamics includes the effect of turbulence in the mean magnetic field ( @xmath21 ) induction equation , @xmath22 via the mean electromotive force ( emf ) , @xmath23 which is the mean of the cross - product of the fluctuating velocity , @xmath24 , and magnetic field , @xmath25 .",
    "we derive that part of the emf that represents the diamagnetic pumping .",
    "the derivations are performed in the quasi - linear approximation known also as the second - order correlation approximation ( soca ) or the first - order smoothing ( fosa ) .",
    "the approximation is justified for the cases of small reynolds numbers or short correlation times only .",
    "solar convective turbulence does not belong to either of these cases .",
    "however , the existence of the limits , for which the quasi - linear approximation is valid , ensures this approximation from unphysical results .",
    "the approximation can be expected to remain valid by order of magnitude also beyond its justification limits . the expectation often - though not always - comes true @xcite .",
    "however , some disagreement about the validity of quasi - linear approximation at the astrophysical case of high magnetic reynolds number still remains .",
    "inhomogeneity of the mean field @xmath21 is not essential for the contribution of the diamagnetic pumping , @xmath26 , in the emf .",
    "derivations are therefore performed for the uniform mean field .",
    "inhomogeneity of the turbulence intensity has , however , to be included .",
    "derivations are performed in a rotating frame to include the effect of rotation .",
    "the influence of the mean magnetic field on turbulence is neglected ( the nonlinear diamagnetic pumping was considered by * ? ? ?",
    "the quasi - linear approximation for rotating inhomogeneous fluids was discussed in detail elsewhere @xcite and will be repeated here only briefly .",
    "the approximation neglects the nonlinear terms in the equations for fluctuating magnetic and velocity fields .",
    "the characteristic temporal and spatial scales of fluctuating fields are assumed small compared to the mean - field scales .",
    "variations of the mean fields during the correlation time and over the correlation length of turbulence are neglected in the derivations of the diamagnetic pumping .",
    "it is then convenient to use the fourier transform for the fluctuating velocity , @xmath27 and the same for the fluctuating magnetic field .",
    "the transform simplifies matters by converting partial differential equations into algebraic equations to yield the following relations @xmath28 where repetition of subscripts signifies summation and @xmath29 corresponds to the so - called original \" turbulence not perturbed by rotation .",
    "the influence of rotation is included via the tensor @xmath30 the original turbulence is assumed to be statistically steady but not uniform .",
    "the simplest spectral tensor , which allows for the inhomogeneity of turbulence intensity , reads @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 in eq.([8 ] ) is the fourier transform of the local spectrum @xmath35 : @xmath36    on using eqs .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) to ( [ 8 ] ) , the fourier transform of the emf ( [ 4 ] ) can be constructed .",
    "the inverse fourier transform then gives the sought - for emf . only the even terms in the angular velocity should be kept in the derivations .",
    "the even terms represent the contribution @xmath26 of the diamagnetic pumping .",
    "the odd terms stand for the alpha - effect @xcite , which we do not consider .      the derivation of the diamagnetic pumping for rotating fluid outlined above yields @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the unit vector along the rotation axis and the effective velocities , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , are gradients of scalar functions : @xmath41 the @xmath42-functions of the angular velocity and parameters of turbulence will be specified shortly .",
    "the emf ( [ 10 ] ) describes an anisotropic diamagnetic pumping by rotating turbulence .",
    "the anisotropy in particular means that the direction of transport depends on the direction of the mean magnetic field @xmath21 @xcite . for the often assumed case of axial symmetry",
    ", the toroidal field is transported with the velocity @xmath39 .",
    "this can be seen from eq.([10 ] ) if we note that the dot product of the toroidal field with vector @xmath43 is zero .",
    "the pumping velocity for the ( axisymmetric ) poloidal field can be found by noticing that only the component @xmath44 of the velocity @xmath40 normal to the rotation axis contributes to the second term on the right - hand side of eq.([10 ] ) .",
    "then , for the axisymmetric case considered , this second term can be rewritten as @xmath45 where @xmath4 is the poloidal field .",
    "this field is , therefore , transported with the velocity @xmath46 for the practically important case of the @xmath42-functions of eq.([11 ] ) varying only with radius @xmath7 , the transport velocities read @xmath47 in this equation , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the radial and meridional unit vectors respectively .",
    "the toroidal field is pumped radially inward and the poloidal field - inward in radius and towards the equator according to the eq.([14 ] ) .",
    "quasilinear expressions for the @xmath42-functions are rather complicated .",
    "they include spectral integrals of complicated functions ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , not appropriate for use in dynamo models .",
    "sufficient simplification provides the mixing - length approximation ( also known as the @xmath50-approximation ) . in this approximation ,",
    "the local spectrum ( [ 9 ] ) includes the only scale @xmath51 ( @xmath52 is the rms velocity and @xmath50 is the convective turnover time ) : @xmath53 viscosity and magnetic diffusivity are replaced by the order of magnitude estimations of their effective values @xmath54 the @xmath42-functions of eqs ( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) then read @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the background eddy diffusivity and the dependence on rotation rate is involved via the new @xmath57-functions of the coriolis number @xmath58 this number measures the intensity of interaction between convection and rotation .",
    "the coriolis number in the sun increases with depth and exceeds 10 near the bottom of the convection zone where the diamagnetic pumping is most significant .",
    "the @xmath57-functions of eq.([17 ] ) read @xmath59 the functions are shown in fig.[f2 ] .",
    "-functions of eq.([17 ] ) defining the dependence of diamagnetic pumping on rotation rate .",
    ", width=10 ]    in spite of the @xmath60 in denominators of the functions ( [ 19 ] ) , they approach finite values for the small coriolis number : @xmath61 and @xmath62 for @xmath63 . in the limit of vanishing rotation ,",
    "therefore , the pumping becomes isotropic with equal transport velocities @xmath64 for poloidal and toroidal fields to reproduce the known result for non - rotating fluids @xcite .    in the opposite limit of very fast rotation , the @xmath57-functions of eq.([19 ] )",
    "decrease in inverse proportion to the coriolis number : @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "the pumping velocities ( [ 14 ] ) for toroidal and poloidal fields differ in this rapid rotation case .",
    "close to the equator , in particular , the transport velocity for the poloidal field vanishes while the toroidal field is transported with the velocity @xmath67 .",
    "this finding reproduces the long known result of @xcite for two - dimensional turbulence .",
    "the point here is that turbulence approaches two - dimensionality at the rapid rotation .",
    "the flow is almost uniform along the rotation axis .",
    "@xcite found that the field normal to the direction along which the 2d turbulent flow does not vary is transported with the effective velocity @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the eddy diffusivity for this field .",
    "the field parallel to this direction , however , is not subject to the pumping .",
    "this is why the pumping velocity of the poloidal field disappears near the equator at the rapid rotation .",
    "it remains to be noted that the turbulent magnetic diffusion is also anisotropic in rotating fluids and the @xmath69 diffusivity applies to the direction normal to the rotation axis in the rapid rotation limit ( * ? ? ?",
    "* the diffusivity along the rotation axis is twice as large ) .",
    "super - kilogauss toroidal fields with magnetic flux in excess of @xmath15  mx in the near - bottom region of the convection zone are required in order to reverse and then replenish the global poloidal field by the babcock - leighton mechanism in the course of a solar cycle @xcite .",
    "such strong fields , however , can not be produced by the differential rotation in a distributed dynamo scenario ( fig.[f1 ] ) .",
    "some mechanism for the field concentration at the base of convection zone is necessary .",
    "the concentration can be provided by the diamagnetic expulsion of large - scale fields from the regions of relatively large turbulence intensity @xcite .",
    "the diamagnetic pumping is most efficient near the base of the convection zone where convective turbulence is strongly inhomogeneous .",
    "allowance for the downward pumping helps to realise an interface dynamo in models with distributed design @xcite .    in this paper , diamagnetic",
    "pumping by rotating turbulence was derived .",
    "the transport velocities of eq.([14 ] ) reproduce previously known results for cases of very slow and very rapid rotation and extend them to arbitrary rotation rates",
    ". the transport velocities for ( axisymmetric ) toroidal and poloidal fields differ .",
    "the toroidal field is pumped downward while the transport of the poloidal field has a horizontal part towards the equator .",
    "the horizontal transport can influence the latitudinal migration of the field in dynamo models @xcite though the field advection by the meridional flow is probably more significant .",
    "a more important effect of rotation seems to be the increase of the proportionality coefficient between the pumping velocity of the toroidal field and the diffusivity gradient .",
    "the increase from 1/2 for slow rotation to 1 for rapid rotation may seem to be slight but can , nevertheless , be important .",
    "let us imagine a slab of turbulent fluid bounded by , say , horizontal superconducting planes .",
    "let the large - scale horizontal field @xmath70 in the slab be subject to turbulent diffusion with diffusivity @xmath71 and pumping with the effective velocity @xmath72 .",
    "if both the field and the eddy diffusivity are horizontally uniform and vary in vertical direction only , the steady solution of the mean - field induction equation demands @xmath73 .",
    "the steady field - profile is very sensitive to the power index @xmath74 if the diffusivity varies across the slab as strongly as it does near the base of the solar convection zone .",
    "other types of turbulent transport can operate in stellar convection zones .",
    "the topological pumping of @xcite due to the asymmetry between upward and downward flows is a widely known example .",
    "however , the strong inhomogeneity of convective intensity near the base of the convection zone probably makes the diamagnetic pumping dominant in this region .",
    "it is also not clear whether the topological asymmetry can be relevant to the almost 2d convection at high coriolis numbers .",
