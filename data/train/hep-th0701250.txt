    "this article is the second in a series in which we analyse well - known conformal field theories from the viewpoint of an extended symmetry algebra defined by a simple current . here , we present the minimal model case .",
    "this series was initiated by @xcite , in which we constructed and studied the extended algebras of the @xmath3 wess - zumino - witten models .",
    "whilst these two articles are formally independent , we will see that the main results obtained in @xcite have formal analogues in the study of the minimal model extended algebras .",
    "the construction of the latter is in fact easier in many respects , because the algebra is only graded by the conformal dimension , and not additionally by the @xmath4-weight .",
    "however , this structural reduction makes the analysis of the minimal model extended algebras somewhat more difficult than the @xmath3 case .      the reformulation of the minimal models from the point of view of the extended algebra generated by their simple current fits within the general program of trying to understand and/or derive fermionic character formulae ( see for example @xcite ) by intrinsic conformal field theoretical methods .",
    "such fermionic formulae reflect the description of the space of states in terms of quasi - particles subject to some restriction rules . within the framework developed here ,",
    "the quasi - particles are represented by the modes of the simple current .",
    "the first objective towards constructing the fermionic formula is to derive a complete set of constraints on strings of these simple current modes so as to obtain a complete description of the space of states .",
    "the character will then be the generating functions of these states",
    ".    the best studied minimal models are those with @xmath5 .",
    "their basis of states has been derived in @xcite ( through an analysis inspired in part by that of the parafermionic models in @xcite ) . for fixed @xmath6 ,",
    "the basis is formulated in terms of the virasoro modes and it is controlled by partitions with difference @xmath7 at distance @xmath8 , where @xmath9 .",
    "however , these models do not fit within our framework as they possess no simple current .",
    "more precisely , the simple current of the @xmath10 models reduces to the identity field .",
    "the next simplest cases are the @xmath11 models . here",
    ", there exists a non - trivial simple current , namely @xmath12 .",
    "these minimal models have been reformulated from the point of view of the extended algebra generated by @xmath12 in @xcite , and this reformulation has led to the proposal of a basis of states expressed solely in terms of the @xmath12 modes modes and it unifies , in a sense , the @xmath5 and @xmath13 bases . ]",
    "( see also related results in @xcite ) .",
    "although some justifications for the linear independence and spanning property of the states were discussed , no formal proofs were presented , although the resulting fermionic characters were derived , reproducing known expressions ( given for instance in @xcite ) .",
    "there are two natural ways to extend these results to @xmath14 .",
    "one can either pursue the construction of a basis in terms of @xmath12  noting that for @xmath14 , @xmath12 is no longer a simple current  or look for an extended formulation in terms of the new model s simple current .",
    "the description of the basis of states for the @xmath0 models with @xmath14 in terms of the @xmath12 modes is plagued with serious technical difficulties rooted in the fact that the operator product expansion of @xmath12 with itself has more than one channel .",
    "this construction is pursued in @xcite . here",
    "we follow the second approach , which amounts to giving the role of basic generator , played by @xmath12 in the @xmath11 extended algebra , to the corresponding simple current of the general @xmath0 model , @xmath15 .",
    "this simple current is @xmath16 ( section  [ secnotation ] ) .    in @xcite , the @xmath11 basis of states",
    "is formulated in terms of @xmath6-dependent constraints on the strings of modes of @xmath12 at distance 1 and 2 .",
    "however , the precise mechanism by which these constraints arise was not clearly isolated . do these conditions on the basis of states follow solely from the operator product expansion of @xmath17 with itself , by considering a sufficiently large number of terms ( as exploratory computations seem to indicate ) ? do the vacuum and simple current singular vectors play any role with regard to these constraints ? moreover , in @xcite it was implicitly assumed that there are no singular vectors in the extended algebra , so that no subtractions were needed to construct the character .",
    "however , no arguments supporting this assumption were presented there , apart from the fact that ignoring such potential singular vectors did indeed reproduce the correct characters . finally , all issues relating to linear independence of the proposed basis could be treated rather informally because the fermionic characters , with which the state generating function could be compared , were already known in precisely the same form .    for @xmath14 ,",
    "the situation is completely different .",
    "although fermionic expressions are known for all irreducible minimal models @xcite , they are not obviously of the type that would suit the combinatorial descriptions of the bases found for @xmath13 . to make progress",
    "then , we require definite conclusions concerning the representation theory of the algebra defined by the simple current modes .",
    "it is therefore mandatory ( both for the @xmath13 case and its generalisation ) to consolidate the foundation and reanalyse carefully the mathematical formalism implied by this simple current approach .",
    "this is the subject of the present paper .",
    "basis issues will be reported in a sequel @xcite .",
    "we mention that reformulating theories through a quasi - particle approach has many physical advantages and applications .",
    "as some of these have already been discussed in @xcite , we will not address them further here .",
    "the article is organised as follows .",
    "some preliminary results are first collected in the following subsection , where we also fix the notation .",
    "the extended algebra itself is defined in section  [ secstructure ] .",
    "in short , this algebra is defined by the operator product expansion of the simple current @xmath16 with itself .",
    "we first examine the commutativity and associativity of the defining operator product expansion , and a neat ( rigorous ) argument is presented for the necessity of introducing an @xmath18-type operator in this expansion , anticommuting with the simple current modes when @xmath19 is odd . whilst the necessity of such an operator is not seen at the level of the full ( non - chiral ) theory ( which explains why it was not observed until recently ) , we show that its presence is nevertheless essential to a consistent treatment of the representation theory .",
    "it is then a simple matter to extend the virasoro algebra to the algebra defined by the simple current modes .",
    "an important consequence of the dimension of @xmath16 not necessarily being integral or half - integral is that the defining relations of the algebra of modes must be formulated in terms of generalised commutation relations involving infinite sums .",
    "the representation theory of this _ extended algebra _ is then developed in section  [ secreptheory ] .",
    "we emphasise here the central role played by the monodromy charge .",
    "symmetry properties of the generalised commutation relations are also studied , and we identify for later use those generalised commutation relations , amongst the many that we generate , which are actually independent .",
    "various examples of extended minimal models are presented in section  [ seccftequivs ] . in the context of extended algebras , we clarify the meaning of equivalence of two conformal field theories .",
    "we do this by introducing a sequence of ( partially ) extended models whose infinite limit is the genuine extension under study .",
    "these `` incomplete '' versions are in essence defined by truncating the depth at which the operator product expansion of @xmath16 with itself is probed .    the central result of the paper is then presented in section  [ secsingvect ] .",
    "there it is argued that in the extended algebra , all modules are free of singular vectors .",
    "this is first supported by a number of explicit computations within the simplest minimal models .",
    "then , a generic argument is presented which demonstrates that in the vacuum module of the extended theory , there are no singular vectors . in other words ,",
    "the vacuum verma module is already irreducible .",
    "finally , an appeal to a ( claimed ) general property of the virasoro vacuum singular vector ( the one at grade @xmath20 ) is used to lift this conclusion to the other ( extended ) highest weight modules appearing in the theory .",
    "the claimed general property in this case is that the corresponding null field completely controls the spectrum of the minimal model as well as _ all _ of its singular vectors .",
    "restated differently , our main result states that when taking into account sufficiently many of the terms in the operator product expansion of @xmath16 with itself , the vacuum and the simple current principal singular vectors identically vanish ( and we claim that this then implies the vanishing of the other singular vectors ) .",
    "this means that the corresponding virasoro singular vectors are coded as identities in the model s defining operator product expansion .",
    "but once this is established , it can be turned around and used to deduce recurrence relations for the various terms of this operator product expansion .",
    "such relations are derived in section  [ secapps ] .",
    "these appear to be rather powerful technical tools , as the displayed illustrative computations exemplify .",
    "the minimal models may be defined as those two - dimensional conformal field theories whose state space is constructed out of a finite number of irreducible representations of the virasoro algebra @xmath21 .",
    "this is the infinite dimensional lie algebra spanned by the modes @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) and @xmath24 , subject to the commutation relations @xmath25 } = { \\left ( m - n \\right ) } l_{m +",
    "n } + \\binom{m + 1}{3 } \\delta_{m + n , 0 }   \\frac{c}{2 } \\qquad \\text{and } \\qquad { \\bigl [ l_m , c \\bigr ] } = 0.\\ ] ] the @xmath22 are the modes of the energy - momentum field @xmath26 whose operator product expansion is @xmath27 the generator @xmath24 is central , and acts on the irreducible representations comprising the theory as multiplication by @xmath28 , the central charge .    up to a finite ambiguity in the modular invariant , the minimal models are classified by two coprime integers @xmath29 ( in fact , by their ratio ) .",
    "we will generally denote a minimal model by @xmath0 , presuming that the modular invariant is diagonal unless otherwise specified ( we will actually only be concerned with the structure of the theory at the chiral level ) .",
    "the central charge of @xmath0 is given by @xmath30 and the irreducible @xmath21-modules which appear ( the spectrum ) have highest weight states of conformal dimension @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we note the symmetry @xmath34 which implies a redundancy in the spectrum .",
    "we will generally denote a primary field of conformal dimension @xmath35 by @xmath36 , and the corresponding highest weight state by @xmath37 .",
    "the aforementioned symmetry is then expressed by the field identifications @xmath38 . in particular , the identity field is @xmath39 , and the corresponding highest weight state is the vacuum , which we denote by @xmath40 .",
    "the fusion rules for the ( diagonal ) minimal models are known explicitly @xcite , and read @xmath41 where the primed summation indicates that @xmath42 and @xmath43 increment in twos .",
    "we are interested in so - called _ simple currents _ , fields whose fusion with any primary field gives back a single primary field .",
    "we see that @xmath44 is therefore a simple current precisely when @xmath45 we consider equation  ( [ eqnsimpcurr2 ] ) first .",
    "when @xmath46 , this becomes @xmath47 , so squaring gives @xmath48 thus @xmath49 or @xmath50 ( forcing @xmath51 ) .",
    "similarly , when @xmath52 , @xmath53 , so @xmath54 again , @xmath50 or @xmath49 ( forcing @xmath55 ) .",
    "the analysis of equation  ( [ eqnsimpcurr1 ] ) is identical , so we find that the only simple currents are @xmath56 for @xmath57 , these coincide , so there are no non - trivial simple currents . for @xmath58 , there is a unique non - trivial simple current @xmath16 , which we will generally denote by @xmath59 for brevity .",
    "its conformal dimension is given by @xmath60 and its fusion rules take the simple form @xmath61 note that @xmath62 .",
    "we wish to extend the symmetry algebra of the minimal model @xmath0 by adjoining the modes @xmath63 of the simple current to the virasoro modes @xmath64 . because the conformal dimension @xmath65 of the simple current is not integral in general",
    ", we do not expect that this extended algebra will be a lie algebra , but will instead be defined by generalised commutation relations .",
    "mathematically , we therefore seek a ( graded ) associative algebra @xmath66 generated by the @xmath63 , in which @xmath21 , or rather its universal enveloping algebra @xmath67 appears as a ( graded ) subalgebra . here",
    ", the subscript `` @xmath68 '' indicates that we identify @xmath24 with @xmath69 in this universal enveloping algebra ( although we will often drop this subscript for brevity in what follows ) .    before turning to the construction of this algebra ,",
    "let us note that a part of the structure is already available to us .",
    "as @xmath70 is a primary field , its operator product expansion with the energy - momentum tensor is @xmath71 assuming that these two fields are mutually bosonic , this implies the familiar commutation rule @xmath72 } = \\bigl ( m { \\left ( h-1 \\right ) } - n \\bigr ) \\phi_{m+n}.\\ ] ] this ( mutually ) bosonic behaviour can in fact be derived , for example from the analogue of the jacobi identity ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  2.5 ) ) .",
    "we can also extend the canonical antilinear antiautomorphism @xmath73 ( defining the adjoint on representations ) to the simple current modes .",
    "the grading by conformal dimension restricts this extended adjoint to have the form @xmath74 , where @xmath75 . requiring this to be an antiautomorphism with respect to equation  ( [ eqncommlphi ] ) gives no further constraints on @xmath76 , so we may choose @xmath77 for simplicity . in other words ,",
    "we choose the adjoint of the extended theory to be given by @xmath78 we will verify later ( section  [ secalgebra ] ) that this defines an antilinear automorphism of the _ full _ extended algebra @xmath66 , defined by generalised commutation relations .",
    "we will suppose from now on that @xmath15 , so that there always exists a unique non - trivial simple current @xmath59 of order @xmath7 and conformal dimension @xmath79 .",
    "since @xmath62 , the corresponding operator product expansion must be of the form @xmath80 where @xmath81 should be the identity field .",
    "observe that the exponent @xmath82 need not be integral , signifying that we should take some care when using equation  ( [ eqnnaiveope ] ) in formal manipulations .",
    "one of the requirements of the fields of a conformal field theory is that they should satisfy some sort of _ mutual locality _ principle , meaning that the operator product expansion of two fields should be independent ( up to a statistical phase ) of the order in which the fields appear ) from equation  ( [ eqnopeprimary ] )  there the fields were mutually _ bosonic _ , meaning that the statistical phase factor is unity . ] . applying this principle to the operator product expansion ( [ eqnnaiveope ] ) however leads to a slight ambiguity when @xmath83 : comparing the expansions of @xmath84 and @xmath85 is not possible unless we first agree on how to compare @xmath86 with @xmath87 .",
    "this issue may be bypassed by reformulating the mutual locality principle as the following commutativity requirement : @xmath88 inserting the expansion ( [ eqnnaiveope ] ) and its @xmath89 analogue into this equation now leads to integral powers of @xmath90 and @xmath91 , settling the ambiguity mentioned above .",
    "we mention that in considering the mutual locality of two different fields ( such as the construction in @xcite ) , we need only require that the corresponding equality in equation  ( [ eqncommutativity ] ) hold up to a phase factor . however , it is easy to check that when the two fields are identical ( the case of interest here ) , this phase factor is necessarily unity .",
    "another requirement of the operator product expansion of fields is that it defines an associative operation . assuming this requirement , the triple product @xmath92 is unambiguously defined .",
    "we now derive an interesting conclusion by combining this requirement with the commutativity condition , equation  ( [ eqncommutativity ] ) , and the generic operator product expansion ( [ eqnnaiveope ] ) .    applying commutativity twice , we may write @xmath93 expanding @xmath94 as in equation  ( [ eqnnaiveope ] ) , multiplying both sides by @xmath95 ( for some arbitrary @xmath96 ) , and contour - integrating @xmath97 around @xmath98 gives @xmath99 } = 0.\\ ] ] as @xmath100 , this may be simplified to @xmath101 } = 0,\\ ] ] from which we may conclude that @xmath102 for each @xmath103 , by analysing @xmath104 consecutively .",
    "this proves that the fields @xmath105 appearing in the operator product expansion ( [ eqnnaiveope ] ) commute with @xmath70 when @xmath106 ( the fields are mutually bosonic ) , but anticommute with @xmath70 when @xmath83 ( the fields are mutually fermionic ) .",
    "recall now that @xmath107 was supposed to be the identity field .",
    "this clearly contradicts the above commutativity conclusion when @xmath83 .",
    "indeed , the @xmath105 with @xmath108 should be ( virasoro ) descendants of the identity field , hence should be expressible in terms of normally - ordered products of @xmath109 and its derivatives .",
    "but these are also mutually bosonic with respect to @xmath70 ( section  [ secnotation ] ) , so we face a similar contradiction .",
    "this contradiction can only be satisfactorily resolved if we assume that each @xmath105 contains an operator @xmath18 which satisfies @xmath110 such an operator @xmath18 was first introduced in @xcite for the @xmath11 models ( though with a less direct justification ) .",
    "it is worth noting that associativity does _ not _ require the introduction of @xmath18-type operators in the corresponding full non - chiral theories ( with the diagonal modular invariant ) @xcite .",
    "essentially , the antiholomorphic component will contribute an additional factor of @xmath111 to equation  ( [ eqncommaphi ] ) , removing the contradiction that necessitated the appearance of @xmath18 .",
    "whilst it may then be argued that this operator is in some sense `` unphysical '' , the fact remains that the discipline of conformal field theory rests heavily upon its chiral foundations , and many of its applications ( especially in mathematics , but also physically when boundaries are concerned ) require a consistent chiral formulation .",
    "we will illustrate this explicitly in section  [ secexamples ] , by demonstrating that the properties of @xmath18 are _ crucial _ in showing that the @xmath112 singular vectors vanish identically",
    ".    we will find it convenient to explicitly factor this operator @xmath18 out from each of the @xmath105 , redefining the latter so that the operator product expansion is @xmath113 this expansion replaces equation  ( [ eqnnaiveope ] ) , to which we shall not refer again .",
    "thus , for example , @xmath81 is now genuinely the identity field .",
    "we note that @xmath114 commutes with @xmath115 , hence with its modes , and is therefore a multiple of the identity in any irreducible module of the extended algebra ( which will be constructed shortly ) .",
    "we also note that @xmath18 must leave the vacuum @xmath116 invariant , so that it does not interfere with the state - field correspondence .",
    "we turn now to the derivation of the algebra defined by the modes of @xmath115 . at a formal level , this uses a standard trick @xcite involving the evaluation of @xmath117 in two distinct ways .",
    "we can expand the operator product directly , using equation  ( [ eqnopegeneral ] ) , or we can break the @xmath98-contour around @xmath118 into the difference of two contours about the origin , one with @xmath119 and the other with @xmath120 .",
    "the final result is a generalised commutation relation , parametrised by @xmath121 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 : @xmath122 = \\mathcal{s } \\sum_{j=0}^{\\gamma-1 } \\binom{m - h + \\gamma - 1}{\\gamma - 1 - j } a_{m+n}^{{\\left ( j \\right)}},\\ ] ] where @xmath123 denotes the modes of the fields @xmath124 appearing in the operator product expansion ( [ eqnopegeneral ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath121 determines how many terms of this operator product expansion contribute to the corresponding generalised commutation relation .",
    "we observe that if @xmath106 , the generalised commutation relations with @xmath125 reduce to commutation or anticommutation relations : @xmath126 in contrast , when @xmath83 , every generalised commutation relation has infinitely many terms on the left hand side .",
    "it remains to determine the fields @xmath124 , at least for small @xmath103 . as in @xcite , we invert equation  ( [ eqnopegeneral ] ) , @xmath127 let both sides act on the vacuum , and send @xmath118 to @xmath128 .",
    "the result determines the corresponding states as @xmath129 [ the fields @xmath124 may be expressed purely in terms of @xmath130 and its derivatives , hence @xmath131 is a linear combination of the grade @xmath103 virasoro descendants of the vacuum , and so @xmath132 . ]",
    "there is no such descendant at grade @xmath133 , so @xmath134 = 0 , hence @xmath135 .",
    "there is a unique virasoro descendant at grade @xmath7 , so @xmath136 must be proportional to @xmath137",
    ". this constant of proportionality may be evaluated by using equations  ( [ eqncommlphi ] ) and ( [ eqnvircomm ] ) to derive @xmath138 it follows that that @xmath139 .",
    "similarly , @xmath140 .    at grade @xmath141 , there are two possible virasoro descendants , so we have @xmath142 , for some unknowns @xmath143 and @xmath144 . applying @xmath145 and @xmath146 to both sides",
    "gives two linear equations to solve , which may be solved to give @xmath147 of course these expressions are all well - known @xcite .",
    "we remark that when @xmath148 , this last computation breaks down because the vacuum @xmath21-module has a singular vector at grade @xmath141 .",
    "as far as the inner - product is concerned , @xmath149 and @xmath150 are not linearly independent .",
    "we would therefore need to compute @xmath151 separately for this special value of the central charge ( choosing which state we regard as independent ) .",
    "of course , this central charge corresponds to the @xmath152 model , which is not of interest here , as it has no non - trivial simple current",
    ". however , singular vectors will eventually appear ( for example , at grade @xmath153 for @xmath154 ) and therefore complicate the calculations .",
    "it should be clear then that a knowledge of the singular vectors of the virasoro vacuum module is essential to continuing these derivations . whilst this knowledge is not beyond reach @xcite ,",
    "the implementation rapidly becomes cumbersome at higher grades .",
    "it is therefore worth observing that it is possible to derive recurrence relations for the @xmath124 .",
    "we will present such derivations as an application of our extended algebra formalism in section  [ secoperecursive ] .    for later reference",
    ", we display a few of the generalised commutation relations .",
    "when applying these relations , it is often useful to explicitly indicate the value of @xmath121 employed . as in @xcite , we will use `` @xmath155 '' to indicate an equality obtained using a generalised commutation relation with parameter @xmath121 .",

    "it may seem that the algebra @xmath66 is determined by an enormous number of generalised commutation relations . however , there is in fact a huge amount of redundancy present in these equations , which we shall now reveal .",
    "this redundancy is exposed by two easily derived symmetries of the expressions @xmath258 ( see equation  ( [ eqnrdefined ] ) ) , whose evaluation defines the generalised commutation relations . using the form of @xmath258 given on the right - hand - side of equation  ( [ eqngcrgeneral ] ) , and the binomial identity @xmath259 we easily derive that @xmath260 similarly , the left - hand - side of equation  ( [ eqngcrgeneral ] ) makes the following symmetry evident : @xmath261 it is important to realise that these symmetries should be viewed as identities in @xmath66 which make sense when applied to a state of definite monodromy charge .",

    "more interestingly , if we fix the conformal dimension @xmath264 ( which is of course conserved ) , then equation  ( [ eqnrsymm1 ] ) implies that every generalised commutation relation of order @xmath121 is equivalent to any other arbitrarily chosen generalised commutation relation of order @xmath121 , modulo those of order @xmath262 . in turn , this generalised commutation relation of order @xmath262 is equivalent to some arbitrarily chosen generalised commutation relation of order @xmath262 , modulo those of order @xmath265 , and so on . since @xmath266 for @xmath156 , we can conclude that any given generalised commutation relation is equivalent to a ( finite ) linear combination of `` basic '' generalised commutation relations , one for each order parameter @xmath121 .",
    "furthermore , we can choose these basic relations arbitrarily .",
    "there is one slight proviso to the above argument : we must respect monodromy charge restrictions throughout . practically , this means that for a given conformal dimension @xmath264 , there are in fact two disjoint classes of generalised commutation relations , corresponding to the two possible monodromy charges ( integral and half - integral ) of the states they are to act upon .",
    "this follows from equation  ( [ eqnrsymm1 ] ) by realising that it can not be used to relate @xmath258 with @xmath267 , because these would have to act on states of different monodromy charge .",
    "a more precise version of our above conclusion is therefore that by restricting to some fixed conformal dimension @xmath264 and monodromy charge @xmath206 , any given generalised commutation relation is equivalent to a ( finite ) linear combination of `` basic '' generalised commutation relations , of which there is one ( which we can choose arbitrarily ) for each order parameter @xmath121 .",
    "we can improve on this when @xmath121 is _ even _ by noting the following .",
    "if @xmath268 , equation  ( [ eqnrsymm2 ] ) implies that @xmath269 note that this may or may not be allowed by the monodromy charge of the state on which we are acting . if it is not , we note that if @xmath270 , equation  ( [ eqnrsymm2 ] ) implies that @xmath271 , and substituting into equation  ( [ eqnrsymm1 ] ) gives @xmath272 in either case , equation  ( [ eqnrsymm1 ] ) now implies that when @xmath121 is even , any generalised commutation relation with parameter @xmath121 may be expressed as a linear combination of generalised commutation relations with parameter @xmath262 . in other words , the set of generalised commutation relations with even parameter @xmath121 contains the same information as the set with parameter @xmath262 . from the point of view of a set of basic generalised commutation relations ( chosen arbitrarily )",
    ", this means that we can drop those corresponding to @xmath121 even .",
    "this explains the property observed in section  [ secseig ] that computing the eigenvalue of @xmath18 on a highest weight state of charge @xmath206 requires a generalised commutation relation of order @xmath246 when @xmath247 , but only @xmath248 when @xmath249 .",
    "essentially , @xmath246 is the correct order , but when @xmath249 , @xmath273 is even , hence it is convenient to use instead the ( equivalent ) generalised commutation relations of order @xmath274 .",

    "the simple current @xmath277 has conformal dimension @xmath278 , and it is well - known that the extended theory describes a free fermion .",

    "we may therefore treat it as a scaling factor , which we could set equal to the identity by suitably choosing the norms of the constituent @xmath21-highest weight states ( section  [ secseig ] ) . alternatively ( and equivalently )",

    "finally , we recover the familiar anticommutation relation from the generalised commutation relation with @xmath159 : @xmath284      now @xmath286 and @xmath287 , and we have the simplest example of a _ graded parafermionic _ theory , @xmath288 @xcite .",

    "this was overlooked in the original treatments ( but corrected in @xcite ) .",
    "one may wonder why we do not just redefine the simple current field , as we did with @xmath154 , to remove @xmath18 from @xmath84 .",
    "taking @xmath293 such that @xmath294 , we can define @xmath295 to achieve this goal .",
    "however , we then face the problem that @xmath296 satisfies the same commutativity relations as @xmath115 , so associativity ( section  [ secassoc ] ) demands that @xmath297 involve an @xmath18-type operator , contradicting the fact that it was constructed so as not to .",
    "the problem here is that it is in fact not possible to make the above redefinition because @xmath18 does _ not _ have such a square root has _",

    "we have just seen that the algebraic structure of the extensions of several minimal models can be identified with that of other well - known conformal field theories .",
    "specifically , we have based this ( loose ) identification on the explicit form of a _",
    "finite _ number of terms of the operator product expansion @xmath84 ( or on the terms of a particular generalised commutation relation ) .",
    "however , this only guarantees that the generalised commutation relations defining the extended chiral algebra have analogues under our identification when @xmath121 is sufficiently small , hence not for arbitrary values of @xmath121 .",
    "as might be expected , this means that it is strictly speaking _ incorrect _ to declare that these extended minimal models are precisely the respective well - known models that we have loosely identified them with , because their chiral algebras may not be isomorphic .",
    "we are therefore led to a consideration of precisely what we mean when we say that two conformal field theories are equivalent and equally , what we mean by saying that one is an extension of another .    before discussing these considerations ,",
    "let us remark that this concern is indeed valid , because such mismatches between chiral algebras have tangible consequences at the level of representation theory .",
    "this is best illustrated with the example of the extended algebra of the @xmath306 models @xmath310 and @xmath311 , considered in section  [ secex ] .",
    "there , we identified these extended algebras with those of certain _ superconformal _ minimal models , exhibiting a super - virasoro algebra ( @xmath316 ) symmetry .",
    "specifically , extending @xmath310 gave ( roughly speaking ) @xmath314 , and extending @xmath311 gave @xmath315 .",
    "the easiest way of seeing that the corresponding chiral algebras are _ not _ isomorphic is to note that the @xmath317 and @xmath318-verma modules are irreducible ( as we shall prove in section  [ secgensingvect ] ) , whereas it is well - known that those of the corresponding super - virasoro algebras are not ( they contain non - trivial singular vectors ) .",
    "as the definitions of highest weight state and verma module for these two chiral algebras are compatible , the notion of irreducibility should be preserved by any algebra isomorphism .",
    "we are therefore forced to conclude that @xmath317 and @xmath318 are _ not _ actually isomorphic to ( the universal enveloping algebra of ) the corresponding super - virasoro algebras , @xmath319 and @xmath320 , respectively .",
    "the identification made in section  [ secex ] ( which we have just questioned ) was limited to equation  ( [ eqngcr3h=3/2 ] ) , the generalised commutation relations with @xmath239 .",
    "the results of section  [ secrsymm ] demonstrate that these generalised commutation relations imply those with @xmath321 , but not necessarily those with @xmath322 .",
    "our non - isomorphism result therefore requires that there exist further identities satisfied in @xmath317 and @xmath318 , which have no counterpart in the super - virasoro algebra ( and are responsible for the irreducibility of the verma modules of the extended theory ) .",
    "for example , we could consider the generalised commutation relation with @xmath204 , which receives a contribution from the first regular term in the operator product expansion @xmath84 . at the level of fields",
    ", we have ( using equation  ( [ eqndefg ] ) ) @xmath323 the latter relation is of course standard for superconformal field theories , and reflects the ( @xmath239 ) anticommutation relation @xmath324 ( this illustrates the fact that when @xmath121 is even , the generalised commutation relations of order @xmath121 may be obtained from those of order @xmath262 . ) the generalised commutation relations with @xmath244 however imply the identity @xmath325 which is not a generic identity in superconformal field theory .",
    "indeed , we will see in section  [ secexamples ] that such a relation can not be satisfied identically , because the @xmath244 generalised commutation relations are sufficient to prove the vanishing of the first singular vector in the extended algebra vacuum verma module , but this vector does not vanish identically in the super - virasoro vacuum verma module .    this example is typical of the general situation : comparing a finite number of terms in the defining operator product expansions ( or generalised commutation relations ) is not generally enough to demonstrate an isomorphism of chiral algebras ( even if all singular terms are included ) . to make this point precise , we introduce a sequence of extended chiral algebras @xmath326 , @xmath96 , in which only the generalised commutation relations of order @xmath121 are imposed .",
    "the results of section  [ secrsymm ] allow us to depict this sequence as follows : @xmath327 here , @xmath328 denotes the free algebra generated by the @xmath63 modes , and the arrow from @xmath329 to @xmath326 represents the quotient map obtained by factoring out the ( two - sided ) ideal generated by the generalised commutation relations of order @xmath121 .",
    "the `` fully '' extended algebra @xmath66 is then the _ direct limit _ of these `` partially '' extended algebras : @xmath330    in this formalism , the precise version of the correspondence between @xmath317 , @xmath318 and the appropriate super - virasoro algebras is as follows @xmath3 wess - zumino - witten model by @xmath331 , then the precise isomorphisms proved there are @xmath332 we expect that the first of these isomorphisms can be extended to all @xmath333 ( hence for the fully extended algebras ) .",
    "the presence of non - trivial @xmath334-singular vectors implies that such an extension is not possible in the second case ( hence the non - isomorphism indicated ) . ] : @xmath335 the compatibility of the respective definitions of a highest weight state imply that these isomorphic chiral algebras have isomorphic verma modules , and more importantly , isomorphic irreducible highest weight modules . in general then , a simple current defines an infinite family of extended chiral algebras , parametrised by the order ( @xmath121 ) of the defining generalised commutation relations . in this sense , @xmath336 is _ an _ extension of @xmath337 , but not a `` maximal '' extension ( in the obvious sense ) .    physically however , it is not the verma modules which are fundamental , but the corresponding irreducible modules .",
    "we might expect that different extensions ( defined by different @xmath121 ) would have isomorphic irreducible representations , and this is indeed true under one important proviso .",
    "this follows from the fact that it is immaterial to the construction of the irreducible modules from the verma modules whether the singular vectors vanish identically or are quotiented out .",
    "the proviso follows from the fact that the algebraic structure of the extensions must be sufficient to be able to compute whether a given vector is singular or not .",
    "the general , but fundamental , requirement of actually being able to compute with a given symmetry algebra leads to quite non - trivial bounds on @xmath121 .",

    "instead , we recall that in a rational conformal field theory the vacuum singular vector is supposed to determine which highest weight modules can be consistently added to the theory . in other words , it controls the spectrum of the theory .",
    "specifically , a non - trivial singular vector @xmath413 of the vacuum module corresponds to a null field @xmath414 under the state - field correspondence .",

    "this begs the question : why do the singular vectors of the other highest weight modules of the theory not further restrict the spectrum ?",

    "the other factors give zero ( for some @xmath103 ) when @xmath183 divides @xmath481 ( abbreviated @xmath482 ) , hence when @xmath483 ( for some @xmath484 ) . in appendix  [ appnumtheory ] ( proposition  [ propnumth ] ) , we show that such @xmath8 only exist when @xmath183 is not a prime power .",
    "thus for @xmath485 , the corresponding recursion relation will fail to determine @xmath131 for at least two ( positive ) values for @xmath103 ( the precise number is determined in proposition  [ propnumth2 ] ) .",
    "one can analogously derive similar recursion relations from descendant singular vectors . we shall call these `` descendant recursion relations '' to distinguish them from the `` principal recursion relations '' discussed above .",
    "it is easy to show that these descendant recursion relations have coefficients whose common denominator is that of the principal recursion relation ( conjectured to be ( [ eqnconjcoeff ] ) ) , multiplied by other @xmath103-dependent factors which depend on the particular descendant used in the derivation . hence these descendant recursion relations will also fail to determine the @xmath131 for the same set of @xmath103 as the principal recursion relation ( and may fail for other @xmath103 as well ) .    however , there are two independent principal singular vectors in the @xmath21-verma module @xmath393 , so we should be able to derive two independent principal recurrence relations ( we have already compared the solutions of these for @xmath154 in table  [ tabm34rec ] ) . at the level of the common denominator of the coefficients of these relations , swapping between the principal singular vectors",
    "merely amounts to swapping @xmath183 and @xmath6 . assuming the conjecture ( [ eqnconjcoeff ] )",
    ", we may therefore ask if there are @xmath131 ( with @xmath108 ) which are not determined by either principal recurrence relation .",
    "numerical studies suggest , and found that no such @xmath103 exist when @xmath486 . ]",
    "that the answer is `` no '' : the @xmath131 , and hence the operator product expansion of @xmath115 with itself , may always be computed from these two principal recurrence relations .",
    "however , we have not been able to construct a proof of this claim .    finally , we mention an intriguing reformulation of our conjectured expression ( [ eqnconjcoeff ] ) for the common denominator of the principal recurrence relation derived from the principal singular vector at grade @xmath190 .",
    "we can express this singular vector in the form @xmath487 where @xmath488 is the set of partitions @xmath489 of @xmath43 , and the @xmath490 are unknown ( rational ) coefficients .",
    "we can follow the derivation of the corresponding recursion relation , only keeping track of the coefficient of the term in which all virasoro modes are removed by commutation with the @xmath59-mode .",
    "this coefficient defines the common denominator of the recursion relation , so our conjecture for this implies that @xmath491 } = \\prod_{k = 1}^{p'-1 } \\bigl [ k { \\left ( k - 1 \\right ) } p - p ' { \\left ( j + k - 1 \\right ) } \\bigr],\\ ] ] where @xmath492 ( and the @xmath490 are appropriately normalised ) .    we have not tried to prove this formula , but it has been checked up to @xmath493 ( for all @xmath6 ) .",
    "it seems amazing to us that the coefficients of the singular vector should satisfy such a nice relation  indeed , for @xmath494 , this relation completely determines the coefficients @xmath490 ( up to an overall normalisation ) .",
    "one can of course substitute in explicit expressions @xcite for the singular vector coefficients , leading to bemusing identities of considerable complexity .",
    "we will not attempt to analyse these here , but it would be very interesting to try to understand these observations at a deeper level .      as remarked at the end of section  [ secgensingvect ] , it is well - established ( though difficult to prove ) that the chiral spectrum of a rational conformal field theory is to a large extent controlled by the singular vectors of the vacuum module ( with respect to the chiral symmetry algebra ) .",
    "for example , @xmath154 has a principal singular vector @xmath413 in its vacuum @xmath21-module @xmath495 at grade @xmath153 .",
    "the corresponding field @xmath414 is therefore null , hence its modes @xmath425 must map _ any _ state of the theory into a singular state . by computing the action of @xmath415 on an arbitrary highest weight state , one finds that the result is singular ( in fact vanishing ) if and only if the dimension of the highest weight state is @xmath128 , @xmath361 or @xmath496 .    in this way",
    ", the principal vacuum singular vector determines the chiral spectrum of the theory .",
    "we ask the obvious question of whether this property is preserved in the extended theories : do the principal singular vectors of the simple current module also determine the spectrum of the ( extended ) theory ? we have seen in section  [ secoperecursive ] that ( at least for the ising model ) these singular vectors already `` know about '' the vacuum singular vector , so we expect that the answer to our question is `` yes '' .",
    "this may indeed be demonstrated in simple cases .",
    "we suppose that @xmath202 is a ( virasoro ) highest weight state of monodromy charge @xmath206 and conformal dimension @xmath497 . in an @xmath11 model , the singular vector ( [ eqnm3pfirstsv ] )",
    "defines a null field @xmath414 ( vanishing in the extended theory ) whose modes have the form @xmath498 we may therefore calculate @xmath499 } \\phi_{\\theta - h } { \\bigl\\lvert \\psi \\bigr\\rangle}. \\end{split}\\ ] ] as @xmath500 , this gives a simple relation between the charge and dimension of any highest weight state in an @xmath11 model : @xmath501    clearly , this does not completely determine the spectrum of the theory spectrum is completely determined by this constraint _ and _ by requiring that the charge be an integer or half - integer between @xmath128 and @xmath65 .",
    "however , this complete determination is a peculiarity of the @xmath11 models . in general , some of these charges will also be forbidden . ] .",
    "what is needed is a second relation between the charge and dimension , and this is provided by the second principal singular vector . as an example , in the ising model ( @xmath278 ) , this second relation is easily verified to be @xmath502 solving the two spectrum - constraining relations then gives @xmath503 and @xmath504 ( respectively ) , as expected .",
    "of course , this analysis can be repeated for other models and other singular vectors , with similar results .",
    "we restrict ourselves to a final remark .",
    "it is possible to show explicitly ( for example with @xmath252 ) that the constraints derived from the principal singular vectors select all fields from the kac table , and _ not _ just those which contribute to the d - type modular invariant .",
    "we would like to thank matthias gaberdiel and antun milas for interesting correspondence during the preparation of this article , and patrick jacob for useful discussions .",
    "we also benefited greatly from the reviewer s comments regarding the modules corresponding to fixed points of the simple current , and thank them for their detailed observations .",
    "this research is supported by nserc .",
    "in this appendix ( which is a continuation of section  [ seccftequivs ] ) , we illustrate fully the process of deriving a conformal field theory equivalence by constructing an isomorphism of chiral algebras .",

    "this is a field of conformal dimension @xmath7 whose operator product expansion with itself is easily read off from the operator product expansions ( [ eqnopett ] ) , ( [ eqnopeprimary ] ) and ( [ eqnope3,10 ] ) .",
    "it can be verified that this linear combination again defines a virasoro field ( that is , the _ four _ singular terms of the operator product expansion have the form of those in ( [ eqnopett ] ) ) if and only if @xmath514 we define @xmath515 and note that these virasoro fields @xmath516 correspond to a central charge of @xmath517 ( which in turn corresponds to the minimal model @xmath152 ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath518 has no singular terms , as is readily checked , so the corresponding virasoro algebras are independent .",
    "we have therefore constructed an isomorphism of algebras : @xmath519 the superscript @xmath520 reminds us that this algebra is defined by the generalised commutation relations with @xmath204 ( only the singular terms of the operator product expansions have been used in the construction of this isomorphism ) .",
    "it is important to note that the virasoro modes @xmath521 corresponding to the fields @xmath516 are only defined to act on states of integral monodromy charge ( so @xmath23 ) .",
