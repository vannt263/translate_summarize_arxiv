    "ultracold atomic gases  @xcite open up new frontiers in the study of non - equilibrium dynamics of strongly interacting quantum systems .",
    "in contrast to electronic systems , the fermi energy in quantum gases is of the order of a few kilohertz , so that questions about metastability and equilibration in quantum systems can now be explored in real time in the laboratory .",
    "exploring these new regimes and developing new theoretical tools to gain insight into the non - equilibrium dynamics of many - body systems is an exciting challenge at the intersection of condensed matter and atomic - molecular - optical physics .    the recent experiment of ref",
    ".  @xcite offers a beautiful example of non - equilibrium dynamics that is completely unexpected and , at first sight , counterintuitive .",
    "two clouds of ultracold fermions prepared in different hyperfine - zeeman (  spin \" ) states @xmath0 and @xmath1 are initially separated using a stern - gerlach field ; see fig .",
    "[ schematicfig ] .",
    "once the field is turned off , the clouds are impelled together by the confining harmonic potential and they collide . in the strongly interacting unitary regime",
    "these very dilute clouds are observed to bounce off each other , almost as if they were colliding billiard balls ! this is truly remarkable in view of the fact that the underlying atomic interaction is _ attractive _ , and the equilibrium ground state is known to be a paired superfluid .",
    "why then do the clouds behave as though the interactions are repulsive ?    two additional aspects of ref .",
    "@xcite are also noteworthy .",
    "once the short - time bounce is damped out , the centers of mass of the clouds remain separated for a considerable duration at intermediate times ( @xmath2 ms ) , before eventually merging . in fact , the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite focused on precisely the slow merging of the clouds , or spin diffusion , at long times ( @xmath3 s ) .",
    "finally , the observed dynamics changes qualitatively as one moves out of the strongly interacting regime , with the clouds merging rapidly for weak interactions .    in this paper we gain insight into three aspects of this remarkable dynamics using a hydrodynamic approach in the strongly interacting regime .",
    "( 1 ) we explain why the clouds repeatedly bounce off each other at short times . ( 2 ) we also explain why the centers of mass of the two clouds remain separated at intermediate time scales .",
    "we show that these results are natural consequences of a metastable many - body state on the  upper branch \" of the feshbach resonance where the effective interactions are repulsive  @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) finally , we provide insight into how the dynamics changes as a function of the strength of the interaction .",
    "our analysis is based on two hypotheses : ( i ) the collisions between atoms are sufficiently rapid to establish local thermodynamic equilibrium when the clouds overlap .",
    "( ii ) the loss from the upper branch scattering state is slow in the experiment of ref .  @xcite . at unitarity ,",
    "the two - body collision rate is very large , @xmath4 ( with @xmath5 ) , for a range of temperatures @xmath6  @xcite . with a fermi energy @xmath7hz and an axial trap frequency @xmath8hz  @xcite",
    ", the gas in the overlap region of the clouds will reach local thermodynamic equilibrium within @xmath9 trap periods .",
    "thus the clouds behave hydrodynamically in the overlap region  @xcite and their dynamics reflect the ( metastable ) equation of state of the gas .",
    "( hydrodynamics also describes well the very different behavior observed in colliding clouds of _ spin - balanced _",
    "superfluid gases at unitarity  @xcite . )",
    "as the two clouds come together in the overlap region , the atoms are initially in scattering states , and the formation of two - body spin - singlet bound states requires three - body collisions in order to satisfy kinematic constraints .",
    "the time scale @xmath10 for such processes is not well understood for strongly interacting gases , however , there are indications that it is enhanced close to unitarity  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the @xmath10 relevant to ref .",
    "@xcite is further enhanced relative to the microscopic decay time since three - body collisions are limited to a small overlap region for a fraction of the oscillation period @xmath11 .",
    "now , for the experimentally relevant time interval @xmath12 , the rapid two - body collisions have already established thermal equilibrium , while the slow three - body recombination process has yet to drive the system into the lower branch .",
    "this allows us to model the cloud dynamics using euler s equations + = - ( + v _ ) - _ , [ euler ] + ( n _ _ ) = 0,[continuity ] with an appropriate energy density @xmath13 $ ] for the scattering states ( see below ) . here",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are the velocity and density of the @xmath16 fermions , @xmath17 is the trap potential .",
    "we include a phenomenological @xmath18 to account for strong spin - current damping in the hydrodynamic regime  @xcite .",
    "viscosity , describing the damping of in - phase current ( @xmath19 ) , is ignored since the motion of the colliding clouds is primarily out - of - phase  @xcite .    as a result of tight confinement in the radial direction ,",
    "the two modes with the lowest energies are the spin - dipole mode and axial breathing mode .",
    "hence , we concentrate on the centers - of - mass of the clouds and their widths along the @xmath20-direction and reformulate ( [ euler ] ) and ( [ continuity ] ) in terms of those variables . using the notation @xmath21 , we define the center - of - mass positions @xmath22 and widths @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath24 ensures that @xmath25 coincides with the axial thomas - fermi ( tf ) radius @xmath26 in equilibrium .",
    "( [ euler ] ) and ( [ continuity ] ) then lead to the exact equations of motion _ + ^2_z 0 & = & -_z(/n _ ) _ - v_z _ + & & + _ v_z - _ z v^2_/2_[zm]and & & + & & -(z-0 ) _",

[ dzm ]    the problem can be further simplified while still retaining the essential physics of the ( nonlinear ) coupling between the spin - dipole and axial breathing modes by using a tf ansatz : n_(,t ) = ^3/2,[ansatz]where @xmath27 is the tf radius along the @xmath28-axis and @xmath29 is the chemical potential of an ideal two - component fermi gas ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "this ansatz allows for a time - dependent center - of - mass @xmath31 as well as axial compression of the clouds . the continuity equation ( [ continuity ] )",
    "leads to the velocity field @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "axial and radial symmetry lets us set @xmath34 and @xmath35 . using ( [ ansatz ] ) in ( [ zm ] ) and ( [ dzm ] ) gives the coupled nonlinear integro - differential equations : ( + ^2_z)|z(t ) = -d^3r - v__[barz],and ( + ^2_z)z(t ) & = & -d^3r + & & - ( z-|z(t))v__.[deltaz ]    in the unitarity regime , the spin - current damping  @xcite assumes a particularly simple form when the relative velocity is of order of the fermi velocity , as is the case at early times for two clouds initially separated by @xmath26 . in the overlap region",
    ", we take = , where @xmath36 is of order unity at unitarity and @xmath37 is the local fermi energy .",
    "this simple choice of damping is , if anything , an overestimate , and we have checked that our results are robust against reasonable modification of the damping parameter .",
    "we now need to specify the energy functional @xmath38 $ ] relevant for dynamics at times @xmath12 .",
    "the ground state ( `` lower branch '' of the feshbach resonance ) for scattering length @xmath39 necessarily involves bound pairs .",
    "but for @xmath40 , the three - body processes required to relax to this state have not yet occurred .",
    "the system has , however , developed two - body correlations characteristic of the metastable  upper branch \" state , studied theoretically in refs .",

    "the effective repulsion between @xmath43 and @xmath44 atoms in the upper branch is crucially related to the node in @xmath42 , in contrast to the nodeless jastrow factor for the lower branch . for small @xmath45 ,",
    "the node occurs at @xmath46 , with @xmath47 similar to the two - body problem . for large @xmath46 , the node saturates  @xcite to @xmath48 , the only length scale at unitarity .",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) studies  @xcite of the upper - branch wavefunction ( [ jastrow ] ) reveal that the system undergoes ( ferromagnetic ) phase separation for sufficiently strong interactions @xmath49 .",
    "we need @xmath38 $ ] for arbitrary polarization , which has not been studied by qmc .",
    "we thus use the lowest order constraint variational ( locv ) approximation  @xcite , which has been used for the upper branch  @xcite and is in close agreement with qmc data  @xcite . as shown in the appendix ,",

    "hydrodynamics requires @xmath54  @xcite ; for simplicity , we use the zero temperature locv energy functional to study the dynamics , expecting it to qualitatively describe the physics at low temperatures .",
    "it is important to note here that while we rely on the approximate locv calculation to obtain the equation of state , the underlying physics of the effective repulsive interaction is independent of the particular scheme used and a more precise calculation would only leads to quantitative improvement without changing the crucial physical picture of the bounce .",
    "we solve ( [ barz ] ) and ( [ deltaz ] ) , using ( [ elocv ] ) and ( [ ansatz ] ) ; for details see appendix  [ appendixnumerical ] .",
    "the results at unitarity are shown in fig .",
    "[ upperbouncefig ] .",
    "the two clouds bounce off each other for several oscillations due to the repulsive nature of the upper branch functional .",
    "the period of the initial bounce is roughly @xmath55 , slightly less than the experimental value @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "we attribute this difference to the simple ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) used to model the dynamics .",
    "the bounce persists for several cycles in spite of the very large damping ( @xmath57 ) because the overlap between the two clouds is small .",
    "once the oscillation is damped out , the centers of mass of the two clouds remain segregated , with a final @xmath58 times the initial separation .",
    "this intermediate time behavior reflects the tendency for system to phase segregate in the upper branch at unitarity .",
    "away from unitarity , it is harder to reach the hydrodynamic regime .",
