    "the finding of pulsars in the sixties was one of the most astonishing discoveries in astrophysics@xcite . soon after their observation they were identified with neutron stars@xcite ,",
    "whose existence had been theoretically predicted decades before .",
    "neutron stars are the densest , most rapidly rotating , and most strongly magnetized objects in the galaxy , features well understood by the standard physics of gravitational and elementary particle physics@xcite .",
    "they are unique laboratories , which give us access to extreme conditions that are virtually impossible to obtain on earth .",
    "neutron stars are of particular interest for neutrino physics because of the key role that these particles play in the very first stages of their formation@xcite .",
    "there is a remarkable characteristic of pulsars not satisfactorily understood : their large drift velocities with respect to nearby stars .",
    "the average value of pulsar velocities is in the range of @xmath4 , an order of magnitude larger than the mean velocity of ordinary stars in our galaxy ( @xmath5)@xcite .",
    "in addition , the distribution of these velocities is not gaussian .",
    "it seems to have a bimodal structure@xcite , with a significant fraction ( @xmath6 ) of the pulsar population having velocities higher than @xmath7 and up to a maximum of @xmath8 .",
    "neutron stars are formed in type - ii supernova explosions and , given the enormous energy liberated during these processes , it is quite natural to look for an explanation in terms of an impulse or _ kick _ received during their birth .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by recent analysis of individual pulsar motions and of associations between supernovae remnants and pulsars .",
    "it is also consistent with observed characteristics of binary systems with one or both constituents being a neutron star@xcite . despite this evidence ,",
    "the physical origin of the kick is one of the most important unsolved puzzles in supernovae research .",
    "if the distribution is bimodal , then more than one mechanism could be responsible for the natal kicks .",
    "two classes of mechanism have been considered@xcite .",
    "one of them invokes an asymmetric mass ejection during the supernova explosion as the result of hydrodynamic perturbations caused by global density inhomogeneities prior to the core collapse@xcite or convective instabilities in the neutrino - heated layer behind the shock@xcite .",
    "recoil speeds as high as @xmath9 have been obtained with two - dimensional simulations . however , a recent three - dimensional calculation shows that even the most extreme asymmetric collapse does not produce final neutron star velocities above @xmath10@xcite , rendering the situation unclear .",
    "only a small fraction of the gravitational binding energy ( @xmath11 ) liberated during a supernova explosion is required to account for the huge electromagnetic luminosity observed and the ejection of the envelope .",
    "more than @xmath12 of the energy is released in the form of neutrinos , which are copiously produced when the iron core turns into a neutron core .",
    "a small asymmetry ( @xmath13 ) in the momentum taken away by neutrinos should be enough to give the nascent pulsar an acceleration consistent with the measured velocities .",
    "the asymmetric neutrino emission induced by strong magnetic fields is the basis of the second class of kick mechanisms , and effects such as parity violation@xcite , asymmetric field distributions@xcite , and dark spots@xcite have been considered in this context .",
    "the density in the interior of a protoneutron star is so high , of the order of the nuclear density , that even neutrinos remain trapped , being emitted from an approximately well defined surface , the neutrinosphere . in a magnetized stellar plasma",
    "there are anisotropic contributions to the neutrino refraction index@xcite and , as a consequence , the resonant flavor transformations of neutrinos diffusing in different directions respect to the magnetic field occur at different depths within the protostar . this phenomenon can induce a momentum flux asymmetry and is the basis of the neutrino - driven kick mechanism proposed by kusenko and segr ( ks)@xcite . with standard ( active ) neutrinos the mechanism works when the resonance region lies between the @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( or @xmath16 ) neutrinospheres , but requires an exceedingly high square mass difference , in conflict with the existing limits .",
    "a variant avoiding such a limitation can be implemented in terms of active - sterile neutrino oscillation@xcite .",
    "the measurement of the z - boson width at lep , limiting to three the number of light neutrinos having weak interactions , does not preclude the existence of additional neutral fermions that do not fill the standard model gauge interactions .",
    "they have been invoked to explain several questions in astronomy and cosmology and may becomes a necessity if the claimed lsnd evidence for oscillations were confirmed .",
    "the range of the oscillation parameters ( mass and mixing angle ) required by the pulsar kick mechanism overlaps with the allowed region for sterile neutrinos being candidates to cosmological dark matter .",
    "alternative kick mechanisms driven by neutrino oscillations have been proposed invoking the possible existence of transition magnetic moments@xcite , non orthonormality of the flavor neutrinos@xcite , violations of the equivalence principle@xcite , or off - resonant emission of sterile neutrinos@xcite .    in this article",
    "we review the explanation of the pulsar kick in terms of the resonant neutrino oscillations . in section",
    "ii , we outline the creation of a protoneutron star as a result of a supernova event , and the formation in its interior of a gas of trapped neutrinos . the momentum flux carried by neutrinos",
    "is analyzed in section iii .",
    "section iv is devoted to the discussion of the neutrino oscillations in matter incorporating the effect of strong magnetic fields .",
    "the implication of this phenomenon as source of the asymmetry in the momentum flux transported by neutrinos emitted during the protoneutron star cooling is examined in section v. numerical results are obtained in section vi within the context of the eddington model , where the kick effect is explicitly evaluated . in the final section we summarize the outstanding features of the mechanism .",
    "neutron stars are extremely compact objects born in type ii supernova explosions@xcite , as the aftermath of the gravitational collapse of a massive star ( @xmath17 when it exhausts the sources of thermonuclear energy and its iron core reaches the chandrasekhar limit , @xmath18 .",
    "the process is triggered by the photodissociation of iron nuclei , @xmath19mev , which consumes energy reducing the pressure of the degenerated electron gas .",
    "when the collapse proceeds , pressure support decreases because of the electron capture by nuclei .",
    "electron neutrinos are copiously produced through the reaction @xmath20 and initially they freely escape from the core , but as density increases the medium becomes less transparent for them .",
    "the inner core ( @xmath21 ) collapses in a homologous way at a subsonic velocity proportional to the radius ( @xmath22 , with the density and temperature profiles remaining similar and only the scale changing with time@xcite .",
    "the external shells collapse at a supersonic velocity of the order of free fall velocity ( @xmath23 ) .    during the first part of the collapse the main source of opacity for neutrinos is the coherent scattering by heavy nuclei , mediated by the neutral current weak interaction .",
    "the cross section for this reaction is proportional to @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the number of nucleons in the nuclei , and is very effective in trapping neutrinos@xcite .",
    "if @xmath26 is the mean free path of neutrinos , then the time for them to diffuse out of the core , estimated from a random walk through a distance of the order of the core radius @xmath27 , is @xmath28 . on the other hand ,",
    "the core dynamical time scale is of the order of the free fall time @xmath29 . at a certain density , of about @xmath30 for 10 mev neutrinos ,",
    "both times become comparable and neutrinos are trapped@xcite .",
    "@xmath31-equilibrium between @xmath32 and @xmath14 is set up and electron neutrinos also become degenerated . in this way ,",
    "the collapsing core is the only place , besides the early universe , where neutrinos are in thermal equilibrium . during the collapse",
    "the lepton fraction @xmath33 is kept almost constant near the value of the electron fraction at the beginning of the trapping ( @xmath34 ) , with only @xmath35 corresponding to neutrinos@xcite .",
    "the degenerate gas of trapped neutrinos diffuses towards the exterior , reaching regions of decreasing density where the collisions are less frequent , until they finally decouple from the star .",
    "although this process is continuous , it is convenient to introduce an effective emission surface called the neutrinosphere , characterized as the surface where the optical depth becomes approximately one .",
    "more accurately , the radius of the neutrinosphere @xmath36 is defined by the condition @xmath37 the medium is considered opaque for neutrinos inside the neutrinosphere and transparent outside .",
    "we can also define the energy sphere , where the energy exchanging reactions freeze out while energy conserving collisions may still be important .",
    "the collapse stops suddenly when , after a fraction of seconds , densities of around @xmath38 , exceeding nuclear density , are reached@xcite .",
    "then , a shock wave is built up near the interface of the halted inner core and the supersonically free falling outer part .",
    "the shock wave propagates outwards and eventually ejects the stellar mantle of the star . at its passage through the neutrinosphere nuclei",
    "are dissociated decreasing the neutrino opacity and causing a recession of the neutrinosphere .",
    "the @xmath14 produced by the reaction @xmath39 can escape freely building up a short ( @xmath4010msec ) @xmath14 burst , called the  neutronization burst \" or  deleptonization burst \" .",
    "the star remnant gravitationally decouples from the expanding ejecta and a protoneutron star has been formed@xcite .",
    "the neutrinos continue trapped due to the interaction with the residual particles of the medium , mainly nucleons , electrons , and neutrinos . for @xmath14",
    "the dominant reactions are the @xmath31 and @xmath31-inverse , which mantain them in local thermodynamical equilibrium@xcite . in this case",
    ", the distinction between neutrinosphere and energy sphere is not crucial .",
    "the electron neutrinos also interact with nucleons through the neutral current , but the cross sections for these reactions are smaller .",
    "although the energy dependence of the process involving @xmath14 and @xmath41 is the same , in a protoneutron star the number of neutrons is larger than the number of protons , and therefore the @xmath14 suffer more collisions than the @xmath41 . as a consequence ,",
    "the neutrinosphere of the @xmath14 is a bit further out than the one of the @xmath41 , and the mean energy per emitted particle is smaller .",
    "after the achievement of @xmath31 equilibrium , the total entropy is conserved and the collapse becomes adiabatic .    in the case of the nonelectron ( active )",
    "neutrinos and antineutrinos , the absence of muons and taus does not allow the establishment of chemical equilibrium with the stellar plasma .",
    "therefore , they do not transport leptonic number outside the star and their chemical potentials vanish .",
    "their interactions with the background are the same and no distinction needs to be made between @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "deeper in the protostar the main interactions for these neutrinos are pair processes such as @xmath42 , etc , where @xmath43 denotes a nucleon , and the scattering reactions with nucleons and electrons .",
    "the scattering on electrons are less frequent , but the energy transferred is greater .",
    "this process dominates the energy exchange up to the energy sphere where it freezes out . beyond this radius , muon and tau neutrinos still scatter off neutrons until they reach the neutrinosphere .",
    "the cross section for @xmath44 is smaller than the one of the @xmath31 reaction , and hence the radius of the muon ( tau ) neutrinosphere @xmath45 is shorter than the radius of the electron neutrinosphere @xmath46 .",
    "the protoneutron star contracts , cools , and deleptonizes due to the emission of neutrinos and antineutrinos of all the flavors in a scale of time of the order of 10 sec .",
    "the released energy is equally shared by all neutrino and antineutrino species .",
    "this phase is known as the kelving - helmholtz phase and ends up in the formation of a neutron star . during this time the radius of the protostar varies from around @xmath47 to @xmath48 , while the mass remains of the order of @xmath49 .",
    "after approximately @xmath50 minute the neutrino mean free path becomes comparable to the stellar radius and neutrino luminosity decreases quickly .",
    "another important property predicted for neutron stars is that they should have an extremely strong magnetic field .",
    "since the conductivity of the iron core is very large , the magnetic flux is essentially trapped and it is conserved as it collapses to form a neutron star@xcite . adopting for the initial magnetic field",
    "the typical values observed in some white dwarfs , from the flux conservation one can easily estimate that the surface field of a protoneutron star has to be in the range of @xmath51 .",
    "this is supported by evidence inferred from measurements of the spin - down rates and observations of the x - ray spectra features@xcite .",
    "magnetic fields of the order of @xmath52 or stronger can be generated by dynamo processes , and in the central regions intensities up to @xmath53 have been considered@xcite .",
    "in a protoneutron star the momentum flux from the core to the external regions is dominated by neutrinos , which provide the most efficient mechanism to release the energy generated during stellar collapse . as explained in the previous section ,",
    "matter densities are so high that neutrinos are trapped forming a degenerated gas at quasi - equilibrium diffusing radially .",
    "the statistical description of this gas is made in terms of a distribution function @xmath54 .",
    "if the action of external fields is negligible , then the neutrino momentum between two consecutive collisions remains constant .",
    "the change of the distribution function is due to neutrino collisions with the particles in the medium and is described by the boltzmann equation @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the collision integral and @xmath57    when the regime is close to equilibrium we can approximate the collision integral as follows @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the average time between collisions and @xmath60 is the fermi - dirac distribution function for the gas of relativistic neutrinos ( @xmath61 ) with chemical potential @xmath62 and temperature @xmath63 . in the static situation ( @xmath64 ) ,",
    "( [ boltz ] ) with @xmath65 ) given by eq .",
    "( [ zz ] ) can be solved iteratively . proceeding in this way we obtain @xmath66 which constitutes the diffusion approximation for the distribution function .",
    "the second term in this expression gives the correction to equilibrium and allows the transport of the energy and momentum towards the exterior of the protostar .",

    "the neutral current reactions equally affect all flavors .",
    "since the energies available in the system are much smaller than the mass of the @xmath81 lepton , the @xmath16 does not participate in the charge - current interactions .",
    "for the same reason , and for simplicity , we also ignore the presence of muons .",

    "a notable consequence of neutrino mixing is the phenomena of neutrino oscillations established five decades ago by pontecorvo@xcite .",
    "it corresponds to the periodic variation in the flavor content of a neutrino beam as it evolves from the production point . in the last years",
    "compelling evidence of neutrino oscillations has been obtained in experiments with atmospheric , solar , accelerator , and reactor neutrinos@xcite .",
    "the most plausible interpretation for these new phenomena is that neutrinos are massive particles and the weak - interaction states @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) are linear combinations of the mass eigenstates @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) , with masses @xmath107 : @xmath108 where @xmath109 are the elements of a unitary mixing matrix , the analogue of the ckm matrix in the quark sector .",

    "the neutrino beam will not correspond to pure @xmath116 but turns partially into other flavors .",
    "the pattern of neutrino oscillations is modified when neutrinos propagate through a material medium .",
    "the basic reason is that the energy - momentum relation of an active neutrino is affected by its coherent interactions with the particles that constitute the medium .",
    "these modifications are described in terms of a potential energy @xmath117 , which is related to the real part of the refraction index @xmath118 according to @xmath119 and can be calculated from the background contributions to the neutrino self - energy@xcite . if , like in normal matter , electrons but not heavier leptons are present in the background , then only @xmath14 scatter through charge current interactions , while all the flavors interact via the neutral current .",
    "therefore , the refraction index differs for neutrinos of different flavors and they will acquire distinct phases when propagating with the same momentum through the medium .",
    "this fact can have impressive consequences in the case of mixed neutrinos and , under favorable conditions , flavor transformations are significantly enhanced in a medium with a varying density even when mixing in vacuum is small .",
    "this is the essence of the msw mechanism@xcite whose large mixing realization provides the solution to the solar neutrino problem@xcite .    besides the modifications of the dispersion relation , neutrinos acquire in matter an effective coupling to the electromagnetic field by means of their weak interaction with the background particles@xcite . as a result ,",
    "in the presence of an external magnetic field there are additional contributions to the neutrino refraction index and flavor transformations are affected , but in a way that preserves quirality@xcite , contrary to what happens for neutrino oscillations driven by transition magnetic moments@xcite . in what follows , we will discuss neutrino oscillations in a magnetized medium for the simplest situation of mixing between two neutrino species , that is , @xmath116 and another active neutrino @xmath120 or a hypothetical sterile neutrino @xmath121 . in any case",

    "<S> pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars and are the outcome of the collapse of the core of a massive star with a mass of the order of or larger than eight solar masses . </S>",
    "<S> this process releases a huge gravitational energy of about @xmath0 , mainly in the form of neutrinos . during the collapse </S>",
    "<S> the density increases , and so does the magnetic field due to the trapping of the flux lines of the progenitor star by the high conductivity plasma . when the density reaches a value of around @xmath1 neutrinos become trapped within the protoneutron star and a neutrinosphere , characterized inside by a diffusive transport of neutrinos and outside by a free streaming of neutrinos , is formed and lasts for a few seconds </S>",
    "<S> here we focus on the structure of the neutrinosphere , the resonant flavor conversion that can happen in its interior , and the neutrino flux anisotropies induced by this phenomena in the presence of a strong magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we present a detailed discussion in the context of the spherical eddington model , which provides a simple but reasonable description of a static neutrino atmosphere , locally homogenous and isotropic . energy and momentum are transported by neutrinos and antineutrinos flowing through an ideal gas of nonrelativistic , nondegenerate nucleons and relativistic , degenerate electrons and positrons . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the details of the asymmetric neutrino emission driven by active - sterile neutrino oscillations in the magnetized protoneutron star , and the possibility for this mechanism to explain the intrinsic large velocities of pulsars respect to nearby stars and associated supernova remnants .    </S>",
