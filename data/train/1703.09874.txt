    "moreover , the rapid decline at @xmath95 2.5 further reflects that at these redshifts , the _ u_-band filter begins to sample well below ly@xmath96 and the 912@xmath41 lyman limit , where very few objects emit any significant light ( e.g. mostardi et al . 2013 , smith et al .",

    "to try to minimize the impact of these larger fwhm images while preserving image depth , we next combined the images while taking into account a weight - factor based on the fwhm of _ each individual _ image .",
    "the weight - map for each image was multiplied by the inverse square of the fwhm in arcseconds ( i.e. , @xmath97fwhm@xmath98 ) . an image with a fwhm of @xmath99",

    "this shows that when combining data of widely varying seeing fwhm - values  as is usually the case in ground - based image stacking  proper weighting needs to be applied to each image seeing .     and the deepest mosaic ( red ) including all images with fwhm @xmath2 . for the optimal - resolution and optimal - depth mosaics ,",

    "the weighted image detects more objects .",
    "[ figure : numcntswht ] ]      we selected the 220 brightest ( ab@xmath6 23 mag ) and most extended galaxies , and measured their azimuthally averaged radial surface brightness ( sb ) profiles for both the optimal - resolution and the lower - resolution stacks .",
    "the majority of the galaxy sample are face - on and edge - on spirals , and the remainder are mostly early - type galaxies .",
    "we did so using a custom idl procedure ` galprof ` written by one of us ( raj ) , which performs surface photometry within a set of growing elliptical annuli .",

    "this offset is only 0.05 mag and may be due to over - subtraction of the background in the optimal - depth mosaic . to test our results from ` galprof ` , we made model galaxies with sersic profiles and varied input parameters to match the variety of galaxies in our 220 sample and measured them using ` galprof ` .",

    "they argue that this discrepancy could be due to foreground light sources ( zodiacal light and the milky way galaxy ) possibly not having been fully subtracted from the direct ebl measurements , so that the iebl method that uses the galaxy number - counts may be seeing most of the real ebl . our uniquely deep lbt _",
    "u_-band imaging allows us to determine if the driver et al .",
    "( 2016 ) results could still be underestimating the true ebl from the integrated galaxy counts , due to significant missing light hiding in the low - surface brightness outskirts of galaxies ( dwek & krennrich 2013 and references therein ) .    in this exercise ,",
    "we only look at the brightest galaxies , because they dominate the ebl total energy budget in the universe at @xmath23 @xmath82023 mag , simply because in the optical the largest change in count - slope occurs in this flux range , from non - converging at brighter magnitudes to well converging at much fainter magnitudes ( windhorst et al .",

    "2016 ) . as a consequence ,",

    "there appears to be not enough low - surface brightness emission in the outskirts of the brighter galaxies to explain the large ( factor 35 ) difference between the two methods of computing the ebl .",
    "hence , it is unlikely that the blue iebl derived from the integrated counts is missing a large amount of low - sb emission in galaxy out - skirts .",
    "[ figure : sbp ] simply shows that an insufficient amount of light is hiding ( in the _",

    "one caveat is that we can only do this currently in the u - band , because this is the lbt filter for which we have a largest number of exposures available that cover a wide range in seeing .",
    "redder filters would be more sensitive to any missing galaxy bulge or halo - light .",
    "another caveat is that our study can not constrain or rule out truly diffuse sources of ebl as a possible cause of the above discrepancy .",
    "such sources are , e.g. , inter - group or inter - cluster light , or truly unresolved intergalactic populations , which possibilities are discussed in driver et al .",
