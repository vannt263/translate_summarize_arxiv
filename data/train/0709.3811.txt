    "ising magnets and their variants have been simulated for opinion dynamics @xcite , urban segregation @xcite , economics @xcite , language change @xcite @xmath6 , sometimes even at zero temperature . in the latter case",
    ", each spin = @xmath7 aligns in the direction of the majority of its neighbours ; if the neighbourhood is evenly divided we orient the spin randomly ( glauber kinetics ) . starting from a random distribution one does not always end up with all spins parallel ; strip domains may form at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "noise can be introduced into this model also different from the traditional temperature and boltzmann probabilities . at each iteration of a @xmath8 square lattice with four neighbours for each site , besides the above majority rule , we select @xmath1 times randomly a spin and flip it : `` noise '' @xcite .",
    "the probability distribution function @xmath0 of these numbers @xmath1 is taken as a power law , @xmath9    to get this distribution , we determined random numbers @xmath10 , homogeneously distributed between zero and one , and then took @xmath11 @xmath12 for @xmath13 smaller than and equal to one , respectively . here the proportionality factor @xmath14 determines the amplitude of the noise , analogously to the temperature in boltzmann statistics",

    "first we look at the special case @xmath15 of eq.(2b ) .",
    "fig.1 shows the summed magnetisation @xmath16 versus time to relax exponentially towards zero at @xmath17 , when we started with all spins up . for smaller @xmath14",
    "the magnetisation remains positive , fig.2 .",
    "fig.3 shows its normalized averages over the second half of the simulation .",
    "however , these averages over many samples and/or time steps do not tell the full story .",
    "fig.4 shows how the system `` wants '' to recover towards larger magnetisation but crashes back to small values if a particularly large noise @xmath1 happened .",
    "( pictures at @xmath17 show medium - size domains of up spins ; thus if the noise flips a single spin , that spin mostly reverts in the next time step to its old orientation . )",
    "the magnetisation for @xmath14 slightly above its critical value gets closer to zero if we let the noise flip small plaquettes of size @xmath18 instead of merely one spin .",
    "fig.5 compares @xmath19 ( previous method ) with @xmath20 = 3 and 5 . understandably , the critical value of @xmath14 is shifted downwards if each noise event flips a whole plaquette , as also seen in fig.5 .",
    "all figures so far referred to @xmath15 ; for @xmath21 and 0.5 the results were similar , fig.6 .",
    "if for @xmath15 the noise is used with a probability 0.1 only , the magnetisations returned to one , up to @xmath22 ( not shown ) .",
    "if we start with spins randomly oriented up or down and average over the absolute value of the magnetisation , then fig.7 shows a spontaneous magnetisation to emerge after sufficiently long times for low @xmath14 .",
    "finally we determined the histograms of the decision times .",
    "these are the time intervals between two consecutive spin flips ( or opinion changes ) .",
    "fig.8 shows exponential distributions : for higher @xmath14 the decay is faster than for lower @xmath14 , without evidence for critical slowing down .",
    "this kind of decay is due to the noise .",
    "in a first approximation , we look at the effect of a single set of @xmath1 flips .",
    "then we observe two characteristic times of the dynamics .",
    "the first one is connected to the restoring of the ferromagnetic ordering .",
    "it is relatively short if the magnetization is far from zero ; however , it can be arbitrarily long in the opposite case .",
    "the second time is due to the average lifetime of the ordered phase with a given macroscopic direction of the magnetisation .",
    "this time is expected to be proportional to ln@xmath23 ; sooner or later the value of the variable @xmath1 happens to be of the order of magnitude of the whole system . if the magnetization at that time step happens to be large enough , most of flipped spins were + 1 ; therefore in this case the magnetization change is particularly sharp .",
    "this can be observed in an example of the time evolution of @xmath24 , shown in fig.4 . as for each spin",
    "the probability of flipping is @xmath25 , in general case the variation of the magnetization is expected to follow the approximated rule for one iteration ( @xmath1 noise events ) :      where @xmath27 is the number of spins with orientation @xmath28 . in this equation",
    "spins of both orientation are assumed to flip with the same probabilities . as we see , the state @xmath29 is the fixed point of the transformation .",
    "more detailed inspection reveals that the two processes indicated above can not be treated as independent .",
    "the exchange - mediated restoring of the ordered phase is slowed down even by small reductions of @xmath24 caused by the noise .",
    "if the noise intensity is small enough , some kind of dynamic equilibrium can be observed between the noise - induced reduction of @xmath24 and the increase of @xmath24 due to the exchange .",
    "although it is difficult to speak about stationary processes , the observed time average in a not - too - long period of time can be compared to the partially ordered ferromagnetic system in temperature lower than its curie temperature . in this sense , the results allow to state that the investigated phase transition exists also in the presence of the noise @xmath30 . as a by - product of the model",
    "we obtain the fact that any ordered phase has its finite lifetime .",
    "now we speculate about possible social implications of these results .",
    "several physical concepts usually applied in sociophysics have no direct counterparts in social systems ; one of them is temperature . in physics",
    ", it makes sense to speak about temperature in the case of thermal equilibrium . in simulations , temperature measures the amount of noise ; it is relevant to distinguish between the probabilities of states with different energies . in social systems energy",
    "is not defined and the equilibrium state is never attained .",
    "a model society can be considered to be rather in a self - organized critical state @xcite than in any kind of equilibrium @xcite .",
    "a question arises , if results of simulations interpreted within the social sciences persist if the thermal noise is substituted by another kind of noise , designed as to reflect features of the self - organized criticality .",
    "in particular , we have found that some equivalent of the ferro - paramagnetic phase transition persists in the presence of such a noise .",
    "the finite lifetime of any ordered phase can be compared to an average time during which a society supports the government formed by a given party .",
    "the @xmath30 noise in this case can be compared to a series of scandals which reduce the government reputation .",
    "the size of such scandals is not limited from above ; examples are at hand . in sociophysics ,",
    "the phase transition itself is a physical trait . in social sciences",
    "the up - down symmetry does not exist ; there is always some bias .",
    "then , the spontaneous symmetry breaking - the ultimate base of the model - has again no social analogue .",
    "one could say that in sociology , the opposition is not `` plus - minus '' , but rather `` something - nothing '' , related with society or its institutions .",
    "then maybe we should consider the random spins equal to zero (= non - interacting ) or one rather than @xmath28 .",
    "another physical trait is an interaction ; in physics it joins two interacting systems symmetrically , as in the third newton law , actio =  reactio . in social systems",
    "also this symmetry is absent , at least on local time scale .",
    "( one may wonder to what extent the conquest of the latin america had petrified feudal attitude in spanish elites , making the whole country unable to develop -this would be only one example of a restoring of this symmetry . )",
    "these arguments indicate that further improvements of the model picture are needed , with a possible enrichment of the set of tools of the statistical physics .",
    "still , we believe that sociophysics is much too useful to be destroyed in this way . it should rather evolve towards a better science , more elastic in using physical concepts and closer to the social reality .",
    "we are going to reconstruct the society in mathematical models step by step .",
    "the scale - free @xmath30 noise , suggested by the self - organized criticality , is such a modest step towards this goal ."
