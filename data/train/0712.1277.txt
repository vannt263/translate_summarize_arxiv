    "andreev reflection ( ar ) @xcite is the main mechanism of low energy electron transport between a normal metal and a superconductor .",
    "this mechanism results in a number of interesting effects causing , e.g. , a non - zero subgap conductance @xcite of such hybrid structures . in systems with one superconducting ( s ) and several normal ( n ) terminals , e.g. nsn hybrid structures , electrons may suffer andreev reflection at each of ns interfaces .",
    "provided the distance between two ns interfaces @xmath0 strongly exceeds the superconducting coherence length @xmath1 , ar processes at these interfaces are independent .",
    "if , however , the distance @xmath0 becomes comparable with @xmath1 , two additional _ non - local _ processes should be taken into account ( see fig .",
    "firstly , an electron with subgap energy can directly penetrate from one n - metal into another through a superconductor .",
    "since the subgap density of states in the superconductor vanishes , the probability of this process should be suppressed by the factor @xmath2 .",
    "secondly , an electron penetrating into the superconductor from the first n - terminal may form a cooper pair together with another electron from the second n - terminal . in this case",
    "a hole goes into the second n - metal and ar becomes a non - local effect .",
    "the probability of this process  usually called crossed andreev reflection ( car ) @xcite  also decays as @xmath3 and , in combination with direct electron transfer between normal electrodes , determines non - local conductance in hybrid multi - terminal structures .",
    "this non - local conductance can be directly measured in experiments and it has recently become a subject of intensive investigations .",
    "several experiments @xcite allowed to clearly detect the non - local conductance in three - terminal nsn structures and demonstrated a rich variety of different features which unambiguous and detailed interpretation remains an important task for the future . at this point",
    "we note that in addition to car a number of other physical effects may considerably influence the observations . among such effects",
    "we mention , e.g , charge imbalance ( relevant close to the superconducting critical temperature @xcite ) and zero - bias anomalies in the andreev conductance due to both disorder - enhanced interference of electrons @xcite and coulomb effects @xcite .",
    "theoretically car was analyzed within the perturbation theory in the transmission of ns interfaces in refs .",
    "@xcite where it was demonstrated that in the lowest order in the interface barrier transmission and at @xmath4 car contribution to cross - terminal conductance is exactly canceled by that from elastic electron cotunneling ( indicated as ( 1 ) in fig .",
    "1 ) , i.e. the non - local conductance turns out to vanish in this limit .",
    "recently a non - trivial interplay between normal reflection , tunneling , local ar and car in three - terminal ballistic nsn devices was non - perturbatively analyzed to all orders in the interface transmissions @xcite .",
    "this analysis allowed to determine an explicit dependence of the non - local conductance both on the transmissions of ns interfaces and on the length @xmath0 , to set the maximum scale of the effect and to consider various important limits .",
    "the effect of disorder on car was recently studied in refs .",
    "@xcite ( perturbatively in tunneling ) and @xcite ( non - perturbatively in tunneling , for a device with normal terminals attached to a superconductor via an additional normal island ) .",
    "the interplay between car and coulomb interaction effects was recently addressed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is also important to mention that both ar and car should be sensitive to magnetic properties of normal electrodes because these processes essentially depend on spins of scattered electrons .",
    "first experiments on ferromagnet - superconductor - ferromagnet ( fsf ) structures @xcite illustrated this point by demonstrating the dependence of non - local conductance on the polarization of ferromagnetic terminals .",
    "hence , for better understanding of non - local effects in multiterminal hybrid proximity structures it is desirable to construct a theory of _ spin - resolved _ car .",
    "in the lowest order order in tunneling this task was accomplished in ref .",
    "for fsf structures higher orders in the interface transmissions were considered in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are going to generalize our quasiclassical approach @xcite and construct a theory of spin - resolved car to all orders in the interface transmissions . instead of dealing directly with fsf devices we will consider nsn structures with spin - active interfaces .",
    "this model allows to distinguish spin - dependent contributions to the non - local conductance and to effectively mimic the situation of ferromagnetic and/or half - metallic electrodes .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we will introduce our model and discuss the quasiclassical formalism supplemented by the boundary conditions for green - keldysh functions which account for electron scattering at spin - active interfaces .",

    "technical details related to boundary conditions will be outlined in appendix a.",
    "let us consider three - terminal nsn structure depicted in fig .",
    "we will assume that all three metallic electrodes are non - magnetic and ballistic , i.e. the electron elastic mean free path in each metal is larger than any other relevant size scale . in order to resolve spin - dependent effects",
    "we will assume that both ns interfaces are spin - active , i.e. we will distinguish `` spin - up '' and `` spin - down '' transmissions of the first ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) and the second ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) sn interface .",

    "the distance between these interfaces @xmath0 as well as other geometric parameters are assumed to be much larger than @xmath11 , i.e. effectively both contacts are metallic constrictions . in this case",
    "the voltage drops only across sn interfaces and not inside large metallic electrodes .",
    "hence , nonequilibrium ( e.g. charge imbalance ) effects related to the electric field penetration into the s - electrode can be neglected . in what follows",

    "electrons scattered at different barriers may interfere and form bound states ( resonances ) which in general can not be correctly described within the quasiclassical formalism employing zaitsev boundary conditions . in our geometry , however , any relevant trajectory reaches each interface only once whereas the probability of multiple reflections at both interfaces is small in the parameter @xmath54 .",
