    "during the last decade a number of researchers have used atomic - scale microscopy to make quantitative experimental measurements of the terrace width distribution ( twd ) of vicinal surfaces . to understand the data  and , especially , to extract the strength of the interaction between the steps  they have fit the twds with gaussians ( or in cases of no apparent energetic repulsion , with free - fermion distributions ) .",
    "recently there has been a significant improvement in the theoretical understanding of interacting steps on vicinal surfaces : as an example of a fluctuation phenomenon , they should be described by certain universal features related to random - matrix theory . in particular",
    ", the twd should be well describable in terms of a generalized form of the distribution surmised by wigner to describe some special cases of interactions@xcite .",
    "in a recent paper@xcite , hereafter ge , terrace width distributions ( twds ) of various vicinal copper surfaces were analyzed using both the traditional gaussian approach and the generalized wigner surmise .",
    "many conclusions were noted in passing about the relative merits and sensitivities of these two approaches .",
    "the goal of this paper is to provide supporting details together with new results and approaches that should aid in the interpretation and analysis of experimental twds .",
    "we explore the relationship between the wigner form of twds and the gaussian .",
    "we discuss several statistical considerations that should be taken into account .",
    "the many issues treated by this paper arose during the course of analyzing experimental data in ge .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "[ sec - series ] reviews the twd derived from the generalized wigner surmise and presents some practical new approximations derived from series expansions .",
    "in particular , we provide what we believe is the best simple expression [ eq .",
    "( [ e : as ] ) ] to deduce the step - step repulsion strength from the variance of the twd . sec .",
    "[ sec - gausswigner ] deals with the approach of the generalized wigner distribution to the form of the gaussian for strong step - step repulsions .",
    "while this behavior had been recognized earlier , we now characterize it quantitatively . in section  [ sec - normmean ] ,",
    "we contend with a recurring theme in ge : the error generated by uncertainty in the mean of the distribution .",
    "experimentalists had the belief that gaussian fits of data are more forgiving of such errors than are wigner fits .",
    "we study this notion quantitatively by checking for both distributions the effect of perturbations in normalization and in mean by fitting deliberately misnormed or displaced data .",
    "the results of arguably greatest interest to experimentalists are in section  [ sec - wigner2param ] .",
    "we describe a extension of our proposed analysis scheme for twds for which the first moment of the data does not conform well to the apparent mean .",
    "we propose treating the generalized wigner distribution as a _ two - parameter function _ : in addition to the exponent @xmath0 , the value of the effective mean ( which scales the terrace widths ; cf .",
    "[ sec - series ] ) is adjusted simultaneously in the non - linear least - squares fit .",
    "this procedure makes little difference for the `` good '' data reported in ge , but can have significant effect on `` poorer '' data glossed over in that paper .",
    "we present both graphical illustrations and thorough tabulations for the extensive data for vicinal copper discussed in ge .",
    "we also apply the wigner distribution to recently published data for vicinal pt(110 ) .",
    "sections  [ sec - discrete ] and [ sec - sample ] offer a pair of warnings regarding how the discreteness of the terrace widths and the limited size of the sample , respectively , can confound the analysis . in the former case , for the range of interaction strengths found in physical systems ,",
    "discreteness becomes problematic for high misorientations , when the mean terrace width drops to just a few lattice spacings . in the latter case",
    ", we observe that statistical fluctuations due to the typical size might well account for some of the data sets labeled as  poor , \" rather than some system contaminant or measurement flaw .",
    "a conclusion summarizes the current state of our understanding .",
    "as has been discussed extensively before@xcite , a new idea from random - matrix theory@xcite is that fluctuations should exhibit certain universal behavior . according to the so - called wigner surmise",
    ", the distribution of fluctuations can be approximated by@xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 being the terrace width , and the constants @xmath4 and @xmath5 are given by @xmath6 ^ 2 \\nonumber \\\\   & \\approx & \\left(\\frac{\\varrho+1}{2}\\right )        \\left[1 - \\frac{1}{2}(\\varrho+1)^{-1 }               + \\frac{1}{8}(\\varrho+1)^{-2}\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{\\varrho}{2 } + \\frac{1}{4 }               + \\frac{1}{16(\\varrho+1 ) } %          = \\frac{\\varrho}{2 } %             + \\frac{1}{4 } + \\frac{1}{16}(\\varrho+1)^{-1 } \\label{e : br } % the third part of the above equation is never used.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath7^{\\varrho+1 } }                    { \\left[\\gamma \\left(\\frac{\\varrho+1}{2}\\right)\\right]^{\\varrho+2 } } \\ , , \\label{e : abr}\\ ] ] respectively . for brevity , we refer hereafter to this set of formulas as the cgwd ( continuum generalized wigner distribution ) .",
    "the cgwd can be derived in a more transparent fashion from a mean - field approximation@xcite .",
    "the approximate result in eq .",
    "( [ e : br ] ) , derived in appendix a by asymptotic expansion , is new .",
    "it is consistent with eq .",
    "( 9 ) of ge in the neighborhood of @xmath8 ; it is within 0.2% of the exact @xmath4 as calculated using gamma functions at @xmath9 and is within 0.05% of @xmath4 by @xmath10 .",
    "experimentally , a twd is typically characterized by its variance @xmath11 . in principle",
    "@xmath11 might be determined directly from the second moment of the twd , but there is concern that this approach does not adequately minimize noise in the data , an issue we shall revisit in sec .",
    "[ sec - sample ] .",
    "thus , in practice , twds are fit to smooth functions ; gaussians are typically chosen , not just for their simplicity but because their use can be justified readily in the limit of strong elastic repulsion between steps .",
    "the variance of the twd is then approximated by the variance @xmath12 of the fitted gaussian .",
    "we argue here and in ge that the cgwd given in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is scarcely more complicated than a gaussian but provides a better accounting of the variance . for strong step repulsions , the variance of the fitted gaussian is usually not very different from the variance @xmath13 of a cgwd , as is discussed more quantitatively in sec .",
    "[ sec - gausswigner ] . for weak repulsions ,",
    "however , it is well known that the twd becomes too skewed to allow a satisfactory fit to a gaussian .",
    "experimentalists finding themselves in this predicament have been stymied on how to proceed quantitatively @xcite .",
    "significantly , a gaussian fit to a twd with nonnegligible skewness can not even be expected to have the correct mean ; the consequences of this fact are dealt with in much of the remainder of this paper .    for the cgwd , the variance can be expressed simply in terms of @xmath4 .",
    "we can use eq .",
    "( [ e : br ] ) to obtain    @xmath14    for large values of @xmath0 ( e.g.  @xmath11 is overestimated by about 0.5% at @xmath10 but just 0.1% at @xmath15 ) .",
    "the usual goal in an experiment is to extract the magnitude @xmath16 of the elastic repulsion between steps , perpendicular to the step direction , given by @xmath17 .",
    "all standard analysis procedures make a continuum approximation in the direction along the steps ( perpendicular to the  upstairs \" direction ) ; thereafter , @xmath16 appears only in the form of a dimensionless interaction strength @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the step stiffness . in this conceptualization @xmath0",
    "is related to @xmath20 by the equation @xmath21 which follows from mapping this problem onto the sutherland hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "the subscript @xmath22 provides a reminder that this estimate of @xmath20 is based on the cgwd .",
    "( [ e : sr ] ) can be solved for @xmath0 , which in turn can be inserted into eq .",
    "( [ e : ar ] ) to provide a good estimate for @xmath23 . however , a much better estimate of @xmath23visually indistinguishable from the exact value on a standard - resolution graph  comes from performing a reversion of series of a higher - order version of eq .",
    "( [ e : sr ] ) to yield @xmath0 as a function of @xmath11 , @xmath24 and then inserting this result into eq .",
    "( [ e : ar ] ) : @xmath25   \\ , .\\ ] ] eq .",
    "( [ e : as ] ) should prove quite useful in analyzing data , since it provides an excellent value for @xmath20 as a function of the variance of the twd , assuming the validity of the cgwd description .",
    "we caution that _ all four terms must be kept _ in order to obtain a good estimate of @xmath20 from eq .",
    "( [ e : as ] ) .",
    "we also warn that , as discussed in sec .  [ sec - discrete ] , the effects of discreteness may lead to inconsistencies with this estimate for highly misoriented vicinal surfaces .",
    "a characteristic feature of the cgwd is that as @xmath0 becomes larger , the curve can be better approximated by a gaussian .",
    "this feature should be expected , since it is accepted that twds for strong repulsions are well described by gaussians .",
    "we quantitatively assessed the degree of agreement .",
    "one measure is the @xmath26 of a fit of the cgwd to a gaussian form ( with the three parameters  peak position , prefactor , and standard deviation  as adjustable parameters ) .",
    "we find that this measure of the fit improves exponentially with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "( specifically , @xmath27 provides a close upper bound of @xmath26 for @xmath28 . )",
    "a second and more useful measure is the relative difference of the standard deviation @xmath29 of the fitted gaussian from the actual standard deviation @xmath30 of the cgwd , given by the square root of the second moment of the cgwd about its mean of unity . using eq .",
    "( [ e : br ] ) we find that this relative difference is well described by the formula @xmath31    where the expression for the second moment of the twd with respect to the origin , @xmath32 , is given explicitly as eq.(11 ) of ge or eq .",
    "( 8) of ep .",
    "thus , at the calibration point for repulsive interactions ( @xmath33 , for which an exact solution exists ) the agreement is around 1% , and improves monotonically with increasing @xmath0 . for this range ( @xmath34 )",
    "differences between estimates of @xmath20 obtained from cgwd and the various gaussian fit methods are predominantly due to different philosophies of extracting @xmath20 from @xmath35 rather than from differences in the fitting methods .",
    "as discussed at length in ep and ge , there are several distinct theories for extracting the dimensionless interaction strength @xmath20 from @xmath29 .",
    "monte carlo calculations @xcite indicate that the cgwd provides an excellent estimate of @xmath20 over the range of physical values of this repulsion , as well as for stronger values .",
    "thus , as remarked at the end of the previous section , it is the wisest strategy to use eq .",
    "( [ e : as ] ) to estimate @xmath20 from @xmath35 deduced from the twd rather than to use the predictions of one of the gaussian approximations discussed in table  1 of ge .",
    "the cgwd is a normalized twd with unit mean . in ge ,",
    "the mean was determined straightforwardly from the first moment .",
    "the independent variable ( the terrace width ) was then scaled by this value , and the distribution normalized . in the course of analyzing twds ,",
    "it became obvious that the normalization of the data sets by total area ( that is , the zeroth moment ) and first moment provides qualitative agreement with the cgwd  that is , the `` best fit '' cgwd produces a skew distribution that roughly matches the twd  but it does not match closely enough to reproduce the correct peak position . in order to motivate the more satisfactory treatment of experimental twds in section  [ sec - wigner2param ] , in this section we discuss the effects of perturbations of the mean step separation and of the normalization on the variables important for extracting interaction strengths ( @xmath35 for a gaussian fit and @xmath0 for a wigner fit ) .",
    "such perturbations might arise in experimental data either due to statistical fluctuations or due to physical causes , such as perturbations of the step - step interaction potential @xmath17 or an incomplete equilibration of the vicinal surface .    to this end",
    ", we created an ideal data set by sampling the appropriate distributions at regular intervals .",
    "this ideal set was then perturbed by various factors not exceeding 15% , either by shifting the mean or by scaling each point to increase the area under the curve .",
    "these perturbed sets were then fit as in ge , by normalized fitting functions with unit mean .",
    "since the true value of @xmath0 or @xmath35 for our ideal data set is known , it is simple to determine the error due to the perturbations . in some cases",
    ", the errors behave in complicated ways .    in the equations , @xmath36 is the fitted value of @xmath35 minus the known value of @xmath35 ( and similarly for @xmath37 ) ; @xmath38 ( or @xmath39 ) indicates how much the area under ( or the first moment of ) the constructed curve exceeds the  proper value . \"",
    "( moments about the origin are defined in eq .",
    "( 10 ) of ge .",
    "here for convenience  since we are interested only in differences  we neglect the primes .",
    "the effects of errors in normalization can be described rather simply . the fitted [ normalized ] curve becomes narrower as the area under the raw curve increases . for a gaussian ,",
    "the fractional change in @xmath35 is approximately linear in the fractional error of the integrated twd , with a prefactor about 2/3 :    @xmath40    the coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ e : ds ] ) are insensitive to the value of @xmath35 : if the standard deviation of the raw curve is reduced from 0.30 to 0.20 , the linear coefficient is unchanged , while the quadratic coefficient is reduced slightly to 0.80 . for the cgwd ,",
    "the fit is even more nearly linear :    @xmath41    again increased area leads to an effectively sharper distribution .",
    "the linear coefficient is nearly double that in eq .",
    "( [ e : dr ] ) , as one might expect from eq .",
    "( 13 ) of ge .",
    "this coefficient again is insensitive to the value of @xmath0 of the raw distribution : for @xmath0 = 7.0 it dips slightly to 1.37 .",
    "errors in the mean of the distribution create errors in the fit that are not so easy to describe .",
    "the changes in the fitted parameters are quadratic rather than linear in @xmath39 , and the coefficients depend strongly on the value of @xmath35 or @xmath0 of the raw distribution .    for gaussians ,",
    "we find that the following expression provides a good approximation for standard deviations between 0.2 and 0.4 ( corresponding to 1.5 @xmath42 9 ) :    @xmath43    appendix b provides an analytic derivation of this approximation as the leading - order term in an expansion of the appropriate gaussian integral .",
    "( [ e : ds ] ) can also be generated from straightforward fitting of numerical data .",
    ", which is numerically superior to eq .",
    "( [ e : ds ] ) but does not satisfy proper dimensional behavior . ]    thus , as might be expected since the gaussian is symmetric about its peak , the error is insensitive to the sign of the error in the mean of the raw distribution .",
    "the fitted distribution is broader than the raw one , with the fractional error of the fitted @xmath35 dependent roughly on the  fractional error \" ( with respect to @xmath35 ) of the first moment , i.e. increasing as the distribution becomes sharper .",
    "since the wigner distribution is not symmetric about its peak , the corresponding error in fitting an off - center cgwd by a properly centered cgwd should not be depend purely quadratically on @xmath39 .",
    "indeed , we find over the range 1 @xmath44 8 that an excellent approximation is @xmath45    analogous to the previous result for @xmath35 , the fractional error of @xmath0 has strong quadratic tendencies , with the magnitude of the curvature increasing with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the linear term complicates behavior , causing @xmath0 to increase for small shifts of the curve to the right .",
    "evidently for some @xmath0-dependent offset , the best fit will coincidentally give the true value of @xmath0 .",
    "in fitting experimental twds , it becomes apparent that in many cases  particularly when the data are relatively poor  the cgwds giving the best fits have first moments different from the first moments of the data .",
    "ge noted that the peak of twds can be well fitted by treating a gaussian as a 3-parameter fitting function , with the peak position and the prefactor allowed to vary along with the standard deviation .",
    "( presumably the prefactor differs from its expected value , set by normalizing the gaussian , because of the existence of a small `` hump '' sometimes observed at large values of @xmath46 [ see below ] . )",
    "in contrast , it is not clear how such arbitrary modifications could be made to the cgwd , nor is it clear what physical information could be extracted from a cgwd with arbitrary modifications .    from a basic perspective ,",
    "though , it might be desirable to determine the scaling length ( the `` effective mean , '' which equals the first moment for ideal cgwds ) and the variance in a single fitting procedure rather than to find this length first from the first moment or otherwise . for the following discussion ,",
    "we denote by @xmath47 the effective mean determined as one parameter of a two - parameter least - squares fit of the data to a cgwd , the other parameter being the exponent @xmath0 .",
    "this refined scaling implies that the argument of @xmath48 should be @xmath49 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a new adjustable parameter @xmath50 which gives the ratio of @xmath47 to the actual mean step separation @xmath51 . since @xmath46  still defined as @xmath52",
    " is the natural variable to use in describing data , our refined scaling translates into replacing @xmath46 by @xmath53 in the argument of the distribution .",
    "if the integration variable @xmath46 were also replaced by @xmath53 , then the refined scaling would amount to a redefinition of a dummy variable , and normalization would still be realized .",
    "since the independent variable is kept as @xmath46 , the extra factor is associated with @xmath54 instead :    @xmath55    in other words , the first moment of the distribution , @xmath56 occurs at 1/@xmath50 times the optimal characteristic terrace width @xmath47 .",
    "mathematica_@xmath57 regression routines to fit the experimental data by minimizing the value of @xmath58 as a function of the adjustable parameters .",
    "since the values of @xmath46 are quantized ( cf .  sec .",
    "[ sec - discrete ] ) , there was assumed to be no error in these values . for simplicity ,",
    "all data points were weighted equally .",
    "our findings for vicinal cu surfaces are presented in table 1 , which is similar to table 2 of ge , but contains many cases of `` poor '' data omitted in ge . in order to facilitate discussion ,",
    "twds were divided by ge into three groups based on a visual assessment of their quality :    * a `` good '' twd changes height essentially monotonically below the peak and again above it ; there are no dips , humps , or double peaks , and there is minimal scatter in the data points .",
    "`` good '' data are indicated by a `` @xmath59 '' in table 1 .",
    "* an `` ok '' twd has more scatter , with small dips and peaks introduced by variations ( within the limits of the general margin of error ) of single data points . `` ok '' data are indicated by a `` @xmath60 '' in table 1 . *",
    "a `` poor '' twd has a double - peak or hump at large @xmath46 ; correspondingly , the position of the ( main ) peak occurs noticeably below @xmath46 = 1 , even when the peak is fairly narrow and the skewness minimal .",
    "the judgment that this data is `` poor '' is based both on the intuition of the _ experimenter _ and on the following argument : a second peak at large @xmath46 would be characteristic of the onset of faceting ; however , `` poor '' data tends to occur at high temperatures , whereas faceting should be more important at low temperatures .",
    "`` poor '' data are indicated by a `` @xmath61 '' in table 1 .",
    "as expected , the gaussian distribution yields a reasonable , but not exceptional , fit to the data ; it worked especially well on surfaces with low temperatures , so relatively large @xmath20 .",
    "as an example of good data  exemplified by the vicinal ( 1  1  13 ) surface at 300k , depicted in fig .",
    "1the [ three - parameter ] gaussian yields a @xmath26 value of about 0.0072 .",
    "the single - parameter cgwd fit gives a slightly worse fit to the data , having a @xmath26 of 0.0078 .",
    "for the two - parameter wigner fit",
    "( [ e : psa ] ) ) , the @xmath26 value improves by better than a factor of two , to 0.0037 , with a value of @xmath0 increased slightly ( from 6.4 to 6.5 , leading to a value of @xmath35 closer to that from the gaussian fit . in this case , the optimal fit using eq .",
    "( [ e : psa ] ) is obtained by scaling the terrace widths with a value that is 96.5% of that given by the first moment of the distribution . in other words ,",
    "the first moment of the twd is 3.6% greater than the value of the mean spacing associated with the best fit of the distribution .    in fig .  2",
    ", we display results for this same vicinal cu surface at 378k as an example of poor data , with a large shift in the effective mean . in this case",
    ", having extra degrees of freedom in the fit makes a sizable difference .",
    "for the three - parameter gaussian fit , the @xmath26 is 0.035 ; @xmath26 increases to 0.042 for the single - parameter wigner fit and to about half that value , 0.025 , for the two - parameter fit , all these values being half an order of magnitude larger than in the previous , good case .",
    "the value of @xmath0 increases noticeably  from 2.5 to 3.0  when the refined scaling is allowed ( and rises to 4.3 for the shifted - mean method ) .",
    "the refined scaling factor for terrace widths is 0.867 , meaning that the explicit average @xmath51 of the twd is 15.3% greater than the value of the mean spacing associated with the best fit of the distribution .",
    "characteristic of this sort of data is the hump on the high-@xmath46 side of the peak , which distorts the single - parameter cgwd fit so that it poorly reproduces the peak region .",
    "we emphasize the following general trends in table  1 : in almost all instances , the value of @xmath47 derived from the two - parameter fit to a cgwd is smaller than @xmath62 given by the first moment ( the average ) of the twd ; likewise , the directly measured values of @xmath35 are almost always larger than the values obtained by any of the three fitted curves .",

    "the change of value of @xmath63 is of order a few percent , and the change in @xmath0 and @xmath35 is negligible . for  poor \" data ,",
    "the refined scaling factor is at least twice as large and the two - parameter - fit curve is narrower than the single - parameter - fit curve .",
    "the tails or humps in the experimental twds seem to be responsible for the systematic discrepancies in the fits , especially the smaller mean and smaller variance of the fits relative to the direct measurements .",
    "we have also considered recently reported data for vicinal pt(110 ) at room temperature@xcite . in this system",
    "the terraces are ( @xmath64 ) reconstructed , and the steps correspond to 3-unit segments ( as would be found in a ( @xmath65 ) reconstruction ) .",
    "the authors in that paper conclude that the interaction between their steps is small , but are unable to proceed to a quantitative assessment using preexisting methods : gaussian methods are utterly inappropriate for this regime of small interactions .    in fig .  3",
    ", we show single- and two - parameter wigner fits of the data . for the former , @xmath0 = 2.06 ( @xmath20 = 0.0309 ) , with a @xmath26 of 0.008 . with the latter ,",

    "we see no comparable effect in our companion monte carlo simulations , reported elsewhere@xcite .",
    "due to the crystalline nature of the surface , the twd is a discrete rather than a continuous function : the twd should have a sizable number of counts only at values of @xmath3 that are @xmath66 times the sum of an integer and a constant fractional offset determined by the terrace and the orientation of the steps .",
    "( e.g. , this offset is 1/2 for close - packed steps on \\{1 0 0 } surfaces of fcc crystals . ) for simplicity we neglect this offset in this paper , setting it to zero ( as on \\{1 0 0 } surfaces of sc crystals ) .",

    "this result appears to be contrary to the belief that performing a least - squares fit to an appropriate smooth function is desirable to minimize the effects of statistical fluctuations .",
    "it seems likely , though , that the real problem lies in the weighting of the data in the fit .",
    "it has been suggested that greater weight should be given to the points near the peak of the twd , so we once again repeat our procedure , this time making a least - squares fit in which each point is weighted proportionally to the measured value of @xmath89 . as fig .  [",
    "fig : sample_drho ] shows , the standard deviation of @xmath81 again varies linearly with @xmath0 , but with a slope that is slightly _ higher _ than that of the uniformly - weighted case .",
    "in retrospect , this result should not be surprising , since each point on the twd represents the result of @xmath84 binomial experiments ( _ i.e. , _ bernoulli trials : either the measurement of step separation gives _ this _ distance @xmath90 or _ some other _ distance ) .",
    "elementary statistics@xcite shows that the statistical error of binomial experiments is smallest when the probability of success is nearly zero or nearly one  in our case , for points on the twd with @xmath91 .",

    "there is still the problem that the points are not uncorrelated , which is a requirement of the least - squares procedure@xcite ; the normalization condition imposes a ( weak ) correlation between points .",

    "we define @xmath108 to be the smallest value of @xmath97 for which @xmath109 and likewise @xmath110 to be the smallest value of @xmath95 for which @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a small cutoff ( we recommend @xmath113 ) .",

    "lowering the temperature relative to the kink creation energy would have the effect of further reducing the number of independent measurements and thus increasing the uncertainty in the measured value of @xmath16 .    with such small samples ,",
    "the measured twd can differ distinctly from the dgwd due to statistical fluctuations alone . in order to demonstrate this idea",

    "in this paper we have performed several numerical experiments and analyses to understand better the twds derived from physical data from vicinal surfaces .",
    "we have quantitatively studied how the wigner distribution approaches a gaussian for large dimensionless interactions , and shown that for most systems of physical interest the standard deviation of the terrace width can be estimated from either distribution with little difference .",
    "the mean step width can be estimated in a variety of ways for both wigner and gaussian distributions ; two reasonable but inequivalent choices are directly averaging the step width and fitting the twd to the desired distribution using a nonlinear least - squares routine . in sec .",
    "[ sec - normmean ] we discuss the effects of using an estimated mean that differs from the least - squares estimate . on the other hand , the adjustment of the normalization of the curve to obtain a `` better '' fit is unjustified ; even if the visual agreement appears to improve , no results from theory  such as interaction strengths  can be meaningfully extracted from twds with the wrong normalization .",
    "we have proposed a two - parameter extension of the generalized wigner surmise , which really is just a consistent fitting of both @xmath0 and the mean terrace width within a single two - parameter least - squares fit .",
    "this added flexibility allows one to deal more fruitfully with poorer - than - desirable experimental data , while not changing good data ( or the data emerging from various numerical simulations ) .",
    "thus , this fitting function can applied generally . on the other hand , for `` good '' data",
    ", we have shown that a simple series expansion based on the directly measured mean and standard deviation of the terrace widths has better statistical properties .",
    "the least - squares fit is more robust , but this is a property that is useful _ only _ when the wigner distribution does not capture all of the important physics , such as the role of defects or more complicated step - step interactions ; in such cases , the estimated values of the step - step interaction from the wigner  or the gaussian  distribution must be treated with great caution .    finally , we emphasize the importance of using many stm measurements to insure good statistics and the desirability of calculating the correlations between terrace widths within individual stm images . as we saw in section  [ sec - sample ] , the typical stm image suitable for measuring terrace widths will contain no more than about 50 _ independent _ terrace width measurements , almost two orders of magnitude less than the 4000 total terrace width measurements .",
