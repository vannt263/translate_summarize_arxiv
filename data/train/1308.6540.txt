    "the hadron spectroscopy continues to play the major role in the study of the strong interactions .",
    "the main goal is the exhaustive description of the hadron spectrum in terms of a dimensional parameter and the quark masses .",
    "this task has still not been solved starting from the qcd lagrangian .",
    "a serious progress was achieved by the semirelativistic potential models  @xcite ) .",
    "they enjoyed a striking success in the description of the ground states and related physics .",
    "but their results in the sector of radially excited hadrons were much more modest .    on the basis of qcd one",
    "expects that the formation of resonances should happen in a universal manner at all available scales . in the experimental hadron spectroscopy",
    ", the most studied sector is given by the unflavored vector mesons .",
    "these resonances have the quantum numbers of the photon and therefore are intensively produced in the @xmath4-annihilation which represents a traditional laboratory for the discovery of new quark flavors and for precise measurements of the vector spectrum .",
    "since the creation mechanism for the vector mesons in the @xmath4-annihilation is identical for any flavor and many experimental data is available , the case of the unflavored vector mesons looks the most appropriate for analyzing the manifestations of universality of the strong interactions in the resonance formation .",
    "these manifestations must be reproduced by any viable dynamical model .    in the present note , we study the spectroscopic universality among the vector mesons with hidden flavor  the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 mesons and their analogues in the sector of @xmath8 quarks , the @xmath9-mesons ( the spectrum of @xmath10-mesons is similar and does not bring anything new in our discussions ) . based on the experimental data , the spectroscopic manifestations of the universality in question",
    "are summarized .",
    "we argue that these manifestations may be explained if the total meson mass is composed ( in the first approximation ) of two contributions  a non - relativistic one due to the static quark masses and a relativistic one stemming from the gluon interactions .",
    "the mass spectrum can be described by a simple formula which is universal for all considered mesons .",
    "the found relation is checked and its parameters are estimated .",
    "we indicate then the reason which does not allow to obtain the proposed relation in the usual potential and string - like models and speculate on a possible way for modifying these models",

    "the spectrum of @xmath7-mesons .",
    "let us plot the masses squared of known @xmath9 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7-mesons  @xcite as a function of consecutive number @xmath12 called also the radial quantum number in the potential models . in all cases ( except the @xmath11-meson where the data is scarcer ) we omit the heaviest state as the least reliable one : @xmath13 ( and another candidate @xmath14 )  @xcite , @xmath15  @xcite",
    ", @xmath16  @xcite ( this resonance has a small coupling to the @xmath4-annihilation in comparison with @xmath17  this suggests a strong @xmath18-wave admixture ) . we also try to exclude the @xmath18-wave resonances ( they decouple from the @xmath4-annihilation as it is a point - like process ) .",
    "we ascribe @xmath19 to the @xmath20 state .",
    "the reasons are as follows .",
    "first , although we would have an almost ideal linear trajectory in the case of ascribing @xmath19 to @xmath21 , the slope of such a trajectory differs significantly from the slope of the @xmath9-trajectory .",
    "this looks very unnaturally .",
    "second , the @xmath11 trajectory is expected to have the same universal features as the other vector trajectories .",
    "one of these features is that the ground state lies noticeably below the linear trajectory ( see below ) .",
    "third , the natural mass splitting between the @xmath22 and @xmath21 excitations is 300350  mev .",
    "the splitting between @xmath23 and @xmath19 is about 500  mev .",
    "such a value is more typical for mass splittings between the @xmath22 and @xmath20 excitations .",
    "fourth , our fits below are better if @xmath19 is treated as the @xmath20 state .    the figs .",
    "( 1a)(1d ) demonstrate a universal linear behavior of the kind @xmath24 with the ground state lying below the linear trajectory .",
    "the spectrum   is a typical prediction of the hadron string ( flux - tube ) models with massless quark and antiquark at the ends ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the experimental observation of the behavior   in the light non - strange mesons  @xcite is often used as an argument in favor of the string - like models proposed by nambu  @xcite .",
    "the hadron strings loaded by massive quarks predict that @xmath25 becomes essentially non - linear function of @xmath2 ( see , e.g. , an example below ) . in reality , however , we observe the linear spectrum   for heavy quarkonia with the same ( or even better ) accuracy - mesons as an almost linear while that of the @xmath7-mesons as having significant deviations from the linearity .",
    "we believe that , within the experimental uncertainty , the spectra of all unflavored vector mesons are nearly linear except the state @xmath26  the mass of a ground state lies noticeably below the corresponding linear trajectory , see figs .",
    "( 1a)(1d ) . ] .",
    "in addition , the slope @xmath3 is proportional to the string tension ( or energy per unit length in the potential models with linearly rising confinement potential ) related to the pure gluodynamics .",
    "thus , theoretically the slope @xmath3 is expected to be universal for all flavors .",
    "the fits in table  2 show that this is not the case .",
    "we find reasonable to display two fits  the fit  ( a ) includes all states from table  1 and in the fit  ( b ) the ground states are excluded .",
    "the reason is that the ground states lie systematically below the linear trajectory and the physics behind this effect is obscure , at least for us .",
    "the relation   holds in many relativistic models for light quarkonia where the boson masses enter quadratically .",
    "the data shows that the relativistic universality   takes place qualitatively but is strongly broken quantitatively for heavy flavors .",
    ".the masses of known @xmath9 , @xmath11 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons ( in mev )  @xcite which are used in our analysis .",
    "the experimental error is not displayed if it is less than 1  mev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     these two contributions are clearly separated . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the relation   ( or  ) can not be reproduced in the commonly used potential and string - like models .",
    "the basic problem is that such a separation of relativistic and non - relativistic contributions is abselt . in the potential models ,",
    "one encounters the following dichotomy : the quark masses give an additive contribution to the meson mass in the non - relativistic models , this is correct , fut the gluodynamics is then non - reqativistic , this is not correct ; in the relativistic potential models , the gluodynamics becomes relativistic , this is correct , but the quark masses do not yield an additive contribution because of the replacement  , and this seems not to be correct .",
    "an _ ad hoc _ way out for the latter models could consist in imposing the linear dispersion relation @xmath27 for the quarks .",
    "the relation   should somehow arise due to the off - shell nature of quarks .",
    "the same _ ad hoc _ prescription can be used in the flux - tube models  if , instead of  , one makes the replacement @xmath28 in  , the final relation for meson masses will have the form  .",
    "another possibility for the string - like models could be the requirement to base such models on the picture of static quarks , i.e. the quantization should be performed with fixed endpoints and the object of quantization should be only the field between the quark and antiquark .",
    "the simplest effective toy - model might look as follows : the quark and antiquark interact by the exchange of some ( nearly ) massless particle , say the pion or ( perhaps massive ) gluon , and one mimics this exchange by oscillatory motion of the particle to which the quantization condition   is applied .",
    "this exchange picture looks more natural from the point of view of the resonance production .",
    "indeed , when the relativistic quark and antiquark are created and move back - to - back , it is very unlikely that a `` turning point '' could emerge .",
    "rather the gluon field between quarks `` resonates '' at certain production energies of quark - antiquark pairs and something like a quasi - bound state appears .",
    "the relation   can be interpreted as a reflection of the fundamental property that in any dynamical model one can not calculate absolute energies but only energy differences .",
    "the constant @xmath29 embraces the contributions which are not described by the confinement mechanism ( quark mass , spin - spin and spin - orbital contributions , etc . ) .",
    "our fits show that in the unflavored vector mesons of all kinds , the dominant contribution to @xmath29 stems from the quark masses .",
    "perhaps this is related to the fact that the quarks ( being fermions ) give negative contribution to the qcd vacuum energy",
    ". this effect may provide an heuristic understanding of our conclusion on the static nature of quarks : injecting a quark - antiquark pair ( with the quark mass @xmath29 ) into the qcd vacuum , one lowers its minimum roughly by the value of @xmath30 .",
    "and , in the first approximation , this seems to be the only quark effect that should be taken into account in the dynamical quark models .",
    "for this reason , any model constructed for the description of the light - meson spectroscopy should be equally ( within the accuracy of the narrow - resonance approximation ) good for the heavy mesons and vice versa , at least in the vector sector .",
    "for instance , the linear spectrum   is reproduced in the soft - wall holographic models for qcd  @xcite .",
    "our analysis shows that these models can be applied without change of initial input parameters to the heavy vector mesons  one just shifts the obtained spectrum by @xmath30 , as in the relation  .    in summary",
    ", we believe that the description of heavy and light hadrons basically should be very similar , if not identical .",
    "we have shown how to reveal the spectroscopic universality in the case of unflavored vector mesons where a sufficient amount of experimental data is available .",
    "it would be interesting to study manifestations of universality for other quantum numbers .",
    "this may yield , for instance , plenty of spectroscopic predictions .",
    "we have performed a regge - like analysis for the combined radial spectrum of unflavored vector mesons .",
    "our choice was driven by the fact that the radial spectrum of these hadrons is the best established .",
    "we argued that in order to unify the linear regge - like behavior and the approximately universal mass splittings between the radial excitations one must generalize the usual linear trajectories to the form  .",
    "the phenomenological analysis of the proposed relation was carried out and it is proved to be quite reasonable .",
    "the ensuing spectroscopic predictions are enumerated .",
    "a natural extension of the relation   to the vector mesons with open flavor was also analyzed and the arising predictions are demonstrated .",
    "we discussed a possible physical origin of the proposed generalization for the linear radial trajectories .",
    "one of possibilities consists in the use of the linear dispersion relation   for quarks instead of the usual quadratic one .",
    "such a dispersion law could emerge from the off - shell nature of quarks",
    ". it would be curious to try to use this linear dispersion relation in the relativistic models for hadron spectrum , for instance , in the relativized potential models .",
    "we expect that this will lead to a better description of the radial spectrum .",
