    "many protein functions fundamentally depend on structural flexibility . complex conformational transitions , induced by ligand binding for example , are often essential to proteins participating in regulatory networks or enzyme catalysis . more generally , a protein s ability to sample a variety of conformational sub - states implies that proteins have an intrinsic flexibility and mobility that influences their function.@xcite while experimental measurement can offer direct dynamical information about specific residues , uncovering the detailed mechanisms controlling conformational transitions between two meta - stable states is often elusive . in this paper",
    "we present an analytic model that aims to clarify the relationship between main - chain dynamics and the mechanisms controlling conformational transitions of flexible proteins .",
    "in particular , we examine the mechanism for the open / closed transition of the n - terminal domain of calmodulin ( ncam ) to explore how calcium binding and target recognition can be understood by changes in the mobility and the degree of partial order of the protein backbone .",
    "calmodulin ( cam ) may be an ideal model system to illustrate how conformational flexibility is a major determinant of biological function .",

    "cam is a small ( 148 amino acid ) dumbbell shaped protein with two domains connected by a flexible linker .",
    "each domain of cam contains a pair of helix - loop - helix ca@xmath1 -binding motifs called ef - hands ( helices a / b and c / d in the n - terminal domain ) .",
    "these two ef - hands are connected by a flexible b / c helix - linker ( see fig .  [ fig:2nd_3d ] ) . in each domain",
    "the four helices of apo - cam are directed in a somewhat antiparallel fashion giving the domains a relatively compact structure while leaving the ca@xmath1-binding loops exposed .",
    "the conformational change induced by binding ca@xmath1 can be described as a change in ef - hand interhelical angle ( between helices a / b and c / d ) from nearly antiparallel ( apo , closed conformation ) to nearly perpendicular ( holo , open conformation ) orientation .",
    "further this domain opening mechanism in ncam indicates that binding of ca@xmath1 occurs almost exclusively within ef - hands , not between them.@xcite the structural rearrangement from closed to open exposes a large hydrophobic surface rich in methionine residues responisble for molecular recognition of various cellular targets such as myosin light chain kinase .",
    "the high flexibility of cam is essential to its function .",
    "the flexibility of the central helix linking the two domains allows the activated domains to simultaneously interact with target peptides .",
    "the conformational flexibility of the domains themselves allow for considerable binding promiscuity of target peptides , a property essential to its function as a primary messenger in ca@xmath1 signal transduction.@xcite while similar in structure and fold , the two domains of cam are quite different in terms of their flexibility , melting temperatures , and ca@xmath1-binding affinities.@xcite    the conformational dynamics of ca@xmath1-loaded and ca@xmath1-free cam are well characterized by solution nmr.@xcite site specific internal dynamics monitored by model free order parameters @xmath2 , indicate that the helices of the apo - cam domains are well - folded on the picosecond to nanosecond timescale , while the ca@xmath1-binding loops , helix - linker and termini are more flexible.@xcite on the other hand , spin - spin relaxation ( or transverse auto - relaxation ) rates , @xmath3 , indicate that the free and bound forms of the regulatory protein exchange on the millisecond timescale.@xcite akke and coworkers have investigated the rate of conformational exchange between the open and closed conformational substrates of c - terminal cam ( ccam ) domain by nmr @xmath4n spin relaxation experiments.@xcite comparison of exchange rates as a function of ca@xmath1 concentration have established that the conformational exchange in apo - ccam involves an equilibrium switching between the closed and open states that is independent of ca@xmath1 concentration.@xcite    x - ray crystallography temperature factors give additional insight into the conformational freedom and internal flexibility of cam in the open and closed state .",

    "this segment , called the ef - hand-@xmath0-scaffold , refers to the bond network that connects the two ca@xmath1 ions .",
    "it includes the backbone and the two hydrogen bonds formed by the residues in the 8@xmath5 position of binding loops ( ile27 and ile63 ) and the c = o groups of the residues in the 7@xmath5 position of the binding loops ( thr26 and thr62).@xcite indeed , in the absence of ca@xmath1 , the n - terminal end of the binding loop is found to be poorly structured and very dynamic from nmr structures  @xcite and x - ray temperature factors.@xcite functional distinction between the two ends of the binding loops in the domain opening mechanism is buttressed by the great variability of the amino acid sequences of the n - terminal ends of the ca@xmath1-binding loops compared with the more conserved c - terminal ends across a variety of different ef - hand ca@xmath1-binding proteins.@xcite    in this paper , we study the role of flexibility in the conformational transition of cam through an extension of a coarse - grained variational model developed to characterize protein folding.@xcite this model accommodates two meta - stable folded conformations as minima of the calculated free energy surface .",
    "the natural order parameters of this model , discussed in detail in the methods section , is well suited to describe partially ordered ensembles essential to the conformational dynamics of flexible proteins .",

    "the transition route for ncam is on the order of several minutes on a typical single - processor pc .",

    "has demonstrated the use of coarse - grained protein models with simplified representations , such as , only @xmath7-carbons as point masses and simplified energy functions.@xcite such models require much less computational cost making them practical to describe the conformational transitions of even large proteins.@xcite analyzing the fluctuations about a single minimum has been surprisingly successful in identifying relevant cooperative motions in a wide range of proteins .",
    "the commonly used tirion potential  @xcite ( which can be viewed as a harmonic go - model ) gives a simple one parameter model in which the relevant motions for the transition is identified as one of many low frequency normal modes.@xcite while this approach can provide considerable insight , it offers a limited description of the transition because it is based only on the fluctuations about one structure .",
    "the tirion potential has recently been extended to include two conformations in which the contact map defining the potential and normal modes is updated as the protein is moved along a known reaction coordinate.@xcite local unfolding and flexibility is accommodated by relieving regions of high stress , `` cracking '' , which modifies the contact map .",
    "coarse - grained simulations in which the potential interpolates between two folded - state biased contact maps have also been introduced recently.@xcite for example , in the plastic network model of margakis and karplus  @xcite the individual basins are approximated by the tirion potential and are then smoothly connected by a secular equation formulation .",
    "a similar interpolation was considered by okazaki et al .",
    "@xcite alternatively , best et al .",
    "developed a two - state approximation  @xcite analogous to eq .",
    "[ eq : contact ] .",
    "these advances are similar in spirt to our approach , albeit with distinct approximations for the basic description of partially ordered ensembles .",
    "in this paper , we study the intrinsic flexibility and structural change in the n - terminal domain of cam ( ncam ) during open to close transition .",
    "the predicted transition route from our model gives a detailed picture of the interplay between structural transition , conformational flexibility and function of n - terminal calmodulin ( ncam ) domain .",
    "the results from our model are largely consistent with the important role that the immobile ef@xmath0-scaffold region plays in the transition mechanism . dissection of the transition route of this region further suggests that it is the early structural change of loop ii that drives the cooperative completion of the interactions between the loops in the open structure .",
    "the strong qualitative agreement with available experimental measurements of flexibility is an encouraging validation of the model .",
    "recently , the folding dynamics of zinc - metallated protein ( azurin ) was studied using a similar variational model and compared with experiments for the detail coordination reaction coupled with the entatic state.@xcite a similar future study of detail coordination reaction for the complete description of conformational change stabilized by ion binding in cam seems very promising .",
    "ultimately , we wish to extend this model to investigate the binding mechanism and kinetic paths of several peptides to ca@xmath1-loaded cam .",
    "since large conformational changes coupled to binding depends fundamentally on the fluctuations of partially folded conformations,@xcite this polymer based variational formalism can accommodate coupled folding and binding very naturally .",
