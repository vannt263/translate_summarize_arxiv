    "we report the results of a high statistics simulation .",
    "different analysis techniques are studied and chiral extrapolations are discussed .",
    "the strangeness scalar density and electric and magnetic form factors are all analyzed together , and results are compared to experimental data .",
    "the nucleon s strangeness form factors arise from a disconnected strange quark loop that we compute stochastically using real @xmath1 noise@xcite . to reduce the variance ,",

    "the chiral limit is @xmath15 and our @xmath16 values are in the strange region .",
    "the mass of the quark in the loop will be held fixed at a value corresponding to @xmath17 and the analysis will be based on 2000 configurations with 60 @xmath1 noises per configuration .",

    "the physical situation must lie between these two extremes , and so we expect the true values to be somewhere between the curves in fig .  [ figfinal ] .",
    "( for another recent discussion of chiral fitting , see ref .",
    "the results of figure  [ figfinal ] compare to the existing experimental results as follows : @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 gev@xmath31 and @xmath32 gev@xmath31 . for the scalar density ,",
    "we find @xmath33 which can be compared to the result of 0.195(9 ) reported in ref .  @xcite .    we have not attempted to estimate the sizes of systematic uncertainties in our results due , for example , to quenching and to the use of chiral extrapolations for valence quarks in the strange region .",
    "the raw lattice data of table  [ tableraw ] show , at best , only tiny strange quark effects over the range of momenta and quark masses that were studied .",
    "large strange - quark loop contributions in the vector current matrix elements should be considered unlikely .",
