    "a fundamental problem in mathematics is understanding the way how the non - critical levels @xmath10 of an analytic map - germ @xmath11 , @xmath12 , degenerate to the special fibre @xmath13 .",
    "for instance , when @xmath3 is holomorphic , the celebrated milnor s fibration theorem says that the @xmath14 form a locally trivial fibration over a punctured disc . and a remarkable theorem of l dng trng @xcite says that when @xmath3 further has an isolated critical point , inside each @xmath15 one has a polyhedron @xmath16 of middle dimension which  collapses \" as we approach the special fiber , and the complement @xmath17 is diffeomorphic to @xmath18 . if @xmath3 is holomorphic with non - isolated singularities , one still has milnor s fibration theorem and there is a rich theory , developed by d. massey and many others , explaining how the fibers @xmath14 degenerate into the special fiber @xmath19 .",
    "there is an alternative viewpoint to this problem , which arises from work by siersma @xcite , michel - pichon @xcite and nemethi - szilard @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . for this",
    "we recall that given a real analytic map - germ @xmath3 as above one has the link of @xmath3 , that we denote by @xmath20 , which by definition is @xmath21 , the intersection with a sufficiently small sphere .",
    "the link can be regarded as being the boundary of @xmath19 , and it is non - singular if and only if @xmath3 has no other critical points near @xmath22 . in that case",
    "@xmath20 is isotopic to the boundary @xmath23 of the milnor fiber @xmath15 , and this crucial fact was essential in the classical work of milnor , brieskorn , hirzebruck and others , to study the topology of the link @xmath20 .    in general the link @xmath20",
    "is a real analytic singular variety , whose homeomorphism type is independent of all choices and determines the topology of @xmath24 .",
    "the boundary of the milnor fibre is a smooth manifold with a rich topology ( see for instance @xcite ) , and these manifolds @xmath23 degenerate into the link @xmath20 . in this article",
    "we study this degeneration @xmath25 .",
    "we recall that the links of isolated singularities in complex analytic spaces have proved to be a rich family of manifolds to be considered for various problems in geometry and topology .",
    "the setting we envisage here provides a larger class of manifolds , which still come equipped with a rich geometry and topology .",
    "we first prove ( theorem [ theo_c4 ] ) :    .2 cm    * theorem .",
    "*    _ let @xmath0 , with @xmath1 , be a real analytic map - germ such that @xmath26 is an isolated critical value and @xmath3 has the thom @xmath2-property .",
    "let @xmath27 be the singular set of @xmath28 and let @xmath29 be its link . then : _",
    ".1 cm * @xmath30 * there exists a compact regular neighbourhood @xmath31 of @xmath32 in @xmath33 with smooth boundary , such that for all @xmath34 with @xmath35 sufficiently small , one has that @xmath36 is homeomorphic to @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the interior of @xmath31 .",
    ".1 cm    * @xmath39 * if we suppose that @xmath27 has at most an isolated singularity , then @xmath31 can be chosen to be a fibre bundle over @xmath32 with fibre a disk .",
    ".1 cm    * @xmath40 * in this latter case one has that the intersection @xmath41 is a fibre bundle over @xmath32 if and only if the intersection @xmath42 is a fibre bundle over @xmath32 , and this happens if and only if @xmath43 is a stratum of a whitney stratification of @xmath3 .",
    ".2 cm    we remark that if @xmath3 is as above , then it has a milnor - l fibration ( see for instance @xcite ) : @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the closed ball in @xmath46 centered at @xmath22 and with radius @xmath47 , @xmath48 denotes the closed ball in @xmath49 centered at @xmath22 and with radius @xmath50 and @xmath51 denotes the punctured disk @xmath52 .",
    "following @xcite we call a manifold @xmath31 as in the theorem above a _ vanishing zone _ for @xmath3 .",
    "so the idea is that outside the vanishing zone @xmath31 , the link @xmath20 is smooth and diffeomorphic to that part of the boundary of the milnor fibre which lies outside @xmath31 .",
    "then one must focus on what happens inside @xmath31 .",
    "this is interesting for two reasons . on the one hand",
    "the boundary of the milnor manifold , being a smooth manifold , can be easier to handle than the link , and understanding the way how @xmath23 degenerates into @xmath20 throws light into the topology of the link , just as the study of the vanishing cycles on the milnor fiber throws light into the topology of the special fiber .",
    "on the other hand we can argue conversely , and understanding the degeneration @xmath25 allows us to re - construct @xmath23 out from @xmath28 itself .",
    "for instance , this was the approach followed in @xcite to show that in the cases under consideration in those articles , the boundary @xmath23 is a waldhausen manifold .",
    "in the second part of this article we concentrate on analytic functions of the form : @xmath53 where @xmath54 are holomorphic functions such that the real analytic map - germ @xmath7 has an isolated critical value at @xmath55 . in @xcite pichon and seade proved that such a map - germ has the thom @xmath2-property and hence there exist sufficient small positive reals @xmath56 such that the restriction @xmath57 is a locally trivial fibration .    for this we first extend ( in section [ section_lp - real ] ) l s construction in @xcite of a  vanishing polyhedron \" , to the case of map - germs of the type @xmath8 with an isolated critical point .",
    "and then , using the results of sections [ section_bmf ] and [ section_lp - real ] , we study in section [ section_degeneration ] the degeneration of the boundary of the milnor fibre to the link , for real analytic map - germs of the type @xmath5 satisfying some hypothesis .",
    "notice that if @xmath9 is constant , then @xmath7 is a holomorphic map - germ . in @xcite , f. michel and a. pichon",
    "describe very precisely a way of constructing a vanishing zone and the boundary of the milnor fibre for holomorphic map - germs @xmath58 .",
    "this was done also in @xcite in a different way , somehow inspired by nemethi - szilard s work @xcite , and that construction works also for map germs @xmath59 .",
    "the constructions we give in this article do not give so much information about the boundary of the milnor as those in @xcite , but they have the advantage of applying in very general settings , thus throwing light on the topology of real analytic map - germs with non - isolated singularities .",
    "the authors are grateful to m. a. s. ruas for helpful discussions .",
    "consider now a real analytic map germ @xmath60 such that @xmath26 is an isolated critical value and @xmath3 has the thom @xmath2-property , so @xmath3 has a local milnor - l fibration .",
    "set @xmath61 and let @xmath62 be the link of @xmath3 .",
    "we denote by @xmath63 the link of the singular set of @xmath64 . by @xmath23",
    "we denote the boundary of a milnor fibre @xmath15 , so @xmath65 for @xmath34 such that @xmath66 .",
    "then @xmath23 is a smooth submanifold of the sphere @xmath33 and as @xmath67 tends to @xmath22 , this manifold degenerates to the link @xmath20 . following @xcite and @xcite ( also @xcite ) ,",
    "in this section we look at the way how @xmath23 degenerates into @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath68    we have :    a _ vanishing zone _ for @xmath20 is a regular neighborhood @xmath31 of @xmath32 in @xmath33 with smooth boundary , such that for all @xmath34 sufficiently near @xmath22 , the smooth manifold @xmath36 is diffeomorphic to @xmath37 .",
    "we shall construct a vanishing zone for every real analytic map - germ @xmath3 as above , using the idea of a _ cellular tube _ of a submanifold @xmath69 of a manifold @xmath70 , defined by brasselet in @xcite .",
    "this construction is classical in pl - topology and generalizes the concept of tubular neighborhoods .",
    "[ vz ] there exists a compact regular neighbourhood @xmath31 of @xmath32 in @xmath33 such that its boundary @xmath71 is smooth and it intersects @xmath20 transversally .",
    "moreover , if @xmath27 is either a smooth manifold or it has an isolated singularity , then @xmath31 is a fibre bundle over @xmath32 with fibre an @xmath72-dimensional disk in @xmath33 , where @xmath73 is the dimension of @xmath27 .",
    "let us consider a whitney stratification of @xmath33 such that @xmath20 is a union of strata .",
    "now let us consider a triangulation @xmath74 of @xmath33 such that each strata of the whitney stratification is a union of simplices .",
    "let @xmath75 be the barycentric decomposition of @xmath74 .",
    "using @xmath75 one constructs the associated cellular dual decomposition @xmath76 of @xmath33 : given a simplex @xmath77 in @xmath74 of dimension @xmath78 , its dual @xmath79 is the union of all simplices @xmath80 in @xmath75 whose closure meets @xmath77 exactly at its barycenter @xmath81 , that is , @xmath82 it is a cell of dimension @xmath83 . taking the union of all these dual cells",
    "we get the dual decomposition @xmath76 of @xmath74 . by construction ,",
    "each cell @xmath77 intersects its dual @xmath79 transversally .",
    "we let @xmath31 be the union of cells in @xmath76 which are dual of simplices in @xmath32 ; it provides a cellular tube around @xmath32 in @xmath33 , which means it satisfies the following properties :    * @xmath31 is a compact neighbourhood of @xmath32 containing @xmath32 in its interior , and @xmath71 is a retract of @xmath84 ; * @xmath31 retracts to @xmath32 ; * for any neighbourhood @xmath85 of @xmath32 in @xmath33 , if the triangulation of @xmath33 is sufficiently  fine \" then we can assume @xmath86 .",

    ".    then one can see that @xmath93 therefore @xmath71 intersects @xmath20 transversally .",
    "moreover , if @xmath27 is either a smooth manifold or an isolated singularity , it follows that @xmath32 is a smooth manifold without boundary , and then it follows from section 1.1.2 of @xcite that @xmath31 is a bundle on @xmath32 whose fibres are disks .",
