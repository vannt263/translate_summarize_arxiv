    "large systems consisting of many coupled oscillatory units occur in a wide variety of situations @xcite .",
    "thus the study of the behaviors that such systems exhibit has been an active and continuing area of research .",
    "an important early contribution in this field was the introduction in 1975 by kuramoto @xcite of a simple model which illustrates striking features of such systems .",
    "kuramoto employed two key simplifications in arriving at his model : ( i ) the coupling between units was chosen to be homogeneous and all - to - all ( i.e. , ` global ' ) , so that each oscillator would have an equal effect on all other oscillators ; and ( ii ) the oscillator states were solely described by a phase angle @xmath0 , so that their uncoupled dynamics obeyed the simple equation @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the intrinsic natural frequency of oscillator @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the number of oscillators , and @xmath5 .",
    "the natural frequencies @xmath6 are , in general , different for each oscillator and are assumed to be drawn from some prescribed distribution function @xmath7 .",
    "much of the research on the kuramoto model has focused on the case where @xmath7 is unimodal ( for reviews of this literature , see @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , @xmath8 is usually assumed to be symmetric about a maximum at frequency @xmath9 and to decrease monotonically and continuously to zero as @xmath10 increases . in that case",
    ", it was found that as the coupling strength @xmath11 between the oscillators increases from zero in the large-@xmath12 limit , there is a continuous transition at a critical coupling strength @xmath13 . for @xmath11 below @xmath14 , the average macroscopic , time - asymptotic behavior of the system is such that the oscillators in the system behave incoherently with respect to each other , and an order parameter ( defined in sec .",
    "[ section2 ] ) is correspondingly zero .",
    "as @xmath11 increases past @xmath14 , the oscillators begin to influence each other in such a way that there is collective global organization in the phases of the oscillators , and the time - asymptotic order parameter assumes a non - zero constant value that increases continuously for @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "it is natural to ask how these results change if other forms of @xmath7 are considered . in this paper",
    "we will address this question for what is perhaps the simplest choice of a non - unimodal frequency distribution : we consider a distribution @xmath7 that has two peaks @xcite and is the sum of two identical unimodal distributions @xmath16 , such that @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "we find that this modification to the original problem introduces qualitatively new behaviors .",
    "as might be expected , this problem has been previously addressed @xcite .",
    "however , due to its difficulty , the problem was not fully solved , and , as we shall show , notable features of the behavior were missed .",
    "the development that makes our analysis possible is the recent paper of ott and antonsen @xcite . using the method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite we reduce the original problem formulation from an integro - partial - differential equation @xcite for the oscillator distribution function ( a function of @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) to a system of just a few ordinary differential equations ( odes ) .",
    "furthermore , we analyze the reduced ode system to obtain its attractors and the bifurcations they experience with variation of system parameters .    the reduced ode system , however , represents a special restricted class of all the possible solutions of the original full system @xcite .",
    "thus a concern is that the reduced system might miss some of the actual system behavior . in order to check this ,",
    "we have done numerical solutions of the full system .",
    "the result is that , in all cases tested , the time - asymptotic attracting behavior of the full system and the observed attractor bifurcations are all contained in , and are quantitatively described by , our ode formulation . indeed a similar result applies for the application of the method of ref .",
    "@xcite to the original kuramoto model with unimodally distributed frequencies @xcite and to the problem of the forced kuramoto model with periodic drive @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the reduction method has not been mathematically proven to capture all the attractors , for any of the systems to which it has been applied  @xcite . throughout this paper",
    "we operate under the assumption ( based on our numerical evidence ) that the reduction method is reliable for the bimodal kuramoto model .",

    "[ section3 ] are a delineation of the different types of attractors that can exist , the regions of parameter space that they occupy ( including the possibility of bistability and hysteresis ) , and the types of bifurcations that the attractors undergo .    in sec .",

    ", we confirm that these attractors and bifurcations are also present in the original system .",
    "in addition , we investigate the case where @xmath7 is a sum of gaussians , rather than cauchy - lorentz distributions .",
    "we find that the attractors and bifurcations in the lorentzian case and in the gaussian case are of the same types and that parameter space maps of the different behaviors are qualitatively similar for the two distributions .    finally , in sec .  [ section6 ]",
    "we compare our results to the earlier work of kuramoto @xcite and crawford @xcite .",

    "we conclude by relating our work to three previous studies , and then offer suggestions for further research , both theoretical and experimental .      in his book on coupled oscillators ,",
    "kuramoto @xcite speculated about how the transition from incoherence to mutual synchronization might be modified if the oscillators natural frequencies were bimodally distributed across the population .",
    "on pp.7576 of ref .",
    "@xcite , he wrote `` so far , the nucleation has been supposed to be initiated at the center of symmetry of @xmath8 .",
    "this does not seem to be true , however , when @xmath8 is concave there . ''",
    "his reasoning was that for a bimodal system , synchrony would be more likely to start at the peaks of @xmath8 . if that were true , it would mean that a system with two equal peaks would go directly from incoherence to having two synchronized clusters of oscillators , or what we have called the standing wave state , as the coupling @xmath11 is increased .",
    "the critical coupling at which this transition would occur , he argued , should be @xmath152 , analogous to his earlier result for the unimodal case . according to this scenario ,",
    "the synchronized clusters would be tiny at onset , comprised only of oscillators with natural frequencies near the peaks of @xmath20 .",
    "because of their small size , kuramoto claimed these clusters `` will behave almost independently of each other . '' with further increases in @xmath11 , however , the clusters `` will come to behave like a coupled pair of giant oscillators , and for even stronger coupling they will eventually be entrained to each other to form a single giant oscillator . ''",
    "( this is what we have called the partially synchronized state . )",
    "let us now re - examine kuramoto s conjectures in light of our analytical and numerical results , as summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : bd_overview](a ) . for a fair comparison",
    ", we must assume that @xmath8 is concave at its center frequency @xmath153 ; for the bimodal lorentzian ( eq .",
    "( [ bimodaldist ] ) , this is equivalent to @xmath154 .",
    "( otherwise @xmath8 is unimodal and incoherence bifurcates to partial synchronization as @xmath11 is increased , consistent with kuramoto s classic result as well as the lowest portion of fig .",
    "[ fig : bd_overview](a ) . )    so restricting attention from now on to the upper part of fig.[fig : bd_overview](a ) where @xmath154 , what actually happens as @xmath11 increases ? was kuramoto right that the bifurcation sequence is always incoherence @xmath155 standing wave @xmath155 partial synchronization ?",
    "for @xmath156 between @xmath157 and @xmath158 ( meaning the distribution is just barely bimodal ) , incoherence bifurcates directly to partial synchronization  the `` single giant oscillator '' state  without ever passing through an intermediate standing wave state . in effect",
    ", the system still behaves as if it were unimodal .",
    "but there is one new wrinkle : we now see hysteresis in the transition between incoherence and partial synchronization , as reflected by the lower bistable region in fig .",
    "[ fig : bd_overview](a ) .",
    "is there any part of fig .",
    "[ fig : bd_overview](a ) where kuramoto s scenario really does occur ? yes  but",
    "it requires that the peaks of @xmath8 be sufficiently well separated . specifically , suppose @xmath159 , the value at the codimension-2 saddle - node - loop point where the homoclinic and sniper curves meet ( i.e. , point d in fig .  [ fig : mainbifdiag1 ] ) . in this regime",
    "everything behaves as kuramoto predicted .",
    "an additional subtlety occurs in the intermediate regime where the peaks of @xmath8 are neither too far apart nor too close together .",
    "suppose that @xmath160 .",
    "here the system shows a different form of hysteresis .",
    "the bifurcations occur in the sequence that kuramoto guessed as @xmath11 increases , but _ not _ on the return path .",
    "instead , the system skips the standing wave state and dissolves directly from partial synchronization to incoherence as @xmath11 is decreased .",
    "finally we note that kuramoto s conjectured formula @xmath152 is incorrect , although it becomes asymptotically valid in the limit of widely separated peaks . specifically , his prediction is equivalent to @xmath161 , which approaches the correct result @xmath162 as @xmath163 .",
    "crawford @xcite obtained the first mathematical results for the system studied in this paper . using center manifold theory , he calculated the weakly nonlinear behavior of the infinite - dimensional system in the neighborhood of the incoherent state . from this",
    "he derived the stability boundary of incoherence .",
    "his analysis also included the effects of white noise in the governing equations .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     figure  [ fig : bd_overview](b ) , reproduced from fig .  4 in ref .",
    "@xcite , summarizes crawford s findings . here",
    "@xmath164 is the noise strength ( note : our analysis is limited to @xmath165 ) , @xmath166 is the width of the lorentzians ( equivalent to @xmath26 in our notation ) , and @xmath27 are the center frequencies of the lorentzians ( as here ) . the dashed line in fig .  [ fig : bd_overview](b ) shows crawford s schematic depiction of the unknown stability boundary between the standing waves and the partially synchronized state .",
    "he suggested a strategy for calculating this boundary , and highlighted it as an open problem , writing in the figure caption ,  ... the precise nature and location of this boundary have not been determined .",
    "\" our results , summarized in figs .  [ fig : mainbifdiag1 ] and fig .  [ fig : bd_overview](a ) , now fill in the parts that were missing from crawford s analysis .      in a series of papers ( see @xcite for a review ) , bonilla and his colleagues have explored what happens if one replaces the lorentzians in the frequency distribution with @xmath167-functions , and adds white noise to the governing equations .",
    "the resulting system can be viewed as a stochastic counterpart of the model studied here ; in effect , the noise blurs the @xmath167-functions into bell - shaped distributions analogous to lorentzians or guassians . and",
    "indeed , the system shows much of the same phenomenology as seen here : incoherence , partially synchronized states , standing waves , and bistability @xcite .",
    "however , a complete bifurcation diagram analogous to fig .",
    "[ fig : mainbifdiag1 ] has not yet been worked out for this model .",
    "the difficulty is that no counterpart of the ansatz ( [ eq : poisson ] ) has been found ; the stochastic problem is governed by a second - order fokker - planck equation , not a first - order continuity equation , and the ott - antonsen ansatz ( [ eq : poisson ] ) no longer works in this case .",
    "perhaps there is some way to generalize the ansatz appropriately so as to reduce the stochastic model to a low - dimensional system , but for now this remains an open problem .",
    "there are several other questions suggested by the work described here .",
    "the most important open problem is to clarify the scope and limits of the ott - antonsen method used in sec .",
    "[ section2b ] . under what conditions",
    "is it valid to assume that the infinite - dimensional kuramoto model can be replaced by the low - dimensional dynamical system implied by the ott - antonsen ansatz ? or to ask it another way , when do all the attractors of the infinite - dimensional system lie in the low - dimensional invariant manifold corresponding to this ansatz ?",
    "this question has now become particularly pressing , because two counterexamples have recently come to light in which the ott - antonsen method  @xcite gives an incomplete account of the full system s dynamics . when the method was applied to the problem of chimera states for two interacting populations of identical phase oscillators",
    ", it predicted only stationary and periodic chimeras @xcite , whereas subsequent numerical experiments revealed that quasiperiodic chimeras can also exist and be stable @xcite .",
    "likewise , chaotic states are known to emerge from a wide class of initial conditions for series arrays of identical overdamped josephson junctions coupled through a resistive load @xcite . yet the ott - antonsen ansatz can not account for these chaotic states , because the reduced ode system turns out to be only two dimensional @xcite .",
    "what makes this all the more puzzling is that the method works so well in other cases .",
    "it seems to give a full inventory of the attractors for the bimodal kuramoto model studied here , as well as for the unimodal kuramoto model in its original form  @xcite or with external periodic forcing  @xcite .",
    "so we are left in the unsatisfying position of not knowing when the method works , or why . in some cases",
    "it ( apparently ) captures all the attractors , while in other cases it does not .",
    "how does one make sense of all this ?",
    "a possible clue is that in all the cases where the method has so far been successful , the individual oscillators were chosen to have randomly distributed frequencies ; whereas in the cases where it failed , the oscillators were _",
    "identical_. perhaps the mixing induced by frequency dispersion is somehow relevant here ?",
    "a resolution of these issues may come from a new analytical approach .",
    "pikovsky and rosenblum  @xcite and mirollo , marvel and strogatz  @xcite have independently shown how to place the ott - antonsen ansatz  @xcite in a more general mathematical framework by relating it to the group of mobius transformations  @xcite or , equivalently , to a trigonometric transformation  @xcite originally introduced in the study of josephson arrays  @xcite .",
    "this approach includes the ott - antonsen ansatz as a special case , but is more powerful in the sense that it provably captures _ all _ the dynamics of the full system , and it works for any @xmath12 , not just in the infinite-@xmath12 limit .",
    "the drawback is that the analysis becomes more complicated .",
    "it remains to be seen what conclusions can be drawn  and , perhaps , what longstanding problems can be solved  when this new approach is unleashed on the kuramoto model and its many relatives .",
    "even in those instances where the ott - antonsen ansatz does nt account for all the attractors of the full system , it can still provide useful information , for instance by giving at least some of the attractors and by easing the calculation of them .",
    "moreover , the transient evolution from initial conditions off the ott - antonsen invariant manifold can yield interesting phenomena not captured by the ansatz , as discussed in appendix c of @xcite .      now returning to the specific problem of the bimodal kuramoto model : what happens if the humps in the bimodal distribution have unequal weights ?",
    "the analysis could proceed as in this paper , up to the point where we assumed symmetry between the two sub - populations .",
    "one would expect new phenomena such as traveling waves to arise because of the broken symmetry .",
    "we have focused here exclusively on the infinite-@xmath12 limit of the kuramoto model .",
    "what happens when the number of oscillators is reduced ?",
    "how do finite - size effects influence the bifurcation diagram ?",
    "an analysis along the lines of  @xcite could be fruitful for investigating these questions .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to test some of these theoretical ideas in real systems .",
    "one promising candidate is the electrochemical oscillator system studied by hudson and colleagues @xcite , in which the frequency distribution can be bimodal or even multimodal @xcite .",

    "the system in eq .",
