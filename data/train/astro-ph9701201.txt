    "to measure the spectrum of density fluctuations is one of the key issues in discussing the structure formation in the universe .",
    "clusters of galaxies are suitable objects to measure the spectrum on scales of @xmath13 mpc , where @xmath2 is the hubble constant in units of 100 @xmath3 .",
    "this is because the abundance of clusters is sensitive to the nature of the spectrum , in particular the amplitude , and because the fluctuations on cluster scales can be reliably discussed by linear theory .",
    "henry & arnaud ( 1991 ) derived @xmath14 and @xmath15 from the x - ray temperature function of clusters for @xmath16 universes , where @xmath0 is the rms linear fluctuation on scales of @xmath1 , @xmath8 is the cosmological density parameter , and they assumed that the density spectrum is approximated by a power law in wavenumber as @xmath17 on cluster scales .",
    "white , efstathiou , & frenk ( 1993a ) obtained @xmath18 using the spatial number density of rich clusters .",
    "similar results for @xmath0 were also obtained by other authors for open and spatially flat cold dark matter ( cdm ) models using henry & arnaud s ( 1991 ) temperature function data ; eke , cole , & frenk ( 1996 ) found @xmath19 and viana & liddle ( 1996 ) found @xmath20 ; in both estimates @xmath21 varies from @xmath22 to @xmath23 depending on the dark matter model assumed .",
    "there is , however , a problem with those measurements of @xmath0 that one can not know @xmath0 unless @xmath8 is given ; in general , the measured quantity is not @xmath0 but a combination of @xmath0 and @xmath8 like @xmath24 .",
    "this problem is common to almost all methods for measuring @xmath0 , such as the one using the peculiar velocity field of galaxies .    in this paper , we measure observationally the fraction of baryons confined in clusters of galaxies to the total baryons in the universe using the cluster gas mass function , and give @xmath8-independent measurements of @xmath0 by comparing the observed baryon fraction with the theoretical prediction . as will be seen in ",
    "@xmath253 , the theoretical derivation of the baryon fraction does not depend on @xmath8 , since the baryon fraction measures essentially the fraction of density fluctuations with an overdensity larger than the critical value .",
    "we find @xmath4 , with the quoted errors including the uncertainties in @xmath2 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the power - law index of the spectrum , @xmath26 , is also measured .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in  @xmath252 we derive the cluster gas mass function from the observed sample and compute the fraction of baryons confined in rich clusters . in ",
    "@xmath253 , we describe an analytic model of gravitational halo formation to predict the fraction of mass confined in dark haloes with a given mass range . in ",
    "@xmath254 , we estimate @xmath0 and @xmath26 .",
    "we also derive constraints on three sets of cdm models and a set of cold @xmath12 hot dark matter ( chdm ) models in  @xmath254 . finally ,  @xmath255 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we first derive the gas mass function of clusters from x - ray data , and then estimate the fraction of baryons confined in clusters with a given gas mass range . ebeling et al .",
    "( 1996a ) constructed an x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) of clusters of galaxies from the _",
    "rosat_brightest cluster sample , which is an x - ray selected , flux limited sample of 172 clusters compiled from _ rosat_all - sky survey data .",
    "they found that the xlf is well fitted by a schechter function : @xmath27 with @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 . here , @xmath31 is the x - ray luminosity in the @xmath32 kev band .",
    "ebeling et al .",
    "( 1996b ) presented an x - ray sample of 242 abell clusters from _ rosat_all - sky survey data in which x - ray luminosity in the @xmath32 kev band is tabulated . among those ,",
    "the gas mass within the abell ( 1958 ) radius ( @xmath33 mpc ) is given for 40 clusters in jones & forman ( 1984 ) and arnaud et al .",
    "the abell radius is close to the typical virialization radius of rich clusters , and thus it is reasonable to suppose that most of the cluster gas is within the abell radius . from the luminosity and the gas mass data of the forty clusters , we find @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath31 is in units of @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the gas mass within the abell radius . when estimating the errors in the coefficients of the @xmath31-@xmath37 relation ( eq.[2 ] ) , we assume that the observed @xmath37 for each cluster has an error of @xmath38 , which is the typical scatter of the data points around equation ( 2 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the distribution of the forty clusters on the @xmath31 - @xmath37 plane .    from the xlf and the @xmath31 - @xmath37 relation , we obtain the gas mass function : @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41   d \\left ( { { m_{\\rm gas}}\\over{{m_\\star } } } \\right ) ( h^3\\ { \\rm mpc}^{-3}),\\ ] ] where @xmath42",
    "this gas mass function is consistent with the ( cumulative ) gas mass function derived by burns et al .",
    "( 1996 ) using optically selected poor and rich clusters .",
    "we now compute the fraction of baryons confined in rich clusters .",
    "this calculation consists of three steps : ( 1 ) derive the gas density in the universe contributed from clusters , @xmath43 , from equation ( 3 ) ; ( 2 ) add to @xmath43 the contribution from the stellar mass of cluster galaxies to obtain the baryon density contributed from clusters , @xmath44 ; ( 3 ) compute the baryon fraction @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the mean baryon density in the universe predicted by the big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "first , we compute @xmath43 by @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the lower and upper limits of cluster gas mass .",
    "since the xlf and @xmath31 - @xmath37 relation are available over @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively , we set @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) , which corresponds to @xmath54 ( @xmath36 ) . performing the integration in equation ( 4 ) , in order to evaluate the errors in @xmath43 more easily .",
    "] we obtain @xmath55 which is translated into the density parameter @xmath56 .",
    "this value of @xmath57 agrees roughly with what persic & salucci ( 1992 ) obtained for a somewhat narrower mass range of clusters , @xmath58 , from an analysis using another xlf derived before _",
    "rosat_.    we fit the observed gas mass function by a power law over the range of @xmath48 and @xmath49 to find @xmath59 this power - law index will also be used to put constraints on the density fluctuation spectrum , in particular its slope .",
    "second , we add the contribution from the stellar mass of galaxies in clusters to @xmath43 . according to white et al .",
    "( 1993b ) , the mass ratio of the stellar component to the hot gas is @xmath60 for the coma cluster .",
    "since coma is a typical rich cluster , we assume that other clusters have the same ratio . under this assumption",
    ", the density of baryons in clusters , @xmath44 , is calculated by @xmath61 finally , let us derive @xmath62 .",
    "the density parameter of baryons in the universe , @xmath63 , is estimated using the big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "we take walker et al.s ( 1991 ) estimate : @xmath64 .",
    "we do not adopt recent estimates based on the deuterium abundance in qso absorption systems , because they are still quite controversial ( _ e.g. _ , carswell et al .",
    "1996 ; rugers & hogan 1996 ; tytler , fan , & burles 1996 ; wampler 1996 ) .",
    "since @xmath65 ( @xmath66 is the critical matter density and @xmath67 is the hubble constant ) , we obtain @xmath68 the errors are at @xmath69 levels and include both the errors in equation ( 5 ) and in @xmath63 .",
    "in this section we derive analytically the fraction of matter confined in haloes with a given mass range , based on the gravitational halo formation model .",
    "the press - schechter ( 1974 ) theory predicts the number density of haloes with a comoving radius @xmath70 as @xmath71 @xmath72     dr,\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the critical linear overdensity and @xmath74 is the rms of the linear density fluctuations in top - hat windows of radius @xmath70 ; @xmath0 is defined as @xmath75 .",
    "the fraction of matter in the universe which is confined in haloes with @xmath76 is expressed as @xmath77 here , @xmath78 is the total mass of the halo with a comoving radius @xmath70 and @xmath79 .",
    "we assume that the total mass of haloes is within the abell radius .",
    "since @xmath80 equation ( 10 ) is rewritten as @xmath81 we then assume that the baryon - to - total mass ratio of haloes is equal to @xmath82 .",
    "this assumption is reasonable because @xmath83-body simulations to date have suggested that hydrodynamical effects do not significantly influence the baryon - to - total mass ratio within the abell radius ( _ e.g. _ , white et al .",
    "1993b ; lubin et al .",
    "1996 and references therein ) .",
    "thus , a cluster with a baryon mass @xmath84 have a total mass @xmath85 , and thus have a comoving radius : @xmath86 equations ( 9 ) , ( 12 ) , and ( 13 ) show that @xmath87 , which is equal to @xmath62 by the assumption above , is computed if @xmath74 , @xmath46 , and the lower and upper limits of @xmath84 are given .",
    "we take @xmath88 throughout this paper for simplicity , because @xmath73 depends on @xmath8 and the cosmological constant @xmath89 only weakly ( _ e.g. _ , lilje 1992 ; lacey & cole 1993 ) .",
    "in this subsection , we assume that the density fluctuation spectrum is a power law on cluster scales : @xmath90 and estimate @xmath0 and @xmath26 from @xmath62 and the slope of the gas mass function .    figure 2 shows the constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath26 .",
    "results are shown for two extreme values of @xmath2 , since the observed and predicted baryon fractions depend on @xmath2 ( see eqs.[8 ] and [ 13 ] ) .",
    "the two values of @xmath2 taken here , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , roughly correspond to the lower and upper limits of recent measurements , respectively ( see , _ e.g. , _ freedman 1996 ) . the region between the two thick ( thin ) solid lines indicates the range allowed by the baryon fraction , @xmath62 , for @xmath93 ( 0.8 ) ; for each @xmath2 , the region corresponds to the @xmath94 range of @xmath62 ( eq.[8 ] ) .",
    "the region between the two thick ( thin ) dashed lines is for the constraint from the slope of the gas mass function for @xmath93 ( 0.8 ) ; for each @xmath2 , the region corresponds to the @xmath94 range of the slope ( eq.[6 ] ) . in deriving the constraint from the slope of the gas mass function",
    ", we fit the theoretical mass function with a power law , @xmath95 , over the range of @xmath96 corresponding to the gas mass range ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 in ",
    "@xmath253 ) , and compare @xmath97 with the power - law index of equation ( 6 ) . we see in figure 2 two features common to the @xmath93 and 0.8 cases .",
    "first , @xmath62 places almost the unique constraint on @xmath0 irrespective of @xmath26 .",
    "this is because @xmath98 is the typical comoving radius of rich clusters .",
    "second , a higher @xmath0 is required for a higher @xmath26 to reproduce the observed slope of the gas mass function .    from figure 2",
    "we find the allowed values of @xmath0 and @xmath26 to be @xmath99 for @xmath93 , and @xmath100 for @xmath101 ; a lower @xmath2 gives a lower @xmath0 .",
    "adopting @xmath6 as the observational uncertainty in @xmath2 , we can express the range of @xmath0 by @xmath102 in the rest of this subsection , we compare @xmath0 obtained above with those from @xmath8-dependent analyses to date , and then estimate @xmath8 .",
    "henry & arnaud ( 1991 ) derived @xmath14 and @xmath103 from the cluster temperature function assuming @xmath16 .",
    "the value of @xmath26 they obtained agrees very well with what we obtain above .",
    "white et al . ( 1993a ) derived @xmath18 using the cumulative abundance of rich clusters . the basic procedures by henry & arnaud ( 1991 ) and white et al .",
    "( 1993a ) to measure @xmath0 are the same in the sense that both of them used the cluster abundance and applied the press - schechter ( 1974 ) theory .",
    "thus , white et al.s ( 1993a ) estimate of @xmath0 for arbitrary @xmath8 may be regarded as a generalization of henry & arnaud s ( 1991 ) .",
    "another method for measuring @xmath0 is to use the peculiar velocity field of galaxies , though a large inconsistency is seen among recent measurements .",
    "two representative measurements are those given in kolatt & dekel ( 1997 ) and willick et al .",

    "willick et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found @xmath105 , applying another technique to the same catalog .",

    "measurement we obtain @xmath113 ( @xmath93 ) and @xmath114 ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "finally , willick et al.s ( 1996 ) @xmath9 gives @xmath115 ( @xmath93 ) and @xmath116 ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "we then compare these values with that computed from the cluster baryon - to - total mass ratio and @xmath63 .",
