    "insulin secretion from pancreatic @xmath0 cells is critical for glucose homeostasis in blood .",
    "perturbations from the basal glucose concentration induce various oscillations with different periods in pancreatic @xmath0 cells : fast oscillations with periods of several seconds  @xcite , slow oscillations with periods of several minutes  @xcite , and ultradian oscillations with periods of a few hours  @xcite .",
    "each type of oscillations has been studied separately , within the respective model according to each time scale .",
    "for example , slow oscillations can be caused by a feedback mechanism having slow reaction time  @xcite .",
    "independently of this , a microscopic model for the bursting mechanism of the membrane potential in a @xmath0 cell was devised and investigated  @xcite while the bursting activity was also demonstrated in a simple two - dimensional map  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the microscopic bursting model , which was constructed in a similar manner to the hodgkin - huxley model for nerve excitation  @xcite , was improved by the introduction of the potassium ion k@xmath2 conductance depending dynamically on the atp concentration  @xcite .",
    "however , the correlations between the bursting mechanism and insulin secretion have not been addressed in an appropriate way and there still lacks a model describing the complex phenomena such as clusters of bursting action potentials  @xcite , fast and slow ca@xmath3 oscillations  @xcite , which arise from combined behaviors of different time scales .",
    "the purpose of this study is to propose a combined model , explaining both fast and slow oscillations of action potentials .    on the other hand , recent experimental investigations in vivo and in vitro about the oscillations of insulin secretion",
    "have revealed a more complex picture on the molecular basis .",
    "stimulation of insulin secretion by glucose involves a rise in the cytoplasmic concentration of calcium ions ( ca@xmath3 ) in @xmath0 cells .",
    "this rise essentially results from the following sequence of events , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ metabolism ] : glucose transported by glut-1 and glut-2 transporters in a @xmath0 cell raises the ratio of adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) to adenosine diphosphate ( adp ) , which promotes closure of atp - sensitive k@xmath2 channels .",
    "this generates membrane depolarization , urging voltage - dependent calcium channels to open .",
    "the subsequent increase in free cytosolic ca@xmath3 then stimulates insulin secretion  @xcite .",
    "note also that there are several experimental evidences for insulin to inhibit bursting of @xmath0 cells  @xcite ; in particular , there is a report that insulin activates atp - sensitive k@xmath2 channels in @xmath0 cells  @xcite .",
    "based on these experiments , we assume two possible inhibitory pathways of insulin : indirect effects on gating of k(atp ) channels by inhibiting glucose transport through glut-2 transporters by insulin and direct effects of insulin to activate the channel . both negative feedback processes of insulin to activate the channels may result in oscillatory behavior .",
    "oscillations of the membrane potential  @xcite drive oscillations of ca@xmath3  @xcite , leading in turn to oscillations of insulin secretion  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the measured portal - vein insulin secretion rate shows periodic behavior of insulin secretion with successive secretion and rest .",
    "the frequency of such pulsatile insulin secretion in vivo and that in vitro in an isolated perfused pancreas have been reported to vary from four to fifteen minutes and from six to ten minutes , respectively  @xcite .     +    these experimental results make it desirable to establish a model that can describe the whole feedback process on the microscopic level , with the aforementioned macroscopic features incorporated . as an attempt toward such a goal",
    ", we propose a model , connecting the macroscopic description of glucose regulation  @xcite and the microscopic mechanism of bursting behavior of @xmath0 cells  @xcite via the prescription based on experimental observations : the conductance @xmath1 for the k(atp ) current , i.e. , the k@xmath2 current through the atp - dependent k@xmath2 channel , is taken to be a decreasing function of the intracellular glucose concentration whereas it is assumed that the insulin secretion rate depends on the intracellular ca@xmath3 concentration . for the macroscopic description ,",
    "we consider two possible insulin induced inhibitory pathways affecting the conductance @xmath1 . in addition , electrical coupling through gap junctions between @xmath0 cells in an islet is assumed .",
    "obtained via extensive numerical simulations are a variety of oscillatory behavior of the bursting electrical activity , calcium concentration , and insulin secretion , which are in good agreement with those observed experimentally .",
    "there are four sections in this paper : section ii introduces the model system , described by coupled differential equations , together with the appropriate parameters .",
    "the coupled equations are integrated numerically and the results are presented in sec .",
    "finally , a detailed discussion , together with a brief summary , is given in sec .",
    "to describe the whole feedback process , we incorporate the bursting mechanism of @xmath0 cells given by sherman  @xcite and the description of glucose - insulin oscillations by maki and keizer  @xcite .",
    "we begin with the dynamic equation for the time - dependent behavior of the membrane potential @xmath4 of the @xmath5th @xmath0 cell  @xcite : @xmath6 which describes current balance with the relaxation time @xmath7 .",
    "the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) includes contributions from various current channels , which are all given in units of voltage ( i.e. , with the dimensionless conductance as below ) : calcium current @xmath8 , potassium current @xmath9 , generic slow current @xmath10 , and background current @xmath11 through the atp - dependent potassium channel .",
    "the last term , where the prime in the summation stands for the restriction that @xmath12 be a nearest neighbor of @xmath5 , represents the electrical coupling via gap junctions of ( dimensionless ) conductance @xmath13 between nearest neighboring cells in an islet .",
    "the first three types of current depend on the membrane potential @xmath4 and on the gating variables @xmath14 or @xmath15 , and are given by @xmath16 with constant ( dimensionless ) conductances @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 and the reversal potentials @xmath20 and @xmath21 for ca@xmath3 and k@xmath2 ions , respectively .",
    "the gating variables @xmath14 and @xmath15 are governed by the equations @xmath22",

    "thus the calcium current has been assumed to respond instantaneously to a change in the membrane potential via the voltage - dependent activation @xmath25 while the potassium current is governed by the gating variable @xmath14 via eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) .",
    "these two currents are responsible for generating the action potential during the active phase of bursting .",
    "the generic slow current , which may corresponds to the inhibitory potassium current , is gated by the slow variable @xmath15 via eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) and responsible for switching between the active and silent phases .",

    "on the other hand , @xmath11 , which is responsible for setting the plateau fraction , i.e. , the ratio of the active phase duration to the burst period , satisfies @xmath33 where the conductance @xmath1 depends on the glucose concentration and @xmath34 is the opening probability of the k(atp ) channel . in general , an increase in the intracellular glucose concentration due to injection of glucose raises the atp / adp ratio after being metabolized ; this in turn reduces @xmath1 and induces depolarization of the membrane potential  @xcite .",
    "considering the time delay in this process , i.e. , between the increase of the intracellular glucose concentration @xmath35 and the reduction of the conductance @xmath1 , we assume that @xmath1 at time @xmath36 is a decreasing function of @xmath35 at time @xmath37 , where the delay time @xmath38 measures the time needed for metabolizing glucose transported into the @xmath0 cell .",
    "to be specific , we take the hill equation  @xcite : @xmath39^b f_d(j_i ) + 1 } + g_2,\\ ] ] with the appropriate hill coefficient @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "note the sharp contrast to the constant @xmath1 in existing studies on the bursting mechanism  @xcite or to the case that @xmath1 is taken to be a function of atp  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath42 represent the maximum and minimum values of @xmath1 , respectively , whereas @xmath43 is the value of @xmath35 for which @xmath1 reduces to its medium value @xmath44 .",
    "the function @xmath45 describes possible direct effects of insulin on @xmath1 .",
    "namely , while we have simply @xmath46 in the absence of such direct effects , in their presence we take @xmath45 to be a decreasing function @xmath47 of the inhibition variable @xmath48 : @xmath49 with the inhibition variable governed by @xmath50 the ( slow ) relaxation time @xmath51 and the constant @xmath52 depend on the pathway , whereas @xmath53 is taken to be an increasing function of the insulin concentration @xmath54 : @xmath55 with appropriate constant @xmath56 ( see table i ) .",
    "although there are many sources of noise in a biological system , we here restrict ourselves only to the stochastic opening and closing of ion channels , in particular those of k(atp ) channels , and assume that the dynamics of the opening probability @xmath34 in the @xmath5th cell is described by the stochastic differential equation  @xcite @xmath57 with appropriate constants @xmath58 and @xmath59 and relaxation time @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the gaussian white noise with zero mean and variance @xmath62 note that as the number @xmath63 of k(atp ) channels per cell grows large ( @xmath64 ) , we have @xmath65 and obtain the usual deterministic equation for @xmath34 .    modifying the model for a perifusion system  @xcite , we now obtain equations describing glucose regulation . in view of the perifusion , we consider conservation of insulin and write the equation for the insulin concentration @xmath54 around the @xmath5th cell in the form : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the rate of insulin secretion , @xmath68 is the flow rate for each cell , and @xmath69 is the background concentration . the effective volume @xmath70 of a @xmath0 cell is given by the volume of the islet divided by the number of @xmath0 cells in it .",
    "experimental observations indicate that insulin secretion from @xmath0 cells increases with the intracellular calcium concentration and with the amount of insulin stored for rapid secretion  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the secretion rate is known to depend on the ca@xmath3 concentration quartically .",
    "we thus assume a quartic function of the concentration @xmath71 of the free intracellular ca@xmath3 : @xmath72 where @xmath73 sets the scale , @xmath74 is the rescaled ( dimensionless ) calcium concentration defined to be @xmath75 with the background value @xmath76 and the appropriate scale @xmath77 , and @xmath78 is the storage amount of insulin preparing rapid secretion in the readily releasable vesicle pool ( rrvp ) of the @xmath0-cell , with the maximum value @xmath79 .",
    "the latter changes according to the relation @xmath80 where the refilling rate @xmath81 of insulin granules to the rrvp is proportional to the remaining amount : @xmath82 with appropriate constant @xmath83 .",
    "the ca@xmath3 concentration @xmath71 in the @xmath5th cell is governed by the rate equation : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the fraction of free ca@xmath3 ions in the cytosolic compartments , @xmath86 is the proportionality constant between the current flow and the concentration reduction rate .",

    "the last term @xmath100 represents the flux out of the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) and is described by @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the rate of ca@xmath3 release from the er and @xmath103 denotes the ca@xmath3 concentration in the er . the latter is governed by the rate equation @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the fraction of free ca@xmath3 ions in the er , @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the volumes of the cytosolic and of the er compartments , respectively  @xcite .",

    "we thus take the rates through glut-1 and glut-2 transporters to be simple increasing functions of the extracellular glucose concentration @xmath111 and choose an increasing function of the intracellular glucose concentration @xmath35 for the metabolism rate : @xmath112   r_2 & = & \\frac{c_2 ( g_0 -g_{in})f_i(j_i)}{(1+g_0/k_2)(k_2 + g_{in } ) } \\\\ [ 1 mm ] r_m & = & \\frac{c_m g_{in}}{k_m + g_{in}}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the constants @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 are determined from experimental results , whereas the constants @xmath118 and @xmath119 are chosen to yield appropriate intracellular glucose concentrations in simulations .",
    "note that @xmath120 has been taken to be an increasing function of @xmath54 , which models the recruitment of glut-1 transporters by insulin and results in positive feedback . on the other hand , to take into account indirect effects of insulin on @xmath1",
    ", @xmath121 has been chosen to depend on the function @xmath122 of the inhibition variable @xmath48 , which accounts for inhibitory effects of insulin on its own release via the inhibition of glut-2 ; this assumption is made as a possible interpretation of the recent observation of the inhibiting role of insulin  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , @xmath121 tends to decrease as the insulin concentration is raised .",
    "note in particular that unlike the form in the existing study  @xcite , @xmath121 in the above form always remains positive , thus avoiding the unphysiological case of negative values . to complete the model",
    ", we assume the two - step process in a @xmath0 cell , which includes manifestation of the inhibitory signal from insulin receptors in the presence of insulin ( first step ) and the inhibition of glut-2 transporters by that signal ( second step ) ; this provides the slow negative feedback process , which may again be described by the decreasing function @xmath47 ( for the direct effects before ) with appropriate values of the parameters .    the whole feedback model is thus described by the ten coupled equations [ eqs .",
    "( [ v ] ) - ( [ gbeta ] ) ] for the ten variables , together with the equations giving dependence on those variables .",
    "it should be stressed that the bursting mechanism and the glucose regulation are incorporated , with the glucose - dependent conductance @xmath1 and the calcium - dependent rate of insulin secretion as well as the insulin - dependent rate of glucose uptake playing the role of a bridge between the two .",
    "the appropriate values of the parameters used in the whole model are given in table i.    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +     +    there are reports that insulin itself inhibits insulin secretion in @xmath0-cells although the exact mechanism is not clear  @xcite . specifically , experimental data seem to suggest that the negative feedback of insulin acts directly on atp - dependent k@xmath2 channels , suppressing action potential firing  @xcite . to examine this direct pathway , we set @xmath123 , @xmath124 with @xmath125 , and @xmath126 mm , varying the relaxation time @xmath51 .",
    "figure  [ dir_v ] exhibits the resulting oscillatory behaviors of the membrane potential for @xmath127min , depending on the extracellular glucose concentration @xmath111 .",
    "the average duration of bursting is rather insensitive to @xmath111 , approximately 16 seconds for a wide range of @xmath111 .",
    "compared with the results of the indirect pathway , the duration time is short and the dose - response to glucose is also weak in the direct pathway . on the other hand , the average period between bursts decreases with @xmath111 , which results in more insulin secretion at higher glucose levels . unlike the indirect pathway , however , the clustering of bursts does not emerge in the direct pathway . since the secreted insulin affects the atp - dependent k@xmath2 channels directly and rapidly",
    ", there is not enough time to activate the mechanism for bursting clusters .",
    "the behavior of the intracellular glucose concentration @xmath35 is shown in fig .",
    "[ dir_gi ] , for the extracellular glucose concentration @xmath128 mm and the relaxation time @xmath127min .",
    "no prominent slow oscillations are observed ( compare with fig .  [ gi_s ] ) .",
    "figure  [ burstperio_tauj ] shows how the average bursting period @xmath60 depends on the relaxation time @xmath51 : observed is a rapid increase of @xmath60 , followed by saturation to @xmath129min , as @xmath51 is raised .    to obtain bursting clusters via the direct pathway ,",
    "one needs another formal time delay and accordingly , an additional process in insulin inhibition . as an attempt",
    ", we consider delay @xmath130 in the direct activation factor , i.e. , @xmath131 on the conductance of the atp - dependent k@xmath2 channel , and show the results in fig .",
    "[ dubustatdir ] .",
    "it is observed that the total duration time @xmath132 of a bursting cluster grows almost linearly with the delay @xmath130 .",
    "when @xmath130 is small , we have @xmath133 and there is no regular bursting patterns .",
    "when @xmath130 is raised to @xmath134min , clustering patterns of bursts begin to appear ; the corresponding behavior of the membrane potential is displayed in the upper inset panel . as @xmath130 is increased further , the bursting duration time keeps growing and the bursting pattern at @xmath135min becomes similar to that via the indirect pathway shown in fig .",
    "[ poten_s](c ) .",
    "nevertheless it is rather difficult to recognize this direct pathway as an appropriate mechanism for bursting clusters since such large delay is apparently not consistent with experimental results  @xcite .",
    "our model has employed the glucose - insulin feedback for slow dynamics , responsible for slow oscillations in the system . unlike the fast oscillations of bursting action potentials ,",
    "however , the origin of the slow oscillations with periods about 5 to 10 minutes is not understood well and still in controversy .",
    "one of the main difficulties lies in identifying the primary oscillation among many secondary ones . indeed in a pancreas ,",
    "many chemical ingredients , e.g. , ca@xmath3 , o@xmath136 , atp , glucose , and insulin , show oscillatory behaviors with periods of several minutes  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been reported that glycolysis produces spontaneous oscillations in @xmath0-cells : here ca@xmath3 acts as a mediator , transducing oscillatory metabolism into oscillatory secretion  @xcite .",
    "after completion of the first version of the manuscript , we became aware of the recent work , which addresses the multiple bursting mode in pancreatic islets , with glycolysis adopted as the slow dynamics  @xcite .",
    "in the present study , on the other hand , we have proposed another possible mechanism for slow oscillations , namely , the negative feedback through the product ( i.e. , insulin ) in response to the stimulus ( glucose ) .    in combining the slow dynamics ( glucose - insulin feedback ) with the fast dynamics ( bursting action potentials ) , we have allowed both dynamics to interact bidirectionally . as a result , there emerge mixed oscillations of both time scales , clusters of bursts , when the two dynamics complement each other via the indirect pathway .",
    "this also keeps parallel with the glycolytic model  @xcite , and contrasts with the unidirectionally interacting model where slow dynamics of glycolysis influences fast dynamics one - sidedly  @xcite .",
    "we now discuss the plausibility of our model , in comparison with others .",
    "insulin secretion is synchronized among the @xmath0 cells in an islet , which has been observed in the calcium imaging experiment  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the pulsatile insulin secretion in a group of islets indicates additional synchronization among islets in a pancreas ; otherwise the secreted insulin from many islets , having different phases from each other , would produce essentially a constant level of insulin  @xcite , although there may exist a source of some controversy  @xcite . such synchronization among islets",
    "may not be explained by the model adopting glycolysis as the slow dynamics , where no communication is available between islets .",
    "an expanded model was also proposed , incorporating glucose release in the liver : secreted insulin causes oscillations of the plasma glucose through the liver , which in turn entrain all islets with its characteristic frequency  @xcite .",
    "this is , however , in disagreement with pulsatile insulin secretion at constant glucose concentration observed in vitro  @xcite and in vivo  @xcite . on the other hand , in our feedback model",
    ", secreted insulin from an islet affects other islets ( via the paracrine interaction ) as well as the islet itself ( via the autocrine interaction ) , thus inherently allowing synchronization among islets even at a constant plasma glucose level .",
    "accordingly , our model can explain the sustained insulin oscillations at constant glucose concentration observed in vitro and in vivo  @xcite .",
    "further , the recent observation that defects in irs-1 , associated with the reduced expression of the serca protein , result in lack of slow calcium oscillations and reduction of insulin secretion  @xcite is also supportive of the insulin feedback mechanism . note , however , that the molecules for negative feedback are not necessarily limited to insulin and other products , e.g. , gaba , can also provide the feedback pathway  @xcite .    in constructing a model for such complex biological systems , one may not expect perfection and impeccableness , and there are certainly some drawbacks in our feedback model as well .",
    "first , our model predicts that both the amplitude and the period of the insulin oscillation increase with the plasma glucose concentration , which apparently does not agree with the report that mainly the amplitude tends to change  @xcite .",
    "secondly , slow oscillations are still observed in experiment on single @xmath0 cells , even when the flow rate of the local perfusion is too fast for secreted insulin to reach the insulin receptor and to operate the feedback mechanism  @xcite . in this case",
    "the other model adopting glycolysis as slow dynamics is still applicable since the glycolytic oscillation may still occur without the feedback through a product like insulin  @xcite . in summary",
    ", we have incorporated the macroscopic description of glucose regulation and the microscopic mechanism of bursting behavior of @xmath0 cells , to establish a model that displays inherently the observed oscillations of the membrane potential , cytosolic calcium concentration , and insulin secretion in pancreatic islets . in view of the experimental observations ,",
    "the atp - dependent conductance @xmath1 of the k@xmath2 channel has been taken as a decreasing function of the glucose concentration whereas the insulin secretion rate has been given by an increasing function of the intracellular ca@xmath3 concentration .",
    "considered here are two possible insulin induced inhibitory pathways , affecting the conductance @xmath1 .",
    "further , @xmath0 cells in an islet have been considered to be coupled electrically with their nearest neighbors with appropriate coupling conductance . by means of extensive numerical simulations ,",
    "we have obtained bursting electrical activities , calcium concentration , and insulin secretion , which are consistent with those observed experimentally .",
    "in addition to the stationary - state behaviors , we have also examined how the intracellular glucose concentration changes with the extracellular glucose concentration , and explored the behaviors of the system as the injected glucose concentration is varied successively .",
    "then the inhibition effects of insulin on the bursting action potential have been probed .",
    "finally , we have compared two possible pathways to the feedback modulations of @xmath1 by secreted insulin . with appropriate parameters , the indirect feedback mechanism has been found to generate bursting clusters of action potentials . on the other hand ,",
    "the direct mechanism in general generates only single bursts ; it requires , e.g. , rather unrealistically long delay time to produce bursting clusters .",
    "our model may thus serve as a useful framework to predict insulin secretion modulated by the molecular mechanism in @xmath0 cells and the corresponding glucose regulation .",
    "in particular , our model , based on the glucose - insulin feedback , can be a good complement to the glycolytic model .",
    "extensions toward a more realistic description of the biological situation are left for further study .",

    "<S> a variety of oscillations are observed in pancreatic islets . we establish a model , incorporating two oscillatory systems of different time scales : </S>",
    "<S> one is the well - known bursting model in pancreatic @xmath0-cells and the other is the glucose - insulin feedback model which considers direct and indirect feedback of secreted insulin . </S>",
    "<S> these two are coupled to interact with each other in the combined model , and two basic assumptions are made on the basis of biological observations : the conductance @xmath1 for the atp - dependent potassium current is a decreasing function of the glucose concentration whereas the insulin secretion rate is given by a function of the intracellular calcium concentration . </S>",
    "<S> obtained via extensive numerical simulations are complex oscillations including clusters of bursts , slow and fast calcium oscillations , and so on . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider how the intracellular glucose concentration depends upon the extracellular glucose concentration , and examine the inhibitory effects of insulin . </S>"
