    "this is a standard procedure in the loop quantum cosmology .    in this paper",
    "we calculate and study another non - vanishing contribution what is in fact a choice of the different regularisation of the expression for the field strength .",

    "this fact indicates that higher order corrections from holonomies can have important influence for dynamical behaviour for small values of @xmath56 .",
    "it is clear from a parameter of expansion ( [ mubar ] ) which grows for small values of @xmath56 . for large @xmath56 the classical case",
    "is clearly recovered , however behaviour for small values of @xmath56 is highly complicated .",
    "namely , as our study suggests higher order terms of expansion have nonperturbative influence for dynamics and this fact can seriously complicate a simple bouncing universe picture .",
    "we investigate this issue in the next section .",
    "the advantage of qualitative methods of analysis of differential equations @xcite is that we obtain all evolutional paths for all admissible initial conditions . in this approach the evolution of the system",
    "is represented by trajectories in the phase space and asymptotic states by critical points .",
    "we demonstrate that dynamics of the model can be reduced to 2-dimensional autonomous dynamical system .",
    "these methods allow to distinguish a generic evolutional scenario .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we show the phase portrait for all admissible initial conditions ( all values of total energy @xmath8 of the fictitious particle moving in a @xmath71-dimensional potential proportional to @xmath72 ) for the model with the free scalar field .",
    "the physical trajectories are situated in the region at which @xmath73 is non - negative or @xmath56 is larger than some minimal value and @xmath74 is zero . the physical trajectories lie in the non - shaded region bounded by a zero velocity curve which represents a homoclinic orbit .",
    "of course the whole system is symmetric with respect to the reflection ( @xmath75 is changed in @xmath76 ) . the blue line on the phase portrait represents points at which trajectories pass horizontally through the inflection point ( _ hyper - inflationary / deflationary _ phases ) .",
    "therefore , evolution comprises the bounce solution interpolating static phases of evolution , see fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "there is the intermediate phase of evolution at which we have the inflection point at the diagram of @xmath77 .",
    "note that it is the singularity state with rapid growth of the scale factor , we call this phase the hyper - inflation .",
    "it is important to note that energy density is finite during transition through these singularities .",
    "similar finite scale factor singularities has been studied recently by cannata  _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .        in the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we adjoint a circle at infinity in standard way via poincare construction .",
    "note that all trajectories are starting from unstable node - representing static einstein universe and landing at stable node representing another static einstein universe .",
    "parisi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite pointed out that stability of einstein static models in high - energy modifications of general relativity is important from the point of view of so - called emergent universe scenario @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the stability of the einstein static model and they found that lqc einstein static model is representing a centre type of critical point on the phase portrait . as it is well known such a critical point is structurally unstable .",
    "note that in our case this static universe is representing a node type of critical point .",
    "this modification of stability in presented model has important consequences for the emergent universe scenario , since as it is well known in general relativity , a static universe is unstable and is represented by a saddle type of critical point and therefore it requires the fine - tuning .",
    "moreover corrections considered lead to a regularization of the big - bang singularity @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have calculated another non - vanishing contribution to the quantum holonomy correction in loop quantum gravity .",
    "quantum correction of this kind appears when we express the ashtekar connection @xmath6 and field strength @xmath4 in terms of holonomies .",
    "the source of quantum modification to classical expressions is a non - vanishing area enclosed by loop as the result of existence of the area gap @xmath14 .",
    "we had applied obtained corrections to the flat frw cosmological model and the we have calculated resulting quantum gravitational modifications to the friedmann equation .",
    "the holonomy correction in the lowest order to the flat frw model has been calculated earlier @xcite and extensively studied @xcite .",
    "these investigations uncovered existence of the bounce for energy scales @xmath78 . in this picture",
    "the standard big bang singularity is replaced by the non - singular big bounce .",
    "calculations performed in the present paper indicate that the holonomy correction in the next non - vanishing order holds this picture .",
    "namely , the initial singularity is still preserved .",
    "however the bounce appears now for higher energy density @xmath2 .",
    "another important new feature is the appearance of a pole in the hubble parameter for @xmath79 corresponding to _ hyper - inflationary / deflationary _ phases .",
    "this leads to more complicated dynamical behaviour at these energy scales .",
    "we showed that the generic evolutional scenario for the model with the free scalar field starts from the static einstein universe then recolapse passing through the curvature singularity with a finite scale factor ( hyper - deflation ) towards the bounce and goes in the expanding phase through the second curvature singularity ( hyper - inflation ) and ends in the static einstein universe . during the transition through the singularities the universal critical behaviour @xmath80 holds .",
    "therefore in the presented scenario the bounce connects these two finite scale factor singularities .",
    "as we see , the higher order quantum correction in lqg can have an important influence on dynamical behaviour of cosmological models .",
    "it is not unlikely that the non - singular bounce appeared in the lowest order can be only an artifact of simplifications and can disappear when whole contribution will be taken into account .",
    "further investigations of quantum corrections from lqg are still necessary .",
    "we conclude that higher order holonomy corrections and resulting different quantization schemes should be also seriously taken into account in considerations .",
    "we thank to martin bojowald for useful comments and prof .",
