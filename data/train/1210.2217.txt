    "galaxy - galaxy interactions including mergers and collisions play important roles in galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "close interaction with other galaxies not only changes the morphology and the kinematics of stars and gas in a galaxy @xcite but also enhances star - formation ( sf ) activity . @xcite attribute large colour dispersion of interacting systems in colour - colour diagrams compared to isolated galaxies to bursts of sf in interacting galaxies .",
    "subsequent observational studies using tracers of sf such as h@xmath3 @xcite , far - infrared ( fir ) @xcite , mid - infrared ( mir ) @xcite and radio continuum @xcite all prove the enhancement of sf activity in interacting galaxies .",
    "these global and statistical studies show that a galaxy interaction makes a great contribution to sf activity of galaxies .",
    "sf occurs through a self - gravitational disruption of molecular gas clouds in interstellar space .",
    "it is very important to know how interstellar matter , especially , molecular gas is affected by interactions of galaxies to understand the mechanism of active sf in interacting galaxies . since infrared ( ir ) luminous galaxies are expected to have strong co emission , early co observations toward extragalaxies were mainly focused on luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) and ultra luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) whose ir luminosity is larger than 10@xmath5 and 10@xmath0 , respectively @xcite .",
    "although these observations revealed that lirgs have a large amount of molecular gas ( @xmath6 10@xmath7 ) and that there is a good correlation between co luminosity and ir luminosity , the reasons for the enhanced sf activity have not been well understood mainly due to low spatial resolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    with the improvement of receiver sensitivity , it has been possible to observe normal galaxies in co and to compare sf activity between lirgs and normal galaxies .",
    "the correlation between co and ir luminosities was still found for normal galaxies and high star formation efficiency ( sfe ) was found in interacting galaxies compared to normal spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "considering these results , @xcite suggest that interacting galaxies form stars more effectively than normal galaxies .",
    "recent observational studies , however , found some facts that oppose this scenario .",
    "statistical studies of interacting galaxies show that molecular gas mass in interacting galaxies is higher than that in field galaxies @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite also show that , contrary to the previous results , sfe is not higher in ulirgs where star formation rate ( sfr ) is higher than field galaxies .",
    "the discrepancies of sfe in previous papers occurred because past observations of molecular gas were pointed at only the centre of galaxies .",
    "for such observations , it is difficult to get even total co flux and a distribution of molecular gas in galaxies .",
    "@xcite showed that the enhancement of sfr begins in the mid stage of the interaction and most active sf happens at the late stage of the interaction classified by their morphologies .",
    "this fact suggests that the conditions of triggering starburst have been satisfied in earlier stages of the interaction .",
    "the key to the onset of starburst is suggested by the numerical simulations by @xcite .",
    "they revealed that gravitational torque makes interstellar gas infall into the central regions of progenitors during the interaction . since the density of interstellar gas increases at the central regions due to the gas infall , sf at the galactic centre takes place efficiently .",
    "high resolution interferometric co observations toward lirgs clarified that molecular gas in lirgs is concentrated in the central 1 kpc region @xcite .",
    "since most lirgs are regarded as being in the late stage of the interaction , measurements of the central concentration of molecular gas in earlier stage of the interaction are very important in order to explain when and how molecular gas falls into the nuclei .",
    "therefore , observations of interacting galaxies in earlier stages of the interaction are required .    to examine whether changes of molecular gas properties happen under the interaction ,",
    "it is necessary to observe molecular gas which covers the entire region of interacting galaxies with an enough spatial resolution to resolve their main structure .",
    "the 25-beam array receiver system ( bears ) @xcite equipped on the 45-m telescope at nro is one of the most suitable instruments for such observations .",
    "thus we conducted @xmath0co(_j _ = 1 - 0 ) mapping observations of interacting galaxies using the 45-m telescope .    in this paper , we present the data from our @xmath0co(_j _ = 1 - 0 ) mapping observations toward four interacting galaxies in the early and the mid stages of the interaction .",

    "the co data and comparisons to previous observations are presented in section [ results ] .",
    "central concentration of molecular gas and stars are discussed in section [ discussion ] .",
    "we will discuss molecular gas fraction and its relationship with star - forming activity in detail in forthcoming papers .",

    "that is , interacting galaxies whose @xmath8 were adopted as in the early stage of the interaction , where _ r _ is the separation between the nuclei and @xmath9 is the diameter of the primary galaxy , using the brightness contour @xmath10 = 25 mag arcsec@xmath11 , and showing small morphological disturbances .",

    "this discrepancy may be due to the high peculiar velocity of vv  219 in the cluster potential . since the fact of a projected distance between vv  219 and m 87 of 1 mpc suggests that vv  219 is located in the inner region of the virgo cluster , we adopt 16 mpc for the distance of vv  219 .",

    "the gas infall leads to an enhancement of the density of molecular gas in the central region of the galaxies and active sf will be triggered using the dense molecular gas .",
    "in fact , high molecular gas concentration has been found in late stage interacting galaxies such as arp  220 and ngc  520 whose sf is extremely active @xcite .    on the other hand , for early and mid stage interacting galaxies , @xcite claimed that molecular gas is not concentrated to the nucleus of progenitors as expected in numerical simulations .",
    "their observations , however , were carried out with the interferometer and mapped only central regions of the sample galaxies .",
    "the missing flux problem of the interferometer disables measurements of the degree of concentration of molecular gas .",
    "in addition , because of the limited observing area , it is difficult to know the actual distribution of molecular gas in the early and the mid stage of the interaction in which molecular gas is distributed over a relatively wide area in the galactic discs .",
    "hence , mapping observations of the whole region of the galaxy pair with a single - dish telescope are important to quantify concentration of molecular gas .    in this paper , molecular gas concentration",
    "is defined by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is molecular gas mass within a radius @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the radius at 20 mag arcsec@xmath11 in _ ks_-band .",
    "we took @xmath29 value from 2mass large galaxy atlas @xcite .",

    "the median of @xmath23 of interacting galaxies is 0.44 and the maximum is 0.49 , while the median of the control sample is 0.56 and the maximum is 0.91 .",
    "we performed the kolmogorov - smirnov test between two samples and found that the probability that both samples are extracted from the same parent sample is 0.02 .",
    "as mentioned in  [ comparison ] , @xmath23 of ngc  5394 may be underestimated because co extension is relatively small as compared to other galaxies .",
    "therefore we performed the kolmogorov - smirnov test assuming the @xmath23 value of 0.9 for ngc  5394 which is comparable with the maximum value of the control sample . even in this case",
    ", the possibility is 0.08 .",
    "this result implies that molecular gas is not accumulated toward the centre of interacting galaxies directly by the interaction and that there is a phase in which distribution of molecular gas is significantly disturbed .    for comparison",
    ", we also derived central concentration of stars , @xmath24 , using a _ ks_-band image which traces stellar mass . in the same manner as @xmath23 ,",

    "@xmath24 is listed in table [ flux ] and table [ isolate ] .",
    "the median of @xmath24 of interacting galaxies is 0.56 and the maximum is 0.79 , while the median of the control sample is 0.74 and the maximum is 0.87 .",
    "the result of the kolmogorov - smirnov test of 0.20 shows these two samples are from same parent , although the control sample has higher value of @xmath24 .",
    "these comparisons of @xmath23 and @xmath24 imply that both molecular gas and stars are disturbed by the interaction and that the interaction has a stronger effects on molecular gas than stars in the early stage of the interaction .",
    "our observational finding that distributions of molecular gas in the early stage of the interaction are larger than isolated spiral galaxies is consistent with recent simulations which treat feedback from sf and precise physics of interstellar medium @xcite , while previous simulations which adopt isothermal interstellar medium @xcite do not show a significantly disturbed distribution of gas .",
    "this fact indicates that direct comparisons can be done between observation and simulation about not merely of distribution of gas but sf associated with the change of physical properties which are discussed in upcoming papers .",
    "we made co mapping observations of interacting galaxies in the early and the mid stages of the interaction with the 45-m telescope at nro .",
    "our high quality co maps reveal that distribution of molecular gas differs from atomic gas , old stars and sf tracers suggesting the strong influence of the interaction even in the early stage of the interaction .",
    "some interacting galaxies show that molecular gas is lopsided to the area between two constituent galaxies .",
    "furthermore , we compared central concentration of molecular gas between interacting galaxies and isolated galaxies and found that the central concentration of molecular gas in interacting galaxies is lower than that in isolated galaxies .",
    "old stars also show interacting galaxies have lower central concentration than isolated galaxies but the difference is not so clear as compared with that of molecular gas .",
    "the results suggest that even in the early stage of the interaction the distribution of molecular gas is strongly disturbed by the interaction and there is a phase when the central concentration of molecular gas decreases before gas infall toward the galactic centre .",
