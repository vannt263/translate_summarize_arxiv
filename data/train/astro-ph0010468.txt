    "2000 ) confirmed the notion that the present large - scale structure in the universe originated from small - amplitude density fluctuations at early times . due to the natural instability of gravity , regions that were denser than average collapsed and formed bound objects , first on small spatial scales and later on larger and larger scales .",
    "the present - day abundance of bound objects , such as galaxies and x - ray clusters , can be explained based on an appropriate extrapolation of the detected anisotropies to smaller scales .",

    "the elementary building blocks , i.e. , the first gaseous objects to form , acquired a total mass of order the jeans mass ( @xmath3 ) , below which gas pressure opposed gravity and prevented collapse ( couchman & rees 1986 ; haiman & loeb 1997 ; ostriker & gnedin 1996 ) . in variants of the standard cdm model , these basic building blocks first formed at @xmath4@xmath5 .",
    "an important qualitative outcome of the microwave anisotropy data is the confirmation that the universe started out simple .",
    "it was by and large homogeneous and isotropic with small fluctuations that can be described by linear perturbation analysis .",
    "the current universe is clumpy and complicated .",
    "hence , the arrow of time in cosmic history also describes the progression from simplicity to complexity ( see figure  [ fig1a ] ) .",
    "while the conditions in the early universe can be summarized on a single sheet of paper , the mere description of the physical and biological structures found in the present - day universe can not be captured by thousands of books in our libraries .",
    "the formation of the first bound objects marks the central milestone in the transition from simplicity to complexity .",
    "pedagogically , it would seem only natural to attempt to understand this epoch before we try to explain the present - day universe .",
    "historically , however , most of the astronomical literature focused on the local universe and has only been shifting recently to the early universe .",
    "this violation of the pedagogical rule was forced upon us by the limited state of our technology ; observation of earlier cosmic times requires detection of distant sources , which is feasible only with large telescopes and highly - sensitive instrumentation .    for these reasons , advances in technology",
    "are likely to make the high redshift universe an important frontier of cosmology over the coming decade",
    ". this effort will involve large ( 30 meter ) ground - based telescopes and will culminate in the launch of the successor to the _ hubble space telescope _",

    "is ideally suited for probing optical - uv emission from sources at redshifts @xmath8 , just when popular cold dark matter models for structure formation predict the first baryonic objects to have collapsed .",
    "the study of the formation of the first generation of sources at early cosmic times ( high redshifts ) holds the key to constraining the power - spectrum of density fluctuations on small scales .",
    "previous research in cosmology has been dominated by studies of _ large scale structure _ ( lss ) ; future studies are likely to focus on _ small scale structure _ ( sss ) .",
    "the first sources are a direct consequence of the growth of linear density fluctuations . as such ,",
    "they emerge from a well - defined set of initial conditions and the physics of their formation can be followed precisely by computer simulation .",
    "the cosmic initial conditions for the formation of the first generation of stars are much simpler than those responsible for star formation in the galactic interstellar medium at present .",
    "the cosmic conditions are fully specified by the primordial power spectrum of gaussian density fluctuations , the mean density of dark matter , the initial temperature and density of the cosmic gas , and the primordial composition according to big - bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "the chemistry is much simpler in the absence of metals and the gas dynamics is much simpler in the absence of both dynamically - significant magnetic fields and feedback from luminous objects .",
    "the initial mass function of the first stars and black holes is therefore determined by a simple set of initial conditions ( although subsequent generations of stars are affected by feedback from photoionization heating and metal enrichment ) .",
    "while the early evolution of the seed density fluctuations can be fully described analytically , the collapse and fragmentation of nonlinear structure must be simulated numerically .",
    "the first baryonic objects connect the simple initial state of the universe to its complex current state , and their study with hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. , abel et al .  1998a , abel , bryan , & norman 2000 ; bromm , coppi , & larson 1999 ) and with future telescopes such as offers the key to advancing our knowledge on the formation physics of stars and massive black holes .",
    "the _ first light _ from stars and quasars ended the `` dark ages '' of the universe and initiated a `` renaissance of enlightenment '' in the otherwise fading glow of the microwave background ( see figure  [ fig1a ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see why the mere conversion of trace amounts of gas into stars or black holes at this early epoch could have had a dramatic effect on the ionization state and temperature of the rest of the gas in the universe .",
    "nuclear fusion releases @xmath9 ev per hydrogen atom , and thin - disk accretion onto a schwarzschild black hole releases ten times more energy ; however , the ionization of hydrogen requires only 13.6 ev .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to convert a small fraction , @xmath10 of the total baryonic mass into stars or black holes in order to ionize the rest of the universe .",
    "( the actual required fraction is higher by at least an order of magnitude [ bromm , kudritzky , & loeb 2000 ] because only some of the emitted photons are above the ionization threshold of 13.6 ev and because each hydrogen atom recombines more than once at redshifts @xmath11 ) .",
    "recent calculations of structure formation in popular cdm cosmologies imply that the universe was ionized at @xmath1212 ( haiman & loeb 1998 , 1999b , c ; gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; chiu & ostriker 2000 ; gnedin 2000a ) , and has remained ionized ever since .",
    "current observations are at the threshold of probing this epoch of reionization , given the fact that galaxies and quasars at redshifts @xmath13 are being discovered ( fan et al .",

    "the plot indicates that there is transmitted flux shortward of the ly@xmath15 wavelength at the quasar redshift .",

    "2000 ) implies @xmath25 or @xmath26 , i.e. , the low - density gas throughout the universe is fully ionized at @xmath14",
    "! one of the important challenges for future observations will be to identify _ when and how the intergalactic medium was ionized_. theoretical calculations ( see  [ sec6.3.1 ] ) imply that such observations are just around the corner .",
    "figure  [ fig1d ] shows schematically the various stages in a theoretical scenario for the history of hydrogen reionization in the intergalactic medium .",
    "the first gaseous clouds collapse at redshifts @xmath27@xmath5 and fragment into stars due to molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath28 ) cooling .",
    "however , h@xmath28 is fragile and can be easily dissociated by a small flux of uv radiation .",
    "hence the bulk of the radiation that ionized the universe is emitted from galaxies with a virial temperature @xmath29 k , where atomic cooling is effective and allows the gas to fragment ( see the end of  [ sec3.3 ] for an alternative scenario ) .",
    "since recent observations confine the standard set of cosmological parameters to a relatively narrow range , we assume a @xmath30cdm cosmology with a particular standard set of parameters in the quantitative results in this review .",
    "for the contributions to the energy density , we assume ratios relative to the critical density of @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , for matter , vacuum ( cosmological constant ) , and baryons , respectively . we also assume a hubble constant @xmath34 with @xmath35 , and a primordial scale invariant ( @xmath36 ) power spectrum with @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the root - mean - square amplitude of mass fluctuations in spheres of radius @xmath39 mpc .",

    "the modern physical description of the universe as a whole can be traced back to einstein , who argued theoretically for the so - called `` cosmological principle '' : that the distribution of matter and energy must be homogeneous and isotropic on the largest scales .",
    "today isotropy is well established ( see the review by wu , lahav , & rees 1999 ) for the distribution of faint radio sources , optically - selected galaxies , the x - ray background , and most importantly the cosmic microwave background ( henceforth , cmb ; see , e.g. , bennett et al.1996 ) .",
    "the constraints on homogeneity are less strict , but a cosmological model in which the universe is isotropic but significantly inhomogeneous in spherical shells around our special location is also excluded ( goodman 1995 ) .    in general relativity , the metric for a space which is spatially homogeneous and isotropic is the robertson - walker metric , which can be written in the form [ rw ] ds^2=dt^2-a^2(t )  , where @xmath41 is the cosmic scale factor which describes expansion in time , and @xmath42 are spherical comoving coordinates .",

    "observations of the cmb ( e.g. , bennett et al .",
    "1996 ) show that the universe at recombination was extremely uniform , but with spatial fluctuations in the energy density and gravitational potential of roughly one part in @xmath75 .",
    "such small fluctuations , generated in the early universe , grow over time due to gravitational instability , and eventually lead to the formation of galaxies and the large - scale structure observed in the present universe .    as in the previous section , we distinguish between fixed and comoving coordinates . using vector notation , the fixed coordinate @xmath76 corresponds to a comoving position @xmath77 . in a homogeneous universe with density @xmath51",

    "we impose small perturbations , given by a relative density perturbation ( ) = -1  , where the mean fluid density is @xmath81 , with a corresponding peculiar velocity @xmath82",

    "the potential @xmath83 is given by the poisson equation , in terms of the density perturbation : ^2=4 g | a^2  .",
    "this fluid description is valid for describing the evolution of collisionless cold dark matter particles until different particle streams cross .",
    "this `` shell - crossing '' typically occurs only after perturbations have grown to become non - linear , and at that point the individual particle trajectories must in general be followed .",
    "similarly , baryons can be described as a pressure - less fluid as long as their temperature is negligibly small , but non - linear collapse leads to the formation of shocks in the gas .    for small perturbations @xmath84",
    ", the fluid equations can be linearized and combined to yield + 2 h = 4 g |  .",
    "this linear equation has in general two independent solutions , only one of which grows with time . starting with random initial conditions , this `` growing mode '' comes to dominate the density evolution .",
    "thus , until it becomes non - linear , the density perturbation maintains its shape in comoving coordinates and grows in proportion to a growth factor @xmath85 .",
    "the growth factor is in general given by ( peebles 1980 ) d(t ) ^a  , where we neglect @xmath56 when considering halos forming at @xmath86 .",
    "in the einstein - de sitter model ( or , at high redshift , in other models as well ) the growth factor is simply proportional to @xmath41 .",
    "the spatial form of the initial density fluctuations can be described in fourier space , in terms of fourier components _ = d^3x ( ) e^-i  .here we use the comoving wavevector @xmath87 , whose magnitude @xmath43 is the comoving wavenumber which is equal to @xmath88 divided by the wavelength .",

    "inflation generates perturbations given by a gaussian random field , in which different @xmath87-modes are statistically independent , each with a random phase .",
    "the statistical properties of the fluctuations are determined by the variance of the different @xmath87-modes , and the variance is described in terms of the power spectrum @xmath89 as follows : = ( 2 ) ^3 p(k ) ^(3 ) ( -*k * )  , where @xmath90 is the three - dimensional dirac delta function .    in standard models",
    ", inflation produces a primordial power - law spectrum @xmath91 with @xmath92 .",
    "perturbation growth in the radiation - dominated and then matter - dominated universe results in a modified final power spectrum , characterized by a turnover at a scale of order the horizon @xmath93 at matter - radiation equality , and a small - scale asymptotic shape of @xmath94 . on large scales",
    "the power spectrum evolves in proportion to the square of the growth factor , and this simple evolution is termed linear evolution . on small scales ,",
    "the power spectrum changes shape due to the additional non - linear gravitational growth of perturbations , yielding the full , non - linear power spectrum .",
    "the overall amplitude of the power spectrum is not specified by current models of inflation , and it is usually set observationally using the cmb temperature fluctuations or local measures of large - scale structure .",
    "since density fluctuations may exist on all scales , in order to determine the formation of objects of a given size or mass it is useful to consider the statistical distribution of the smoothed density field . using a window function @xmath95 normalized so that @xmath96 , the smoothed density perturbation field , @xmath97 , itself follows a gaussian distribution with zero mean .",
    "for the particular choice of a spherical top - hat , in which @xmath98 in a sphere of radius @xmath99 and is zero outside , the smoothed perturbation field measures the fluctuations in the mass in spheres of radius @xmath99 .",
    "the normalization of the present power spectrum is often specified by the value of @xmath100 .",
    "for the top - hat , the smoothed perturbation field is denoted @xmath101 or @xmath102 , where the mass @xmath103 is related to the comoving radius @xmath99 by @xmath104 , in terms of the current mean density of matter @xmath105 .",

    "the dynamical collapse of a dark matter halo can be solved analytically only in cases of particular symmetry .",
    "if we consider a region which is much smaller than the horizon @xmath93 , then the formation of a halo can be formulated as a problem in newtonian gravity , in some cases with minor corrections coming from general relativity .",
    "the simplest case is that of spherical symmetry , with an initial ( @xmath110 ) top - hat of uniform overdensity @xmath111 inside a sphere of radius @xmath99 .",
    "although this model is restricted in its direct applicability , the results of spherical collapse have turned out to be surprisingly useful in understanding the properties and distribution of halos in models based on cold dark matter .",
    "the collapse of a spherical top - hat is described by the newtonian equation ( with a correction for the cosmological constant ) = h_0 ^ 2 r-  , where @xmath112 is the radius in a fixed ( not comoving ) coordinate frame , @xmath58 is the present hubble constant , @xmath103 is the total mass enclosed within radius @xmath112 , and the initial velocity field is given by the hubble flow @xmath113 .",
    "the enclosed @xmath109 grows initially as @xmath114 , in accordance with linear theory , but eventually @xmath109 grows above @xmath115 .",
    "if the mass shell at radius @xmath112 is bound ( i.e. , if its total newtonian energy is negative ) then it reaches a radius of maximum expansion and subsequently collapses .",
    "at the moment when the top - hat collapses to a point , the overdensity predicted by linear theory is ( peebles 1980 ) @xmath116 in the einstein - de sitter model , with only a weak dependence on @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",

    "in addition to characterizing the properties of individual halos , a critical prediction of any theory of structure formation is the abundance of halos , i.e. , the number density of halos as a function of mass , at any redshift .",
    "this prediction is an important step toward inferring the abundances of galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "while the number density of halos can be measured for particular cosmologies in numerical simulations , an analytic model helps us gain physical understanding and can be used to explore the dependence of abundances on all the cosmological parameters .",
    "a simple analytic model which successfully matches most of the numerical simulations was developed by press & schechter ( 1974 ) .",
    "the model is based on the ideas of a gaussian random field of density perturbations , linear gravitational growth , and spherical collapse . to determine the abundance of halos at a redshift @xmath69 , we use @xmath102 , the density field smoothed on a mass scale @xmath103 , as defined in  [ sec2.2 ] . although the model is based on the initial conditions , it is usually expressed in terms of redshift - zero quantities .",

    "such objects reach virial temperatures of several hundred degrees and can fragment into stars only through cooling by molecular hydrogen ( e.g. , abel 1995 ; tegmark et al .",
    "in other words , there are two independent minimum mass thresholds for star formation : the jeans mass ( related to accretion ) and the cooling mass . for the very first objects ,",
    "the cooling threshold is somewhat higher and sets a lower limit on the halo mass of @xmath291 at @xmath292 .",
    "however , molecular hydrogen ( @xmath293 ) is fragile and can easily be photo - dissociated by photons with energies of @xmath294@xmath295ev , to which the igm is transparent even before it is ionized .",
    "the photo - dissociation occurs through a two - step process , first suggested by solomon in 1965 ( compare field et al .  1966 ) and later analyzed quantitatively by stecher & williams ( 1967 ) .",

    "machacek , bryan & abel ( 2000 ) have confirmed that the soft uv background can delay the cooling and collapse of low - mass halos ( @xmath301 ) based on analytical arguments and three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations ; they also determined the halo mass threshold for collapse for a range of uv fluxes .",
    "omukai & nishi ( 1999 ; see also silk 1977 ) have argued that the photo - dissociation of h@xmath28 could be even more effective due to a small number of stars embedded within the gas clouds themselves .",
    "when considering the photo - dissociation of h@xmath28 before reionization , it is important to incorporate the _ processed _ spectrum of the uv background at photon energies below the lyman limit . due to the absorption at the lyman - series resonances this spectrum obtains the sawtooth shape shown in figure  [ fig3a ] . for any photon energy above ly@xmath15 at a particular redshift , there is a limited redshift interval beyond which no contribution from sources is possible because the corresponding photons are absorbed through one of the lyman - series resonances along the way .",
    "consider , for example , an energy of 11 ev at an observed redshift @xmath174 .",
    "photons received at this energy would have to be emitted at the 12.1 ev ly@xmath232 line from @xmath302 .",
    "thus , sources in the redshift interval 1011.1 could be seen at 11 ev , but radiation emitted by sources at @xmath303 ev would have passed through the 12.1 ev energy at some intermediate redshift , and would have been absorbed . thus , an observer viewing the universe at any photon energy above ly@xmath15 would see sources only out to some horizon , and the size of that horizon would depend on the photon energy . the number of contributing sources , and hence the total background flux at each photon energy , would depend on how far this energy is from the nearest lyman resonance .",
    "most of the photons absorbed along the way would be re - emitted at ly@xmath15 and then redshifted to lower energies .",
    "the result is a sawtooth spectrum for the uv background before reionization , with an enhancement below the ly@xmath15 energy ( see haiman et al .",
    "1997 for more details ) .",
    "unfortunately , the direct detection of the redshifted sawtooth spectrum as a remnant of the reionization epoch is not feasible due to the much higher flux contributed by foreground sources at later cosmic times .",
    "the radiative feedback on h@xmath28 need not be only negative , however .",
    "in the dense interiors of gas clouds , the formation rate of h@xmath28 could be accelerated through the production of free electrons by x - rays .",
    "this effect could counteract the destructive role of h@xmath28 photo - dissociation ( haiman , rees , & loeb 1996 ) .",
    "haiman , abel , & rees ( 2000 ) have shown that if a significant ( @xmath304 ) fraction of the early uv background is produced by massive black holes ( mini - quasars ) with hard spectra extending to photon energies @xmath305 , then the x - rays will catalyze h@xmath28 production and the net radiative feedback will be positive , allowing low mass objects to fragment into stars .",
    "these objects may greatly alter the topology of reionization (  [ sec6.3 ] ) .",

    "high - redshift objects could also , in principle , be detected through their cooling radiation .",

    "both forms of energy should come out on a time - scale of order the dynamical time .",

    "quasars are more effective than stars in ionizing the intergalactic hydrogen because ( i ) their emission spectrum is harder , ( ii ) the radiative efficiency of accretion flows can be more than an order of magnitude higher than the radiative efficiency of a star , and ( iii ) quasars are brighter , and for a given density distribution in their host system , the escape fraction of their ionizing photons is higher than for stars .    thus , the history of reionization may have been greatly altered by the existence of massive black holes in the low - mass galaxies that populate the universe at high redshifts .",
    "for this reason , it is important to understand the formation of massive black holes ( i.e. , black holes with a mass far greater than a stellar mass ) .",
    "the problem of black hole formation is not a priori more complicated than the problem of star formation .",
    "surprisingly , however , the amount of theoretical work on star formation far exceeds that on massive black hole formation .",
    "one of the reasons is that stars form routinely in our interstellar neighborhood where much data can be gathered , while black holes formed mainly in the distant past at great distances from our telescopes .",
    "as more information is gathered on the high - redshift universe , this state of affairs may begin to change .",
    "here we adopt the view that massive black holes form out of gas and not through the dynamical evolution of dense stellar systems ( see rees 1984 for a review of the alternatives ) . to form a black hole inside a given dark matter halo , the baryons must cool .",
    "for most objects , this is only possible with atomic line cooling at virial temperatures @xmath392k and thus baryonic masses @xmath393^{3/2}$ ] . after losing their thermal pressure , the cold baryons collapse and form a thin disk on a dynamical time ( loeb & rasio 1994 ) .",
    "the basic question is then the following : what fraction of the cold baryons is able to sink to the very center of the potential well and form a massive black hole ? just as for star formation ,",
    "the main barrier in this process is angular momentum .",
    "the centrifugal force opposes radial infall and keeps the gas in disks at a typical distance which is 68 orders of magnitude larger than the schwarzschild radius corresponding to the total gas mass .",
    "eisenstein & loeb ( 1995b ) demonstrated that a small fraction of all objects have a sufficiently low angular momentum that the gas in them inevitably forms a compact semi - relativistic disk that evolves to a black hole on a short viscous time - scale .",
    "these low - spin systems are born in special cosmological environments that exert unusually small tidal torques on them during their cosmological collapse . as long as the initial cooling time of the gas is short and its star formation efficiency is low , the gas forms the compact disk on a free - fall time . in most systems",
    "the baryons dominate gravity inside the scale length of the disk . therefore ,",
    "if the baryons in a low - spin system acquire a spin parameter which is only one sixth of the typical value , i.e. , an initial rotation speed @xmath394 , then with angular momentum conservation they would reach rotational support at a radius @xmath395 and circular velocity @xmath396 such that @xmath397 , where @xmath398 is the virial radius and @xmath399 the circular velocity of the halo . using the relations : @xmath400 , and",
    "@xmath401\\sim v_{\\rm disk}^2 $ ] , we get @xmath402 . for @xmath403k , the dark matter halo has a potential depth corresponding to a circular velocity of @xmath404 , and the low - spin disk attains a characteristic rotation velocity of @xmath405 ( sufficient to retain the gas against supernova - driven winds ) , a size @xmath406 pc , and a viscous evolution time which is extremely short compared to the hubble time .",
    "low - spin dwarf galaxies populate the universe with a significant volume density at high redshift ; these systems are eventually incorporated into higher mass galaxies which form later .",
    "for example , a galactic bulge of @xmath407 in baryons forms out of @xmath408 building blocks of @xmath409 each . in order to seed the growth of a quasar , it is sufficient that only one of these systems had formed a low - spin disk that produced a black hole progenitor .",
    "note that if a low - spin object is embedded in an overdense region that eventually becomes a galactic bulge , then the black hole progenitor will sink to the center of the bulge by dynamical friction in less than a hubble time ( for a sufficiently high mass @xmath410 ; p.  428 of binney & tremaine ) and seed quasar activity .",
    "based on the phase - space volume accessible to low - spin systems ( @xmath411 ) , we expect a fraction @xmath412 of all the collapsed gas mass in the universe to be associated with low - spin disks ( eisenstein & loeb 1995b ) . however , this is a conservative estimate .",
    "additional angular momentum loss due to dynamical friction of gaseous clumps in dark matter halos ( navarro , frenk , & white 1995 ) or bar instabilities in self - gravitating disks ( shlosman , begelman , & frank 1990 ) could only contribute to the black hole formation process .",
    "the popular paradigm that all galaxies harbor black holes at their center simply _ postulates _ that in all massive systems , a small fraction of the gas ends up as a black hole , but does not explain quantitatively why this fraction obtains its particular small value .",
    "the above scenario offers a possible physical context for this result .",
    "if the viscous evolution time is shorter than the cooling time and if the gas entropy is raised by viscous dissipation or shocks to a sufficiently high value , then the black hole formation process will go through the phase of a supermassive star ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ,  17 ; see also zeldovich & novikov 1971 ) .",
    "the existence of angular momentum ( wagoner 1969 ) tends to stabilize the collapse against the instability which itself is due to general - relativistic corrections to the newtonian potential ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ,  17.4 ) .",
    "however , shedding of mass and angular momentum along the equatorial plane eventually leads to collapse ( bisnovati - kogan , zeldovich & novikov 1967 ; loeb & rasio 1994 ; baumgarte & shapiro 1999a ) .",
    "since it is convectively unstable ( loeb & rasio 1994 ) and supported by radiation pressure , a supermassive star should radiate close to the eddington limit ( with modifications due to rotation ; see baumgarte & shapiro 1999b ) and generate a strong wind , especially if the gas is enriched with metals .",
    "the thermal@xmath413wind emission associated with the collapse of a supermassive star should be short - lived and could account for only a minority of all observed quasars .",
    "after the seed black hole forms , it is continually fed with gas during mergers .",
    "mihos & hernquist ( 1996 ) have demonstrated that mergers tend to deposit large quantities of gas at the centers of the merging galaxies , a process which could fuel a starburst or a quasar .",
    "if both of the merging galaxies contain black holes at their centers , dynamical friction will bring the black holes together .",
    "the final spiral - in of the black hole binary depends on the injection of new stars into orbits which allow them to extract angular momentum from the binary ( begelman , blandford , & rees 1980 ) . if the orbital radius of the binary shrinks to a sufficiently small value , gravitational radiation takes over and leads to coalescence of the two black holes .",
    "this will provide powerful sources for future gravitational wave detectors ( such as the lisa project ; see http://lisa.jpl.nasa.gov ) .",
    "the fact that black holes are found in low - mass galaxies in the local universe implies that they are likely to exist also at high redshift .",

    "however , some numerical simulations suggest that feedback may not adequately suppress the angular momentum losses ( navarro & steinmetz 2000 ) .    with the assumption that @xmath424 , the distribution of disk sizes is then determined by the press - schechter halo abundance and by the distribution of spin parameters [ along with equation  ( [ rvir ] ) for @xmath398 ] .",
    "the spin parameter distribution is approximately independent of mass , environment , and cosmological parameters , apparently a consequence of the scale - free properties of the early tidal torques between neighboring systems responsible for the spin of individual halos ( peebles 1969 ; white 1984 ; barnes & efstathiou 1987 ; heavens & peacock 1988 ; steinmetz & bartelmann 1995 ; eisenstein & loeb 1995a ; cole & lacey 1996 ; catelan & theuns 1996 ) .",

    "if a dense bulge exists , it can prevent bar instabilities , or if a bar forms it may be weakened or destroyed when a bulge subsequently forms ( sellwood & moore 1999 ) .",
    "schmidt ( 1959 ) put forth the hypothesis that the rate of star formation in a given region varies as a power of the gas density within that region .",

    "although schmidt originally focused on different regions within our own galaxy , this relation has since been used to interpret observations of the global star formation rates in different galaxies .",
    "one particular value of @xmath431 is theoretically favored for self - gravitating disks ( e.g. , larson 1992 ; elmegreen 1994 ) .",
    "the star formation rate can be written in the form =  , where @xmath432 is an efficiency coefficient , and @xmath433 is a characteristic time for star formation .",

    "however , observations yield estimates of surface densities @xmath436 , not volume densities @xmath51 .",
    "if the average gas scale height is roughly constant in different environments , then the same relation as equation  ( [ schmidt ] ) should hold between the surface densities of stars and gas , with @xmath435 .",
    "such a relation has , indeed , been observed to hold over a large range of physical conditions in galaxies .",
    "synthetic models which include stellar evolution tracks and stellar atmosphere models are used to infer star formation rates using spectral observations of stellar populations .",
    "star formation rates have been inferred in this way in the disks of normal spiral and irregular galaxies , most often using h@xmath437 luminosities .",
    "star formation also occurs in much denser environments in the nuclear regions of galaxies , where far - infrared luminosities are most useful for determining star formation rates .",

    "the intergalactic ionizing radiation field , a key ingredient in the development of reionization , is determined by the amount of ionizing radiation escaping from the host galaxies of stars and quasars .",
    "the value of the escape fraction as a function of redshift and galaxy mass remains a major uncertainty in all current studies , and could affect the cumulative radiation intensity by orders of magnitude at any given redshift .",
    "gas within halos is far denser than the typical density of the igm , and in general each halo is itself embedded within an overdense region , so the transfer of the ionizing radiation must be followed in the densest regions in the universe .",
    "numerical simulations of reionization are limited in their resolution of the densest regions and in the accuracy of their treatment of radiative transfer .",
    "the escape of ionizing radiation ( @xmath440ev , @xmath441  ) from the disks of present - day galaxies has been studied in recent years in the context of explaining the extensive diffuse ionized gas layers observed above the disk in the milky way ( reynolds et al .",
    "1995 ) and other galaxies ( e.g. , rand 1996 ; hoopes , walterbos , & rand 1999 ) .",

    "if similar escape fractions characterize high - redshift galaxies , then stars could have provided a major fraction of the background radiation that reionized the igm ( e.g. , madau & shull 1996 ; madau 1999 ) .",
    "however , the escape fraction from high - redshift galaxies , which formed when the universe was much denser ( @xmath444 ) , may be significantly lower than that predicted by models meant to describe present - day galaxies .",
    "current reionization calculations assume that galaxies are isotropic point sources of ionizing radiation and adopt escape fractions in the range @xmath445 ( see , e.g. , gnedin 2000a , miralda - escud et al .",

    "clumping is known to have a significant effect on the penetration and escape of radiation from an inhomogeneous medium ( e.g. , boiss 1990 ; witt & gordon 1996 , 2000 ; neufeld 1991 ; haiman & spaans 1999 ; bianchi et al .",
    "the inclusion of clumpiness introduces several unknown parameters into the calculation , such as the number and overdensity of the clumps , and the spatial correlation between the clumps and the ionizing sources .",
    "an additional complication may arise from hydrodynamic feedback , whereby part of the gas mass is expelled from the disk by stellar winds and supernovae (  [ sec7 ] ) .",
    "wood & loeb ( 2000 ) used a three - dimensional radiation transfer code to calculate the steady - state escape fraction of ionizing photons from disk galaxies as a function of redshift and galaxy mass .",
    "the gaseous disks were assumed to be isothermal , with a sound speed @xmath446 , and radially exponential , with a scale - length based on the characteristic spin parameter and virial radius of their host halos .",
    "the corresponding temperature of @xmath342 k is typical for a gas which is continuously heated by photo - ionization from stars .",
    "the sources of radiation were taken to be either stars embedded in the disk , or a central quasar . for stellar sources ,",
    "the predicted increase in the disk density with redshift resulted in a strong decline of the escape fraction with increasing redshift .",
    "the situation is different for a central quasar . due to its higher luminosity and central location",
    ", the quasar tends to produce an ionization channel in the surrounding disk through which much of its ionizing radiation escapes from the host . in a steady state , only recombinations in this ionization channel must be balanced by ionizations , while for stars there are many ionization channels produced by individual star - forming regions and the total recombination rate in these channels is very high .",
    "escape fractions @xmath304 were achieved for stars at @xmath447 only if @xmath448 of the gas was expelled from the disks or if dense clumps removed the gas from the vast majority ( @xmath449 ) of the disk volume ( see figure  [ fig6a ] ) .",
    "this analysis applies only to halos with virial temperatures @xmath29 k. ricotti & shull ( 2000 ) reached similar conclusions but for a quasi - spherical configuration of stars and gas .",
    "they demonstrated that the escape fraction is substantially higher in low - mass halos with a virial temperature @xmath450 k. however , the formation of stars in such halos depends on their uncertain ability to cool via the efficient production of molecular hydrogen ( see  [ sec3.3 ] ) .",
    "the main uncertainty in the above predictions involves the distribution of the gas inside the host galaxy , as the gas is exposed to the radiation released by stars and the mechanical energy deposited by supernovae .",
    "given the fundamental role played by the escape fraction , it is desirable to calibrate its value observationally .",
    "recently , steidel , pettini , & adelberger ( 2001 ) reported a preliminary detection of significant lyman continuum flux in the composite spectrum of 29 lyman break galaxies ( lbg ) with redshifts in the range @xmath451 .",
    "they co - added the spectra of these galaxies in order to be able to measure the low flux .",
    "another difficulty in the measurement comes from the need to separate the lyman - limit break caused by the interstellar medium from that already produced in the stellar atmospheres . after correcting for intergalactic absorption , steidel et al .",
    "( 2001 ) inferred a ratio between the emergent flux density at 1500   and 900   ( rest frame ) of @xmath452 .",
    "taking into account the fact that the stellar spectrum should already have an intrinsic lyman discontinuity of a factor of @xmath4535 , but that only @xmath454@xmath455 of the 1500   photons escape from typical lbgs without being absorbed by dust ( pettini et al .",
    "1998a ; adelberger & steidel 2000 ) , the inferred 900   escape fraction is @xmath456@xmath455 .",
    "however , the observed blue spectrum suggests that these 29 particular lbgs may have a very low dust content , and the escape fraction in these galaxies may be @xmath457 or higher ( haehnelt 2001 ) .",
    "thus , although the galaxies in this sample were drawn from the bluest quartile of the lbg spectral energy distributions , the measurement implies that this quartile may itself dominate the hydrogen - ionizing background relative to quasars at @xmath458 .",
    "the radiation output from the first stars ionizes hydrogen in a growing volume , eventually encompassing almost the entire igm within a single bubble . in the early stages of this process ,",
    "each galaxy produces a distinct region , and only when the overall filling factor becomes significant do neighboring bubbles begin to overlap in large numbers , ushering in the `` overlap phase '' of reionization .",
    "thus , the first goal of a model of reionization is to describe the initial stage , when each source produces an isolated expanding region .",
    "we assume a spherical ionized volume @xmath459 , separated from the surrounding neutral gas by a sharp ionization front . in the case of a stellar ionizing spectrum ,",
    "most ionizing photons are just above the hydrogen ionization threshold of 13.6 ev , where the absorption cross - section is high and a very thin layer of neutral hydrogen is sufficient to absorb all the ionizing photons . on the other hand , an ionizing source such as",
    "a quasar produces significant numbers of higher energy photons and results in a thicker transition region .    in the absence of recombinations , each hydrogen atom in the igm would only have to be ionized once , and the ionized proper volume @xmath460 would simply be determined by _",

    "we summarize recent progress , both analytic and numerical , made toward elucidating the basic physics of reionization and the way in which the characteristics of reionization depend on the nature of the ionizing sources and on other input parameters of cosmological models .",
    "the process of the reionization of hydrogen involves several distinct stages .",
    "the initial , `` pre - overlap '' stage ( using the terminology of gnedin 2000a ) consists of individual ionizing sources turning on and ionizing their surroundings .",
    "the first galaxies form in the most massive halos at high redshift , and these halos are biased and are preferentially located in the highest - density regions .",
    "thus the ionizing photons which escape from the galaxy itself ( see  [ sec6.1 ] ) must then make their way through the surrounding high - density regions , which are characterized by a high recombination rate .",
    "once they emerge , the ionization fronts propagate more easily into the low - density voids , leaving behind pockets of neutral , high - density gas . during this period",
    "the igm is a two - phase medium characterized by highly ionized regions separated from neutral regions by ionization fronts .",
    "furthermore , the ionizing intensity is very inhomogeneous even within the ionized regions , with the intensity determined by the distance from the nearest source and by the ionizing luminosity of this source .",
    "the central , relatively rapid `` overlap '' phase of reionization begins when neighboring regions begin to overlap .",
    "whenever two ionized bubbles are joined , each point inside their common boundary becomes exposed to ionizing photons from both sources .",
    "therefore , the ionizing intensity inside regions rises rapidly , allowing those regions to expand into high - density gas which had previously recombined fast enough to remain neutral when the ionizing intensity had been low . since each bubble coalescence accelerates the process of reionization , the overlap phase has the character of a phase transition and",
    "is expected to occur rapidly , over less than a hubble time at the overlap redshift . by the end of this stage most regions in the igm",
    "are able to see several unobscured sources , and therefore the ionizing intensity is much higher than before overlap and it is also much more homogeneous .",
    "an additional ingredient in the rapid overlap phase results from the fact that hierarchical structure formation models predict a galaxy formation rate that rises rapidly with time at the relevant redshift range .",
    "this process leads to a state in which the low - density igm has been highly ionized and ionizing radiation reaches everywhere except for gas located inside self - shielded , high - density clouds .",
    "this marks the end of the overlap phase , and this important landmark is most often referred to as the moment of reionization.    some neutral gas does , however , remain in high - density structures which correspond to lyman limit systems and damped ly@xmath15 systems seen in absorption at lower redshifts .",
    "the high - density regions are gradually ionized as galaxy formation proceeds , and the mean ionizing intensity also grows with time .",
    "the ionizing intensity continues to grow and to become more uniform as an increasing number of ionizing sources is visible to every point in the igm .",
    "this `` post - overlap '' phase continues indefinitely , since collapsed objects retain neutral gas even in the present universe .",
    "the igm does , however , reach another milestone ( of limited significance ) at @xmath496 , the breakthrough redshift ( which is determined by the probability of intersecting lyman limit systems ; madau , haardt , & rees 1999 ) .",
    "below this redshift , all ionizing sources are visible to each other , while above this redshift absorption by the ly@xmath15 forest clouds implies that only sources in a small redshift range are visible to a typical point in the igm .",
    "semi - analytic models of the pre - overlap stage focus on the evolution of the filling factor , i.e. , the fraction of the volume of the universe which is filled by regions .",
    "we distinguish between the naive filling factor @xmath497 and the actual filling factor or porosity @xmath498 .",
    "the naive filling factor equals the number density of bubbles times the average volume of each , and it may exceed unity since when bubbles begin to overlap the overlapping volume is counted multiple times .",
    "however , as explained below , in the case of reionization the linearity of the physics means that @xmath497 is a very good approximation to @xmath498 up to the end of the overlap phase of reionization .",
    "the model of individual regions presented in the previous section can be used to understand the development of the total filling factor . starting with equation  ( [ hiireg ] ) ,",
    "if we assume a common clumping factor @xmath467 for all regions then we can sum each term of the equation over all bubbles in a given large volume of the universe , and then divide by this volume .",
    "then @xmath459 is replaced by the filling factor and @xmath462 by the total number of ionizing photons produced up to some time @xmath46 , per unit volume .",
    "the latter quantity equals the mean number of ionizing photons per baryon times the mean density of baryons @xmath499 . following the arguments leading to equation  ( [ rmax ] )",
    ", we find that if we include only stars then = f_col  , [ ngnb ] where the collapse fraction @xmath500 is the fraction of all the baryons in the universe which are in galaxies , i.e. , the fraction of gas which settles into halos and cools efficiently inside them . in writing equation  ( [ ngnb ] )",
    "we are assuming instantaneous production of photons , i.e. , that the time - scale for the formation and evolution of the massive stars in a galaxy is short compared to the hubble time at the formation redshift of the galaxy . in a model based on equation  ( [ hiireg ] ) , the near - equality between @xmath497 and @xmath498 results from the linearity of this equation .",
    "first , the total number of ionizations equals the total number of ionizing photons produced by stars , i.e. , all ionizing photons contribute regardless of the spatial distribution of sources ; and second , the total recombination rate is proportional to the total ionized volume , regardless of its topology .",
    "thus , even if two or more bubbles overlap the model remains an accurate approximation for @xmath498 ( at least until @xmath498 becomes nearly equal to 1 ) .",
    "note , however , that there still are a number of important simplifications in the model , including the assumption of a homogeneous ( though possibly time - dependent ) clumping factor , and the neglect of feedback whereby the formation of one galaxy may suppress further galaxy formation in neighboring regions .",
    "these complications are discussed in detail below and in  [ sec6.5 ] and  [ sec7 ] .    under these assumptions we convert equation  ( [ hiireg ] ) , which describes individual regions , to an equation which statistically describes the transition from a neutral universe to a fully ionized one ( compare madau et al .  1999 and haiman & loeb 1997 ) : = - _ b _",

    "a simple estimate of the collapse fraction at high redshift is the mass fraction ( given by equation  ( [ pserfc ] ) in the press - schechter model ) in halos above the cooling threshold , which is the minimum mass of halos in which gas can cool efficiently . assuming that only atomic cooling is effective during the redshift range of reionization (  [ sec3.3 ] ) ,",

    "note that if @xmath505 then recombinations are unimportant , but if @xmath506 then recombinations significantly delay the reionization redshift ( for a fixed star - formation history ) .",

    "this has been shown by a number of theoretical , semi - analytic calculations ( fukugita & kawasaki 1994 ; shapiro , giroux , & babul 1994 ; kamionkowski , spergel , & sugiyama 1994 ; tegmark , silk , & blanchard 1994 ; haiman & loeb 1997 ; valageas & silk 1999 ; chiu & ostriker 2000 ; ciardi et al .",

    "note that the prescription whereby a constant fraction of the galactic mass accretes onto a central black hole is based on local observations ( see  [ sec8.2.2 ] ) which indicate that @xmath193 galaxies harbor central black holes of mass equal to @xmath509@xmath510 of their bulge mass .",
    "although the bulge constitutes only a fraction of the total baryonic mass of each galaxy , the higher gas - to - stellar mass ratio in high - redshift galaxies , as well as their high merger rates compared to their low - redshift counterparts , suggest that a fraction of a percent of the total gas mass in high - redshift galaxies may have contributed to the formation of quasar black holes .",
    "although many models yield a reionization redshift around 712 , the exact value depends on a number of uncertain parameters affecting both the source term and the recombination term in equation  ( [ qiieqn ] ) .",

    "the resulting mean clumping factor depends on the density and clustering of sources , and on the distribution and topology of density fluctuations in the igm .",
    "furthermore , the source halos should tend to form in overdense regions , and the clumping factor is affected by this cross - correlation between the sources and the igm density .",
    "valageas & silk ( 1999 ) and chiu & ostriker ( 2000 ) calculated the clumping factor semi - analytically by averaging over the igm on the one hand and virialized halos on the other hand , with the average weighed according to the gas fraction in halos .",
    "the semi - analytic methods used in these two detailed calculations of reionization have different advantages : valageas & silk ( 1999 ) included a model for clumping and absorption by ly@xmath15 clouds , but chiu & ostriker ( 2000 ) used a generally more realistic two - phase model with separate ionized and neutral regions .",
    "miralda - escud , haehnelt , & rees ( 2000 ) went further in their modeling of the clumping factor by attempting to account for the geometry of ionized regions .",
    "they presented a simple model for the distribution of density fluctuations , and more generally they discussed the implications of inhomogeneous clumping during reionization .",
    "they noted that as ionized regions grow , they more easily extend into low - density regions , and they tend to leave behind high - density concentrations , with these neutral islands being ionized only at a later time .",
    "they therefore argued that , since at high - redshift the collapse fraction is low , most of the high - density regions , which would dominate the clumping factor if they were ionized , will in fact remain neutral and occupy only a tiny fraction of the total volume .",
    "thus , the development of reionization through the end of the overlap phase should occur almost exclusively in the low - density igm , and the effective clumping factor during this time should be @xmath511 , making recombinations relatively unimportant ( see figure  [ fig6c ] ) . only in the post - reionization phase , miralda - escud et al .",
    "( 2000 ) argued , do the high density clouds and filaments become gradually ionized as the mean ionizing intensity further increases .",
    "the complexity of the process of reionization is illustrated by the recent numerical simulation by gnedin ( 2000a ) of stellar reionization ( in @xmath30cdm with @xmath31 ) .",
    "this simulation uses a formulation of radiative transfer which relies on several rough approximations ; although it does not include the effect of shadowing behind optically - thick clumps , it does include for each point in the igm the effects of an estimated local optical depth around that point , plus a local optical depth around each ionizing source .",
    "this simulation helps to understand the advantages of the various theoretical approaches , while pointing to the complications which are not included in the simple models .",
    "figures  [ fig6d ] and [ fig6e ] , taken from figure  3 in gnedin ( 2000a ) , show the state of the simulated universe just before and just after the overlap phase , respectively .",
    "they show a thin ( 15 @xmath512 comoving kpc ) slice through the box , which is 4 @xmath512 mpc on a side .",
    "the simulation achieves a spatial resolution of @xmath513 kpc , and uses @xmath514 each of dark matter particles and baryonic particles ( with each baryonic particle having a mass of @xmath515 ) .",
    "the figures show the redshift evolution of the ionizing intensity averaged over the entire volume , @xmath516 ( upper right panel ) , and , visually , the spatial distribution of three quantities : the neutral hydrogen fraction ( upper left panel ) , the gas density ( lower left panel ) , and the gas temperature ( lower right panel ) . note the obvious features around the edges , resulting from the periodic boundary conditions assumed in the simulation ( e.g. , the left and right edges match identically ) . also note that the intensity @xmath516 is defined as the radiation intensity at the lyman limit , expressed in units of @xmath517 . for a given source emission , the intensity inside regions depends on absorption and radiative transfer through the igm ( e.g. , haardt & madau 1996 ; abel & haehnelt 1999 )    figure  [ fig6d ] shows the two - phase igm at @xmath518 , with ionized bubbles emanating from many independent sources , although there is one main concentration ( located at the right edge of the image , vertically near the center ; note the periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "the bubbles are shown expanding into low density regions and beginning to overlap at the center of the image .",
    "the topology of ionized regions is clearly complex : while the ionized regions are analogous to islands in an ocean of neutral hydrogen , the islands themselves contain small lakes of dense neutral gas .",
    "one aspect which has not been included in theoretical models of clumping is clear from the figure .",
    "the sources themselves are located in the highest density regions ( these being the sites where the earliest galaxies form ) and must therefore ionize the gas in their immediate vicinity before the radiation can escape into the low density igm .",
    "for this reason , the effective clumping factor is of order 100 in the simulation and also , by the overlap redshift , roughly ten ionizing photons have been produced per baryon .",
    "as emphasized by gnedin ( 2000a ) , some of these numbers are resolution dependent , since the clumping factor accounts only for absorption by gas at the highest resolvable density .",
    "a higher - resolution simulation would have higher - density gas clumps and  depending on the geometry of those clumps  a higher or possibly lower clumping factor than the low - resolution simulation .",
    "figure  [ fig6e ] shows that by @xmath519 the low density regions have all become highly ionized along with a rapid increase in the ionizing intensity .",
    "the only neutral islands left are the highest density regions which are not near the sources ( compare the two panels on the left ) .",
    "however , we emphasize that the quantitative results of this simulation must be considered preliminary , since the effects of increased resolution and a more accurate treatment of radiative transfer are yet to be explored .",
    "methods are being developed for incorporating a more complete treatment of radiative transfer into three dimensional cosmological simulations ( e.g. , abel , norman , & madau 1999 ; razoumov & scott 1999 ) .",
    "gnedin , ferrara , & zweibel ( 2000 ) investigated an additional effect of reionization .",
    "they showed that the biermann battery in cosmological ionization fronts inevitably generates coherent magnetic fields of an amplitude @xmath520 gauss .",
    "these fields form as a result of the breakout of the ionization fronts from galaxies and their propagation through the filaments in the igm .",
    "although the fields are too small to directly affect galaxy formation , they could be the seeds for the magnetic fields observed in galaxies and x - ray clusters today .",
    "if quasars contribute substantially to the ionizing intensity during reionization then several aspects of reionization are modified compared to the case of pure stellar reionization .",
    "first , the ionizing radiation emanates from a single , bright point - source inside each host galaxy , and can establish an escape route ( funnel ) more easily than in the case of stars which are smoothly distributed throughout the galaxy (  [ sec6.1 ] ) .",
    "second , the hard photons produced by a quasar penetrate deeper into the surrounding neutral gas , yielding a thicker ionization front . finally , the quasar x - rays catalyze the formation of h@xmath28 molecules and allow stars to keep forming in very small halos (  [ sec3.3 ] ) .",
    "oh ( 2000 ) showed that star - forming regions may also produce significant x - rays at high redshift .",
    "the emission is due to inverse compton scattering of cmb photons off relativistic electrons in the ejecta , as well as thermal emission by the hot supernova remnant .",
    "the spectrum expected from this process is even harder than for typical quasars , and the hard photons photoionize the igm efficiently by repeated secondary ionizations .",
    "the radiation , characterized by roughly equal energy per logarithmic frequency interval , would produce a uniform ionizing intensity and lead to gradual ionization and heating of the entire igm .",
    "thus , if this source of emission is indeed effective at high redshift , it may have a crucial impact in changing the topology of reionization . even if stars dominate the emission , the hardness of the ionizing spectrum depends on the initial mass function . at high redshift",
    "it may be biased toward massive , efficiently ionizing stars ( see  [ sec4.1.1 ] ) , but this remains very much uncertain .",
    "semi - analytic as well as numerical models of reionization depend on an extrapolation of hierarchical models to higher redshifts and lower - mass halos than the regime where the models have been compared to observations .",
    "these models have the advantage that they are based on the current cdm paradigm which is supported by a variety of observations of large - scale structure , galaxy clustering , and the cmb .",
    "the disadvantage is that the properties of high - redshift galaxies are derived from those of their host halos by prescriptions which are based on low - redshift observations , and these prescriptions will only be tested once abundant data is available on galaxies which formed during the reionization era .",
    "an alternative approach to analyzing the possible ionizing sources which brought about reionization is to extrapolate from the observed populations of galaxies and quasars at currently accessible redshifts .",
    "this has been attempted , e.g. , by madau et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and miralda - escud et al .",
    "the general conclusion is that a high - redshift source population similar to the one observed at @xmath5214 would produce roughly the needed ionizing intensity for reionization .",
    "a precise conclusion , however , remains elusive because of the same kinds of uncertainties as those found in the models based on cdm : the typical escape fraction , and the faint end of the luminosity function , are both not well determined even at @xmath5214 , and in addition the clumping factor at high redshift must be known in order to determine the importance of recombinations .",
    "future direct observations of the source population at redshifts approaching reionization may help resolve some of these questions .",
    "the sources that reionized hydrogen very likely caused the single reionization of helium from to .",
    "neutral helium is ionized by photons of 24.6 ev or higher energy , and its recombination rate is roughly equal to that of hydrogen . on the other hand ,",
    "the ionization threshold of is 54.4 ev , and fully ionized helium recombines @xmath522 times faster than hydrogen .",
    "this means that for both quasars and galaxies , the reionization of should occur later than the reionization of hydrogen , even though the number of helium atoms is smaller than hydrogen by a factor of 13 .",
    "the lower redshift of reionization makes it more accessible to observations and allows it to serve in some ways as an observational preview of hydrogen reionization .",

    "heap et al .",
    "measure an average @xmath537 in this region , and note that the significant correlation of the observed spectrum with the simulated one suggests that much of the absorption is due to a ly@xmath15 forest while the low - density igm provides a relatively low opacity in this region .",
    "the authors conclude that the observed data suggest a sharp opacity break occurring between @xmath538 and 2.9 , accompanied by a hardening of the uv ionizing background .",
    "however , even the relatively high opacity at @xmath539 only requires @xmath540 of helium atoms not to be fully ionized , in a region at the mean baryon density .",
    "thus , the overlap phase of full helium reionization may have occurred significantly earlier , with the ionizing intensity already fairly uniform but still increasing with time at @xmath541 .",
    "the properties of helium reionization have been investigated numerically by a number of authors .",
    "zheng & davidsen ( 1995 ) modeled the proximity effect , and a number of authors ( miralda - escud et al .",
    "1996 ; croft et al .  1997 ;",
    "zhang et al .   1998 ) used numerical simulations to show that the observations generally agree with cold dark matter models .",
    "they also found that helium absorption particularly tests the properties of under - dense voids which produce much of the opacity but little opacity in . according to the semi - analytic model of inhomogeneous reionization of miralda - escud , haehnelt , & rees ( 2000 ; see also  [ sec6.3.1 ] ) , the total emissivity of observed quasars at redshift 3 suffices to completely reionize helium before @xmath521 .",
    "they find that the observations at @xmath458 can be reproduced if a population of low - luminosity sources , perhaps galaxies , has ionized the low - density igm up to an overdensity of around 12 relative to the cosmological mean , with luminous quasars creating the observed gaps of transmitted flux .",
    "the conclusion that an evolution of the ionization state of helium has been observed is also strengthened by several indirect lines of evidence .",
    "songaila & cowie ( 1996 ) and songaila ( 1998 ) found a rapid increase in the / ratio with decreasing redshift at @xmath521 , for intermediate column density hydrogen ly@xmath15 absorption lines .",
    "they interpreted this evolution as a sudden hardening below @xmath521 of the spectrum of the ionizing background .",
    "boksenberg et al .",
    "( 1998 ) also found an increase in the / ratio , but their data implied a much more gradual increase from @xmath542 to @xmath543 .",
    "the full reionization of helium due to a hard ionizing spectrum should also heat the igm to 20,000 k or higher , while the igm can only reach @xmath54410,000 k during a reionization of hydrogen alone ( although a temperature of @xmath54415,000 k may be reached due to compton heating by the hard x - ray background : madau & efstathiou 1999 ) .",
    "this increase in temperature can serve as an observational probe of helium reionization , and it should also increase the suppression of dwarf galaxy formation (  [ sec6.5 ] ) .",
    "the temperature of the igm can be measured by searching for the smallest line - widths among hydrogen ly@xmath15 absorption lines ( schaye et al .",
    "in general , bulk velocity gradients contribute to the line width on top of thermal velocities , but a lower bound on the width is set by thermal broadening , and the narrowest lines can be used to measure the temperature . several different measurements ( ricotti et al .",

    "2000 ) have found a nearly isothermal igm at a temperature of @xmath54420,000 k at @xmath521 , higher than expected in ionization equilibrium and suggestive of photo - heating due to ongoing reionization of helium .",
    "however , the measurement errors remain too large for a firm conclusion about the redshift evolution of the igm temperature or its equation of state .    clearly , the reionization of helium is already a rich phenomenological subject",
    ". our knowledge will benefit from measurements of increasing accuracy , made toward many more lines of sight , and extended to higher redshift .",
    "new ways to probe helium will also be useful .",
    "for example , miralda - escud ( 2000 ) has suggested that continuum absorption in soft x - rays can be used to determine the fraction along the line of sight , although the measurement requires an accurate subtraction of the galactic contribution to the absorption , based on the galactic column density as determined by 21 cm maps .",
    "the end of the reionization phase transition resulted in the emergence of an intense uv background that filled the universe and heated the igm to temperatures of @xmath511@xmath545k ( see the previous section ) .",
    "after ionizing the rarefied igm in the voids and filaments on large scales , the cosmic uv background penetrated the denser regions associated with the virialized gaseous halos of the first generation of objects .",
    "a major fraction of the collapsed gas had been incorporated by that time into halos with a virial temperature @xmath546k , where the lack of atomic cooling prevented the formation of galactic disks and stars or quasars .",
    "photoionization heating by the cosmic uv background could then evaporate much of this gas back into the igm .",
    "the photo - evaporating halos , as well as those halos which did retain their gas , may have had a number of important consequences just after reionization as well as at lower redshifts .    in this section",
    "we focus on the process by which gas that had already settled into virialized halos by the time of reionization was evaporated back into the igm due to the cosmic uv background .",
    "this process was investigated by barkana & loeb ( 1999 ) using semi - analytic methods and idealized numerical calculations .",
    "they first considered an isolated spherical , centrally - concentrated dark matter halo containing gas .",
    "since most of the photo - evaporation occurs at the end of overlap , when the ionizing intensity builds up almost instantaneously , a sudden illumination by an external ionizing background may be assumed .",
    "self - shielding of the gas implies that the halo interior sees a reduced intensity and a harder spectrum , since the outer gas layers preferentially block photons with energies just above the lyman limit .",
    "it is useful to parameterize the external radiation field by a specific intensity per unit frequency , @xmath367 , j_=10 ^ -21 j_21 ( )",
    "^ -^-2 ^ -1 ^-1 ^ -1  , [ inu ] where @xmath547 is the lyman limit frequency , and @xmath516 is the intensity at @xmath547 expressed in units of @xmath548 .",
    "the intensity is normalized to an expected post - reionization value of around unity for the ratio of ionizing photon density to the baryon density .",
    "different power laws can be used to represent either quasar spectra ( @xmath549 ) or stellar spectra ( @xmath550 ) .",
    "once the gas is heated throughout the halo , some fraction of it acquires a sufficiently high temperature that it becomes unbound .",
    "this gas expands due to the resulting pressure gradient and eventually evaporates back into the igm .",
    "the pressure gradient force ( per unit volume ) @xmath551 competes with the gravitational force of @xmath552 . due to the density gradient ,",
    "the ratio between the pressure force and the gravitational force is roughly equal to the ratio between the thermal energy @xmath553 and the gravitational binding energy @xmath554 ( which is @xmath555 at the virial radius @xmath398 ) per particle .",
    "thus , if the kinetic energy exceeds the potential energy ( or roughly if @xmath556 ) , the repulsive pressure gradient force exceeds the attractive gravitational force and expels the gas on a dynamical time ( or faster for halos with @xmath557 ) .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig6.7 ] ( adopted from figure  3 of barkana & loeb 1999 ) shows the fraction of gas within the virial radius which becomes unbound after reionization , as a function of the total halo circular velocity , with halo masses at @xmath558 indicated at the top .",
    "the two pairs of curves correspond to spectral index @xmath559 ( solid ) or @xmath560 ( dashed ) . in each pair , a calculation which assumes an optically - thin halo leads to the upper curve , but including radiative transfer and self - shielding modifies the result to the one shown by the lower curve . in each case",
    "self - shielding lowers the unbound fraction , but it mostly affects only a neutral core containing @xmath561 of the gas . since high energy photons above the lyman limit",
    "penetrate deep into the halo and heat the gas efficiently , a flattening of the spectral slope from @xmath559 to @xmath560 raises the unbound gas fraction .",
    "this figure is essentially independent of redshift if plotted in terms of circular velocity , but the conversion to a corresponding mass does vary with redshift .",
    "the characteristic circular velocity where most of the gas is lost is @xmath535@xmath562 , but clearly the effect of photo - evaporation is gradual , going from total gas removal down to no effect over a range of a factor of @xmath533 in halo mass .    given the values of the unbound gas fraction in halos of different masses , the press - schechter mass function (  [ sec2.4 ] ) can be used to calculate the total fraction of the igm which goes through the process of accreting onto a halo and then being recycled into the igm at reionization . the low - mass cutoff in this sum over halos",
    "is given by the lowest mass halo in which gas has assembled by the reionization redshift .",
    "this mass can be estimated by the linear jeans mass @xmath202 in equation ( [ eq : m_j ] ) in  [ sec3.1 ] .",
    "the jeans mass does not in general precisely equal the limiting mass for accretion ( see the discussion in the next section ) .",
    "indeed , at a given redshift some gas can continue to fall into halos of lower mass than the jeans mass at that redshift . on the other hand ,",
    "the larger jeans mass at higher redshifts means that a time - averaged jeans mass may be more appropriate , as indicated by the filtering mass . in practice , the jeans mass is sufficiently accurate since at @xmath56320 it agrees well with the values found in the numerical spherical collapse calculations of haiman , thoul , & loeb ( 1996 ) .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig6.7 ] ( adopted from figure  7 of barkana & loeb 1999 ) shows the total fraction of gas in the universe which evaporates from halos at reionization , versus the reionization redshift .",
    "the solid line assumes a spectral index @xmath560 , and the dotted line assumes @xmath559 , showing that the result is insensitive to the spectrum . even at high redshift ,",
    "the amount of gas which participates in photo - evaporation is significant , which suggests a number of possible implications as discussed below .",
    "the gas fraction shown in the figure represents most ( @xmath564@xmath565 depending on the redshift ) of the collapsed fraction before reionization , although some gas does remain in more massive halos .",
    "the photo - evaporation of gas out of large numbers of halos may have interesting implications .",
    "first , gas which falls into halos and is expelled at reionization attains a different entropy than if it had stayed in the low - density igm .",
    "the resulting overall reduction in the entropy is expected to be small  the same as would be produced by reducing the temperature of the entire igm by a factor of @xmath566  but localized effects near photo - evaporating halos may be more significant .",
    "furthermore , the resulting @xmath567 outflows induce small - scale fluctuations in peculiar velocity and temperature .",
    "these outflows are usually well below the resolution limit of most numerical simulations , but some outflows were resolved in the simulation of bryan et al .",
    "the evaporating halos may consume a significant number of ionizing photons in the post - overlap stage of reionization ( e.g. , haiman , abel , & madau 2000 ) , but a definitive determination requires detailed simulations which include the three - dimensional geometry of source halos and sink halos .",
    "although gas is quickly expelled out of the smallest halos , photo - evaporation occurs more gradually in larger halos which retain some of their gas .",
    "these surviving halos initially expand but they continue to accrete dark matter and to merge with other halos",
    ". these evaporating gas halos could contribute to the high column density end of the ly@xmath15 forest ( bond , szalay , & silk 1988 ) .",
    "abel & mo ( 1998 ) suggested that , based on the expected number of surviving halos , a large fraction of the lyman limit systems at @xmath458 may correspond to mini - halos that survived reionization .",
    "surviving halos may even have identifiable remnants in the present universe , as discussed in  [ sec9.3 ] .",
    "these ideas thus offer the possibility that a population of halos which originally formed prior to reionization may correspond almost directly to several populations that are observed much later in the history of the universe .",
    "however , the detailed dynamics of photo - evaporating halos are complex , and detailed simulations are required to confirm these ideas .",
    "photo - evaporation of a gas cloud has been followed in a two dimensional simulation with radiative transfer , by shapiro & raga ( 2000 ) .",
    "they found that an evaporating halo would indeed appear in absorption as a damped ly@xmath15 system initially , and as a weaker absorption system subsequently .",
    "future simulations will clarify the contribution to quasar absorption lines of the entire population of photo - evaporating halos .",
    "at the end of overlap , the cosmic ionizing background increased sharply , and the igm was heated by the ionizing radiation to a temperature @xmath29 k. due to the substantial increase in the igm temperature , the intergalactic jeans mass increased dramatically , changing the minimum mass of forming galaxies ( rees 1986 ; efstathiou 1992 ; gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; miralda - escud & rees 1998 ) .",
    "gas infall depends sensitively on the jeans mass .",
    "when a halo more massive than the jeans mass begins to form , the gravity of its dark matter overcomes the gas pressure . even in halos below the jeans mass , although the gas is initially held up by pressure , once the dark matter collapses its increased gravity pulls in some gas ( haiman , thoul , & loeb 1996 ) .",
    "thus , the jeans mass is generally higher than the actual limiting mass for accretion . before reionization ,",
    "the igm is cold and neutral , and the jeans mass plays a secondary role in limiting galaxy formation compared to cooling .",
    "after reionization , the jeans mass is increased by several orders of magnitude due to the photoionization heating of the igm , and hence begins to play a dominant role in limiting the formation of stars .",
    "gas infall in a reionized and heated universe has been investigated in a number of numerical simulations .",
    "thoul & weinberg ( 1996 ) inferred , based on a spherically - symmetric collapse simulation , a reduction of @xmath568 in the collapsed gas mass due to heating , for a halo of circular velocity @xmath569 at @xmath570 , and a complete suppression of infall below @xmath571 .",
    "kitayama & ikeuchi ( 2000 ) also performed spherically - symmetric simulations but included self - shielding of the gas , and found that it lowers the circular velocity thresholds by @xmath572 .",
    "three dimensional numerical simulations ( quinn , katz , & efstathiou 1996 ; weinberg , hernquist , & katz 1997 ; navarro & steinmetz 1997 ) found a significant suppression of gas infall in even larger halos ( @xmath573 ) , but this was mostly due to a suppression of late infall at @xmath574 .",
    "when a volume of the igm is ionized by stars , the gas is heated to a temperature @xmath575 k. if quasars dominate the uv background at reionization , their harder photon spectrum leads to @xmath576 k. including the effects of dark matter , a given temperature results in a linear jeans mass ( see  [ sec3.1 ] ) corresponding to a halo circular velocity of v_j=81 ( ) ^1/2 ^ 1/6  km  s^-1 , where we used equation  ( [ vceqn ] ) and assumed @xmath577 . in halos with @xmath578",
    ", the gas fraction in infalling gas equals the universal mean of @xmath130 , but gas infall is suppressed in smaller halos . even for a small dark matter halo ,",
    "once it collapses to a virial overdensity of @xmath579 relative to the mean , it can pull in additional gas .",
    "a simple estimate of the limiting circular velocity , below which halos have essentially no gas infall , is obtained by substituting the virial overdensity for the mean density in the definition of the jeans mass .",
    "the resulting estimate is v_lim=34 ( ) ^1/2  km  s^-1 .",
    "this value is in rough agreement with the numerical simulations mentioned above ( see also the related discussion in  [ sec3.2 ] ) .",
    "although the jeans mass is closely related to the rate of gas infall at a given time , it does not directly yield the total gas residing in halos at a given time .",
    "the latter quantity depends on the entire history of gas accretion onto halos , as well as on the merger histories of halos , and an accurate description must involve a time - averaged jeans mass .",
    "gnedin ( 2000b ) showed that the gas content of halos in simulations is well fit by an expression which depends on the filtering mass , a particular time - averaged jeans mass ( gnedin & hui 1998 ; see also  [ sec3.1 ] ) .",
    "gnedin ( 2000b ) calculated the jeans and filtering masses using the mean temperature in the simulation to define the sound speed , and found the following fit to the simulation results : |m_g=  , where @xmath580 is the average gas mass of all objects with a total mass @xmath103 , @xmath581 is the universal baryon fraction , and the characteristic mass @xmath582 is the total mass of objects which on average retain @xmath457 of their gas mass .",
    "the characteristic mass was well fit by the filtering mass at a range of redshifts from @xmath583 up to @xmath4 .",
    "star formation is accompanied by the violent death of massive stars in supernova explosions . in general",
    ", if each halo has a fixed baryon fraction and a fixed fraction of the baryons turns into massive stars , then the total energy in supernova outflows is proportional to the halo mass .",
    "the binding energies of both the supernova ejecta and of all the gas in the halo are proportional to the halo mass squared .",
    "thus , outflows are expected to escape more easily out of low - mass galaxies , and to expel a greater fraction of the gas from dwarf galaxies . at high redshifts ,",
    "most galaxies form in relatively low - mass halos , and the high halo merger rate leads to vigorous star formation .",
    "thus , outflows may have had a great impact on the earliest generations of galaxies , with consequences that may include metal enrichment of the igm and the disruption of dwarf galaxies . in this subsection",
    "we present a simple model for the propagation of individual supernova shock fronts in the igm .",
    "we discuss some implications of this model , but we defer to the following subsection the brunt of the discussion of the cosmological consequences of outflows .    for a galaxy forming in a given halo ,",
    "the supernova rate is related to the star formation rate . in particular , for a scalo ( 1998 ) initial stellar mass function , if we assume that a supernova is produced by each @xmath584 star , then on average one supernova explodes for every 126 @xmath585 of star formation , expelling an ejecta mass of @xmath586 including @xmath587 of heavy elements .",
    "we assume that the individual supernovae produce expanding hot bubbles which merge into a single overall region delineated by an outwardly moving shock front .",
    "we assume that most of the baryons in the outflow lie in a thin shell , while most of the thermal energy is carried by the hot interior .",
    "the total ejected mass , which is lifted out of the halo by the outflow , equals a fraction @xmath588 of the total halo gas mass .",
    "the ejected mass includes some of the supernova ejecta itself .",
    "we let @xmath589 denote the fraction of the supernova ejecta that winds up in the outflow ( with @xmath590 since some metals may be deposited in the disk and not ejected ) . since at high redshift most of the halo gas is likely to have cooled onto a disk , we assume that the mass carried by the outflow remains constant until the shock front reaches the halo virial radius .",
    "we assume an average supernova energy of @xmath591 erg , a fraction @xmath592 of which remains in the outflow after the outflow escapes from the disk .",
    "the outflow must overcome the gravitational potential of the halo , which we assume to have a navarro , frenk , & white ( 1997 ) density profile [ nfw ; see equation ( [ nfw ] ) in  ( [ sec2.3 ] ) ] .",
    "since the entire shell mass must be lifted out of the halo , we include the total shell mass as well as the total injected energy at the outset .",
    "this assumption is consistent with the fact that the burst of star formation in a halo is typically short compared to the total time for which the corresponding outflow expands .",
    "the escape of an outflow from an nfw halo depends on the concentration parameter @xmath133 of the halo .",
    "simulations by bullock et al .",
    "( 2000 ) indicate that the concentration parameter decreases with redshift , and their results may be extrapolated to our regime of interest ( i.e. , to smaller halo masses and higher redshifts ) by assuming that =( ) ^-0.1 .",
    "although we calculate below the dynamics of each outflow in detail , it is also useful to estimate which halos can generate large - scale outflows by comparing the kinetic energy of the outflow to the potential energy needed to completely escape ( i.e. , to infinite distance ) from an nfw halo . we thus find that the outflow can escape from its originating halo if the circular velocity is below a critical value given by v_crit = 200  km  s^-1  , [ vcrit ] where the efficiency @xmath593 is the fraction of baryons incorporated in stars , and g(x)=  .",
    "note that the contribution to @xmath588 of the supernova ejecta itself is @xmath594 , so the ejecta mass is usually negligible unless @xmath595 .",
    "equation ( [ vcrit ] ) can also be used to yield the maximum gas fraction @xmath588 which can be ejected from halos , as a function of their circular velocity .",
    "although this equation is most general , if we assume that the parameters @xmath588 and @xmath592 are independent of @xmath103 and @xmath69 then we can normalize them based on low - redshift observations . if we specify @xmath596 ( with @xmath597 ) at @xmath193 , then setting @xmath598 and @xmath599 yields the required energy efficiency as a function of the ejected halo gas fraction : = 1.5 ^2  .",
    "a value of @xmath600 is suggested by several theoretical and observational arguments which are discussed in the next subsection .",
    "however , these arguments are not conclusive , and @xmath601 may differ from this value by a large factor , especially at high redshift ( where outflows are observationally unconstrained at present ) .",
    "note the degeneracy between @xmath588 and @xmath592 which remains even if @xmath601 is specified .",
    "thus , if @xmath602 then a high efficiency @xmath603 is required to eject most of the gas from all halos with @xmath604 , but only @xmath605 is required to eject 510@xmath606 of the gas .",
    "the evolution of the outflow does depend on the value of @xmath592 and not just the ratio @xmath607 , since the shell accumulates material from the igm which eventually dominates over the initial mass carried by the outflow .",
    "we solve numerically for the spherical expansion of a galactic outflow , elaborating on the basic approach of tegmark , silk , & evrard ( 1993 ) .",
    "we assume that most of the mass @xmath608 carried along by the outflow lies in a thin , dense , relatively cool shell of proper radius @xmath99 .",
    "the interior volume , while containing only a fraction @xmath609 of the mass @xmath608 , carries most of the thermal energy in a hot , isothermal plasma of pressure @xmath610 and temperature @xmath347 .",
    "we assume a uniform exterior gas , at the mean density of the universe ( at each redshift ) , which may be neutral or ionized , and may exert a pressure @xmath611 as indicated below .",
    "we also assume that the dark matter distribution follows the nfw profile out to the virial radius , and is at the mean density of the universe outside the halo virial radius .",

    "the fraction @xmath620 of this energy which is re - injected into the interior depends on complex processes occurring near the shock front , including turbulence , non - equilibrium ionization and cooling , and so ( following tegmark et al .",

    "we set @xmath626 , in terms of the virial radius @xmath398 [ equation ( [ rvir ] ) ] of the source halo .",

    "the standard sedov - taylor self - similar solution ( sedov 1946 , 1959 ; taylor 1950 ) generalizes to the cosmological case as follows ( voit 1996 ) : =( ) ^1/5 ^2/5  , [ voit ] where @xmath635 and @xmath636 in terms of the initial ( i.e. , at @xmath637 and @xmath638 ) energy @xmath639 .",
    "numerically , the comoving radius is = 280 ( ) ^1/5 ( ) ^2/5  kpc  .    in solving the equations described above",

    "thus , the external pressure is included initially , it is turned off after the pre - ionized region recombines , and it is then switched back on at a lower redshift when the universe is reionized . when the ambient igm is neutral and the pressure is off , the shock loses energy to ionization . in practice",
    "we find that the external pressure is unimportant during the initial expansion , although it _ is _ generally important after reionization .",
    "also , at high redshift ionization losses are much smaller than losses due to compton cooling . in the results shown below , we assume an instantaneous reionization at @xmath640 .    figure  [ figvii1 ] shows the results for a starting redshift @xmath484 , for a halo of mass @xmath641 , stellar mass @xmath642 , comoving @xmath643 kpc , and circular velocity @xmath644 km / s .",

    "we freeze the radius at the point of maximum expansion ( where @xmath650 ) , since in reality the shell will at that point begin to spread and fill out the interior volume due to small - scale velocities in the igm .",
    "for the chosen parameters , the bubble easily escapes from the halo , but when @xmath592 and @xmath588 are decreased the accumulated igm mass slows down the outflow more effectively . in all cases the outflow reaches a size of 1020 times @xmath651 , i.e.",
    ", 100200 comoving kpc .",

    "the asymptotic size of the outflow varies roughly as @xmath655 , as predicted by the simple solution in equation ( [ voit ] ) , but the asymptotic size is rather insensitive to @xmath588 ( at a fixed @xmath592 ) since the outflow mass becomes dominated by the swept - up igm mass once @xmath656 . with the standard parameter values ( i.e. , those corresponding to the solid curve ) , figure  [ figvii1 ] also shows ( dot - long dashed curve ) the voit ( 1996 ) solution of equation ( [ voit ] ) .",
    "the voit solution behaves similarly to the no - reionization curve at low redshift , although it overestimates the shock radius by @xmath561 , and the overestimate is greater compared to the more realistic case which does include reionization .",
    "figure  [ figvii2 ] shows different curves than figure  [ figvii1 ] but on an identical layout .",
    "a single curve starting at @xmath484 ( solid curve ) is repeated from figure  [ figvii1 ] , and it is compared here to outflows with the same parameters but starting at @xmath194 ( dotted curve ) , @xmath174 ( short - dashed curve ) , and @xmath145 ( long - dashed curve ) .",
    "a @xmath644 km / s halo , with a stellar mass equal to @xmath657 of the total halo mass , is chosen at the three higher redshifts , but at @xmath145 a @xmath658 km / s halo is assumed .",
    "because of the suppression of gas infall after reionization (  [ sec6.5 ] ) , we assume that the @xmath145 outflow is produced by supernovae from a stellar mass equal to only @xmath659 of the total halo mass ( with a similarly reduced initial shell mass ) , thus leading to a relatively small final shell radius .",
    "the main conclusion from both figures is the following : in all cases , the outflow undergoes a rapid initial expansion over a fractional redshift interval @xmath660 , at which point the shell has slowed down to @xmath535 km / s from an initial 300 km / s .",
    "the rapid deceleration is due to the accumulating igm mass .",
    "external pressure from the reionized igm completely halts all high - redshift outflows , and even without this effect most outflows would only move at @xmath493 km / s after the brief initial expansion .",
    "thus , it may be possible for high - redshift outflows to pollute the lyman alpha forest with metals without affecting the forest hydrodynamically at @xmath661 . while the bulk velocities of these outflows may dissipate quickly",
    ", the outflows do sweep away the igm and create empty bubbles .",
    "the resulting effects on observations of the lyman alpha forest should be studied in detail ( some observational signatures of feedback have been suggested recently by theuns , mo , & schaye 2001 ) .",
    "barkana & loeb ( 2001 , in preparation ) derive the overall filling factor of supernova bubbles based on this formalism . in the following subsection we survey previous analytic and numerical work on the collective astrophysical effects of galactic outflows .",
    "galactic outflows represent a complex feedback process which affects the evolution of cosmic gas through a variety of phenomena .",
    "outflows inject hydrodynamic energy into the interstellar medium of their host galaxy .",
    "as shown in the previous subsection , even a small fraction of this energy suffices to eject most of the gas from a dwarf galaxy , perhaps quenching further star formation after the initial burst . at the same time",
    ", the enriched gas in outflows can mix with the interstellar medium and with the surrounding igm , allowing later generations of stars to form more easily because of metal - enhanced cooling . on the other hand",
    ", the expanding shock waves may also strip gas in surrounding galaxies and suppress star formation .",
    "dekel & silk ( 1986 ) attempted to explain the different properties of diffuse dwarf galaxies in terms of the effect of galactic outflows ( see also larson 1974 ; vader 1986 , 1987 ) .",
    "they noted the observed trends whereby lower - mass dwarf galaxies have a lower surface brightness and metallicity , but a higher mass - to - light ratio , than higher mass galaxies .",
    "they argued that these trends are most naturally explained by substantial gas removal from an underlying dark matter potential .",
    "galaxies lying in small halos can eject their remaining gas after only a tiny fraction of the gas has turned into stars , while larger galaxies require more substantial star formation before the resulting outflows can expel the rest of the gas . assuming a wind efficiency @xmath662 , dekel & silk showed that outflows in halos below a circular velocity threshold of @xmath663 km / s have sufficient energy to expel most of the halo gas . furthermore",
    ", cooling is very efficient for the characteristic gas temperatures associated with @xmath664 km / s halos , but it becomes less efficient in more massive halos . as a result , this critical velocity is expected to signify a dividing line between bright galaxies and diffuse dwarf galaxies .",
    "although these simple considerations may explain a number of observed trends , many details are still not conclusively determined .",
    "for instance , even in galaxies with sufficient energy to expel the gas , it is possible that this energy gets deposited in only a small fraction of the gas , leaving the rest almost unaffected .",
    "since supernova explosions in an inhomogeneous interstellar medium lead to complicated hydrodynamics , in principle the best way to determine the basic parameters discussed in the previous subsection ( @xmath592 , @xmath588 , and @xmath589 ) is through detailed numerical simulations of individual galaxies .",
    "mac low & ferrara ( 1999 ) simulated a gas disk within a @xmath193 dark matter halo .",
    "the disk was assumed to be azimuthal and initially smooth .",
    "they represented supernovae by a central source of energy and mass , assuming a constant luminosity which is maintained for 50 million years .",
    "they found that the hot , metal - enriched ejecta can in general escape from the halo much more easily than the colder gas within the disk , since the hot gas is ejected in a tube perpendicular to the disk without displacing most of the gas in the disk .",
    "in particular , most of the metals were expelled except for the case with the most massive halo considered ( with @xmath665 in gas ) and the lowest luminosity ( @xmath666 erg / s , or a total injection of @xmath667 erg ) . on the other hand ,",
    "only a small fraction of the total gas mass was ejected except for the least massive halo ( with @xmath668 in gas ) , where a luminosity of @xmath669 erg / s or more expelled most of the gas .",
    "we note that beyond the standard issues of numerical resolution and convergence , there are several difficulties in applying these results to high - redshift dwarf galaxies .",
    "clumping within the expanding shells or the ambient interstellar medium may strongly affect both the cooling and the hydrodynamics .",
    "also , the effect of distributing the star formation throughout the disk is unclear since in that case several characteristics of the problem will change ; many small explosions will distribute the same energy over a larger gas volume than a single large explosion [ as in the sedov - taylor solution ( sedov 1946 , 1959 ; taylor 1950 ) ; see , e.g. , equation ( [ voit ] ) ] , and the geometry will be different as each bubble tries to dig its own escape route through the disk .",
    "also , high - redshift disks should be denser by orders of magnitude than @xmath193 disks , due to the higher mean density of the universe at early times .",
    "thus , further numerical simulations of this process are required in order to assess its significance during the reionization epoch .",
    "some input on these issues also comes from observations .",
    "martin ( 1999 ) showed that the hottest extended x - ray emission in galaxies is characterized by a temperature of @xmath670 k. this hot gas , which is lifted out of the disk at a rate comparable to the rate at which gas goes into new stars , could escape from galaxies with rotation speeds of @xmath671 km / s .",
    "however , these results are based on a small sample that includes only the most vigorous star - forming local galaxies , and the mass - loss rate depends on assumptions about the poorly understood transfer of mass and energy among the various phases of the interstellar medium .",
    "many authors have attempted to estimate the overall cosmological effects of outflows by combining simple models of individual outflows with the formation rate of galaxies , obtained via semi - analytic methods ( couchman & rees 1986 ; blanchard , valls - gabaud , & mamon 1992 ; tegmark , et al .",
    "1993 ; voit 1996 ; nath & trentham 1997 ; prunet & blanchard 2000 ; ferrara , pettini , & shchekinov 2000 ; scannapieco & broadhurst 2000 ) or numerical simulations ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; gnedin 1998 ; cen & ostriker 1999 ; aguirre et al .",
    "the main goal of these calculations is to explain the characteristic metallicities of different environments as a function of redshift .",
    "for example , the igm is observed to be enriched with metals at redshifts @xmath672 .",
    "identification of , and absorption lines which correspond to ly@xmath15 absorption lines in the spectra of high - redshift quasars has revealed that the low - density igm has been enriched to a metal abundance ( by mass ) of @xmath673 , where @xmath674 is the solar metallicity ( meyer & york 1987 ; tytler et al .",

    "2000 ; prochaska & wolfe 2000 ) . the metal enrichment has been clearly identified down to column densities of @xmath675 .",
    "the detailed comparison of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with quasar absorption spectra has established that the forest of ly@xmath15 absorption lines is caused by the smoothly - fluctuating density of the neutral component of the igm ( cen et al .",
    "1994 ; zhang , anninos & norman 1995 ; hernquist et al .",
    "the simulations show a strong correlation between the column density and the gas overdensity @xmath676 ( e.g. , dav et al .",
    "1999 ) , implying that metals were dispersed into regions with an overdensity as low as @xmath677 or possibly even lower .    in general , dwarf galaxies are expected to dominate metal enrichment at high - redshift for several reasons . as noted above and in the previous subsection , outflows can escape more easily out of the potential wells of dwarfs .",
    "also , at high redshift , massive halos are rare and dwarf halos are much more common . finally , as already noted , the sedov - taylor solution ( sedov 1946 , 1959 ; taylor 1950 ) [ or equation ( [ voit ] ) ] implies that for a given total energy and expansion time , multiple small outflows ( i.e. , caused by explosions with a small individual energy release ) fill large volumes more effectively than would a smaller number of large outflows . note , however , that the strong effect of feedback in dwarf galaxies may also quench star formation rapidly and reduce the efficiency of star formation in dwarfs below that found in more massive galaxies .",
    "cen & ostriker ( 1999 ) showed via numerical simulation that metals produced by supernovae do not mix uniformly over cosmological volumes .",
    "instead , at each epoch the highest density regions have much higher metallicity than the low - density igm .",
    "they noted that early star formation occurs in the most overdense regions , which therefore reach a high metallicity ( of order a tenth of the solar value ) by @xmath678 , when the igm metallicity is lower by 12 orders of magnitude . at later times , the formation of high - temperature clusters in the highest - density regions suppresses star formation there , while lower - density regions continue to increase their metallicity .",
    "note , however , that the spatial resolution of the hydrodynamic code of cen & ostriker is a few hundred kpc , and anything occurring on smaller scales is inserted directly via simple parametrized models .",
    "scannapieco & broadhurst ( 2000 ) implemented expanding outflows within a numerical scheme which , while not a full gravitational simulation , did include spatial correlations among halos .",
    "they showed that winds from low - mass galaxies may also strip gas from nearby galaxies ( see also scannapieco , ferrara , & broadhurst 2000 ) , thus suppressing star formation in a local neighborhood and substantially reducing the overall abundance of galaxies in halos below a mass of @xmath679 .",
    "although quasars do not produce metals , they may also affect galaxy formation in their vicinity via energetic outflows ( efstathiou & rees 1988 ; babul & white 1991 ; silk & rees 1998 ; natarajan , sigurdsson , & silk 1998 ) .",
    "gnedin & ostriker ( 1997 ) and gnedin ( 1998 ) identified another mixing mechanism which , they argued , may be dominant at high redshift ( @xmath680 ) . in a collision between two proto - galaxies ,",
    "the gas components collide in a shock and the resulting pressure force can eject a few percent of the gas out of the merger remnant .",
    "this is the merger mechanism , which is based on gravity and hydrodynamics rather than direct stellar feedback .",
    "even if supernovae inject most of their metals in a local region , larger - scale mixing can occur via mergers .",
    "note , however , that gnedin s ( 1998 ) simulation assumed a comoving star formation rate at @xmath681 of @xmath682 per year per comoving mpc@xmath683 , which is 510 times larger than the observed rate at redshift 34 (  [ sec8.1 ] ) .",
    "aguirre et al.(2000a ) used outflows implemented in simulations to conclude that winds of @xmath684 km / s at @xmath685 can produce the mean metallicity observed at @xmath541 in the ly@xmath15 forest .",
    "aguirre et al.(2000b ) explored another process , where metals in the form of dust grains are driven to large distances by radiation pressure , thus producing large - scale mixing without displacing or heating large volumes of igm gas .",
    "the success of this mechanism depends on detailed microphysics such as dust grain destruction and the effect of magnetic fields .",
    "the scenario , though , may be directly testable because it leads to significant ejection only of elements which solidify as grains .",
    "feedback from galactic outflows encompasses a large variety of processes and influences .",

    "barkana & loeb ( 2000b ) argued that a detection of this fall in the faint luminosity function could be used to identify the reionization redshift observationally .    a model for the sfr can be constructed based on the extended press - schechter theory .",

    "this quantity was evaluated by lacey & cole [ 1993 , their equation  ( 2.18 ) ] , and it is the basis for modeling the rate of galaxy formation .    once a dark matter halo has collapsed and virialized , the two requirements for forming new stars are gas infall and cooling .",
    "we assume that by the time of reionization , photo - dissociation of molecular hydrogen ( see  [ sec3.3 ] ) has left only atomic transitions as an avenue for efficient cooling . before reionization , therefore , galaxies can form in halos down to a circular velocity of @xmath695 , where this limit is set by cooling . on the other hand , when a volume of the igm is ionized by stars or quasars , the gas is heated and the increased pressure suppresses gas infall into halos with a circular velocity below @xmath696 , halting infall below @xmath697 (  [ sec6.5 ] ) .",
    "since the suppression acts only in regions that have been heated , the reionization feedback on galaxy formation depends on the fraction of the igm which is ionized at each redshift . in order to include a gradual reionization in the model , we take the simulations of gnedin ( 2000a ) as a guide for the redshift interval of reionization .    in general ,",
    "new star formation in a given galaxy can occur either from primordial gas or from recycled gas which has already undergone a previous burst of star formation .",

    "numerical simulations of starbursts in interacting @xmath193 galaxies ( e.g. , mihos & hernquist 1994 ; 1996 ) found that a merger triggers significant star formation in a halo even if it merges with a much less massive partner .",

    "\\(iii ) all black holes share the same emission spectrum during their luminous phase .",
    "note that these assumptions relate only to the most luminous phase of the black hole accretion process , and they may not be valid during periods when the radiative efficiency or the mass accretion rate is very low .",
    "such periods are not of interest here since they do not affect the luminosity function of bright quasars , which is the observable we wish to predict .",
    "the first of the above assumptions is reasonable as long as the fraction of virialized baryons in the universe is much smaller than unity ; it does not include a separate mechanism for fueling black hole growth during mergers of previously - formed galaxies , and thus , under this assumption , black holes would not grow in mass once most of the baryons were virialized .",
    "the second hypothesis is motivated by the fact that for a sufficiently high fueling rate ( which may occur in the early stage of the collapse / merger of a galaxy ) , quasars are likely to shine at their maximum possible luminosity .",

    "lamb & reichart ( 2000 ) extrapolated the observed gamma - ray and afterglow spectra of known grbs to high redshifts and emphasized the important role that their detection could play in probing the igm ( see also miralda - escud 1998 ) .",
    "in particular , the broad - band afterglow emission can be used to probe the ionization and metal - enrichment histories of the intervening igm during the epoch of reionization .",
    "ciardi & loeb ( 2000 ) showed that unlike other sources ( such as galaxies and quasars ) , which fade rapidly with increasing redshift , the observed infrared flux from a grb afterglow at a fixed observed age is only a weak function of its redshift ( figure  [ fig8i ] ) .",
    "a simple scaling of the long - wavelength spectra and the temporal evolution of afterglows with redshift implies that at a fixed time - lag after the grb in the observer s frame , there is only a mild change in the _ observed _ flux at infrared or radio wavelengths with increasing redshift .",
    "this results in part from the fact that afterglows are brighter at earlier times , and that a given observed time refers to an earlier intrinsic time in the source frame as the source redshift increases .",
    "the `` apparent brightening '' of grb afterglows with redshift could be further enhanced by the expected increase with redshift of the mean density of the interstellar medium of galaxies ( wood & loeb 2000 ) .",

    "the predicted grb rate and flux are subject to uncertainties regarding the beaming of the emission .",
    "the beaming angle may vary with observed time due to the decline with time of the lorentz factor @xmath790 of the emitting material . as long as the lorentz factor is significantly larger than the inverse of the beaming angle ( i.e. , @xmath791 ) , the afterglow flux behaves as if it were emitted by a spherically - symmetric fireball with the same explosion energy per unit solid angle .",
    "however , the lightcurve changes as soon as @xmath214 declines below @xmath792 , due to the lateral expansion of the jet ( rhoads 1997 , 1999a , b ; panaitescu & mszros 1999 ) .",
    "finally , the isotropization of the energy ends when the expansion becomes sub - relativistic , at which point the remnant recovers the spherically - symmetric sedov - taylor solution ( sedov 1946 , 1959 ; taylor 1950 ) with the total remaining energy . when @xmath793 , the emission occurs from a roughly spherical fireball with the effective explosion energy per solid angle reduced by a factor of @xmath794 relative to that at early times , representing the fraction of sky around the grb source which is illuminated by the initial two ( opposing ) jets of angular radius @xmath795 ( see ciardi & loeb 2000 for the impact of this effect on the number counts ) .",
    "the calibration of the grb event rate per comoving volume , based on the number counts of grbs ( wijers et al .",
    "1998 ) , is inversely proportional to this factor .",
    "the main difficulty in using grbs as probes of the high - redshift universe is that they are rare , and hence their detection requires surveys which cover a wide area of the sky .",

    "the ground - state hyperfine levels of hydrogen tend to thermalize with the cmb background , making the igm unobservable .",

    "thus the critical value of @xmath896 is given by the thermalization rate ( madau et al .",

    "since the cmb temperature is only @xmath905 k , even relatively inefficient heating mechanisms are expected to heat the igm above @xmath906 well before reionization .",
    "possible preheating sources include soft x - rays from early quasars or star - forming regions , as well as thermal bremsstrahlung from ionized gas in collapsing halos",

    "only @xmath709 of the present - day global star formation rate is required ( madau et al .",
    "1997 ) for a sufficiently strong ly@xmath15 background which produces a scattering rate above the thermalization rate @xmath907 .",
    "such a background drives @xmath882 to the kinetic gas temperature , which is initially lower than @xmath892 because of adiabatic expansion .",
    "thus , the entire igm can be seen in absorption , but the igm is then heated above @xmath892 in @xmath908 yr ( madau et al .",

    "according to  [ sec8.1 ] ( also compare gnedin 2000a ) , the required level of star formation is expected to be reached already at @xmath292 , with the entire igm heated well above the cmb by the time overlap begins at @xmath909 .",
    "thus , although the initial absorption signal is in principle detectable with the ska ( tozzi et al .",

    "as individual ionizing sources turn on in the pre - overlap stage of reionization , the resulting bubbles may be individually detectable if they are produced by rare and luminous sources such as quasars .",
    "if the region expands into an otherwise unperturbed igm , then the expanding shell can be mapped as follows ( tozzi et al .",
    "the region itself , of course , shows neither emission nor absorption . outside the ionized bubble",
    ", a thin shell of neutral gas is heated above the cmb temperature and shows up in emission .",
    "a much thicker outer shell is cooler than the cmb due to adiabatic expansion , but satisfies @xmath911 and produces absorption .",
    "finally , at large distances from the quasar , @xmath882 approaches @xmath892 as the quasar radiation weakens . for a quasar with an ionizing intensity of @xmath912 photons",

    "mapping such regions would convey information on the quasar number density , ionizing intensity , opening angle , and on the density distribution in the surrounding igm .",
    "note , however , that an region which forms at a redshift approaching overlap expands into a preheated igm . in this case",
    ", the region itself still appears as a hole in an otherwise emitting medium , but the quasar - induced heating is not probed , and there is no surrounding region of absorption to supply an enhanced contrast .    at redshifts approaching overlap",
    ", the igm should be almost entirely neutral but with @xmath902 . in this redshift range",
    "there should still be an interesting signal due to density fluctuations .",
    "the same cosmic network of sheets and filaments that gives rise to the ly@xmath15 forest observed at @xmath915 should lead to fluctuations in the 21 cm brightness temperature at higher redshifts . at 150 mhz ( @xmath916 ) , for observations with a bandwidth of 1 mhz , the root mean square fluctuation should be @xmath535 mk at @xmath917 , decreasing with scale ( tozzi et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "a further signature , observable over the entire sky , should mark the overlap stage of reionization . during overlap",
    ", the igm is transformed from being a neutral , preheated and thus emitting gas , to being almost completely ionized .",
    "this disappearance of the emission over a relatively narrow redshift range can be observed as a drop in the brightness temperature at the frequencies corresponding to the latter stages of overlap ( shaver et al .",
    "this exciting possibility , along with those mentioned above , face serious challenges in terms of signal contamination and calibration .",
    "the noise sources include galactic and extragalactic emission sources , as well as terrestrial interference , and all of these foregrounds must be modeled and accurately removed in order to observe the fainter cosmological signal ( see shaver et al .",
    "1999 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "for the overlap stage in particular , the sharpness of the spectral feature is the key to its detectability , but it may be significantly smoothed by inhomogeneities in the igm .      in standard cosmological models ,",
    "the early universe was hot and permeated by a nearly uniform radiation bath . at @xmath73 the free protons and electrons recombined to form hydrogen atoms , and most of the photons last scattered as the scattering cross - section dropped precipitously .",
    "these photons , observed today as the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , thus yield a snapshot of the state of the universe at that early time .",
    "small fluctuations in the density , velocity , and gravitational potential lead to observed anisotropies ( e.g. , sachs & wolfe 1967 ; bennett et al .",
    "1996 ) that can be analyzed to yield a great wealth of information on the matter content of the universe and on the values of the cosmological parameters ( e.g. , hu 1995 ; jungman et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "reionization can alter the anisotropy spectrum , by erasing some of the primary anisotropy imprinted at recombination , and by generating additional secondary fluctuations that could be used to probe the era of reionization itself ( see haiman & knox 1999 for a review ) .",
    "the primary anisotropy is damped since the rescattering leads to a blending of photons from initially different lines of sight .",
    "furthermore , not all the photons scatter at the same time , rather the last scattering surface has a finite thickness .",
    "perturbations on scales smaller than this thickness are damped since photons scattering across many wavelengths give canceling redshifts and blueshifts .",
    "if reionization occurs very early , the high electron density produces efficient scattering , and perturbations are damped on all angular scales except for the very largest .",
    "the optical depth to scattering over a proper length @xmath918 is @xmath919 , where @xmath920 is the thomson cross - section and @xmath921 the density of free electrons .",
    "if reionization occurs instantaneously at redshift @xmath69 , then the total scattering optical depth in @xmath30cdm is given by ( e.g. , ",
    "7.1.1 of hu 1995 ) = 0.041 \\ { ^1/2 - 1 }  . with our standard parameters ( end of  [ sec1 ] )",
    "this implies @xmath922 at the current lower limit on reionization of @xmath14 ( fan et al .",
    "2000 ) , with @xmath923 if @xmath924 and @xmath925 if @xmath926 .",
    "recent observations of small - scale anisotropies ( lange et al .",
    "2000 ; balbi et al .  2000 ) revealed a peak in the power spectrum on a @xmath40 scale , as expected from the primary anisotropies in standard cosmological models .",
    "this indicates that the reionization damping , if present , is not very large , and the observations set a limit of @xmath927 at @xmath928 confidence ( tegmark & zaldarriaga 2000 ) and , therefore , imply that reionization must have occurred at @xmath929 .",
    "however , measuring a small @xmath740 from the temperature anisotropies alone is expected to be very difficult since the anisotropy spectrum depends on a large number of other parameters , creating a near - degeneracy which limits our ability to measure each parameter separately ; the degeneracy of @xmath740 with other cosmological parameters is due primarily to a degeneracy with the gravitational - wave background .",
    "however , thomson scattering also creates net polarization for incident radiation which has a quadrupole anisotropy .",
    "this anisotropy was significant at reionization due to large - scale structure which had already affected the gas distribution .",
    "the result is a peak in the polarization power spectrum on large angular scales of order tens of degrees ( zaldarriaga 1997 ) .",
    "although experiments must overcome systematic errors from the detector itself and from polarized foregrounds ( such as galactic dust emission and synchrotron radiation ) , parameter estimation models ( eisenstein , hu , & tegmark 1999 ; zaldarriaga , spergel , & seljak 1997 ) suggest that the peak can be used to measure even very small values of @xmath740 : @xmath654 for the upcoming map satellite , and @xmath930 for the planck satellite which will reach smaller angular scales with higher accuracy .",
    "reionization should also produce additional temperature anisotropies on small scales .",
    "these result from the doppler effect . by the time of reionization ,",
    "the baryons have begun to follow dark matter potentials and have acquired a bulk velocity . since the electrons move with respect to the radiation background , photons are given a doppler kick when they scatter off the electrons .",
    "sunyaev ( 1978 ) and kaiser ( 1984 ) showed , however , that a severe cancellation occurs if the electron density is homogeneous .",
    "opposite doppler shifts on crests and troughs of a velocity perturbation combine to suppress the anisotropy induced by small - scale velocity perturbations .",
    "the cancellation is made more severe by the irrotational nature of gravitationally - induced flows . however ,",
    "if the electron density varies spatially , then the scattering probability is not equal on the crest and on the trough , and the two do not completely cancel .",
    "since a non - zero effect requires variation in both electron density and velocity , it is referred to as a second - order anisotropy .",
    "the electron density can vary due to a spatial variation in either the baryon density or the ionized fraction .",
    "the former is referred to as the ostriker - vishniac effect ( ostriker & vishniac 1986 ; vishniac 1987 ) .",
    "the latter depends on the inhomogeneous topology of reionization , in particular on the size of regions due to individual sources (  [ sec6.2 ] ) and on spatial correlations among different regions .",
    "simple models have been used to investigate the character of anisotropies generated during reionization ( gruzinov & hu 1998 ; knox et al .",
    "1998 ; aghanim et al .",
    "the ostriker - vishniac effect is expected to dominate all anisotropies at small angular scales ( e.g. , jaffe & kamionkowski 1998 ) , below a tenth of a degree , because the primary anisotropies are damped on such small scales by diffusion ( silk damping ) and by the finite thickness of the last scattering surface .",
    "anisotropies generated by inhomogeneous reionization may be comparable to the ostriker - vishniac effect , and could be detected by map and planck , if reionization is caused by bright quasars with 10 mpc - size ionized bubbles . however , the smaller bubbles expected for mini - quasars or for star - forming dwarf galaxies would produce an anisotropy signal which is weaker and at smaller angular scales , likely outside the range of the upcoming satellites ( see , e.g. , haiman & knox 1999 for discussion ) . gnedin & jaffe ( 2000 ) used a numerical simulation to show that",
    ", in the case of stellar reionization , the effect on the cmb of patchy reionization is indeed sub - dominant compared to the contribution of non - linear density and velocity fluctuations .",
    "nevertheless , a signature of reionization could still be detected in future measurements of cmb angular fluctuations on the scale of a few arcseconds ( see also bruscoli 2000 , who find a somewhat higher power spectrum due to patchy reionization ) .      at the end of the reionization epoch ,",
    "the heating of the igm resulted in the photo - evaporation of gas out of halos of circular velocity @xmath399 above @xmath535@xmath931 (  [ sec6.4 ] ) .",
    "the pressure of the hot gas subsequently shut off gas infall into even more massive halos , those with @xmath932 (  [ sec6.5 ] ) .",
    "thus , the gas reservoir of photo - evaporating halos could not be immediately replenished .",
    "some dwarf galaxies which were prevented from forming after reionization could have eventually collected gas at @xmath9332 , when the uv background flux declined sufficiently ( babul & rees 1992 ; kepner , babul , & spergel 1997 )",
    ". however , kepner et al .  (",
    "1997 ) found that even if the ionizing intensity @xmath516 declines as @xmath934 below @xmath521 , only halos with @xmath935 can form atomic hydrogen by @xmath933 , and @xmath936 is required to form molecular hydrogen .",
    "while the fact that the igm was reionized has almost certainly influenced the abundance and properties of dwarf galaxies observed today , the exact manifestations of this influence and ways to prove that they occurred have not been well determined . in this section",
    "we summarize recent work on this topic , which should remain an active research area .",
    "the suppression of gas infall mentioned above suggests that the abundance of luminous halos as a function of circular velocity should show a break , with a significant drop in the abundance below @xmath937 .",
    "such a drop may in fact be required in order to reconcile the @xmath30cdm model with observations .",
    "klypin et al.(1999 ) and moore et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found that the abundance of halos with @xmath938@xmath939 in numerical simulations of the local group environment is higher by an order of magnitude than the observed dwarf galaxy abundance .",
    "the predicted and observed abundances matched well at @xmath940 .",
    "bullock et al .  ( 2000a ) considered whether photoionization can explain the discrepancy at the low - mass end by preventing dark matter halos from forming stars .",
    "they assumed that a sub - halo in the local group can host an observable galaxy only if already at reionization its main progenitor contained a fraction @xmath941 of the final sub - halo mass . using semi - analytic modeling",
    ", they found a close match to the observed circular velocity distribution for @xmath714 and @xmath942 .",
    "these results neglect several complications .",
    "as mentioned above , halos with @xmath935 may be able to accrete gas and form stars once again at @xmath943 .",
    "any accreted gas at low redshift could have been previously enriched with metals and molecules , thus enabling more efficient cooling . on the other hand ,",
    "if the progenitors had a @xmath944 at @xmath712 then they were not able to cool and form stars , unless molecular hydrogen had not been dissociated (  [ sec3.3 ] ) . in order to reconcile the photoionization scenario with the recent episodes of star formation deduced to have occurred in most dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , mateo 1998 ; grebel 1998 ) , a continuous recycling of gas over many generations of stars must be assumed .",
    "this would mean that supernova feedback (  [ sec7.1 ] ) was unable to shut off star formation even in these smallest known galaxies .",
    "in addition , the existence of a large abundance of sub - halos may be problematic even if the sub - halos have no gas , since they would interact with the disk dynamically and tend to thicken it ( toth & ostriker 1992 ; moore et al .",
    "1999 ; velazquez & white 1999 ) .    however , the photoionization scenario is useful because it may be testable through other implications .",
    "for example , bullock et al .  ( 2001 ) used semi - analytic modeling to show that many subhalos which did form stars before reionization were tidally disrupted in the milky way s gravitational field , and the resulting stellar streams may be observable .",
    "the formation of the milky way s stellar component has also been investigated by white & springel ( 1999 ) .",
    "they combined a scaled - down dark matter cluster simulation with semi - analytic prescriptions for star formation in halos , and showed that the oldest stars in the milky way should be located mostly in the inner halo or bulge , but they can not be easily identified because the populations of old stars and of low metallicity stars are only weakly correlated .",
    "gnedin ( 2000c ) pointed out several observed features of dwarf galaxies that may be related to their high - redshift histories .",
    "first , almost all local group dwarf galaxies with measured star formation histories show a sharp decline in the star formation rate around 10 gyr ago .",
    "gnedin noted that this drop could correspond to the suppression of star formation due to reionization (  [ sec6.5 ] ) if the measured ages of the old stellar populations are somewhat underestimated ; or that it could instead correspond to the additional suppression caused by helium reionization (  [ sec6.3.2 ] ) at @xmath945 .",
    "he showed that if only the old stellar population is considered , then the schmidt law (  [ sec5.2 ] ) implies that the luminosity of each dwarf galaxy , divided by a characteristic volume containing a fixed fraction of all the old stars , should be proportional to some power of the central luminosity density .",
    "this assumes that the present central luminosity density of old stars is a good measure of the original gas density , i.e. , that in the core almost all the gas was transformed into stars , and feedback did not play a role .",
    "it also assumes that the gas density distribution was self - similar in all the dwarf galaxies during the period when they formed stars , and that the length of this period was also the same in all galaxies .",
    "these assumptions are required in order for the total stellar content of each galaxy to be simply related to the central density via the schmidt law evaluated at the center .",
    "taking ten galaxies which have well - measured star formation histories , and which formed most of their stars more than 10 gyr ago , gnedin found a correlation with a power law of @xmath946 , as expected from the schmidt law (  [ sec5.2 ] ) .",
    "clearly , the theoretical derivation of this correlation combines many simplistic assumptions .",
    "however , explaining the observed correlation is a challenge for any competing models , e.g. , models where feedback plays a dominant role in regulating star formation .",
    "barkana & loeb ( 1999 ) noted that a particularly acute puzzle is presented by the very smallest galaxies , the nine dwarf spheroidals in the local group with central velocity dispersions @xmath947 , including five below @xmath948 ( see recent reviews by mateo 1998 & van den bergh 2000 ) .",
    "these galaxies contain old stars that must have formed at @xmath949 , before the ionizing background dropped sufficiently to allow them to form .",
    "there are several possible solutions to the puzzle of how these stars formed in such small halos or in their progenitors which likely had even smaller velocity dispersions .",
    "the solutions are that ( i ) molecular hydrogen allowed these stars to form at @xmath718 , as noted above , ( ii ) the measured stellar velocity dispersions of the dwarf galaxies are well below the velocity dispersions of their dark matter halos , or ( iii ) the dwarf galaxies did not form via the usual hierarchical scenario .",
    "one major uncertainty in comparing observations to hierarchical models is the possibility that the measured velocity dispersion of stars in the dwarf spheroidals underestimates the velocity dispersion of their dark halos . assuming that the stars are in equilibrium",
    ", their velocity dispersion could be lower than that of the halo if the mass profile is shallower than isothermal beyond the stellar core .",
    "the velocity dispersion and mass - to - light ratio of a dwarf spheroidal could also appear high if the galaxy is non - spherical or the stellar orbits are anisotropic .",
    "the observed properties of dwarf spheroidals require a central mass density of order @xmath950 pc@xmath951 ( e.g. , mateo 1998 ) , which is @xmath952 times the present critical density .",
    "thus , only the very inner parts of the halos are sampled by the central velocity dispersion .",
    "detailed observations of the velocity dispersion profiles of these galaxies could be used to determine the circular velocity of the underlying halo more reliably .    a cosmological scenario for the formation of dwarf spheroidal galaxies is favored by the fact that they are observed to be dark matter dominated , but",
    "this may not rule out all the alternatives .",
    "the dwarf dark halos may have formed at low redshift by the breakup of a much larger galaxy . under this scenario ,",
    "gas forming stars inside the large parent galaxy would have been unaffected by the photoionizing background . at low redshift",
    ", this galaxy may have collided with the milky way or come close enough to be torn apart , forming at least some of the dwarf spheroidal systems .",
    "simulations of galaxy encounters ( barnes & hernquist 1992 ; elmegreen , kaufman , & thomasson 1993 ) have found that shocks in the tidal tails trigger star formation and lead to the formation of dwarf galaxies , but these galaxies contain only small amounts of dark matter .",
    "however , the initial conditions of these simulations assumed parent galaxies with a smooth dark matter distribution rather than clumpy halos with dense sub - halos inside them .",
    "as noted above , simulations ( klypin et al .",
    "1999 ; moore et al.1999 ) suggest that galaxy halos may have large numbers of dark matter satellites , and further simulations are needed to test whether these subhalos can capture stars which form naturally in tidal tails .",
    "a common origin for the milky way s dwarf satellites ( and a number of halo globular clusters ) , as remnants of larger galaxies accreted by the milky way galaxy , has been suggested on independent grounds .",
    "these satellites appear to lie along two ( e.g. , majewski 1994 ) or more ( lynden - bell & lynden - bell 1995 , fusi - pecci et al .",
    "1995 ) polar great circles .",
    "the star formation history of the dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , grebel 1998 ) constrains their merger history , and implies that the fragmentation responsible for their appearance must have occurred early in order to be consistent with the variation in stellar populations among the supposed fragments ( unavane , wyse , & gilmore 1996 ; olszewski 1998 ) .",
    "observations of interacting galaxies ( outside the local group ) also demonstrate that `` tidal dwarf galaxies '' do indeed form ( e.g. , duc & mirabel 1997 ; hunsberger , charlton , & zaritsky 1996 ) .",
    "_ when and how did the first stars and black holes form and when and how did they ionize most of the gas in the universe ? _ in this review we have sketched the first attempts to answer these questions and the basic physical principles that underlie these attempts .",
    "the coming decade will likely be marked by major advances in our ability to make theoretical predictions in an attempt to answer these questions , and will culminate with the launch of _ ngst _ , a telescope which is ideally suited for testing these predictions . at about the same time , the planck satellite ( and perhaps map before it ) is expected to directly infer the reionization redshift from measurements of the cmb polarization power spectrum on large angular scales . also in about a decade , next - generation arrays of radio telescopes may detect the 21 cm emission from the pre - reionization , neutral warm igm .",
    "the difficult questions just mentioned will receive their ultimate answers from observations , but it surely is fun to try to find the answers theoretically in advance , before we can deduce them by looking through our most technologically - advanced telescopes .",
