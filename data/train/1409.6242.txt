    "always , these facts together tell us that @xmath83 has two independent fixed points , @xmath194 and @xmath195 . but",
    "this contradicts the assumption of finite @xmath39 , and thus can not be the case for our system .",
    "thus , we must have @xmath164 , which completes the second desired implication , and thus finishes our proof of theorem  2 .",
    "while the physical interpretation of @xmath38 in our protocol is straightforward , simply being the characteristic length scale of our rg flow , the interpretation of @xmath39 is somewhat less clear . in this section ,",
    "we take a closer look at this quantity by means of our toy model .",
    "our toy model has three points for which @xmath39 is divergent .",
    "two of these points , those on the poles of our parameter space , start out as long - range correlated states before @xmath10-buffering , and thus are nt particularly interesting",
    ". however , the last point , lying at @xmath196 ( for @xmath197 ) , possesses a correlation length that is only made divergent under @xmath10-buffering .",
    "we hope to clarify this behavior here by exhibiting the somewhat pathological behavior of this point under @xmath10-buffering .      * z - buffering acts as @xmath198 , which has a non - trivial effect only on the junk space . * since the eigenvector of @xmath42 with largest eigenvalue is either @xmath146 ( when @xmath199 ) or @xmath200 ( when @xmath201 ) , we have @xmath202 .",
    "* thus , for the portion of our parameter space with @xmath203 , our junk space components at the @xmath204 limit satisfy @xmath205 { { \\ensuremath{\\left|+\\right\\rangle}}\\!\\!{\\ensuremath{\\left\\langle+\\right|}}}$ ] , and @xmath206 { { \\ensuremath{\\left|+\\right\\rangle}}\\!\\!{\\ensuremath{\\left\\langle+\\right|}}}$ ] .",
    "however , setting @xmath207 to @xmath208 shows that at this point , @xmath209 . in the language of appendix",
    "[ sec : zbproof ] , this is equivalent to @xmath210 , which is to say that the leading order term in @xmath124 vanishes . in this case , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : apm ] ) and from the fact that @xmath211 for our toy model , we see that the dominant terms in our junk space components lie within @xmath125 .",
    "this conclusion , along with eq .",
    "( [ eq : renormalizedmeasurement ] ) , tells us that the rg limit of our effective protected space operation is @xmath212 , a rotation in the opposite direction than we intended .",
    "while this can be accounted for by changing the interpretation we attach to our measurement outcomes , this selective change in interpretation would render our protocol no longer state - insensitive .",
    "thus , for consistency , we must rule this state out as a valid resource state for mqc under @xmath10-buffering .",
    "the sharp dip in the gate fidelity seen at @xmath213 in figure  [ fig : three_plots ] is the natural consequence of making such a consistent choice of gate fidelity .    finally , we explain the strange behavior seen in the value of @xmath46 at @xmath208 .",
    "while this behavior appears quite surprising , it is explained by the fact that the channel @xmath83 is @xmath214 at this point .",
    "thus , even though the junk space of our system is restricted to a one - dimensional subspace here , the protected space portion of @xmath83 becomes degenerate at the rg fixed point .",
    "consequently , the limit form of @xmath46 is not given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : orderparameter ] ) , but rather by @xmath215 this completes our examination of the behavior of the @xmath196 point in our parameter space . our intent in this , besides simply giving a complete account of our toy model ,",
    "is to demonstrate that states with divergent @xmath39 have rather pathological behavior that makes them unfit for use in our protocol .",
    "thus , even without a concrete physical interpretation for this quantity , the stipulation of finite @xmath39 is clearly necessary in both of our theorems ."

    "<S> in retrospect , this feature was first observed for certain ground states of the @xmath12 spto phase , like in the spin-1 xxz heisenberg model , as its so - called localizable entanglement diverges , and can thus be used to implement the identity channel @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> @xcite suggests that the resource characterization of the @xmath12 spto phase is limited to the identity channel ( namely teleportation ) . if we perform some non - pauli measurement , such as that in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> it can be shown that the classification of spto phases for on - site @xmath33 symmetry is identical to the case of @xmath12 , and consequently , any mps in the @xmath33 spto phase is automatically in the @xmath12 spto phase . </S>",
    "<S> this makes eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : protjunk ] ) applicable also to states in the @xmath33 spto phase , but the larger symmetry of @xmath33 imposes finer constraints on mps s in the @xmath33 spto phase . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that this abstract characterization of spto phases is useful for making general statements , like the following two theorems , without specifying a system hamiltonian or other microscopic details ( although one could define a formal , local hamiltonian for every mps ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we study this @xmath33 spto phase by means of an operational `` renormalization '' protocol called @xmath10-buffering , which extracts macroscopic features common among ground states within the phase . </S>",
    "<S> this protocol , shown in figure  [ fig : schematic ] , consists of sequential _ single - spin _ measurements , with postselection for a desired measurement outcome which depends on the type of rotation we wish to implement . </S>",
    "<S> we first select a site , the computational site , which will eventually be used to generate the desired unitary rotation . </S>",
    "<S> pauli measurements are then performed on the @xmath34 sites on each side of this site . if we want to implement a @xmath10-axis rotation using the computational site , we postselect for the all-@xmath35 outcome on these @xmath36 buffering sites , a process called @xmath10-buffering . </S>",
    "<S> similarly for @xmath8-axis rotations , @xmath8-buffering is utilized by postselecting the all-@xmath37 outcome . </S>",
    "<S> the ability to perform @xmath10 and @xmath8-axis rotations is all we need , since any single - qubit unitary gate can then be constructed using euler angles .    </S>",
    "<S> if our desired outcome is nt obtained , we just measure the computational site in the pauli basis and repeat this process on the next part of our spin chain , the state of our protected space simply being teleported by this undesired measurement outcome . </S>",
    "<S> note that the probability of postselection is accounted for as overhead in the chain length , but this does not qualitatively change the resource quality ( and its complexity ) , as long as it is finite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if our postselection succeeds , then the remaining computational state is renormalized by an amount depending on the ratio of @xmath34 to a characteristic length scale , called the @xmath10-correlation length @xmath38 , which governs this rg flow for each state . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath38 is finite , this rg flow generally terminates on a fixed point , which can be used to implement non - pauli operations . the exception to </S>",
    "<S> this rule is for certain pathological states , where the act of @xmath10-buffering causes the state to become long - range correlated , in that the renormalized correlation length @xmath39 becomes infinite . </S>",
    "<S> this resource characterization is summarized in the following theorem :    -buffering , we choose a computational site , and measure @xmath34 surrounding sites in the pauli basis . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) if our measurement fails to produce the all-@xmath35 outcome , the computational site is measured in the pauli basis , and we try again on another region . </S>",
    "<S> since all of our measurement outcomes simply induce pauli operations , the state of the protected space is ( up to byproducts ) unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) if our measurement succeeds , the resource quality of our computational site is improved , at least when @xmath38 is finite ( theorem  [ thm : zb]).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    [ thm : zb ] consider any ground state of the 1d @xmath33 symmetry - protected topological ordered phase , which is characterized by a certain @xmath10-correlation length @xmath38 and a renormalized correlation length @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> as long as @xmath38 and @xmath39 are both finite , the intrinsic entanglement of this state enables us to efficiently implement all one - qubit unitary operations under the setting of measurement - based quantum computation with arbitrarily high gate fidelity .        </S>",
    "<S> the fact that our protocol enables the behavior described in theorem  [ thm : zb ] is proven in appendix  a. the main idea behind our proof @xcite is that our mps resource state , by virtue of being in the @xmath12 spto phase , will have spto degeneracy in the protected space , but generally not in the junk space . </S>",
    "<S> when we postselect for a repeated @xmath35 outcome , we maintain this protected space degeneracy , but preferentially amplify a one - dimensional subspace of the junk space . after enough buffering , </S>",
    "<S> the junk space is sufficiently restricted to this one - dimensional subspace , corresponding to the largest eigenvalue @xmath41 of @xmath42 , so that our renormalized system can be treated effectively like the aklt state . </S>",
    "<S> the length scale over which this happens , @xmath38 , is set by the ratio of the largest to the second largest eigenvalue . </S>",
    "<S> the expected measurement overhead per gate required to achieve a gate fidelity @xmath43 is @xmath44 when the two largest eigenvalues of @xmath42 become degenerate , corresponding to a divergence in @xmath38 , @xmath10-buffering can not completely restrict the junk space , and our rg flow stalls before reaching an aklt - like state .    </S>",
    "<S> theorem  [ thm : zb ] says that the ground states of the @xmath33 spto phase generally share a common computational capability to implement perfect one - qubit gate operations . since such capability </S>",
    "<S> is conveniently characterized in qip by a measure called the gate fidelity , one could ask conversely `` could the gate fidelity be utilized as an alternative , operationally - motivated order parameter for quantum phases of matter ? '' our second theorem below , proven in appendix  b , states a surprising correspondence between the gate fidelity and ( a type of ) so - called string order parameter @xcite , within the @xmath33 spto phase .    </S>",
    "<S> [ thm : gf ] for any ground state in the 1d @xmath33 symmetry - protected topologically ordered phase with finite @xmath39 , the gate fidelity of all one - qubit operations in measurement - based quantum computation is perfect if and only if the order parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 take maximal values of @xmath19 when these quantities are evaluated upon completion of renormalization .    note </S>",
    "<S> that our order parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 are specializations of the string order parameters @xmath47 from @xcite to the case of @xmath32 rotations about the @xmath8 and @xmath10 axes , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . in @xcite , these string order parameters are argued to be capable of detecting the presence of quantum phase transitions between different spto phases . </S>",
    "<S> our order parameters are given by : @xmath50 the state @xmath51 is the state of our many - body mps after it has been mapped to the rg fixed point under @xmath14-buffering , where @xmath14 is either @xmath8 or @xmath10 . while our bare spin chain possesses full @xmath33 symmetry , the process of renormalization breaks symmetry by picking out a preferred direction ( the @xmath8 or @xmath10 axis ) . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the symmetry group of @xmath51 is reduced to @xmath52 , which consists of the 8 rotations within @xmath33 that preserve this preferred axis .    _ </S>",
    "<S> _ illustration of our results.__to demonstrate theorems [ thm : zb ] and [ thm : gf ] , we study the behavior of mps s in the @xmath33 spto phase with a two - dimensional junk space . </S>",
    "<S> we have developed a general formalism based on representation theory @xcite , and can show that spin-1 mps s of this form make up a two - parameter family that is isomorphic to a sphere . </S>",
    "<S> choosing variables @xmath53 and @xmath54 , with @xmath55 and @xmath56 , gives a unique parameterization of this family of mps s . because @xmath33 symmetry includes @xmath12 symmetry , these mps s have well - defined protected and junk spaces , with component matrices @xmath57 , and @xmath58 the pauli - type operators @xmath59 form a triad defined by @xmath60 for @xmath61 respectively . a numerical calculation of the gate fidelity , order parameter , and relevant length scales of states throughout the parameter space is shown in figure  [ fig : six_plots ] . </S>",
    "<S> we can see that the rg flow induced by @xmath10-buffering improves the gate fidelity of a @xmath32 rotation , an illustration by the `` most non - pauli '' @xmath10-axis rotation , almost everywhere in our toy model . </S>",
    "<S> the points at which the gate fidelity is not improved are precisely those with divergent @xmath38 , in agreement with theorem  [ thm : zb ] . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we see remarkable similarity between the plots showing gate fidelity and those showing @xmath46 in figure  [ fig : six_plots ] , both of which improve as the degree of @xmath10-buffering is increased . after sufficient renormalization ( i.e. , at @xmath62 ) </S>",
    "<S> , the gate fidelity achieves its maximum value precisely when @xmath63 , as stated in theorem  [ thm : gf ] .    </S>",
    "<S> there are a few singular states in our parameter space with regard to their behavior under renormalization . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in figure  [ fig : six_plots ] , the region with @xmath64 and any @xmath53 , as well as the poles at @xmath65 , have divergent @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood by noticing that @xmath42 is unitary at these points , so that @xmath10-buffering just acts as a change of basis on the junk space . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the original correlation length @xmath5 , does not diverge at @xmath64 , so that this is a new kind of singular state only detected by our operationally motivated classification of quantum many - body states . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , states at the poles ( @xmath65 ) are not within the @xmath33 spto phase , because the original mps s are long - range correlated , having a divergent @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> there is another singular state at @xmath66 , whose pathological behavior is discussed in appendix  c.    _ conclusion. _ we proved two theorems to demonstrate the intrinsic , quantum computational usefulness of the 1d @xmath33 spto phase as a `` universal '' quantum channel . we think that our physically feasible renormalization procedure , called @xmath10-buffering , is interesting on its own , because our state - insensitive protocol indicates that it is possible to harness such intrinsic capability of the phase without knowledge of microscopic details , at least as long as the states are guaranteed to be in the phase . as an outlook , </S>",
    "<S> since it is plausible that resource states for universal computation should generally possess such universal - channel capability in two or higher dimensions , our work is expected to serve as a stepping stone in the search for universal resource states in naturally - occurring quantum many - body systems .    </S>",
