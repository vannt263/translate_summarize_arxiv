    "<S> a spectral principal component analysis ( spca ) of a sample of 87 pg qsos at @xmath0 is presented for their mid - infrared spectra from spitzer space telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we have derived the first five eigenspectra , which account for 85.2% of the mid - infrared spectral variation . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the first eigenspectrum represents the mid - infrared slope , forbidden emission line strength and @xmath1 silicate feature ; the 3rd and 4th eigenspectra represent the silicate features at @xmath2 and @xmath1 , respectively . with the principal components ( pc ) from optical pca , we find that there is a medium strong correlation between spectral spc1 and pc2 ( accretion rate ) . </S>",
    "<S> it suggests that more nuclear contribution to the near - ir spectrum leads to the change of mid - ir slope . </S>",
    "<S> we find mid - ir forbidden lines are suppressed with higher accretion rate . </S>",
    "<S> a medium strong correlation between spc3 and pc1 ( eddington ratio ) suggests a connection between the silicate feature at @xmath3 and the eddington ratio . for the ratio of the silicate strength at 9.7 @xmath4 to that at 18 @xmath4 </S>",
