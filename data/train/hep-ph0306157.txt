    "effective field theories of qcd have provided efficient ways to explore hadron dynamics in those regimes where we are not able to solve the full theory . built from the same principles and symmetries which govern qcd ,",
    "the effective actions put at our disposal a model - independent framework to generate the interactions between the active degrees of freedom . in the very low - energy domain , chiral perturbation theory @xcite has achieved a remarkable success in describing the strong interactions among pseudoscalar mesons . moving up to the 1 gev region has been proved more difficult , as the effects of vector resonances become dominant and must be accommodated in the theory .",
    "several works @xcite have provided a sound procedure to include resonance states within the chiral framework , later christened resonance chiral theory .",
    "this approach , however , leaves the couplings entering the effective lagrangian unknown , as they are not fixed by the symmetry alone .",
    "one should then rely on the phenomenology or , alternatively , construct theoretical tools that could provide a meaningful way to compare the results of the effective theory with those of qcd . the pioneering work of ref .",
    "@xcite indicated that the analysis of green s functions and form factors of qcd currents yields valuable information on the resonance sector and , at the same time , clarifies the ambiguities related to the choice of the lorentz group representation for the resonance fields .",
    "recently , several authors have pushed forward this direction , either by using a lagrangian with explicit resonance degrees of freedom @xcite , or within the framework of the lowest meson dominance ( lmd ) approximation to the large number of colours ( @xmath6 ) limit of qcd @xcite . in particular , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite undertook a systematic study of several qcd three - point functions which share the property of being zero in absence of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking for massless quarks .",
    "this common feature means that these green s functions are free of perturbative contributions from qcd at short distances .",
    "therefore , their ope expansion , although formally applicable in the high - energy region , should be more reliable when descending to energies close to the resonance region , thus supporting the idea that a smooth matching between qcd and the effective description involving resonances may exist for these functions . under this hypothesis ,",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that while the ansatz derived from the lmd approach automatically incorporates the right short - distance behaviour of qcd by construction , the same green s functions as calculated with a resonance lagrangian , in the vector - field representation , are incompatible with the ope outcome .",
    "thus , the @xmath2 low - energy constants they extract from the resonance lagrangian differ from the estimates of the lmd ansatz .",
    "moreover the authors put forward that these discrepancies can not be repaired just by introducing local counterterms from the chiral lagrangian @xmath7 , as it was done at @xmath8 in ref .",
    "new terms with resonance fields and higher - order derivatives need to be added , at least in the vector - field representation , but the general procedure remains unknown .",
    "the result above severely questions the usefulness of the resonance effective theory beyond the initial work of ref .",
    "@xcite , that rely not only on the qcd global symmetries but also on the fact that its large@xmath6 limit resembles , at least qualitatively , the three colour theory @xcite .",
    "in addition one of the basic tenets , after the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite , is that meson physics in the large@xmath6 limit is described by the tree diagrams of an effective local lagrangian , with local vertices and local meson fields . hence after the qualm put forward by ref .",

    ", we have reanalysed one of the green s function studied in this last reference , the vector - vector - pseudoscalar three - point function , this time with the vector mesons described in terms of antisymmetric tensor fields .",

    "@xcite , where vector resonances were described in the proca formalism , the expression for the @xmath9 green s function obtained from the lagrangian with antisymmetric tensor fields is fully compatible with the short  distance qcd constraints , which reduce it to the ansatz suggested by lmd in the large-@xmath6 limit of qcd , successfully tested in previous works @xcite .",
    "* on the way , we have found that the same combinations of couplings which appears in the short - distance qcd constraints , show up in the @xmath107 amplitude calculated with the resonance lagrangian , thus allowing us to give a full prediction for this decay .",
    "the agreement with the experimental value is remarkable . *",
    "the @xmath107 calculation above shows an important feature : the contribution from a direct @xmath164 vertex is larger than expected from vmd .",
    "indeed , it amounts to more than 50@xmath160 of the total result for this amplitude .",
    "this agrees with the expectations from the @xmath0 counting , as both mechanisms contribute to the same order . *",

    "clearly , these terms do not belong to our vvp sector .    for the vjp interactions , basically the same considerations made above hold , and the substitution of one of the resonance fields @xmath183 by and external vector field @xmath184 , which has the same properties under @xmath47 and @xmath48 transformations , gives the allowed vjp structures .",
    "note that for each vvp term two vjp operators emerge with this procedure ( except for the term with @xmath185 ) , as the vector tensors are not equal now .",
