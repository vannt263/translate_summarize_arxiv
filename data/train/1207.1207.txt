    "color coherence effects in vacuum are found by tasso and opal experiments @xcite , by the depletion of particle spectrum for small energies .",
    "medium - induced soft gluon radiation off a single quark in the final state was also considered long ago @xcite .",
    "our goal is to check the color coherence effects between initial and final states in the presence of a medium which could be of applicability in dis on nucleus .",
    "it is a setup complementary to the antenna in the @xmath0-channel @xcite . in high energy dis the virtual photon scatters on one quark inside the nucleus to change its transverse momentum , and",
    "then such quark can rescatter on the fields generated by the other components of the nucleus .",
    "the process we consider is just a first step in studying ea collisions , which will be studied in the future lhec and eic colliders .",
    "when the scattering angle between the incoming and outgoing quarks becomes 0 , our calculation matches the one for gluon production in the totally coherent limit in the cgc framework @xcite .",
    "antenna radiation in @xmath1-channel in vacuum is shown in fig.[fig : vacuum ] .",
    "we work in the infinite momentum frame .",
    "small scattering angle between incoming and outgoing quarks ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively ) is assumed , i.e. @xmath4 . the eikonal approximation is employed , i.e. @xmath5 , where the relation between the forward light - cone momentum and the energy of the emitted soft gluon reads @xmath6 . the light - cone gauge @xmath7 is chosen , with the axial vector @xmath8 .",
    "a virtual photon @xmath9 with transverse size @xmath10 is absorbed by an incoming quark .",
    "the soft gluon spectrum off the incoming quark in vacuum in which the azimuthal angle is integrated with respect to the direction of quark ( analogously for the outgoing quark ) reads @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the strong coupling constant , @xmath13 is the casimir factor of the fundamental representation , @xmath14 is the gluon emission angle , and the heaviside step function gives the angular constraint @xmath15 , i.e. the soft gluon emission is constrained to be inside the cone set by the scattering angle between the incoming and outgoing quarks @xcite .",
    "as long as @xmath16 , the transverse wave length of the emitted gluon , is shorter than @xmath17 ( the change of position of the quark in the transverse plane due to the photon scattering when the gluon is formed . ] ) , the gluon resolves the color structure and the bremsstrahlung is therefore off either the incoming quark or the outgoing quark . in terms of angles ,",
    "one gets immediately @xmath15 from the simple analysis above .",
    "medium - induced antenna radiation in @xmath1-channel is shown in fig.[fig : medium ] .",
    "we work in the same setup as the one in vacuum .",
    "medium is assumed to act right after the photon scattering .",
    "note that there is no need to go into the details of how the medium is modeled in our study .",
    "we consider dilute medium scenario , i.e. one gluon exchange .",
    "the opacity is defined as @xmath18 , and when we say `` opacity expansion '' , we mean the expansion in number of scatterings .",
    "hadronization is considered to occur outside the medium , therefore the process we consider is a pure perturbative one .",
    "the medium - induced antenna spectrum in @xmath1-channel at 1st order in opacity expansion reads : @xmath19)\\\\ & \\ , + \\frac{2}{x\\,\\bar{x}}\\,\\biggl(\\frac{\\kh\\cdot\\khb}{(\\hk)\\,(\\pk)}\\,-\\frac{\\qh\\cdot\\khb}{(\\hk)\\,(\\pv)}\\\\ & \\ , + \\bigl(\\frac{\\qh\\cdot\\khb}{(\\hk)\\,(\\pv)}-\\,\\frac{\\qh\\cdot\\qhb}{(\\hv)\\,(\\pv)}\\bigr)\\,\\bigl(1-\\cos\\bigl[\\oh\\x+\\bigr])\\biggr)\\biggr ] , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 denotes the medium transport coefficient and @xmath21 is the inverse of the gluon formation length .",
    "the second line in eq.([eq : total_spectrum ] ) is the contribution from the gluon radiation off the initial quark .",
    "the third line in eq.([eq : total_spectrum ] ) comes from the medium - induced gluon radiation off the outgoing quark , i.e. the independent spectrum @xcite .",
    "the last two lines of eq.([eq : total_spectrum ] ) is the interference between the incoming and outgoing quarks .",
    "note that when the scattering angle @xmath22 , the spectrum becomes was studied in the multiple soft scattering approach in @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath23 where @xmath24 is the transverse component of the lipatov vertex in the light - cone gauge .",
    "the notations are @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "the structure of the transverse component of the gauge invariant lipatov vertex indicates that eq.([eq:0_scattering_angle ] ) is the genuine medium - induced gluon radiation off an on - shell quark which comes from the @xmath29 and goes to the @xmath30 .",
    "in the soft gluon emission limit ( @xmath31 ) , the antenna spectrum in @xmath1-channel in medium , adding the medium - induced and the vacuum contributions , reads @xmath32,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 at 1st order in opacity .",
    "the first term in the brackets shows the angular constraint for a reduced number of soft gluon emission off the incoming quark if one performs the azimuthal angle integration for the emitted soft gluon .",
    "the reason for the reduction of the soft gluon multiplicity inside the cone is that , the emitted soft gluon off the incoming quark will suffer rescattering when it goes through the medium .",
    "it therefore slows down the evolution of the gluon density .",
    "the rest in the brackets is the soft gluon emission off the outgoing quark in medium . when the medium is switched off , i.e. @xmath34 , one naturally gets the vacuum contribution . in the opaque medium limit ,",
    "i.e. @xmath35 , one has @xmath36 after comparing eq.([eq : opaque_medium ] ) with eq.([eq : soft_limit ] ) , one can see that the soft part of the medium - induced gluon energy spectrum off the incoming quark is suppressed , i.e. the gluon density is saturated , and the bremsstralung contribution between vacuum and medium - induced parts get canceled with each other . in eq.([eq : opaque_medium ] ) , one gets complete color decoherence for the outgoing quark , i.e. in the opaque medium the outgoing quark loses the color coherence with the incoming quark , and then the soft gluon radiation off the outgoing quark is like the soft gluon radiation off a single quark in vacuum .",
    "a similar property was discovered in the antenna spectrum in @xmath0-channel @xcite .",
