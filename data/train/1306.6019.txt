    "the structure of scattering amplitudes in both gauge and gravity theories continues to attract significant attention , due to a wide variety of phenomenological and formal applications . although superficially very different from each other , there is mounting evidence that gauge and gravity theories may be related to each other in intriguing ways .",
    "such developments motivate the need to study aspects of amplitudes in a variety of theories using a common language , and to compare and contrast phenomena in gauge theories with their gravitational counterparts . + this paper studies one such phenomenon , that of four - point scattering of massive ( and massless ) particles in the so - called _ regge limit _",

    "an interesting feature is that high energy scattering in gravity is dominated by long - distance rather than short - distance behavior , a fact which is ultimately traceable to the dimensionality of the gravitational coupling constant , and the masslessness of the graviton .",
    "the lack , or otherwise , of ultraviolet renormalizability ceases to be problematic in this limit , and one may show that the long - distance behavior is insensitive to the amount of supersymmetry . however , some confusion remained in ref .",

    "the soft limit of gravity was first considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , and has recently been more extensively studied in refs .",
    "the latter papers seek to cast the gravitational behavior in terms of contemporary gauge theory language , and thus to expose common physics in the soft limits of both theories .",
    "this includes the introduction of wilson line operators for soft graviton emission  @xcite , whose vacuum expectation values give rise to a gravitational _ soft function _ , the uv singularities of which correspond to the ir singularities of a scattering amplitude . as in qcd , this function exponentiates .",
    "unlike qcd , however , the gravitational soft function has the special property of being _",

    "+ the aim of this paper is to examine the regge limit of ( super-)gravity using wilson lines , using a similar approach to the qed / qcd case of refs .",
    "there are a number of motivations for doing so .",
    "first , the analysis presents an interesting application of the gravitational wilson line operators of refs .",
    "second , the calculation provides a common language for reggeization in both gauge and gravity theories , which is particularly elegant in revealing common features of the two cases ( such as the appearance of relevant quadratic casimir operators in regge trajectories ) .",
    "third , the wilson line calculation ties together a number of previous results in gravity in a particularly transparent fashion , and helps to clarify some of the confusions inherent in the existing literature ( such as the interplay between the eikonal phase and reggeization of the graviton ) .",

    "unless otherwise stated , we will consider the scattering of massive particles , where for convenience we assume a common mass @xmath22 .",

    "the leading high energy behavior ( corresponding to leading logarithms in rapidity ) is given by the first term in the exponent acting on the hard function , and produces a tower of reggeized gluon exchanges , each dressed by the appropriate quadratic casimir .",
    "the analysis is in fact more general than this - even if the struts of the ladder have different exchanges , each will reggeize separately given that the @xmath9-channel operators for different struts commute with each other  @xcite .",
    "note that an eikonal phase term remains present , weighted as in the @xmath197 case by the quadratic casimir operator for @xmath69-channel exchanges .",
    "this has the same physical meaning in the present context - it is associated with the formation of @xmath69-channel bound states .",

    "the former is now itself a series of terms , each of which reggeizes the graviton in a given strut of the ladder .",
    "however , as in the @xmath197 case , the reggeization term in gravity involves the squared momentum transfer by virtue of its being the appropriate quadratic casimir , and thus is kinematically subleading in the strict regge limit of @xmath222 .",
    "thus , multigraviton scattering for any number of gravitons is dominated by the eikonal phase term , hinting at the production of bound states in the @xmath69-channel .",
    "+ it would be interesting to consider the impact of infrared finite corrections on this result . by analogy with the four point amplitude",
    ", one would expect additional logarithms to appear in the finite part , which disrupt the interpretation of graviton reggeization .",
    "it is worth noting here also that the regge limit of multiparticle scattering has been widely investigated in the context of the bds conjecture  @xcite , an all - order ansatz for the form of planar amplitudes in @xmath20 super - yang - mills theory .",

    "+ the wilson line approach reveals the presence of both an eikonal phase and a reggeization term in the soft function at one - loop , where the former is associated with the formation of @xmath69-channel bound states due to the perturbative part of the potential . in qcd , the reggeization term dominates at leading logarithmic order , leading to automatic reggeization of arbitrary @xmath9-channel exchanges , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the regge trajectory is purely infrared singular at one - loop order , and involves the quadratic casimir operator associated with a given @xmath9-channel exchange . beyond this logarithmic order",
    ", cross - talk occurs between the two contributions , leading to a breakdown of simple regge pole behavior .",
    "the situation is further complicated in qcd , even for the purely infrared singular parts of the amplitude , by the presence of corrections to the exponent of the soft function .",
    "+ our gravity calculation used the wilson line operators of refs .",
    "@xcite , and confirmed the presence of both an eikonal phase and reggeization term at one - loop in gravity . here",
    "the soft function is one - loop exact , receiving no perturbative corrections in the exponent  @xcite .",
    "the eikonal phase and regge trajectory , as expected from the qcd calculation , contain quadratic casimir operators associated with @xmath69- and @xmath9-channel exchanges . in the gravity case , these are the mandelstam invariants @xmath69 and @xmath9 themselves , and thus one finds a particularly elegant explanation for the fact that the gravitational regge trajectory is linear in @xmath9 , and thus kinematically - subleading in the regge limit with respect to the eikonal phase @xmath128 .",
    "we saw that cross - talk between the two contributions leads to regge cut behavior , clarifying the qcd discussion of refs .",
    "we also examined reggeization in multigraviton scattering , finding again that graviton reggeization is sub - dominant with respect to the eikonal phase .",
    "+ the story of reggeization in gravity is further complicated , even at one - loop order , by the presence of ir - finite @xmath223 contributions .",
    "such double - log terms arise in explicit one - loop calculations in @xmath224 , @xmath225 , and @xmath226 supergravity @xcite .",
    "although these terms are kinematically - suppressed with respect to the eikonal phase term , they are of the same order as the reggeization term and therefore mix with the reggeization of the graviton .",
    "+ using known results for the two - loop amplitude in in @xmath227 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 , and @xmath226 supergravity , we computed the regge limit of the two - loop contribution to the logarithm of the amplitude , which measures the failure of the one - loop result to exponentiate .",
    "these correction terms are of @xmath228 and therefore kinematically - subleading with respect to the @xmath131 exponentiation of the eikonal phase ( and hence vanish in the strict regge limit ) .",
    "they are , however , kinematically - superleading with respect to the @xmath229 exponentiation of the one - loop reggeization term and also with respect to the @xmath230 terms computed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "+ although the strict regge limit of the two - loop amplitude was shown to be one - loop - exact for @xmath231 supergravity , it remains an open question whether this continues to hold at three loops and beyond , i.e. whether the strict regge limit of the @xmath198-loop result is given by the exponential of the one - loop eikonal phase .",
    "the resolution of this question awaits the evaluation of the contributing non - planar integrals .",
    "+ it is fair to say that the higher - loop contributions to the regge limit of gravity are still not fully understood . investigation of these contributions in more detail may shed light on a number of unresolved issues in quantum gravity , including issues of black hole formation and unitarity ( see e.g. refs .",
