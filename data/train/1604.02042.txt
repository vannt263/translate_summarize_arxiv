    "since the birth of statistical mechanics , it has been recognised that the logarithm of the volume of phase space enclosed by the constant energy surface of a classical thermally isolated systems ( the so called volume entropy ) , is a good expression for its thermodynamic entropy .",
    "the mathematical and physical foundation of the volume entropy have been addressed various times in the history of statistical physics @xcite and is currently the object of further investigation @xcite .",
    "one property of the volume entropy that matches the corresponding property of thermodynamic entropy is that , when the adiabatic theorem holds , it remains constant in time @xcite .",
    "the question then naturally arises of what happens to the volume entropy when the adiabatic theorem does not hold , e.g. , if the timescale of variation of @xmath0 is not slow compared to the timescales in the system .",
    "is it increasing as one expects for the thermodynamic entropy ?",
    "a positive answer to this question has been given in @xcite in a statistical sense .",
    "if the initial state is sampled randomly from a passive distribution [ i.e. , a distribution of the form @xmath1 , with @xmath2 a monotonic decreasing function , and @xmath3 the hamiltonian at initial time ] , then the statistical expectation of the volume entropy at a time @xmath4 is larger than its initial expectation value .",
    "a second question that arises regards how to extend the notion of volume entropy to the quantum case .",
    "the answer is not unique and at least two proposals exist in the literature .",
    "one proposal defines the quantum counterpart of the phase space volume as @xmath5 $ ] @xcite .",
    "the other defines a `` number operator '' as that operator whose eigenvectors are the hamiltonian eigenvectors @xmath6 and whose eigenvalues are the corresponding labels @xmath7 , that order the the eigen - energies in increasing fashion @xmath8 .",
    "the `` volume entropy operator '' is then the logarithm of the `` number operator''@xcite .",
    "an advantage of the latter definition is that it allows for a generalisation of the classical results mentioned above .",
    "a drawback is that it applies to systems with non - degenerate spectra only , thus excluding interesting physical scenarios , e.g. the joining of two identical systems @xcite , or their disjoining .",
    "the purpose of this work is accordingly to extend the notion of `` volume entropy operator '' to possibly degenerate spectra and to investigate its behaviour under a generic , non - necessarily adiabatic , quantum evolution .",
    "we consider the entropy associated to a thermally isolated classical hamiltonian system , with a parameter ( @xmath0 ) dependent hamiltonian @xmath9 in the expression given by gibbs @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the measure of the portion @xmath12 of phase space @xmath13 which at fixed parameter @xmath0 has energy below @xmath14 : @xmath15 , @xcite .",
    "as mentioned it is an adiabatic invariant @xcite , and when the adiabatic theorem is not satisfies , on average it can not decrease if the initial state is sampled randomly from a classical passive distribution [ i.e. , a distribution of the form @xmath16 , with @xmath2 a monotonic decreasing function , here @xmath17 is the value taken by @xmath0 at time @xmath18 .",
    "an analogous result has been proven for quantum mechanical systems with non - degenerate spectrum in @xcite .",
    "the quantum mechanical treatment requires the introduction of a quantum mechanical counterpart of the classical volume @xmath19 .",
    "one possible choice is to consider the operator @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the dimension of the hilbert space , @xmath22 denote the eigenvectors of the @xmath0-dependent hamilton operator @xmath23 the spectrum is assumed to be non degenerate for all @xmath0 s , and the eigenvalues are ordered in an increasing fashion : @xmath24 accordingly , the expectation of the `` number operator '' @xmath25 on an energy eigenstate @xmath22 gives the ordering label @xmath26 , saying how many eigenstates exist with energy not above @xmath27 .",
    "this is in analogy with the quantity @xmath28 roughly saying how many shells of some unit measure @xmath29 exist at some fixed @xmath0 below the shell of energy @xmath14 .",
    "one defines accordingly the entropy operator as follows @xmath30 consider now the case when @xmath0 changes in time according to a time dependent protocol @xmath31 & \\rightarrow   \\mathbb r \\nonumber \\\\ t & \\mapsto \\lambda_t\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the time dependent hamiltonian @xmath32 generates a unitary evolution @xmath33 according to the schrdinger equation @xmath34 consider an initial state @xmath35 and its evolved @xmath36 , and consider the expectation of the volume entropy operator at time @xmath37 @xmath38 the following has been proven @xcite :    [ theo : theo1 ] let @xmath39 for @xmath40 and all times @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "if there exist a probability distribution @xmath42 such that @xmath43 for @xmath40 and @xmath44 then @xmath45    the proof is based on the following @xcite    [ lem : lem1 ] let @xmath46 , @xmath47 , be two probability distributions .",
    "let @xmath48 for @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath49 be a non - decreasing real sequence . if there exists a doubly stochastic matrix @xmath50 with elements @xmath51 such that @xmath52 , then @xmath53    the thesis of theorem [ theo : theo1 ] follows by writing @xmath54 and @xmath55 and by noticing that the population @xmath56 of state @xmath57 at time @xmath58 is linked to the initial population @xmath59 by the expression @xmath60 where the quantum mechanical transition probabilities @xmath61 form a doubly stochastic matrix .",
    "note that the non - degeneracy condition @xmath62 implies that no level crossing occurs during the dynamics .",
    "this implies that under the further condition of a slow driving the quantum adiabatic theorem @xcite applies . in that case",
    "the inequality ( [ eq : theo1 ] ) turns into an equality .    in case",
    "the spectrum has possibly some degeneracies at a given @xmath0 we order the eigenenergies in a non - decreasing fashion @xmath63 note the @xmath64 sign , accounting for the possibility that two or more states have the same energy .",
    "let @xmath65 be the set of all indices such that for a given @xmath0 the corresponding energy is equal to @xmath66 .",
    "let @xmath67 , be its cardinality , namely the degree of degeneracy of the energy eigenvalue @xmath66 .",
    "let @xmath68 be accordingly the number of states with energy not above @xmath66 . in analogy with the non - degenerate case one can define the `` number operator '' as @xmath69 and the entropy operator as @xmath70 . from the physical point of view",
    "the latter definition would however present a problem .",
    "imagine the system is at equilibrium in a statistical mixture @xmath71 at some fixed @xmath0 where same energy states are equally populated : @xmath72 if @xmath73 .",
    "imagine all states are non - degenerate apart from states @xmath74 , which are doubly degenerate .",
    "it is @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "imagine now that an infinitesimal perturbation @xmath77 lifts the degeneracy , so that we have the new numbers @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "while the populations @xmath59 and @xmath80 would be affected at most by terms of @xmath81 , the expectation of @xmath82 would change by the finite amount @xmath83+o(\\epsilon)$ ] .",
    "we regard such finite jump associated to an arbitrarily small perturbation as unphysical .",
    "a definition of `` volume entropy operator '' that does not suffer from the degeneracy - lift issue is the following : @xmath84 where @xmath85^{\\frac{1}{g_k(\\lambda ) } } \\label{eq : n - deg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the geometric average of @xmath86 over the set @xmath87 .",
    "accordingly @xmath88 is the arithmetic average of @xmath89 over the set @xmath87 .",
    "note that in the case of a non - degenerate spectrum it is @xmath90 and one recovers the definition in eq .",
    "( [ eq : s - non - deg ] ) . with the definitions in ( [ eq : s - deg],[eq : n - deg ] ) we can state the following    [ theo : theo2 ] let @xmath91 for @xmath40 and all times @xmath41 $ ] . if there exist a probability distribution @xmath42 such that @xmath92 , @xmath93 for @xmath40 and @xmath44 then @xmath94    * proof .",
    "* we first prove the thesis by assuming that at time @xmath95 the spectrum is non - degenerate , i.e. @xmath96 .",
    "it is @xmath97 . due to the assumption",
    "@xmath98 it is @xmath99 . on the other hand @xmath100 . since @xmath60 with @xmath101 forming a doubly stochastic matrix the thesis follows from lemma [ lem : lem1 ] .    let us now consider the case when the spectrum at time @xmath95 possibly have degeneracies .",
    "let us imagine for illustrative proposes that all states are non - degenerate apart from states @xmath102 , which are doubly degenerate .",
    "their contribution to @xmath103 is @xmath104 $ ] .",
    "we can re - express that as @xmath105 , where @xmath106 .",
    "more generally , in case of many degenerate subspaces of arbitrary dimension , by introducing the new probabilities @xmath107 the final entropy expectation reads @xmath108 .",
    "it now remains to be demonstrated that the @xmath109 are linked to the @xmath59 by a doubly stochastic matrix .    using vector notation @xmath110 , @xmath111 .",
    "it is @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a block diagonal matrix whose blocks are of the form @xmath114 with @xmath115 the dimension of the block . in @xmath113 the various blocks have the dimension of the corresponding degenerate subspaces .",
    "each block is doubly stochastic ( the sum of the elements in any row or column is @xmath116 ) , and so is the matrix @xmath113 itself .",

    "since both @xmath113 and @xmath117 are doubly stochastic , so is their product @xmath122 that is @xmath123 where @xmath124 are the elements of the doubly stochastic matrix @xmath125 .",
    "the thesis then follows from lemma [ lem : lem1 ] .",
    "as an example we consider the sudden breaking of a xx spin chain of length @xmath21 into two identical xx spin chains of length @xmath126 .",
