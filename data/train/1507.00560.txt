    "<S> introduction . </S>",
    "<S> _ the two - dimensional hubbard model is a prototype system for competing order in layered transition metal oxide compounds . shortly after the discovery of high temperature superconductivity in cuprates </S>",
    "<S> , it has been proposed as a key model describing the valence electrons in the copper - oxygen planes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the model exhibits the most prominent ordering phenomena observed in high-@xmath1 cuprates , namely antiferromagnetism and @xmath0-wave superconductivity @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> while the magnetic order is captured already by conventional mean - field theory @xcite , superconductivity is fluctuation - driven and hence more subtle . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the emergence of @xmath0-wave superconductivity in the 2d hubbard model is nowadays well established @xcite . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> unbiased evidence for superconductivity with sizable gaps at moderate interaction strengths has been obtained from functional renormalization group ( frg ) calculations @xcite , and from embedded quantum cluster methods at intermediate and strong coupling @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic order is not necessarily of commensurate nel type , that is , with antiparallel spin orientation between adjacent sites . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of magnetic order with generally _ incommensurate _ wave vectors away from @xmath2 has been explored by several mean - field studies @xcite , and also by expansions in the limit of a small hole density , where fluctuation effects were taken into account @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> incommensurate magnetic order in the two - dimensional hubbard model is also indicated by diverging interactions and susceptibilities at incommensurate momenta in frg flows @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the competition and possible coexistence of incommensurate magnetism and superconductivity has not yet been analyzed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to do this , one needs to access the ordered phase in a framework that captures the fluctuations which generate @xmath0-wave superconductivity , allowing at the same time for a high momentum space resolution to distinguish the incommensurate ordering wave vector from @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter requirement is an obstacle for cluster methods , which have so far been restricted to commensurate antiferromagnetism @xcite .    in the frg flow spontaneous symmetry breaking </S>",
    "<S> is signaled by diverging effective interactions at a critical energy scale @xmath3 . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , the flow can be continued below the instability scale @xmath3 to compute order parameters in the ordered phase @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . however , this is rather complicated , especially in case of two or more order parameters . </S>",
    "<S> a drastic simplification occurs if the flow below the scale @xmath3 is approximated by mean - field theory ( mft ) , since then order parameters can be computed without dealing with anomalous interactions @xcite . while fluctuations above @xmath3 are crucial for the generation of @xmath0-wave superconductivity , fluctuations below @xmath3 are not expected to affect ground state order parameters significantly . </S>",
    "<S> recently , a consistent fusion of the frg flow above the scale @xmath3 with mft below @xmath3 has been formulated and used to study the competition of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in the hubbard model @xcite . in the purely superconducting regime of the ground state phase diagram , </S>",
    "<S> the pairing gap computed by frg+mft could be compared to previous results from a complete frg flow with symmetry breaking ( including fluctuations below @xmath3 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained from the two methods agree very well . </S>",
    "<S> away from half - filling , antiferromagnetic order was shown to be accompanied by microscopically coexisting @xmath0-wave superconductivity , in qualitative agreement with results from a previous frg+mft computation @xcite and from cluster methods at stronger interactions @xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> we present novel results for the two - dimensional hubbard model , allowing , for the first time , magnetic order with arbitrary wave vectors and superconductivity . </S>",

    "<S> _ our results are based on the frg+mft method formulated in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> the calculation consists of three steps . </S>",
    "<S> first , the two - particle vertex is computed from a frg flow integrated down to a scale @xmath4 slightly above the critical scale @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the flow is approximated by a one - loop truncation , with a static ( frequency independent ) vertex parametrized via a decomposition in charge , magnetic , and pairing channels @xcite with @xmath5-wave and @xmath0-wave form factors as described in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> spin - singlet pairing is driven by the singlet component of the vertex in the cooper channel ( zero total momentum ) , @xmath9 where @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic instabilities with a momentum @xmath11 are generated by the magnetic component of the vertex with momentum transfer @xmath11 , that is , @xmath12 note that @xmath13 due to spin rotation invariance .    in the second step , </S>",
    "<S> the _ irreducible _ vertices in the relevant channels are computed by solving the corresponding bethe - salpeter equations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the irreducible pairing vertex @xmath14 is obtained from the equation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the propagator at the scale @xmath4 , and @xmath17 is a short - hand notation for @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the irreducible magnetic vertex @xmath19 is determined from @xmath20 in this work we neglect self - energy contributions to the flow , so that @xmath21 is just the regularized bare propagator @xmath22 .    finally , </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting and magnetic order parameters are computed by solving the mean - field hamiltonian with the irreducible vertex parts @xmath14 and @xmath19 as effective interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting order parameter is given by the gap function @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the cooper pair annihilation operator . </S>",
    "<S> the phase of the superconducting order can be chosen such that @xmath25 is real . </S>",
    "<S> concerning the magnetic order , we restrict our analysis to spiral states , as described by the order parameter @xmath26 where @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath28 the spiral order is equivalent to nel order with a staggered magnetisation in the @xmath29-plane . </S>",
    "<S> there are several mean - field studies of spiral magnetic order in the two - dimensional hubbard model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a frequently discussed alternative is collinear order @xcite , especially in combination with pronounced charge stripes @xcite . in a spiral state </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the magnetization is homogeneous , only the orientation varies . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the magnetic order entails an energy gain everywhere in the system . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , collinear order necessarily involves regions with a reduced magnetization , where the energy gain from the order is also reduced . </S>",
    "<S> incommensurate collinear order is therefore expected to be favorable only in the form of sharply defined charged domain walls between antiferromagnetic regions @xcite . in the moderate interaction regime </S>",
    "<S> investigated here such pronounced real space profiles seem unfavorable since they cost a lot of kinetic ( hopping ) energy .    </S>",
    "<S> a mean - field decoupling of the reduced effective interactions yields the mean - field hamiltonian @xmath30 for the hubbard model with nearest and next - to - nearest neighbor hopping on a square lattice , the dispersion relation is @xmath31 . using nambu spinors </S>",
    "<S> @xmath32 , the mean - field hamiltonian can be written in the form @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a hermitian @xmath35 matrix . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath36 can thus be diagonalized by a @xmath35 unitary ( generalized bogoliubov ) transformation , and the resulting gap equations can be solved numerically by iteration . </S>",
    "<S> occasionally two distinct locally stable solutions of the gap equations are found . </S>",
    "<S> one then has to compute the corresponding free energies to discriminate globally stable from metastable states .    </S>",

    "<S> we now present our results for @xmath39 and @xmath38 , and subsequently discuss similarities and differences found for the other choices of @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xcite . in the following we set @xmath43 .    in fig .  1 we show the amplitudes of the magnetic and superconducting order parameters , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , as a function of the electron density .    , for @xmath46 and @xmath47 . </S>",

    "<S> the magnetic order is completely suppressed by superconductivity at van hove filling ( @xmath60 ) , but then reemerges for lower densities . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic transition at @xmath61 is of weak first - order type . </S>",
    "<S> the incommensurability @xmath62 is plotted as a function of the density in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> it jumps from zero to a small finite value at the commensurate - incommensurate transition , and then increases monotonically upon further doping until the magnetic order disappears at @xmath63 . </S>",

    "<S> 2 , exhibits a discontinuity due to the charge gap at half - filling . in other words , the density @xmath65 is pinned to half - filling for a range of chemical potentials between @xmath66 and @xmath67 .     and </S>",
    "<S> chemical potential @xmath68 as function of the density for the same parameters as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1.,width=294 ]    comparing to the purely magnetic solution ( excluding superconductivity ) , which is also shown in fig .  1 , one can see that superconductivity has little influence on the magnetic order in the regime around half - filling where it is commensurate . </S>",
    "<S> the incommensurate magnetic order on the hole - doped side is strongly suppressed by pairing in the vicinity of van hove filling . at van hove filling , superconductivity eliminates the magnetic order completely . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , in the overdoped regime well below van hove filling , incommensurate magnetic order and superconductivity coexist without suppressing each other significantly .    </S>",
    "<S> the pairing gap @xmath25 is finite for all densities except at half - filling , where the fermi surface is fully gapped by the antiferromagnetic order . </S>",
    "<S> hence , away from half - filling , magnetic order always allows for coexisting superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> this is easily understood as follows . </S>",
    "<S> doping the half - filled antiferromagnet by additional electrons or holes leads to electron or hole pockets ( see the insets of fig .  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ubiquitous attractive @xmath0-wave pairing interaction inevitably generates a cooper instability at the ( small ) fermi surfaces enclosing these pockets , and thus superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the hole pockets for @xmath54 are centered around the nodes of the pairing gap @xmath25 , while the electron pockets for @xmath52 are in the antinodal region near @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where the gap is maximal . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the onset of pairing around half - filling is much steeper on the electron doped side ( see fig .  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with recent spin - fluctuation exchange calculations in the weak coupling regime @xcite , but differs from the behavior found in a strong coupling analysis of electrons moving in an antiferromagnetic spin background . in the latter case , pairing is mediated mostly by _ transverse _ spin fluctuations ( magnons ) , which couple very weakly to electrons in the antinodal region , so that the pairing interaction is very small for low electron doping @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , at moderate coupling also _ longitudinal _ </S>",
    "<S> spin fluctuations contribute , and yield a sizable pairing interaction in the antinodal region @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the maximal gap amplitude at  optimal  hole - doping is significantly larger than the maximal gap on the electron doped side , in agreement with the gap hierarchy in cuprate superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> the maximal gap on the hole - doped side is situated slightly above van hove filling , where the magnetic order is already quite weak . </S>",
    "<S> the gap decreases smoothly in the  overdoped  regime , due to a decrease of the pairing interaction and the density of states .    </S>",
    "<S> the leading order parameter is often guessed from the leading divergence of the effective interactions in the frg flow upon approaching the critical scale @xmath3 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is usually correct , but there are exceptions . in particular , around van hove filling , </S>",
    "<S> we find superconductivity as the dominant order , although the leading divergence occurs actually in the magnetic channel ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite where the frg flow was studied for the same parameters ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a major novel result of our work is the coexistence of superconductivity with incommensurate magnetic order in a regime where a purely superconducting state was expected , since the hole - doping is already quite large . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore interesting to look at the condensation energy gained by symmetry breaking in the incommensurate regime . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 we plot the total condensation energy @xmath71 gained by magnetism and pairing .     and relative magnetic condensation energy @xmath72 as a function of the chemical potential @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the inset is a zoom into the region with incommsurate magnetic order . </S>",
    "<S> the model parameters are the same as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1.,width=264 ]    we also plot the additional energy gain due to the magnetic order compared to a purely superconducting state , @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the pairing gap in the absence of magnetism . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that this additional energy gain is tiny in the incommensurate regime ( @xmath74 ) , even for densities where the size of the magnetic order parameter is comparable to the pairing gap . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the magnetic order in this regime is extremely delicate , a kind of _ `` gossamer magnetism '' _ , reminiscent of laughlin s `` gossamer superconductivity '' in lightly doped mott insulators @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the quasi - degeneracy of a purely superconducting state and a state with coexisting magnetism can be expected to lead to intriguing fluctuation effects .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now compare the above results to those obtained for other choices of @xmath41 , as presented in our supplementary material @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath75 and @xmath47 , the ground state is purely superconducting for all densities , with a small @xmath0-wave gap which is maximal slightly above van hove filling . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic order occurs only if superconductivity is switched off . </S>",
    "<S> this is expected in the weak coupling limit in the absence of nesting ( for finite @xmath42 ) . for @xmath76 and @xmath47 </S>",
    "<S> there is no homogeneous solution in the density range @xmath77 , which includes also van hove filling . </S>",
    "<S> hence , a system with an average density in that interval will undergo phase separation in regions with distinct densities @xmath78 and @xmath79 , or form a more complex type of order . for smaller densities </S>",
    "<S> incommensurate magnetic order coexisting with @xmath0-wave superconductivity is found , again with a tiny energy gain from the magnetic order . </S>",
    "<S> hence , our main result , the coexistence of superconductivity with a very delicate incommensurate magnetic order at sizable hole - doping , is robust with respect to an increase of @xmath41 . on the electron - doped side , there are no qualitative differences compared to @xmath80 , except for a tiny incommensurate region at the edge of the magnetic regime .    for @xmath40 , </S>",
    "<S> the hubbard model is particle - hole symmetric , that is , the properties for densities @xmath65 and @xmath81 are equivalent . due to perfect nesting the system is a nel antiferromagnet at half - filling for any @xmath82 . there is no homogeneous solution in a density range around half - filling , both on the electron and hole - doped side . for larger </S>",
    "<S> doping there is a small region exhibiting incommensurate magnetism in coexistence with @xmath0-wave superconductivity , and a broader purely superconducting region . </S>",
    "<S> while the magnetic order parameter at half - filling has almost the same size for @xmath40 and @xmath83 , the largest achievable pairing gap ( at optimal doping ) is much smaller for @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> a sizable next - to - nearest neighbor hopping thus helps to promote superconductivity with a large gap . </S>",
    "<S> this was already revealed in a previous frg study @xcite and in a recent quantum cluster calculation @xcite , and is in qualitative agreement with the empirical trend in cuprates @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> superconductivity has larger maximal gaps and it coexists with incommensurate magnetism at moderate doping , except at van hove filling , where magnetic order is fully suppressed by pairing . </S>",
    "<S> the incommensurate magnetic order is `` gossamer - like '' in the sense that it is stabilized only by a tiny energy gain with respect to a purely superconducting state . </S>",
    "<S> rather fragile incommensurate magnetic order has actually been observed at the bottom of the superconducting dome in @xmath85 @xcite and @xmath86 @xcite . suppressing superconductivity by a strong magnetic field would stabilize that order . </S>",
