    "the dynamics of a simple pendulum for small amplitudes is probably the most widely used example by educators to illustrate simple harmonic motion : both the experiment and theory are accesible to college students .",
    "however the discussion of the large amplitude oscillations is rarely carried out , probably because there is no  simple \" analytical formula for the period . over the years",
    "several approximation schemes have been developed to discuss the large angle oscillations and in this paper we provide yet another .",
    "it turns out that the formula derived here , which is quite accurate even for very large amplitudes , was obtained a long time ago by ganley @xcite using a very different method .",
    "however , while the final result is the same , the derivation here is probably simpler and also directly linked to the usual derivation for the linearised pendulum .",
    "indeed , the interested reader could potentially use the presentation here as the starting point for a systematic improvement of the formula .",
    "furthermore , an important difference between the result of ganley and that obtained in this paper is mentioned at the end of the next section .",
    "the equation of motion for the simple pendulum can be derived by applying newton s second law to motion along the tangential direction of the arc , giving    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the length of the pendulum , @xmath2 the acceleration due to gravity and @xmath3 the angular displacemnent .",
    "the usual linearised approximation involves replacing @xmath4 by @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath5 , so that the period , @xmath6 , of a linear pendulum is @xmath7 , which up to a constant of proportionality is the unique expression obtained by dimensional analysis .",
    "indeed , by dimensional analysis the period of the non - linear pendulum must be of the form    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the amplitude of oscillations and @xmath10 a function to be determined . an approximate expression for @xmath10",
    "can be obtained by first rewriting the equation of motion in the suggestive form    @xmath11    if one could treat the term in brackets as a constant , as it approximately is for small angles , then an attempted estimate of the period of the non - linear pendulum would be @xmath12 .",
    "of course this formula does not make much sense as it stands since the period can not depend on the angular displacement : the varying @xmath3 should be replaced by some `` average '' value @xmath13 that depends on the amplitude @xmath9 .",
    "thus we obtain    @xmath14    perturbative solutions @xcite of the non - linear pendulum equation of motion give @xmath15 . comparing this with the perturbative expansion of the right - hand - side of eq.([try1 ] )",
    "implies    @xmath16    or @xmath17 .",
    "hence an first approximation for the period of a non - linear pendulum is    @xmath18    the quality of this approximation can be determined by comparing it to the exact value @xcite given by    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind .",
    "the two expressions @xmath21 and @xmath22 are plotted in figure(1 ) which shows that the approximation @xmath23 gives an accuracy of @xmath24 for amplitudes as large as @xmath25 radians .",
    "it should be noted that the approximation always lies below the exact answer , but unlike the exact answer it does not diverge at @xmath26 .",
    "while the same formula for the _ ratio _ @xmath21 was obtained by ganley in an interesting paper @xcite using different methods , the approach presented here gives @xmath23 explicitly and consequently in the limit of small angles the known expression @xmath6 is also recovered .",
    "perturbative solutions for @xmath10 are known ( or can be obtained by expansing the right - hand - side of ( [ ex ] ) ) . from the symmetry of the problem",
    ", one sees that only even powers of @xmath9 can appear .",
    "a natural question is :  how many terms of the series expansion must be kept to get a @xmath24 accuracy in the period for an amplitude @xmath25 ? \" ( that is , to compare with the approximate formula of the last section ) .",
    "a simple numerical exercise shows that all terms up to and including the eighth - order term must be taken into account .",
    "in a recent paper kidd and fogg @xcite motivated the approximation @xmath27 which provides a @xmath24 accuracy in the period for @xmath9 up to @xmath28 .",
    "though the expression of kidd and fogg is accurate over a smaller range of amplitudes than the expression @xmath23 , it shares one interesting feature with the exact expression : a divergence at @xmath29 .",
    "this suggests that one generalise the method of the last section by trying an _ ansatz _ for @xmath10 that also diverges at the extreme amplitude @xmath29 .",
    "one simple possibility , suggested by the form of eq.([rewrite ] ) is    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is a positive constant to be determined . by comparing the first nontrivial terms of the power - series of both sides of the last equation , one obtains @xmath32 .",
    "the resulting expression @xmath33 always exceeds the exact answer and has an accuracy of @xmath24 for amplitudes up to @xmath34 radians .",
    "interestingly , the result @xmath35 is precisely the expression of molina @xcite but obtained there with a slightly different motivation .",
    "the approach presented in sect.(2 ) may possibly be viewed as a kind of  adiabatic approximation \" and perhaps improved on to give successively better approximations .",
    "the main result ( [ res1 ] ) is relatively simple and accurate to very large amplitudes .",
    "while the _ ratio _ @xmath36 was previously obtained in @xcite using different arguments , here an explicit expression for @xmath23 has been obtained ."
