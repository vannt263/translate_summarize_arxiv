    "blueshifted absorption lines of highly ionized iron ( fexxv and/or fexxvi ) are observed in some active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "the large blueshift of the iron lines indicates the outflows blown away toward an observer with velocity of @xmath21@xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the speed of light .",
    "such high - velocity outflows , which are so - called ultra - fast outflows ( ufos ) , are detected in @xmath24 of seyfert galaxies , although the number of samples is not so large @xcite .",
    "the ufos are thought to be the disk winds , which are launched from the accretion disks around supermassive black holes , but the acceleration mechanism is still unknown . one plausible model is the line - driven wind model @xcite , in which the acceleration mechanism is radiation force due to spectral lines ( the absorbing the ultraviolet radiation through the bound - bound transition of metals ) . in this model , the line force becomes 101000 times larger than the radiation force due to thomson scattering near the disk surface where the ionization state is low @xcite , leading to the launch of the high - velocity disk winds . at the region far from the disk surface , since the wind matter is highly ionized by the x - ray irradiation from the disk corona , the blueshifted absorption lines of highly ionized iron lines are produced . the magnetically driven wind model ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , which is another theoretical model , can explain the large velocity of the outflowing matter , but this model requires an extra mechanism to adjust the ionization state of the wind matter to explain the absorption lines .",
    "radiation hydrodynamics simulations of the line - driven wind in agns have been developed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they clearly show that the line force accelerates the matter and the funnel - shaped disk wind appears for the typical parameters , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the black hole mass and eddington ratio of the disk luminosity respectively . in their simulations ,",

    ", @xcite and @xcite performed the spectral synthesis and revealed that the blueshifted absorption lines appear on the spectra transmitted through the line - driven disk winds .",
    "in addition , in our previous work ( * ? ? ?",

    "funnel - shaped disk winds appear , and dense matter is accelerated outward with an outflow velocity of @xmath32 and with an opening angle of @xmath33@xmath34 .",
    "the outward velocity , the column density , and the ionization state of the winds are consistent with those inferred from the x - ray observation of the ufos .",
    "the ufos could be statistically observed in about 1328% of the luminous agns ( @xmath35 ) , which is roughly comparable to the observed ratio ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "recently , @xcite ( hereafter g15 ) surveyed the wind properties for 20 samples of ufos in detail .",
    "they found that the mass outflow rate ( @xmath3 ) , momentum flux ( @xmath4 ) , and kinetic luminosity ( @xmath5 ) are scaling with agn bolometric luminosity ( @xmath7 ) as @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the line - driven disk wind model should explain this scaling relation if this wind is the origin of the ufos .",
    "however , the above scaling of the line - driven disk wind has not been investigated yet .    in this paper , by performing two - dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations of the line - driven disk winds , we research the dependence of the mass outflow rate , momentum flux , and kinetic luminosity on the disk luminosity ( that corresponds to the bolometric luminosity ) . in section [ method ] , we explain the calculation method , which is basically the same as n16 except for the slight modification .",

    "( [ eom1 ] ) and ( [ eom2 ] ) , the last term , @xmath57 , is the radiation force per unit mass including the line force , which is calculated as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the mass - scattering coefficient for free electrons , @xmath60 is the radiation flux via the disk emission , and @xmath61 is the force multiplier proposed by @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath62 is the radiation flux of the disk emission in a band of @xmath63@xmath64 , which largely contributes to the line force through the bound - bound transitions ( line - driving flux , see * ? ? ? * ) . in n16",

    "the line force would be estimated more precisely by the present method .",
    "we also modify the evaluation method of the velocity gradient when we estimate the force multiplier , @xmath61 .",

    ". the present method would be better than the previous method , since the light - ray along the direction of the line - driving flux effectively contributes the line force .",
    "for instance , around the wind base , the matter is accelerated almost perpendicularly to the disk plane via the @xmath28-component of the radiation force .",

    ". however , the distance from the equatorial plane to the @xmath52 plane , @xmath53 , is slightly modified .",

    "we note that the disk wind is slightly denser and faster than that of n16 .",
    "the maximum velocity is 1.52.0 times larger and the density is 1030 times larger than those of previous results .",
    "such changes are mainly caused by the modification of the treatment of the velocity gradient ( see section [ method ] ) . in the launching region , the matter is vertically accelerated by the @xmath89-component ( @xmath28-component ) of the radiation force .",
    "therefore , the velocity gradient along the direction of the radiation flux is larger than that along the radial direction .",

    "the mass ejection from the accretion disk reduces the mass accretion onto the black hole , and affects the disk luminosity as well as the effective temperature of the disk .",
    "then , the wind structure might change .",
    "however , the impact on the disk due to the launching of the wind is not considered in our simulations .",
    "we treat the emission and the density at the disk surface as not changing with time .",
    "our method might overestimate the mass outflow rate of the wind . in order to research the wind more realistically , it is important to perform the radiation hydrodynamics simulations in which the disk and wind are self - consistently solved .",
    "the numerical simulations of the near - eddington disks and outflows are performed by @xcite , but the line force is not included .",
    "the simulations taking into account the line force are remain future work .    in this paper , we calculate the mass accretion rate , momentum flux , and kinetic luminosity , and show that their scaling relations with disk luminosity are consistent with the results by g15",
    ". however , for more precise verification of the model , it is necessary to investigate the absorption lines of fexxv and/or fexxvi based on our simulation data .",
    "the spectral synthesis based on the results of simulations is important future work .",
    "the synthetic spectra calculated based on the results of @xcite have been reported by @xcite .",
    "recently , the time variation of the absorption lines is detected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this implies that the wind structure changes in time and/or the wind has a non - axisymmetrical structure .",
    "although the density fluctuations of line - driven wind in one- or two - dimensional calculations have been reported by @xcite , the non - axisymmetrical structure has not been investigated yet . to reveal the origin of the time variability of the absorption lines",
    ", we should perform time - dependent three - dimensional simulations .",
    "we performed two - dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations of line - driven disk winds in agns .",
    "the resulting scaling relations of the mass outflow rate ( @xmath6 ) , momentum flux ( @xmath8 ) , and kinetic luminosity ( @xmath9 ) with the disk luminosity are consistent with those obtained by x - ray observations ( g15 ) .",
    "we found @xmath199 , @xmath200 , and @xmath201 for the range of @xmath0 and @xmath1@xmath2 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 being the black hole mass and the eddington ratio . since the eddington ratio is limited within the narrow range of @xmath202@xmath2 for launching the winds , the above @xmath10-dependence can be replaced with the scaling relation with the bolometric luminosity ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ) .",
    "they are roughly consistent with the scaling relations obtained by the x - ray observations , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "at least , since there is large scatter in the ufo sample , our results are in the region containing 90% of the posterior probability distribution in the @xmath6-@xmath7 plane , @xmath8-@xmath7 plane , and @xmath9-@xmath7 plane ( g15 ) .",
    "our simulations also revealed that the line - driven winds do not appear for the agns with small eddington ratio , @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , in the case of @xmath203 , the black hole mass is limited to be @xmath204 for launching the winds .",
    "these results are also consistent with g15 .",
    "indeed , in g15 , the smallest eddington ratio in the ufo sample is @xmath205 , and their black hole masses are @xmath182 .",
    "there are no agns with @xmath206 exhibiting ufo features in the sample of g15 . in their sample , although ngc3227 has very small eddington ratio ( @xmath178 ) , the outflow velocity of this object is very small , @xmath207 , which is far from the ufos .",
    "the number of ufo samples is still small , but the line - driven disk winds successfully explain the scaling relations of the mass outflow rate , momentum flux , and the kinetic luminosity with agn luminosity . we conclude that the line - driven disk wind is a plausible model for ufos in agns .",
