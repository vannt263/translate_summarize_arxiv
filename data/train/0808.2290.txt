    "in recent years , doped manganese oxides remained at the forefront of theoretical and experimental research@xcite .",
    "the main source of interest in theses systems is the phenomenon of colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) , which they exhibit , and that is likely to have important technological applications . in the meantime ,",
    "the underlying basic physics remains elusive , and probably involves the strongly - correlated nature of the doped magnetic oxides .",
    "the cmr in doped manganates is observed for intermediate hole - doping levels , typically @xmath0 , in the temperature region around the transition between low - temperature metallic ferromagnetic ( fm ) and high - temperature insulating paramagnetic phases .",
    "in addition to double - exchange ferromagnetism@xcite , the cmr compounds also possess pronounced antiferromagnetic ( afm ) tendencies , as evident from the afm spin ordering with nel temperatures of about 100 - 200k , observed@xcite at the doping end - points ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) .",
    "this antiferromagnetism is of a superexchange origin@xcite .",
    "the manganates physics involves several degrees of freedom of substantially different nature , including localized core spins @xmath3 of mn ions , fermionic degrees of freedom associated with conduction @xmath4-electrons , lattice distortions , _",
    "etc_. in such systems , the presence of competing interactions ( such as fm and afm ) often gives rise to phase separation@xcite , whereby areas of different phases are stabilized in a structurally and stoichiometrically homogeneous sample . in the case of the manganates",
    ", it has even been suggested@xcite that phase separation into insulating paramagnetic and metallic fm phases may explain the resistivity peak observed near the curie temperature .",
    "in the present paper , we focus on the low - temperature regime where the presence of phase separation in the appropriate manganate systems has been directly verified , _",
    "e.g. , _ by means of scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) on thin films@xcite .",
    "transport measurements reveal metastability and history dependence near the percolation threshold ( @xmath5 ) , confirming phase separation in both film@xcite and crystalline@xcite samples .    using simple microscopic models@xcite it can readily be shown@xcite that the hole concentration @xmath6 indeed controls the balance between the fm and afm tendencies of the system . once @xmath6 is tuned away from the optimal cmr doping region , the homogeneous fm metallic state no longer corresponds to the energy minimum . instead , energy can be gained by changing the magnetic ordering , carrier density , bandstructure , and/or orbital state in _ part _ of the system , making the sample inhomogeneous@xcite .",
    "the surface tension between different phases@xcite then competes against the long - range interactions present in the system in the form of electrostatic forces@xcite or long - range crystal strain fields@xcite .",
    "these require that the system remains homogeneous at least _ on average _ on the appropriate length scale ( such as the debye",
    " hckel screening length ) , resulting in a periodic arrangement of nano- or mesoscopic regions of different phases@xcite .",
    "the geometry of the ensuing inhomogeneous ( phase separated ) state is at the focus of our present study .",
    "early studies of phase separation in double - exchange ",
    "superexchange systems@xcite implicitly assumed that the effects of the discrete lattice are unimportant , and consequently treated the problem within the continuum based , long - wavelength , approach . within this framework",
    ", the optimal phase separation geometry at small values of the fm volume ( or area ) fraction @xmath7 ( also the average magnetization per site ) is obviously that of spherical ( in two dimensions , circular ) fm droplets located at the sites of a packed hexagonal ( triangular ) super - lattice . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "only the three - dimensional case was treated in detail , with the implication that in two dimensions the situation is similar .",
    "when the system parameters are varied in such a way that @xmath7 increases beyond @xmath8 , the geometry changes to that of spherical afm droplets in an otherwise fm matrix .",
    "the change generally occurs via a direct `` geometrical phase transition''@xcite without any intervening regime characterized by both phases forming infinite connected shapes ( such as filaments and planar slabs in three dimensions or stripes in two dimensions)@xcite .",
    "this latter conclusion is important , since such slab or stripe arrangements , if realized , would have been characterized by peculiar and potentially useful properties such as history - dependent anisotropy of the ground state resistivity . however , the continuum treatment , which is at the basis of this result , is not valid beyond the region of very small values of @xmath9 .",
    "indeed , recent studies suggest@xcite that the boundary between the two phases is abrupt on the lattice - spacing scale ( _ i.e. , _ of the type commonly associated with ising spin systems ) . such a boundary can not be adequately described in the continuum limit , and its surface tension depends on its orientation with respect to the crystalline axes@xcite .",
    "this directional dependence of boundary energies should in turn affect the droplet shape ( generally favoring diamond - shaped droplets in two dimensions)@xcite , the arrangement of droplets in space , and ultimately the way the geometry of phase separation evolves with varying @xmath7 .",
    "this is apparently a generic property of electronic phase separation , found also within the frameworks of falikov ",
    "kimball@xcite and @xmath10 ( ref . )",
    "models .    in the present paper , we revisit the problem within the framework of a single - orbital double - exchange  superexchange hamiltonian ( with infinite hund s coupling @xmath11 ) , augmented by a long - range coulomb interaction term . using a variational hartree - fock approach , we compute the energies of various two - dimensional droplet and stripe phases corresponding to a fm area fraction @xmath12 , and determine the optimal configuration .",
    "our most important finding is that while a droplet lattice exists at low doping levels , a striped arrangement has a lower energy and is therefore stabilized over a broad region of the phase diagram . as anticipated from our previous results concerning the orientational dependence of the boundary energy@xcite , we find that diamond droplets and diagonal stripes are the preferred geometries for the fm regions of the inhomogeneous states .",
    "these conclusions gain further support from unrestricted hartree - fock calculations which we have carried out using monte - carlo simulated annealing on moderate size clusters .",
    "the simulations also demonstrate the existence of inhomogeneous states comprised of afm droplets ( or stripes ) embedded in a fm background ( @xmath13 ) , at higher doping levels .",
    "while our results pertain to the two - dimensional case , it is likely that qualitatively our conclusions would also apply to three - dimensional systems .",
    "specifically , we suggest that a phase separated state with filament or slab geometry ( rather than a lattice of droplets ) is realized for a certain range of parameters in three dimensions .    in addition",
    ", we find that the typical droplet size and stripe width do not exceed several lattice constants .",
    "this means that the motion of the charge carriers is strongly quantized , rendering droplets midway between metallic bulk and magnetic polarons@xcite and giving rise to singularities in the stripe energy associated with the quantisation of the transverse kinetic energy .",
    "this important property was not included in the earlier work@xcite , which assumed sufficiently large length scales for such quantum effects to be negligible .",
    "our approach , on the other hands , allows one to explore the crossover between the regime of singly - occupied magnetic polarons , which appear for strong coulomb and afm couplings , and the more conventional phase separation behavior where each metallic droplet is populated by many charge carriers .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the model and briefly review the physics underlying phase separation and magnetic polaron formation in the absence of a long - range force . a brief description of the calculational methods which were implemented in order to include the effects of the long - range coulomb repulsion appears in sec . [ sec : methods ] , while the mass of details is relegated to the appendices .",
    "[ sec : results ] contains a detailed description of our hartree  fock and monte - carlo results .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion of the results in the context of current experimental and theoretical work ( sec . [",
    "sec : conclu ] ) . while an arrangement of conducting and insulating stripes in doped manganate films has not yet been observed , we suggest that present experimental knowledge should allow for a meaningful and successful research effort in this direction .",
    "the starting point for the following calculation is the two - dimensional double - exchange hamiltonian , generalized to include the superexchange coupling and the long - range coulomb interaction , @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude and @xmath16 annihilates a conduction electron of spin @xmath17 at site @xmath18 of a square lattice .",
    "@xmath19 denotes the core spin made of three d - shell electrons ( @xmath20 ) localized at site @xmath21 , whose afm superexchange interaction with neighboring core spins is given by the second term in @xmath22 .",
    "the third term arises from hund s coupling between the core spins and the conduction electrons , where the spin operator for the conduction electrons on site @xmath21 involves the pauli matrices @xmath23 .",
    "it is this term , in conjunction with the fact that the hopping preserves the electronic spin , which gives rise to the double - exchange mechanism .",
    "this favors a fm spin configuration in order to reduce the conduction electrons kinetic energy@xcite .",
    "the last term includes the coulomb interaction among the conduction electrons , whose average density is @xmath6 , and a neutralizing uniform positive background , created by the donors .",
    "owing to the long - range nature of the coulomb interaction , the atomic - scale inhomogeneities of this background in real systems ( created by chemical substitution ) are not expected to be important from the point of view of our main purpose of comparing the energies of various inhomogeneous phases .",
    "this is because such energies always involve integration over volume .    in using the simplified model ,",
    "( [ eq : ham_orig ] ) , we neglect some additional physics characteristic of the cmr manganates@xcite .",
    "this includes the presence of two ( rather than one ) conduction electron @xmath4-bands and the electron - lattice coupling .",
    "the logics behind this simplification is summarized , _",
    "e.g. , _ in ref .",
    ": it is assumed that the mechanism for phase separation ( charge ordering ) is the competition between ferro- and antiferromagnetism in the presence of a long - range coulomb repulsion [ all contained in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham_orig ] ) ] .",
    "once the charge ordering is established , in a real system the orbital ordering ( and the lattice distortions ) would follow , leading to a quantitative renormalization of the parameter values . the model , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham_orig ] ) , is however expected to suffice for a qualitative study of the generic features of the phase diagram while its simplicity allows to maintain clarity of analysis .",
    "further arguments regarding the expected model - independence of our conclusions shall be given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclu ] .",
    "the relatively large value @xmath24 of the mn core spins means that their fluctuations are small , particularly in the @xmath25 limit considered here . in the following we assume @xmath26 and treat the core spins classically .",
    "consequently , the effective hamiltonian governing the physics of the conduction electrons is determined by the configuration of the classical spins @xmath27 .",
    "as far as the hund s coupling is concerned the manganates are characterized by a moderate bare @xmath28 .",
    "however , they also include a strong hubbard on - site repulsion , @xmath29 , which significantly renormalizes @xmath11 towards the strong coupling limit@xcite .",
    "therefore , while we omit the hubbard interaction from our hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham_orig ] ) , we model its effects by taking @xmath30 .    band theory calculations@xcite suggest that typical values of the hopping amplitude @xmath15 in the cmr manganates lie between 0.3 ev and 0.5 ev . the value of @xmath31 can be roughly estimated from the",
    "experimentally observed nel temperatures in the fully doped or undoped ( with no conduction @xmath4 electrons or with no holes ) case@xcite , @xmath32 , corresponding to @xmath33 .",
    "the long - range coulomb interaction strength , @xmath34 , for thin films is evaluated as @xmath35 . here ,",
    "@xmath36 is the electron charge and @xmath37   is the lattice spacing . the _ effective _ dielectric constant @xmath38 is given by the average of dielectric constant @xmath39 of the substrate and that of the air , @xmath40 .",
    "among the substances which can be used as substrates for manganate films , lanthanum aluminate and neodymium gallate have@xcite @xmath41 and @xmath42 , yielding @xmath43 ev and @xmath44 ev respectively .",
    "dielectric properties of the third possible substrate , strontium titanate , are strongly dependent on temperature , with@xcite @xmath39 changing from 24000 ( corresponding to @xmath45 mev ) at 4.2k to @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ev ) at 300k .",
    "this suggests a possibility of experimentally varying the value of @xmath34 by using different substrates and/or changing temperature .",
    "theoretical investigations of the double - exchange  superexchange competition have a history of more than 40 years .",
    "it is by now firmly established@xcite that this competition is resolved not via a second - order phase transition from the fm state to a uniform state with a helical or canted magnetic ordering , but rather via separation of the sample into regions characterized by different spin arrangements and conduction electron bandstructures",
    ". we will be interested in the case of phase separation into fm and afm regions with abrupt ising - type boundaries@xcite between them .",
    "this means that the resulting configuration of @xmath19 remains collinear , with all core spins either parallel or anti - parallel to a selected direction .",
    "thus , it is possible to denote a spin state simply by @xmath48 , and the hamiltonian of the conduction electrons becomes a function of @xmath49 .",
    "the large hund s exchange coupling then forces the conduction electrons spins to polarize in parallel with the core spins , resulting@xcite in the following distribution of hopping amplitudes for a given spin configuration @xmath50 : @xmath51 after these simplifications , the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath52 the model , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham_simp ] ) , on the ( bi - partite ) square lattice is invariant under the particle - hole transformation @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , where @xmath55 takes the values 0,1 on the two sublattices . as a result",
    "we note that in the following , @xmath6 acquire the more general meaning of a carrier density , i.e. , either the electronic density or the hole density relative to the half - filled state .",
    "we will now briefly review the ground state properties of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham_simp ] ) at @xmath56 .    when the carrier density @xmath6 is finite , the ground state of the system at @xmath57 is uniform and fm . with increasing @xmath31 beyond a certain critical value @xmath58 ,",
    "this uniform fm state eventually becomes destabilized , and a non - uniform ground state is obtained instead . in this _ phase separated _ state only part of the system is occupied by the fm phase .",
    "we will be interested in the case in which the other part is a simple nel antiferromagnet with zero charge - carrier density .",
    "a variational study@xcite shows that in two dimensions such a phase separated state may be realized only for @xmath59 . at higher values of @xmath31 the magnetic",
    "ordering in either the electron - rich or the electron - poor regions of the sample differs from that of a ferromagnet or a nel antiferromagnet .     in the fm region of a macroscopically phase separated state . ]    thermodynamic equilibrium between macroscopic fm and afm regions means that the thermodynamic potentials in the two phases are equal , @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 @xmath63 is the density of conduction electron states in the fm region .",
    "since the latter is large , @xmath63 can be taken to be the two - dimensional tight - binding density of states , and boundary corrections may be neglected . by solving eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tdstability][eq : omegaafm ] ) for the fermi energy , @xmath64 , one readily obtains the carrier density in the fm region , @xmath65 , via @xmath66 with the result depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : xfmtd ] .",
    "the system remains in a uniform fm state as long as @xmath67 .",
    "the fraction of the system area ( or volume ) , occupied by the fm phase , is given by @xmath68 .",
    "the critical value , @xmath69 , for the onset of phase separation is then determined by the condition @xmath70 .",
    "in addition to the macroscopic phase separation as described above , the double exchange - superexchange competition can also be resolved via an altogether different scenario ( formation of magnetic polarons ) . when a single electron ( or hole ) is lodged into an antiferromagnetically ordered double - exchange magnet with zero charge - carriers , ( @xmath1 ) , a free ( self - trapped ) magnetic polaron , or ferron@xcite ,",
    "is formed around it .",
    "it is essentially a microscopic fm region , containing one charge carrier , in an otherwise afm system . since the propagation of charge is unimpeded in the fm region it acts as a potential well for the sole carrier , which occupies the lowest bound state inside the well .",
    "the polaron binding energy , @xmath71 , ( with respect to the state where the afm order is unperturbed ) can be be easily estimated@xcite .",
    "we consider the case of a diamond - shaped polaron , with @xmath72 sites along each side ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] , upper left ) .",
    "for @xmath73 we find @xmath74 where the first two terms are the ground - state energy of the charge carrier and",
    "the last one represents the superexchange contribution .",
    "expression ( [ polenergy ] ) should be minimized with respect to @xmath75 , resulting in @xmath76 here , the coefficient of the second term depends on the geometry of the fm micro - region ( _ e.g. _ , for a round polaron one would have obtained @xmath77 instead of @xmath78 ) .    the above expressions are valid in the @xmath79 regime ( yielding @xmath80 ) , where it is easy to verify an important statement which is expected to hold for all @xmath31 .",
    "namely , if in the absence of a coulomb interaction @xmath34 , a second carrier is added to the system , it is energetically favorable for the two charge carriers to occupy the two lowest bound states in a _ shared _ fm micro - region rather than to form two independent polarons .",
    "this conclusion is verified by calculating the binding energy of the ( diamond - shaped ) doubly - occupied polaron @xmath81 which clearly satisfies @xmath82 .",
    "this trend continues when further charge is added , and at @xmath83 the binding energy ( per carrier ) of the @xmath84-carrier polaron decreases toward the limiting value @xmath85 , @xmath86 which is the energy gain per carrier associated with the macroscopic phase separated state .",
    "the latter can be evaluated as @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the energies per site of the fm and afm phases .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tdstability ] ) and ( [ eq : tdxfm ] ) to evaluate @xmath64 and @xmath65 we find , in the limit @xmath90 , @xmath91 the inequality , @xmath92 , implies that for any finite carrier density , at @xmath56 , the double - exchange  superexchange competition is resolved via macroscopic phase separation .    notwithstanding the preceding discussion , its conclusion may change if a realistically strong coulomb interaction @xmath34 is included , favoring a large spatial separation between the charge carriers . indeed , as we demonstrate in the following , a polaronic state arises in the regime of large @xmath34 and small carrier density .",
    "it is the extreme limit of a broad range of inhomogeneous states which originate from the frustration of macroscopic phase separation by long - range forces .",
    "the study of this intermediate region of parameters lies at the focus of the remaining part of the paper .",
    "since the typical size of the resulting fm regions is rather small one needs to take into account the effects of quantization of the charge carrier motion . at the same time , some of the results obtained for the macroscopic phase - separated system , such as the directional dependence of the boundary energy@xcite , still offer important guidance to the understanding of the inhomogeneous configurations .",
    "next , we outline the methods used to treat this intermediate regime which is characterized by a combination of both traditional phase separation and magnetic polaron ( quantized ) physics .",
    "given the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham_simp ] ) , our task is to find the configuration of core spins in the ground state .",
    "however , there is a vast multitude of possible spin configurations amongst which the ground state is to be sought , making it impossible to explore all of them .",
    "nevertheless , previous studies of similar or related systems@xcite suggest several families of highly symmetrical configurations as reasonable ground state candidates .",
    "the two main types of spin configurations studied in this work are fm droplets in an afm background , and alternating fm and afm stripes , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] . a uniform fm phase , in which the double - exchange mechanism completely overcomes the superexchange , is also considered .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     calculating the energy of the conduction electrons in a given configuration of core spins is a difficult problem .",
    "here we suffice with the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation , which gives an upper - bound to their ground state energy .",
    "since we are dealing with periodic spin configurations , the hf equations for the whole system can be rewritten as an effective eigenvalue problem within a single unit cell . the superexchange contribution to a configuration s energy",
    "is simply calculated by counting the number of fm and afm bonds in a unit cell .",
    "based on previous analytical results@xcite and numerical investigations@xcite the considered droplets are either diamond or square shaped , and are chosen to form either a triangular or square super - lattice ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] ) .",
    "several droplet phases are possible by combining different droplet shapes and super - lattice types . in addition",
    ", one has variational freedom to specify @xmath75 , the size of the fm droplets , and @xmath84 , the number of conduction electrons in each one of the droplets .",
    "the distance between the droplets , @xmath93 , is then uniquely determined by the type of super - lattice , by @xmath84 , and by the average density of conduction electrons , @xmath6 .",
    "the energy of each droplet phase is found by minimizing its energy density , @xmath94 with respect to the variational parameters , @xmath75 , and @xmath84 .",
    "here @xmath95 is the hf energy of the conduction electrons inside a unit cell containing a single droplet , and @xmath96 is the afm energy _ per site_. the details of the hf calculation appear in appendix [ app : hartree ] .",
    "the main source of complication is the necessity to take into account the hartree interaction between electrons belonging to different droplets in the infinite super - lattice .",
    "this is done by employing ewald s summation method ( see appendix [ app : ewald ] ) .",
    "the afm coupling energy per lattice site is @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the area of a unit cell .",
    "two types of stripe phases were considered : diagonal and bond - aligned .",
    "additional variational freedom comes from the need to specify @xmath99 , the stripe width , and @xmath65 , the ( average ) density of conduction electrons within the fm stripe . just as for the droplet phase ,",
    "the stripe phase energy is found by minimizing its energy density @xmath100 with respect to @xmath99 and @xmath65 .",
    "here @xmath101 and @xmath102 are , respectively , the conduction electrons number and energy per unit cell , and @xmath103 is the afm energy per site .",
    "a unit cell in diagonal stripes is only one lattice spacing long in the direction along the stripe , and two spacings long in bond - aligned stripes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] ) ; its width equals the stripe periodicity .",
    "therefore , @xmath104 @xmath101 , together with @xmath6 , uniquely determine the distance between stripes @xmath105 .    in a similar manner to the case of the droplet phase , when calculating the hf energy one needs to take into account the hartree interaction between the infinite number of unit cells in the systems .",
    "moreover , the extended nature of the states along the stripes means that it is necessary to consider also the fock exchange between different unit cells on the same stripe .",
    "a detailed account of the way this is done is presented in appendix [ app : hartree ] .",
    "the afm spin coupling energy per unit area for both diagonal and bond - aligned stripe phases is @xmath106,\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the fraction of fm regions in the system .    by comparing the energies of all the above mentioned phases ,",
    "a phase diagram is constructed , depicting the nature of the ground state as a function of the external parameters , @xmath6 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "we have supplemented the calculation of the hf energy of various variational configurations by an _",
    "unrestricted _ hf calculation using monte - carlo simulated annealing . in this method , the energy of a finite - sized system is minimized with respect to the full configuration space of core spins , rather than a special subset of spin textures . in each monte - carlo step the energy of a given configuration of classical core spins is evaluated using the hf approximation .",
    "a spin configuration is accepted as the system s new state if the change in energy from the current state satisfies the metropolis condition .",
    "the temperature is slowly decreased until the system reaches a stable , low energy configuration . if the temperature is decreased slowly enough , the final state is the hf approximation of the ground state .",
    "the underlying assumption of the present study is that the system indeed separates into fm and afm regions with an abrupt boundary between them .",
    "therefore , the mc simulation needs to explore only such configurations , improving the convergence time .",
    "this can be achieved by setting all the spins on one sub - lattice to the `` up '' state , and incrementally flipping the spins on the other sub - lattice .",
    "an additional improvement comes from a new algorithm used to decide which spin to flip . at first",
    ", a spin is chosen randomly .",
    "it is flipped if the resulting state satisfies the metropolis criterion .",
    "if the spin is located near a fm - afm boundary then its neighbors are added to a queue of spins to be tested for flipping .",
    "after all the spins in the queue have been tested for a flip , a new spin is chosen randomly .",
    "requiring that a spin be added to the queue no more than once , prevents the simulation from repeating itself , thus maintaining ergodicity .",
    "in our calculations , the system contained @xmath109 sites arranged periodically on a torus .",
    "a linear annealing schedule was employed over @xmath110 mc sweeps , and an identical number of sweeps at the lowest temperature allowed the system to thermalize into the ground state .",
    "the temperatures started from above @xmath111 at the beginning of the annealing schedule to below @xmath112 at its end .",
    "even though this method minimizes the system s energy with respect to an unrestricted configuration space , it has a number of disadvantages when compared to the variational hf method , applied to only a number of special configurations .",
    "first , its periodicity is fixed ; in our case it is @xmath113 sites along each axis .",
    "in addition , the presence of long range interactions causes the simulations to converge very slowly .",
    "nevertheless , it provides an important reference point with which the the variational hf results may be contrasted , especially in order to confirm that the variational manifold contains the most relevant configurations .",
    "in the present section , we present and analyze our numerical results . the coupling constants @xmath31 and",
    "@xmath34 are measured in units of @xmath15 , by setting the hopping amplitude @xmath114 .",
    "the hf energies of all the considered phases were calculated in the parameter range @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and for three values of @xmath34 , namely @xmath117 .",

    "while the stripes phases , which we consider , continue to be relevant in this region , we expect ( and confirm in our mc simulations ) that the phases of fm droplets ought to be replaced by configurations of afm droplets embedded in a fm background .",
    "the latter turn out to be more involved computationally and were left out of the present study .",
    "we also wish to note that the above values of @xmath123 and @xmath124 , are sensitive to the details of the considered model . therefore , while experimentally , percolation of the metallic phase at low temperatures is observed in manganates with @xmath125 , we expect our qualitative conclusions to apply to more complicated models of manganates , as long as phase separation into fm and afm phases is possible .",
    "we begin our review of the results by discussing the phase diagram and presenting general arguments for its structure .",
