    "graphene,@xcite a single hexagonal layer of carbon atoms in two dimensions ( 2d ) , is the building block for graphitic materials ranging from 0d fullerenes to 1d nanotubes , and also the commonly seen 3d graphite .",
    "since it was generally believed that the two - dimensional lattice should not exist at finite temperature , graphene had often been used as a toy model and viewed as an academic material until its recent discovery in laboratory.@xcite the honeycomb structure gives rise to linear dispersion , making electrons and holes in graphene massless as in relativistic theories.@xcite therefore , most studies focus on the electronic and transport properties arisen from this peculiar band structure,@xcite such as the half - integer quantum hall effect@xcite due to the @xmath0 berry phase , the quantization of minimal conductivity where carriers are almost absent@xcite and so on .",
    "one of the potential applications of graphene is to realize fast electronics at nanoscale , making graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) a natural building block for these devices . since the electronic structure sensitively depends on the transverse width and also the edge topology , there are intensive investigations@xcite on narrow gnrs with width less than 10 nm .",
    "although gnrs have been successfully fabricated by lithography@xcite down to the widths of 20 nm , the roughness of the edges remains large ( about 5 nm or larger ) . as a result , theoretical predictions may not be applicable and limit the fundamental and practical applications .",
    "a recent breakthrough of fabricating gnrs came from chemical methods.@xcite it is rather remarkable that the width of the gnrs can be fabricated in a controlled way down to 10 nm .",
    "in addition , the edges of these gnrs are ultra smooth with possibly well - defined zigzag or armchair shapes , suitable for building electric junctions at molecular scale .    as the transverse width shrinks , the quantum fluctuations become important and results / predictions from mean - field theories shall be checked carefully .",
    "meanwhile , since the open boundaries of gnr play a crucial role at nanoscale , the interplay between the coulomb interaction and the edge morphology will lead to rich physics .",
    "for instance , it has been revealed that the coulomb interaction gives rise to edge moments in zigzag gnr.@xcite furthermore , son , cohen , and louie@xcite have shown that , in the presence of external electric field in the transverse direction , the system turns half metallic with magnetic properties controlled by the external electric field .",
    "their results not only show that the electronic spin degrees of freedom can be manipulated by the electric fields , but also bring up the possibility to explore spintronics@xcite at the nanometer scale based on graphene .",
    "inspired by these discoveries , we investigate the effect of coulomb interaction in armchair gnr as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wannier ] .",
    "note that the edges are hydrogenated so that the dangling @xmath1 bonds are saturated and only the @xmath0 bands remain active in low energy.@xcite by combining analytical weak - coupling analysis , numerical density matrix renormalization - group ( dmrg ) method , and the first - principles calculations , we show that armchair gnr exhibits an interesting carrier - mediated ferromagnetism upon appropriate doping . even though only @xmath0 bands are active in low - energy , in appropriate doping regimes , the armchair edges give rise to both itinerant bloch and localized wannier orbitals . as will be explained later , these localized orbitals are direct consequences of quantum interferences in armchair gnr and form flat bands with zero velocity .",
    "the carrier - mediated ferromagnetism can thus be understood in two steps : electronic correlations in the flat band generate intrinsic magnetic moments first , then the itinerant bloch electrons mediate ferromagnetic exchange coupling among them . as a result ,",
    "the magnetic properties of armchair gnr sensitively depend on the doping and thus can be manipulated easily by the external electric fields .",
    "though the ferromagnetic state in armchair gnr stems from the flat - band states which are partially filled , the mechanism is different from the `` flat - band ferromagnetism \" proposed by mielke and tasaki.@xcite the key to mielke - tasaki ferromagnetism is the finite overlap of adjacent wannier orbitals in the flat band : the finite overlaps generate exchange coupling among these orbitals and lead to the flat - band ferromagnetism .",
    "however , the wannier orbital in armchair gnr ( shown in fig .  [ fig : wannier ] ) has _ zero _ overlap with its adjacent neighbors .",
    "the flat band alone only accounts for the existence of the magnetic moments and the ferromagnetic order sets in only when itinerant carriers are present .",
    "a similar mechanism of ferromagnetism has been argued for the hubbard model in a kind of frustrated lattice.@xcite     ( color online ) ( a ) armchair gnr of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "open edges are present at @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the solid circles and squares represent sublattice a and b respectively .",

    "band structures for the infinitely long gnr with ( b ) @xmath8 and ( c ) @xmath9 clearly show the pair of flat bands at @xmath10 . ]    in the following , we will elaborate in details how the carrier - mediated ferromagnetism emerges ( upon appropriate doping ) in the armchair gnr . in sec .",

    "sec : weakcoupling ] , we integrate out the gapped modes and explore the ground state properties in weak coupling .",
    "we first show how the local moments in the flat band form from the coulomb interaction .",
    "we also demonstrate the crucial role of itinerant carriers in dispersive bands , which mediate the indirect exchange coupling among the local moments and give rise to the ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "indeed , without those carriers , the ferromagnetism disappears and only curie - like susceptibility remains in armchair gnr . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dmrg ] , we employ the technique of non - abelian dmrg to investigate the ferromagnetic ground state in intermediate coupling .",
    "it is remarkable that the numerical results agree with the weak - coupling analysis pretty well . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lsda ] , the realistic band structure and the long - range coulomb interactions are included via the first - principles calculations .",
    "it is rather unexpected that the flat band is robust even when the realistic band structure is taken into account .",
    "ferromagnetism appears around the same doping regime as predicted by either weak - coupling or dmrg approaches . finally , in the last section",
    ", we discuss the robustness of our predictions and also their connections to practical experiments .",
    "to understand the carrier - mediated flat - band ferromagnetism in the armchair gnr , we start with the hubbard hamiltonian , @xmath11 + u \\sum_{{\\bf r } } n_{\\uparrow}({\\bf r } ) n_{\\downarrow}({\\bf r}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the hopping amplitude on the honeycomb network , @xmath13 is the on - site repulsion , @xmath14 is the spin index .",

    "note that the above trick only works for @xmath48 eigenstates while the @xmath53 states can be obtained by finding the null space of @xmath54 and @xmath55 alone .    before digging into details",
    ", we would like to make some general remarks .",
    "it is clear that , for each solution @xmath50 , we can construct two wave functions on the other sublattice @xmath56 by two choices of eigenenergies @xmath57 . as a result ,",
    "the energy spectrum is symmetric about @xmath53 and total wave functions of opposite energies @xmath57 only differ by an overall minus sign on one of the sublattices ( but not on the other ) .    with this general picture in mind",
    ", we now turn to the explicit form of the matrix @xmath52 , that can be worked out by straightforward algebra @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "this matrix resembles the hopping hamiltonian of a finite chain with the site potential @xmath62 , nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath63 and next - nearest - neighbor one @xmath64 .",

    "note that the usual plane - wave solutions satisfy the bulk harper equation in eq .",
    "( [ t1t2hopping ] ) .",
    "thus , we only need to form appropriate linear combination of these plane - wave solutions to match the boundary conditions .",

    "however , a closer look would ensure us that the full wave function on the armchair gnr is far simpler than we expected .",
    "the simplification arises from the fact that the supercharges @xmath54 and @xmath72 commute . as a result ,",
    "the matrix @xmath73 share the same eigenstates as the matrices @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",

    ", all the orbitals share the same energy and form a flat band .",
    "this is the one - dimensional analog of the landau level degeneracy for two - dimensional electrons in magnetic field .",
    "the peculiar edge topology at nanoscale replaces the role of the magnetic field in 2d and quenches the kinetic energy of the carriers .    at first sight , it is rather counterintuitive that the local wannier orbital can not move around by quantum hopping .",
    "the static nature is due to perfect destructive quantum interferences which make hopping amplitudes from different sites cancel each other .",
    "thus , the open boundaries of armchair shape play a crucial role for the birth of the wannier orbitals .",
    "furthermore , since the wave function is not zero only at odd @xmath97 coordinates ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : wannier ] ) , it is clear that the adjacent orbitals have zero overlap .",
    "thus , the mielke - tasaki mechanism does not work to couple neighboring orbitals magnetically .",
    "let us concentrate on the flat - band regimes @xmath89 for the armchair gnr with odd @xmath85 .",
    "due to the particle - hole symmetry for the hubbard model , the low - energy physics is dictated by the doping level disregarding whether it is electron or hole doped .",
    "thus , it is convenient to introduce the positive - definite doping level @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the average electron number per site .",
    "the lower and upper bounds of the doping rate @xmath100 for the flat - band regime are obtained from the fermi momenta @xmath101 of the dispersive bands intersecting the flat band . for those dispersive bands ,",
    "the fermi momentum satisfies @xmath102 , which leads to @xmath103 , where @xmath104 : there are @xmath105 pairs of fermi points crossing the flat band .",
    "thus , the system is in the flat - band regime for @xmath106 , where @xmath107 therefore , the flat - band regime shrinks as the transverse width increases and eventually goes to zero in the two - dimansional limit .",
    "this trend highlights the importance of finite transverse width of the system and why the flat - band physics is no longer the dominant player in 2d . in the following",
    ", we will try to write down the effective field theory for both the flat and dispersive bands in weak coupling .",
    "even though we have derived the analytical form of wave functions in armchair gnr , it is still quite complicated to write down the effective field theory . in the flat - band regime , after integrating out gapped bands , there remains a flat band with intersecting dispersive bands .",
    "note that the lattice fermion can be decomposed into eigenstates , @xmath108 where the extra geometric factor is included in the modified wave function @xmath109 . in the low - energy limit",
    ", one can approximate all intersecting bands with linear dispersions , the above expansion is then greatly simplified .",
    "let us work out the chiral - field expansion in the flat - band regime at @xmath6 as an example . in that case",
    ", the effective low - energy theory is described by the flat band and the intersecting dispersive bands of the antibonding sector @xmath110 .",
    "thus , the lattice fermion can be decomposed into the flat - band and pairs of chiral field operators , @xmath111 where @xmath112 represents the chirality .",

    "since the density of states is divergent for the flat band , the dispersive bands can be dropped to the leading order approximation .",
    "the effective hamiltonian , keeping the flat band only , is rather simple , @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the number density of each spin flavor and @xmath119 is the effective on - site interaction for the flat - band orbitals , which can be computed by projection onto the flat band , @xmath120 note that the kinetic energy is quenched in the flat band and thus the ground state contains no quantum fluctuations . to avoid the cost of @xmath119 , the ground state consists of the maximum number of singly - occupied wannier orbitals , which leads to local magnetic moments .",
    "since there is no overlap between adjacent orbitals , these magnetic moments are free and give rise to a large ground - state degeneracy .    to lift the large degeneracy of the ground state , interaction with the itinerant carriers in the dispersive bands _ must _ be included .",
    "while the effective hamiltonian for the interaction contains other terms , the terms to play a key role are the exchange interactions which couple the local moments and the itinerant carriers , @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the spin density operator for the local moments and @xmath123 is the spin density of itinerant carriers in the crossing band @xmath124 .",
    "the exchange integral is given by , @xmath125 using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : phif ] ) and ( [ eq : phipm ] ) , we obtain the exchange integral due to the on - site interaction @xmath126 ; it has a rather simple form , @xmath127 the subscript @xmath128 is dropped because the coupling strength does not depend on the chirality .",
    "thus , the on - site interaction induces a ferromagnetic coupling between the local moments in the flat band and the itinerant spins in the dispersive bands .",
    "the exchange coupling @xmath129 tends to align the local moments from the flat band because it does not cause any extra kinetic energy .",
    "the ferromagnetically aligned moments act back on the itinerant carriers and induce finite polarization in the dispersive bands .",
    "the interacting hamiltonian @xmath130 therefore shows interesting two - step flat - band ferromagnetism ",
    "electronic correlations in the flat band give rise to local moments without direct exchange coupling , while the presence of gapless itinerant carriers mediates the ferromagnetic order .",
    "the significant feature of the armchair gnr is that , even within the one - orbital hubbard model without any magnetic impurity nor additional localized levels , the electronic correlations give rise to _ both _ local moments and itinerant carriers simultaneously due to the peculiar topology of the open edges .",
    "it is also interesting to consider the finite - size effect arisen from the length @xmath131 of the armchair gnr .",
    "if one imposes the periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath26-direction , the system becomes a short segment of armchair nanotube . in this case , only when the quantized momenta @xmath132 ( @xmath133 ) coincide with the fermi points @xmath134 , the gapless itinerant carriers are present and the ferromagnetic ground state is realized . for open boundary conditions with finite @xmath131 ,",
    "the situation is much more complicated ; @xmath135 is no longer good quantum number and the band structure can be deformed by finite @xmath131 .",

    "[ bsnm](c ) , the energy gain of the ferromagnetic state per unit cell raises noticeably , especially near the optimal doping , up to @xmath187 37 mev / cell .",
    "these results clearly support the emergence of the ferromagnetism .",
    "the obtained value of the magnetic moment @xmath185 per unit cell indicates that the nearly - flat band is almost fully - polarized at the optimal doping .",
    "this feature is also shown by the spin decomposed band structure in fig .",
    "[ bsfm](a ) .",
    "the bandwidth of the nearly - flat band at the optimal doping is slightly suppressed to @xmath188 ev because of the reduced density .",
    "the exchange splitting between opposite spins is about 0.5 ev . figures  [ bsfm](b ) and ( c ) demonstrate respectively the top and side views of the spin density distribution at the optimal doping .",
    "it is truly remarkable that the profile of the spin density is almost identical to the wannier orbital in the weak - coupling limit ( see fig .  [ fig : wannier ] ) .",
    "the nodes caused by destructive quantum interferences can be seen clearly in the numerics .",
    "we emphasize that not only the dumb - bell shape of the spin density emerges as predicted , the optimal doping concentration and the size of the spin polarization realized also agree with the prediction of the weak - coupling theory .",
    "as the hole doping increases further , the magnetic moment as well as the energy gain of the ferromagnetic state are suppressed .",
    "the ground state eventually turns nonmagnetic at larger hole doping .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the ferromagnetic ground state , as shown in fig .",
    "[ bsnm ] , exists for @xmath189 , which is wider than the flat - band regime between @xmath190 and @xmath191 predicted by weak - coupling theory for @xmath8 armchair gnr .",
    "the ferromagnetic phase obtained by the local spin - density approximation then seems to persist even slightly outside the flat - band regime .",
    "this shall not be surprising since the interaction strength is no longer weak in comparison with the kinetic energy . to address this issue",
    ", one can calculate the variational energy of the hubbard model in the armchair gnr@xcite to pin down the ferromagnetic regime at finite interaction strength @xmath22 .",
    "considering the gnr slightly outside the flat - band regime , although costing higher kinetic energy , it is still preferential to fill in particles / holes in the flat band since the exchange energy is lowered .",
    "thus , we expect that the ferromagnetic ground state can exist even outside the flat - band regime .",
    "the variational calculations indeed show that the above understanding is correct and the ferromagnetic phase exists in a wider range than the flat - band regime .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the inclusion of the realistic coulomb interaction will give rise to similar enhancement of the flat - band ferromagnetism as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ bsnm ] here .",
    "here we would like to elaborate on several subtle points which were not discussed in previous sections .",
    "first , we note that the weak - coupling theory in sec .",
    "[ sec : weakcoupling ] developed for the hubbard model in the armchair gnr is pretty robust against lattice distortions . in practical graphite network ,",
    "the hopping along horizontal and tilted vertical bonds is expected to be slightly different .",
    "though the deviation shifts the flat band from @xmath87 , the bands remain flat and the same mechanism of the ferromagnetism applies .    furthermore , the profile of the short - range interaction does not seem to do much harm either .",
    "following steps similar to those in sec .",
    "[ sec : weakcoupling ] , we can compute the exchange coupling due to nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath192 ( tilted vertical bonds ) and @xmath193 ( horizontal bonds ) .",
    "since the product of the flat - band wave function @xmath194 if the coordinates are connected by a tilted vertical bond , @xmath192 does not give rise to any exchange coupling .",
    "on the other hand , the nearest - neighbor interaction along the horizontal bonds @xmath193 gives rise to non - vanishing exchange coupling , @xmath195 here we have used the expression for the interaction @xmath196 with the notation @xmath197 for @xmath198 . as expected , the exchange couplings arisen from right-/left - moving fields in the same dispersive band are the same and thus the subscript @xmath128 is dropped .",
    "we thereby find that , in the presence of the nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath192 and @xmath193 , the exchange coupling in eq .",
    "( [ exchangehamiltonian ] ) becomes @xmath199 since @xmath200 is often expected , the exchange coupling is still ferromagnetic and the picture does not change .",
    "the above calculations can be generalized to the screened short - ranged interaction .",
    "suppose the spatial profile of the screened interaction goes as @xmath201 , where @xmath202 is a short - range cutoff ( comparable to the lattice constant ) and @xmath203 is the length scale of the short - ranged interaction .",
    "ignoring the complicated form factor due to detail orbital overlapping , the exchange coupling takes the general form @xmath204 .",
    "as expected , the exchange coupling decreases as the distance is far apart .",
    "furthermore , the oscillatory factor @xmath205 makes the couplings to the dispersive bands with different signs and tends to cancel each other .",
    "it will further suppress the effects of the exchange coupling beyond the nearest neighbors .",
    "this trend is in agreement with our first - principles calculations where the true long - ranged coulomb interaction is included .    to realize the flat - band ferromagnetism in armchair gnr , the crucial challenge lies in how to achieve the appropriate doping level .",
    "one of graphene s superior properties is its pronounced ambipolar electric field effect.@xcite by applying gate voltages , the charge carriers can be tuned between electrons and holes with concentration up to @xmath206 @xmath207 .",
    "even so , it is unlikely that the external gate voltage alone can pour enough electrons / holes into the system to reach the flat - band regime .",
    "another route to dope gnr is via chemical doping .",
    "it was demonstrated@xcite that the chemical dopants in the substrate can markably change the carrier density .",
    "perhaps the combination of both methods can be even more efficient .    in conclusion , by combining the weak - coupling analysis , the non - abelian dmrg technique , and the first - principles calculations ,",
    "we show how ferromagnetism occurs in armchair gnr ",
    "electronic correlations give rise to magnetic moments in the flat band and the itinerant carriers in the dispersive bands mediate ferromagnetic coupling between these uncoupled moments .",
    "recently , there are proposals@xcite to use gnr to build transistors and spin qubits .",
    "while these proposals take care of many realistic issues , the electronic correlations are ignored .",
    "our study here show that electronic correlations in gnr can bring up surprises such as the carrier - mediated flat - band ferromagnetism .",
    "therefore , it is crucially important to include the correlation effects when we try to realize these proposals into devices .",
    "we acknowledge leon balents , greg fiete , yukitoshi motome and tsutomu momoi for valuable discussions and comments .",

    "the hospitality of kitp in santa barbara is also greatly appreciated .",
    "precisely , the situation considered in ref .",
    "is different from ours ; the model discussed in ref",
    ".   leads to a ferromagnetic state in the weak - coupling limit when a dispersive band _ touches _ a flat band being at the bottom of the whole band structure . on the other hand , in the armchair gnr , the dispersive bands _ intersect _ with the flat band which lies inside the band structure .",
    "the high - spin ground state with @xmath208 for @xmath209 seen in fig .  [ fig : gap ] is due to an intersection of two dispersive bands at a high - doping rate [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : wannier ] ( b ) ] and does not lead to a bulk ferromagnetism in the thermodynamic limit .    in the lattice geometry of armchair gnr ,",
    "rather large unit cells consisting of 2@xmath85 sites are connected via @xmath105 bonds , resulting in a rapid increase of the number of sites with @xmath131 and a loose connection between unit cells .",
    "furthermore , for the flat - band regime , there are many low - lying states with extremely small energy scale , especially for the cases of @xmath131 where the itinerant electron at the flat - band level is absent .",
    "these facts lead to a very slow convergence of the dmrg calculation and require a large number of kept dmrg states for achieving accurate results .",
