    "the spectrum before the peak is hard with a photon index 1.87@xmath70.2 and then it softens to 2.2@xmath70.2 . both are consistent with the time  integrated spectrum .",
    "the derived peak time of the lat received flux translates into an estimate of the bulk lorentz factor @xmath27 at the start of the afterglow .",
    "the peak time of the afterglow bolometric luminosity occurs at a time of the order of the deceleration time . if the circumburst number density @xmath28 is homogeneous we have ( e.g. sari & piran 1999 ) : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the isotropic kinetic energy of the fireball , estimated through the emitted energy of the prompt emission assuming an efficiency @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "we use eq .",
    "[ tpeak ] to estimate @xmath27 . setting @xmath33 erg ( a09 , excluding the lat component ) , @xmath34 and @xmath35 s we derive @xmath36 .",
    "this value is not much larger than the lower limits derived by a09 through the compactness argument and assuming that the lat component belongs to the prompt emission .",
    "it is also rather insensitive to the ( unknown ) particle density @xmath28 .",
    "the distance from the central engine corresponding to the peak time is @xmath37 cm .",
    "following standard arguments , the minimum electron energy of the injected electrons in the forward shock is @xmath38 , while the magnetic field value is @xmath39 .",
    "electrons with @xmath40 emit an observed synchrotron frequency @xmath41 mev .",
    "this frequency is below the lat energy range , but the injection of a power law distribution of electrons extending to @xmath42@xmath43 ensures that the lat flux can indeed have a synchrotron origin . the synchrotron self  compton ( ssc ) spectrum extends to much higher frequencies ( e.g. fan et al .",
    "2008 , corsi et al .",
    "2009 ) , but becomes important only above @xmath44 , i.e. above the tev energy range .",
    "note the strong dependence of @xmath45 and @xmath46 on the bulk lorentz factor : a synchrotron origin of a @xmath3gev afterglow is reasonable only for rather large @xmath27 , while the ssc flux becomes more important for smaller @xmath27 .",
    "this has a simple and important consequence .",
    "bursts with @xmath47 or smaller can produce high energy afterglow radiation through the ssc mechanism but _ the onset time of their afterglows _ will be large , in turn implying , for the same emitted energy , a lower luminosity ( see also kumar & barniol duran 2009 ) .",
    "they are then more difficult to detect .",
    "the best candidates for a lat detection are therefore bursts with large @xmath27 , because this ensures an early onset of the afterglow , implying large luminosities .",
    "the arrival time of the 30 gev photon coincides with the peak of the afterglow emission .",
    "this is reasonable , because this is the time when we have the maximum probability to detect it ( maximum flux and hard spectrum ) .",
    "_ if we assume _ that the 30 gev photon was indeed produced at the peak time , then the maximum possible time delay it can have is of the order of the width of the time bin of the peak ( 0.15 s ) .",
    "more conservatively , we can assume that the 30 gev photon was produced right at the beginning of the afterglow and it arrives delayed by 0.22 s due to violation of the lorentz invariance .",
    "the time delay @xmath48 between the arrival time of a low and a high energy photon in the case of a linear dependence of the photon s propagation speed on its energy is @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the difference between the low and high photon energy and @xmath51 is the quantum  gravity mass ( a09 ; amelino  camelia et al .",
    "1998 ; jacob & piran 2008 ) .    for a delay of 0.15",
    "s we derive @xmath52 while the more conservative limit ( delay of 0.217 s ) is @xmath53 ( we used @xmath54 ) .",
    "these limits are consistent with those of a09 , but excludes their lowest estimates .",
    "the detection of an early high energy emission in the gev range inevitably flags a large bulk lorentz factor @xmath27 : to avoid suppression of the gev emission due to the @xmath55@xmath56 process if the high energy photons belong to the prompt phase , or to have an early peak flux time if the emission belongs to the afterglow phase .",
    "we have shown that the latter case is indeed favored ( see also gao et al .",
    "2009 ) , because we see the peak time of the emission in the lat light  curve ( as also seen in other grbs in the infrared  optical band , see e.g. molinari et al .",
    "2007 for grb 060418 and grb 060607a ) . furthermore , also the energy spectral index @xmath4 is very similar to the ones we see in the afterglow phase . a large @xmath27 , implying an early onset of the afterglow , means a large luminosity at the peak time ( for equal emitted energy ) , and large typical frequencies .",
    "this makes synchrotron the most likely process for the lat emission we see .",
    "grbs with smaller @xmath27 will have their prompt emission less blue  shifted , and it would be more difficult for them to reach the lat energy range during their prompt phase .",
    "their afterglows can , through the ssc process , but their afterglow peak time is longer , and so their fluxes are fainter ( as @xmath57 if they emit , at the peak , the same amount of energy , see eq .",
    "2 ) . a large @xmath27 , instead , means a large blue ",
    "shift for the photons of the prompt , an early onset of the afterglow , implying more flux at the peak , and finally larger intrinsic afterglow frequencies , allowing even the synchrotron photons of the afterglow to reach the lat energy range .",
    "therefore grbs with large @xmath27 should be much more luminous in the lat energy range than the other grbs ( see also kumar & barniol duran 2009 ) .",
    "the limits derived here on the quantum gravity mass scale are not very different from the ones derived by a09 , but we could associate the gbm and the lat fluxes to two different components .",
    "we can then argue that the high energy photons are _ generated _ at ( slightly ) later times than the photons detected by the gbm , and the delay of their _ arrival _ times is not entirely due to quantum gravity effects . instead , since photons above 100 mev belong to the same component they are the best tool to investigate quantum gravity effects .",
    "this suggests a recipe for a robust test on the lorentz invariance violation , possible with very _",
    "bright _ and _ short _ bursts detected at high energies .",
    "a _ short _ duration of the prompt ensures that the fireball has a relatively narrow width , and in turn this should correspond to a well  defined afterglow peak .",
    "bright _ flux ensures good photon statistics , enabling to measure more accurately possible delays as a function of photon energies .",
