    "graphene is the focus of many research activities due to its remarkable electronic properties.@xcite the magnetic properties of graphene also attract considerable attention because of their potential use in spintronics.@xcite the intrinsic magnetism of graphene , being theoretically predicted for localized defects or edge - states,@xcite represents a challenging problem for experimental studies due to the enhanced chemical reactivity of magnetic centers that quenches magnetism in the presence of minor contamination .",
    "furthermore , no magnetic ordering has been observed in defective graphene even at liquid helium temperatures,@xcite which suggests that this kind of magnetism can hardly be employed in practical applications .",
    "one of the natural ways to induce a magnetic moment in a closed - shell compound is to include magnetic impurities , such as transition metal ( tm ) atoms , to the system .",
    "apart from being magnetically stable , deposition of tm adatoms on the graphene surface may give rise to a variety of many - body effects ( such as , e.g. , the kondo effect),@xcite known mainly for tm adatoms supported on metallic substrates.@xcite    in contrast to molecular closed - shell adsorbates,@xcite light monovalent impurities,@xcite or even some insulating substrates,@xcite a theoretical investigation of tm adatoms on graphene is more challenging due to the presence of strong electron correlations . commonly used _",
    "ab initio _ concepts , such as density functional theory ( dft ) or single - determinant hartree - fock ( hf ) approaches , are often unreliable even in terms of a qualitative description of the tm complexes .",
    "dft results may vary depending on the parametrization of the exchange - correlation functional , whereas the applicability of the hf - based methods is questionable for systems with near - degeneracies .",
    "the latter is attributed to the inherent limitation of single - reference approaches , such as the inability to treat correlation effects arising from the mixture of low - lying electronic configurations .",
    "although the model hamiltonian approaches are appealing and widely used to investigate strongly correlated systems , their results often depend on a number of adjustable parameters , which prevent these approaches from being a stand - alone tool for studying real materials .    among the other first - row transition metals , cobalt holds a special place due to the remarkable magnetic properties of its compounds related to high curie temperatures and large magnetic anisotropies .",
    "the experimentally observed kondo effect in the system of co on graphene,@xcite followed by considerable efforts in the description of this phenomenon,@xcite make co on graphene one of the most attractive candidates for theoretical studies among the other tm / graphene systems .    while there are only a few experimental works,@xcite",
    "there have been numerous theoretical dft - based studies that were focused on co on pristine graphene.@xcite with respect to chemical bonding , dft studies predict strong covalent interaction arising from the hybridization between the cobalt 3@xmath8- and graphene @xmath11-orbitals , resulting in a low - spin adatom configuration ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the hybridization leads to relatively large binding energies of @xmath1212 ev , depending on the initial electronic configuration of the co atom , and also on the particular parametrization of the dft exchange - correlation functional .",
    "large binding energies obtained within the dft generally imply high migration barriers and , therefore , thermodynamic stability of co atoms on graphene .",
    "however , this implication seems to be inconsistent with the existing experimental evidence of fast surface diffusion of transition metal adatoms on graphene , as concluded from transmission electron microscopy experiments.@xcite this observation suggests a weak bonding , and that there may be another mechanism behind the co  graphene interaction .",
    "not many attempts have been made thus far to go beyond the standard local [ local density approximation ( lda ) ] or semilocal [ generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) ] exchange - correlation approximations with respect to co on graphene . wehling _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite studied this system by using the gga+@xmath6 approach and showed that the results depend qualitatively on the on - site coulomb repulsion parameter @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , the application of @xmath13 ev leads to a rearrangement of the ground - state electronic configuration of co in such a way that its spin state changes from @xmath5 to @xmath14 due to the @xmath15 promotion .",
    "besides , as the @xmath6 parameter increases , the adsorption energy of the adatom becomes significantly lower , leading to a larger co  graphene separation .",
    "similar results were reported by chan _ _ et al.__@xcite the employment of hybrid functionals that incorporate some fraction of the exact nonlocal exchange also leads to qualitatively similar results , as demonstrated by jacob _ _ et al.__@xcite it was also shown in ref .   that the inclusion of the co  graphene hybridization in terms of a many - body theory ( one - crossing approximation method ) significantly affects the splittings of the @xmath16 cobalt orbitals in the crystal field of graphene .",
    "all these results indicate a key role of electronic correlations in the determination of the ground - state properties of the co  graphene system , and they suggest that more systematic and reliable approaches should be used in order to properly describe electronic properties and chemical bonding of co on graphene . in turn ,",
    "accurate calculations of these properties are necessary to judge how stable co impurities on graphene are , and how the properties of graphene itself are affected by the impurities .",
    "in contrast to previous first - principles studies , in the present paper a wave - function - based approach to investigate a co adatom on graphene is employed .",
    "we use the multiconfigurational complete active space self - consistent field formalism ( casscf ) along with second - order perturbation theory , which allows us to treat static ( strong ) and dynamical ( weak ) electron correlations in a balanced way .",
    "the main advantages this method offers compared to the dft are : ( i ) systematic treatment of the exchange - correlation effects , ( ii ) proper electronic configuration of free tm atoms , ( iii ) the presence of dispersive interactions , ( iv ) correct asymptotic behavior in the dissociation limit for open - shell systems , and ( v ) the possibility to study excited states .",
    "the price to be paid is the fact that the applicability of this method is currently limited only to finite and relatively small systems .",
    "as a result , it is necessary to model the infinite graphene lattice by a finite cluster , approximated in this work by a coronene molecule ( c@xmath0h@xmath1 ) .",
    "this approximation looks reasonable if the _",
    "local _ adatom - substrate interactions dominate in the system .",
    "similar cluster approaches have been used so far to investigate local correlation effects in extended systems by means of the multireference quantum chemical methods ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "we show that there are two binding mechanisms of co on graphene , which lead to different electron configurations of co ( high - spin @xmath2 and low - spin @xmath4 ) .",
    "the first arises from the weak dispersive interaction ( physisorption ) , while the second comes from the strong orbital hybridization ( chemisorption ) . despite the chemisorption ,",
    "the adsorption energies are small and do not exceed 0.35 ev in both cases , which is substantially lower than the binding predicted in previously reported studies .",
    "we analyze the results using a simple model hamiltonian , and we conclude that the systematic account of the electron correlations is crucial for a proper description of the adsorption of tm atoms on graphene . based on this fact , we discuss the limitations and applicability of the dft - based approaches to the tm / graphene systems .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "iv  d. in the last section ( sec .",
    "v ) , we briefly summarize our results and conclude this study .",
    "many unique physical properties of graphene are determined by its gapless cone - shaped band structure , which arises as a result of the regular arrangement of carbon atoms in the honeycomb lattice .",
    "if translational symmetry of the lattice is broken , e.g. , by contact with defects , impurities , or underlying surfaces , the electronic structure also changes , affecting the properties of graphene .",
    "moreover , graphene should be spatially quite extended to retain its properties .",
    "in particular , properties of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) are known to converge extremely slowly with the increase of the number of six - membered carbon rings .",
    "theoretical estimations show that the highest occupied molecular orbital - lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( homo - lumo ) gap in large pah molecules closes only at a cluster size of @xmath17 1000 benzene rings.@xcite    however , by investigating the local phenomena , such as , for example , interactions with atoms ( molecules ) , an exact description of graphene s electronic structure is not necessary .",
    "bonding caused by covalent interactions is essentially local and determined primarily by the atomic arrangement as well as by the interatomic interactions in the host structure .",
    "these interactions vanish very rapidly with distance and thus depend only on the local surroundings of an impurity .",
    "therefore , it appears reasonable to consider only a local part of graphene for modeling this type of interaction .",
    "another aspect of strong chemical bonding is the ionic interactions , which scale linearly with distance for an unscreened case . in this situation ,",
    "not only do neighboring atoms influence the bonding , but a rather large cluster is required to describe the interaction in the impurity - substrate system .",
    "ionic interactions occur mainly in the case of charge transfer between an impurity and a surface .",
    "as we will show below , although in the case of maximal 3@xmath8 shell filling ( 3@xmath18 ) some electron transfer from co to graphene is expected , the charge transfer is quite small and any significant role of the distant surface atoms can be ruled out .",
    "a similar reasoning can be applied to the van der waals ( vdw ) interaction due to its weak strength .",
    "the aforementioned arguments allow us to model the surface of graphene by using the finite cluster approach .",
    "more specifically , we consider a molecule of coronene ( c@xmath0h@xmath1 ) to be a cluster for the local graphene structure ( fig .",
    "[ coronene ] ) .",
    "similar finite models have been used so far in studies on the physisorption of atoms ( molecules ) on graphene ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) . to make the cluster more realistic , the c",
    " c bond lengths of coronene were adjusted to the bond length of graphene ( 1.42  ) . due to symmetry reasons as well as for the sake of computational simplicity ,",
    "we consider only the center of this cluster as an adsorption site for the co adatom .",
    "this site corresponds to a hollow site ( @xmath19 coordination ) on graphene and has been repeatedly predicted to be the most favorable adsorption site for co on undistorted graphene , according to previous dft studies .",
    "the same adsorption site is predicted for the cobalt - coronene complex.@xcite it is worth noting that relaxation of graphene may lead to the change of the most stable position of cobalt toward a top site , as has been shown in the gga+@xmath6 studies.@xcite however , the energy difference between hollow and top sites was predicted to be quite small . in our study",
    "we do not take the effects of surface relaxation into account and we assume that graphene is locally flat .        due to the @xmath20 point symmetry , the @xmath16 orbitals of cobalt supported on a hollow site of graphene split into a single degenerate @xmath21 orbital , and two doubly degenerate @xmath22 and @xmath23 orbitals , derived from the @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) , and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) atomic orbitals , respectively . since the @xmath11 orbitals of graphene transform according to the @xmath22 and @xmath23 representations in the vicinity of the fermi level , the hybridization between the cobalt orbitals of @xmath21 symmetry ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) and graphene @xmath11 orbitals is suppressed .",
    "the starting point of an _ ab initio _ quantum chemical treatment is the hf approximation .",
    "the hf method is able to describe only the electrostatic and exchange contributions to the electron - electron interaction energy , whereas correlation effects are not taken into account , @xmath31 .",
    "a hierarchy of widely used post - hf approaches [ many - body perturbation theories , truncated configuration interaction ( ci ) , and coupled cluster ( cc ) methods]@xcite is applicable primarily to the closed - shell systems , where correlation effects are rather weak and do not significantly affect the electronic structure of the system under investigation .",
    "this type of correlations is usually referred to as _ dynamical _",
    "correlations,@xcite according to the nomenclature commonly used in the quantum chemical literature . on the other hand , strong correlations may substantially affect electronic structure , so that the initial hf wave function ( single slater determinant ) becomes unreliable and not suitable for further corrections .",
    "this is often the case for open - shell systems with near - degeneracies , including tm compounds .",
    "effects that can not be properly described at the single - determinant level are usually referred to as _",
    "static _ correlations .",
    "total correlation energy can thus be given as the sum of the static and dynamical terms , @xmath32.@xcite    one of the efficient _ ab initio _ approaches that allows systematic treatment of the static correlations is the casscf method.@xcite in this method , the wave function is constructed as a full ci expansion within a limited set of _ active _ orbitals , for which all possible occupations are allowed .",
    "the other orbitals ( inactive ) have occupation numbers exactly equal to 2 and are treated at the hf level .",
    "importantly , not only expansion coefficients but also the orbitals are simultaneously optimized in the casscf , which makes this method quite flexible .",
    "dynamical correlations can be taken into account on top of the casscf wave function using multireference perturbation theories . in this work ,",
    "we employ the nonrelativistic casscf method in conjunction with the strongly contracted variant of the second - order @xmath33-electron valence state perturbation theory ( nevpt2)@xcite as implemented in the orca program package.@xcite    in all calculations we employed the ahlrichs triple-@xmath34 valence basis set ( tzv)@xcite for all atoms .",
    "the cobalt atom and its six neighboring carbon atoms ( central ring in the coronene molecule ) were additionally supplemented by ( 2@xmath35)- and ( @xmath8)-polarization functions ( tzvpp and tzvp basis sets ) , respectively.@xcite we did not apply any basis set superposition error ( bsse ) corrections to the calculated energy values .",
    "the counterpoise correction ( cp),@xcite widely used in highly accurate quantum chemical calculations , does not usually lead to significant changes in the interaction energies for weakly bounded systems , whereas its application to strongly bounded systems is controversial.@xcite moreover , the reliability of the cp with respect to the multiconfiguration methods appears questionable . as a starting point for the casscf calculations",
    ", we used the natural orbitals obtained at the level of unrestricted single - reference mller - plesset second - order perturbation theory ( mp2 ) .",
    "the calculated energies and orbital gradients were converged within 10@xmath36 and 10@xmath37 a.u .",
    ", respectively . it should also be noted that upon evaluation of four - index integrals , we _ did not _ use any simplifications such as , e.g. , the resolution of the identity approximation ( ri).@xcite      the active space used in this work for the casscf calculations consists of five 3@xmath8 co orbitals , one 4@xmath38 co orbital , and two pairs of bonding ( @xmath39 ) and antibonding ( @xmath40 ) orbitals of the coronene molecule .",
    "this gives rise to 13 correlated electrons in 10 active orbitals [ cas(13,10 ) ] . in fig .",
    "[ act_space ] , we show schematically the active space in the form of natural orbitals obtained at the cas(13,10 ) level for the ground state of co at the distance of @xmath41   from the surface .        by selecting the surface orbitals , we were guided by the following criteria : ( i ) the orbitals should be localized in the center of the surface",
    ", i.e. , in spatial proximity to the co atom ; ( ii ) the orbitals should be either of @xmath22 or @xmath23 symmetry , since the contribution of the orbitals of @xmath21 symmetry is not likely in the graphene - impurity bonding ; ( iii ) the orbitals should be close to the fermi level and represent a bonding - antibonding pair in order to mimic the @xmath11 and @xmath42 orbitals of graphene .",
    "the chosen surface orbitals obey these criteria .",
    "moreover , except for the @xmath21 metal orbital , for all the other metal orbitals there is a corresponding ligand pair of the same symmetry .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the shape of the selected @xmath11 orbitals of coronene is similar to the maximally localized wannier functions associated with the @xmath11 orbitals of graphene.@xcite    we note that in order to avoid unreasonably expensive calculations , our choice of active orbitals does not include explicitly the 3@xmath8 double shell effect , which is still needed for an accurate treatment of the excitation energies in tm atoms.@xcite as we will show , however , the size of the chosen active space is sufficient to obtain a reasonable agreement between calculated and experimental values of the @xmath43 promotion energies for a single co atom .",
    "the filling of the @xmath8-shells of tm atoms is known to occur in competition between the @xmath8 and @xmath38 states . as a result",
    ", low - lying excitations in the spectrum of a single atom are composed exclusively of the 3@xmath8  @xmath44  4@xmath38 transitions .",
    "this competition is more pronounced upon formation of tm complexes where tm  ligand bonding takes place .",
    "while all first - row tm atoms accommodate electrons in the 4@xmath38 shell , the occupation of this shell becomes much less favorable upon contact with a ligand due to the pauli repulsion between the ligand and the very diffuse 4@xmath38 orbital of the tm atom .",
    "therefore , for investigating the adsorption of tm atoms , it is of great importance to take into account the interplay between different electronic states . besides the general consideration",
    ", the important role of the 3@xmath8 and 4@xmath38 orbitals in the interaction of co with graphene has been shown by previous studies.@xcite    to investigate the role of different electronic states in adsorption of co on graphene , we consider five different electronic configurations of co : ( a ) 3@xmath454@xmath46 ( @xmath47=3/2 ) , ( b ) 3@xmath484@xmath49 ( @xmath47=3/2 ) , ( c ) 3@xmath454@xmath46 ( @xmath47=1/2 ) , ( d ) 3@xmath484@xmath49 ( @xmath47=1/2 ) , and ( e ) 3@xmath184@xmath50 ( @xmath47=1/2 ) .",
    "as one can see , these states correspond to two quartet and three doublet states with different occupancies of the 3@xmath8 and 4@xmath38 co shells .",
    "the experimental ground state of a single cobalt atom corresponds to a high - spin quartet state , 3@xmath454@xmath46 . unlike the lda / gga results obtained within the dft,@xcite",
    "this state can be predicted even at the hartree - fock level of theory .",
    "however , in order to obtain reasonable excitation energies , a multireference treatment is required.@xcite    in table [ table1 ] , we show the excitation energies of a single co atom calculated at the nevpt2 level for the considered electronic states .",
    "these states can be assigned to the lowest atomic terms of the corresponding configurations in the experimental spectrum as follows ( in ascending order ) : @xmath51 ( ground ) , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55.@xcite the energies of these terms , averaged over the spin - orbit components @xmath56 , are given in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the states @xmath52 and @xmath53 correspond to the two low - lying excited states of co , while the others ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) relate to much higher excitations .",
    "one can see that the calculated energies of the first two excited states are in very good agreement with experiment , while for the third excited state the agreement is slightly worse .",
    "the maximum discrepancy can be seen in the case of the highest energy level .",
    "this is not surprising in view of the fact that the active space used in this work is restricted only to the 3@xmath8 and 4@xmath38 orbitals , whereas higher orbitals are necessary to properly describe the high - energy excitations .",
    "another necessary condition for an accurate prediction of the excited energy levels is relativistic corrections,@xcite which were also not utilized in the present work .",
    "nevertheless , despite some quantitative discrepancies , the agreement obtained between theoretical and experimental spectra for a single co atom can be considered as satisfactory .",
    "the consistency achieved with experimental data shows the reliability of the computational approach as well as an adequate choice of parameters for studying the co  graphene system .    .calculated and experimental excitation energies of a single co atom corresponding to transitions from the ground ( 3@xmath454@xmath46 , @xmath47=3/2 ) to low - lying excited states associated with the electronic configurations considered in this work .",
    "experimental energies correspond to the @xmath56 averaged value of the lowest atomic term of a given configuration ( ref .  ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the adsorption of transition metals differs from the adsorption of monovalent or closed - shell adsorbates . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ energies ] , the ground - state electronic structure of co undergoes several transitions upon adsorption . in turn , the adsorption energy curve ( the minimum energy curve ) is composed of three different potential energy curves .",
    "as the atom approaches the surface , its most favorable configuration ( quartet , @xmath2 ) changes to @xmath57 ( quartet ) at a distance of @xmath122.6  , and to @xmath58 ( doublet ) at shorter distances ( @xmath121.8  ) .",
    "this behavior can be qualitatively understood by noting that in the vicinity of the ligand , the occupation of the @xmath30 orbital becomes less favorable due to the pauli repulsion , while the occupation of the @xmath16 orbital becomes more favorable due to the screening of the coulomb repulsion in the 3@xmath8 shell of co. we analyze these effects in more detail in sec .",
    "iv  c. the energies of the two other doublet configurations lie higher over the entire range of distances .",
    "the absolute values of the adsorption energies are quite small , reaching 0.32 ev in the high - spin @xmath2 case , while in the other cases the values are even smaller ( see table [ table2 ] )",
    ". these values are significantly smaller than the adsorption energy predicted by the dft studies ( @xmath1212 ev),@xcite but are consistent with experimental observations of the fast surface diffusion of metal atoms on graphene,@xcite which suggest weak bonding in the system .",
    "although the minimum energy curve shown in fig .  [ energies ] exhibits three extrema , only two of them ( low - spin , @xmath58 and high - spin , @xmath2 ) are well separated and can be regarded as stable configurations . the third minimum ( high - spin , @xmath57 ) corresponds to the metastable state . among the two stable configurations ,",
    "the high - spin minimum lies lower in energy than the low - spin one and , therefore , represents the global minimum .",
    "as the low - spin configuration is less favorable in absolute values , there is an energy barrier to reach this state . on the other hand ,",
    "if the adatom is trapped in the low - spin state , another barrier has to be overcome to return in the high - spin configuration .",
    "the energy barriers can be estimated as a difference between the transition state and high - spin ( low - spin ) state energies . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ energies ] , there is a transition state at a distance of 1.85    with an energy of 0.24 ev . taking this state into account , we obtain the energy barriers of 0.56 and 0.29 ev , respectively for the high - spin@xmath59low - spin and low - spin@xmath59high - spin transitions .",
    "we note that a qualitatively similar multiple - minima structure of the potential energy curves has been reported for graphene adsorbed on metal surfaces.@xcite    let us analyze the nature of the co  graphene interactions . the maximum adsorption energy obtained for co ( 0.32 ev ) is comparable with adsorption energies typical for small closed - shell molecules adsorbed on graphene,@xcite where only weak vdw interaction plays a dominant role .",
    "in fact , the same mechanism is responsible for the adsorption of co in the @xmath2 and @xmath57 configurations . in these cases ,",
    "the hybridization between the localized 3@xmath8 orbital of co and the @xmath11 orbital of graphene is suppressed due to the pauli repulsion between graphene and the diffuse 4@xmath38 co orbital .",
    "interestingly , however , the surface repulsion favors some hybridization between the 3@xmath60 and 4@xmath38 co orbitals in the low - spin @xmath57 state , as indicated in table [ table2 ] . in the cases where the 4@xmath38 orbital is occupied ,",
    "the absence of the hybridization with the surface can be concluded by analyzing the occupancies of orbitals associated with the @xmath16 co orbital .",
    "lwdin population analysis@xcite as well as the occupation numbers of the natural orbitals@xcite show that at equilibrium distances , the co orbitals do not have contributions from / to the @xmath11 orbitals of graphene , so that the corresponding occupation numbers are close to integer values ( see table [ table2 ] ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that the binding of co with the nonempty @xmath30 orbital occurs only at the level of second - order perturbation theory and not in the pure casscf calculations , which also confirms that the interaction between co with a nonempty 4@xmath38 shell and graphene is of the weak vdw - type .",
    "the situation with the low - spin configuration ( @xmath58 ) is different . in this case , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ energies ] , the potential energy curve exhibits a marked linear dependence within the distance range of 2.8@xmath614.7   .",
    "this behavior suggests an ioniclike interaction between graphene and co in the @xmath58 state .",
    "lwdin population analysis shows that in this range , the occupation of orbitals changes from @xmath62 to @xmath63 , which means that some fraction of co electrons is transferred toward graphene .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the ionization energy lowering associated with the filling of the 3@xmath8 orbital .",
    "therefore , the observed ioniclike interaction can be explained as a result of a minor charge doping . at shorter distances , the @xmath58 adsorption curve exhibits a deep minimum typical for strong covalent interactions .",
    "in this situation , the hybridization between the 3@xmath8 co and @xmath11 surface orbitals is more likely since the 4@xmath38 co orbital is empty and the atom  surface repulsion is much weaker .",
    "as can be seen from table [ table2 ] , the natural orbitals of co in the @xmath58 state have noninteger occupation numbers , which suggests that there is an additional , many - body contribution to the co  graphene bonding .",
    "indeed , analysis of the wave function shows that the weight of the principal contribution in the casscf expansion , @xmath64 , is only 0.84 .",
    "the remaining part of the wave function is distributed over many configurations , which mainly corresponds to the hopping of electrons from the @xmath65 co orbital to the @xmath40 surface orbital .",
    "only one of these configurations reaches a contribution larger than 1% , namely , @xmath66 ( 4% ) .",
    "this allows us to conclude that the deep minimum observed in fig .",
    "[ energies ] for the adsorption of co in the @xmath58 configuration is attributed to the donation of the metal electrons to the ligand .",
    "the donation effect can be more clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ nat_orbs ] , where we show isosurfaces of the natural orbitals associated with the co 3@xmath67 and @xmath40 surface orbitals .",
    "since the donation process involves orbitals of specific symmetry ( @xmath65 ) , the degeneracy of the 3@xmath8 co orbitals is broken and an energy splitting is expected between different 3@xmath8 orbitals .",
    "we discuss this issue in the next section .",
    "it is also important to emphasize that the effect of considerable energy lowering of the 3@xmath184@xmath50 co state has an essential multiconfigurational character and thus can not be properly described at the single - determinant level .",
    "( adatom ) and @xmath68 ( surface ) orbitals .",
    "the numbers correspond to the natural orbital occupation numbers.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]      up to now , we have not paid any attention to the splitting of the 3@xmath8-orbitals , assuming that the electrons occupy the lowest energy states in a given configuration .",
    "it is clear , however , that when a tm atom approaches the surface , the crystal field tends to split the 3@xmath8-orbitals more strongly the smaller the distance .",
    "moreover , symmetry - specific hybridization discussed in the previous section suggests that these effects are not negligible . as we already mentioned , if a tm atom is deposited on a hollow site of graphene , its otherwise degenerate 3@xmath8-orbitals split into three groups according to the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 irreducible representations of the @xmath20 point symmetry .",
    "in what follows , we assume that the 3@xmath8-orbital splitting does not depend on the particular co state , i.e. , the same for different electronic configurations .",
    "to estimate the 3@xmath8-orbital splitting , we perform additional energy calculations for the 3@xmath184@xmath50 configuration of co , which correspond to different occupations of symmetry nonequivalent orbitals ( @xmath60 , @xmath69 , and @xmath67 ) .",
    "the potential energy curves for these states are given in fig .",
    "[ splitting](a ) .",
    "one can see that at distances larger than 2.5  , the energies are almost identical , i.e. , they do not depend on the particular occupation of the 3@xmath8 orbital .",
    "as the separation between co and the surface decreases , different orbital occupations result in different energies .",
    "this reflects the fact that the co orbitals interact differently with the surface , which is also clear from the hybridization between the 3@xmath67 co and @xmath70 surface orbitals , as discussed above . as a result of hybridization ,",
    "the states with fully occupied 3@xmath67 orbitals are much more favorable , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ splitting](a ) .",
    "energy differences between the states of different 3@xmath8 orbital occupations can be interpreted in terms of the simple crystal - field picture .",
    "if we express the energy of a particular state as a sum of one - particle energies , @xmath71 the effective crystal - field splitting parameters , @xmath72 , can be easily estimated from the total energies of different orbital occupations . in fig .",
    "[ splitting](b ) , we show these parameters as functions of distance . first , it should be noted that the orbital energy levels follow the order @xmath73 , which does not depend on the distance .",
    "this order is consistent with previous dft@xcite and many - body@xcite studies . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ splitting](b ) , the @xmath74 splitting parameter is relatively small , not exceeding 0.5 ev even at short distances . on the other hand ,",
    "the splitting between the @xmath23 and @xmath22 ( @xmath21 ) orbitals is significantly larger , reaching 4 ev at a distance of 1.6  .",
    "there are two main reasons that can account for the large splitting .",
    "the first arises from the direct interaction of co electrons with the surface , resulting in the hybridization and/or interorbital repulsion .",
    "the second can be attributed to the screening effects associated mainly with the reduction of the coulomb repulsion in the co 3@xmath8-shell .",
    "indeed , as we have shown before , the 3@xmath67 co orbital hybridizes with the surface , lowering the energy of this orbital . at the same time the hybridization causes delocalization of the electrons occupying this orbital ( see fig .  [ nat_orbs ] ) , which in turn reduces the coulomb repulsion and leads to further energy lowering . in the next section",
    ", we analyze these effects quantitatively based on a simple model hamiltonian .     configuration ; ( b ) energy differences between nonequivalent 3@xmath8-orbital levels of co ( the effective crystal - field splitting parameters ) calculated as functions of the adatom  surface separation ( see text for details ) .",
    "the splitting of the energy levels is shown schematically inside the lower panel.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "analysis of a many - body wave function in terms of the usual single - particle quantities is challenging .",
    "although the single - particle representation of many - body characteristics can in principle be constructed ( e.g. , in the many - body green s function formalism ) , the casscf wave function can not be readily mapped onto the single - particle picture . as a result , a number of physically relevant quantities , such as , for example , the density of states , are not available in the multireference methods . in this work , in order to more deeply understand the physics behind the adsorption of co on graphene , we map the casscf results onto a mean - field model . to this end",
    ", we consider a simple hamiltonian : @xmath75 here @xmath76 and @xmath77 label orbital indices and spin - projections for 3@xmath8 and 4@xmath38 electrons of co ( @xmath78 implies spin inversion ) , respectively , @xmath79 is the energy of the @xmath76 electron in the absence of electron - electron interaction , and @xmath80 is the particle number operator .",
    "the parameters @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 determine intraorbital and interorbital coulomb interactions as well as interorbital exchange interaction ( hund s rule coupling ) , respectively .",
    "the first term in this hamiltonian describes the one - electron contribution to the energy , including the interaction with the crystal field of the ligand .",
    "the rest represents the coulomb interaction hamiltonian in the kanamori parametrization,@xcite which describes the electron - electron interactions . in this parametrization ,",
    "the coulomb and exchange parameters for the 3@xmath8 electrons satisfy the relationship @xmath84 if the system is rotationally invariant .",
    "it should be noted that although the given hamiltonian does not explicitly contain atom  ligand interactions , these interactions are implicitly taken into account in the first term through the crystal - field splittings of the co orbitals . in turn , since the @xmath6 , @xmath85 , and @xmath7 parameters are defined only for the co part of the system , they should be considered as effective . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we also assume that the rotational invariance condition holds and the electron - electron interaction parameters have the same values for different 3@xmath8 orbitals ( i.e. , averaged over orbitals ) .",
    "finally , we neglect the intraorbital coulomb repulsion between electrons in the 4@xmath38 orbital ( @xmath86 ) , and interorbital 3@xmath84@xmath38 repulsions ( @xmath87 ) , taking into account the delocalized character of the 4@xmath38 orbital .",
    "the interaction between the 4@xmath38 and 3@xmath8 electrons is taken into account through the exchange interaction parameter @xmath88 .      since the hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( [ hamilt ] ) is diagonal , the energies of different atomic states of co can be readily expressed in terms of the parameters @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 , and the 3@xmath84@xmath38 orbital energies @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 . by comparing the energies of different states obtained in the model with the values obtained from the first - principles calculations ,",
    "the magnitude of the electron - electron interaction parameters can be extracted if the crystal - field splitting parameters , @xmath97 , are known ( see the appendix for the specific expressions ) .",
    "unfortunately , these parameters do not generally correspond to the effective @xmath98 parameters obtained in sec .",
    "iii  c. as we already discussed , apart from the direct interactions with the crystal field , the @xmath98 parameters may contain screening effects , enhancing the splitting due to additional lowering of the 3@xmath67 energy level . however , there is no straightforward way to establish a precise quantitative relationship between these two effects from first - principles calculations .",
    "the splitting in metal atoms due to the presence of neutral ligands is in general not large , especially for low - coordinated complexes such as atoms on surfaces .",
    "taking this fact into account , it appears reasonable to employ significantly smaller splittings than @xmath98 upon determination of the parameters of the model hamiltonian . to be more specific",
    ", we scale the effective splitting by a factor of 0.2 , so that @xmath99 . at the distance of @xmath100  ,",
    "this choice is close to the splitting obtained by means of the standard dft - gga calculations without using the @xmath6-corrections ( @xmath101 ev , @xmath102 ev).@xcite the use of smaller scaling factors does not significantly affect the results , while the larger factors lead to an unphysical ( nonmonotonic ) dependence of @xmath89 with distance .",
    "this can be considered as yet another criterion for the physically reasonable choice of the scaling factor .",
    "finally , we note that the uncertainty in the determination of the crystal - field splitting affects only the coulomb repulsion parameters in the short - distance range .     and @xmath91 ) and intraorbital coulomb repulsion ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the latter is shown for different splitting parameters @xmath103 ( see text for details ) .",
    "@xmath104 quantifies the pauli repulsion between the 4@xmath38 ( co ) and @xmath105 ( surface ) orbitals.@xcite the dashed lines mark the most favorable electronic configuration of co for a given range of distances ( in accordance with potential energy curves given by fig .",
    "[ energies]).,scaledwidth=49.0% ]      in fig .",
    "[ parameters ] , we show the calculated electron - electron interaction parameters as functions of the co - graphene distance . as one can see , the exchange coupling parameters ( @xmath88 and @xmath91 ) are almost constant and do not change over the entire range of distances .",
    "@xmath91 has a typical value commonly used in the lda+@xmath6 , and model hamiltonian calculations of tm compounds,@xcite and it amounts to @xmath1061.1 ev . as expected , the @xmath38-@xmath8 exchange interaction is significantly smaller ( 0.10.2 ev ) and does not play an important role in determining the electronic structure .",
    "in contrast , the intraorbital coulomb repulsion ( @xmath89 ) significantly decreases for shorter distances ( from 5.3 ev in the atomic limit to @xmath107 ev at a distance of 1.6  ) .    as we have shown in sec .",
    "iii  b the adsorption of co atoms on graphene differs from the adsorption of closed - shell systems because it involves transitions between different electronic configurations .",
    "the nature of these transitions can be interpreted in terms of the two primary effects : ( i ) coulomb repulsion between the electrons in the 3@xmath8 shell of co and ( ii ) electrostatic ( pauli ) repulsion between the 4@xmath38 ( co ) and @xmath11 ( graphene ) electrons .",
    "the first effect can be described by the @xmath89 parameter and its evolution with distance , while the second can not be captured by the model hamiltonian [ eq .  ( [ hamilt ] ) ] since it does not explicitly contain the surface energy levels .",
    "since the 4@xmath38@xmath11 orbital repulsion is essentially an electrostatic effect , it can be characterized by the 4@xmath38@xmath11 orbital splitting obtained by means of the simple hf approach @xmath108,@xcite whose variation with distance is also shown in fig .",
    "[ parameters ] .    analyzing the behavior of @xmath89 and @xmath109",
    ", one can see that both effects tend to move co electrons from the 4@xmath38 to the 3@xmath8 shell , which leads to the interconfigurational transitions of the tm atom upon adsorption . at large distances ,",
    "the variation of the two factors is small , and the most favorable configuration ( @xmath2 ) is governed by the strong repulsion in the 3@xmath8 shell . as the atom comes closer to the surface , the occupation of the 3@xmath8 shell becomes more favorable due to the reduction of the coulomb repulsion , whereas the occupation of the 4@xmath38 shell becomes less favorable due to the increasing pauli repulsion between the 4@xmath38 and @xmath11 electrons .",
    "this gives rise to the @xmath57 and @xmath4 configurations of co.    it is important to emphasize that both described effects have a non - negligible contribution and play an important role in the determination of the ground - state electronic configuration of the adsorbate . in comparison to the electrostatic repulsion between co and graphene ,",
    "the screening of the coulomb repulsion is essentially a correlation effect and thus represents a challenge for one - electron theories . in the next section ,",
    "we analyze the perspectives of the dft - based approaches in the description of tm atom adsorption on graphenelike structures .      as a final step ,",
    "it is interesting to draw a parallel between the results obtained in the present work and the results of previously reported dft studies .",
    "the standard gga calculations predict that the @xmath4 configuration is the ground state of co on graphene.@xcite the same configuration persists if a small @xmath6-correction ( @xmath110  ev ) is applied within the gga+@xmath6 method.@xcite the application of larger corrections ( @xmath13  ev ) yields a configuration close to @xmath57.@xcite finally , hybrid - functional calculations , which incorporate some fraction of the hartree - fock exchange energy , also predict the @xmath57 configuration for co on graphene.@xcite    as one can see , the electronic configurations of co obtained within the dft for small and intermediate values of @xmath6 ( 04 ev ) are consistent with the configurations that correspond to the same values of @xmath6 in the present work ( see fig .  [ parameters ] and the discussion above ) .",
    "this agreement justifies the use of on - site coulomb corrections in dft for the description of tm atoms on graphene .",
    "however , being significantly dependent on @xmath6 , the dft results are applicable only to a certain range of adsorption distances , while the entire adsorption energy curve can not be reproduced in a consistent way.@xcite this should be carefully taken into account in further studies , especially in the determination of ground - state configurations .",
    "the inability to describe the total potential energy curves for tm atoms on graphene within the dft also leads to difficulties in the determination of the binding energies . since an energy calculation of an isolated tm atom requires its own @xmath6 correction to be reliable , the comparison of energies [ e.g. , by using eq .",
    "( [ eq_ads ] ) ] becomes meaningless.@xcite on the other hand , if the same @xmath6 is used for the calculation of energies of the interacting and noninteracting systems , the binding energies are strongly overestimated due to an improper description of isolated tm atoms .",
    "another point , though less important , that prevents dft from giving accurate binding energies is the lack of nonlocal dispersion interactions in the standard dft approximations ( lda / gga ) .    in summary",
    ", the deficiency of the dft - based approaches with respect to the description of tm atoms supported on graphenelike structures can be attributed to their inability to handle electron correlations in a consistent and systematic way .",
    "in this work , we have applied multireference quantum chemical methods to the systematic investigation of adsorption of a single cobalt atom on graphene .",
    "it is found that the electron correlation effects play an important role in the adsorption .",
    "far from the surface , these effects are not significant and manifest themselves only in the weak attractive interactions of the van der waals type . in the vicinity of the surface ,",
    "the role of correlations is more pronounced and can be attributed mainly to the screening of the strong coulomb repulsion between electrons in the 3@xmath8 shell of co. due to the significant reduction of the coulomb repulsion , the co states with higher 3@xmath8 shell occupancy become more favorable at short distances . as a result ,",
    "the total adsorption energy curve of co on graphene is not monotonic and exhibits two minima , which correspond to the @xmath2 ( high - spin ) and @xmath4 ( low - spin ) configurations .",
    "therefore , two stable states of cobalt on graphene are predicted even for a single ( hollow ) adsorption site .",
    "we have shown that the calculated adsorption energies for co / graphene are much smaller ( @xmath111 ev ) than was reported previously by dft studies . the main reason is associated with the inability to properly describe the total adsorption energy curve for tm adsorbates within the dft .",
    "this , in turn , is related to the inconsistent treatment of the strong correlation effects , even in the presence of on - site coulomb corrections ( dft+@xmath6 methods ) .",
    "although only the case of the co adatom is considered in this work , we believe that the importance of the correlation effects is not specific only to the co adsorption .",
    "we expect qualitatively similar adsorption behavior for other tm atoms on graphene , particularly with respect to the interconfigurational transitions and relatively small binding energies . the determination of absolute values as well as the ground - state electronic configurations of different tm adatoms on graphene remains an open issue for further studies .",

    "<S> in this work , we investigate the adsorption of a single cobalt atom ( co ) on graphene by means of the complete active space self - consistent field approach , additionally corrected by the second - order perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> the local structure of graphene is modeled by a planar hydrocarbon cluster ( c@xmath0h@xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> systematic treatment of the electron correlations and the possibility to study excited states allow us to reproduce the potential energy curves for different electronic configurations of co. we find that upon approaching the surface , the ground - state configuration of co undergoes several transitions , giving rise to two stable states . </S>",
    "<S> the first corresponds to the physisorption of the adatom in the high - spin @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) configuration , while the second results from the chemical bonding formed by strong orbital hybridization , leading to the low - spin @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) state . due to the instability of the @xmath4 configuration , </S>",
    "<S> the adsorption energy of co is small in both cases and does not exceed 0.35 ev . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the obtained results in terms of a simple model hamiltonian that involves coulomb repulsion ( @xmath6 ) and exchange coupling ( @xmath7 ) parameters for the 3@xmath8 shell of co , which we estimate from first - principles calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that while the exchange interaction remains constant upon adsorption ( @xmath9  ev ) , the coulomb repulsion significantly reduces for decreasing distances ( from 5.3 to 2.6@xmath100.2 ev ) . </S>",
    "<S> the screening of @xmath6 favors higher occupations of the 3@xmath8 shell and thus is largely responsible for the interconfigurational transitions of co. finally , we discuss the limitations of the approaches that are based on density functional theory with respect to transition metal atoms on graphene , and we conclude that a proper account of the electron correlations is crucial for the description of adsorption in such systems . </S>"
