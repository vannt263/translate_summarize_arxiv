    "the tumour suppressor p53 is a transcription factor which functions to protect cells from malignant transformation @xcite .",
    "it is believed that most of the tumours are developed after the loss of p53 function @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that that p53 participates in various regulating processes , for example , cell cycle arrest @xcite , cell differentiation @xcite , cell senescence @xcite , dna repair @xcite , cell apoptosis @xcite etc .",
    "but when the cell experience stress , p53 induce both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by activating the p53 responsive target genes corresponding to the amount of stress @xcite . in normal stress free cell , it exhibits short half life time and usually maintained at low level through ubiquitin - dependent proteolysis @xcite .",
    "regulation of p53 protein is maintained by interaction with the mdm2 protein which is inhibitor of p53 @xcite .",
    "mdm2 is the antagonist of p53 and has two functions , first as a ubiquitin ligase for tumour suppressor p53 @xcite and secondly shuttles p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm , where degradation of p53 takes place @xcite .",
    "mdm2 itself is transcriptionally regulated by p53 , thereby establishing a negative feedback loop in which increased levels of p53 activate increased expression of mdm2 , which targets p53 for degradation @xcite .    several cellular stresses including dna damage , oncogene activation , hypoxia , cellular ribonucleotide depletion , mitotic spindle damage and nitric oxide ( no ) production activate p53 @xcite . upon exposure to stress , p53 is activated but can exist upto certain range of stress , and then stabilized predominantly by post - translational modification , such as phosphorylation events @xcite , acetylation @xcite or glycosylation @xcite .",
    "nitric oxide ( no ) is an important bioactive and messenger molecule involved in a variety of physiological processes of living system @xcite .",
    "no can be synthesized either by specific nitric - oxide synthases ( nos ) , which metabolize arginine to citrulline with the formation of no or by non enzymatic mechanisms which reduces nitrite to no @xcite .",
    "it is a membrane permeable and extremely short - lived molecule about half - life of 1 - 10 s @xcite . because of this permeability quality of no and its widespread availability",
    ", it can also function as a signalling molecule for cellular communication @xcite .",
    "cellular stress induce oscillations in the dynamics of p53 @xcite because stress affects p53 in two ways : firstly increasing p53 concentration in the cell and secondly enhances the transcription of genes regulated by dna sequences where p53 binds @xcite .",
    "no induces p53 accumulation and mdm2 degradation by phosphorylation@xcite .",
    "further , p53 phosphorylation initiates ubiquitin - dependent degradation of mdm2 and consequently regulates the stability of both p53 and mdm2 @xcite",
    ". however , single cell dynamics affected by no needs to be investigated in wider sense because of the two - fold role of no which acts as stress inducer and synchronizing agent that may lead the cell in various complex phenomena .",
    "further , when a group of such cells are allowed to interact via no , how do cells communicate via nitric oxide diffusion needed to be investigated in both theoretical and experimental situation .",
    "the present understanding of how cellular networks interact via direct and indirect interaction at molecular level still needs to be investigated extensively in order to capture complexities due to different levels of these interaction .",
    "the inter and intra molecular interactions and dynamics in heterogeneous , crowded molecular population and complex environmental fluctuations in a living cell is stochastic in nature @xcite .",
    "there have various approaches in the study of transport phenomena in finite system which show the possibility of retrieving macro level stochastic transport phenomenon in finite system from the dynamical studies in underlying @xmath7 system @xcite .",
    "further , radiation drive @xcite and damage - drive random signal @xcite on p53 is incorporated in the system systematically with intrinsic noise which exhibit oscillation in the dynamics and argued that this stress conditions in p53-mdm2 system drive the system to oscillation in p53 dynamics and noise in the stochastic dynamics dampen the p53 dynamics @xcite .",
    "it has also been studied noise induced oscillation in different systems , weak noise induced stochastic resonance @xcite , noise induced synchronization of coupled systems @xcite , noise induced phase transition and noise induced dynamical change @xcite .",
    "it is also shown in delay p53 regulatory model that the possibilities of inducing different p53 oscillatory dynamics interplay by noise and delay parameter @xcite .",
    "different approach to retrieve macroscopic dynamics of a system from the microscopic description of the hamiltonian system and general fluctuation - dissipation theorem was introduced to understand the role of noise which is capable of driving the system @xcite .",
    "the manifestations of sustained and damped oscillations , and their transition from one state to another in p53 dynamics induced by dna damage is systematically incorporated in the system @xcite and was found to be sensitive to the noise and delay parameter in the system model @xcite .",
    "delay induced oscillatory dynamics in gene expression @xcite , noise induced transition of oscillatory dynamics @xcite were also studied in the contex of stochastic systems .",
    "we address some of the interesting phenomena how do no drives the system at various states , plays various roles in regulating the system and process signal among the interacting systems .",
