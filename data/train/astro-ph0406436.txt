    "hundreds of open clusters are known in the galaxy . however , few among them are well characterized ( size , distance and reddening ) and fewer still are close enough to allow their stellar population to be investigated in detail . only the pleiades , the hyades , alpha per and a few other clusters have been systematically studied .",
    "our goal is to add other clusters to this list , and ic  2391 has been the focus of some of our efforts .",
    "ic  2391 is a young cluster with an estimated age , based on main sequence isochrone fitting , of 35 myr ( mermilliod 1981 ) .",
    "it is one of the nearest clusters , with a hipparcos distance modulus of @xmath3=5.82@xmath10.07 ( robichon et al .",
    "the interstellar reddening in its direction is very low , e(@xmath4)=0.04 or 0.06 , as estimated by becker & fenkart ( 1974 ) and patten & simon ( 1996 ) , respectively .",

    "y navascus , stauffer and patten ( 1999 , hereafter paper i ) , we presented some spectra of very low mass members of the cluster and a preliminary age estimate , 53 myr , based on the lithium depletion technique ( see stauffer et al .",

    "subsequently , in barrado y navascus et al .",
    "( 2001a , hereafter paper ii ) , we conducted an extensive photometric survey in the optical which yielded a substantial population of candidate members , both very low mass stars and brown dwarfs .",

    "1997 , see also cutri et al .",

    ", we described the results achieved by previous studies , both those papers that looked for new cluster members , more massive than those presented in paper ii , and those papers that studied the properties of true cluster members ( x  ray emission , rotation , lithium abundance and so on ) . since then , the only other works that have been published dealing with properties of members of this cluster are randich et al .",

    ", we present medium resolution optical spectra of a large number of candidate members discovered in paper ii and consider the membership of those candidates by studying their spectral types , h@xmath0 emission , sodium and lithium content ; derive again , in a more accurate way thanks to the larger number of objects , the location of the lithium depletion boundary of the cluster and hence its age ; and study the initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the spectra presented in this paper correspond to ic  2391 candidate members discovered by two different groups .",
    "the first ( generally brighter ) set was selected from patten & simon ( 1996 ) and patten & pavlovsky ( 1999 ) .",
    "the second group was extracted from paper ii , where we presented a large sample of low mass stars and brown dwarf candidates in the range 12 @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath5 21 , discovered in a deep optical and infrared photometric search .",
    "an initial subset of this survey was previously published in paper i , and it includes medium resolution spectroscopy , allowing the confirmation of the membership of most of them .",
    "these spectra were obtained in january 1999 with the ritchey - chrtien spectrograph at the cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) 4 m telescope and have a spectral resolution equivalent to 2.7  ( see paper i for details ) .    in the present study , we have carried out spectroscopic observations at medium resolution for a total of 44 candidate members . of these , 26 have been observed for the first time , while 18 were already analyzed in paper i. four out of these 18 have been reobserved .",
    "we especially selected those objects located around the lithium depletion boundary in a color - magnitude diagram ( generally very cool stars with masses slightly larger than the substellar limit at 0.072 m@xmath2 ) .",
    "figure 1 displays the @xmath7 magnitude versus the ( @xmath8 ) color in the cousins system . proposed ic  2391 members",

    "since the main goal of paper i was to establish the location of the ldb of the cluster , we did not publish all the spetra of that sample .",
    "we now present them in figure 2 .",
    "table 1 lists all the targets observed both in paper i except the three non - members analyzed there and in this paper , and includes accurate position ( from the 2mass survey , cutri et al . 2003 ) , optical as well as near infrared photometry , and information regarding how the spectra were collected ( telescope , instrument and date ) .      on 1999 march 10th and 13th , we collected multifiber medium resolution spectroscopy with the hydra  ii bench spectrograph at the ctio 4 m telescope under a shared risk program .",
    "the grating kpgl - d was used with the og-570 filter .",
    "the achieved resolution was 2.7  as measured in thar comparison spectra observed with the same set - up , and covering the spectral range 6300 - 8500  .",
    "the total exposure time was 11.5 hours , but we divided this time into 12 individual observations of 1 hour each ( except the last one , which lasted only 30 minutes ) during these two nights .",
    "each exposure was processed individually with the iraf package `` hydra '' .",
    "we used dome flats . after the extraction of each 1-d spectrum and its calibration in wavelength , we combined all the data corresponding to the same target into a final spectrum using a median algorithm in order to remove the hits by cosmic rays .",
    "no correction for telluric lines or instrumental profile was carried out .",
    "the final spectra can be seen in figure 3 .      during two different observing",
    "runs mainly devoted to other goals , we were able to complement the previous data with additional spectra collected at the magellan 6.5 m twin telescopes , located at las campanas observatory .",
    "the first campaign took place on 2002 december 11 - 14th .",
    "we used magellan i and the mike echelle spectrograph .",
    "mike provides spectral resolution that is actually too high for our purposes . for this reason and in order to improve the final signal - to - noise ratio , we degraded the resolution by rebinning the original data during the read - out to 2 and 8 pixels in the spatial and spectral directions , respectively , thus obtaining spectra with a resolution of 0.55  and complete spectral coverage of 4500- 7250  .",
    "four ic  2391 candidate member were observed with mike .",
    "we show the h@xmath0 order from these spectra in figure 4a .",
    "the second run took place on 2003 march 11th , and five additional candidates were observed , in this case with magellan ii and the b&c spectrograph , using the 1200 l / mm grating , yielding a 2.3  resolution .",
    "these last spectra can be seen in figure 4b ( probable non - members are not included in the diagram ) . in most cases , we took three individual exposures of 1200 seconds each , fully reduced each exposure separately , and then added together the three resultant 1d spectra at the end .",
    "additional details can be found in barrado y navascus et al .",
    "table 2 lists our results , including the derived spectral type , the measured h@xmath0 , sodium and lithium equivalent widths at 6563 , 8200 and 6708  , respectively , and the estimated effective temperature and lithium abundance .",
    "we used calibrations by bessell ( 1979 ) , leggett ( 1992 ) and basri et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and the ( @xmath9 color and the spectral types for the @xmath10 determination , and curves of growth by zapatero osorio et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for the lithium abundance .",
    "in the subsequent section we analyze and discuss these results .        for most of our targets ,",
    "spectral types were derived by comparison with spectral standards and/or other cluster members whose spectral types were known , in a similar manner to kirkpatrick et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and martn et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , using several spectral indices defined in the red side of the optical spectrum .",
    "these standards , whose spectral types go from k7 to m8 , were observed with the same spectral set - up . in the case of the echelle spectra collected with the mike spectrograph , we estimated the spectral types using the tio band - head which starts at 7053  .",
    "the depth of this feature is very sensitive to the effective temperature and it is an excellent spectral type indicator . in this case , in addition to our ic  2391 candidates , we observed standards of almost every spectral sub - class in the vicinity of m5 , with half a sub - class steps .",
    "a visual inspection , comparing ic  2391 members with the standard stars and verifying the spectral classification by direct comparison among the ic  2391 objects themselves , was also carried out .",
    "we believe that the uncertainty of the ic  2391 spectral types we have derived is of order half a subclass .",
    "five of our fainter targets ( @xmath6@xmath1120 mag ) , observed with hydraii , have spectra with a very low signal - to - noise and we have not attempted spectral classification .",
    "the spectral type of several of our brighter candidates is in strong disagreement with membership in the cluster , since they do not correspond to the value expected from the optical and infrared colors .",
    "this is the case of two stars ctio-002 and ctio-067 of k spectral type , probable background giants .",
    "these two stars , as well as the fainter objects , have no detectable h@xmath0 in emission or the line is seen in absorption ( see next subsection ) .",
    "the strength of the h@xmath0 emission can be used as a criterion to establish the membership of a cluster candidate .",
    "as stated before , two objects of k spectral type , warmer than the expected values from their colors , lack h@xmath0 emission and , therefore , they can be classified as likely non - members .",
    "the same argument is valid for three out of the five faint objects located at the end of the cluster sequence ( @xmath1220 ) , since we would have expected , at least , some emission .",
    "note , however , that this criterion is a statistical one , and membership can not be completely ruled out for these three objects or confirmed for the other two . in any case , the data suggest that there is a strong pollution rate for this range , about 60% .",
    "the comparison of the h@xmath0 distribution between clusters of different ages is displayed in figure 5 . for clarity",
    ", we have only included the cluster associated to the multiple star @xmath13 orionis ( wolk 1996 ) and the alpha per cluster .",
    "the data come from bjar et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ; barrado y navascus et al .",
    "( 2001c , 2002 , 2003 ) ; zapatero osorio et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , prosser ( 1992 , 1994 ) ; prosser & randich ( 1998 ) ; stauffer et al .",
    "we note that the @xmath13 orionis cluster , with an age close to 5 myr , has a significant number of stellar and substellar members with h@xmath0 far beyond the limits of the figure and might contain about 20 % of classical ttauri stars and substellar analogs ( barrado y navascus et al .",
    "2003 ; barrado y navascus & martn 2003 ; jayawardhana et al .",
    "2003 ) , which are characterized , among other things , by strong , asymmetric and broad h@xmath0 emission lines .",
    "we find that the distribution of h@xmath0 emission in ic  2391 is very similar to that for the somewhat older alpha persei cluster .",
    "only one star belonging to ic  2391 stands out in the figure , ctio-059 .",
    "this object is shown with the average value corresponding to the two observation we carried out in january 1999 at ctio , but in fact it was observed in two consecutive nights , and showed very different values ( 49.5 and 18.8  , see paper i ) .",
    "therefore , it seems that we detected a flare in that cluster member at that time .    figure 6 displays the h@xmath0 equivalent width versus time .",
    "there might be some variability on short time scales , within the same night .",
    "this variability could be related with rotation ( see , for instance , possible modulation due to rotation in ctio-038 or ctio-074 ) .",
    "variability on a longer time scale might be present too , but the dataset is too sparse and we can not confirm this at the present time . in any case",
    ", it would be very interesting to compare this information with light curves derived for the same objects .",
    "we have also measured the equivalent widths of the sodium doublet at 8200  .",
    "the strength of this alkali feature is sensitive to gravity ( see , for instance , martn et al .",
    "1996 ) . since ic  2391 members are much younger than field objects of similar spectral types , and should have larger radii , it is possible to use this characteristic as a youth indicator .",
    "all our targets but one ( ctio-046 ) have w(nai ) in agreement with a young age and , therefore , with membership .",
    "the large equivalent width measured in ctio-046 indicates that it is a more evolved object , which confirms our other indications that this star is probably not a member of the cluster .",
    "figure 7 and 8 display the area around the lii 6708  for all our spectra . the vertical dashed line",
    "indicate the location of this feature . in some cases ,",
    "the signal - to - noise is indeed good , and lithium is unambiguously detected ; see , for example , the cases of ctio-145 and 038 ( january 1999 ) , ctio-081 ( march 1999 ) , ctio-195 , 192 and 026 ( december 2002 ) and ctio-160 ( march 2003 ) .",
    "other cases , such as the two spectra of ctio-077 ( january and march 1999 ) , are less certain . in any case , the new data allow us a significant improvement in the determination of the location of the ldb ( section 3.2 ) .",
    "so far , including the data published in paper i , we have collected medium resolution spectroscopy for 47 candidate members ( out of the 206 identified in paper ii and a handful of brighter objects ) .",
    "the membership of another three ( ctio-040 , ctio-094 and vxr  27 ) was rejected in paper i. our targets were selected from those classified as probable and possible members in paper ii based on their optical and infrared photometry ( 132 objects in total ) . in that study , we estimated the pollution rate for that subsample candidates identified for the first time in paper ii as 25% . out of the 47 spectroscopically observed candidates ( including some vxrp and pp objects ) , nine have been classified as non - members ( the membership of three out of this nine , namely ctio-040 , ctio-094 and vxr  27 , was rejected in paper i ) and another five as possible members ( four from the ctio sample ) . of them ,",
    "38 objects ( the ctio - xxx ) were discovered and presented in paper ii and another six objects brighter come from previous studies ( from patten & simon 1996 and patten & pavlovsky 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , taking into account these 38 ctio objects including 4 possible members in the ctio sample- , and ctio-040 and ctio-094 the non - members discussed in paper i , the pollution rate is in the range 20 - 30 % for the ctio sample , depending on how the possible members are counted .",
    "the initial lithium depletion boundary for ic  2391 was located at @xmath6=16.2@xmath10.2 and @xmath14=1.91 in paper i. figures 7 and 8 contain the area around the lii6708  doublet for the bona fide members .",
    "the initial estimate of the ldb location is confirmed , but there are two stars pp07 and ctio-206 that show lithium in their spectra despite the fact they are brighter than the ldb .",
    "figures 9a and 9b display color - magnitude diagrams using optical and infrared data . we have used @xmath6 from paper ii in the y - axis for the first case and @xmath15 from 2mass in the second . in both cases these two stars are clearly above the ldb .",
    "actually , ctio-206 , the fainter of these two , might be a binary composed of two very low mass stars of almost the same mass , which would solve the puzzle .",
    "however , the other star , pp07 , is well above the ldb , by about 2 magnitudes . in both cases , the nai(8200 )",
    "equivalent width is in agreement with a young object .",
    "a similar situation has been discovered in the pleiades cluster by oppenheimer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and their interpretation was that the two supposed pleiades members ( hhj339=hcg332 and hhj409=hcg509 ) are , in fact , young interlopers in the line of sight .",
    "recently , deacon & hambly ( 2003 ) have derived membership probabilities for them .",
    "although they are very low ( p=0.155 and p=0.284 , respectively ) , these values are not conclusive , and membership can not be completely excluded .    the alternative would be that there is a mechanism which can prevent lithium depletion during the pre - main sequence phase in m dwarfs . note that some warmer alpha per and pleiades members ( k spectral type ) may inhibit lithium depletion using a mechanism related to rotation or magnetic field strength ( see , for instance , soderblom et al .",
    "1993 ; garca lpez , rebolo & martn 1994 ; randich et al . 1998 ; dantona et al .",
    "however , our medium resolution spectrum of pp07 does not seem to be broader than the rest ( although it would have been very difficult to detect anything with a projected rotational velocity of less than @xmath11100 km / s ) , and its activity in h@xmath0 is average compared with other cluster members of the same color or spectral type .",
    "another , more speculative , possibility is that these two objects are , in fact , bona - fide very low mass members of the cluster , which have recently swallowed a companion ( a brown dwarf ) .",
    "the sudden additional mass accretion could explain their location in these color - magnitudes diagrams and the strong lithium feature in the spectrum .",
    "this mechanism has been invoked to explain the tendency among planet - harboring stars to be metal rich ( santos et al .",
    "2001 ; gonzalez et al .",
    "possible evidence of planetary engulfment has been presented by israelian et al .",
    "( 2001 ; 2003 ) , although it has been called into question by others ( reddy et al .",
    "2002 ) .    in any event ,",
    "figure 9 clearly shows the lithium chasm ( i.e. , the lack of lithium for late k and early m in the cluster ) .",
    "figure 10 helps to determine with greater degree of accuracy the location of the chasm and , therefore , its cool border , the ldb . objects with lithium are displayed with solid symbols ( circles for our data , squares for data from randich et al .",
    "2001 ) , whereas open symbols represent objects without it ( triangles for our upper limits ) .",
    "the ldb keeps its location at @xmath16@xmath111.9 .",
    "our first detection of lithium is located at @xmath6=16.286 , whereas the last star without it has a magnitude of @xmath6=16.144 ( @xmath15=13.394 and 13.587 , respectively , if 2mass data are used instead ) .",
    "since the adopted distance and reddening are @xmath17=5.95@xmath10.10 and e(@xmath4)=0.06 , equivalent to a@xmath18=0.112 and a@xmath19=0.021 ( rieke & lebofsky 1985 ) , these values yield m(@xmath6)@xmath20 = 10.15 and m(@xmath15)@xmath20 = 7.52 .",
    "the distance yielded by hipparcos would locate the ldb 0.13 mag fainter than these values .",
    "the evolution of the lithium depletion boundary and the lithium chasm with age , from the empirical point of view , is illustrated in figure 11 , where we show a comparison with the three clusters where this type of data are available ( ic  2391 , alpha per and the pleiades ) .",

    "however , their spectra are not good enough to have a lithium detection beyond a doubt , which would confirm the substellar nature . only in one case , ctio-160 ( whose spectral type is m7 ) , is lithium clearly identified and its nature firmly established , making this object the first brown dwarf unambiguously identified in the ic  2391 cluster .",
    "note , however , that errorbars in the object photometry and the uncertainties in the models are large enough to change the classification of this object .",

    "( 1998 ) and the @xmath21 magnitudes . figure 13 depicts our results .",
    "we have assumed different ages , ranging from 25 to 50 myr ( these values are close to the turn - off and the ldb ages , respectively ) . in any case , when expressed as a power law , the index ( @xmath0=0.96@xmath10.12 ) does not depend on the age in this interval ( i.e. , the derived value is very similar when using these three ages ) .",
    "the mf is valid between a mass of 0.5 m@xmath2 and the substellar limit .",
    "below 0.072 m@xmath2 , there is a sudden drop , which might be partially explained by the lack of survey completeness beyond @xmath6@xmath1118.5 for cluster members ( 0.050 m@xmath2 for 50 myr isochrone from baraffe et al .",
    "however , we have detected a significant number of candidate members with magnitudes around @xmath6@xmath1120 .",
    "our medium resolution spectroscopy indicates that , despite the strong pollution in this range , about 60 % , some seem to be members of the cluster .",
    "therefore , the gap at @xmath6@xmath1119 , mass@xmath110.05 m@xmath2 might be real .",

    "( 2003 ) have pointed out that several young clusters show a lack of substellar members of m7-m8 spectral type , more or less in the same location as in the case of ic  2391 ( see the case of alpha per in the same diagram ) .",
    "they explain this fact as an effect of dust formation at this spectral type and its effect in the luminosity function as a new source of opacity , which would decrease the overall luminosity for the cooler objects . in any event ,",
    "the number of objects discovered so far in the ic  2391 cluster at the low end of the cluster sequence is too low to confirm this possibility .",
    "figure 13 also contains a comparison with several mass functions corresponding to young clusters of different ages , such as alpha per , the pleiades , and m35 all of them derived in the same manner ( see bouvier et al .",

    "the index of the mass function power law is very similar in all cases , except in the case of the low mass stellar members of m35 , a very rich cluster , where some mass segregation might have taken place due to its older age ( 175 myr in the turn - off age scale , barrado y navascus et al .",
    "by collecting medium resolution spectroscopy for a significant fraction of ic  2391 candidate members discovered in paper ii , we have established the membership for most of them via their spectral types and h@xmath0 emission properties , including dependence with spectral type and variability in a short time scale .",
    "in addition , we have studied the presence of the lithium doublet at 6708  , located the lithium depletion boundary in the color - magnitude diagram and , with the help of theoretical models , derived an age estimate , 50@xmath15 myr .",
