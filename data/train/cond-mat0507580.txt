    "the association of ultracold molecules from ultracold atomic gases using feshbach resonances was a major recent breakthrough in the field of cold molecules @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the method requires a slow magnetic - field ramp that crosses a feshbach resonance in the proper direction .",
    "the molecules can be dissociated back into unbound atom pairs by ramping the magnetic field back through the feshbach resonance .",
    "initially , the atomic gas is so cold that only @xmath2-wave collisions are relevant in the gas .",
    "the molecular bound state that causes the feshbach resonance is usually also an @xmath2-wave state , and the outgoing wave in the dissociation is again an @xmath2 wave .",
    "if one chooses a feshbach resonance where the molecular bound state is not an @xmath2-wave state , then one might wonder if outgoing waves other than the @xmath2 wave can be produced .",
    "of course , if the outgoing wave is as cold as the incoming one , the @xmath2 wave will dominate again .",
    "but if the magnetic - field ramp for the dissociation is fast , then kinetic energy can be added during the dissociation @xcite",
    ". it thus seems feasible to populate outgoing higher partial waves .",
    "this prompts many questions : if one creates a higher partial wave , will there still be an @xmath2-wave component ?",
    "do the different partial waves form a coherent superposition or an incoherent mixture ? what determines the relative phase and the branching ratio ? and",
    "how fast is the dissociation process ?",
    "are certain feshbach resonances better suited than others for creating a large fraction of a specific outgoing partial wave ?",
    "answering these questions is nontrivial and no theory has been developed on the subject , yet .",
    "the key to a theoretical description of the dissociation process lies in the observation that the dissociation is  half a collision \" . in a full collision ,",
    "two atoms come together and then separate again . in the association and dissociation",
    "using feshbach resonances , the experimenter can  freeze \" the population in the middle , after the atoms came together .",
    "he can even choose , how much time is spent between association and dissociation .",
    "still , the association and dissociation can be regarded as the first and second half of one collision .",
    "the concept of a half collision proved useful in other contexts before ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "unfortunately , the models developed there are not directly applicable here .",
    "the question is then how the dissociation can be linked quantitatively to scattering theory .",
    "the objective of the present paper is to establish this link .",
    "the motivation for this investigation comes from an experiment we performed recently , where dissociation into two partial waves , @xmath2 and @xmath1 , is observed @xcite .",
    "the experiment employs @xmath0rb , where the dissociation is particularly interesting because of the presence of a @xmath1-wave shape resonance .",
    "our theoretical studies in the present paper are geared towards explaining the results of this experiment .",
    "a very brief summary of the model was already presented in ref .",

    "[ sec - feshbach ] , magnetically tunable feshbach resonances in the collision of ultracold atoms are introduced .",

    "the stage is then set for sec .",

    "the problem of scattering two particles off one another is easily separated into center - of - mass and relative coordinates .",
    "the center - of - mass motion is trivial so that the problem is in the relative motion .",
    "the latter is equivalent to the scattering of one particle with the reduced mass @xmath3 off a potential @xmath4 .",
    "the relative motion is characterized by the wave vector @xmath5 .",
    "the corresponding kinetic energy is @xmath6 .",
    "scattering theory is usually formulated as a time - independent process with an incoming plane wave with @xmath5 pointing along the @xmath7-direction .",
    "one can show that the scattered wave at large radius falls off radially like a spherical wave .",
    "hence , the scattering wave function has the asymptotic form @xmath8 where @xmath9 are spherical coordinates .",
    "the scattering amplitude @xmath10 is related to the differential scattering cross section @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the differential solid angle .",
    "finally , the total cross section @xmath13 is obtained by integration of the differential cross section over the full solid angle .",
    "the task in scattering theory is to determine @xmath10 for a given potential @xmath4 .",
    "it is often useful to expand the scattering problem in terms of partial waves , i.e.  spherical harmonics @xmath14 .",
    "the result for the incoming plane wave is @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the spherical bessel function of order @xmath17 .",
    "the outgoing wave is also written as a sum of partial waves . in this paper , we restrict the scattering problem to the case , where all outgoing partial waves have @xmath18 . this is the case , e.g. , if the potential is invariant under rotations around the @xmath7-axis .",

    "as a first step , one solves the scattering problem for one incoming partial wave @xmath21 , where the asymptotic form of the scattering state is @xmath22 the outgoing partial waves have certain complex amplitudes .",
    "these amplitudes form the so - called @xmath23-matrix ( or scattering matrix ) .",
    "conservation of the number of particles implies that the @xmath23-matrix is unitary .",
    "in addition , realistic hamiltonians in atomic physics are invariant under time reversal , which implies that the @xmath23-matrix is symmetric .",
    "the second step is to superpose the incoming partial waves with suitable amplitudes to obtain an incoming plane wave .",
    "this yields @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the kronecker symbol .",
    "the task of calculating @xmath26 for a given potential @xmath4 is therefore replaced by the task of calculating the @xmath23-matrix .",
    "realistic potentials lead to selection rules for the angular momentum .",
    "therefore , there are usually only few non - vanishing matrix elements in @xmath23 .",
    "calculating the @xmath23-matrix is therefore often easier than calculating @xmath26 directly .",
    "if more than one scattered partial wave is populated , then the differential cross section shows a spatial interference pattern between the partial waves .",
    "cross section , however , shows no interference because @xmath27 .",
    "hence , @xmath28 when calculating differential or total cross sections , special attention must be paid in the case of indistinguishable particles , because then the two - particle wave function needs proper symmetrization .",
    "we restrict the rest of this paper to the scattering of identical bosons , where the cross sections double for the even partial waves and vanish for the odd partial waves .",
    "things simplify if the potential is spherically symmetric .",
    "the quantum number @xmath17 is then conserved , so that the @xmath23-matrix is diagonal .",
    "combined with unitarity this implies @xmath29 .",
    "all the information about the @xmath23-matrix is therefore in the phases of the diagonal elements and one defines the scattering phase @xmath30 for each partial wave by @xmath31 note that the scattering phase is real and only defined modulo @xmath32 .",
    "the connection between @xmath20 and the @xmath23-matrix simplifies to @xmath33 for identical bosons , the total cross section for the @xmath17-th partial wave is @xmath34 if @xmath17 is even ; and 0 otherwise .",
    "since @xmath30 is real , @xmath35 has an upper bound @xmath36 which is called the unitarity limit .",

    "[ sec - feshbach - general ] , the energy where @xmath37 is called the dissociation threshold .",
    "the behavior near threshold can often be expressed in terms of simple power laws .",
    "this was first systematically investigated by wigner @xcite .",
    "if the potential is spherically symmetric and has a long - range tail following a power law @xmath38 , then one can show that ( see p.  230 in ref .",

    "for @xmath42 it follows that , in the low - energy limit , @xmath2-wave scattering dominates over all other partial waves and that @xmath43 .",

    "if only @xmath2-waves are important , the collisions are called ultracold .      after performing the partial - wave expansion ,",
    "the remaining problem in scattering theory lies in the calculation of the @xmath23-matrix for a given potential .",
    "in essence , the schrdinger equation must be solved along the radial coordinate .",
    "various numerical methods have been developed to solve this problem .",
    "if more than one collision channel is involved , then coupling between the channels must be taken into account .",
    "the corresponding calculations are called coupled - channels calculations .    for atom - atom collisions ( except for atomic hydrogen )",
    "there is another problem : ab - initio calculations for the interaction potentials are not accurate enough to make realistic predictions for the cold - collision properties . as a solution , some quantities , such as the van - der - waals coefficient @xmath46 ,",
    "are treated as free fit parameters and experimental input is used to constrain the model , in order to obtain realistic predictions for the cold - collision properties ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "resonance scattering relies on the presence of a quasi - bound state .",
    "a quasi - bound state is a discrete state just like a bound state , but with an energy above threshold .",

    "examples for quasi - bound states are given in secs .",
    "[ sec - shape - resonance ] and [ sec - feshbach ] .",
    "the decay of the quasi - bound state is a dissociation process , because a quasi - bound system decays into two unbound particles .",

    ", some fraction of the incoming flux can make the transition to the quasi - bound state and subsequently decay back into unbound states",
    ". obviously , the probability to make this transition must depend on the energy difference between the incoming flux and the quasi - bound state .",

    "the physical meaning of @xmath94 as the magnitude of the wave vector requires it to be real and non - negative .",
    "but the continuation into the complex plane will offer additional physical insight , as we will see in the following . for simplicity",
    ", we consider only a spherically symmetric single - channel potential in this appendix .",
    "more details about the topics discussed in this appendix can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this discussion",
    ", one usually considers the jost function @xmath247 instead of the @xmath23-matrix . like the @xmath23-matrix , the jost function",
    "is also defined by the coefficients in the scattering state eq .",
    "( [ eq - define - s - matrix ] ) , but with a different normalization @xmath248 the jost function also has a unique analytic continuation into the complex @xmath94 plane . for most potentials ,",
    "@xmath247 is analytic everywhere in this plane , except for the negative imaginary axis .",
    "note that @xmath247 and @xmath249 can not both vanish for the same value of @xmath94 . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath247 can not vanish if @xmath94 is real .",
    "the @xmath23-matrix is easily obtained from the jost function : @xmath250 the kronecker symbol comes from our assumption of spherical symmetry . if @xmath94 is real , this implies @xmath251 , i.e.  unitarity .",
    "note that the @xmath23-matrix has a pole at @xmath94 if @xmath252 .",
    "in other words , poles of the @xmath23-matrix correspond to zeros of the jost function .",
    "if @xmath94 is real , the jost function can not vanish , so that all zeros of the jost function must lie either in the upper half - plane , i.e.  @xmath253 , or in the lower half - plane , i.e.  @xmath254 .",
    "we will now discuss what the physical meaning of the zeros of the jost function is .",
    "this depends on the half plane , in which the zero is .      for complex values of @xmath94 , eq .",
    "( [ eq - def - jost ] ) has one term that increases exponentially for large @xmath255 , and one term that decreases exponentially .",
    "we assume that there is a point @xmath256 in the _ upper _ half - plane with @xmath257 . here , eq .",
    "( [ eq - def - jost ] ) has only one term .",
    "this term falls off exponentially , because we assumed that @xmath256 is in the upper half - plane .",
    "hence , eq .  ( [ eq - def - jost ] ) is a normalizable eigenstate of the hamiltonian . in other words , this is a bound state .",
    "the bound - state energy is @xmath258 .",
    "since the hamiltonian is hermitian , this energy must be real . since @xmath256 is in the upper half - plane",
    ", it follows that @xmath259 with @xmath260 real and positive .",
    "the bound - state energy is then @xmath261 .",
    "conversely , one can show that if the hamiltonian has a bound state with angular momentum @xmath17 and energy @xmath262 , then @xmath263 .",
    "we now investigate what happens if the jost function vanishes at a point @xmath256 in the _ lower _ half - plane .",
    "again , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq - def - jost ] ) vanishes , but this does not result in a normalizable eigenstate , because the remaining term _",
    "increases _ exponentially for large @xmath255 . unlike before",
    ", @xmath256 does not have to lie on the imaginary axis .",
    "the jost function can thus have a large number of zeros everywhere in the lower half - plane .",
    "most of them are usually uninteresting .",
    "the only interesting ones are those , which lie close to the positive real axis because they can create resonances , as we will show now .",
    "the correspondence between resonances and zeros of the jost function in the lower half - plane is not so clear - cut one - to - one as in the case of bound states .",
    "still , when considering only those poles that lie close to the positive real axis and when ignoring some rather special cases ( see p.  241 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , one can think of this correspondence as being one - to - one .",
    "the linear approximation further below is usually made in terms of energy , rather than @xmath94 .",
    "obviously , one can substitute @xmath264 and obtain @xmath265 .",
    "care must be taken , because the transition from @xmath94 to @xmath51 is a two - to - one mapping , so that @xmath265 is a function on a two - sheeted riemann surface .",
    "@xmath253 corresponds to the first sheet of @xmath51 ( also called physical sheet ) and @xmath254 corresponds to the second ( or unphysical ) sheet of @xmath51 .",
    "if @xmath257 with @xmath256 in the lower half - plane , then @xmath265 has a zero on the unphysical sheet at @xmath266 .",
    "we assume that @xmath265 has a _ simple _ zero at @xmath267 , so that near @xmath267 we can use a linear approximation @xmath268 with a nonzero value of @xmath269 .",
    "we already mentioned that @xmath256 must lie just slightly below the positive real @xmath94 axis to create a noticeable resonance .",
    "this implies that @xmath267 also lies just slightly below the positive real @xmath51 axis .",
    "hence , there is some interval on the positive real @xmath51 axis , where eq .",
    "( [ eq - jost - approx ] ) is a good approximation . from eq .",
    "( [ eq - s - jost ] ) , one obtains @xmath270 for @xmath51 in this interval on the real axis .",
    "we abbreviate the prefactor that is independent of @xmath51 as @xmath271 and we split @xmath267 into its real and imaginary part @xmath272 here , @xmath49 and @xmath50 must be positive , because we assumed that the zero of the jost function lies slightly below the positive real @xmath94 axis .",
    "we thus obtain the breit - wigner expression @xmath273 the real and imaginary parts of @xmath267 are thus identified as the position and the width of the resonance .    with this approach to the breit - wigner form ,",
    "@xmath70 and @xmath50 are independent of @xmath51 .",
    "if the resonance is narrow , i.e.  @xmath50 is small , then this is a good approximation .",
    "broader resonances can be included in the formalism by allowing @xmath70 and @xmath50 to depend on @xmath51 .",
    "for a very broad resonance , the background scattering phase can change considerably over the width of the resonance , and it becomes questionable whether one really should regard this as a resonance ."
