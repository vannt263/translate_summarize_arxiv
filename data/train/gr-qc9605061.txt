    "recently , spatially homogeneous imperfect fluid models have been investigated using techniques from dynamical systems theory @xcite . in these papers , dimensionless variables and a set of dimensionless equations of state",
    "were employed to analyze various spatially homogeneous imperfect fluid cosmological models .",
    "it was also assumed that the fluid is moving orthogonal to the homogeneous spatial hypersurfaces ; that is , the fluid 4-velocity , @xmath0 , is equal to the unit normal of the spatial hypersurfaces .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor can be decomposed with respect to @xmath0 according to @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the energy density , @xmath4 is the thermodynamic pressure , @xmath5 is the bulk viscous pressure , @xmath6 is the anisotropic stress , and @xmath7 is the heat conduction vector as measured by an observer moving with the fluid .    in papers @xcite it was also assumed that there is a linear relationship between the bulk viscous pressure @xmath5 and the expansion @xmath8 ( of the model ) , and a linear relationship between the anisotropic stress @xmath6 and the shear @xmath9 ; that is , [ linear rel ] @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the bulk viscosity coefficient and @xmath12 denotes the shear viscosity coefficient",
    ". equations ( [ eckart ] ) and ( [ viscosity approx ] ) describe eckart s theory of irreversible thermodynamics .",
    "eckart s theory is a first order approximation of the viscous pressure @xmath5 and the anisotropic stress @xmath6 and is assumed to be valid near equilibrium @xcite .",
    "coley and van den hoogen @xcite and coley and dunn @xcite have studied the bianchi type v cosmological models using equations ( 1.2 ) as an approximation for the bulk viscous pressure and the anisotropic stress .",
    "they found that if the models satisfied the weak energy conditions , then the models necessarily isotropize to the future .",
    "belinskii and khalatnikov @xcite , with different assumptions on the equations of state , found similar behaviour present in the bianchi type i models .",
    "the addition of viscosity allowed for a variety of different qualitative behaviours ( different from that of the corresponding perfect fluid models ) .",
    "however , since the models studied in @xcite satisfy eckart s theory of irreversible thermodynamics @xcite , they suffer from the property that signals in the fluid can propagate faster than the speed of light ( i.e. , non - causality ) , and also that the equilibrium states in this theory are unstable ( see hiscock and salmonson @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , a more complete theory of irreversible thermodynamics is necessary for fully analyzing cosmological models with viscosity .    among the first to study irreversible thermodynamics",
    "were israel @xcite and israel and stewart @xcite .",
    "they included additional linear terms in the relational equations ( 1.2 ) . assuming that the universe can be modelled as a simple fluid and omitting certain divergence terms , the linear relational equations for the bulk viscous pressure , the heat conduction vector , and the shear viscous stress are @xcite : @xmath13[israel ] where @xmath14 is the projection tensor and @xmath15 .",
    "the variable @xmath16 represents the temperature , @xmath17 represents the thermal conductivity , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are proportional to the relaxation times , @xmath21 is a coupling parameter between the heat conduction and the bulk viscous pressure and @xmath22 is a coupling parameter between the shear viscous stress and the heat conduction .",
    "we shall refer to equations ( 1.3 ) as the truncated israel - stewart equations .",
    "these equations , ( 1.3 ) , reduce to the eckart equations ( 1.2 ) used in @xcite when @xmath23 .",
    "belinskii et al .",
    "@xcite were the first to study cosmological models satisfying the truncated israel - stewart theory of irreversible thermodynamics . using qualitative analysis ,",
    "bianchi i models were investigated with a relational equation for the bulk viscous pressure and the shear viscous stress of the form ( 1.3 ) .",
    "they also assumed equations of state of the form @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are constants and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are parameters . the isotropizing effect found in the eckart models no longer necessarily occurred in the truncated israel - stewart models .",
    "it was also found that the cosmological singularity still exists but is of a new type , namely one with an accumulated `` visco - elastic '' energy @xcite .",
    "similar to the work done by belinskii et al .",
    "@xcite , pavn et al .",
    "@xcite and chimento and jakubi @xcite studied the flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) models .",
    "they assumed the same equations of state as belinskii et al .",
    "@xcite , namely , but studied the models using slightly different techniques .",
    "chimento and jakubi @xcite also found exact solutions in the exceptional case @xmath29 ( which will be of interest later ) .",
    "they found that the future qualitative behaviour of the model was independent of the value of @xmath25 ; however , to the past , `` bouncing solutions '' and deflationary evolutions are possible @xcite .",
    "in addition , hiscock and salmonson @xcite investigated further generalizations of the truncated israel - stewart theory of irreversible thermodynamics .",
    "namely , they included the non - linear divergence terms in the relational equations ( 1.3 ) .",
    "we shall refer to such a theory as the `` israel - stewart - hiscock '' theory .",
    "hiscock and salmonson used equations of state arising from the assumption that the fluid could be modelled as a boltzmann gas . they concluded that when the eckart equations , ( 1.2 ) , or the truncated israel - stewart equations , ( 1.3 ) , were used , inflation could occur , but if the non - linear terms of the israel - stewart - hiscock theory were included , inflation was no longer present .",
    "this result led them to conclude that `` inflation is a spurious effect produced from using a truncated theory '' @xcite .",
    "however , zakari and jou @xcite also employed equations arising from the full israel - stewart - hiscock theory of irreversible thermodynamics , but assumed equations of state of the form and found that inflation was present in all three theories ( eckart , truncated israel - stewart , israel - stewart - hiscock ) .",
    "therefore , it appears that the equations of state chosen determine if the model will experience bulk - viscous inflation .",
    "romano and pavn @xcite also analyzed bianchi iii models using both the truncated israel - stewart theory and the israel - stewart - hiscock theory .",
    "they only analyzed the isotropic singular points , but concluded that the qualitative behaviour of the models in the two different theories was similar in that the anisotropy of the models dies away and the de sitter model is a stable attractor .    in this work",
    "we use equations of state that are dimensionless , and hence we are generalizing the work in @xcite in which viscous fluid cosmological models satisfying equations ( 1.2 ) were studied .",
    "one reason for using dimensionless equations of state is that the equilibrium points of the system of differential equations describing spatially homogeneous models will represent self - similar cosmological models @xcite .",
    "in addition , it could be argued that the use of dimensionless equations of state is natural in the sense that the corresponding physics is scale invariant ( see also arguments in coley @xcite ) .",
    "the intent of this work is to build upon the foundation laid by belinskii et al .",
    "@xcite , pavon et al .",
    "@xcite and chimento and jakubi @xcite , and investigate viscous fluid cosmological models satisfying the linear relational equations ( 1.3 ) .",
    "we will use dimensionless variables and dimensionless equations of state to study the qualitative properties of isotropic and spatially homogeneous cosmological models .",
    "in particular , we shall study this new `` visco - elastic '' singularity and we shall determine whether bulk - viscous inflation is possible .",
    "we will also determine if there is a qualitative difference between these models and the models studied by burd and coley @xcite where the eckart equation was assumed .    in section  [ ii ]",
    "we define the models and establish the resulting dynamical system . in section  [ iii ]",
    "we investigate the qualitative behaviour of the system for different values of the physical parameters . in section  [ iv ]",
    "we discuss and interpret our results and in section  [ v ] we end with our conclusions . for simplicity",
    "we have chosen units in which @xmath30 .",
    "in this paper we assume that the spacetime is spatially homogeneous and isotropic and that the fluid is moving orthogonal to the spatial hypersurfaces .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor considered in this work is an imperfect fluid with a non - zero bulk viscosity ( that is there is no heat conduction , @xmath31 , and no anisotropic stress , @xmath32 ) .",
    "the einstein field equations ( @xmath33 ) and the energy conservation equations ( @xmath34 ) can be written as ( see burd and coley @xcite ) : @xmath35 where @xmath8 is the expansion and @xmath36 is the curvature of the spatial hypersurfaces . if the curvature is negative , i.e. , @xmath37 , then the frw model is open , if @xmath38 then the model is flat , and if @xmath39 then the frw model is closed .",
    "assuming that the energy density , @xmath3 , is non - negative , it is easily seen from that in the open and flat frw models the expansion is always non - negative , i.e. @xmath40 , but for the closed frw models the expansion may become negative .",
    "( great care must be taken in this case because the dimensionless quantities that we will be using become ill - defined at @xmath41 . )",
    "we can obtain an evolution equation for @xmath5 by solving for @xmath42 , @xmath43    now the system of equations defined by equations , , and constitute a dynamical system of the form @xmath44 , where @xmath45 .",
    "this system of equations is invariant under the mapping ( see coley and van den hoogen @xcite ) @xmath46 and this invariance implies that there exists a symmetry in the dynamical system @xcite .",
    "therefore , we introduce new dimensionless variables @xmath47 , @xmath48 and a new time variable @xmath49 as follows : @xmath50 and consequently the raychaudhuri equation , , effectively decouples from the system .    in order to complete the system of equations",
    "we need to specify equations of state for the quantities @xmath4 , @xmath18 , and @xmath11 . in principle equations of state",
    "can be derived from kinetic theory , but in practice one must specify phenomenological equations of state which may or may not have any physical foundations . following coley @xcite , we introduce dimensionless equations of state of the form [ equations of state ] @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath27 , and @xmath53 are positive constants , and @xmath54 , @xmath25 , and @xmath55 are constant parameters ( @xmath47 is the dimensionless density parameter defined earlier ) . in the models under consideration , @xmath8 is positive in the open and flat frw models , thus equations ( 2.6 ) are well defined . in the closed frw model",
    "the expansion could become zero , in which case these equations of state break down .",
    "however , we can utilize these equations to model the asymptotic behaviour at early times , i.e. , when @xmath56 .",
    "the most commonly used equation of state for the pressure is the barotropic equation of state @xmath57 , whence @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( where @xmath60 is necessary for local mechanical stability and for the speed of sound in the fluid to be no greater than the speed of light ) .",
    "we define a new constant @xmath61 . using equations ( 2.5 ) and ( 2.6 ) , we find that equations and reduce to [ sys of equations ] @xmath62 , \\\\",

    "the equilibrium points of the above system all represent self - similar cosmological models , except in the case @xmath67 .",
    "if @xmath68 , the behaviour of the equations of state , equation ( 2.6 ) , at the equilibrium points , is independent of the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath55 ; namely the behaviour is @xmath69 therefore , natural choices for @xmath25 and @xmath55 are respectively @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "we note that in the exceptional case @xmath67 , there is a singular point @xmath72 which represents a de sitter solution and is not self - similar .",
    "( this is also the case in the eckart theory as was analyzed by coley and van den hoogen @xcite . )    to further motivate the choice of the parameter @xmath55 , we consider the velocity of a viscous pulse in the fluid @xcite , @xmath73 where @xmath74 corresponds to the speed of light . using and equations ( 2.6 ) , we obtain @xmath75 now , if @xmath76 then not only do we obtain the correct asymptotic behaviour of the equation of state for the quantity @xmath18 but we are also allowed to choose @xmath77 since then the velocity of a viscous pulse is less than the velocity of light for any value of the density parameter @xmath47 .",
    "thus in the remainder of this analysis we shall choose @xmath76 . in order for the system of differential equations ( 2.7 ) to remain continuous everywhere ,",
    "we also assume @xmath78 .",
    "we now study the specific case when @xmath79 . in this case",
    "there are three singular points , @xmath80 where @xmath81    the point @xmath82 has eigenvalues @xmath83 this point is either a saddle or a source depending on the value of the parameter , @xmath84 ; @xmath85 if @xmath86 , then the point is a saddle point and if @xmath87 , then the point is a source . if @xmath88 ( the bifurcation value ) , then the point is degenerate ( discussed later ) .    the point @xmath89 has eigenvalues @xmath90 if @xmath87 , then the point @xmath89 is a saddle point and if @xmath86 , then the point @xmath89 is a source . if @xmath88 ( the bifurcation value ) , then the point @xmath89 is degenerate ( discussed later ) .",

    "these invariant sets represent the eigendirections at each of the singular points [ see also [ appendix 1 ] ] .    in order to sketch a complete phase portrait",
    ", we also need to calculate the vertical isoclines which occur whenever @xmath98 . from ( 2.7 ) we can see that this occurs either when @xmath64 or when @xmath99 .",

    "we do this by first converting to polar coordinates and then compactifying the radial coordinate .",

    "this is a case of particular interest since it represents the asymptotic behaviour of the frw models for any @xmath25 and @xmath55 ( since at the singular points the viscosity coefficient behaves like @xmath120 and the relaxation time like @xmath121 ) .",

    "it is possible to reconcile the truncated and full theories , at least near to equilibrium , by using a `` generalized '' non - equilibrium temperature and pressure defined via a modified gibbs equation in which dissipation enters explicitly @xcite .",
