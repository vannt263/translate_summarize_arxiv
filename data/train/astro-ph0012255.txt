    "holmberg ii ( hereafter referred to as hoii ) is one of the most famous examples of a dwarf galaxy with a disrupted neutral ism as traced by observations of neutral hydrogen ( hi , puche et al .",
    "the distribution its ism is characterized by holes which are present across the entire face of the galaxy . huge cavities of kpc extent are found even outside hoii s stellar population .",
    "puche et al .",
    "( 1992 ) compiled a catalog of individual hi holes : their diameters range between 100  2000 pc , the radial velocities indicate that the holes are still expanding .",
    "this provides a rough estimate of the ages of the holes of about @xmath2 to @xmath1 years . since the work done by puche et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , hoii has been studied in many wavelength ranges by a number of authors ( radio continuum : tongue & westpfahl , 1995 ; optical : rhode et al . , 1999 ; fuv : stewart et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "the presence of the cavities is usually linked to the stellar activity within their centers ( the `` standard picture '' ) : strong winds of young o and b  stars create individual bubbles of a few pc size while subsequent supernova events can create cavities of few tens to hundreds of pc extent ( e.g. , weaver et al . 1977 ) .",
    "observations indicate that in dwarf galaxies the expanding shells and holes can grow older and to much larger sizes compared to massive spiral galaxies .",
    "this finding can be attributed to the shallow gravitational potential and the absence of differential rotation in dwarf galaxies ( walter & brinks 1999 ) .",
    "x - ray observations may serve as a new tool to check the standard picture : the hot  gas interior of the is traced by soft x - emission which is emitted by the plasma ( see sec .",
    "harder x - ray emission originating from point sources may indicate old stellar endpoints such as supernova remnants , low and high mass x - ray binaries and pulsars on timescales @xmath3yrs ( this will be discussed in sec .  1.2 ) .",
    "ray observations therefore have the power to trace the global star ",
    "formation history way further back than it is possible with , e.g. , h@xmath4 or fuv observations ( stewart et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the cooling time of the plasma can be estimated by @xmath5 to be some @xmath6 yrs , assuming a temperature of @xmath7 k and a typical electron density of about @xmath8 ( see e.g. walter et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) . in the cases of the largest holes ( with radii larger than the one@xmath9scale  height of the disk ",
    "300pc in the case of hoii ) the expanding bubble will break out and the hot gas interior will be vent out to the halo . in the case of the smaller , still confined holes , the interior x  ray emission should be detectable if the column density of the approaching shell does not succeed values of @xmath10@xmath11 ( when the soft x  emission of the hot gas is intrinsically absorbed by the shell ) .",
    "pulsars , cooling neutron stars as well as x - ray binaries are stellar end - points and may be observable within the interior of the holes .",
    "their x - ray luminosities range between @xmath12@xmath13 , corresponding to an x - ray flux ( adopting a distance to hoii of 3.05mpc , hoessel et al .",
    "1998 ) of @xmath14@xmath15 , which is detectable with the pspc detector in deep pointed observations like the one discussed here .    in this paper",
    "we present our analysis of three pointed pspc observations of ho ii . in sec .  2 we present the data reduction and analysis .",
    "our results are compiled in sec .",
    "we extracted 3 pointed pspc observations towards hoii from the archive in munich .",
    "the pspc data were analyzed by us using the exsas software package ( zimmermann et al .",
    "all three observations were merged into a single photon event file .",
    "the total integration time of the merged pspc data is 22566 sec , making hoii one of deepest studied dwarf galaxies by .",
    "the photon events were binned into the standard kev ( c - band ) , kev ( m - band ) , 1.5 kev ( j - band ) energy bands and a total energy band , all were corrected for vignetting . within the area of an individual x - ray source towards hoii ( 3.5 @xmath16 fwhm psf ) , the absorbed x - ray flux of the extragalactic x - ray background ( xrb ) is about @xmath17 . to evaluate this flux limit we assumed that the extragalactic xrb is only attenuated by the ism of the milky way .",
    "unfortunately , there is no straight forward way to differentiate between an x - ray source belonging to hoii or an accidental positional coincidence with an xrb source .",
    "however , we can reduce this ambiguity by studying a particular x - ray source and searching for counterparts in other wavelengths using supplementary data ( which is what we will do in the following , the complete analysis will be presented elsewhere , kerp et al . , 2001 , in prep . ) .      the absorbed 3-@xmath9 x - ray flux level across the entire energy band is @xmath18 . assuming a distance to hoii of 3.05 mpc and a galactic x - ray attenuating column density of about @xmath19(hartmann & burton 1997 ) , we derive a detection luminosity threshold of @xmath20 .",
    "only very young supernova remnants or x - ray binaries are typical sources with luminosities exceeding this threshold .",
    "the presented pspc x - ray data therefore traces only two extreme populations of the star formation in hoii : the actual ( @xmath21 yr , i.e. young supernovae ) or the very old population ( @xmath22 yr , pulsars , x - ray binaries ) .",
    "the intermediate star population can be traced via and far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) observations ( stewart et al . 2000 ) .",
    "combining all data provides a unique insight on the star formation history of hoii during the last 100 myrs .",
    "in total we detected 31 significant x - ray sources within the extent of the distribution of hoii . to avoid any confusion with bright extragalactic x - ray background sources",
    ", we decided to further study only those 13 x - ray sources which are identified in at least one additional frequency range .",
    "the supplementary data give us also a better handle to constrain the nature of the x - ray sources in question .",
    "we tried to constrain the x - ray emission process of the 13 sources by studying the spectral properties .",
    "because most of the x - ray sources are rather faint , it is impossible to extract a significant x - ray spectrum from the data . to constrain the x - ray spectrum we produced a multi source x - ray hardness ratio color - color diagram , which is described in detail below .      to identify the emission mechanism of an x - ray source",
    "the standard procedure is to extract a spectrum from the pspc data . in case of faint x - ray sources ( @xmath23 )",
    " which are discussed here  the insufficient signal  to  noise ratio does not allow to apply this standard procedure .",
    "however , the count rates within the broad energy bands contain significant information on the x - ray source spectrum .",
    "we therefore calculate the x - ray hardness ratios to constrain the emission process . in fig .  2 we plotted the hardness - ratio 1 ( hr1 ) ( @xmath24 ) versus the hardness - ratio 2 ( hr2 ) ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the hardness ratios depend strongly on the intrinsic source spectrum but also on the amount of x - ray attenuating matter along the line of sight",
    ". the stronger the photoelectric absorption the harder the resulting x - ray spectrum .",
    "each individual x - ray spectrum has its own trajectory in this x - ray hardness ratio color - color diagram .",
    "this is similar to the change of the stellar color  reddening  of an optical color - color diagram by dust attenuation . in fig .  2 we plotted trajectories for power - law ( solid lines ) and thermal plasma spectra ( dashed lines ) with increasing column density as parameter ( from left to right @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) .",
    "the most upper and left trajectory of each hardness ratio trajectory represents the the unabsorbed situation .",
    "the labeled trajectories ( line with @xmath30 , representing the absorbing foreground column density belonging to the milky way ) give the spectral slope in case of the power - law spectra ( solid lines ) and the log(@xmath31[k ] ) in case of the thermal plasma spectra .",
    "therefore a soft x - ray spectrum source can be found in the lower left part of the x - ray hardness ratio color - color diagram , whereas highly absorbed or hard x - ray sources populate the upper right part of the diagram .",
    "the harder the x - ray spectrum , the larger @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "all these trajectories , with @xmath34 as parameter , are based on the assumption that the x - ray sources of interest are at least attenuated by the interstellar medium belonging to the milky way ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the x - ray hardness ratio color - color diagram offers a very sensitive tool to get information on the x - ray emitting process even of faint sources .",
    "the faintest source analyzed has an x - ray flux of only @xmath36",
    ".    however , the x - ray data alone do not allow a unique determination of the nature of the sources .",
    "combining all available information from the x - ray to the low - frequency radio regime , we tried to constrain the emission process of each particular x - ray source .",
    "five x - ray sources are located within the interior of the holes cataloged by puche et al .",
    "two of them appear to be associated with supernova remnants ( # 23 and # 31 ) , one can be identified as young star - forming regions ( # 20 ) . the remaining two are most likely stellar end - points , in particular lmxbs ( # 25 and # 26 ) .",
    "four of the selected x - ray sources are located towards high column density regions of hoii .",
    "one may be associated with a stellar cluster hosting developed stars with bright x - ray emitting coronae ( # 8) , two with young star forming regions ( # 12 and # 24 ) and one with an x - ray binary system ( # 29 ) .",
    "finally , we found 4 x - ray sources which are located far outside the stellar body and close to the rims of the column density distribution of hoii .",
    "all these sources represent most likely stellar end - points , either supernova remnants or x - ray binaries .",
    "some of the regions of hoii are associated with x - ray emission , however there is no strong correlation .",
    "we should keep in mind , however , that the x - ray detection threshold is very high , which leads to selecting only the brightest star forming regions .",
    "the much more sensitive and observation will overcome this instrumental limitation .",
    "lmxbs ( tracers of the past star formation ) are also found well outside the stellar body of hoii ( # 25 , # 26 and # 29 ) .",
    "this indicates past star formation at large galactocentric radii .",
    "the giant holes may therefore be indeed residuals from energetic events associated with the stellar activity of hoii in the past ( on timescale @xmath37 yrs ) .",
    "this would imply that lmxb are good markers for sites of old star formation . because they are faint in the optical they are hardly detectable even with the _ hubble space telescope _ at mpc distances . in the x - ray domain",
    "however , they are prominent and bright x - ray sources with a hard spectrum .",
    "the pspc data presented here is unfortunately not sensitive enough to compile a complete inventory of lmxbs in hoii .",
    "however with and lmxbs will be easy to detect ( even in case they are deeply embedded lmxbs within the ism of the host galaxy ) .",
    "this opens the exciting possibility to search for lmxbs within the todays `` empty '' holes of hoii and other dwarf galaxies .",
    "in fact , only a few tens of ksec integration time with is needed to reach the necessary flux level .",
    "the most critical step is to separate their x - ray emission from that of xrb sources which is unrelated to the galaxy of interest .",
    "the improved spectral resolution of the ccd ",
    "detectors on - board of and will provide additional information to improve the presented x - ray hardness color  color diagram to identify the nature of the x - ray sources ."
