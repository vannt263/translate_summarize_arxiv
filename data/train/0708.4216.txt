    "compact stars provide natural laboratories for the exploration of baryonic matter at high densities , well exceeding in their centres the nuclear saturation density of @xmath2 @xmath3 , where nuclear matter properties can be calibrated in terrestrial experiments with atomic nuclei .",
    "recently , results from observations of compact star properties have been reported which have the potential to provide serious constraints for the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "in particular , the high mass of @xmath4 for the pulsar j0751 + 1807 in a neutron star - white dwarf binary system @xcite and the large radius of @xmath1 km for the isolated neutron star rx j1856.5 - 3754 ( shorthand : rx j1856 ) @xcite point to a stiff equation of state at high densities .",
    "measurements of high masses are also reported for compact stars in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) as , e.g. , @xmath5 for the compact object in 4u 1636 - 536 @xcite . for another lmxb , exo 0748 - 676 , constraints for the mass @xmath6 _ and _ the radius @xmath7 km",
    "have been reported @xcite .",
    "the status of these data is , however , unclear since the observation of a gravitational redshift @xmath8 in the x - ray burst spectra @xcite could not be confirmed thereafter despite numerous attempts .",
    "measurements of rotation periods below @xmath9 ms as discussed for xte j1739 - 285 @xcite , on the other hand , would disfavor too large objects corresponding to a stiff eos and would thus leave only a tiny window of very massive stars in the mass - radius plane @xcite for a theory of compact star matter to fulfill all above mentioned constraints .",
    "[ ht ]    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "the evidence for neutron stars with high mass ( @xmath0 for psr j0751 + 1807 ) and large radii ( @xmath1 km for rx j1856 - 3754 ) rules out soft equations of state and has provoked a debate whether the occurence of quark matter in compact stars can be excluded as well . in this contribution",
    "it is shown that modern quantum field theoretical approaches to quark matter including color superconductivity and a vector meanfield allow a microscopic description of hybrid stars which fulfill the new , strong constraints .",
    "the deconfinement transition in the resulting stiff hybrid equation of state is weakly first order so that signals of it have to be expected due to specific changes in transport properties governing the rotational and cooling evolution caused by the color superconductivity of quark matter .",
    "a similar conclusion holds for the investigation of quark deconfinement in future generations of nucleus - nucleus collision experiments at low temperatures and high baryon densities @xcite , such as cbm @ fair .",
    "we thank our colleagues who have contributed to the results reported in the present work , either with their discussions or by providing us with their data .",
