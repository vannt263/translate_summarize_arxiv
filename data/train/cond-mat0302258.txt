    "there exists a widespread understanding in scientific community that the moment of rupture in heterogeneous materials is somewhat similar to a critical point .",
    "the fracturing process is then a kind of a second - order phase transition [ 2,4 ] .",
    "this underlies the intuitive assumption which compares global failure in disordered materials at mesoscopic scale with percolation at microscopic scale .",
    "so , as percolation , global failure is assumed to be a critical phenomenon . the fracturing process is then classified as a self - organised random irreversible process .",
    "extensive numerical simulations and experimental measurements have confirmed this conclusion .",
    "this concerns the global failure of materials as well as earthquakes [ 9 ] , since an earthquake can also be considered as a global failure of a large material mass .",
    "the classical power law , defining the energy release rate , has been verified in the critical region , close to the time of either a large earthquake or a global materials failure .",
    "the related critical exponent is , in general , a complex number , which is due to taking into account long - range elastic interactions transported by stress fields around defects and cracks .",
    "the imaginary part of the exponent gives rise to the so - called log - periodic corrections which have been identified quite early in renormalization group solutions for critical phase transitions [ 7,10 ] .",
    "experimental results of acoustic emission measurements and seismograms unambiguously revealed the existence of oscillatory corrections before materials fractures and earthquakes , respectively [ 1,10 ] .",
    "if one would know the general law describing this acoustic emission , one would be able to make an early prediction of the global failure in heterogeneous materials .",
    "it is a principal , not yet solved problem , to find such a general law , which would be valid not solely in the asymptotic vicinity of the critical point , but in the whole interval of pressures or times , both near the critical point of failure as well as far from it . and",
    "this is the main aim of the present paper to suggest a mathematically grounded derivation for such a law and to confront it to available experimental data [ 5 ] . for this purpose",
    ", we employ the recent progress in the self - similar approximation theory [ 1218 ] which has been successfully applied to the theory of critical phenomena and to time series forecasting [ 1921 ] .",
    "we would like to stress here that this theory is general and can be used for any given series of experimental data , whether this concerns phase transitions , financial markets , or any other series .",
    "let us be interested in the behaviour of the energy release @xmath2 as a function of pressure @xmath3 , considered between @xmath4 , i.e. at the initial stage when the very early damages occur , and up to the point @xmath5 of global failure .",
    "note that @xmath3 refers to fracturing under applied spatially uniform loading , as in experiments where water pressure inside a spherical tank increases up to the material failure .",
    "experimentally , the applied pressure is usually increased linearly with time .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath2 at the vicinity of the critical point of rupture is @xmath6 \\ ; , \\ ] ] as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are parameters ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the real and imaginary parts , respectively , of the so - called critical complex exponent ) .",
    "the problem is how to find the behaviour of @xmath2 in the whole range @xmath12 ?",
    "here we consider the case of one variable , pressure . a more general loading , involving not one variable , like @xmath3 , but several variables can also be treated by the theory . however , before being involved in such generalisations , we would like to show on a simpler example how to accomplish the extrapolation .",
    "our main aim in this letter is to demonstrate the general possibility of realising such an accurate extrapolation for the energy release .",
    "let us transform eq .",
    "( 1 ) by introducing the dimensionless variable @xmath13 , @xmath14 and the reduced energy release @xmath15 which is a dimensionless function .",
    "then , expansion ( 1 ) takes the form @xmath16\\ ] ] whose parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 can be easily expressed through @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath11 , and @xmath9 .",
    "note that function @xmath24 can not be expanded in powers of @xmath25 near zero .",
    "therefore , expansion ( 2 ) can be treated as a generalised asymptotic series , as defined by poincare [ 8 ] , with @xmath24 considered as a coefficient . employing the self - similar approximation theory [ 1221 ] , the asymptotic series ( 2 )",
    "can be extrapolated to @xmath26 \\ ; , \\qquad c(x ) = [ 1 + \\mu\\cos(\\omega\\ln x + \\beta)]\\ ; \\tau \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath27 has to be defined from an optimization or boundary condition . as is clear , the boundary condition @xmath28 is not convenient here , leading to large errors in defining @xmath27 because of the physical impossibility to determine the very early precursors with a high accuracy .",
    "a more judicious choice is to consider a global physical quantity . in the same way as treating @xmath2 as the integrated energy release rate",
    ", we may define @xmath29 as the integral energy release @xmath30 .",
    "given @xmath31 , the parameter @xmath27 then can be defined from the sum optimization rule @xmath32 in general , the lower limit in the integral ( 4 ) can pertain to the whole interval [ 0,1 ] .",
    "in reality , the trustful experimental data are available only below @xmath20 .",
    "one has to choose the data at the highest available pressure , so that the lower limit in the sum rule ( 4 ) be sufficiently small .    in this way",
    ", the self - similar approximant ( 3 ) becomes @xmath33 \\ ; \\tau x^\\alpha \\right \\}\\ ] ] with @xmath27 given by the sum rule ( 4 ) .",
    "note that this formula contains the same number of parameters as the initial formula ( 1 ) .",
    "returning , with the help of relations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , to the energy release , we come to the formula @xmath34 which extrapolates @xmath2 for the whole interval @xmath35 .",
    "it is worth stressing that the law ( 6 ) is obtained as a self - similar extrapolation of the acoustic emission signals observed at the vicinity of the rupture .",
    "another possibility would be to base this kind of extrapolation , starting from the signals existing at the initial stage of the process , being yet very far from the rupture .",
    "this latter way was used by gluzman et al . [ 3 ] , who started with a given polynomial expansion at the early time of acoustic emissions , treating the power law behaviour close to rupture as a boundary condition . to our mind , this opposite approach has two weak points : first of all , the early acoustical precursors , as is known , are very small , being embodied in the acoustical noise , because of which they can be hardly measured with a good accuracy .",
    "second , it looks difficult or even impossible to extract information on log - periodic corrections from the early acoustic signals . another phenomenological expression for",
    "the energy release in the noncritical region has been suggested by sornette and andersen [ 10 ] whose arguments were based on the existence of a scaling of the macroscopic elastic modulus and the elastic energy release rate in the thermal fuse model [ 6 ] .",
    "the following phenomenological form has been proposed [ 5 ] @xmath36 which is a pure power law , like eq .",
    "( 1 ) , in the critical region close to rupture and exponentially relaxes in the noncritical region far from rupture , where only a few damages occur .",
    "however , the suggested form ( 7 ) possesses an unphysical behaviour , being negative in a wide range of its variable . at the same time , our self - similar formula ( 5 ) yields the energy release ( 6 ) that is always positive . in fig . 1",
    ", we compare the behaviour of @xmath2 , in the dimensionless form , for both eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , with the parameters chosen so that to have similar variations when approaching the critical point . in this figure",
    ", one can clearly see that eq .",
    "( 7 ) possesses unphysical negative values for the major part of the interval [ 0,1 ] , while eq .",
    "( 6 ) is everywhere positive .",
    "in order to fit our self - similar formula to experimental results of acoustic emission measurements , we refer to the most accurate data , available nowadays , that is those of anifrani s team [ 1 ] at aerospatiale - matra inc .",
    ", which are reported by johansen and sornette [ 5 ] . in these measurements ,",
    "the acoustic emission has been recorded during the pressurisation of spherical tanks of kevlar or carbon fibres pre - impregnated in a resin matrix wrapped up around a thin metallic liner ( steel or titanium ) fabricated and instrumented by aerospatiale - matra inc .",
    "it has been found that the seven acoustic emission recordings of seven pressure tanks , which were brought to rupture , exhibit a clear acceleration in agreement with a power law divergence as expected by the critical point theory .",
    "a strong evidence of oscillatory corrections , forming the intermittent succession of bursts of acoustic emission , when approaching the rupture , has been clearly identified .    in fig .",
    "2 , we present the energy release rate , which is the derivative of our formula ( 6 ) for the cumulative energy release",
    ". the result is obained by fitting to the experimental curve reported at the right bottom in figure 1 of the paper by johansen and sornette ( 2000 ) .",
    "these experimental data explicitly show an oscillatory behaviour of the energy release rate before the rupture .",
    "the best fit for the five parameters @xmath10 , @xmath17 , @xmath19 , @xmath27 , and @xmath11 have been obtained for 0.7 , 1.9 , -0.045 , 7.5 and 15 , respectively , under the given pressure of rupture at 673 bars .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 satisfies eq .",
    "the upper pressure @xmath37 bars , measured before the rupture , corresponds to the value @xmath38 , which is sufficiently small , in agreement with condition ( 4 ) .",
    "the parameters can change for different materials as well as for different experimental setups . however",
    ", the three key physical parameters : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath27 should be universal , not essentially depending on the details of the external stress in the critical region . to prove this assumption , it is necessary to accomplish a set of experiments for appropriate materials . selecting particular materials , we should keep in mind that : ( i ) the width of the critical region is linearly proportional to the strength of disorder , ( ii ) long - range elastic interactions are responsible for log - periodic corrections , ( iii ) the more brittle is the fracturing process , the stronger are the elastic interactions and stronger the energy release fluctuates , ( iv ) the fluctuations in the energy release are also stronger when a high value of a material characteristic is alternated with a low value of that characteristic .",
    "thus , elastic - porous materials are expected to be the best choice .",
