    "inflation is a candidate to solve several problems in the standard big bang model , such as the horizon problem , flatness problem , large structure of the universe , etc . and it is getting closer to be verified based on the recent planck and bicep2 observations  @xcite . both experimental results support the single field inflation with scalar spectral index @xmath4 around @xmath5 .",
    "however , the planck results provide an upper bound on the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath6 at @xmath7 c.l .  @xcite . the simple chaotic inflation model with quadratic potential @xmath8 , whose @xmath4 is out of this range , is disfavored .",
    "in contrast , the starobinsky model fits with the planck data very well  @xcite .",
    "consequently , it was important to realize the starobinsky model from fundamental theories , such as the supergravity ( sugra ) theory and string theory before the bicep2 results .",
    "the no - scale sugra  @xcite , which can be realized naturally in various string compactifications  @xcite , solves the cosmological constant problem elegantly .",
    "the starobinsky model was realized in @xmath9 no - scale sugra with wess - zumino superpotential  @xcite . following this development ,",
    "the sugra extensions of the starobinsky model have been revived  @xcite ( for more details and references , see @xcite . ) . besides",
    ", the starobinsky - like inflation can be fulfilled in string theory as well  @xcite .",
    "very recently , the bicep2 collaboration announced the range of tensor - to - scalar ratio based on the observations of cmb b - mode polarization , @xmath10 or @xmath11 by substracting the dust contributions .",
    "such large @xmath12 significantly changes the directions of the inflation model building .",
    "the starobinsky model is now disfavored by the bicep2 results .",
    "moreover , many inflation models from string theory predict small @xmath12 far below @xmath13 and thus contradict with the bicep2 results  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , chaotic inflation is indeed favoured after the bicep2 results , and since has been studied extensively  @xcite .",
    "the no - scale sugra is equipped with a curved khler manifold  @xcite , which leads to non - canonical kinetic terms for the fields along non - flat directions ( without shift symmetry ) .",
    "normally , the fields with such kind of kinetic terms move too fast toward the minimum , and then no inflation can be triggered . alternatively , through parameter tuning it is possible to get a flat direction for inflation with very small @xmath12 , such as the no - scale starobinsky model  @xcite . in short",
    ", these potentials are either too steep or too flat to generate chaotic inflation .    for chaotic inflation ,",
    "the inflaton is preferred to be the scalar with a flat direction on the khler manifold , while all the other fields along the rest of the directions should be properly stabilized .",
    "the flat directions of the khler manifold are guaranteed by the shift symmetries of the khler potential .",
    "the scalar potential is also flat if the shift symmetry is not broken by the superpotential .",
    "thus , the shift symmetry was employed to construct the chaotic inflation model in no - scale sugra  @xcite ( for a related study , see  @xcite . ) .",
    "this work is based on the sugra extension of the starobinsky model , the khler potential is of no - scale @xmath9 type , and the inflaton is the imaginary part of the modulus , which preserves the exact shift symmetry . however , the real component of the modulus is not stabilized during inflation since the masses of the real component and inflaton are comparable around the same scale .",
    "the point is that the shift symmetry is broken by the superpotenital explicitly , in consequence there is no symmetry that can prevent the inflaton from obtaining heavy mass .    besides the shift symmetry",
    ", moduli stabilization is also needed for chaotic inflation .",
    "the moduli can be stabilized by the non - perturbative effects  @xcite via the kklt mechanism in an anti - de sitter ( ads ) vacuum , which is uplifted to a metastable de sitter ( ds ) vacuum by sets of anti d3-branes where supersymmetry ( susy ) is broken explicitly .",
    "burgess , kallosh , and quevedo ( bkq ) suggested that the uplifting of the ads vacua with spontaneously susy breaking can be realized by the d - term associated with an anomalous @xmath0 gauge symmetry  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the non - perturbative part of the superpotentials in both kklt and bkq are not invariant under anomalous @xmath0 .",
    "the gauge invariant moduli stabilization was proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite based on the non - perturbative effect of hidden gauge symmetry . as the d - term is positive semi - definite , it is useful to construct the minkowski or ds vacuum .",
    "the effects of the d - term on moduli stabilization and ds vacua are also studied in ref .",
    "moreover , the f - term is widely used to uplift the ads vacua . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the oraifeartaigh model with quantum corrections is introduced to the kklt scenario .",
    "the heavy fields are integrated out while a light field is fixed at very small value .",
    "its f - term contributes to the vacuum energy and uplift the ads vacua obtained from kklt .",
    "similarly , the polonyi model can uplift the ads vacua when combined with the kklt mechanism  @xcite .    the anomalous d - term with moduli - dependent fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) term plays a special role in inflation .",
    "the fi term depends on the real component of the moduli only , so stabilization through such kind of d - term only gives heavy mass to the real component while the imaginary or axion - like part remains light .",
    "this is different from the stabilization by the f - term or d - term with constant fi term , in which cases both the real and imaginary components appear in the potentials and it is difficult to separate the masses between the real and imaginary parts at different scales . instead of stabilizing the moduli directly , chaotic - like inflation",
    "can also be obtained in no - scale sugra by minimizing a term combining the moduli and matter fields  @xcite , nevertheless , the moduli are indeed not stabilized during inflation .    in this work",
    ", we will apply the shift symmetry of the moduli to obtain chaotic inflation , where the inflaton is the corresponding axion - like field .",
    "in particular , the shift symmetry is preserved by both in khler potential and superpotential .",
    "so it can be consistently gauged to form the anomalous @xmath0 as long as the gauge anomaly is cancelled .",
    "the khler potential is inspired from the type b string compactification , where two moduli @xmath1 and @xmath2 are charged under the anomalous @xmath0 gauge symmetry .",
    "one of the moduli @xmath2 is stabilized by the kklt mechanism in a gauge invariant way .",
    "the real component of @xmath1 is automatically stabilized by the d - term associated with the anomalous @xmath0 , while its imaginary component remains light and is a natural candidate for the inflaton .",
    "we choose the moduli stabilization scale at least one order of magnitude higher than the inflation scale so that the inflation and moduli stabilization can be separated into two stages .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we briefly review gauge invariant moduli stabilization based on non - perturbative effects . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the anomaly cancellation of the anomalous @xmath0 symmetry . in section 4 ,",
    "we show by combining the non - perturbative effects and the d - term , all the moduli except the axion - like imaginary component of @xmath1 are stabilized . choosing the proper parameters , we get the minkowski vacuum and a light axion - like field with quadratic potential , which generates chaotic inflation in the scale far below the moduli stabilization scale . we discuss model building and",
    "then conclude in section 5 .",
    "in the kklt proposal , the dilaton and complex - structure moduli of calabi - yau compactification are fixed by the backgound nsns and rr fluxes .",
    "thus , there is only one khler modulus , @xmath14 , which is not fixed by the fluxes . the sugra description of its low - energy effective theory is given by the khler potential @xmath15 and the superpotential @xmath16 where the constant term @xmath17 is obtained from the fluxes which are used to stabilize the dilaton and complex - structure moduli , and the non - perturbative term @xmath18 is generated by the euclidean d3-branes or alternatively by gaugino condensation within a non - abelian sector from a stack of wrapped d7-branes .",
    "the generic f - term scalar potential is given by @xmath19 in which @xmath20 is the inverse of the khler metric @xmath21 .",
    "the potential of the modulus @xmath14 admits a supersymmetric ads vacua where @xmath14 is stabilized .",
    "there are several ways to uplift the ads vacua to ds vacua . in the original kklt proposal ,",
    "the ads vacuum is uplifted by anti d3-branes , which generates a non - supersymmetric term in the scalar potential @xmath22 where @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is a constant .    instead of breaking susy explicitly ,",
    "the ads vacua can be uplifted by the d - term in the bkq proposal  @xcite . in general , the d - term for the four - dimensional @xmath25 gauged sugra with khler term @xmath26 is @xmath27 where the gauge indices are raised by the form @xmath28^{ab}$ ] with @xmath29 the gauge kinetic function .",
    "the @xmath30 components are @xmath31 or @xmath32 if @xmath33 is gauge invariant . here , the @xmath34 are the components of the killing vector @xmath35 ,    in the bkq proposal , the killing vector has components @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "so the d - term is @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 are the matter fields which transform linearly under the anomalous @xmath0 with charges @xmath41 , and the modulus @xmath14 shifts under the anomalous @xmath0 and then is related to a field dependent fi term . that the d - term should be non - vanishing ( non - cancellability ) is a critical assumption to uplift the ads vacua . it was argued that the matter fields @xmath40 can obtain vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath42 , so the d - term is similar to the effect of the anti d3-branes .",
    "the uplift of ads vacua can also be done by f - term ( for example , see  @xcite . ) .    as noticed in the bkq proposal and ref .",
    "@xcite , it is not consistent to directly add the d - term in kklt mechanism .",
    "the modulus @xmath14 shifts under anomalous @xmath0 : @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the killing vector generating @xmath0 transformation of modulus @xmath14 . the non - perturbative term in the superpotential @xmath45 is not gauge invariant : @xmath46 .",
    "so a field dependent coefficient in the non - perturbative term is required to cancel the factor @xmath47 if the shift symmetry can be gauged consistently .",
    "a gauge invariant non - perturbative superpotential was constructed in refs .",
    "the @xmath18 in kklt is replaced by @xmath48 , in which @xmath49 is product of matter fields @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath49 transformation under @xmath0 cancels the phase factor @xmath47 so that the new @xmath45 is indeed invariant under @xmath0 .",
    "such kind of superpotential , which originated from gaugino condensation , has been studied in refs .",
    "specifically , the model employs @xmath50 fundamental quark pairs , @xmath51 under gauge group @xmath3 , and the @xmath0 charges of the quark pairs are @xmath52 .",
    "the quarks condense and form the composite meson fields @xmath53 , in which @xmath54 for @xmath55 .",
    "consequently , the effective superpotential after the condensation is @xmath56 in which the @xmath57 and its value is determined by the quantum anomaly cancellation conditions for @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which will be discussed later . obviously , the above superpotential is gauge invariant .",
    "opposite signs are assigned for @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the @xmath0 d - term is @xmath62 this d - term is non - vanishing for @xmath63 and its minimum is located at @xmath64 .",
    "the non - cancellability assumption , which is crucial for the bkq proposal , now is realized in the condensation mechanism . however , the non - cancellability directly results from the fact that @xmath65 , by introducing more fields charged under @xmath0 , this non - cancellability disappears .",
    "the modulus @xmath14 and the composite field @xmath66 can be stabilized by minimizing @xmath67 or the combination @xmath68 .",
    "based on purely @xmath67 , the vacua are of ads as usual , uplifting from the d - term results in the ds vacua .",
    "anomalous @xmath0 symmetry is obtained in the heterotic string by gauging the shift symmetry of the axion - dilaton multiplet @xmath69  @xcite .",
    "the gauge kinetic term is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the field strength of the @xmath0 vector superfield , and the gauge kinetic function is taken as @xmath72 .",
    "the gauge kinetic term contains two parts @xmath73 and @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the second term has a non - trivial transformation of @xmath69 and plays a crucial role in gauge anomaly cancellation through the green - schwarz mechanism in four - dimensional spacetime @xcite .",
    "the quantum anomaly of @xmath0 is cancelled by the term introduced from the transformation @xmath75 . however , for the heterotic string case , the anomalous @xmath0 is very constrained . as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , only the superfield @xmath69 can be transformed non - trivially under anomalous @xmath0 , otherwise there will be unwanted mass terms and tadpoles at tree level .",
    "the fi terms introduced by @xmath69 appear in heterotic string at higher loop levels , so they are expected to be much smaller than the tree - level potential . in consequence , they are not useful if a large d - term is needed .    in type b string compactification , generally there are several moduli , @xmath76 , from the calabi - yau space .",
    "the moduli - dependent part of the gauge kinetic function is @xmath77 , where @xmath78 are positive constants .",
    "anomaly cancellation is determined by the component @xmath79 . given the moduli @xmath76 transform as @xmath80 under @xmath81 , the anomaly cancellation requires @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the coefficient of the gauge anomaly from the fermionic contributions @xmath84 .",
    "specifically , for the @xmath59 gauge anomaly , the above anomaly cancellation turns into @xmath85 in which @xmath86 are the charges of quarks , and a factor @xmath87 is attributed to the over - counting of the anomaly diagrams .",
    "from the above discussions , the anomalous @xmath0 in type b string theory instead of heterotic string theory is preferred . in particular , in the type a intersecting d6-brane model building or its t - dual type b d3-d7 brane model building , we will not only have up to four anomalous @xmath88 gauge symmetries , but also have the hidden sector with additional gauge groups and exotic particles  @xcite .",
    "inspired by these string constructions , we consider the following khler potential @xmath89 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 transform non - trivially , @xmath90 under the anomalous @xmath0 , the @xmath50 quark pairs @xmath91 form fundamental representation of @xmath92 gauge symmetry with @xmath0 charges @xmath93 . as proposed before , the quarks @xmath40 condense and form composite meson fields @xmath94 .",

    "<S> the simple chaotic inflation is highly consistent with the bicep2 experiment , and no - scale supergravity can be realized naturally in various string compactifications . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we construct a chaotic inflation model in no - scale supergravity inspired from type b string compactification with an anomalous @xmath0 gauged symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce two moduli @xmath1 and @xmath2 which transform non - trivially under @xmath0 , and some pairs of fundamental quarks charged under the @xmath3 gauge group . the non - trivial transformations of moduli under @xmath0 lead to a moduli - dependent fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) term . </S>",
    "<S> the modulus @xmath2 and the real component of @xmath1 are stabilized by the non - perturbative effect from quark condensation and the @xmath0 d - term . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the stabilization from the anomalous @xmath0 d - term with moduli - dependent fi term is crucial for inflation since it gives heavy mass to the real component of the modulus @xmath1 while keeping its axionic part light . choosing the proper parameters , we obtain a global minkowski vacuum where the imaginary part of @xmath1 has a quadratic potential for chaotic inflation . </S>"
