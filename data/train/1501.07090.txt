    "the fact , that such poles of the pad approximants form a pair with the zeros that are near them and in this pair they are asymptotically close to each other and when taking the limit are canceled out , has led some authors to believe that their appearance is random and is not connected with the nature of the original function @xmath145 .",
    "such an approach to this property reflected on the respective terminology : such zeros and poles of the approximant began to be called `` spurious '' .",
