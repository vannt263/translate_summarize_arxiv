    "bilayer graphene  @xcite is a remarkable electronic material because it supports a variety of spectra , determined by the relative angle of the nearest neighbor bonds of the two layers  @xcite , which may be continuously tuned with interlayer bias  @xcite .",
    "the most common configuration , bernal ( `` ab '' ) stacking , can be turned into a band insulator by application of an interlayer bias , and this behavior allows the generation of domain walls with topologically non - trivial electronic properties , both in zero  @xcite and in finite  @xcite magnetic fields . at the other extreme ,",
    "aa - stacked graphene bilayers  @xcite can be created and should support interesting electronic phases  @xcite .",
    "interpolating between these two extremes is twisted bilayer graphene ( tblg ) , in which a periodic moir pattern with regions of ab and aa stacking are contained in each unit cell  @xcite . in momentum space ,",
    "an important feature of this structure is the existence of low energy saddle points , which lead to observable van hove singularities in the density of states @xcite .",
    "interactions in the setting of such an enhanced density of states could lead to unusual electronic states @xcite .",
    "although van hove singularities are present in the density of states for single layer graphene , placing the fermi level in their vicinity requires a high level of doping which has so far not been achievable . from this perspective",
    ", tblg offers an advantage because the van hove singularity is accessible at a much lower doping level .",
    "it is therefore important to understand the effects of the saddle points which underpin the van hove singularity on the electronic structure of tblg , and how they might be probed experimentally . in this paper",
    "we study this question for the non - interacting system , focusing on the effects of a magnetic field , and in particular how cyclotron resonance can uncover various properties of the spectrum and electronic wavefunctions .",
    "the low - energy dynamics of electrons in tblg is governed by dirac cones from the top and bottom layers , and a periodic vertical hopping between them  @xcite .",
    "the locations of the dirac points in momentum space are different for each of the two layers because of the twist angle . near the neutrality point ( zero energy ) , the dirac dispersions remain linear in spite of the interlayer coupling , although the fermi velocity is reduced  @xcite . away from this energy , near the value at which there are states at the same energy and momentum from both layers in the absence of interlayer coupling , tunneling has strong effects : the bands split into an upper and lower branch , the lower one containing a saddle point and the upper a quadratic minimum @xcite . in terms of the density of states , the former leads to a logarithmic divergence while the latter is revealed by a sharp jump  @xcite . in the presence of a magnetic field , below the saddle point energy",
    "one finds landau levels which are similar to those of single - layer graphene but with a two - fold degeneracy due to the layer degree of freedom  @xcite . above the saddle point , however , tunneling between the layers becomes qualitatively relevant .",
    "the energy interval between the saddle point and the quadratic minimum represents a transition region that supports interweaving electron - like and hole - like energy levels which can be understood within a semiclassical framework  @xcite .",
    "in particular , one may to an excellent approximation regard the semiclassical orbits as residing in one or the other layer for energies below the saddle point . above it , the orbits necessarily periodically tunnel between the layers  @xcite . above the energy of the quadratic minimum ,",
    "the semiclassical orbits become more complicated , and the full intricacy of bands and gaps that characterizes the `` hofstadter spectrum '' becomes apparent  @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we explore what is revealed about the crossover behavior in the vicinity of the saddle point in cyclotron resonance @xcite .",
    "a unique aspect of a bilayer system is the possibility to orient the electric field polarization of the incoming radiation perpendicular to the layers",
    ". such radiation can not be absorbed in single layer systems , but in bilayers it can be , provided the wavefunctions of the initial and/or final states involve both layers .",
    "thus a comparison of absorption spectra for parallel ( i.e. , in - plane ) and perpendicular orientations can help distinguish regions of the spectrum supporting different types of wavefunctions .",
    "our analysis employs a continuum model of tblg @xcite , which is used to describe a circular system of finite size . within this model , with an appropriate gauge choice the model hamiltonian possesses three - fold rotational symmetry , allowing the eigenstates to be classified into three sectors .",
    "interestingly , incoming radiation polarized perpendicular to the layers induces only intra - sector excitations , while parallel polarization induces only inter - sector excitations .",
    "overall , our calculations demonstrate that the absorption spectrum for tblg is very different than that of two decoupled layers .",
    "in particular there is very strong absorption for transitions involving states below the negative energy and/or above the positive energy quadratic band , such that the overall absorption is greatly enhanced over that of two single layers , as we show in more detail below .",
    "as might be expected , density of states calculations show that states primarily localized in a single layer can be distinguished from ones distributed between two layers by their behavior with interlayer bias : the energies of the former are sensitive to bias while the latter are not @xcite .",
    "moreover , we find that landau levels become highly broadened as they pass through the saddle point energy with increasing magnetic field . in cyclotron resonance , we find that peaks associated with intralayer initial and final states are insensitive to interlayer bias , while transitions involving interlayer states shift noticeably with bias .",
    "the energy scale for which states above the quadratic band edge become involved and absorption starts to increase markedly is also sensitive to this bias .",
    "finally , we show that the large broadening of a landau level when it is in the vicinity of the saddle point greatly enhances intra - landau level absorption . in principle",
    "this effect could be used to locate the energy of the saddle point in the zero field spectrum .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the model hamiltonian used in our analysis , and how the three - fold symmetry is exploited in the calculation .",
    "section iii is devoted to density of states calculations , which are compared and contrasted with the expected results for single layers .",
    "section iv contains results of calculated cyclotron resonance spectra in various circumstances .",

    "twisted bilayer graphene with an interlayer bias @xmath0 can be modeled by a continuum hamiltonian of the form @xcite    h= (    cccc h_d & v + v^ & h_d    ) + (    cccc _ 2 & 0 + 0 & -_2    ) , [ basicmodel ] where @xmath1 is the single - layer graphene dirac hamiltonian . in this expression @xmath2 and @xmath3",

    "the eigenstates of @xmath16 are    _ n , m,= (    c|n , m +     ) , with the basis ket states given by     angular momentum , respectively @xcite , and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) the raising operator for the landau level index ( angular momentum ) . the angular momentum of these states is captured by the relation @xmath20 , with @xmath21 .",
    "the hilbert space for this problem is defined by integers @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in practice ,",
    "we introduce numerical cutoffs for the upper values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which are large enough that the results presented below are insensitive to their precise values .",
    "note that in introducing these cutoffs , we are effectively considering a finite size system @xcite , but the portions of the resulting spectra that we analyze involve wavefunctions well - away from the edge .    for the single layer dirac system",

    "the full @xmath29 symmetry of such rotations is broken down to a @xmath30 rotational symmetry by the interlayer coupling @xmath31 .",
    "this can be seen by first noting that @xmath32 .",
    "for the three wavevectors @xmath33 , the rotation operator @xmath34 acts cyclically , rotating @xmath35 into @xmath36 . from this",
    ", one may show that the vertical hopping matrices follow an analogous cyclic relation , @xmath37 .",
    "consequently , the interlayer hopping matrix under a three - fold rotation transforms as @xmath38 .",
    "we may absorb the additional factor @xmath14 by defining the full rotational operator    g=|u(),[g_sym ] where the pauli matrix @xmath39 acts on the layer index and the complex number @xmath40 .",

    "the arrows indicate positions of landau levels in the absence of interlayer tunneling , and for the lowest few landau indices @xmath24 we can see that even with interlayer tunneling , density of states peaks can be assigned a definite landau level index , although they are broadened relative to the case with no interlayer tunneling .",

    "there are two new orbits as illustrated in ( c ) , and the closed orbit illustrated represents a branch of allowed states when the energy exceeds @xmath84 .",
    "the reconnected orbits now oscillate between layers , and the corresponding states are manifestly delocalized between them.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    this mixed behavior may be understood in terms of the semiclassical description of wavefunctions in a magnetic field , which are built up from semiclassical orbits in the brillouin zone , leading to some some wavefunctions being more strongly coupled across the layers than others .",

    "[ z150](a ) and ( b ) show the results for the out - of - plane configuration with and without interlayer bias .",
    "in contrast with the in - plane configuration , it can be seen that the transition associated with single - layer behavior is completely absent , so that features relatively independent of interlayer bias @xmath0 are not present .",
    "the threshold frequency beyond which absorption increases markedly is sensitive to the interlayer bias , just as in the in - plane polarization case .",
    "we may also use this configuration to explore the saddle point in the band structure . as mentioned above",
    ", the power absorption will vanish in the limit that the interlayer coupling @xmath112 , so that absorption in this configuration is sensitive to whether the states are delocalized across the layers .",
    "one way in which this is manifested is the broadening of landau levels as they cross the saddle point with increasing field .",
    "this admits the possibility of intra - landau level absorption . such absorption is highly suppressed in single layers because it can only occur when there is some perturbation that can relax the selection rule . in this case",

    "[ evolvell ] shows two density of states plots in which the @xmath80 landau levels are pushed toward higher energy , broadening and and deforming the peak in the process .",
    "this broadening creates the possibility of electromagnetic absorption at very low - frequencies due to the intra - landau level transitions .",
    "shown in the insets are the absorption spectra , which now contain a low - energy peak . comparing the two peaks for the landau level just below and just above the saddle point , one can see a dramatic increase in both the maximum peak height and its oscillator strength as the landau level center passes from just below to just above the saddle point energy .",
    "[ power_sp ] shows results for the oscillator strength ( obtained by numerically integrating the area under the peaks such as shown in the insets of fig .",

    "we have studied the density of states and cyclotron resonance for landau levels of tblg within a continuum model .",
    "the model supports a three - fold symmetry which allows the states to be separated into three sectors , allowing some simplification of the numerical calculations .",
    "we find that the spectrum in a magnetic field evolves from discrete levels closely akin to single layer landau levels into increasingly overlapping bands with increasing energy .",
    "below the saddle point , the  band width \" is very small and the magnetic states are mainly layer - polarized . above the saddle point , the magnetic states becomes strongly layer - delocalized and the bands are significantly broader .",
    "this behavior follows from semiclassical descriptions of the wavefunctions , in which orbits in different layers begin to cross one another above the saddle point energy .    in order to explore the impact of interlayer coupling and related saddle points in the tblg band structure , we propose two configurations for measuring electromagnetic absorption ( cyclotron resonance ) in this system . in one configuration the external electric field is polarized along the in - plane direction , and we find that as long as the magnetic field is not too strong , states below the saddle point are effectively layer - polarized and give rise to the same response as a single - layer system . on the other hand , the responses at higher frequencies involve layer - delocalized states . in the other configuration , where the electric field is polarized perpendicular to the system , layer delocalized states must be involved in the transitions .",
    "the different kinds of states may be distinguished by whether they can contribute to both types of absorptions , and by their sensitivity to interlayer bias .",
    "we also found that the landau level bands broaden significantly above the saddle point , so that power absorption becomes possible at very low frequency which is completely absent in the single layer case . in the perpendicular polarization configuration ,",
    "we find the absorption increases significantly when the landau band is elevated above the saddle point . in principle , this allows one to locate the saddle point energy from the absorption spectra of tblg .",
