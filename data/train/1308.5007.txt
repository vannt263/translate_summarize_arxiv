    "the observational data from anisotropic measures of the cosmic microwave background @xcite and observations of type ia supernova @xcite , among other , shows that the universe has entered a phase of late accelerated expansion .",
    "the most accepted interpretation in the context of einstein s general relativity is that this phase is driven by a kind of unknown component called dark energy @xcite , which constitutes around @xmath0 of the total energy density in the universe today .",
    "this component is usually described by a fluid with a negative pressure and various theoretical models have been proposed , among others , scalar field models called quintessence @xcite , tachyon fields @xcite , quintom ( schemes that cross the constant barrier of the cosmological constant @xmath1=-1 ) @xcite , phantom fields ( schemes that leads to future singularities in the evolution ) @xcite and holographic dark energy @xcite , which is based on the application of the holographic principle to cosmology . according to @xcite",
    "the energy contained in a region of size @xmath2 must not exceed the mass of a black hole of the same size , which means , in terms of energy density , @xmath3 .",
    "if in a cosmological context we saturate this inequality by doing @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the hubble parameter , as @xmath6 , we obtain a model of holographic nature for the dark energy density .",
    "based on this idea , m. li @xcite proposed the model @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the dark energy density and @xmath9 is a positive constant that fulfills @xmath10 @xcite . in @xcite",
    "there is an expression for the pressure as a function of @xmath11 and there is a generalization of holographic dark energy as a function of the particle horizon and the future horizon , i.e. @xmath12 .",
    "later on the model @xmath13 was proposed , where @xmath14 is the ricci scalar @xcite . in the reference @xcite , inspired by the curvature scalar and for the spatially flat section ,",
    "the model called ricci - like was then proposed , with @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are constant .",
    "moreover , this holographic ricci - like dark energy density is also proposed in @xcite as an expansion on powers of its arguments corresponding to a cut - off given by a general function that depends on the hubble parameters and its first derivative . + in the context of non - interacting cosmic fluids , where dark matter and energy are conserved independently , both constants are positive and less than one according to the supernovae comparison performed by @xcite .",
    "interacting models based on this generalization have been studied by @xcite for the modified holographic ricci dark energy ( mhrde ) , although this work was focused on providing an interaction function rather than obtaining it .",
    "the present work was developed in the framework of a flat friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmology with two interacting fluids , with one of these being a dark energy component ( ricci - like ) and the other component , a pressureless dark matter component .",
    "the interaction form will not be given a priori as an ansatz , but rather as a function to be determined .",
    "the possibility that this function crosses the non - interacting line makes studying the interacting model interesting , given that the phenomenological standard choices do not permit a transition .",
    "the sign of the phenomenological interacting term , @xmath18 , determines the direction of the energy flux .",
    "if @xmath18 is positive , there is a decay of dark energy into dark matter and if @xmath18 is negative , there is transference of dark matter into dark energy .",
    "observational evidence has been found of the interaction between dark energy and dark matter from the abell cluster a586 @xcite .",
    "observations by @xcite indicate the possibility of the decay of dark matter into dark energy and more recently @xcite analyze linear cosmological interaction with planck data and conclude that the interaction is compatible with the latest and more precise observations .",
    "it is noteworthy to mention that they obtain slightly negative interaction in some cases . in @xcite",
    "the authors contrast dark sector interactions with three different observables show a relation between the sign and amplitude of the interaction with the amplitude of the ksz effect .",
    "they also mention that future experiments might provide the first detection of interaction in the dark sector .",
    "+ we will discuss the characteristic of such interaction ( described through a function @xmath18 ) , focusing on the changes it undergoes in the presence of the term @xmath19 .",
    "we will study the interaction between dark energy and dark matter in the context of holographic ricci - like dark energy .",
    "different ansatzes for the variable state parameters will be implemented to close the system , such that it can be integrated analytically .",
    "this allows the energy densities to be obtained , and the resulting ranges where the weak energy condition ( positive energy densities ) is respected .",
    "+ finally , we will adjust the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 with type ia supernova data and thus describe the function @xmath18 .",
    "such function is a result of the holography and its sign during the evolution of the system is related to the parameters value , not a prior .",
    "we will also discuss different models of late evolution that result from our approach .",
    "+ this article is organized as follows , section @xmath20 describes the scheme of interacting fluids with holographic ricci - like dark energy and section @xmath21 develops some models in detail using observational constraints with type ia supernovae .",
    "finally , section @xmath22 is devoted to the discussion and final remarks .",
    "we begin our analysis considering an interacting flat model with @xmath23 , the dark energy component and the pressure @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the pressureless dark matter component .",
    "the field equations , considering @xmath26=@xmath27=@xmath28 , are @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the hubble parameter and @xmath31 is the scale factor . assuming that in our model , dark energy exchanges energy with dark matter through a phenomenological coupling function @xmath18 , the conservation equation for each fluid are given as @xmath32 there have been several models considered in the literature for @xmath18 as a function of the energy densities and the hubble parameter @xcite , usually considering a specific form that allows the equations ( [ de ] ) and ( [ dm ] ) to be integrated analytically @xcite .",
    "in the present study , we do not use a specific model for this coupling term , but rather obtain it after implementing , in the field equations , different ansatzes , either for the eos parameter or the cosmic coincidence parameter @xmath33 . from ( [ de ] ) and ( [ dm ] ) the total energy density equation",
    "is conserved @xmath34    for the dark energy density we consider the ricci - like model given by @xmath35 where @xmath16 y @xmath17 are both positive constants that will be fit using observational data .",
    "this ansatz has an implicit equivalence with others models for the dark energy pressure described in @xcite , which can be clearly seen obtaining @xmath36 from ( [ hl ] ) and replacing it in ( [ yy ] ) for a dust dark matter configuration , as @xmath37 which is equivalent to the initial pressure described in the increased matter model for @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "this can also be seen as a quadratic equation of state @xmath40 resolving ( [ pde ] ) to be zero .",
    "all of these pressures emerge as a particular case of a generalized fluid that uses a function @xmath41 for the hubble parameter in order to study the pressure as a function of @xmath42 , which is equivalent to consider the ricci - like dark energy model .",
    "+ the expression ( [ pde ] ) is not politropic but resembles inhomogeneous fluid cosmology , where the pressure has dependence not only in the dark energy density but also on the hubble parameter . in @xcite",
    "the authors review this model considering an expression for the dark energy pressure as a function of @xmath43 which for our case can be seen rewritting the pressure in eq ( [ pde ] ) .",

    "+ by taking the time derivative of ( [ 00 ] ) with respect to time , we obtain @xmath46 and using ( [ 00 ] ) , ( [ hl ] ) and ( [ dv00 ] ) in ( [ de+dm ] ) , a differential equation is obtained for the hubble parameter in terms of the parameter @xmath1 , @xmath47 an equation that can not be integrated , unless we have information about the dark energy variable parameter @xmath1 . in this case , the holographic ricci - like dark energy can be written in the form @xmath48 the weak energy condition ( wec ) leads to @xmath49 , imposing constraints on the model parameters due to this inequality .",
    "+ let us note that the cosmological constant scenario is included as a particular case , given that for @xmath50 , one can solve ( [ 1hpt ] ) and obtain @xmath51 where @xmath52 arctanh @xmath53 , is an integration constant .",
    "+ considering the limit at late times when @xmath54 tends to infinity , from ( [ hl ] ) we obtain @xmath55 and the dark energy parameter @xmath56 .",
    "the associated interaction for this particular case at late times , from the equation ( [ de ] ) , is @xmath57 and @xmath58 , a positive constant . for the case",
    "@xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 at late times , thus emulating the @xmath63cdm scenario for the late universe .",
    "this particular case that includes @xmath63cdm does not solve the cosmic coincidence problem , we will focus on more general scenarios .",
    "+ considering the result in ( [ r2 ] ) , the cosmic coincidence parameter @xmath64 , can be written as a function of the constants of the model and of the parameter @xmath1 as @xmath65 this result allows to establish that giving an ansatz in the parameter @xmath1 or in @xmath64 has an equivalence in our formulation .",
    "this is similar to the result found by the authors in @xcite for non - interacting ricci holography , @xcite for a given interaction in ricci - like holography and for interacting mhrde @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that this equivalence is a consequence of the holographic nature of the dark energy .",
    "the importance of studying variable eos is relevant in ( [ r ] ) , since the case for a constant @xmath1 would result in a constant @xmath64 for all time .",
    "the equivalence between @xmath64 and @xmath66 allows simplification of the equation ( [ 1hpt ] ) as @xmath67 therefore , it is equivalent to consider an ansatz for @xmath64 , such that ( [ hh ] ) can be integrated .",
    "+ by considering the definition of the deceleration parameter @xmath68 and the equation ( [ hh ] ) , we obtain @xmath69 whereas if we have an ansatz for the coincidence parameter @xmath70 , the deceleration parameter @xmath71 can be obtained , and thus we can study whether the model is accelerated at late times .",
    "it is noteworthy to mention that given that for constant @xmath66 , we have constant @xmath64 , in this case the desceleration parameter would also be constant , thus not evolving from an non - acclerated universe to a accelerated one .",

    "the interaction was positive without giving a function a priori , meaning the constraint @xmath78 was obtained through the study of the critical points of the system and wec . under these conditions",
    "it was obtained that the state parameter is phantom like ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "these results differ from our case because the parameter @xmath66 is not bound to cross the phantom barrier and the sign of @xmath18 remains undetermined so far .",
    "+ in the present paper , the result obtained in ( [ r ] ) indicates that the evolution of @xmath64 is determined by the evolution of the ansatz in @xmath1 , a relation obtained due to the holographic context in ( [ hl ] ) .",
    "this means that it is equivalent to study the expression for interaction described by ( [ qr ] ) in order to study the interaction as a function of the state parameter @xmath1 , given as @xmath80 in the expressions ( [ qr ] ) and ( [ qw ] ) , it can be observed that the sign of the interaction can change according to the choice of ansatz ( @xmath1 o @xmath64 ) and the sign of its respective derivatives .",

    "there are two sign changes , @xmath188 , one in the past , for @xmath158 ( from @xmath183 to @xmath78 ) and the other is in the future , for @xmath159 ( from @xmath78 to @xmath183 ) , as shown in the fig .",
    "the interaction decreases until the validity range of the models ends at @xmath189 . + for case @xmath105 , the best fit is for the parameters @xmath190 with @xmath185 .",
    "using the ansatz for @xmath64 allows a model free of singularities with a reasonable value of @xmath167 for cosmic coincidence . for the interaction @xmath18 ,",
    "there is a change of sign in the past , for @xmath175 , from @xmath183 to @xmath78 , as can be appreciated in fig .",
    "6 . in the future the interaction @xmath18 decreases asymptotically to zero and from early times until today behaves similarly to the graphic of the interaction presented by @xcite .",
    "+ in the cases that present singularity , the moment at which occurs @xmath191 is not included within the range of validity of the model , it occurs in the future ( @xmath192 ) and the interaction evolves in such a way that the transference is from dark matter into dark energy for @xmath193 .",
    "+ regarding the cases studied , imposing conditions on the parameters in the search for minimums modifies the result and the behavior of the model .",
    "this is interpreted as reducing the parameter space into one that has physical validity , then the minimum presented is within such a region .",
    "values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 are of the same order of magnitude as the fit obtained for the ricci holography case @xcite .",
    "the parameters associated with the equation of state of the dark energy , @xmath127 , @xmath126 and @xmath163 are compatible with the current view of the universe .",
    "the sign of the function @xmath18 in the three cases presented changes at some point in its evolution , it is noteworthy to mention that this is not a given characteristic ( as previously mentioned in section ( [ dos ] ) ) , but rather a direct consequence of the holographic context given by a ricci - like dark energy model .",
