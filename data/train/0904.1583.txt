    "modern cosmological observations surely confirm that the expansion of the universe is accelerated .",
    "such phenomenon can be described using the models based on the einstein equations with @xmath5-term @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in this case several unsolved problems exist , e.g. , the fine tuning and cosmic coincidence ones which are caused by the constant energy density corresponding to this fundamental quantity @xcite .",
    "alternatively one can assume the existence of new mysterious essence  dark energy .",
    "this repulsive component is regarded frequently as a scalar field , the lagrangian of which can have either canonical kinetic term ( classical field ) @xcite or non - canonical one ( e.g. , tachyon @xcite , k - essence @xcite ) .",
    "it is often convenient to calculate the characteristics of the large - scale structure and cmb anisotropy in the phenomenological fluid framework , in which the dark energy model is defined by its density , equation of state ( eos ) parameter and effective sound speed .",
    "the dynamical dark energy has been widely studied using both scalar field and fluid approaches on the background level as well as at the linear and non - linear @xcite stages of perturbations growth for either minimal or non - minimal @xcite coupling to other components . moreover ,",
    "the models unifying both dark matter and dark energy have been proposed @xcite . for quintessential dark energy the eos parameter @xmath0",
    "is assumed to be larger than @xmath6 , the models with @xmath7 are called phantom ones @xcite .",
    "the phantom divide crossing is not allowed for single fields with the simplest lagrangians , therefore in such case the specific single - field models as well as multi - field ones should be discussed ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to perform the comparative analysis of 4 possible scalar field models of dark energy .",
    "this allows us to find the most sensitive to dark energy type features and thus to propose the simple tests for identification of the source accelerating the expansion of the universe .",
    "as the theoretically motivated scalar field potentials @xcite frequently lead to the cosmological consequences contradicting the observations , we perform the reverse ingeneering , i.e. , construct the potentials leading to the given dark energy properties ( energy density , eos parameter ) .",
    "we study the scalar fields with 2 shapes of lagrangian : classical ( klein - gordon ) and tachyonic ( dirac - born - infeld ) ones . for our research",
    "we have chosen the dark energy eos parameter to be either constant or evolving in such way that the dark energy adiabatic sound speed @xmath1 equals 0 .",
    "the reason for such choice is that in both cases the analytic solutions of the background field equations exist .",
    "the latter parametrization is especially interesting since for homogeneous fields it produces naturally the behavior mimicing the dust matter at early time and cosmological constant at very late epoch , so it can be regarded as possible candidate for so - called unified dark matter .",
    "all fields were studied assuming the same set of the best fitting cosmological parameters obtained by wmap and other projects .",
    "since the background dynamics in models with both lagrangians is the same , the main attention should be paid to the linear stage of evolution of perturbations . on this level",
    "the degeneracy due to the lagrangian type also exists , however the wide class of models becomes principally distinguishable . in this work",
    "we study the model of the universe filled only with nonrelativistic matter and minimally coupled scalar field acting as dark energy .",
    "we focus on the influence of perturbed dark energy on matter perturbations and emphasize the effect of the inclusion of dust matter on evolution of dark energy inhomogeneities .",
    "the latter effect is commonly ignored due to the undetectability of dark energy perturbations . nevertheless it should be also investigated as it might be important for better understanding of the gravitational interaction of both dark components and thus for discovering of the nature of dark energy .",
    "we discuss also the gravitational instability in the single - component models with @xmath3 in context of the unified dark matter .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ bckgr ]",
    "we discuss briefly the background dynamics of our models . in section [ evolsec ] the evolution equations for the gauge - invariant perturbation variables",
    "are written and adiabatic initial conditions are set . in section [ disc ]",
    "we discuss the numerical solutions of the perturbations equations for the single fields with @xmath3 , 2-component model of the universe and build the transfer functions for both components .",
    "we propose also the characteristics which can be used for determination of the dark energy type .",
    "the conclusions can be found in section [ concl ] . in appendix",
    "we present the evolution equations for the field variables .",
    "we consider the homogeneous and isotropic flat universe with metric of 4-space @xmath8 where the factor @xmath9 is the scale factor , normalized to 1 at the current epoch @xmath10 , @xmath11 is conformal time ( @xmath12 ) . here and below we put @xmath13 , so the time variable @xmath14 has the dimension of a length .",
    "the latin indices @xmath15 run from 0 to 3 and the greek ones over the spatial part of the metric : @xmath16=1 , 2 , 3 .    if the universe is filled with non - relativistic matter ( cold dark matter and baryons ) and minimally coupled dark energy , the dynamics of its expansion is completely described by the einstein equations @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the ricci tensor and @xmath19 , @xmath20  energy - momentum tensors of matter @xmath21 and dark energy @xmath22 .",
    "if these components interact only gravitationally then each of them satisfy the differential energy - momentum conservation law separately : @xmath23 ( here and below `` ; '' denotes the covariant derivative with respect to the coordinate with given index in the space with metric @xmath24 ) . for the perfect fluid with density @xmath25 and pressure @xmath26 , related by the equation of state @xmath27 , it gives @xmath28 ( here and below a dot denotes the derivative with respect to the conformal time : `` @xmath29''@xmath30 ) .",
    "the matter is considered to be non - relativistic , so @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( here and below `` 0 '' denotes the current values ) .",
    "we assume the dark energy to be a scalar field with either klein - gordon ( classical ) lagrangian @xmath33 or dirac - born - infeld ( tachyonic ) one @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the field potentials defining the model , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are kinetic terms .",
    "we postulate also that the background scalar fields are homogeneous ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) , so their energy density and pressure depend only on time : @xmath41 the evolution equations for field variables @xmath42 and @xmath43 are presented in appendix [ ap ] .",
    "we specify the model of each field using 2 parameters : the eos parameter @xmath44 and the so - called adiabatic speed of sound @xmath45 does nt play a role of the true sound speed of dark energy , it is rather a useful function , the form of which is similar to that of the adiabatic sound speed for barotropic eos . ] , which satisfy the relation : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the hubble parameter ( expansion rate ) for any moment of conformal time @xmath11 .",

    "in this paper we study the classical and tachyonic scalar fields with potentials constructed for @xmath2 and @xmath3 using the same set of the best fitting cosmological parameters from @xcite ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) . for all models there",
    "are 2 independent solutions for the field : the growing one ( sign + ) and the decaying one ( sign - ) .",
    "therefore 2 symmetrical with respect to either @xmath67 or @xmath68 potentials exist in each case @xcite .",
    "however , the physical consequences of both these solutions are the same , so from now we restrict ourselves only to the growing one .",
    "the analysis of dynamics of the universe expansion for fields with @xmath2 and @xmath3 was presented in @xcite . it does nt depend on the scalar field lagrangian and does nt allow us to distinguish surely such models of scalar fields .",
    "so in order to propose the test for choice of the dark energy type which would be more adequate to observations we should study at least the linear stage of the evolution of scalar perturbations .",
    "for derivation of the evolution equations for scalar linear perturbations it is convenient to use the conformal - newtonian gauge with space - time metric @xcite @xmath69,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are gauge - invariant metric perturbations called bardeen s potentials @xcite , which in the case of zero proper anisotropy of medium ( as for the dust matter and scalar fields ) have equal absolute values and opposite signs : @xmath72 @xcite . in the linear perturbation theory it is convenient to perform the fourrier transform of all spatially - dependent variables ,",
    "so the equations will be written for the corresponding fourier amplitudes of the metric ( @xmath73 ) , matter density and velocity perturbations ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) as well as the scalar field perturbations ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 ) ( here @xmath80 is wave number ) .",
    "these variables are gauge - invariant @xcite . the energy density and velocity perturbations of dark energy , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , are connected with the perturbation of field variables @xmath83 , @xmath84 in the following way : @xmath85    other non - vanishing gauge - invariant perturbations of scalar field are isotropic pressure perturbation @xmath86 and intrinsic entropy @xmath87 the density perturbation of any component in the conformal - newtonian gauge @xmath88 , which is gauge - invariant variable , is related to the other gauge - invariant variables of density perturbations @xmath89 and @xmath90 as : @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath93 correspond to either @xmath94- or @xmath54-component . here",
    "@xmath90 is the density perturbation in the frame of vanishing curvature fluctuations and @xmath89 corresponds to the rest frame , i.e. , the frame in which the 4-velocity is orthogonal to constant time hypersurface .    for the scalar fields the intrinsic entropy perturbation is defined as : @xmath95 where @xmath4 is the dark energy effective ( rest frame ) sound speed : @xmath96 for lagrangians with canonical kinetic term it is always 1 , for tachyonic ones @xmath97 .    for further study it is convenient to use the evolution equations for gauge - invariant density and velocity perturbation variables",
    "the corresponding equations for perturbations of field variables can be found in appendix [ ap ] .",
    "it should be noted that the principal degeneracy due to the lagrangian shape exists also in the linear theory , i.e. , different lagrangians can lead to the same value of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "however , the analysis of this stage of evolution of perturbations is still important since it removes partially the degeneracy existing on the background level .",

    "that in principle allows us to distinguish both lagrangians , however the difference is nt large ( for @xmath0 close to @xmath6  as it has been estimated on basis of the observable data @xcite ) and suggests the similarity of solutions for both fields . in @xmath3-case @xmath103 but @xmath104 , so the behavior of perturbations in classical field and tachyon with the same cosmological parameters should be really different .",
    "therefore , in each case we have the system of 5 first - order ordinary differential equations for 5 unknown functions @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 . the following constraint equation is also satisfied : @xmath110      it is known that the observable large - scale structure has grown from the small adiabatic perturbations generated in the early universe . since the density of the @xmath2-fields is negligible at the early epoch ( @xmath55 ) and @xmath3-fields mimic dust matter , all our models are initially matter - dominated . in such case",
    "the growing mode of adiabatic perturbations corresponds to @xmath111 .",

    "it should be noted that in agreement with previous conclusions the perturbed classical field affects the matter transfer function more than tachyonic one .    in the bottom panel",
    "the scale dependence of @xmath188 is shown for the present epoch .",
    "as we can see , comparing with the dust matter transfer functions the dark energy ones are reduced by approximately 9 orders for both @xmath2-fields , 10 orders for the classical field with @xmath3 and 5 orders for @xmath3-tachyon at small scales ( @xmath118 mpc@xmath119 ) .",
    "the scale dependence of @xmath188 is monotonous for @xmath2-fields with both lagrangians and @xmath3-classical field ( the latter is smaller approximately by an order than the former ones ) . for tachyonic field the scale dependence of transfer function oscillates with decreasing amplitude .",
    "these oscillations are simply produced by different phases , which the density perturbations of different scales have at @xmath178 .",
    "it is interesting to see that their period ( especially for large @xmath80 ) is almost constant and equals approximately @xmath189 mpc@xmath119 .",
    "the evolution of the scalar linear perturbations is studied for the 2-component ( dust matter and minimally coupled dark energy ) cosmological models .",
    "the dark energy component is assumed to be either classical or tachyonic scalar field with the potentials constructed for eos parameters satisfying the condition either @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "the analysis of gravitational instability of the single field models shows that the behavior of subhorizon perturbations is oscillatory in all studied cases .",
    "thus the fields with @xmath3 , although on the background level they mimic dust matter at early epoch and the cosmological constant in far future , ca nt serve as unified dark matter because they do nt cluster on scales smaller than particle horizon .    .",
    "the computed by camb cold dark matter transfer function for fields with @xmath2 is shown for comparison.,width=188 ]    in all 2-component models the dark energy is almost smoothed out on subhorizon scales .",
    "the perturbations of fields with @xmath2 grow or decay without visible oscillations and their evolution is similar for both types of lagrangian ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath3-tachyon density perturbations remains oscillatory ( unlike that of the corresponding classical field , see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "such difference is caused by behavior of the effective sound speed of dark energy . in @xmath2-case",
    "the quantity @xmath4 is large and almost the same for both types of lagrangian at all stages of evolution of perturbations as soon as the observational data prefer the values of the eos parameter close to @xmath6 . in @xmath3-case",
    "the effective sound speed of classical field is always equal to @xmath175 , while @xmath4 of tachyon varies in time as @xmath190 , so it is relatively small before the beginning of dark energy dominated epoch .",
    "it was found that the inhomogeneities of scalar fields with larger effective sound speed are more affected by @xmath191 .",
    "this effect , though undetectable , could be interesting from the purely theoretical point of view as it might be useful for better understanding of the dark energy nature",
    ". the same applies to the dark energy transfer functions .",
    "the caused by perturbed dark energy scale dependence of the nonrelativistic matter growth and transfer functions as well as of the gravitational potential ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]-[fig6 ] ) is small and almost the same for both fields with @xmath2 . in @xmath3-case",
    "it is large and different for classical field and tachyon .",
    "such behavior is due to the effective sound speed of dark energy .",
    "the discussed scale dependence provides us with simple tests for choice of model which describes the observational data in the best way .",
    "the tests can be based on measurements of the matter density perturbations power spectrum and late isw - effect .",
    "this work was supported by the project of ministry of education and science of ukraine ( state registration number 0107u002062 ) and the research program of national academy of sciences of ukraine ( state registration number 0107u007279 ) . o.",
