    "this task becomes particularly challenging in a variety of contexts in which the interactions induce strong inter - particle correlations . for instance , this strongly - correlated behavior appears in condensed - matter models whenever the system can not be divided into weakly - interacting parts , such that the whole can not be understood as a sum of its parts and perturbative methods become futile  @xcite .",
    "this inherent complexity underlies the abundance of interesting phases of matter that emerge at different scales , but also the difficulty in understanding them from an original microscopic model ( e.g. high-@xmath3 superconductivity  @xcite ) .",
    "the same occurs at much higher temperatures and densities , where quarks and gluons interact strongly , and lead to a variety of phases that defy our current understanding ( e.g. quark matter  @xcite ) . in the opposite regime , that of extremely low temperatures and densities , _ ultracold atomic gases _ trapped by electromagnetic fields are gradually becoming a paradigm of strongly - correlated behavior in quantum many - body physics  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the above condensed - matter and high - energy scenarios , ultracold atoms have a unique property : their microscopic properties can be fully characterized and controlled in experiments .",
    "this experimental control has reached such a status that the dream of exploiting a quantum system to understand the properties of a complex quantum many - body model ( i.e. a _ quantum simulator _",
    "@xcite ) is already an experimental reality  @xcite .",
    "ultracold gases of neutral atoms can be trapped in periodic optical potentials obtained from the interference of laser beams .",
    "the dynamics of the atoms in these _ optical lattices _ resembles that of tightly - bound electrons in metals , such that this system can be considered to be a synthetic solid whose dimensionality and lattice structure can be experimentally tailored , while the nuisance of impurities , disorder , or other uncontrolled microscopic degrees of freedom present in real solids , is totally absent . starting from this synthetic",
    "solid , it is possible to design a variety of quantum many - body models whose microscopic parameters can be experimentally characterized and controlled .",
    "for instance , the scattering of atoms leads to a short - range interaction that can be tuned all the way from weak to strong repulsion , such that the superfluid - insulator quantum phase transition of the bosonic  @xcite and fermionic  @xcite hubbard models becomes accessible to experiments . for sufficiently strong repulsion",

    ", we will combine this strongly - correlated behavior with external _ periodic drivings _ to obtain a flexible quantum simulator of quantum many - body models . in the context of optical lattices",
    ", there is a large body of relevant results regarding periodic drivings by modulations of the trapping optical potential .",
    "for instance , it is possible to periodically modulate the phase of the laser beams forming the optical lattice , as already demonstrated in experiments of chaotic dynamics with cold atoms  @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to modify the detuning of these laser beams linearly in time , usually referred to as lattice acceleration , which leads to a linear gradient ( i.e. constant force ) in the lattice reference frame , and gives rise to bloch oscillations  @xcite . from this perspective",
    ", the previous phase modulation  @xcite may also be interpreted as a periodic forcing .",
    "the combination of these two forces permitted probing the wannier - stark ladder spectrum  @xcite , and testing the phenomenon of coherent destruction of tunneling in the absence of the gradient  @xcite .",
    "recently  @xcite , a state - dependent coherent destruction of tunneling has been demonstrated in optical lattices by using a modulated magnetic field gradient instead of the phase modulation . in presence of an energy gradient , one study",

    ". we shall be particularly interested in such photon - assisted tunneling effect , whereby the atoms can tunnel in the presence of an energy penalty ( i.e. the linear gradient ) by absorbing photons from the external driving ( i.e. the periodic phase modulation ) .",
    "photon - assisted tunneling ( pat ) by phase modulation has also turned out to be a useful tool for quantum simulations .",
    "the dependence of the dressed tunneling on the modulation parameters has been used to drive the system across the superfluid - insulator transition  @xcite , and to control the tunneling anisotropy of bose - hubbard models in triangular lattices leading to magnetic frustration  @xcite .",
    "a subject of research that has received considerable attention recently is the quantum simulation of orbital magnetism , whereby the atoms mimic the behavior of electrons in solids subjected to additional magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "since the atoms are neutral , one must design specific schemes to simulate the effect of artificial / synthetic magnetic fields  @xcite , and pat by phase modulation has also been exploited in this respect ( see  @xcite for a recent review that also covers schemes that do not exploit pat ) . when the phase modulation leads to an inhomogeneous periodic forcing  @xcite , it is possible to dress the tunneling with an effective complex phase . unfortunately , this simple proposal does not allow for the quantum simulation of synthetic magnetic fields  @xcite , and alternative schemes have been considered . for instance , two - tone phase modulations lead to synthetic fluxes in arbitrary lattices  @xcite , while the simpler single - tone phase modulations yield staggered fluxes in certain types of lattices  @xcite .    a different possibility would be to abandon the periodic phase modulation , and investigate other types of drivings that can lead to the aforementioned synthetic gauge fields . instead of modulating the phase of the optical lattice , one can introduce a periodic driving by considering a bi - chromatic deep optical lattice , which can lead to staggered synthetic fluxes  @xcite . alternatively , a simple periodic driving by using a pair of slightly detuned and weaker raman beams ( i.e. a shallow _ moving optical lattice _ ) , which has been considered in the context of pat for trapped ions  @xcite , ultracold atoms  @xcite , and generic lattice models  @xcite that can be applied to a variety of contexts . for ultracold atoms ,",

    "the atoms tunnel in the presence of an energy penalty ( i.e. again , a linear gradient ) by absorbing photons from the external periodic driving ( i.e. this time , the moving optical lattice ) , and acquire a peierls phase that plays the role of a synthetic gauge field , and depends upon the wavevectors of the raman beams .    in this work",
    ", we explore a modification of this scheme by considering that the energy penalty can also be caused by the on - site hubbard interactions , yielding a _ hubbard blockade _ that inhibits the tunneling of atoms involving double occupation of a lattice site .",
    "the combination of this hubbard blockade with the periodic driving by a moving optical lattice will induce an _ interaction - dependent photon - assisted tunneling_. let us note that the interplay of hubbard interactions , linear gradients , and phase modulation of the optical lattice , has been shown to be responsible for interaction - shifted resonances in the pat of bose - hubbard dimers  @xcite and chains  @xcite .",
    "similar effects have been observed experimentally by considering a periodic modulation of the intensity of the optical - lattice laser beams  @xcite , rather than the aforementioned phase modulation .",
    "this interaction - dependent pat can lead to new schemes to control effective magnetic hamiltonians  @xcite , or to methods that enhance the effects of three - body interactions  @xcite .",
    "we should also mention other proposals that are relevant for the particular subject of our work . these concern",
    "the engineering of density - dependent tunnelings by either combining laser - assisted schemes with state - dependent lattices  @xcite in the spirit of the original proposal  @xcite , or a periodic modulation of the hubbard interactions  @xcite .    in this work",

    "the scheme can be applied to other setups , provided that the relevant dynamics can be described by a lattice model , and one can control the periodic driving and the strong interactions .",
    "this might be the case of trapped - ion crystals , where the local vibrations and electronic states lead to a lattice model with bosonic and pseudospin degrees of freedom , and the interactions and periodic drivings are provided by their interaction with laser beams.a similar situation arises for superconducting circuits by considering photons in arrays of microwave cavities and superconducting qubits leading to the aforementioned lattice models .    _",

    "<S> we show that , in a certain regime , this quantum simulator yields an effective hubbard hamiltonian with tunable bond - charge interactions , a model studied in the context of strongly - correlated electrons . in a different regime , we show how to exploit a correlated destruction of tunneling to explore nagaoka ferromagnetism at finite hubbard repulsion . by changing the photon - assisted tunneling parameters , </S>",
    "<S> we can also obtain a @xmath0-@xmath1 model with independently controllable tunneling @xmath0 , super - exchange interaction @xmath1 , and even a heisenberg - ising anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the full phase diagram of this paradigmatic model becomes accessible to cold - atom experiments , departing from the region @xmath2 allowed by standard single - band hubbard hamiltonians in the strong - repulsion limit . </S>",
    "<S> we finally show that , by generalizing the photon - assisted tunneling scheme , the quantum simulator yields models of dynamical gauge fields , where atoms of a given electronic state dress the tunneling of the atoms with a different internal state , leading to peierls phases that mimic a dynamical magnetic field . </S>"
