    "thermodynamics is a macroscopic description of a physical system , taking the average of its microscopic degrees of freedom in both the spatial and the temporal directions .",

    "is realized when the temporal average is taken sufficiently longer than any relaxation times of the system .",
    "this is characterized as the configuration which maximizes the total entropy . in usual observations , however , the time average is not taken for such a long time , so the materials we often encounter are not in global equilibrium and are regarded as being in the process of regression to equilibrium .",

    "suppose that we divide the system into subsystems of small size ( but still sufficiently large that thermodynamic descriptions work ) .",
    "then , due to the locality , one may assume that each subsystem gets into equilibrium rapidly .",

    "material particle_.    in the standard description of relativistic fluid mechanics , one adopts the formulation based on conserved currents @xcite ( for recent developments , see @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "they obey the following @xmath8 conservation laws : @xmath9 meanwhile , thermodynamic arguments based on the second law of thermodynamics ( with a few natural assumptions ) tell us that the @xmath5 fundamental variables can be written only with @xmath8 variables ( and their spatial derivatives ) , and thus the conservations ( [ fund_eq ] ) are indeed enough for describing the dynamics of relativistic fluids .",
    "the method described in the previous paragraph is actually powerful and can be applied to a wide class of continuum materials .",
    "however , it is rather difficult to see what actually happens entropically in the process of regression to the global minimum . in particular , the link between onsager s idea of linear regression @xcite and the current conservations has not been given in a direct manner so far .",

    "we show that linear regression to the global equilibrium can be naturally represented in the form of current conservations with dissipative currents in the desired form .",
