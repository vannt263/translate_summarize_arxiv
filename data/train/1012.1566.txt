    "systems with long - range interactions have recently been the object of an intense activity @xcite .",
    "these systems are numerous in nature and concern different disciplines such as astrophysics ( galaxies ) @xcite , two - dimensional turbulence ( vortices ) @xcite , biology ( chemotaxis ) @xcite , plasma physics @xcite and modern technologies such as free electron lasers ( fel ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , their study is interesting at a conceptual level because it obliges to go back to the foundations of statistical mechanics and kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "indeed , systems with long - range interactions exhibit a number of unusual features that are not present in systems with short - range interactions .",
    "for example , their equilibrium statistical mechanics is marked by the existence of spatially inhomogeneous equilibrium states @xcite , unusual thermodynamic limits @xcite , inequivalence of statistical ensembles @xcite , negative specific heats @xcite , various kinds of phase transitions @xcite etc .",
    "their dynamics is also very interesting because these systems can be found in long - lived quasi stationary states ( qss ) that are different from boltzmann equilibrium states .",
    "these qsss can be interpreted as stable steady states of the vlasov equation which governs the evolution of the system for sufficiently `` short '' times before correlations have developed @xcite .",
    "in fact , for systems with long - range interactions , the collisional relaxation time towards the boltzmann distribution increases rapidly with the number of particles @xmath7 and diverges at the thermodynamic limit @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the domain of validity of the vlasov equation is huge and the qsss have very long lifetimes . in many cases ,",
    "they are the only observable structures in a long - range system , so that they are often more physically relevant than the boltzmann equilibrium state itself .",
    "a question that naturally emerges is whether one can predict the qss actually reached by the system .",
    "this is not an easy task since the vlasov equation admits an infinite number of stable steady states in which the system can be trapped @xcite . in a seminal paper ,",
    "lynden - bell @xcite proposed to determine the qss eventually reached by the system by developing a statistical mechanics of the vlasov equation . to that purpose",
    ", he introduced the notions of phase mixing , violent relaxation and coarse - grained distributions .",
    "he obtained the most probable distribution by maximizing a boltzmann - type entropy while conserving all the constraints of the vlasov equation ( in particular the infinite class of casimirs ) . by definition ,",
    "this `` most mixed state '' is the statistical equilibrium state of the vlasov equation ( at a coarse - grained scale ) .",
    "whether or not the system truly reaches this equilibrium state relies on an assumption of ergodicity and efficient mixing .",
    "this ergodicity assumption is not always fulfilled in the process of violent relaxation and the lynden - bell prediction may fail . in that case , the qss can be another stable steady state of the vlasov equation that is incompletely mixed .",
    "this is referred to as incomplete relaxation ( see , e.g. @xcite , for discussion and further references ) . in case of incomplete relaxation , the prediction of the qss is very difficult , and presumably impossible .",
    "nevertheless , in many cases , the lynden - bell approach gives a fine first order prediction of the achieved qss and allows one to predict out - of - equilibrium phase transitions between different types of structures that can be compared with direct simulations or experiments . before addressing this problem in a specific situation , namely the hamiltonian mean field ( hmf ) model @xcite ,",
    "let us first briefly review the successes and the weaknesses of the lynden - bell approach .",
    "lynden - bell s statistical theory of violent relaxation was elaborated in the context of 3d stellar systems .",
    "unfortunately , this is the worse situation for its practical application .",
    "indeed , the predicted distribution function has infinite mass ( the spatial density decreases at large distances like @xmath9 ) . in other words",
    ", this means that there is no entropy maximum for a stellar system in an infinite domain @xcite .",
    "this is a clear evidence of the fact that galaxies have necessarily reached a state of _ incomplete _ violent relaxation .",
    "in fact , the lynden - bell theory is able to explain the isothermal core of elliptical galaxies without recourse to collisions that operate on a much longer timescale ( of the order of the chandrasekhar relaxation time @xcite ) .",
    "this is usually recognized as a major success of the theory",
    ". unfortunately , it fails at predicting the structure of the halo whose velocity distribution is anisotropic and whose spatial density decreases like @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "models of incomplete violent relaxation have been elaborated by bertin & stiavelli @xcite , stiavelli & bertin @xcite and hjorth & madsen @xcite .",
    "these models are able to reproduce the de vaucouleurs law of elliptical galaxies and provide a very good agreement with numerical simulations up to nine orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "another possibility to describe incomplete relaxation is to develop a kinetic theory of violent relaxation in order to understand what limits mixing @xcite .",
    "the idea is that , in case of incomplete relaxation ( non - ergodicity ) , the prediction of the qss is impossible without considering the dynamics @xcite . finally , in more academic studies @xcite",
    ", one can confine the system within an artificial spherical box and assume a complete relaxation inside the box . since the lynden - bell distribution is similar to the fermi - dirac statistics ( in the two - levels approximation )",
    ", the problem is mathematically equivalent to the study of a gas of self - gravitating fermions in a box .",
    "this theoretical problem has been studied in detail by chavanis @xcite .",
    "the caloric curve @xmath0 displays a rich variety of microcanonical and canonical phase transitions ( zeroth and first order ) between gaseous ( non degenerate ) and condensed ( degenerate ) states , depending on the value of a degeneracy parameter related to the initial distribution function @xmath1 in the lynden - bell theory .",
    "in particular , there exists two critical points in the phase diagram , one in each ensemble , at which the phase transitions are suppressed . for details about these phase transitions , and for an extended bibliography , we refer to the review @xcite .",
    "the lynden - bell prediction has also been tested in 1d and 2d gravity @xcite where the infinite mass problem does not arise @xcite .",
    "however , it is found again that relaxation is incomplete and that the lynden - bell prediction fails .",
    "finally , arad & lynden - bell @xcite have shown that the theory itself presents some inconsistencies arising from its non - transitive nature .",
    "these negative results have led many astrophysicists to the conclusion that the lynden - bell theory does not work in practice @xcite .",
    "a similar statistical theory has been developed by miller @xcite , and independently by robert & sommeria @xcite , in 2d turbulence in order to explain the robustness of long - lived vortices in astrophysical and geophysical flows ( a notorious example being jupiter s great red spot ) .",
    "large - scale vortices are interpreted as quasi stationary states of the 2d euler equation in the same way that galaxies are quasi stationary states of the vlasov equation ( see @xcite for a discussion of the numerous analogies between the statistical mechanics and the kinetic theory of 2d vortices and stellar systems ) .",
    "miller - robert - sommeria ( mrs ) developed a statistical theory of the 2d euler equation in order to predict the most probable state achieved by the system .",
    "although situations of incomplete relaxation have also been evidenced in 2d turbulence @xcite , the mrs theory has met a lot of success .",
    "for example , it is able to account for geometry induced phase transitions between monopoles and dipoles as we change the aspect ratio of the domain @xcite .",
    "phase transitions and bifurcations between different types of flows have also been studied in @xcite . on the other hand , when applied to geophysical and astrophysical flows , the mrs theory is able to account for the structure and the organization of large - scale flows such as jovian jets and vortices @xcite and fofonoff flows in oceanic basins @xcite .",
    "this theory has also been applied to more complicated situations such as 2d magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) @xcite and axisymmetric flows ( the celebrated von krmn flow ) @xcite .    a toy model of systems with long - range interactions , called the hamiltonian mean field ( hmf ) model , has been introduced in statistical physics @xcite and extensively studied @xcite .",
    "it can be viewed as a @xmath11 spin system with infinite range interactions or as a one dimensional model of particles moving on a ring and interacting via a long - range potential truncated to one fourier mode ( cosine potential ) . in that second interpretation",
    ", it shares many analogies with self - gravitating systems @xcite but is much simpler to study since it avoids difficulties linked with the singular nature of the gravitational potential at the origin and the absence of a natural confinement @xcite .",
    "the observation of quasi stationary states in the hmf model @xcite was a surprise in the community of statistical mechanics working on systems with long - range interactions .",
    "it was recognized early that these qsss are out - of - equilibrium structures and that they are non - boltzmannian .",
    "they were first interpreted @xcite in terms of tsallis generalized thermodynamics @xcite with the argument that the system is nonextensive so that boltzmann statistical mechanics is not applicable .",
    "later , inspired by analogies with stellar systems and 2d vortices reported in @xcite , different groups started to interpret these qsss in terms of stable steady states of the vlasov equation and statistical equilibrium states in the sense of lynden - bell @xcite .",
    "chavanis @xcite studied out - of - equilibrium phase transitions in the hmf model by analogy with similar studies in astrophysics and hydrodynamics @xcite and obtained a phase diagram in the @xmath12 plane why these control parameters are the proper ones to consider in the lynden - bell theory . ] between magnetized ( @xmath13 ) and non - magnetized ( @xmath14 ) states .",
    "these regions are separated by a critical line @xmath15 that marks the domain of stability of the homogeneous phase .",
    "this critical line displays a turning point at @xmath16 leading to a phenomenon of _ phase reentrance _",
    "( as we reduce the energy , the homogeneous phase is successively stable , unstable and stable again ) .",
    "@xcite studied the validity of the lynden - bell prediction by performing careful comparisons with direct @xmath7-body simulations at @xmath17 and found a good agreement for initial magnetizations @xmath18 leading to spatially homogeneous lynden - bell distributions .",
    "this was interpreted as a result of incomplete relaxation in @xcite .",
    "chavanis & campa @xcite showed that polytropic ( tsallis ) distributions can provide a good description of qsss in some cases of incomplete relaxation . in their work ,",
    "tsallis distributions are justified not by the fact that the system is nonextensive but by the fact that the evolution is non - ergodic ( i.e. the system does not mix well ) . ]",
    "antoniazzi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained a phase diagram in the @xmath19 plane and showed that the system exhibits first and second order phase transitions separated by a tricritical point .",
    "finally , antoniazzi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite performed numerical simulations of the vlasov equation and found a good agreement with direct @xmath7-body simulations and lynden - bell s prediction for the explored range of parameters .",
    "a synthesis of these results was published in @xcite . in this paper , a more detailed discussion of phase transitions in the @xmath12 plane",
    "was given , showing the lines of first and second order phase transitions and the domains of metastability .",
    "on the other hand , a comparison between the phase diagrams in the @xmath12 and @xmath19 planes was made .",
    "it was stated , without rigorous justification , that the tricritical point in the @xmath19 plane corresponds to the turning point of the critical line @xmath15 in the @xmath12 plane , i.e. the point where the phase reentrance starts .",
    "these results were confronted to numerical simulations by staniscia _",
    "these simulations confirmed the existence of a reentrant phase in the very narrow region predicted by the theory @xcite but also showed discrepancies with the lynden - bell prediction ( such as an additional reentrant phase and a persistence of magnetized states in the _ a priori _ non - magnetized region ) that were interpreted as a result of incomplete relaxation .",
    "_ @xcite also determined the physical caloric curve @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the inverse kinetic temperature , in the region of the phase diagram displaying first and second order phase transitions , and reported the existence of a region of negative kinetic specific heat @xmath22 . in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", the thermodynamical caloric curve @xmath0 was determined in the same region of parameters and it was shown that the thermodynamical specific heat @xmath23 is always positive , even in the region where the kinetic specific heat is negative .",
    "in particular , it is argued that the ensembles are equivalent although the experimentally measured specific heat is negative .",
    "these various results show that the description of out - of - equilibrium phase transitions in the hmf model is extremely rich and subtle . in this paper , we describe in more detail the phase transitions between magnetized and non - magnetized states in the @xmath12 plane .",
    "in particular , we plot the series of equilibria @xmath0 for different values of @xmath1 and determine the caloric curve corresponding to fully stable states .",
    "this completes and illustrates our previous study @xcite where only the final phase diagram was reported .",
    "we evidence different regions in the parameter space where the nature of phase transitions changes : ( i ) for @xmath24 , the system displays a second order phase transition ; ( ii ) for @xmath25 , the system displays a second order phase transition and a first order phase transition ; ( iii ) for @xmath26 , the system displays two second order phase transitions ; ( iv ) for @xmath27 , there is no phase transition . the passage from a first order phase transition to",
    "a second order phase transition corresponds to a tricritical point .",
    "the sudden appearance of two second order phase transitions from nothing corresponds to a second order azeotropy .",
    "this is associated with a phenomenon of phase reentrance .",
    "when we take into account metastable states , the description is even richer and seven regions must be considered ( see sec .",
    "[ sec_description ] ) .",
    "in particular , we find a new situation of phase reentrance .",
    "we also stress two unexpected results that were not reported ( or incorrectly reported ) in previous works : ( i ) contrary to what is stated in @xcite , there exists a region of ensembles inequivalence but it concerns an extremely narrow range of parameters so that the conclusions of @xcite are not altered ; ( ii ) the tricritical point separating second and first order phase transitions does not exactly coincide with the turning point of the stability line @xmath15 , contrary to what is stated in @xcite , but is slightly different .",
    "again , the difference is small so that the main results of previous works are not affected .",
    "however , this slight difference leads to an even richer variety of phase transitions .",
    "we may be fascinated by the fact that so many things happen in such a very narrow range of parameters ( typically @xmath28 ) although @xmath1 can take _ a priori _ any value between @xmath29 and @xmath30 ! finally , we make clear in this paper ( see sec .",
    "[ sec_lbt ] ) that the relevant control parameters associated with the lynden - bell theory are @xmath12 @xcite while the use of the variables @xmath19 @xcite may lead to physical inconsistencies in the thermodynamical analysis .",
    "the hmf model @xcite , which shares many similarities with gravitational and charged sheet models , describes the one - dimensional motion of @xmath7 particles of unit mass moving on a unit circle and coupled through a mean field cosine interaction .",
    "the system hamiltonian reads @xmath31 where @xmath32 represents the angle that particle @xmath33 makes with an axis of reference and @xmath34 stands for its velocity .",
    "the @xmath35 factor in front of the potential energy corresponds to the kac prescription to make the system extensive and justify the validity of the mean field approximation in the limit @xmath36 .",
    "the relevant order parameter is the magnetization defined as @xmath37 where @xmath38 . in the @xmath36 limit , the time evolution of the one body distribution function @xmath39 is governed by the vlasov equation @xmath40\\sin\\theta - m_y[f]\\cos\\theta)\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v}=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41=\\int f(\\theta , v , t)\\cos\\theta\\ , d\\theta dv$ ] and @xmath42=\\int f(\\theta , v , t)\\sin\\theta\\ , d\\theta dv$ ] are the two components of the magnetization .",
    "the statistical theory of the vlasov equation , introduced by lynden - bell @xcite , has been reviewed in several papers @xcite so that we shall here only recall the main lines that are important to understand the sequel .",
    "we assume that the initial distribution function takes only to values @xmath43 .",
    "for example , it can be made of one or several patches of uniform distribution @xmath44 surrounded by `` vacuum '' @xmath45 .",
    "we note that the number and the shape of these patches can be completely arbitrary . for such initial conditions ,",
    "the quantities conserved by the vlasov equation are : ( i ) the value @xmath1 of the initial distribution ; ( ii ) the normalization @xmath46 ; ( iii ) the energy @xmath47 .",
    "the fine - grained distribution function @xmath39 is stirred in phase space but conserves its two values @xmath1 and @xmath29 at any time , i.e. @xmath48 @xmath49 . however , as time goes on , the two levels values @xmath1 and @xmath29 become more and more intermingled as a result of a mixing process ( filamentation ) in phase space",
    ". the coarse - grained distribution @xmath50 , which can be viewed as a local average of the fine - grained distribution function , takes values intermediate between @xmath29 and @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath51 .",
    "it is expected to achieve a steady state @xmath52 as a result of violent relaxation on a relatively short timescale ( a few dynamical times ) .",
    "this corresponds to the qss observed in the simulations .",
    "the most probable , or most mixed state , is obtained by maximizing the lynden - bell entropy @xmath53 while conserving @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( for a given value of @xmath1 ) .",
    "this determines the statistical equilibrium state of the vlasov equation .",
    "note that the whole theory relies on an assumption of ergodicity , i.e. efficient mixing .",
    "our aim here is not to determine the range of validity of the lynden - bell theory , so that we shall assume that this assumption is fulfilled ( see , e.g. @xcite , for a discussion of incomplete relaxation in the hmf model ) .",
    "we are led therefore to considering the maximization problem @xmath56\\ , | \\ , e[\\overline{f}]=e , { \\cal m}[\\overline{f}]=1\\right\\rbrace,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a given value of @xmath1 .",
    "the critical points of ( [ lbt4 ] ) , canceling the first order variations of the constrained entropy , are given by the variational principle @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are lagrange multipliers .",
    "this yields the lynden - bell distribution @xmath60 where @xmath61\\cos\\theta - m_y[\\overline{f}_{lb}]\\sin\\theta$ ] is the individual energy .",
    "in the two - levels approximation , the lynden - bell distribution is formally identical to the fermi - dirac statistics @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath62 is the _",
    "thermodynamical temperature_. since the distribution function ( [ lbt6 ] ) is non - boltzmannian , the thermodynamical temperature differs from the _ classical kinetic temperature _ @xmath63 .",
    "this point has been studied specifically in @xcite .",
    "the maximization problem ( [ lbt4 ] ) corresponds to the microcanonical ensemble ( mce ) .",
    "since the lynden - bell theory is based on the vlasov equation that describes an isolated system , the microcanonical ensemble is the relevant ensemble to consider ( the energy is fixed ) .",
    "we can , however , formally define a canonical ensemble .",
    "we introduce the free energy functional @xmath64=s[\\overline{f}]-\\beta e[\\overline{f}]$]=e[f]-ts[f]$ ] .",
    "however , the massieu function @xmath65=-\\beta f[f]$ ] turns out to be more convenient in the analysis of phase transitions ( see , e.g. @xcite ) since it corresponds to the direct legendre transform of the entropy with respect to the energy . since @xmath66 $ ] and @xmath65 $ ] are equivalent ( recall that @xmath58 is fixed in the canonical ensemble )",

    "the maximization problems ( [ lbt4 ] ) and ( [ lbt7 ] ) have the same critical points since the variational principle @xmath69 returns eq .",
    "( [ lbt5 ] ) ( recall that @xmath58 is fixed in the canonical ensemble ) .",
    "in addition , it can be shown at a general level @xcite that a solution of the canonical problem ( [ lbt7 ] ) is always a solution of the more constrained dual microcanonical problem ( [ lbt4 ] ) , but that the reciprocal is wrong in case of ensembles inequivalence .",
    "is necessarily positive in ce while it can be positive or negative in mce . ] therefore , even if the canonical ensemble is not physically justified in the context of lynden - bell s theory of violent relaxation , it provides nevertheless a _ sufficient _ condition of microcanonical thermodynamical stability .",
    "it is therefore useful in that respect .",
    "in addition , it is interesting on a conceptual point of view to study possible inequivalence between microcanonical and canonical ensembles . therefore , we shall study in this paper the two maximization problems ( [ lbt4 ] ) and ( [ lbt7 ] ) , while emphasis and illustrations will be given for the more physical microcanonical case .    before that , let us recall general notions that will be useful in the sequel ( for an extended account , see e.g. @xcite ) . for a given value of @xmath1 ,",
    "the _ series of equilibria _ is the curve @xmath0 containing all the _ critical points _ of ( [ lbt4 ] ) or ( [ lbt7 ] ) ( as we have seen , they are the same ) .",
    "the stable part of this curve , in each ensemble , gives the corresponding _",
    "caloric curve_. in mce , the control parameter is the energy and the stable states are maxima of entropy @xmath70 at fixed energy and normalization .",
    "this defines the microcanonical caloric curve @xmath0 . in ce ,",

    "@xmath1 , we can describe changes from different kinds of phase transitions at some _ critical values _ of @xmath1 and plot the corresponding _",
    "phase diagrams _ @xmath12 and @xmath82 in microcanonical and canonical ensembles .",
    "this is the programm that we shall follow in this paper .",
    "we emphasize that these general results are valid for the caloric curve @xmath0 where @xmath58 is the inverse thermodynamical temperature , not the inverse kinetic temperature .",
    "in particular , the thermodynamical specific heat @xmath23 is always positive in the canonical ensemble while the kinetic specific heat @xmath83 can be positive or negative in the canonical ensemble .",
    "this has been illustrated in @xcite .",
    "a last comment is in order .",
    "if we consider a waterbag initial condition in which @xmath84 in the rectangle @xmath85\\times [ -v_{min},v_{max}]$ ] and @xmath86 outside , it seems convenient to take as control parameters the initial magnetization @xmath6 and the energy @xmath54 as done in @xcite . indeed , the specification of these parameters determines @xmath87 and @xmath54 and thus allows to compute the corresponding lynden - bell state .",
    "therefore , it seems that the choice of the control parameters @xmath88 or @xmath89 is just a question of commodity .",
    "in fact , this is not the case , and we would like to point out some difficulties in taking @xmath88 as control parameters in the thermodynamical analysis :    \\(i ) the control parameters @xmath88 are less general than @xmath89 because they assume that the initial condition is a waterbag distribution , whereas the control parameters @xmath89 are valid for _ any _ initial distribution with two levels , whatever the number of patches and their shape .",
    "they allow therefore to describe a wider class of situations .",
    "\\(ii ) the variables @xmath88 may lead to redundancies because there may exist two ( or more ) couples @xmath90 and @xmath91 that correspond to the _ same _ @xmath89 and , consequently , to the _ same _ lynden - bell state ( recall that the lynden - bell prediction only depends on @xmath54 and @xmath1 ) . and",
    "@xmath91 can lead to different results , although the lynden - bell theory leads to the same prediction .",
    "this could be interesting to check .",
    "] this has been illustrated in @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) more importantly , the use of @xmath6 as an external parameter ( instead of @xmath1 ) leads to physical inconsistencies in the thermodynamical analysis . indeed ,",
    "if we work in terms of the variables @xmath88 , the initial value of the distribution @xmath1 becomes a function @xmath87 of these variables . as a result ,",
    "the lynden - bell entropy functional @xmath92 depends not only of the external parameter @xmath6 but also on the energy @xmath54 .",
    "this is clearly a very unconventional situation . indeed ,",
    "if we want to apply the standard results recalled above , the entropic functional can depend on an external parameter but it can not explicitly depend on the energy .",
    "therefore , these general results @xcite are not valid for functionals of the form ( [ lbt9 ] ) .",
    "in particular , the `` improper '' caloric curve @xmath0 at fixed @xmath6 can display a region of negative specific heat while the proper caloric curve @xmath0 at fixed @xmath1 does not .",
    "this is exemplified in fig .",
    "1(b ) of @xcite where the entropy versus energy is plotted at fixed @xmath6 . this curve has a convex dip ( revealing a negative specific heat region ) , while the curve @xmath93 at fixed @xmath1 has no convex dip and the ensembles are equivalent @xcite .",
    "finally , in the other contexts where the lynden - bell theory has been applied @xcite , the control parameters that have been taken are @xmath54 and @xmath1 .",
    "it is therefore important to describe the phase transitions in terms of these parameters as initiated in @xcite .",
    "in fig . [ f_0-u_2 ] , we reproduce the microcanonical phase diagram obtained in @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ f_0-u - zoom ] , we enlarge this diagram close to the turning point of energy @xmath16 in order to show that its structure is more complicated than previously thought . similarly , in figs . [ f_0-beta ] and [ f_0-beta_2 ] , we plot the canonical phase diagram and its enlargement close to the turning point of temperature @xmath94 .",
    "these phase diagrams show that we must consider different regions where the nature of phase transitions changes .    in the following sections , we plot the series of equilibria @xmath0 in seven characteristic regions of the phase diagram and describe the corresponding phase transitions .",
    "the branches ( s ) correspond to fully stable states , the branches ( m ) correspond to metastable states and the branches ( u ) correspond to unstable states . at the end of each subsection , we summarize the nature of phase transitions in the corresponding region by considering only fully stable states",
    ".    we will find that the microcanonical and canonical phase transitions are very similar .",
    "in fact , the ensembles differ only in a very small range of parameters . therefore , we will essentially focus on the microcanonical ensemble and only mention the canonical ensemble in case of ensembles inequivalence .     @xcite .",
    "we have also indicated the minimum accessible energy ( for homogeneous and inhomogeneous phases ) in the case where the initial condition is a rectangular waterbag initial condition .",

    "this means that violent relaxation is incomplete @xcite and that the system is trapped in a stable steady state of the vlasov equation that is not the most mixed ( i.e. lynden - bell ) state @xcite .",
    "recently , chavanis & campa @xcite have investigated the vlasov dynamical stability of polytropic ( or tsallis ) distributions and argued that polytropes with an index close to @xmath171 could provide an explanation of the curious anomalies observed in @xcite . in this work ,",

    "it would be interesting to extend their analysis ( restricted so far to initial conditions with magnetization @xmath169 ) so as to cover a wider range of parameters and see whether it can explain similarly the anomalies reported in @xcite .",
    "very recently , a mathematical `` tour de force '' has been accomplished by mouhot & villani @xcite who rigorously proved that systems with long - range interactions described by the vlasov equation possess some asymptotic `` stabilization '' property in large time , although the vlasov equation is time - reversible .",
    "more precisely , they show that if a stable steady state of the vlasov equation is slightly perturbed , the perturbation converges in a _ weak sense _ towards a steady distribution through phase mixing without the help of any extra diffusion or ensemble averaging .",
    "this is refered to as _ nonlinear landau damping_. this is a very important work that shades new light on the process of phase mixing and , consequently , on the nature of qsss . however , these authors criticize the lynden - bell approach arguing that there is no `` universal '' large time behavior of the solutions of the vlasov equation in terms of just the conservation laws and the initial datum . in their words : `` this seems to be bad news for the statistical theory of the vlasov equation pioneered by lynden - bell '' .",
    "although it is clear that the lynden - bell theory has some limitations due to incomplete relaxation ( lack of mixing / ergodicity ) @xcite , our series of works related to the hmf model @xcite , including the present effort , shows that the lynden - bell approach is able to make accurate predictions that are confirmed by direct numerical simulations .",
    "therefore , the lynden - bell theory remains a valuable tool even if it is difficult to specify its general domain of validity .",
    "in fact , mouhot & villani @xcite do not totally reject this statistical approach and point out limitations in the application of their results .",
    "in particular , their theory is based on smooth functions ( which is not the norm in statistical theories ) and landau damping is a thin effect which might be neglected when it comes to predict the `` final '' state in a `` turbulent '' situation ( which is precisely the aim of lynden - bell s statistical theory ) .",
