    "galaxy formation theories predict that galaxies form by the collapse of dark matter haloes when the density crosses a critical overdensity .",
    "baryonic matter falls into the gravitational potential driven by dark matter , cools down , forms stars and hence galaxies .",
    "the standard scenario predicts that the amount of baryons in a galactic halo should approximately be a constant fraction ( @xmath5 ) of the total halo mass ( dark matter + baryonic matter ) .",
    "this baryon - to - total halo mass fraction is known as the cosmic baryon fraction ( cbf ) . on the other hand ,",
    "observations have detected only a small fraction of this cbf .",
    "more than half of the baryons of cbf are missing from the galaxies according to soft x - ray absorption line @xcite and emission line searches @xcite in galactic haloes .",
    "this is an important problem for all galaxy formation studies , for with more than 50% of the baryon reservoir unaccounted for , the sources and sinks for forming stars become correspondingly uncertain .",
    "recent detection of substantial amounts of cooler gas within the halo virial radius fails to significantly alleviate this problem @xcite .",
    "although numerical simulations suggest the presence of hot coronal gas , it has been difficult to detect this gas due to the faintness of its x - ray emission",
    ". however , there are indeed recent observations which indicate the presence of significant amounts of hot coronal gas extended over a large region around massive spiral galaxies @xcite . also , the inferred ram pressure stripping of satellite galaxies around the milky way galaxy supports the presence of the hot halo gas with nearly flat density ( @xmath6 ) out to large galacto - centric radius @xcite .",
    "this gas , known as the circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) , may account for some of the missing baryons from the galaxies .",
    "the cgm is the gas surrounding the central , optically visible part of the galaxy within its host dark matter halo .",
    "this is the bridging medium that connects the interstellar medium ( ism ) to the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . during galactic evolution , the galaxy accretes matter from its surrounding igm and also ejects some material in the form of galactic winds resulting from feedback processes like supernovae ( sne ) and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the cgm , being the intermediate medium , is most affected by these processes and may contain important clues about galaxy evolution , making it a promising tool for the study of the processes affecting the galaxy evolution .",
    "the presence of the hot halo gas surrounding the galaxies , in the form of the cgm , causes the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) distortion of cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) .",
    "the thermal sz ( tsz ) distortion of the cmbr due to the cgm is small compared to the tsz distortion caused by the galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "the detectability of the tsz signal from a system can be enhanced by cross - correlating this signal with another signal originating from the same source like the distribution of haloes @xcite or the gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "we cross - correlate the tsz signal from the cgm with the distribution of the galaxies . the cross - power spectrum between the sz signal and distribution of galaxies",
    "can be thought of as the sz - galaxy cross power spectrum .",
    "it can be obtained by combining a high resolution a cmb survey such as spt ( south pole telescope ) with an overlapping optical survey .",
    "in addition to the sz - effect , the hot cgm also manifests itself in x - ray emission through bremsstrahlung . combining the x - ray observations with optically selected galaxies can give the x - ray - galaxy cross power spectrum , which enhances the detectability of the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "the x - ray emission from the cgm is more sensitive to the underlying gas distribution than the sz effect and it also breaks the degeneracy between the gas density and temperature which is present in the sz effect . here , we study the prospects for the cross - correlation of the soft x - ray emission from the cgm with the distribution of galaxies",
    ". this can be used as an additional probe to constrain the properties of the cgm .",
    "we also compute the x - ray - sz cross - power spectrum for the cgm .",
    "significant effort has been made to forecast / detect the x - ray - sz cross - correlation on large scales by cross - correlating the cmb maps generated by wmap ( wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe)/_planck _ surveys with the rosat ( rntgen satellite ) all sky survey @xcite .",
    "the x - ray - sz cross - correlation measured for the galaxy clusters is particularly useful to constrain the cosmological parameters as the number of clusters strongly depends on the underlying cosmology @xcite .",
    "we look into the possibility of detecting the contribution of the cgm to the x - ray - sz cross - power spectrum with spt and erosita ( extended roentgen survey with an imaging telescope array ) combination .",
    "simulations suggest that feedback processes are required to avoid the over - cooling problem and formation of excessively massive galaxies ( in terms of stellar mass ) .",
    "a number of feedback mechanisms have been proposed that reproduce many observed galaxy properties despite having different implementations and physical motivations behind them .",
    "the cgm , thus can provide additional constraints on these simulations as the cgm properties are largely affected by the variation in the feedback mechanism @xcite    this paper is organized as follows : in section-[sec - sze ] we describe the sz - effect . in section-[sec - szg ] we estimate the cross - correlation between the sz - effect from the hot cgm and the distribution of galaxies and forecast the detectability of the sz - galaxy cross power spectrum . in section-[sec - xr ] we describe the x - ray emission from the hot cgm and forecast the detectability of x - ray - galaxy cross power spectrum . in section-[sec - xsz ] we compute the x - ray - sz cross power spectrum . in section-[sec - forecast ] we forecast the constraints on the cgm properties . in section-[sec - feedback ] we discuss the possibility of differentiating between various feedback models . in section-[sec - conc ] we conclude by summarizing our main results .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that the mass fraction of the cgm is independent of the host halo mass .",
    "observations indicate that the fractional mass in the stellar component of galaxies is @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a fractional mass in gas , @xmath8 , as the total fractional mass in baryons in a galaxy is @xmath9 . due to the uncertainty in the amount of the cgm",
    ", we also calculate some key results with a smaller gas fraction , = 0.05 .",
    "we assume that the gas is uniformly distributed in the galactic halo with a temperature given by the virial temperature of the halo .",
    "we also show the effect of different density profiles of the cgm on its cross power spectrum .",
    "the cosmological parameters that we have used are driven by the joint analysis of cmb anisotropies along with observations from the baryon acoustic oscillations surveys .",
    "the resulting best fit cosmological parameters , especially @xmath10 , are in tension with those obtained from galaxy cluster and weak lensing studies . in particular",
    ", one can have a mismatch in the galaxy cluster counts by a factor of two due to the difference in the adopted value of @xmath10 .",
    "although , much efforts have been made to calibrate cluster masses @xcite , crucial for doing cosmology with clusters , the simplest explanation for the mismatch can be a remaining systematic mass bias at the galaxy cluster scales .",
    "similarly , unknown systematics can also lead to the amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum inferred from weak gravitational lensing to be lower than that inferred from cmb .",
    "however , this tension has been lifted to a certain extent by the ` first ' cosmological results from the dark energy survey ( des , which is one of the surveys that we consider in our analysis ) , where the estimated @xmath10 is consistent with the _ planck _ measurement @xcite .",
    "there are recent indications that masses estimated from velocity dispersions ( for galaxy clusters ) may have more robustness than previously envisaged @xcite .",
    "taking positively these developments , which bring increased consensus among different cosmological results , we adopt the _ planck _",
    "cmb cosmological parameters @xcite as our fiducial choices .",

    "the inverse compton scattering of the cmb photons by high energy electrons distorts the cmb spectrum giving rise to the tsz @xcite .",
    "the tsz effect is represented in terms of a dimensionless parameter , known as the compton y - parameter , defined as @xmath11 , which for a flat density and temperature profile becomes @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the thomson scattering cross section , @xmath14 is the gas temperature ( @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 is the electron density of the scattering medium , and @xmath17 is the distance travelled by the photons through the scattering medium .",

    "the sz signal is truncated at the virial radius . as the density profile becomes steeper from ( a ) to ( c ) the value of @xmath83 shifts from 12000 to 14000 whereas there are no oscillations in the case of profile-(c ) .",
    "this shift occurs since with the steepening of the density profile , the pressure at the virial radius decreases .    in figure-([fig - prf ] ) at small @xmath84-values ( @xmath95 ) , the sz cross power spectrum for the three density profiles are almost identical but there is a significant difference between the profiles near @xmath96 .",

    "but the inclusion temperature prior ( case ) improves the constraint on ( @xmath145= 0.041 ( 0.026 ) for sz - galaxy ( x - ray - galaxy ) cross - correlation ) and ( @xmath145= 0.52 ( 0.38 ) for sz - galaxy ( x - ray - galaxy ) cross - correlation ) significantly even in the absence of any prior on @xmath10 .",
    "these constraints are similar to the constraints on these parameters in the presence of _ planck _ prior on @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , the prior knowledge of one of the gas physics parameter helps in breaking the degeneracy between the cosmological and gas physics parameters .",
    "currently , there is a large uncertainty in the knowledge of the distribution of the cgm .",
    "simulations suggest that the extent and distribution of the cgm also depends on the feedback processes taking place in the central part of the galaxy @xcite . without any feedback , the temperature at outer radii falls rapidly , whereas the winds and agn feedback tend to make the profile flatter .",
    "the effect of the feedback on the density profile is however weaker than on the temperature profiles . in other words ,",
    "the pressure profile is likely to be flatter at the outer radii in the presence of the feedback processes than in the cases without any feedback .    in this section ,",
    "we investigate whether the sz / x - ray - galaxy cross power spectrum can distinguish between different density profiles of the cgm and hence the processes giving rise to these profiles . in order to constrain the density profile of the cgm , assuming the gas to be at the virial temperature , we now include in the fisher matrix analysis , where is defined by @xmath146^{-1 }   \\label{eqn - density}\\ ] ] where @xmath147 is the normalization such that the mass within the virial radius of the galaxy remains the same and the fiducial value of is 0 for the flat density profile . for the spt - des survey ,",
    "the uncertainty on the is large and it can at best be constrained to @xmath148 in the absence of any redshift evolution of and case .",
    "even when we include the redshift evolution of gas fraction and remove the prior on gas temperature , the uncertainty on degrades only slightly to @xmath149 .",
    "this shows that the sz - galaxy cross power spectrum is less sensitive to the density profile of the cgm as compared to other astrophysical parameters within the resolution of the spt ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "varying the density profile affects the sz - galaxy cross power spectrum only at large @xmath84-values and hence this situation can only be improved by a higher resolution cmb survey in the future .    on the other hand ,",
    "the x - ray emission which is proportional to the square of the density of the cgm , is much more sensitive to its density profile even at small @xmath84-values .",
    "also the resolution of the erosita ( @xmath150 ) is much better than the resolution of the spt . as a result , can be constrained to @xmath151 by the x - ray - galaxy cross power spectrum .",
    "this constraint remains almost invariant even if we fix in the case .",
    "in the case of a steeper density profile i.e. a larger value of , both the sz - galaxy and x - ray - galaxy cross power spectrum increase , specially at large @xmath84-values ( see figure-([fig - prf ] ) and ( [ fig - xprf ] ) ) .",
    "this results in an increased signal - to - noise ratio , as well as an improvement in the constraints on the parameters .",
    "for example , if we take = 2 , the constraint on improves to @xmath152 from the sz - galaxy cross power spectrum whereas the slope of the density profile can be constrained with an accuracy better than 5% ( i.e. @xmath153 ) from the x - ray - galaxy cross power spectrum .    in figure-([fig - gamma ] ) , we show the 68% cl ellipses for -from the spt - des and the erosita - des surveys . again , due to the more sensitive dependence of the x - ray emission on the cgm density profile as compared to the sz - effect , the uncertainty ellipses of the x - ray - galaxy cross - correlation are smaller and hence can constrain better than the sz - galaxy cross - correlation .",
    "this result has implications of being able to constrain the distribution and evolution of the cgm .",
    "recent simulations @xcite have shown that the feedback processes ( from star formation and agns ) can affect the density and temperature profiles of the cgm .",
    "these simulations match some of the observed properties of the cgm and galaxies .",
    "however , they are quite sensitive to the feedback mechanism used and give a variety of the cgm density and temperature profiles depending on the feedback process . the density profiles of the cgm in these simulations can be reasonably fit by @xmath154 , within the virial radius of the galaxy for various feedback processes .",
    "for example , the no agn , fixed - v hot winds and fully enriched winds models of @xcite can be fit with = 2 , 1.6 and 2.2 respectively ( excluding the central part ) . also the pressure profile for the massive galaxies from @xcite",
    "( see the first panel of figure-(3 ) of @xcite ) can be fit with a @xmath155 , assuming the gas to be at the virial temperature .",
    "therefore the x - ray - galaxy and sz - galaxy cross power spectrum have the potential of discriminating between the evolutionary processes for the cgm , at greater than @xmath4 , if @xmath156 can be constrained within @xmath157 .",
    "we have studied the cross - correlation power spectra for the sz - galaxy distribution , x - ray - galaxy distribution and x - ray - sz effect for the hot gas in the galactic haloes .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    1 .",
    "we predict that the sz - galaxy cross power spectrum is significant at small scales ( @xmath158 ) and can be detected at snr @xmath159 by combining the spt and des surveys for the massive galaxies at intermediate redshifts .",
    "the shape of the sz - galaxy cross - power spectrum is sensitive to the underlying distribution of the gas at large @xmath84-values ( @xmath160 ) .",

    ", we have considered the combination of the erosita - des and erosita - lsst surveys and these surveys can detect the signal at snr@xmath161 and @xmath162 respectively for the high mass and intermediate redshift galaxies .",
    "for the flat density profile , the shape of the x - ray - galaxy cross power spectrum is similar to the shape of the sz - galaxy cross power spectrum .",
    "however , the x - ray emission ( @xmath163 ) is more sensitive to the density profile than the sz - effect ( @xmath164 ) . as a result ,",
    "the x - ray - galaxy cross power spectrum vaires significantly with the steepening of the density profile even at @xmath165 .",
    "the possibility of detecting the x - ray - sz cross power spectrum from the cgm is low ( snr @xmath166 ) for the spt - erosita combination .",
    "this is due to the combined effect of the high noise in x - rays and low resolution of the spt survey .",
    "4 .   finally , we do a fisher matrix analysis for these surveys to forecast the constraints that can be derived on the amount of gas in the cgm .",
    "after marginalizing over the cosmological parameters with @xmath167 priors and combining the fisher matrix analysis for three different mass and redshift bin combinations , the spt - des survey can constrain to @xmath168% in the presence , and to @xmath169% in the absence , of any possible redshift evolution of the gas fraction .",
    "for the same set of mass and redshift bins , the erosita - des survey can constrain to @xmath169% and @xmath170% in the presence and absence of redshift evolution of gas fraction respectively . note that we neglect the correlation between the galaxies and the agns in the calculation of the uncertainties in the x - ray - galaxy cross - power spectrum .",
    "5 .   including the slope of the density profile ( defined in eq.[eqn - density ] ) in the fisher matrix analysis , degrades the constraints on other astrophysical parameters whereas itself can be constrained to @xmath171 ( @xmath172 ) by the x - ray ( sz)-galaxy cross power spectrum for the flat density profile .",
    "these constrains are sensitive to the fiducial value of and improve for a steeper density profile of the cgm . for = 2 , it can be constrained to @xmath153 ( @xmath173 ) by the x - ray ( sz)-galaxy cross power spectrum power spectrum .",
    "6 .   in all our calculations",
    ", we have assumed = 0.11 .",
    "if instead , we take a low value of the gas fraction in the cgm , e.g. @xmath174 , the sz cross - power spectrum and its detectability goes down roughly by a factor 2 as the sz signal is proportional to the amount of gas .",
    "so with @xmath174 , the peak snr @xmath175-@xmath176 for the spt - des survey .",
    "however , since the x - ray signal is proportional to @xmath177 , the x - ray cross power spectrum and its detectability goes down by a factor of 4 . as a result",
    ", the snr goes below @xmath178 for the erosita - des survey whereas this signal can still be detected at snr @xmath179 with the erosita - lsst combination .    presently , the amount of cgm in galactic haloes , its distribution , energetics and other properties are not well determined .",
    "therefore , the detection and study of the sz - galaxy and x - ray - galaxy cross power spectrum can provide powerful constraints on the nature of the cgm and open up the possibility of differentiating between various feedback models which affect the evolution of the cgm . + * acknowledgements * + we thank the anonymous referee for valuable suggestions and comments .",
