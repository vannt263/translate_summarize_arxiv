    "our theory of interest is witten s open bosonic string field theory  @xcite . in particular , we focus on the research inspired by  @xcite , where this theory was used to prove that the energy of the tachyon vacuum is minus the energy of the d-25 brane . there has been a good deal of progress made towards simplifying the original tachyon vacuum solution  @xcite .",
    "this simple solution is expressed in a language which makes use of an algebra of string fields called the @xmath0 algebra . despite the advantages of this approach",
    ", there are various problems that can arise when using the @xmath0 algebra to construct solutions other than the tachyon vacuum  @xcite .",
    "our attitude in this work is that these problems arise because the @xmath0 algebra is not large enough to properly describe all solutions of open string field theory .",
    "if one tries to construct an algebra of string fields in an arbitrary way , the star products between the elements will be too difficult to manage .",
    "therefore , in order to extend the @xmath0 algebra in a meaningful way , we must ask the question : under what conditions can one straightforwardly construct an algebra of string fields with manageable star products ? in the rest of this section we introduce one such family of states with simple star product structure .    consider the operator modes @xmath1 corresponding to a primary conformal field @xmath2 of weight @xmath3 .",
    "these modes may be written as @xmath4 where the contour of integration is along the complex unit circle unless otherwise specified . if we make a conformal transformation @xmath5 , then the transformed modes @xmath6 are given by @xmath7^{-h+1}[f(z)]^{n+h-1}\\phi(z).\\ ] ] it is convenient to introduce , so we have @xmath8 the modes @xmath6 can be decomposed into their left and right components , respectively given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes integration along the @xmath11 half of the complex unit circle and @xmath12 denotes integration along the @xmath13 half of the complex unit circle",
    ". therefore , the sum of the left and right components corresponds to integration along the entire complex unit circle , namely , .",
    "the left and right components of operators are interesting objects in string field theory because of their convenient properties with respect to the star product . for any string fields @xmath14 and @xmath15 , we have @xmath16 where in the last line we allow for a minus sign if both @xmath14 and @xmath17 are grassman odd .",
    "we now focus our attention to the left components @xmath18 .",
    "let us define the string fields @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the identity of the star product . using ( [ rule ] ) , we can compute the star commutator @xmath21 = [ \\tilde{\\phi}_m^l , \\tilde{\\phi}_n^l]\\ket{i}.\\ ] ] therefore , if we create an algebra of string fields with elements @xmath22 , then the star commutators can be entirely determined by evaluating the _ ordinary _ commutators .",
    "we now provide an explanation of the conditions under which ( [ lst ] ) can be written in terms of a closed algebra of string fields .",
    "suppose that @xmath2 belongs to a family of primary conformal fields indexed by a set @xmath23 , @xmath24 , such that @xmath25 = \\sum\\limits_{\\alpha\\in j}f^\\alpha_{mn}\\,\\phi^\\alpha_{m+n},\\ ] ] where the @xmath26 are constants and the modes @xmath27 correspond to @xmath28 .",
    "an important observation of this work is that there sometimes exists a conformal frame @xmath29 in which @xmath1 and @xmath18 satisfy the same algebra , meaning that @xmath30 & = \\sum\\limits_{\\alpha\\in j}f^\\alpha_{mn}(\\tilde{\\phi}^\\alpha_{m+n})^l , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the constants @xmath26 are the same in both cases.$ ] is computed in an arbitrary conformal frame , it is common to encounter anomalous terms proportional to @xmath31 or its derivatives . ] in this situation , it is straightforward to see that @xmath32 = \\sum\\limits_{\\alpha\\in j}f^\\alpha_{mn}(\\phi^\\alpha_{m+n})^l.\\ ] ] we refer to the algebra generated by ( [ 7 ] ) as the _ string field representation _ of the algebra ( [ phi - algebra ] ) with structure constants @xmath26 .",
    "this result answers the question posed at the beginning of this discussion . in particular , the condition ( [ tildelcom ] ) allows one to straightforwardly construct an algebra of string fields with manageable star products .",
    "the main observation of this work is that we have precisely the condition ( [ tildelcom ] ) for the matter plus ghost virasoro modes @xmath33 and the conformal frame .",
    "the modes @xmath33 satisfy the zero central charge virasoro algebra , which we now refer to simply as the virasoro algebra . if we let and define the string fields , then @xmath34 = ( m - n)\\mathbb{l}_{m+n}.\\ ] ] we call the algebra generated by ( [ strvir ] ) the string field representation of the virasoro algebra .",
    "naively , one would expect this discussion to be exactly the same for the right components .",
    "it is true that the modes @xmath35 satisfy the virasoro algebra , however , there is one interesting subtlety .",
    "define the string fields @xmath36 . using the rule ( [ rule ] ) , we find @xmath37 = -(m - n)\\mathbb{l}^*_{m+n}.\\ ] ] recall that the bpz dual of @xmath33 is given by @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , the bpz dual algebra is .",
    "we see from this observation that the algebra generated by ( [ bpz ] ) is actually the string field representation of the _ bpz dual algebra_.    this paper is outlined as follows . in section [ sec - lr ] , we prove the claim that @xmath33 together with the conformal frame satisfy the condition ( [ tildelcom ] ) . in section [ sec - extkbc ] , we discuss various options for extending the @xmath0 algebra . in section [ sec - app ] , we use our results to find novel algebraic solutions of open string field theory .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary of our results and comment on opportunities for future exploration .",
    "since we already know that , the main goal of this section is to show that .",
    "the first step towards showing these commutation relations is to explicitly express the operator modes @xmath39 as @xmath40 for the sake of brevity , we define @xmath41 an important property of the vector fields @xmath42 is that @xmath43 a quick but a bit formal argument for @xmath44 = ( m - n)\\mathcal{l}^l_{m+n}$ ] is to rewrite @xmath45 where we have introduced the holomorphic step function @xmath46 satisfying @xmath47 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 for .",
    "let us define @xmath50 .",
    "formally , or under suitable conditions , for any two such operators @xmath51 = -l_{[v , w]}$ ] , where @xmath52 = v \\partial w - w \\partial v$ ] denotes the lie bracket . applying this formula for two vector fields of the form @xmath53 one quickly establishes [ llcom ] [ _ m^l,_n^l ] = ( m - n)^l_m+n thanks to the identity [ vvid ] v_n(w ) v_m(w ) - v_m(w ) v_n(w ) = ( m - n ) v_n+m ( w ) and the formal properties of the holomorphic step function @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where especially the latter one may seem dubious .",
    "because of central importance of the equation ( [ llcom ] ) to this work , let us present a more rigorous derivation . to proceed",
    "we follow the standard contour argument with modifications due to the step functions which restrict both contours to semicircles as in figure [ fig - contours ] . by picking sufficiently small @xmath56 ,",
    "the commutator can be expressed as [ contour_argument ] [ _ m^l,_n^l ] = ( _ c_1+^r _ c_1^r - _ c_1-^r _ c_1^r ) v_m(z ) v_n(w ) t(z ) t(w ) . in analogy to the standard argument we can deform the @xmath57-variable contour @xmath58 into the @xmath59 contour so that they cancel each other .",
    "what remains is a sum of two terms @xmath60    i_1 & = & _ c_1^r v_n(w ) _",
    "c_w v_m(z ) t(z ) t(w ) , + [ i_2def ] i_2 & = & _ c_1^r v_n(w ) ( _ i - i^i+i + _ -i - i ^- i+i ) v_m(z ) t(z ) t(w ) . the first term @xmath61 is given by a small contour @xmath62 around the point @xmath63 .",
    "only the singular part of the zero - central - charge ope t(z)t(w ) ~ + contributes .",
    "the resulting contribution takes the form i_1 & = & _ c_1^r v_n(w ) + & = & _ c_1^r t(w ) + & & + v_n(i ) v_m(i ) t(i ) + v_n(-i ) v_m(-i ) t(-i ) , [ i_1res ] where in the second line we used integration by parts .",
    "the first term already accounts for our desired commutation relation ( [ llcom ] ) thanks to ( [ vvid ] ) .",
    "the last two terms are a contribution from the ends of the contour .",
    "they vanish since @xmath64 , but this computation also hints at possible problems . inserting the term @xmath61 inside a correlator with generic mid - point insertions at @xmath65 , the explicit appearance of @xmath66 on the right hand side of ( [ i_1res ] ) would lead to divergences and the final result would depend on the precise manner the various limits are taken . in this work",
    "we allow the probing operator to approach the midpoint at the very end , so that the midpoint contributions in ( [ i_1res ] ) are effectively absent .",
    "the second term @xmath67 is naively not contributing either , since the integration region is of vanishing size as @xmath68 is taken to zero .",
    "one must exercise a caution however , since the integrand of the double integral ( [ i_2def ] ) is divergent in the region @xmath69 where its leading singularity is given by ( t)^m+1 ( u)^n+1 t(u ) .",
    "here we parameterized @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "standard power - counting argument ",
    "assuming regular @xmath72shows however that the singularity is integrable , and hence the contribution from a vanishing size region is indeed vanishing . the easiest way to see this is by passing to radial coordinates in the @xmath73-@xmath74 plane . on the other hand , had we evaluated @xmath67 inside a correlator with midpoint insertions , we would have to replace @xmath72 by e.g. @xmath75 in case of a primary field , and @xmath67 would have been divergent , or at least prescription dependent .",
    "let us close this section by noting that similarly to ( [ ldef ] ) , we have @xmath76 where @xmath77 corresponds to integration along the @xmath13 half of the complex unit circle .",
    "we find the expected result @xmath78 = ( m - n)\\mathcal{l}_{m+n}^r.\\ ] ] one may also consider commutators involving both left and right components . using a similar analysis , we obtain .",
    "for the sake of the current paper , we do not consider such situations .",
    "however , this issue is a current topic of interest and will be addressed in  @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath79 = 0.\\ ] ]",
    "we first recall the most important results of sections [ sec - intro ] and [ sec - lr ] .",
    "we have shown that the strings fields form a representation of the virasoro algebra @xmath80 = ( m - n)\\mathbb{l}_{m+n}.\\ ] ] we have also seen that the string fields form a representation of the bpz dual algebra @xmath81 = -(m - n)\\mathbb{l}^*_{m+n}.\\ ] ] at this point we restrict our discussion for convenience to the virasoro algebra rather than its dual . however , similar remarks will hold if one wishes to formulate a theory using the bpz dual algebra .",
    "the string fields of the @xmath0 algebra are defined in our language as @xmath82 where as before the tilde refers to the operator expressed in the conformal frame .",
    "given our previous observations , it is clear that we may define an algebra of anticommuting string fields analogous to @xmath15 , given by @xmath83 so that @xmath84 .",
    "if we use the convention that all star commutators are graded by ghost number , then the standard algebraic properties of @xmath0 are @xmath85 & = 0 , & q\\mathbb{l}_{-1 }   & = 0 , \\nonumber\\\\ [ \\mathbb{l}_{-1 } , c ] & = \\partial c , & q\\mathbb{b}_{-1 } & = \\mathbb{l}_{-1},\\\\ [ \\mathbb{b}_{-1 } , c ] & = 1 , & qc & = c\\,\\mathbb{l}_{-1 } c , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 .",
    "we are now prepared to begin our discussion of extending the @xmath0 algebra .",
    "the most straightforward extension is to include all of the string fields @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",

    "in fact , a finite extension is often computationally easier to understand .",
    "the infinite extension was introduced first in order to develop all of the techniques necessary to deal with extended @xmath0 algebras .",
    "the virasoro algebra has two non - trivial finite subalgebras .",
    "the elements @xmath94 and @xmath95 form what is called @xmath96 , while @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath97 form the familiar @xmath98 algebra . by adding the @xmath99 counterparts to either @xmath96 or @xmath98 , one can create a finite extension of the @xmath0 algebra . however , it should be noted that one is not strictly limited to these cases . for the generating string fields one could instead choose various linear combinations of the elements in @xmath96 or @xmath98 .",
    "in fact , one of the early motivations for this work was the discovery of one of the @xmath96 linear combinations . consider the string field @xmath100 the string field @xmath10 has the interesting property that @xmath101 & = l^-k = k,\\\\ [ l , b ] & = l^-b = b,\\\\ [ l , c ] & = l^-c = -c , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where is the familiar derivation of the star algebra .",
    "therefore , adding @xmath10 to the @xmath0 algebra is effectively turning an exterior derivative into an interior derivative .",
    "the @xmath98 extension also has a nice physical interpretation .",
    "it is well - known that the string field @xmath102 acts as a generator of translations when acting on the string field @xmath103 , a fact which is expressed by the commutation relation @xmath104 = \\partial c$ ] .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath98 extension effectively adds the generators of dilation and special conformal transformation to the @xmath0 algebra . to see this ,",
    "let us use the convention that the generator @xmath105 associated with @xmath106 is defined implicitly by .",

    "the goal of this section is to show that we can use the extensions described in section [ sec - extkbc ] to construct new analytic solutions to the open string field theory equation of motion .",
    "we begin by reviewing important techniques for constructing solutions with the @xmath0 algebra .",
    "the modern method of constructing solutions is to start with the pure gauge ansatz , where @xmath112 is an appropriate function  @xcite of the string field @xmath102 .",

    "we first show how this solution nicely generalizes to the infinite extension of @xmath0 , which includes all of the string fields @xmath106 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 .",
    "we start with the pure gauge ansatz @xmath120 for a fixed choice of @xmath121 . the relationships ( [ newbig ] ) and ( [ spcon ] )",
    "tell us that for each fixed value of @xmath121 , the @xmath122 algebra behaves almost identically to the original @xmath0 algebra .",
    "therefore , we find that the pure gauge ansatz @xmath123 leads to the solution @xmath124    the computation and classification of all possible solutions using different representations of the @xmath0 algebra is certainly a project in itself , and therefore we do not attempt to perform such an analysis here .",
    "however , we conclude this work by drawing attention to some interesting solutions that are of a different form than ( [ bigsol ] ) .",
    "these solutions are perhaps best illustrated by focusing on an algebra similar to the one described in ( [ lminus ] ) .",

    "even with our prescribed ordering of the function @xmath129 , there is still some confusion that may arise when taking the @xmath102 derivative of a product of functions .",
    "consider two functions @xmath135 and @xmath136 of the type ( [ fkl ] ) .",
    "the correct product rule is @xmath137 = \\frac{\\partial a(k , l)}{\\partial k}b(k , l ) + a(k , l+1)\\frac{\\partial b(k , l)}{\\partial k}.\\ ] ] the above equation is actually quite intuitively pleasing . since passing @xmath102 through @xmath135 sends",

    "notice that we also have the freedom to consider a more general @xmath141 of the form @xmath142 where @xmath143 and @xmath144 are both functions of the string fields @xmath102 and @xmath10 .",
    "the inverse of this pure gauge choice is given by @xmath145 the solution @xmath114 looks somewhat more complicated because the summation prohibits some of our usual simplification tricks .",
    "however , it can still be written in the reasonably convenient form @xmath146 this is a convenient form because the term @xmath147 will not contribute to a computation of the energy .    by incorporating the new string field @xmath132",
