    "finite dynamical systems are time - discrete dynamical systems on finite state sets .",
    "well - known examples include cellular automata and boolean networks , which have found broad applications in engineering , computer science , and , more recently , computational biology .",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite for biological applications . )",
    "more general multi - state systems have been used in control theory @xcite , the design and analysis of computer simulations @xcite .",
    "one underlying mathematical question that is common to many of these applications is how to analyze the dynamics of the models without actually enumerating all state transitions , since enumeration has exponential complexity in the number of model variables .",
    "the present paper is a contribution toward an answer to this question .    for our purposes ,",
    "a finite dynamical system is a function @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a finite set @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath2 is generated by iteration of @xmath2 and is encoded in its _ phase space _ @xmath3 , which is a directed graph defined as follows .",
    "the vertices of @xmath3 are the elements of @xmath1 .",
    "there is a directed edge @xmath4 in @xmath3 if @xmath5 . in particular , a directed edge from a vertex to itself is admissible .",
    "that is , @xmath3 encodes all state transitions of @xmath2 , and has the property that every vertex has out - degree exactly equal to @xmath6 .",
    "each connected graph component of @xmath3 consists of a directed cycle , a so - called _ limit cycle _ , with a directed tree attached to each vertex in the cycle , consisting of the so - called _ transients_.",
    "any boolean network can be viewed as a finite dynamical system @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the finite field on two elements and @xmath9 . in this paper",
    ", we study finite dynamical systems @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is any finite field and @xmath12 .",
    "to be precise , we present a family of nonlinear finite systems for which the above question can be answered , that is , for which one can obtain information about the dynamics from the structure of the function .",
    "let @xmath13 , @xmath14 be a finite dynamical system .",
    "observe that @xmath2 can be described in terms of its coordinate functions @xmath15 , that is , @xmath16 .",
    "it is well known that any set - theoretic function @xmath17 can be represented by a polynomial in @xmath18 $ ] , see @xcite .",
    "this polynomial can be chosen uniquely so that any variable in it appears to a degree less than @xmath19 .",
    "that is , for any @xmath20 there is a unique @xmath21/\\langle x_i^q - x_i|i=1,\\ldots , n\\rangle$ ] , such that @xmath22 for all @xmath23 .",
    "consequently , any finite dynamical system over a finite field can be represented as a polynomial system .",
    "this is the point of view we take in this paper .    in the case",
    "that all the @xmath24 are linear polynomials without constant term , the dynamics of the _ linear system _ @xmath2 can completely be determined from its matrix representation @xcite .",
    "let @xmath25 be a matrix representation of a linear system @xmath26 .",
    "then the number of limit cycles and their length , as well as the structure of the transients , can be determined from the factorization of the characteristic polynomial of the matrix @xmath25 .",
    "the structure of the limit cycles had been determined earlier by elspas @xcite , and for affine systems by milligan and wilson @xcite .",
    "in this paper we focus on the class of nonlinear systems described by special types of polynomials , namely _ monomials_. that is , we consider systems @xmath27 , so that each @xmath24 is a polynomial of the form @xmath28 , or a constant . without loss of generality",
    "we can assume that no coordinate function is constant , since the general case is easily reduced to this .",
    "some classes of monomial systems and their dynamic behavior have been studied before : monomial cellular automata @xcite , boolean monomial systems @xcite , monomial systems over the p - adic numbers @xcite , and monomial systems over finite fields @xcite .    in @xcite a special class of boolean monomial systems",
    "was studied , namely those which have only fixed points as limit cycles , so - called _ fixed point systems_. the motivation for considering this class is the use of polynomial systems as models for biochemical networks .",
    "depending on the experimental system considered , such networks often exhibit steady state dynamics .",
    "that is , their dynamic models have phase spaces whose limit cycles are fixed points . for the purpose of model selection it would be useful to have a structural criterion to recognize fixed point systems .",
    "the main result of the present paper is to reduce this question for monomial systems over a general finite field @xmath11 to the same question for an associated boolean monomial system and a linear system over a ring of the form @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath30 be a polynomial system , with each @xmath24 a monomial , that is , @xmath31 , with @xmath32 a nonnegative integer .",
    "that is , @xmath2 can be described by the exponent matrix @xmath33 .",
    "we first associate with @xmath2 a boolean monomial system @xmath34 and a linear system @xmath35 over the ring @xmath36 .",
    "recall from @xcite that @xmath2 is called a _ fixed point system _ if all limit cycles of @xmath2 consist of a fixed point .",
    "we will show that @xmath2 is a fixed point system if and only if @xmath34 and @xmath35 are fixed point systems .    for @xmath37 , we define support @xmath38 , denoted by @xmath39 , to be @xmath40 , where @xmath41    the monomial system @xmath42 induces a boolean monomial system @xmath43 on @xmath44 by setting @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "[ t ] there is a commutative diagram @xmath48    the proof is a straightforward verification , since @xmath49    since @xmath50 on the set of all @xmath38 such that @xmath51 , the following corollaries are straightforward .    [ cor-1 ] the phase space of @xmath34 is a subgraph of the phase space of @xmath2 .",
    "suppose that @xmath34 is a fixed - point system .",
    "if @xmath52 is a cycle in the phase space of @xmath2 , then @xmath53 for all @xmath54 .    for more results in this direction ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "[ ex-1 ] let @xmath55    figures [ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] display the phase spaces of the system @xmath2 and its `` booleanization '' @xmath34 , respectively .",
    ".,width=576 ]    [ fig:2 ]    .,width=172 ]    next we associate to @xmath2 an @xmath56-dimensional linear system over a finite ring .",
    "observe first that @xmath57 is isomorphic , as an abelian group , to @xmath29 via an isomorphism @xmath58 given by the choice of a generator for the cyclic group @xmath59 .",
    "note first that the set of vectors @xmath60 with all non - zero entries is invariant under @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath61 be a generator for the cyclic group @xmath62 , and let @xmath63 then @xmath64 .",
    "define @xmath65 by @xmath66    as defined , @xmath35 is a linear transformation of @xmath67-modules .",
    "but we can consider it as a linear transformation of @xmath29-modules , viewing @xmath29 as a ( finite ) ring , which we denote by @xmath68 .",
    "that is , we have the linear transformation @xmath69    the proof of the following lemma is a straightforward verification .",
    "[ l ] there is a commutative diagram @xmath70    note that the vertical arrows are isomorphisms .",
    "this implies that they preserve the phase space structure , including the length of limit cycles @xcite .",
    "in particular , we have the following corollary .",
    "[ cor-2 ] the phase space of @xmath35 is isomorphic to the subgraph of the phase space of @xmath2 consisting of all states with support vector @xmath71 .",
    "_ example _ [ ex-1 ] ( cont . ) . for the monomial system @xmath2 in example [ ex-1 ] ,",
    "@xmath72 is defined by @xmath73 , where @xmath74 the phase space of @xmath35 is given in figure [ fig:3 ] .",
    ".,width=192 ]    we now come to the main result of this section .",
    "let @xmath75 be a monomial dynamical system .",
    "then @xmath2 is a fixed point system if and only if @xmath34 and @xmath35 are fixed point systems .    from corollaries [ cor-1 ] and [ cor-2 ] , if @xmath2 is a fixed point system , then so are @xmath34 and @xmath35 . for the converse , we assume that @xmath35 and @xmath34 are fixed point systems , but @xmath2 is not . for each limit cycle of @xmath2 , either all states involved have",
    "all coordinates non - zero , or all states involved have at least one zero coordinate . in the first case it follows that @xmath35 has a limit cycle of the same length",
    "hence , if @xmath2 has a limit cycle of length greater than @xmath6 , then it can involve only states with at least one zero coordinate .",
    "let @xmath76 be the states in the limit cycle .",
    "since this limit cycle has to project to a fixed point of @xmath34 it follows that the @xmath77 have the same support vector , i.e. , the same pattern of zero entries , and differ only in the non - zero coordinates .",
    "furthermore , the monomials in the nonzero coordinates do not involve any variables corresponding to zero coordinates .",
    "thus , if we construct new states @xmath78 by replacing each @xmath79 in @xmath77 by a @xmath6 , the @xmath78 will be part of a limit cycle of length at least @xmath80 , which is a contradiction .",
    "this completes the proof of the theorem .",
    "the theorem in the previous section shows that to decide whether a given monomial system @xmath2 , over a finite field @xmath11 , is a fixed point system it is sufficient to decide this question for an associated boolean system , for which a criterion has been developed in @xcite , and a certain linear system over a finite ring @xmath81 .",
    "it therefore remains to develop a criterion for linear systems over finite commutative rings that helps decide whether the system is a fixed point system .",
    "here we reduce the case of a general @xmath81 to that of @xmath82 being a prime power .",
    "let @xmath83 for relatively prime integers @xmath84 and @xmath80 , and let @xmath2 be a linear system over @xmath81 of dimension @xmath56 . choosing an isomorphism @xmath85 we see that @xmath2 is isomorphic to a product @xmath86 where @xmath20 and @xmath87 are linear systems over @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively .",
    "using the fact that the phase space of @xmath2 is then the direct product , as directed graphs , of the phase spaces of @xmath20 and @xmath87 ( see , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite ) , we obtain the following result .",
    "let @xmath90 for relatively prime integers @xmath84 and @xmath80 , and let @xmath2 be a linear system over @xmath81 of dimension @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath20 and @xmath87 be the induced linear transformations over @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively .",
    "then @xmath2 is a fixed point system if and only if @xmath20 and @xmath87 are fixed point systems .    for the purpose of developing a criterion to recognize fixed point systems",
    "it is therefore sufficient to study linear systems over rings of the form @xmath91 for primes @xmath92 .",
    "the following theorem provides a criterion for a further reduction of the problem to a linear system over the prime field @xmath93 .",
    "let @xmath94 be a linear map , and let @xmath20 be the projection map of @xmath2 on @xmath93 .",
    "that is @xmath95 , where @xmath96 .",
    "then the phase space of @xmath20 is isomorphic to a subgraph of the phase space of @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath97 be given by @xmath98 .",
    "then it is easy to check that @xmath99 , since the @xmath24 are linear maps for all @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , it is straightforward to check that @xmath101 if and only if @xmath102 , and hence the phase space of @xmath20 is isomorphic to subgraph of the phase space of @xmath2 .              it remains to study the dynamics of linear systems over finite rings , in particular to find a criterion for a linear system to be a fixed point system .",
    "together with the results in this paper , such a criterion would provide an algorithm for deciding whether a monomial system over an arbitrary finite field is a fixed point system .",
    "however , it appears to be a difficult problem to understand the dynamics of linear systems even over rings of the form @xmath91 , due to the lack of unique factorization in the polynomial ring @xmath106 $ ] .",
