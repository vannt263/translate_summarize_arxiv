    "the surge of activity over the past decade or so in the fields of supernovae and of gamma - ray bursts and their afterglows has led to renewed investigation into the behavior of strong shocks .",
    "much of the analytic work on strong shock propagation to date has focused on self - similar solutions to the hydrodynamic equations . in these solutions ,",
    "the profiles of the hydrodynamic variables as functions of position have constant overall shapes whose time evolution consists simply of scalings in amplitude and position . as a result , self - similarity allows us to reduce the nominal system of two - dimensional partial differential hydrodynamic equations to a system of one - dimensional ordinary differential equations .",
    "the existence of self - similar solutions thus enables a significant simplification of problems free of spatial scales in regions far from the initial conditions .",
    "the best - known such solutions are the pioneering sedov - taylor solutions for non - relativistic point explosions propagating into surroundings with power - law density profiles @xcite .",
    "self - similar solutions are traditionally divided into two categories ( see , for example , @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "` type i ' solutions are those in which the time evolution of the shock position and hydrodynamic variables follows from global conservation laws such as energy conservation .",
    "the sedov - taylor solutions are type i ; their ultrarelativistic analogues were found by @xcite .",
    "by contrast , global conservation laws are useless in ` type ii ' solutions , which are instead characterized by the requirement that the solution remain well - behaved at a singular point known as the ` sonic point ' .",
    "if , for instance , the density of the surroundings falls off very quickly with distance , type ii solutions found by @xcite for non - relativistic spherical explosions hold instead of the sedov - taylor solutions and relativistic solutions found by @xcite hold instead of the blandford - mckee solutions .    here",
    "we study the case of an ultrarelativistic shock wave moving outwards through a star whose envelope has a polytrope - like density profile .",
    "after the shock front reaches the outer edge of the star , an event we refer to as ` breakout ' , the shock front itself ceases to exist but the shocked fluid continues outward into the vacuum originally surrounding the star .",
    "we focus on the flow at times just before and just after breakout . as explained in  2 , the shock evolution just inside the star s surface is identical to that expected for an imploding planar shock in a medium with a power - law density profile .",
    "such a shock follows a type ii self - similar solution as discussed by @xcite and @xcite and outlined briefly here . ",
    "3 describes the asymptotic solution as the shock front reaches the surface of the star , a singular point . in  4 we investigate the flow after breakout .",
    "we show that the self - similar solution for the evolution inside the star also describes the behavior outside the star except in that a different range of the similarity variable applies and in that the physical interpretation of the characteristic position changes .",
    "we show in  5 that the analytic results of  2 , 3 , 4 agree with our numerical integrations of the relativistic time - dependent hydrodynamic equations , and in  6 we summarize our findings . throughout our discussion , we take the speed of light to be @xmath0 .",
    "since we are interested in the shock after it has reached the envelope or the outermost layers of a star , we assume that the mass and distance lying between the shock front and the star s outer edge are much less than the mass and distance between the shock front and the star s center . in this region , we can take the star s gravity @xmath1 to be constant and the geometry to be planar .",
    "we also assume that the stellar envelope has a polytrope - like equation of state , that is , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the pressure , @xmath4 is the mass density , and @xmath5 is a constant .",
    "this type of equation of state occurs in various contexts including fully convective stellar envelopes , in which case @xmath5 is the adiabatic index ; radiative envelopes where the opacity has a power - law dependence on the density and temperature ; and degenerate envelopes .    under these assumptions",
    "we can find the density profile from hydrostatic equilibrium and the equation of state as follows .",
    "let @xmath6 be the radial coordinate such that @xmath7 at the star s surface and @xmath8 inside the star .",
    "then @xmath9 and with the boundary condition @xmath10 at the edge of the star , we have @xmath11 @xmath12 for convective and degenerate envelopes , @xmath5 is between @xmath13 and @xmath14 ; for radiative envelopes with kramers opacity , @xmath15 . these give @xmath16 values between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    with the power - law density profile @xmath19 , the evolution of an ultrarelativistic shock propagating through the envelope",

    "we assume the effect of the star s gravity on the shock propagation is negligible .",
    "following @xcite , we let @xmath24 be the solution s characteristic position , which we choose to be the position of the shock front while the shock is within the star .",
    "we take @xmath25 at the time the shock reaches the star s surface ( @xmath26 ) , and we take @xmath27 when @xmath28 .",
    "we take @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 to be respectively the characteristic lorentz factor , pressure , and number density , and we define @xmath32 following @xcite , we define the similarity variable as @xmath33 note that for @xmath27 , @xmath34 and the relevant range in @xmath35 is @xmath36 as long as @xmath37 .",
    "we define the hydrodynamic variables  the lorentz factor @xmath38 , the pressure @xmath3 , and the number density @xmath39as follows : @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 here @xmath1 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 give the profiles of @xmath38 , @xmath3 , and @xmath39 ; expressions for the dependence of @xmath45 on @xmath16 and for @xmath1 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 as functions of @xmath35 make up the entire self - similar solution .",
    "the above definitions and the ultrarelativistic hydrodynamic equations in planar geometry put the sonic point , the point separating fluid elements which can communicate with the shock front via sound waves from those which can not , at @xmath46 . requiring that the solution pass smoothly through this point gives @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 the boundary conditions @xmath51 which hold inside the star allow us to determine the constants of integration @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and write @xmath55 ^{-\\left(3 - 2\\sqrt{3}\\right)k}\\ ] ] @xmath56^{-(4 - 2\\sqrt{3})k}\\ ] ] @xmath57^{-\\frac{\\left ( 2\\sqrt{3}-3\\right)(2k-1)k }                     { -1+k\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{3 } } }      \\left [ 2-g\\chi \\right]^{\\frac{k}{-1+k\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{3 } } } \\;\\;\\ ; .\\ ] ]",
    "to know what happens to the shocked material after the shock front emerges from the star , we need the behavior of the shock just as the front reaches the surface  the ` initial conditions ' for the evolution of the shock after breakout . specifically , we are interested in the limiting behavior of each fluid element and in the asymptotic profiles of @xmath38 , @xmath3 , and @xmath39 as functions of @xmath6 as @xmath58 and @xmath59 approach 0 .",
    "the limiting behavior of a given fluid element may be found as follows .",
    "due to the self - similarity , we know the time taken for @xmath38 , @xmath3 , and @xmath39 of a given fluid element to change significantly is the timescale on which @xmath59 changes by an amount of order itself . since @xmath59 can change by this much only once between the time a given fluid element is shocked and the time the shock breaks out of the star , the limiting values of @xmath38 , @xmath3 , and @xmath39 for that fluid element should be larger only by a factor of order unity from their values when the fluid element was first shocked .    we can also find the scalings of @xmath38 , @xmath3 , and @xmath39 with @xmath6 at breakout via simple physical arguments .",
    "we denote by @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 the position , lorentz factor , pressure , and number density of a fluid element just after being shocked and by @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 those values at the time the shock breaks out .",
    "since the shock accelerates to infinite lorentz factors , and since , as we found above , the lorentz factor of a given fluid element remains constant up to a numerical factor , this fluid element will lag behind the shock by @xmath68 at @xmath25 .",
    "[ char_powerlaws ] gives @xmath69 , so we have @xmath70 ; then @xmath71 or @xmath72 likewise , since @xmath73 and @xmath74 , we have @xmath75 and @xmath76 ; then @xmath77 @xmath78    we can use the equations for the solution before breakout to perform equivalent calculations of the limiting behavior of fluid elements and asymptotic profiles of @xmath38 , @xmath3 , @xmath39 . for the limiting behavior of a fluid element , we take the advective time derivative of @xmath79 and use the result to relate @xmath38 and @xmath1 to time for that fluid element .",

    "since the breakout itself does not introduce new spatial scales into the flow , we expect the motion after breakout to remain self - similar . however ,",
    "as the shock lorentz factor diverges at @xmath25 , we can not continue to associate the characteristic position , lorentz factor , pressure , and number density with the values at the shock front after breakout .",
    "so we begin by providing physical motivation for a different characteristic lorentz factor and exploring the implications of this choice .",
    "we note that after breakout each fluid element expands and accelerates over time until the element s internal energy has been converted entirely into bulk motion .",
    "given a relativistic strong shock , the internal energy of a shocked fluid element in the frame moving with the fluid is comparable to the bulk kinetic energy of the fluid element .",
    "this implies that the fluid element s final bulk lorentz factor should be much greater than the value of the shock lorentz factor just after the fluid element was shocked .",
    "the timescale @xmath104 for the resulting expansion and acceleration is the time over which the fluid element s size and lorentz factor change by a factor of order unity . for a fluid element located at @xmath105 and with lorentz factor @xmath106 at @xmath25 , the time of breakout , this timescale is @xmath107 due to relativistic beaming .",
    "that every time @xmath108 is thus associated in a scale - independent way with a particular @xmath104 and @xmath38 suggests that we pick @xmath109 to be the characteristic lorentz factor .    to see how @xmath95 evolves with time , we use @xmath110 from eq .  [ gamma_inside_limit ] with the @xmath104 relation above to get @xmath111 .",
    "for the characteristic pressure @xmath96 and number density @xmath97 , eqs .",
    "[ p_inside_limit ] , [ n_inside_limit ] likewise give @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "in other words , eq .  [ char_powerlaws ] holds after breakout with exactly the same @xmath16 , @xmath45 that apply inside the star .",
    "the characteristic position @xmath59 is again the position which evolves according to the lorentz factor @xmath95 : @xmath114 .",
    "since the hydrodynamic equations still hold as well , eqs .",
    "[ chi ] , [ g_general ] , [ f_general ] , [ h_general ] must remain valid when @xmath108 .    to find the complete solution after breakout we need to specify the boundary conditions .",
    "we proceed by looking at the behavior of the similarity variables @xmath35 , @xmath1 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "the relevant range in @xmath35 depends on @xmath59 , and while the relation between @xmath59 and @xmath95 is the same before and after breakout , @xmath59 after breakout is not the position of the shock front .",
    "instead , the front has infinite lorentz factor and @xmath59 lags further and further behind the shock with increasing time .",
    "a nice physical interpretation exists for @xmath59 after breakout .",
    "@xmath59 tracks the position corresponding to a fluid element which has expanded by a factor of order unity , so @xmath59 marks the transition in position between fluid elements which have expanded and accelerated significantly since being shocked and fluid elements whose size and speed have remained roughly constant . since it takes longer for fluid elements with smaller lorentz factors to expand and accelerate significantly , @xmath59 moves backward relative to the leading edge of the flow at @xmath115 . because @xmath59 becomes positive after breakout , the range of possible @xmath6 in the solution outside the star is @xmath116 .",
    "then @xmath117 at the ` front ' @xmath115 , and the relevant range in @xmath35 in the solution outside is @xmath118 rather than @xmath36 .    far behind @xmath115 , the profiles of @xmath38 , @xmath3 , and @xmath39 before breakout must coincide with the profiles after breakout .",
    "we know this because at a given time after breakout , sound waves carrying the information that breakout occurred can only have traveled a finite distance behind the shock front ; material further behind continues to flow as if the breakout had never occurred .",
    "also , the two sets of profiles must coincide at @xmath25 , when everything is far behind the front . to phrase this requirement on the profiles in terms of the similarity variable , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121",
    "before breakout must coincide with @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 after breakout .",
    "then as @xmath125 after breakout , @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "in addition , the constants @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 in eqs .",
    "[ g_general ] , [ f_general ] , [ h_general ] must be the same for both the pre- and post - breakout solutions .",
    "in other words , the solutions before and after breakout , as specified by eqs .",
    "[ chi ] , [ g_general ] , [ f_general ] , [ h_general ] and expressions for @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , are the same ; only the relevant ranges in @xmath35 and the physical interpretations of the variables differ .",
    "so the expressions for @xmath1 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 after breakout are @xmath128 ^{-\\left(3 - 2\\sqrt{3}\\right)k}\\ ] ] @xmath129^{-(4 - 2\\sqrt{3})k}\\ ] ] @xmath130^{-\\frac{\\left ( 2\\sqrt{3}-3\\right)(2k-1)k }                     { -1+k\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{3 } } }      \\left [ g\\chi-2 \\right]^{\\frac{k}{-1+k\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{3 } } } \\;\\;\\ ; .\\ ] ] the boundary conditions after breakout are given explicitly by @xmath131 and @xmath132 at @xmath133 .",
    "a graphical comparison between the pre- and post - breakout @xmath38 vs. position profiles is given in figure  [ gprofilevst ] along with sample trajectories of fluid elements .",
    "while the flow before breakout follows a type ii self - similar solution , the solution describing the flow after breakout contains elements of type i and type ii solutions . unlike the type ii solution which applies before breakout",
    ", the post - breakout solution does not contain a sonic point .",
    "differentiating eq .",
    "[ g_outside ] with respect to @xmath79 shows that the only local extremum of @xmath79 occurs at @xmath134 or @xmath117 , where @xmath135 ; since @xmath127 as @xmath136 , @xmath79 must attain its global minimum at @xmath117 .",
    "but then for @xmath137 neither the sonic point , @xmath46 , nor the other singular points , @xmath138 and @xmath139 , is included in the solution after breakout .",
    "a more physical argument for the exclusion of the sonic point from the post - breakout solution is that since each fluid element is accelerating while @xmath95 decreases with time , the fluid element moves forward relative to @xmath59 and its @xmath35 must decrease with time . using eq .",
    "[ ddt_advective ] we see that @xmath140 requires @xmath141 for every fluid element .",
    "then the entire post - breakout solution is causally connected as would be expected if it were type i.    unlike type i solutions , however , the solution after breakout contains infinite energy : it can be thought of as representing a flow into which a source at @xmath142 feeds energy at a constant rate , sustaining the acceleration of fluid elements further and further behind the shock . as a result , global conservation laws do not apply just as would be expected in a type ii solution .",
    "so the post - breakout solution lies between the standard type i and type ii solution categories .",
    "while this unusual situation implies that , in principle , the infinite energy contained in the solution can communicate with and affect the region near @xmath59 , the regions of the solution containing this infinite energy lie arbitrarily far behind the front at @xmath115 and therefore take arbitrarily long to communicate with the fluid near the front .",
    "similarly , in any application of the post - breakout solution , the flow will be truncated at some position well behind @xmath59 , potentially introducing a spatial scale into the problem .",
    "however , the solution is valid until information from the truncation region propagates to areas close to @xmath59 .",
    "the further the truncation from @xmath59 , the longer this will take .",
    "the first analytic investigation of an ultrarelativistic planar shock wave was performed by @xcite .",
    "the problem they consider is broadly similar to the one we discuss here , but our work differs in important respects from theirs .",
    "first , @xcite used the method of characteristics in their work : they analyzed the flow associated with the shock by tracing the paths of sound waves travelling through the fluid .",
    "our analysis uses the self - similarity of the flow instead .",
    "so while some of their work can be applied to flows moving through fluids with arbitrary decreasing density profiles , their methods do not give profiles for the hydrodynamic variables as functions of @xmath6 at a given time .",
    "by contrast , our self - similar solutions require a power - law density profile inside the star but give explicit profiles for the hydrodynamic variables .",
    "second , the methods used by @xcite require initial conditions consisting of a uniform stationary hot fluid about to expand into cold surroundings . in our scenario",
    "the hot expanding fluid is never uniform or stationary and always follows the self - similar profile specified by our solution .",
    "the self - similarity analysis tells us that the solution is type ii , at least before breakout ; this implies that the asymptotic solution is independent of the initial engine .",
    "we can check that our asymptotic solution is consistent with the findings of @xcite by looking at the lorentz factors of individual fluid elements at very late times .",
    "while in our self - similar solution the fluid elements formally accelerate forever , each fluid element must in practice stop accelerating when all of its internal energy has been converted to bulk kinetic energy , or when @xmath143 .",
    "so we can estimate the final lorentz factor of a given fluid element from eqs .",
    "[ g_outside ] , [ f_outside ] , [ h_outside ] . by taking the advective time derivatives of @xmath38 and of @xmath144 we can write differential equations for their time evolution following a single fluid element .",
    "these are @xmath145      \\frac{k}{-1+k\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{3 } } \\\\ & \\simeq & \\frac{(f / h)}{t } \\left(\\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right ) \\;\\;\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the last steps we have taken the limit of late times when the accelerating fluid element approaches the shock front at @xmath117 . in this limit eq .",
    "[ g_outside ] implies @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "let @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 be the values of the functions in question just after our fluid element is shocked ; then at late times @xmath151 so @xmath152 . integrating the above differential equations then gives @xmath153 this agrees with the results of @xcite for the final lorentz factor of the fluid in a strong ultrarelativistic shock propagating into a cold medium with decreasing density .",
    "the agreement provides additional support for our claim that the solution outside the star behaves like the solution describing a standard planar shock up to the initial conditions and the interpretation of the characteristic values @xmath59 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "note that the differences between the initial conditions used in their work and in ours are unimportant to the scaling law relating the final and initial lorentz factors of a given fluid element .",
    "this result agrees with the findings of @xcite concerning the scaling law : partly because of uncertainty over the different initial conditions , they used numerical simulations to check the @xmath154 result .",
    "recently , @xcite also investigated the problem of an ultrarelativistic planar shock .",
    "while the self - similar solution they give for the flow before breakout is identical to the one in @xcite and outlined here , they do not give analytic results for or a physical interpretation of the self - similar solution after breakout .",
    "to verify our results numerically , we integrated the time - dependent relativistic hydrodynamic equations using a one - dimensional code . figure  [ gprofile_in ] shows curves for @xmath38 as a function of position at a single time before breakout , while figure  [ gpnvstime_in ] shows the time evolution of @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 before breakout .",
    "the numerical and analytic results are in excellent agreement .",
    "figures  [ gprofile_out ] and [ gpnvstime_out ] respectively show the @xmath38 vs. @xmath6 profile and time evolution of @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 after breakout ; the agreement between numerical and analytic results here confirms the choice of scale @xmath24 after breakout that we discussed in   4.1 .",
    "we have shown that , given an ultrarelativistic shock propagating into a planar polytropic envelope , the flow upon the shock s emergence from the envelope into vacuum follows a self - similar solution strikingly similar to the self - similar solution describing the flow while the shock remains within the envelope .",
    "both self - similar solutions obey the same relations with regard to the time - evolution of the characteristic quantities @xmath59 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and with regard to the similarity variables @xmath35 , @xmath1 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "the pre- and post - breakout solutions differ only in that the applicable ranges in @xmath35 and the physical interpretations of the characteristic quantities differ . as a result of these differences , the behavior of the flow after breakout lies somewhere between the traditional type i and type ii classes of self - similar solutions ; before breakout a type ii solution applies .",
    "to arrive at these results we have looked in detail at the behavior when the shock reaches the outer edge of the envelope .",
    "we have discussed these results in the context of an application  the motion of a shock wave through a polytropic envelope near the surface of a star , the shock s emergence from the surface , and the subsequent flow into vacuum .",
