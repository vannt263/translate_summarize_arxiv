    "power system operations aim to optimally utilize available electricity generation resources to satisfy projected demand , at minimal cost , subject to various physical transmission and operational security constraints .",
    "traditionally , such operations involve numerous sub - tasks , including short - term load forecasting , unit commitment , economic dispatch , voltage and frequency control , and interchange scheduling between distinct operators .",
    "most recently , renewable generation units in the form of geographically distributed wind and solar farms have imposed the additional requirement to consider uncertain generation output , increasingly in conjunction with the deployment of advanced storage technologies such as pumped hydro . growth in system size and the introduction of significant generation output uncertainty",
    "contribute to increased concerns regarding system vulnerability .",
    "large - scale blackouts , such as the northeast blackout of 2003 in north america and , more recently , the blackout of july 2012 in india , impact millions of people and result in significant economic costs .",
    "similarly , failure to accurately account for renewables output uncertainty can lead to large - scale forced outages , as in the case of ercot on february 26 , 2008 .",
    "such events have led to an increased focus on power systems reliability , with the goal of mitigating against failures due to both natural causes and intelligent adversaries .",
    "optimization methods have been applied to power system operational problems for several decades ; wood and wollenberg @xcite provide a brief overview .",
    "the coupling of state - of - the - art implementations of core optimization algorithms ( including simplex , barrier , and mixed - integer branch - and - cut algorithms ) and current computing capabilities ( e.g. , inexpensive multi - core processors ) enable optimal decision - making in real power systems .",
    "one notable example involves the unit commitment problem , which is used to determine the day - ahead schedule for all generators in a given operating region of an electricity grid .",
    "a solution to the unit commitment problem specifies , for each hour in the scheduling horizon ( typically 24 hours ) , both the set of generators that are to be operating and their corresponding projected power output levels . the solution must satisfy a large number of generator ( e.g. , ramp rates , minimum up and down times , and capacity limits ) and transmission ( e.g. , power flow and thermal limit ) constraints , achieving a minimal total production cost while satisfying forecasted demand .",
    "the unit commitment problem has been widely studied , for over three decades . for a review of the relevant literature",
    ", we refer to @xcite and the more recent @xcite .",
    "many heuristic ( e.g. , genetic algorithms , tabu search , and simulated annealing ) and mathematical optimization ( e.g. , integer programming , dynamic programming , and lagrangian relaxation ) methods have been introduced to solve the unit commitment problem . until the early 2000s ,",
    "lagrangian relaxation methods were the dominant approach used in practice .",
    "however , mixed - integer programming implementations are either currently in use or will soon be adopted by all independent system operators ( isos ) in the united states to solve the unit commitment problem @xcite .",
    "security constraints ( i.e. , which ensure system performance is sustained when certain components fail ) in the context of unit commitment are now a required regulatory element of power systems operations .",
    "the north american electric reliability corporation ( nerc ) develops and enforces standards to ensure power systems reliability in north america .",
    "of strongest relevance to security constraints for unit commitment is the nerc transmission planning standard ( tpl-001 - 0.1 , tpl-002 - 0b , tpl-003 - 0b , tpl-004 - 0a , @xcite ) .",
    "the tpl specifies 4 categories of operating states , labeled a through d. category a represents the baseline",
    " normal \" state , during which there are no system component failures .",
    "category b represents so called @xmath0-@xmath4 contingency states , in which a single system component has failed ( out of a total of @xmath0 components , including generators and transmission lines ) .",
    "nerc requires no loss - of - load in both categories a and b , which collectively represent the vast majority of observed operational states .",
    "categories c and d of the tpl represent more extreme states , in which multiple system components fail ( near ) simultaneously .",
    "large - scale blackouts , typically caused by cascading failures , are category d events . such failure states are known as @xmath0-@xmath1 contingencies in the power system literature , where @xmath1 ( @xmath5 ) denotes the number of component failures . in contrast to categories a and b , the regulatory requirements for categories c and d are vaguely specified , e.g. ,  some \" loss of load is allowable , and it is permissible to exceed normal transmission line capacities by unspecified amounts for brief time periods .",
    "the computational difficulty of security - constrained unit commitment is well - known , and is further a function of the specific tpl category that is being considered .",
    "the unit commitment problem subject to @xmath0-@xmath4 reliability constraints is , given the specific regulatory requirements imposed for category b events of the tpl , addressed by system operators worldwide .",
    "however , we observe that it is often solved approximately in practice , specifically in the context of large - scale ( iso - scale ) systems @xcite .",
    "for example , a subset of contingencies based on a careful engineering analysis is often used to obtain a computationally tractable unit commitment problem .",
    "alternatively , the unit commitment problem can be solved without considering contingencies , and the solution can be subsequently  screened \" for validity under a subset of contingencies ( again identified by engineering analysis ) .",
    "additional constraints can then be added to the master unit commitment problem , which is then resolved ; the process repeats until there is no loss - of - load in the contingency states .",
    "we raise this issue primarily to point out that even the full @xmath0-@xmath4 problem is not considered a  solved \" problem in practice , such that advances ( including those introduced in this paper ) in the solution of unit commitment problems subject to general @xmath0-@xmath1 reliability constraints can potentially impact the practical solution of the simpler @xmath0-@xmath4 variant .",
    "numerous researchers have introduced algorithms for solving both the security - constrained unit commitment problem and the simpler , related problem of security - constrained optimal power flow . in the latter ,",
    "the analysis is restricted to a single time period , and binary variables relating to generation unit statuses are fixed based on a pre - computed unit commitment schedule .",
    "@xcite provides a recent review of the literature on security - constrained optimal power flow .",
    "of specific relevance to our work is the literature on security - constrained optimal power flow in situations where large numbers of system components fail .",
    "this literature is mostly based on worst - case network interdiction analysis and includes solution methods based on bi - level and mixed - integer programming ( see @xcite ) and graph algorithms ( see @xcite ) .    following the northeast us blackout of 2003 , significant attention",
    "was focused on developing improved solution methods for the security - constrained unit commitment problem . in particular , various researchers introduced mixed - integer programming and decomposition - based methods for more efficiently enforcing @xmath0-@xmath4 reliability , e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "however , due to its computational complexity , security - constrained unit commitment considering the full spectrum of nerc reliability standards has not attracted a comparable level of attention until very recently .",
    "specifically , @xcite and @xcite consider the case of security - constrained unit commitment under the more general @xmath0-@xmath1 reliability criterion .",
    "similarly , @xcite and @xcite use robust optimization methods for identifying worst - case @xmath0-@xmath1 contingencies .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the @xmath0-@xmath1 reliability criterion to yield the more general @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 criterion .",
    "this new criterion dictates that for all contingencies of size @xmath6 , @xmath7 , at least @xmath3 fraction of the total demand must be met , with @xmath8 $ ] and @xmath9 .",
    "the primary motivation for introducing this metric is that it provides a practical and quantifiable bound on system performance under categories c and d tpl contingencies , and can easily be expressed in mathematical optimization models .",
    "we refer to the security - constrained unit commitment problem subject to @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 reliability as the contingency - constrained unit commitment ( ccuc ) problem . in the ccuc ,",
    "all contingencies with @xmath1 or fewer element failures ( generation units or transmission lines ) are implicitly considered when checking for the feasibility of post - contingency corrective recourse .",
    "the ccuc is formulated as a large - scale mixed - integer linear program ( milp ) . to solve the ccuc",
    ", we develop two decomposition strategies : one based on a benders decomposition @xcite , and another based on cutting planes derived from the solution of power system inhibition problems @xcite .",
    "we then show the computational effectiveness of our algorithms on a range of benchmark instances .",
    "our specific contributions , as detailed in this paper , include :    * we ensure the existence of a feasible post - contingency corrective recourse , taking into consideration generator ramping constraints and the no - contingency ( nominal ) state economic dispatch ; * we consider the loss of both generation units _ and _ transmission lines ; * we propose novel decomposition methods to solve the contingency - constrained ccuc efficiently , and show that models and methods proposed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite are all special cases of our general approach .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",

    "consequently , we require that the demand at each bus @xmath36 must be fully satisfied , i.e. , no loss - of - load is allowed .",
    "our buc formulation for a power system @xmath32 is given as follows :    [ suc ] @xmath68    the optimization objective is to minimize the sum of the startup costs @xmath69 , shutdown costs @xmath70 , and generation cost @xmath71 .",

    "for clarity of exposition and conciseness , we define the set @xmath72 given by @xmath73 .",
    "the minimum generation cost @xmath71 , given a unit commitment @xmath57 is constrained by a combination of dc power flow constraints and unit ramping constraints , as follows :    [ suc - sp ] @xmath74    the optimization objective is to minimize generation cost given a unit commitment @xmath57 , where @xmath75 is a linear approximation of generation cost for thermal units , as is commonly employed .",
    "we discuss this linearization further below .",
    "constraints - constitute an optimal power flow formulation , and include ( in order ) : power balance at each bus ; power flow on a line , proportional to the difference in voltage phase angles at the terminal buses ; transmission line capacity limits ; lower and upper bounds for committed generation unit output levels ; and generation ramp - up / ramp - down constraints for pairs of consecutive time periods and .    by linearizing the generation cost functions ,",
    "- provides a mixed - integer linear programming ( milp ) formulation of the unit commitment problem with transmission constraints , but without contingency constraints .",
    "a solution to the buc provides an on / off schedule for all generation units , over all time periods in the horizon @xmath76 . in practice , committed generation units are adjusted on an hourly or sub - hourly basis , by ramping up or down specific units in order to satisfy realized demand .",
    "further , additional fast - reaction ( i.e. ,  peaker \" ) units can be brought online if necessary . however , this process occurs on a different time scale than the buc , i.e. , one or two hours prior to real - time execution .      according to the nerc tpl standard , in the event of a loss involving a single component ( i.e. , an @xmath0-@xmath4 contingency ) , a power system must remain stable and satisfy all demand . in the case of two or more simultaneous losses ( i.e. , an @xmath0-@xmath1 contingency with @xmath77 ) ,",

    "similarly , constraints enforce generation ramp - down constraints . if a generation unit is involved in a contingency , then @xmath115 and the ramp - down constraint is non - binding .",
    "otherwise , a generator can only ramp - down by @xmath116 from its pre - contingency level .",
    "constraints ensure that loss - of - load at each bus does not exceed the demand at that bus .",
    "finally , constraints ensure that at most @xmath117 fraction of the aggregate demand can be shed in a size @xmath82 contingency .",
    "observe that in ( [ cont_const ] ) , lower limits on power output for generation units not in the contingency are relaxed to ensure sufficient operational flexibility .",
    "these lower limits can be easily incorporated for systems with sufficiently flexible generation units .",
    "in addition , we implicitly assume that the on / off state of generation units _ not _ involved in a contingency are fixed and can not be changed via recourse variables during the contingency . for those generation units that are not involved in the contingency ,",
    "the power output levels @xmath118 are not allowed to deviate from the baseline ( pre - contingency ) power output levels @xmath63 beyond the interval @xmath119 $ ] , given physical ramping limitations .",
    "we now examine the impact of contingency constraints on optimal buc solutions using the 6-bus test system introduced in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "our goals are to concretely illustrate ( a ) the often significant changes in solution structure induced by the requirements to maintain @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 in unit commitment , relative to the baseline and @xmath0-@xmath4 cases , and ( b ) the redundant nature of contingency constraints , in that satisfaction of one contingency state yields solutions that can  cover \" many other contingency states .",

    "data for the original generator set and the three additional generators is summarized in table [ tab10 ] .",
    "transmission line data is summarized in table [ tab11 ] .",
    "[ tab10 ]    consistent with @xcite-@xcite , the unit shutdown cost is negligible and assumed to be zero in our analysis . for illustrative purposes ,",
    "we only consider the buc with a single time period , with loads of 51.2 , 102.4 , and 42.8 at buses 3 , 4 , and 5 , respectively .",

    "5 generation units must be committed , as shown in figure  [ figure3](a ) .",
    "of these , two units ( g1 and g3 ) provide generation capacity during the no - contingency state , while three units ( g4 , g5 , and g6 ) function as spinning reserves . unlike the practical approach of explicitly setting aside spinning reserves ( e.g. , equivalent to the capacity of the largest unit ) via constraints , our proposed ccuc model implicitly and automatically selects units to provide spinning reserves , within the context of satisfying contingency constraints .",
    "further , in contrast to the approach of explicitly allocating spinning reserves , our proposed ccuc model guarantees that there is adequate transmission capability to dispatch the generator outputs during all contingency states .",
    "the optimal @xmath0-@xmath4-compliant buc solution shown in figure [ figure3](a ) represents the system in steady state operations , i.e. , under no observed contingency .",

    "we observe that it is sufficient to consider _ only _ the two contingency states shown in figure [ figure3](b ) and figure [ figure3](c ) in order to achieve full @xmath0-@xmath4 compliance .",
    "in other words , accounting for those two contingencies _ implicitly _ yields feasible corrective recourse actions for the other @xmath0-@xmath4 contingency states . as we discuss in section  [ sec : solution ] , in most practical systems only a small number of contingency states are likely to impact the optimal unit commitment solution .",
    "consequently , we design our algorithm to screen for these critical contingencies implicitly , without the need to explicitly consider all possible combinations of system component failures  thus avoiding the combinatorial explosion in the number of possible contingencies .    if the maximum allowable contingency size is increased to @xmath120 , the optimal buc solution for the 6-bus test system commits four generation units , as shown in figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "in addition to including @xmath120 contingencies in our analysis , we require that loads must be fully served in the no - contingency state and that a post - contingency corrective resource exist for all @xmath121 contingencies with zero loss - of - load , per tpl standards . for all @xmath120 contingencies ,",
    "the allowable loss - of - load threshold is set to @xmath122 , to ensure that there is sufficient slack to accommodate the loss of both transmission lines connected to bus 5 .",
    "if both transmission lines connected to bus 5 fail , then the load at that bus can not be served ; the factor @xmath123 corresponds to the minimal loss - of - load under this contingency . for systems with greater redundancy and flexibility , such as those presented section [ sec : experiments ]",
    ", the loss - of - load threshold can be set more conservatively ( i.e. , lower ) .",
    "of the four committed units , one unit ( g1 ) is producing at maximum capacity and three units ( 4 , 5 , and 6 ) are producing at at levels below their maximum rating .",
    "taken together , these three units can provide up to 150mw of spinning reserves .",
    "although fewer units are committed ( 4 compared to 5 ) relative to the @xmath0-@xmath4 solution , the two least expensive units ( g1 and g2 ) are not committed while the three most expensive units ( g4 , g5 , and g6 ) are committed in the @xmath0-@xmath124-@xmath2 compliant solution .     -5.2 cm    we conclude with the obvious , yet critical , observation that contingency constraints must be considered in normal ( no - contingency ) unit commitment operations in order to ensure that a feasible post - contingency corrective recourse exists for all contingency states under consideration .",
    "given the baseline unit commitment model ( buc ) and associated contingency constraints as defined respectively in sections  [ sec : model - standarduc ] and [ sec : model - contingencies ] , we can now describe our full contingency - constrained unit commitment ( ccuc ) problem :    @xmath125    the resulting unit commitment decision vector @xmath57 represents a minimal - cost solution that satisfies ( 1 ) the non - contingency demands @xmath126 for each bus @xmath19 for each time period @xmath106 , ( 2 ) the generation unit ramping constraints and startup / shutdown constraints , and ( 3 ) the network security and dc power flow constraints for each contingency , subject to loss - of - load allowances @xmath127 .",

    "as expected , the extensive form approach ( ef ) can only solve the smallest instances , since for each contingency , a full set of dc power flow constraints ( [ cont_const ] ) must be explicitly embedded in the formulation . as the number of contingencies grows , this formulation quickly becomes intractable .",
    "the exit status  lpr \" and `` om '' represent `` solving linear programming relaxation at root node '' and `` out of memory '' , respectively .",
    "note that our test instances only represent small to at most moderate sized systems relative to real power systems ( which can contain on the order of thousands to tens of thousands of elements ) , indicating that even significant advances in solver technology are unlikely to mitigate this issue .",
    "further , even given significant algorithmic advances , the memory requirements associated with the ef will likely cause the intractability to persist .",
    "the bd approach attempts to address the exponential , as shown in remark 6 , explosion in the number of contingencies via a benders reformulation / decomposition , with corresponding delayed cut generation .",
    "however , although the bd approach does not explicitly incorporate power flow constraints ( [ cont_const ] ) for each contingency into the formulation , those power flow constraints must still be solved to identify violated feasibility cuts ( which are then added to the master problem ) . in summary ,",
    "the bd approach mitigates the memory issues associated with the ef approach , but the cost of identifying feasibility violations for a rapidly growing number of contingencies remains prohibitive .",
    "overall , the bd approach can solve larger instances than the ef approach , but still fails given larger @xmath1 and larger test instances .",
    "finally , we consider the performance of our third approach : csa2 . here , we see that all of our test instances , with the sole exception of the wecc-240 system with @xmath211 , can be solved within the 3 hour time limit .",
    "this result is enabled by the combination of using a dynamic contingency list ( significantly reducing the number of psip solves ) and the fact that we are able to implicitly evaluate all the contingencies in order to identify a violated contingency , and then quickly find a corresponding feasibility cut by solving a single linear program ( dcf ) .",
    "these features of the csa2 algorithm allow it to mitigate the effects of a combinatorial number of contingencies and the associated impact on run - times and memory requirements .",
    "lastly , we note that although cpa2 failed to solve the wecc-240 system with @xmath211 within the allocate time , the final solution at the three hour mark is in fact a @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 compliant solution . for large power systems and/or contingency budgets , significant computational time is required to `` prove '' feasibility .",
    "eliminating the three hour time limit , we observed that the wecc-240 system with @xmath211 could be solved in approximately 18 hours , with the majority of this time taken to prove feasibility of the final solution .",
    "we next examine the run - times of our csa2 algorithm in further detail , as reported in table [ tab2 ] . for each instance",
    ", we report the total number of possible contingency states @xmath209 and the number of contingencies for which corresponding feasibility cuts were actually generated .",
    "the latter corresponds to the final size of the dynamic contingency list , which is reported in the column labeled  @xmath212 \" .",
    "clearly , @xmath212 corresponds to a vanishingly small fraction of the possible number of contingencies , which is critical to the tractability of the approach .",
    "the remaining columns of table [ tab2 ] break down the total run time ( in wall clock seconds ) by the three main components of the algorithm  the rmp , which identifies unit commitments ; the power system inhibition problem ( psip ) , which identifies a contingency that has no feasible corrective recourse power flow given the current rmp uc decisions and no - contingency economic dispatch ; and the contingency feasibility subproblems ( dcf ) , which yield the feasibility cuts .",
    "the final column , labeled `` cuts '' , reports the total number of feasibility cuts generated in solving the instance .",
    "it is clear from table [ tab2 ] that the computational bottleneck in the csa2 algorithm is the solution of the psip , such that any improvements to that process will yield immediate reductions in csa2 run - times .",
    "we have investigated the problem of committing generation units in power system operations , and determining a corresponding no - contingency state economic dispatch , such that the resulting solution satisfies the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 reliability criterion .",
    "this reliability criterion is a generalization of the well - known @xmath0-@xmath1 criterion , and requires that at least @xmath3 fraction of the total demand is met following the failure of @xmath6 system components , for @xmath80 .",
    "we refer to this problem as the contingency - constrained unit commitment problem , or ccuc .",
    "we proposed two algorithms to solve the ccuc : one based on the benders decomposition approach , and another based on contingency screening algorithms .",
    "the latter method avoids the combinatorial explosion in the number of contingencies by seeking vulnerabilities in the current solution , and generating valid inequalities to exclude such infeasible solutions in the master problem .",
    "we tested our proposed algorithms on test systems of varying sizes .",
    "computational results show our proposed contingency screening algorithm ( csa2 ) , which uses a bi - level separation program to implicitly consider all contingencies and a dynamic contingency list to avoid re - identification of contingencies , significantly outperforms the benders decomposition approach .",
    "we were able to solve all test systems , with the exception of the largest wecc-240 instance , in under 3 hours .",
    "in contrast , both the benders decomposition algorithm and a straightforward solution of the ccuc extensive form , failed to solve all but the smallest instances within 3 hours .",
    "we believe that this paper will provide a significant basis for subsequent research in contingency - constrained unit commitment .",
    "for example , we are working to apply these methods to full - scale systems .",
    "while our results are promising in terms of scalability , full - scale problems pose more significant computational challenges , and consequently will require stronger formulations for the power system inhibition problem and possible adoption of high - performance computing resources .",
    "further , our current ccuc model assumes all component failures occur simultaneously . in order to reflect practical operational situations , where failures may happen consecutively , new ccuc models that consider timing between system component failures are needed .",
    "we plan to extend our ccuc models to include these cases .",
    "finally , we worked exclusively with a deterministic ccuc model to date .",
    "however , it is ultimately essential to take uncertainty into account in unit commitment , e.g. , to account for uncertain demand and renewable generation units .",
