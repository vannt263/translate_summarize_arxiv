    "to understand the global properties of flows induced by vector fields on manifolds , it seems natural to study the _ quotient space _ ( _ orbit space _ ) of a flow , the topological space whose points are the trajectories of the flow .",
    "this invariant has perhaps been neglected , since such spaces frequently fail to be hausdorff or even @xmath2 .",
    "however , one can still proceed in several directions . even without the @xmath2 condition",
    ", one can still apply algebraic topology : calcut , mccarthy and the author @xcite showed that the quotient map induces a surjection of fundamental groups ( provided that the quotient is semilocally simply connected ) .",
    "for gradient - like vector fields , calcut and the author @xcite showed that the quotient map is a weak homotopy equivalence onto a locally contractible space . in the present paper",
    "we take a complementary approach , focusing on flows whose quotients have the nicest possible local properties , so are metrizable manifolds with induced smooth structures .",
    "that is , we require the simplest possible dynamics allowing closed orbits ( and sometimes fixed points ) . in the leading question of his problem list @xcite , arnold observed that every smooth manifold @xmath3 homeomorphic to @xmath4 is the quotient of a flow on @xmath5 , since @xmath6 must be diffeomorphic to @xmath5 .",
    "since there are uncountably many diffeomorphism types of such manifolds @xmath3 ( the _ exotic smoothings _ of @xmath4 , see @xcite , @xcite ) , we obtain uncountably many flows on @xmath5 that are topologically trivial ( conjugate by a homeomorphism to the product flow on @xmath7 ) but smoothly distinguished from each other by the diffeomorphism type of the quotient space .",
    "this motivates the more general question of which @xmath8-manifolds can arise as quotients of flows on @xmath9 or other simple open manifolds .",
    "one might expect that such quotients must be open , and perhaps , in light of the above homotopy theoretic results , that a manifold quotient of @xmath9 must be contractible .",
    "however , calcut @xcite constructed a quadratic vector field on @xmath10 with quotient @xmath11 .",
    "the present paper shows that this is a much more general phenomenon .",
    "we construct a wide variety of smooth @xmath8-manifolds , both open and closed , as quotients of @xmath9 and other simple manifolds , with quotients exhibiting a broad range of homology , intersection forms and exotic smooth structures .",
    "the manifold condition on quotients tightly constrains the local structure of flows , but all of our examples are locally even more tightly controlled . to create interesting topology , we allow circles as orbits . however , we require their poincar maps to be the identity , so they have neighborhoods realized as trivial circle bundles .",
    "all of the compact orbits appearing in section  [ 2h ] have this form . while the homotopy types of circle bundles are highly constrained by the long exact homotopy sequence , our flows with only some circle orbits",
    "have much more flexibility , allowing us to control the fundamental group and second betti number of the quotient , subject only to @xmath12-surjectivity of the quotient map .",
    "( the same method also yields examples of higher - dimensional foliations ; see the final paragraph of this paper . ) in section  [ higher ] , we gain control of higher homology by also allowing fixed points .",
    "the manifold quotient condition tightly constrains the fixed set .",
    "however , we canonically obtain a smooth manifold quotient from a codimension-4 fixed set whose meridians are 3-spheres with the hopf circle action : the meridians descend to meridian 2-spheres , so the fixed set descends to have codimension three .",
    "the quotient map has a quadratic local model , and can be thought of as a generalization of a 2-fold branched covering map .    to construct our examples",
    ", we consider quotient manifolds as handlebodies ( with open handles ) .",
    "calcut exhibited @xmath11 as the quotient of a flow on @xmath10 by starting with the hopf fibration @xmath13 and removing a point from the domain .",
    "note that @xmath11 is built with a handle of each even index through @xmath14 , but the lifts of all but the 0-handle are `` invisible '' in the domain @xmath10 .",
    "since quotient maps of flows are always surjective on @xmath12 ( when the quotient is a manifold and hence semilocally simply connected ) , it is impossible to have 1-handles that are invisible in this manner .",
    "however , close inspection of the invisible 2-handle in calcut s example reveals how it functions , allowing us to construct such 2-handles more generally .",
    "we investigate such invisible 2-handles in section  [ 2h ] .",
    "then we construct higher - index handles in section  [ higher ] by replacing the hopf map @xmath15 by its iterated suspensions .",
    "the resulting invisible @xmath16-handles have nonempty fixed - point sets of the sort described previously , but allow us to control higher homology of the smooth quotient .",
    "it remains an open question whether the higher - index handles of the hopf map to @xmath11 can be exploited to yield fixed - point free flows with invisible @xmath16-handles for even @xmath17 ( see section  [ further ] ) .",
    "our main theorems assert that if an @xmath8-manifold @xmath18 is obtained from another manifold @xmath19 by attaching a layer of open handles of index at least two , then it is the quotient of a flow on @xmath20 .",
    "( see theorem  [ main ] for 2-handles and fixed - point free flows , and theorem  [ high ] in general . )",
    "we immediately see ( corollaries  [ contr ] and [ highapps](a ) ) that when @xmath19 is contractible , @xmath18 is the quotient of some flow on @xmath9 .",
    "this gives almost complete control of the homology and intersection pairing of quotient manifolds of flows on @xmath9 ( example  [ examples](a ) and corollary  [ highapps](b ) ) although they must be simply connected .",
    "we also obtain every compact homotopy @xmath8-sphere ( @xmath21 ) as such a quotient ( examples  [ spheres](a , c ) ) .",
    "section  [ 2h ] gives further applications of invisible 2-handles , which are expanded to higher homology in section  [ higher ] ( corollary  [ highapps ] and remarks  [ highapprem ] ) .",
    "corollary  [ group ] gives a counterpoint to @xmath12-surjectivity of quotient maps : _ every _ epimorphism of countably generated groups is induced by the quotient map of some flow with manifold quotient ( of fixed dimension four or larger ) , and for many manifolds @xmath19 , there are such flows on @xmath20 realizing all quotients of @xmath22 .",
    "corollary  [ all ] observes that every oriented @xmath8-manifold admitting a proper morse function , bounded below , whose indices are at most two , is a quotient of a flow on @xmath23 for some discrete , closed @xmath24 , with a similar result in the nonorientable case . in particular , every oriented surface ( possibly closed or with infinite topology ) is a quotient of a flow on @xmath25 minus parallel lines , every oriented , open 3-manifold is a quotient of @xmath4 minus parallel planes , and various related results hold for 4- and 5-manifolds ( examples  [ low ] ) .",
    "the tools developed in this paper allow a deeper study of exotic flows of the sort first introduced in dimension five by arnold .",
    "we call two flows _ topologically _ ( respectively _ smoothly _ ) _ equivalent _ if they are conjugate by a homeomorphism ( resp .",
    "diffeomorphism ) .",
    "`` most '' smooth 4-manifolds @xmath26 have infinitely many diffeomorphism types of exotic smoothings ( uncountably many in the noncompact case ) , such that the corresponding smoothings on @xmath27 are diffeomorphic .",
    "as arnold observed , we can interpret these as topologically equivalent but smoothly inequivalent flows on the 5-manifolds @xmath27 , distinguished by the diffeomorphism types of their quotients .",
    "since these are product flows , their quotient maps are homotopy equivalences . in contrast , we show ( example  [ examples](b ) , cf .",
    "also corollary  [ last ] ) that @xmath5 has infinitely many topologically equivalent but smoothly inequivalent flows with quotient realizing any preassigned intersection form , and some forms are realized by uncountable families .",
    "all of these 5-dimensional families , like those of arnold , are unstable under cartesian product with @xmath28 .",
    "that is , the flows within each family become smoothly equivalent if we take their product with the flow of velocity zero on @xmath28 ( or any other manifold of positive dimension ) . using handles of higher index ( examples  [ spheres ] )",
    "we can instead construct finite families of exotic flows on @xmath9 that are stable under product with @xmath28 ( although their behavior under iterated stabilization , i.e. , product with @xmath29 , is less clear ) .",
    "on the other hand , example  [ spheres](e ) exhibits unsmoothable topological flows on smooth manifolds , i.e. , 1-parameter groups of homeomorphisms that are not conjugate by a homeomorphism to a smooth flow on any manifold .",
    "we find such flows on @xmath1 whenever @xmath0 that are unsmoothable since their quotient manifolds are , but are smoothable in a neighborhood of each orbit .    except where otherwise stated , all manifolds in this paper are assumed to be metrizable , smooth , connected and without boundary .",
    "disks , particularly the disks @xmath30 and @xmath31 of radius one and two , are compact , and handlebodies have boundaries coming from the boundaries of their compact handles .",
    "however , we will also consider open handles attached at infinity to open manifolds .",
    "embeddings are smooth , injective immersions , and need not be proper .",
    "an annulus is the difference of two concentric open or closed disks of the same dimension , diffeomorphic to the product of a sphere with an interval or ray .",
    "flows will be smooth ( @xmath32 ) and complete ( defined for all time ) with fixed - point sets of codimension four , and those of section  [ 2h ] will be fixed - point free .",
    "the quotient manifolds will necessarily be orientable if and only if the domains are orientable .",
    "our main results are obtained by modifying a flow to add handles to its quotient without changing the diffeomorphism type of the manifold supporting the flow .",
    "we begin by adapting the notion of attaching handles to the setting of open manifolds , in a way that is both more general than the compact version and more convenient for our purposes .",

    "the usual notion of attaching a layer of handles to the boundary of a compact manifold has the effect of attaching handles at infinity to the interior .",
