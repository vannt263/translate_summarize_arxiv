    "hot methane is important in cool stars , brown dwarfs , exoplanets , gas turbine engines and elsewhere .",
    "there is a pressing need for an accurate and complete spectroscopic database for methane at elevated temperatures .",
    "we present a comprehensive spectroscopic line list for methane containing almost 10 billion transitions , 2000 times more than any previous compilation , covering a broad spectroscopic range and applicable for temperatures up to 1500 k. we demonstrate that such a line list is essential for correctly modelling the brown dwarf 2mass 0559 - 14 and leads to large changes in exoplanet models . we believe that this line list will make a large impact on the field of exoplanets and cool stars .     + ethane is an important terrestrial green house gas @xcite and the active component in many flames .",
    "it is also the major active atmospheric constituent of cool carbon stars and the t - dwarf class of brown dwarfs are often referred to as `` methane dwarfs '' @xcite .",
    "methane is also important for the newly discovered y dwarfs @xcite , and even l dwarfs @xcite .",
    "methane has been detected in exoplanets @xcite , where it has long been thought of as a potential biosignature @xcite on earth - like planets .",
    "equilibrium chemistry models for exoplanet gas giants @xcite predict methane to be the main carbon containing species at temperatures below 1500 k , so measuring its abundance is essential for determining the key c / o ratio in these objects @xcite . even though methane is therefore likely to be important in many of the giant exoplanets detected so far ,",
    "its observed abundance remains controversial @xcite .",
    "studies of many topics , ranging from the astronomical ones just mentioned to halon flame inhibitors @xcite , combustion @xcite , gas turbine energies @xcite and exhausts @xcite , all rely on an understanding of the spectroscopy of hot methane .",
    "however even at room temperature the spectrum of methane is complex and not fully characterized @xcite . at elevated temperatures , above about 1000  k , billions of spectral lines become active and modelling hot methane with available laboratory data has often proved difficult @xcite .",
    "the importance of an accurate and complete line list for methane has been stressed many times @xcite .    none of the available ch@xmath2  line lists are complete at elevated temperatures @xcite .",
    "the recently updated ch@xmath2  data @xcite included in the 2012 edition of hitran @xcite is designed to work at earth atmosphere temperatures .",
    "current high temperature line lists include ones computed from first principles @xcite and semi - empirically @xcite as well as ( partial ) experimental line lists @xcite .",
    "as demonstrated below , all of these compilations underestimate the number of methane transitions that need to be considered at elevated temperatures by many orders of magnitude .    here",
    "we present a new methane line list computed variationally which contains 9.8 billion transitions and is designed to be complete for temperatures up to 1500  k. it covers wavelengths from the far - infrared to 0.9  @xmath3 m .",
    "this can be compared to about 340000 transitions of @xmath0ch@xmath1 known experimentally for the same wavelength region .",
    "we show that proper inclusion of the huge increase in hot transitions which are important at elevated temperatures is crucial for accurate characterization of atmospheres of brown dwarfs and exoplanets , especially when observed in the near - infrared .",
    "methane has 5 atoms and hence 9 vibrational modes , more than are routinely treated using variational nuclear motion programs .",
    "however it is a highly symmetric molecule belonging to the @xmath4  point group which allows some simplification .",
    "the ro - vibrational energies , associated wave functions and einstein a coefficients , which are required to generate spectra , were computed using a specifically adapted version of the nuclear motion program trove @xcite in conjunction with a new spectroscopically obtained potential energy surface ( pes ) and a previously - calculated , _ ab initio _  dipole moment surface dms @xcite .",
    "the energies were computed variationally , i.e. by diagonalizing a large set of ( 200 ) hamiltonian matrices constructed using a suitable basis set in the symmetry adapted representation .",
    "the largest matrix considered ( for rotational state @xmath5 ) had @xmath6 elements and was diagonalized using the ( non - sparse ) scalapack mpi direct eigensolver pdsyevr .",
    "a direct diagonalization of large non - sparse matrices is the bottleneck in variational computation of comprehensive line lists for polyatomic molecules .",
    "these calculations were performed at the uk national cosmology supercomputer cosmos and required about 1.5 m cpu hours .",
    "calculating the line intensities is also computationally expensive but more straightforward ; these calculations are independent and thus can be very efficiently parallelized .",
    "this part of the project was performed at the cambridge high performance computing cluster darwin ( @xmath73.0 m cpu hours ) .",
    "full details of the computational method used to construct the line list will be published elsewhere @xcite .    to reduce computational requirements",
    ", we imposed an upper energy limit of @xmath8 18000  @xmath9 . with this threshold for all rotational states up to @xmath5",
    ", we obtained 6603166 energy levels .",
    "einstein a coefficients were computed for all transitions involving rotational excitations @xmath10 with the lower and upper state energies ranging up to @xmath11 8000  @xmath9and @xmath12 18000  @xmath9 , respectively , and covering the wavenumber range up to 12000  @xmath9  ( 0.83  @xmath3 m ) .",
    "a total of 9819605160 transitions were computed .",
    "the energy values , transition wavenumbers , einstein a coefficients and degeneracy factors comprise our 10to10 line list which can be obtained from ` www.exomol.com ` .    the large basis set used in the diagonalization plus the combination of an accurate variational model , an empirical pes and _ ab initio _  dmss obtained at the high level of _ ab initio _  theory @xcite all contribute to the high quality of the 10to10 line list .",
    "further technical details are given in the supporting material .",
    "this line list forms a key part of the exomol project @xcite , which aims to provide such lists for all molecules likely to be detected in exoplanetary atmospheres .",
    "typical agreement with the experimental spectra is shown in fig .  [",
    "f : nu3 ] , where the absorption intensities for the @xmath13 ( stretching asymmetric ) band at @xmath14  k are shown as a stick diagram .",
    "not only do the theoretical line positions agree well with the measurements , the absolute intensities reproduce the experimental data with an accuracy comparable to experiment , where the latter is available .",
    "validation by experiment is important because it gives us confidence in our predictions of the methane opacity . indeed , our intensities are based purely on the quality of the _ ab initio _",
    "dms , without any empirical adjustments .",
    "the new 10to10 line list offers at least 200 times more lines than any other previous compilation , including the most complete : the empirically constructed mecasda line list @xcite .",
    "most of these extra transitions come from spectral lines which involve high rotational levels and/or transitions between vibrationally excited states ( `` hot bands '' ) .",
    "these transitions are generally very weak in room - temperature spectral but become important when the temperature increases . to demonstrate the importance of these transitions we have counted the number of active transitions as a function of temperature . at room temperature only 1  %  of the 10to10 lines have intensities stronger than @xmath15  cm / molecule , which roughly corresponds to the scope of ch@xmath2  in the hitran  2012 database @xcite .",
    "this shows that most 10to10 lines are unimportant for room temperature applications .",
    "however at @xmath16  k , 98  %  of 10to10 lines have absorption intensities stronger than @xmath17  cm / molecule , 80  %  are stronger than @xmath15 and 40  % are stronger than @xmath18 cm / molecule . besides the density of these lines is extremely high as 66000 lines per @xmath9 at @xmath19 1500  k for the standard hitran cutoff of @xmath18  cm / molecule .",
    "this means that billions of transitions are required to model the high temperature spectrum of methane .",
    "it is common astronomical practice to estimate the integrated flux within so - called @xmath20 colors , or bands , which correspond to the transparency windows of the earth atmosphere in the infrared .",
    "here we present integrated opacities of ch@xmath2at different temperatures for the three main methane spectroscopic windows : the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 bands which are defined as 1.11.4  @xmath3 m , 1.51.8  @xmath3 m , and 2.02.4  @xmath3 m , respectively .",
    "[ f : jhk ] compares 10to10 integrated intensities with estimates obtained from the hitran and mecasda databases .",
    "agreement is good at room temperature for the @xmath22 and @xmath23 but _ all _ previous compilations show a rapid drop in the methane opacity with temperature , while 10to10 suggests it is approximately flat .",
    "10to10 gives enhanced absorption in the @xmath21 band for all temperatures which is to be expected as this region is poorly sampled experimentally @xcite . at high temperatures ( @xmath24  k ) , however , the 10to10 intensities deviate from a flat line , showing incompleteness of the 10to10 line list for such temperatures . in order to improve the temperature coverage to , say , 2000  k , the lower energy threshold has to be also extended at least up to 10,000  @xmath9  and the rotational excitations to about @xmath25 .",
    "this work is currently underway .",
    "in fig .  [ f : t4.5 ] we present the results of modelling a spectrum of the bright t4.5 dwarf 2mass 0559 - 14 taken from the irtf spectral library @xcite . at this",
    "spectral type methane bands at around 1.6 and 2.2 @xmath3 m  are becoming prominent features in the spectrum .",
    "previous analyses of the spectrum of this object have derived effective temperatures in the range 10001200  k and gravities of @xmath26 ( in cgs units ) = 4.5 - 5.0 @xcite .",
    "the model spectrum was calculated using the vstar code and the methods described by bailey &  kedziora - chudczer @xcite .",
    "the model is based on a pressure temperature structure for effective temperature 1200 k and @xmath27 @xcite and assumes equilibrium chemistry .",
    "the new model also uses updated absorption coefficients for the h@xmath28h@xmath28 collision induced absorption ( cia ) @xcite .",
    "the blue spectrum on figure  [ f : t4.5 ] corresponds to the previous model which used the stds methane line list @xcite , a precursor to the recent mecasda line list @xcite .",
    "the red spectrum is the new model using the 10to10 line list : the comparison of the new vstar model using 10to10 with the old vstar model using the stds list provides the direct comparison of the effect of just changing the opacities .",
    "also included on the plot are results obtained using the bt - settl model @xcite for @xmath29 k and @xmath27 which is also based on the old line lists and similarly fails to match the observations in the regions of strong methane absorption    it can be seen that the new model using the 10to10 list fits the data much better , particularly in the 1.6 to 1.8 @xmath3 m region . in this region",
    "the stds based lists used previously include no hot bands , and clearly fail to properly represent the absorption in this region .",
    "figure  [ f : t4.5close ] shows two expanded views of the spectral regions sensitive to methane and shows that much of the detailed line structure is reproduced by the model .",
    "the vstar model used here , which is a cloud free model , fits the data for this object significantly better than the bt - settl model which include clouds .    a line list as large as 10to10 presents something of a challenge for a line - by - line modelling code such as vstar .",
    "initially we tried to model the spectrum using a line intensity cutoff of 10@xmath30 cm / molecule at 1500 k to reduce the number of lines used in the line - by - line code .",
    "however , this procedure was found to produce significantly less absorption than the use of the full line list .",
    "even though the lines below this cutoff are very weak , the very large number of them means they still contribute significant total absorption . in order to speed up the line - by - line calculations we have divided the lines into strong and weak lines .",
    "only the strong methane lines are modelled with a full line shape calculation . for the many weak lines we simply add the total line absorption into the single wavelength bin in which the line center lies .",
    "given that there are many more lines than there are wavelength bins in our spectrum these lines are clearly never going to be individually resolved . in the models presented here the boundary between strong and weak lines was set at @xmath31 cm / molecule at the temperature of the atmospheric layer being modelled .",
    "it remains very challenging to obtain even relatively crude spectra of exoplanets .",
    "the most productive technique has been monitoring the variation in observed starlight for those planets that transit their host star as viewed from earth , for both the primary and secondary eclipse .",
    "interpreting these observations requires the construction of detailed radiative transfer models .",
    "tau @xcite is a one - dimensional radiative transfer code for transmission spectroscopy of exoplanets , especially designed for hot jupiters with near stellar orbits .",
    "it uses a line - by - line integration scheme to model transmission of the radiation from the parent star through the atmosphere of the orbiting planet , equating physically to observations of the radius ratio ( transit depth ) as a function of wavelength in the primary transit geometry .",
    "abundances of absorbing molecules in the atmosphere can hence be estimated by hypothesizing compositions and comparing to any available observations .",
    "specifically , the algorithm calculates the optical depth of the atmosphere ( and hence effective radius of the planet ) at a particular wavelength , given model trace molecular abundances and the atmospheric structure and absorbing behavior ( in the form of line lists ) of those molecules .",
    "a transit depth can hence be calculated as the ratio of the squared radii of the planet and the star , and a spectrum created of absorption as a function of wavelength .",
    "we used tau @xcite to generate models to simulate the atmospheric transmission of the warm neptune gj  436b @xcite and of the hot jupiter hd  189733b @xcite , see figs .",
    "[ f : gj436b ] and [ f : hd189 ] respectively .",
    "both these exoplanets have been extensively observed @xcite .",
    "assuming for gj  436b an equilibrium temperature of about 700  k , the atmosphere of this planet is expected to contain significant quantities of methane as a trace absorber in chemical equilibrium @xcite as well as some water . in models for gj  436b containing only methane ,",
    "the differences in the line lists result in an observed theoretical radius ratio increase @xmath32 of up to 0.3%  at 5  @xmath3 m  and below 2  @xmath3 m  ( after smoothing ) .",
    "similar models on the well - studied exoplanet hd  189733b , a hot jupiter with an effective temperature 1200  k , found an increase of up to 0.6% , see fig .",
    "[ f : hd189 ] . if due solely to methane opacity",
    ", this would require an increase in modelled abundance of approximately 5 times using the hitran opacities to match the level predicted by 10to10 .",
    "a large portion of these regions is however screened by water .",
    "this can be also seen in figs .",
    "[ f : gj436b ] and [ f : hd189 ] , where the results of the ch@xmath2+h@xmath33o models are presented .",
    "in particular , 5  @xmath3 m  regions is completely dominated by the water absorption making the effect from the new methane data at this wavelength negligible .",
    "however the windows around 1.6  @xmath3 m  and 2.2  @xmath3 m  show a significant difference with an increase of the radius ratio of up to 0.1  %  for the ch@xmath2(10to10)+h@xmath33o model of the hot jupiter hd  189733b in fig .",
    "[ f : hd189 ] . the corresponding mixing ratios of ch@xmath1 and h@xmath28o were obtained by fitting to the observations available in the literature . in addition to the 10to10 and hitran  2012 line lists for methane , the bt2 line list @xcite was used to model absorption by water .",
    "it should be noted that the large uncertainties of the existing observation data points , some of which appear to contradict each other ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ f : gj436b ] ) , lead to a very large number of possible solutions .",
    "figures  [ f : gj436b ] and [ f : hd189 ] show only one selection of models as an example illustrating the significance of the potential errors involved in using line lists that are known to have missing opacities .",
    "these errors may not have been obvious in previous studies , since the methane discrepancies are often masked to a large extent by the inclusion of realistic quantities of water at around the @xmath34 abundance level .",
    "we present a new comprehensive line list for methane suitable for modelling absorptions up to 1500  k. an important consideration is that use of 10to10 increases opacities generated by methane which changes the level of the atmosphere at which methane is absorbed or emitted .",
    "future exoplanet models will have to account for the new opacities to retain self - consistency .",
    "the increased methane opacities are expected to have some effect on the pressure temperature profile and thermal evolution of brown dwarfs and exoplanets .",
    "however this is beyond the scope of the models considered here .",
    "such effects can be properly evaluated when the new opacities are included in self - consistent structure models for the atmospheres and interiors .",
    "however , we would expect the changes to be relatively small as the extra opacity seen with the new line list is a relatively small fraction of the total opacity due to all sources , such as water , methane , cia .    despite the size of the 10to10 line list it is still not complete .",
    "we can estimate the effect of the incompleteness of the 10to10 line list by comparison with the high temperature partition function @xcite .",
    "the critical parameter here is the constraint introduced by our use of a lower energy threshold at @xmath35  @xmath9  on the states that can be thermally occupied .",
    "the partition function of ch@xmath2  computed using 10to10 levels lying below this threshold suggests that at 1500  k these sample about 85  % of the total contribution .",
    "this means that , 10to10 remains incomplete and that for higher temperatures an even larger number of lines will be required for accurate modeling of the opacity of methane in hot media such as exoplanets and ( cool ) stars .",
