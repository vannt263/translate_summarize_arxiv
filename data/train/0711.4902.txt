    "constraint satisfaction problems ( csps ) are the industrial , commercial and often very large - scale analogues of popular leisure - time pursuits such as the sudoku puzzle .",
    "they can be formulated abstractly in terms of @xmath3 variables @xmath4 and @xmath5 constraints , where each variable @xmath6 takes a value in a finite set and each constraint forbids certain combinations of values to the variables .",
    "the classical example of a worst - case intractable @xcite constraint satisfaction problem is the _ @xmath0-satisfiability _ ( @xmath0-sat ) problem @xcite , where each variable takes a boolean value ( either 0 or 1 ) and each constraint is a clause over @xmath0 variables disallowing one out of the @xmath7 possible combinations of values .",
    "an instance of @xmath0-sat can also be interpreted directly as a spin system of statistical physics .",
    "each constraint equals to a @xmath0-spin interaction in a hamiltonian , and thus spins represent the original variables ; the ground states of the hamiltonian correspond to the solutions , that is , assignments of values to the variables that satisfy all the clauses ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it was first observed in the context of @xmath0-sat , and then in the context of several other csps @xcite , that ensembles of random csps have a `` phase transition , '' a sharp change in the likelihood to be solvable @xcite .",
    "empirically , algorithms have been observed to fail or have difficulties in the immediate neighbourhood of such phase transition points , a fact which has given rise to a large literature @xcite .",
    "large unstructured csps are solved either by general - purpose deterministic methods , of which the archetypal example is the davis - putnam - logemann - loveland ( dpll ) algorithm @xcite , or using more tailored algorithms , such as the survey propagation ( sp ) algorithm @xcite motivated by spin glass theory , or variants of stochastic local search techniques @xcite .",
    "stochastic local search ( sls ) methods are competitive on some of the largest and least structured problems of interest @xcite , in particular on _ random _ @xmath0-sat instances , which are constructed by selecting independently and uniformly at random @xmath5 clauses over the @xmath3 variables , where the parameter controlling the satisfiability of an instance is @xmath8 , the ratio of clauses to variables .",
    "sls algorithms work by making successive random changes to a trial configuration ( assignment of values to the variables ) based on information about a local neighbourhood in the set of all possible configurations .",
    "their modern history starts with the celebrated simulated annealing algorithm of kirkpatrick , gelatt and vecchi @xcite . from the perspective of @xmath0-sat , the next fundamental step forward was an algorithm of papadimitriou @xcite ,",
    "now often called randomwalksat , which introduced the notion of _ focusing _ the random moves to rectify broken constraints .",
    "randomwalksat has been shown , by simulation and theoretical arguments , to solve the paradigmatic case of random 3-satisfiability up to about @xmath9 clauses per variable , almost surely in time linear in @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "a subsequent influential development occurred with selman , kautz and cohen s walksat algorithm @xcite , which mixes focused random and greedy moves for better performance .",
    "we have previously shown that walksat and several other stochastic local search heuristics work almost surely in linear time , up to at least @xmath10 clauses per variable @xcite . in comparison ,",
    "the satisfiability / unsatisfiability threshold of random 3-satisfiability is believed to be at @xmath11 clauses per variable @xcite .",
    "the present work carries out a first systematic empirical study of random @xmath0-sat for @xmath2 .",
    "our motivation for this study is threefold .",
    "_ testing the limits of local search .",
    "_ it has been empirically observed for @xmath12 that many sls algorithms have a linear - time regime , which extends to the immediate vicinity of the phase transition point @xcite .",
    "thus , a similar investigation for higher @xmath0 is warranted .",
    "here we focus on @xmath2 .    _ the structure of the space of solutions .",
    "_ recent rigorous results and non - rigorous predictions from spin - glass theory suggest that the structure of the space of solutions of a random @xmath0-sat instance undergoes various qualitative changes for @xmath13 , the implications of which to the performance of algorithms should be investigated .",
    "mzard , mora and zecchina @xcite have shown rigorously that for @xmath14 the space of solutions of random @xmath0-sat breaks into multiple clusters separated by extensive hamming distance .",
    "( the hamming distance of two boolean vectors of length @xmath3 is the number positions in which the vectors differ divided by @xmath3 . ) in more precise terms , an instance of @xmath0-sat is @xmath15-_satisfiable _ if it has a pair of solutions with normalized hamming distance @xmath16 .",
    "mzard , mora and zecchina @xcite show that , for @xmath14 , there exists an interval @xmath17 , @xmath18 , such that , with high probability as @xmath19 , a random instance ceases to be @xmath15-satisfiable for all @xmath20 at a smaller value of @xmath1 before it ceases to be @xmath15-satisfiable for some @xmath21 $ ] .    for @xmath2 , we see no evidence of gaps in the empirical @xmath15-satisfiability spectrum in the linear - time regime of sls algorithms , which includes the predicted spin - glass theoretic clustering points . in light of the rigorous results for @xmath14",
    ", this suggests that the cases @xmath2 and @xmath22 may be qualitatively different .",
    "moreover , we observe that recently predicted spin - glass - theoretic clustering thresholds ( krzakala et al .",
    "@xcite ) have no impact on algorithm performance .",
    "this puts forth the question whether the energy landscape of random @xmath0-sat for small @xmath0 is in some regard more elementary than has been previously believed .",
    "_ the structure of the energy landscape . _ in the context of random @xmath0-sat it is common folklore that sls algorithms appear to benefit from circumspect descent in energy , that is , from a very conservative policy of lowering the number of clauses not satisfied by the trial configuration . to explore this issue further",
    ", we introduce a new sls algorithm which we call _ chainsat_. it is based on three ideas : ( 1 ) focusing , ( 2 ) easing difficult - to - satisfy constraints by so - called _ chaining _ moves , and ( 3 ) _ never going upwards in energy _ ; that is , the number of unsatisfied clauses is a non - increasing function of the sequence of trial configurations traversed by the algorithm .    by design , chainsat can not escape from a local minimum of energy in the energy landscape . yet , empirically chainsat is able to find a solution , almost surely in linear time , up to values of @xmath1 reached by sls algorithms that are allowed to go up in energy , such as the focused metropolis search @xcite .",
    "this observation further supports the position that random @xmath0-sat for small @xmath0 may be more elementary than has been previously believed .",
    "section 2 documents our experiments with the fms algorithm on random @xmath0-sat for @xmath2 .",
    "section 3 contains an empirical investigation of @xmath15-satisfiability in random @xmath0-sat for @xmath2 using the fms algorithm .",

    "the algorithm becomes `` too greedy '' leading to a divergence of solution times .",
    "thus , to obtain performance linear in @xmath3 , it is necessary to carefully optimize the parameter @xmath32 .",
    "figure  [ fig : fms - temp ] shows a typical result of the optimization of the temperature parameter @xmath32 for random @xmath0-sat with @xmath2 .",
    "two quantities are plotted , the fraction of instances solved ( within a threshold number of flips per variable ) , and , when all instances are solved , the corresponding average solution time .",
    "it is evident from figure  [ fig : fms - temp ] that for @xmath2 and @xmath33 the operating window of fms is already very narrow ; thus it is striking that the empirical performance of fms is almost surely linear in @xmath3 within the window .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fms - k4-scaling ] we present empirical evidence that fms almost surely runs in time linear in @xmath3 for instances of random @xmath0-satisfiability with @xmath2 .",
    "the fact that the curves get steeper with increasing @xmath3 implies concentration of solution times , or that above - average and below - average solution times get rarer with @xmath3 .",
    "note that the scaling implies performance almost surely linear in @xmath3 , and demonstrates that the linear - time regime of fms extends beyond the predicted @xcite spin - glass theoretic `` dynamical '' and `` condensation '' transitions points .",
    "our experimental setup to investigate @xmath15-satisfiability is as follows . for given values of @xmath1 and @xmath3",
    ", we first generate a random @xmath0-sat instance , and find one reference solution of this instance using fms .",
    "then , using fms , we search for other solutions in the same instance .",
    "the initial configuration @xmath26 for fms is selected uniformly at random from the set of all configurations having a given hamming distance to the reference solution .",
    "when fms finds a solution , we record the distance @xmath15 of the solution found to the reference solution .    our experiments on random @xmath0-sat for @xmath2 did not reveal any gaps in the @xmath15-satisfiability spectrum , even for @xmath34 , beyond the predicted spin - glass theoretic `` dynamical '' and `` condensation '' transitions points @xcite .",
    "in particular , figure  [ fig : fms_dist1 ] gives empirical evidence that solutions are found at all distances smaller than the typical distance of solutions found by fms .",
    "this is in contrast to the numerical results of battaglia et al . for a balanced version of @xmath35 @xcite .    here",
    "it should be pointed out that the solutions found by stochastic local search need _ not _ be typical solutions in the space of all solutions : there can be other solutions that are not reached by fms or other algorithms .",
    "evidence of this is reflected in the `` whiteness '' status of solutions ( see  @xcite , @xcite , and section [ sect : white])all the solutions found in our experiments were completely white , that is , they do not have locally frozen variables .",
    "one can of course imagine that a `` typical solution '' is not white , under the circumstances examined here , but as noted there is no evidence of the existence of such .    figure  [ fig : fms_dist2 ] summarizes the results of a scaling analysis with increasing @xmath3 over five random instances and reference solutions .",
    "the distance distributions appear to converge to some specific curve without vertical sections , the absence of which suggests that the @xmath15-satisfiability spectrum has no gaps below the typical distance of solutions found by fms in the limit of infinite @xmath3 .",
    "figure  [ fig : fms_dist3 ] summarizes the results of a scaling analysis with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "we see that the typical distance between solutions found by fms decreases with increasing @xmath1 , and that no clear gaps are apparent in the distance data .",
    "a new heuristic which never moves up in energy is here shown to solve random @xmath0-satisfiability problems almost surely in time linear in @xmath3 , for @xmath23 .",
    "our new heuristic , chainsat , is given in pseudocode in figure  [ fig : chainsat ] .",
    "the algorithm ( a ) never increases the energy of the current configuration @xmath26 ; and ( b ) exercises circumspection in decreasing the energy .",
    "in particular , moves that decrease the energy are taken only sporadically compared with equi - energetic moves and chaining moves .",
    "the latter are designed to alleviate critically satisfied constraints by proceeding in `` chains '' of variable - clause - variable until a variable is found which can be flipped without increase in energy .",
    "focusing is employed for the non - chaining moves .",
    "the structure of chainsat has the basic idea of helping to flip a variable to satisfy an original broken constraint .",

    "we omit data related to the optimization of these parameters since the procedure is simply an empirical ( vary the parameters , check outcome ) , similar to one documented for the fms algorithm in figure  [ fig : fms - temp ] .      in figure",
    "[ fig : chainsat - scaling ] we present empirical evidence that chainsat almost surely runs in time linear in @xmath3 for random @xmath0-satisfiability problems with @xmath23 .",
    "the fact that the curves get steeper with increasing @xmath3 implies concentration of solution times , or that above - average and below - average solution times get rarer with @xmath3 .",
    "since the algorithm never goes uphill in the energy landscape , local energy minima can not be an obstruction to finding solutions , at least in the region of the energy landscape visited by this algorithm .",
    "on the other hand , when chainsat fails to find a solution in linear time , this can also result from simply getting lost  in particular , the fraction of moves that lower the energy over those that keep it constant may dwindle to zero .      to provide a further empirical analysis of chainsat , we next present figure  [ fig : chain ] .",
    "this is discussed not in terms of solution times and the range of @xmath1 achieveable with a bit of tuning , but in terms of two quantities : ( i ) the average chain length @xmath41 during the course of finding a solution and ( ii ) the average whiteness depth ( awd ) . in more precise terms , the average chain length is @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the total number of iterations of the main loop of chainsat and @xmath44 is the number of times the if - statement controlled by the chaining flag in the main loop is executed .    the awd is related to the result of the so - called whitening procedure @xcite , described in pseudocode in figure [ fig : whitening ] , that is applied to the solution found when chainsat terminates .",
    "the whiteness depth of a variable is defined as the value of @xmath45 in the whitening procedure at the time the variable gets marked ( whitened ) ; the value is infinite if the variable never gets marked ( whitened ) during the whitening procedure .",
    "the awd of a solution is the average of the whiteness depths of the variables .",
    "see @xcite for an empirical discussion of awd in the context of random @xmath0-sat for @xmath12 .",
    "the key observation here is that the solutions found by chainsat all have a finite awd .",
    "this in loose terms means that there is `` slack '' in the solution .",

    "note that the ratio awd/@xmath41 increases with @xmath1 .",
    "we have here shown empirically that local search heuristics can be designed to avoid traps and `` freezing '' in random @xmath0-satisfiability , with solution times scaling linearly in @xmath3 .",
    "this requires that circumspection is exercised  too greedy a descent causes the studied algorithms to fail for reasons unclear .",
    "a physics inspired interpretation is that during a run the algorithm has to `` equilibrate '' on a constant energy surface .    in terms of the parameter @xmath1 , it is the pertinent question as to how far the `` easy '' region from which one finds these solutions extends . for small @xmath0",
    "it may be possible that this is true all the way to the satisfiability / unsatisfiability transition point .",
    "the empirical evidence we have here presented points towards a divergence of the prefactor of the linear scaling in problem size well below @xmath48 . furthermore , this divergence is stronger for higher values of @xmath0 . for large values of @xmath0 ,",
    "the absence of traps may however in any case be considered unlikely , as the rigorous techniques used to show clustering of solutions for @xmath14 @xcite can also be used to show that there exist pairs of distant solutions separated by an extensive energy barrier from each other .",
    "this suggests also the existence of local minima separated by extensive barriers . on the other hand",
    ", our present results for small @xmath0 give no evidence in this direction .",
    "in particular , for @xmath2 we have shown empirically that the energy landscapes can be navigated with simple randomized heuristics beyond all so far predicted transition points , apart from the satisfiability / unsatisfiability transition itself .",
    "our experiments also strongly suggest that the space of solutions for @xmath49 at least up to @xmath34 does not break into multiple clusters separated by extensive distance .",
    "all the solutions found have `` slack '' in the sense that they have a finite awd .",
    "is there an efficient way to find solutions that are not `` white '' in this sense ; put otherwise , is the existence of `` white '' solutions necessary for `` easy '' solvability ?",
    "all these observations present further questions about the structure of the energy landscape , the solution space , and the workings of algorithms for random csps .",
    "they also leave us with challenges and constraints to theoretical attempts to understand these , including approaches from the physics of spin glasses .",
