    "relaxors , also called `` relaxor ferroelectrics '' , are a special class of ferroelectric material .",
    "relaxors have a highly frequency dependent dielectric response ( @xmath3 ) with a broad maximum in temperature .",
    "unlike normal ferroelectrics , the dielectric response in relaxors remains relatively large for a wide temperature range near t@xmath4 where @xmath3 peaks . because of their unusual dielectric and piezoelectric response ,",
    "relaxors have great potentials for applications  @xcite and have attracted much attention after they were first discovered in 1960 s  @xcite .",
    "pb(zn@xmath0nb@xmath1)o@xmath2 ( pzn ) and pb(mg@xmath0nb@xmath1)o@xmath2 ( pmn ) are two prototypical lead based perovskite relaxors taking the form of pb(bb)o@xmath2 . here",
    "the b - site is normally occupied by two cations with different valencies . for example , in pzn and pmn , zn@xmath5/mg@xmath5 and nb@xmath6 take a @xmath7 ratio on b - site to achieve an average valence of @xmath8 for charge conservation .",
    "the frustration between charge neutrality and lattice strain which does not favor a @xmath7 order makes it unlikely for any long - range cation / chemical order to form in these relaxor systems .",
    "the charge imbalance due to the randomness of b - site occupancy creates local random fields , which is the key in understanding many relaxor properties  @xcite .",
    "the formation of long - range polar order in relaxors can sometimes be suppressed by the random field .",
    "in fact , in pmn , no long - range ferroelectric order can be established under zero external field cooling  @xcite and the lattice structure remains cubic down to very low temperatures .",
    "only when cooled under an external electric field  @xcite pmn exhibits a long - range ferroelectric phase with rhombohedral ( r ) structure below its curie temperature t@xmath9  k.    the situation for pzn is slightly different .",
    "pure pzn was first believed to go into a rhombohedral ferroelectric phase at t@xmath10  k with zero field cooling ( zfc )  @xcite .",
    "however , recent work using high energy ( 67  kev ) x - ray diffraction suggested that the rhombohedral distortion observed before was only limited in a `` skin '' layer with thickness of tens of microns in these samples .",
    "instead , the bulk of unpoled single crystal pzn actually should have a near cubic lattice without detectable rhombohedral distortion  @xcite . with electric field poling , pzn can also exhibit a long - range polar order with clear rhombohedral distortion .",
    "this finding implies that pure pzn and pmn have more similarities than previously realized .",
    "nevertheless , the low temperature phase of ( unpoled ) pzn is not a real cubic paraelectric phase .",
    "it was initially called `` phase x '' because of its anomalous properties  @xcite , many of these can be attributed to strains and local inhomogeneities .",
    "doping with the conventional ferroelectric pbtio@xmath2 ( pt ) to form solid solutions of pzn-@xmath11pt and pmn-@xmath11pt also helps stabilizing the ferroelectric order . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , with relatively small pt doping , the low temperature phase of pmn-@xmath11pt and pzn-@xmath11pt is stabilized as rhombohedral . however , the charge imbalance due to frustration is still important and many anomalous features such as large strain , `` skin '' effect ( where the outer and inner parts of the crystal have different structures / lattice parameters ) are still present  @xcite .",
    "higher pt doping gradually suppresses relaxor properties and eventually the system becomes more like a normal ferroelectric with a tetragonal ( t ) low temperature phase .",
    "the phase boundary separating the relaxor / rhombohedral side and the ferroelectric / tetragonal side is called the `` morphortropic phase boundary '' ( mpb ) .",
    "it is near the mpb where the piezoelectric response - which tells us how good the material is in converting between mechanical and electrical forms of energy - reaches its maximum  @xcite .",
    "many studies have been therefore focused on the compositions near the mpb , and a narrow region of monoclinic phases has been discovered  @xcite . in a monoclinic ( m ) phase ,",
    "the polarization of the system is restricted to a plane  @xcite rather than being strictly restricted to one direction in the case of a rhombohedral ( r ) or tetragonal ( t ) phase .",
    "it has been argued that this freedom in the m phase helps facilitate the `` polarization rotation '' process and is responsible for the high piezoelectric response from these materials  @xcite .",
    "indeed later studies have shown that various m phases can also be induced by an external electric field for compositions near or slightly away from the mpb  @xcite , indicating that the long - range lattice structure here can be rather unstable and easily modified by external conditions .",
    "in addition to the chemical disorder / short - range order , short - range polar order is also present in relaxor systems .",
    "the concept of `` polar nano - regions '' ( pnr ) was initially proposed by burns and dacol  @xcite , to explain their results in optical measurements from a series of relaxor systems including pzn and pmn .",
    "it was found that their diffraction indices deviate from linear temperature behavior at a temperature t@xmath12 , later called the `` burns temperature '' , which is far above t@xmath4 .",
    "it was suggested that local polar clusters start to form at this temperature while the majority of the lattice still remain unpolarized .",
    "the existence of pnr makes a clear distinction between the paraelectric phase of normal ferroelectrics and the high temperature phase of relaxors .",
    "the large frequency dependency of @xmath3 can also be naturally explained with the relaxation process of pnr  @xcite . although it is almost certain that these local structures are associated with the frustration and charge imbalance in relaxor systems , the origin of the pnr and how they are formed is however , still not entirely understood .",
    "there are both experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite implications that they may be formed based on the chemical short - range order , but more studies are clear required .",
    "since then there have been numerous studies to probe pnr in relaxor systems including raman and dielectric measurements  @xcite , high resolution piezoelectric force microscopy  @xcite , x - ray  @xcite and neutron  @xcite diffuse scattering measurements , as well as pair density function ( pdf ) measurements  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the initial expectations , the pnr do not disappear or grow into large macroscopic ferroelectric domains when the systems goes into a long - range ordered phase .",
    "instead , they are found to persist and coexist with the long - range polar order  @xcite .",
    "the pnr also respond to external electric fields - instead of being completely suppressed , their behavior under field has been very interesting , and largely depends on the direction of the field .",
    "for instance , diffuse scattering from pnr in pzn-8%pt has only been partially suppressed by an external field along the tetragonal ( t ) [ 001 ] direction  @xcite . with an external field along the rhombohedral ( r ) [ 111 ] direction , a redistribution effect has been found between pnr with different polarizations  @xcite in pzn-@xmath11pt single crystals .",
    "similar effect has been observed in pmn-@xmath11pt systems as well  @xcite .",
    "most of these results suggest that the short - range polar order in pnr appears to be an essential part of the relaxor phase - even in the low temperature phase where long - range ferroelectric polar order is established .",
    "the two orders can coexist , sometimes compete with each other , but can also develop at the same time .",
    "in addition to understanding the structures and polarizations of pnr , it is more important to find out how these local structures can affect bulk materials properties .",
    "studies have shown that many anomalous properties in the long - range polar structures in pzn-@xmath11pt and pmn-@xmath11pt relaxors are closely related with the pnr .",
    "for example , diffuse scattering from the pnr have been shown to have contributions from both a polar component and a strain component  @xcite .",
    "the former comes from optic type atomic shifts ; while the latter arises from acoustic type atomic displacements which is directly associated with the large strain in the lattice .",
    "moreover , recent work indicates that the pnr can interact with various phonon modes  @xcite and could be responsible for the phase instability in relaxor compounds which is essential for achieving the high piezoelectric response .",
    "in the following sections , i will discuss our findings on pzn-@xmath11pt and pmn-@xmath11pt relaxor systems using neutron and x - ray scattering . the anomalous behavior of various long - range polar order",
    "/ lattice structures will be discussed first , followed by diffuse scattering measurements on pnr .",
    "these results show that local disorder due to frustration is responsible for many special properties of relaxor systems and it is extremely important to obtain a better understanding of these local inhomogeneities and how they interact / affect the bulk .",
    "the concept of phase `` x '' was first raised by ohwada _",
    "et al . _ in their work on structural properties of pzn-8%pt  @xcite . a near cubic phase , instead of the rhombohedral phase according to previously known phase diagrams ,",
    "was discovered upon zero - field - cooling ( zfc ) .",
    "more definitive evidence of this phase `` x '' was found in unpoled single crystals of pzn  @xcite . using high energy x - ray ( 67  kev )",
    ", we were able to probe deeply inside the bulk pzn single crystal and look for the rhombohedral distortion at room temperature ( t@xmath10  k for pzn ) . in a rhombohedrally distorted lattice ,",
    "the d - spacings of four \\{111 } planes become different .",
    "we have therefore performed mesh scans around the four \\{111 } bragg peaks .",
    "the results obtained from the prepoled ( field cooling to room temperature with e=20  kv / cm along [ 111 ] direction ) and unpoled pzn single crystals are clearly different . for the poled crystal , bragg peaks at ( 111 ) and ( @xmath1311 )",
    "appear at different * q * lengths due to the rhombohedral distortion ( see fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "the rhombohedral angle obtained from the measurements is @xmath14 , consistent with previous reports  @xcite .",
    "however , the four mesh scans for the unpoled pzn single crystal all give the same d - spacing at t=300  k ( see the bottom frame of fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) , showing no evidence of rhombohedral distortion .",
    "this near cubic low temperature phase was later also discovered in pmn-10%pt  @xcite and pmn-20%pt  @xcite . unlike the case in pure pmn where the low temperature phase under zfc is really cubic",
    ", the symmetry of phase `` x '' is likely not cubic , evidenced by the increase of bragg peak intensities at t@xmath15 due to release of extinction  @xcite - which is usually a sign of transition into a lower symmetry phase .",
    "there are other signs suggesting that even the unit cell does not show a ( detectable ) rhombohedral distortion , a structural phase transition has indeed occurred at t@xmath15 .",
    "for example , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , a sudden increase of lattice strain along the [ 110 ] direction occurs at t@xmath16  k for pmn-20%pt by high @xmath17-resolution neutron scattering measurements  @xcite .",
    "similar effect has been observed in pure pzn with high energy x - ray diffraction measurements as well  @xcite . there in addition to the change of lattice strain , a broadening of the ( 200 ) bragg peak in the transverse direction has also been observed , indicating a sudden increase of crystal mosaic at t@xmath18  k.    the lack of lattice distortion in phase `` x '' is quite unusual .",
    "our current understanding of phase `` x '' is that this is a phase where the lattice prefers to go rhombohedral because of the tendency toward a long - range ordered ferroelectric phase below t@xmath15 .",
    "ferroelectric polarizations are actually realized by local atomic displacements .",
    "however , the unit cell shape still remains nearly cubic . in other words , this can also be called a `` less - rhombohedral '' phase where the unit cell distortion is much smaller than one would expect .",
    "the large strain in this phase is an indication of structural inhomogeneity .",
    "it is our belief that the interactions between local inhomogeneities - possibly the pnr - and the bulk lattice , become strong enough and `` locks '' the long - range lattice structure into this unusual configuration of phase `` x '' .",
    "the phase itself is quite unstable and can be easily driven into a full rhombohedral phase with an external field along [ 111 ] direction .",
    "the discovery of phase `` x '' was actually accompanied with the discovery of another interesting effect - the `` skin effect '' .",
    "the findings of a near cubic phase inside the bulk of pzn ( and later pmn-10%pt and pmn-20%pt ) single crystals are surprising and not consistent with previous results  @xcite . in order to resolve the inconsistency ,",
    "measurements probing different depths into the single crystal sample have been carried out . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , longitudinal intensity profiles near the ( 111 ) bragg peak of the same single crystal pzn using x - ray diffraction with different x - ray energies are shown . with 67  kev x - rays ,",
    "the intensity profile shows a sharp single peak for temperatures both above and below t@xmath19k , i.e. no rhombohedral splitting for the low temperature phase .",
    "with x - ray energy of 10.7  kev , the situation is drastically different .",
    "the profile only has one peak in the high temperature cubic phase ; while at low temperature , the ( 111 ) bragg peak splits into two .",
    "the answer to the different results lies in the penetration depth of photons into the sample . for 67  kev x - rays , the x - ray penetration depth into the sample",
    "( the sample geometry is already taken into consideration ) is about 400  @xmath20 m , and the measurements are performed in a transmission mode . in other words , the bulk of the sample is being measured and a near cubic phase ( phase `` x '' ) is observed . for 10.7  kev x - rays ,",
    "the penetration depth is much smaller ( @xmath21 m ) and the measurements had to be performed in a reflection mode since x - rays can not penetrate the sample which has a thickness of about 1  mm .",
    "therefore , the rhombohedral distortion is actually only limited to a outer - most layer , or `` skin '' in the sample .",
    "based on the penetration lengths of the x - ray beams , we can obtain an estimate of thickness of the outer - layer to be between 10  @xmath20 m and 100  @xmath20 m .",
    "in addition to having different lattice structures , the thermal expansion of the outer - layer and the inside can also be quite different . in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , the lattice parameters of the inside and outer - layer of the unpoled pzn single crystal are plotted .",
    "the behavior of the outer - layer is what one would expect from a normal ferroelectric oxide  @xcite .",
    "the inside of the crystal however , behaves quite differently .",
    "the lattice parameter almost remains constant for the whole temperature range , not being affected by the phase transition at t@xmath10  k. similar results is also seen in pmn-20%pt ( see the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "this is another important feature of phase `` x '' which differs from a normal ferroelectric phase .",
    "the `` skin - effect '' naturally explains the discrepancy between recent high - energy x - ray and neutron diffraction measurements on single crystal relaxor samples  @xcite and previous work where the rhombohedral distortion can be measured from the samples of similar compositions  @xcite . in previous work , either a lab x - ray source and/or powder samples were used .",
    "a lab x - ray source usually gives photons at the energy of cu k@xmath22 line ( @xmath23  kev ) which can only penetrate into the outer most @xmath21 m of these lead based relaxor samples .",
    "when powder samples are used , the normal grain sizes would also be in the order of tens of @xmath20 m , the same as the thickness of the outer layer .",
    "it is for this reason that powder and/or lab x - ray measurements only probes the outer - layer but not the inside of the crystal .",
    "the `` skin - effect '' is not limited to compositions where phase `` x '' exists ( in the bulk ) .",
    "it has also been observed in systems with a rhombohedral lattice structure for the bulk part of the crystal .",
    "for example , in pzn-4.5%pt and pzn-8%pt single crystal samples , high energy x - ray measurements confirm that the inside of the crystals are rhombohedrally distorted  @xcite .",
    "the structures obtained with lower energy x - ray ( 10.7  kev ) measurements are also rhombohedral , but the lattice parameter and rhombohedral angles between the outer region and the inside are different .",
    "the outer layers have larger rhombohedral distortions ( rhombohedral angles further away from 90@xmath24 ) and smaller lattice parameters  @xcite .",
    "these results provide more evidence that the strain inside the crystal - most likely due to interaction between the lattice that tends to become polar and the pnr - is the key that prevents or reduces the rhombohedral distortion .",
    "when going near the surface , the strain is reduced - which is probably the opposite to many other systems where surface strains can actually affect surface properties , and the rhombohedral distortion is restored .",
    "interestingly , the `` skin effect '' is also present in pure pmn , which is believed to be an exception to pzn-@xmath11pt and pmn-@xmath11pt systems since it always remains cubic with zfc .",
    "et al . _ have performed strain measurements using a very narrow neutron beam  @xcite on a single crystal pmn sample .",
    "the sample can be translated so that one can use the narrow beam to directly probe the lattice structures of different depths into the sample . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] , similar to what has been observed in pzn-@xmath11pt samples , in pure pmn there is an outer - layer of about @xmath25 m thick near the surface with lattice strain significantly smaller than that of the inside .",
    "the `` skin - effect '' is discussed in more details in ref .  .",
    "it is most likely that the the large strain for the inside structure is associated with the pnr and is unique for relaxor compounds .",
    "in addition , with a different `` outer - layer '' structure , it is important for one to be extra careful when interpreting measurements that may only probe the surface region of these materials .",
    "another important finding in the research on structural properties of relaxor materials is the discovery of monoclinic phases . in pzn-@xmath11pt and pmn-@xmath11pt systems , monoclinic ( m )",
    "phases were first discovered experimentally  @xcite for compositions near the morphortropic phase boundary ( mpb ) that separates the rhombohedral relaxor and the tetragonal ferroelectric phases ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the m phases are also predicted by theoretical works - while the original devonshire theory to the sixth - order only supports rhombohedral ( r ) , tetragonal ( t ) and orthorhombic ( o ) phases , a further expansion of the theory to the eighth - order  @xcite does predict three different monoclinic phases , m@xmath26 , m@xmath27 , and m@xmath15 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ) . compared to the low pt doping r phase , where the polarization is confined to the [ 111 ] direction ; and the high pt doping t phase , where the polarization is confined to the [ 001 ] direction ; in the m phases the polarizations are confined in plane  @xcite - ( 1@xmath130 ) plane for m@xmath26 and m@xmath27 phases [ see fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ( a ) ] , and ( 010 ) plane for m@xmath15 phases [ see fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ( b ) ] .",
    "as the polarization is rotated away from [ 111 ] toward [ 001 ] with higher pt doping , these m phases act as bridging phases where the polarizations lie in between r and t.    the situation is similar when an external field along [ 001 ] direction is applied . for compositions on the left side of the mpb with rhombohedral ground state , the polarization",
    "can then be rotated by the field toward the [ 001 ] direction , inducing intermediate monoclinic phases .",
    "this is the `` polarization rotation mechanism '' proposed by fu and cohen  @xcite to explain the enhanced piezoelectric response near the mpb . a smooth rotation from r ( [ 111 ] ) to t ( [ 001 ] )",
    "would give a m@xmath26 phase , while with higher field , a jump to the m@xmath15 phase can also occur .",
    "experimental evidence on field induced m phases have been reported by various neutron and x - ray diffraction measurements on a number of compositions of pzn-@xmath11pt  @xcite and pmn-@xmath11pt  @xcite samples .",
    "the m@xmath27 phase can only be induced with an external field along the [ 011 ] ( orthorhombic ) direction  @xcite , as the m@xmath27 phase can be considered as a bridge between r and o [ see fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ( a ) ] .",
    "one dilemma still remains , however .",
    "intuitively , as shown in fig .  [ fig:7 ] , the bridge phase between r and t should be m@xmath26 .",
    "while in reality , in both pzn-@xmath11pt and pmn-@xmath11pt systems , only m@xmath15 phase has been observed between the r and t regions without external electric field ( in pzn-@xmath11pt systems , the zero field orthorhombic ( o ) phase is a special case of m@xmath15 phase ) .",
    "this can not be easily explained by only looking at the long - range structures .",
    "in fact , by the end of the next section , i will discuss a possible explanation to this problem considering strain induced by polar nano - regions and its implications .",
    "the concept of polar nano - regions is unique to relaxor systems , where local polar orders appear before any long - range polar order is established in the system .",
    "since these pnr represent local structures different from the average lattice , diffuse scattering is one of the most direct tools to probe inside the bulk for these inhomogeneities . in general ,",
    "diffuse scatterings from pzn-@xmath11pt and pmn-@xmath11pt samples with compositions on the left side of the mpb are very similar  @xcite .",
    "they appear above t@xmath15 , and increase monotonically with cooling . the distribution of diffuse scattering intensities in the reciprocal space has also been measured for different compositions ( with small @xmath11 ) .",
    "an example of these measurements is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] . here",
    "a mesh scan from neutron diffuse scattering measurements taken at 200  k from a single crystal pmn , around the ( 100 ) bragg peak in the ( h0l ) plane is plotted .",
    "the intensity is highly anisotropic in the reciprocal space , taking a `` butterfly '' shape in the ( h0l ) plane .",
    "measurements have also been taken on the right side of the mpb  @xcite and the `` butterfly '' diffuse scattering disappears , indicating that no pnr exists in the ferroelectric side of the phase diagram .",
    "more detailed measurements probing the three - dimensional ( 3-d ) distribution of diffuse scattering intensities  @xcite using high energy x - ray beam were performed on single crystals of pzn-@xmath11pt for x=0 , 4.5% and 8% .",
    "it was found that the diffuse scattering is dominated by rod type intensities along various @xmath28 directions .",
    "although there are totally six different @xmath28 rods , they do not always show up with the same intensity across different bragg peaks .",
    "a sketch of the intensity distribution in the 3-d reciprocal space is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] . based on how these @xmath28 intensity rods changes",
    ", we propose that they come from independent local structures .",
    "in other words , the diffuse rod along each @xmath28 direction comes from pnr of a certain orientation .",
    "then the problem becomes relatively simple . since rod type intensities in reciprocal space must correspond to planar correlations / structures in real space",
    ", we can conclude that the short - range polar order in the pnr must take a planar shape in real space .",
    "the polarization of these pnr can then be derived from analyzing the `` extinction condition '' where some @xmath28 rods becomes absent near certain bragg peaks .",
    "a simple model called the `` pancake model '' ( see fig .  [ fig:10 ] ) shows that the there are six possible orientations / polarizations of pnr , with @xmath29 type polarizations , correlated in \\{110 } planes , that give rise to @xmath28 diffuse rods .",
    "the in - plane and out - of - plane correlation lengths ( or , the diameter and thickness of the `` pancake '' pnr , respectively ) can be estimated from the broadness of diffuse scattering perpendicular and along the intensity rod directions .",
    "a rough estimate will give a in - plane correlation length of 10 to 20  nm ( 20 to 40 lattice spacings ) while the out - of - plane correlation length is about four times smaller  @xcite .",
    "the `` pancake model '' is a simplified model .",
    "for example , in this model , the atomic displacements within the pnr are assumed to be all collinear , along the same direction .",
    "the possibility of more than a single source to the diffuse scattering is also not considered ( e.g. it is possible that the diffuse scattering comes from combination of a polar core plus surrounding lattice strain induced by the core ) . however , it does provide some important information for the local structures in these relaxor systems . using this model , most previous diffuse scattering measurements on these systems can be easily explained - for instance , the `` butterfly '' intensity around ( 100 ) peak in the ( h0l ) plane is simply the cross - section of the [ 110 ] and [ 1@xmath130 ] intensity rods on the ( h0l ) plane .",
    "in addition , it is found that the polarizations / local atomic displacements in the pnr are not along the rhombohedral @xmath30 directions as previously believed .",
    "this suggests that the pnr are not simply precursors of the macroscopic ferroelectric domains with @xmath30 polarizations in the low temperature phase . instead",
    ", the pnr still persist into the low temperature .",
    "quantitative studies on diffuse scattering intensities across different bragg peaks  @xcite can be used to obtain the magnitude of atomic displacements within a unit cell .",
    "it is shown that in both pure pmn and pzn-@xmath11pt crystals , the local atomic shifts in the pnr responsible for the diffuse scattering are always composed of two components : one optic component which gives rise to local polarizations ; and one acoustic component , which is related to strains in the system .",
    "the former is always expected since these are `` polar '' structures , and is likely due to the condensation of the ferroelectric transverse optic phonon , which softens significantly below t@xmath12  @xcite .",
    "having also the acoustic component is surprising but it helps explain the large strain in these lead - based relaxor systems . the interaction between the pnr and the bulk lattice is a clear example of frustration between lattice strain and charge suppressing / reducing long - range polar order in the system .      because of their `` polar '' nature , one would expect the pnr to respond to the application of an external electric field .",
    "indeed , previous studies  @xcite have shown that neutron diffuse scattering measured in transverse directions to the bragg vectors can be partially suppressed .",
    "intuitively , if an external electric field can enhance the long - range polar order in the lattice , it should also be able to suppress the short - range polar order in the pnr . since pzn-@xmath11pt and pmn-@xmath11pt relaxors with small @xmath11 values all",
    "have rhombohedral type ground states with [ 111 ] lattice polarization , we have designed more experiments monitoring the 2-d and 3-d diffuse scattering intensity distribution under an electric field applied along the [ 111 ] direction . in fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] , diffuse scattering intensities from a single crystal sample of pzn-8%pt ( t@xmath31  k ) are plotted  @xcite .",
    "the measurements have been carried out in the ( hkk ) plane which is defined by the two vectors along [ 100 ] and [ 011 ] .",
    "the cross - section of the @xmath28 diffuse scattering rods on this plane also takes a `` butterfly '' shape , as shown by the zero field cooled ( zfc ) measurements plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] ( a ) . with the application of e=2",
    "kv / cm along [ 111 ] and doing fc , surprisingly , even when the long - range rhombohedral structure is stabilized below t@xmath15 , the diffuse scattering still persists . the symmetric `` butterfly '' shape , however , is changed to an asymmetric `` butterfly '' as shown in fig .  [ fig:11 ]",
    "( b ) , suggesting a redistribution of diffuse scattering intensities between different `` butterfly '' wings .",
    "apparently , the pnr in pzn-8%pt do not simply diminish with the external e - field along [ 111 ] . instead , there appears to be a redistribution of pnr with different polarizations .    the [ 111 ] e - field redistribution of pnr",
    "is studied in more details and confirmed with 3-d x - ray diffuse scattering measurements on the single crystal of pzn  @xcite .",
    "it is found that with the field greater than a threshhold field , the diffuse scattering intensities can be redistributed among the six different @xmath28 rods .",
    "those ( 3 out of 6 ) diffuse rods coming from pnr with polarizations perpendicular to the e - field are enhanced , while the other 3 are suppressed .",
    "increasing the magnitude of the e - field does not have any further effect on the diffuse scattering . reducing and eventually reversing the field , however , results in a hysteresis loop very similar to that measured for the polarization vs. e loop on the same single crystal pzn sample .",
    "these results show that cooling in an e - field , and the application of a large enough e - field along [ 111 ] direction in the low temperature ferroelectric ( r ) phase , both induce a redistribution of pnr with different polarizations . instead of suppressing the pnr or aligning their polarizations to be more along the field direction",
    ", the field seems to enhance those pnr with polarizations perpendicular to the [ 111 ] direction .",
    "this is quite contrary to what one would naturally expect since the energy of the pnr ( dipole moments ) alone in the electric field does not favor such a configuration . on the other hand ,",
    "the similarities between the field dependence of diffuse scattering intensities and that of the polarization  @xcite suggest that this redistribution of pnr is likely associated with the rotation of ferroelectric domains by the field . in the paraelectric high temperature phase",
    ", there is no long - range ferroelectric domains , and pnr with different @xmath28 polarizations are equivalent under the cubic symmetry .",
    "when the system goes into the low temperature phase , long - range polar order is established and ferroelectric domains with @xmath30 polarizations are formed . within these domains ,",
    "the symmetry is lowered to r , and the different @xmath28 directions are not equivalent any more . if , within a certain ferroelectric domain , the pnr would prefer to exist in a configuration where their polarizations are perpendicular to that of the domain , all our previous results can be explained easily . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:13 ]  ( b ) , under zfc , after multi - domain averaging , in the crystal there is no macroscopic preferred @xmath28 polarization of the pnr , resulting in the symmetric `` butterfly '' diffuse scattering shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:8 ] , [ fig:9 ] , and [ fig:11 ]  ( a ) .",
    "however , with fc , the volume of the ferroelectric domain polarized along the field [ 111 ] direction is greatly enhanced [ see fig .  [ fig:13 ]  ( c ) ] , and our measurements thus provide direct information on how the pnr reside in a [ 111 ] polarized ferroelectric lattice - they tend to have polarizations perpendicular to that of their surrounding lattice .    the case for pure pmn",
    "is an exception .",
    "once an external electric field along [ 111 ] direction is applied , in addition to the redistribution of diffuse scattering intensities between different @xmath28 directions , there is also an overall suppression of the diffuse scattering by the field  @xcite . in the mean time ,",
    "bragg peak intensities increase , indicating an enhancement of long - range order in the system .",
    "note that in pure pmn , no long - range polar order is established without external field and therefore no macroscopic ferroelectric domains exist at low temperature",
    ". however , there could be polar - orders developing in the system at low temperature in the mesoscopic range ( e.g. @xmath32 m ) that provides local @xmath30 polarized lattice environment for the pnr . with an external electric field",
    ", the re - arrangements of these mesoscopic polar lattice can give rise to the redistribution of pnr and therefore diffuse scattering .",
    "on the other hand , not having a long - range ferroelectric order seems to also make the short - range polar order in the pnr less stable and more sensitive to external fields .",
    "this situation where the two competing orders can co - exist , and having the long - range order helps stabilizing the short - range polar order , is quite unusual .",
    "in addition , as the temperature decreases , both orders will develop ( with the exception of pure pmn ) - the long - range polar order develops as evidenced by the increase of rhombohedral distortion with cooling ; and the short - range order develops shown by the increase of diffuse scattering intensities .",
    "even an external electric field along [ 111 ] direction can not change this configuration .",
    "instead , the [ 111 ] e - field only re - arranges the ferroelectric domains and removes the ambiguity caused by a multi - domain state .",
    "the robustness of these local polar orders within the long - range polarized lattice is yet another indication of charge - lattice frustration in relaxor systems .",
    "in addition to learning how the pnr exist in relaxor systems as discussed in the previous two subsections , a more important question is that how they affect bulk properties . as discussed before , the long - range lattice structure are affected by the pnr , showing large strains and other anomalous behaviors  @xcite .",
    "in addition to static long - range structures , the pnr also affect the lattice dynamics in pzn-@xmath11pt and pmn-@xmath11pt relaxor systems .    in ordinary ferroelectrics ,",
    "there is usually a transverse optic phonon ( to ) mode that is associated with the phase transition .",
    "the to mode softens and the zone - center energy goes toward zero at t@xmath15  @xcite . in relaxors a similar softening of the ferroelectric to mode is also observed at high temperature , but this mode becomes anomalously broad for small @xmath17 values in a large temperature range , between the burns temperature t@xmath12 and the curie temperate t@xmath15 . with further cooling ,",
    "the to mode recovers again below t@xmath15 .",
    "this is called the `` water - fall '' effect , and has been observed in both pure pmn and pzn , as well as a number of compositions of pzn-@xmath11pt and pmn-@xmath11pt on the left side of the phase diagram  @xcite . because of the temperature range it is observed , and the belief that the pnr are results of to phonon condensations , the `` water - fall '' effect has been interpreted as a result of interactions between the pnr and the to phonon mode . however , in recent work by stock _",
    "et al . _ on a single crystal pmn-60%pt sample , the zone - center to mode was also found to become heavily damped in a broad temperature range , just like the `` water - fall '' effect observed in relaxors .",
    "note that pmn-60%pt is located on the right side of the pt doping phase diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , with a first - order phase transition from cubic to tetragonal at t@xmath33  k  @xcite .",
    "there is also no `` butterfly '' shaped diffuse scattering from this material .",
    "having a `` water - fall '' effect in this ferroelectric material with the absence of pnr suggests that the `` water - fall '' effect could have other origins .",
    "although the coupling between pnr and the soft to phonon mode is becoming controversial , there appears to be strong evidence suggesting that the pnr interact strongly with transverse acoustic ( ta ) phonon modes in these relaxor systems .",
    "neutron scattering measurements were performed on lattice dynamics and diffuse scattering in different brillouin zones from single crystal pmn  @xcite .",
    "a strong influence of the diffuse component was observed on ta phonons in the system . in another experiment carried out on a single crystal sample of pzn-4.5%pt",
    ", we have used an external e - field along [ 111 ] direction to help demonstrate the coupling  @xcite .",
    "the schematic of the measurements is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:14 ] ( a ) .",
    "phonon and diffuse scattering measurements are performed around ( 220 ) and ( @xmath3420 ) bragg peaks .",
    "these two peaks are equivalent in the cubic phase . in the low temperature rhombohedral phase , with zfc",
    ", they should also give similar results due to multidomain averaging .",
    "with fc for e along [ 111 ] direction , the two bragg peaks become different .",
    "the diffuse scattering intensity is enhanced near ( @xmath3420 ) and suppressed near ( 220 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:14 ] ( b ) .",
    "the transverse acoustic phonon mode measured across the two bragg peaks are clearly affected .",
    "near ( @xmath3420 ) where diffuse scattering is strong , the ta mode becomes very soft and heavily damped . near ( 220 ) where diffuse scattering is weak",
    ", the ta mode becomes relatively well defined .",
    "these results suggest that there is a strong coupling between the diffuse scattering and ta phonon modes propagating along different @xmath28 directions ( the ta2 mode ) .",
    "the interaction with the pnr makes the ta2 mode particularly soft .",
    "this marks a structural instability in the system , which is necessary for a system with high piezoelectric response  @xcite .",
    "in other words , the coupling between pnr and acoustic phonons may be related to the high electromechanical properties of pzn-@xmath11pt and pmn-@xmath11pt systems .",
    "furthermore , the soft ta2 mode propagating along @xmath28 directions suggest a tendency toward a orthorhombic ( o ) phase , which in a sense is the dynamical response of the lattice to the orthorhombic type @xmath28 strain in the pnr",
    ". this orthorhombic strain can help explain the dilemma raised in section  [ dilemma ] : although the only direct bridging phase between r and t is m@xmath26 , in reality only m@xmath15 phases exist in zfc pzn-@xmath11pt and pmn-@xmath11pt ? !",
    "while compositions on the low pt doping side of the phase diagram is supposed to have r type structures , the presence of pnr induces orthorhombic strains in the system . to bridge structures with orthorhombic strains which are on the left side of the phase diagram , and those with tetragonal strain , on the right side of the phase diagram ,",
    "a m@xmath15 phase is a natural choice  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ) .",
    "our neutron and x - ray scattering studies on pzn-@xmath11pt and pmn-@xmath11pt relaxor compounds have shown that these materials have complex local structures due to lattice - charge frustration .",
    "the short - range polar orders , namely , the polar nano - regions ( pnr ) can affect the long - range polar order in various ways . they can reduce or even suppress the long - range polar order ( phase `` x '' ) , and induce large lattice strains .",
    "the pnr also interact strongly with acoustic phonon modes , and therefore create a phase instability that may be related to the high piezoelectric response in these materials . on the other hand",
    ", the short- and long - range polar orders can still coexist in most of the compositions studied , and there are even implications that the long - range order can help make the short - range polar order more stable .",
    "these complex local structures are far from being fully understood .",
    "currently there are many unanswered questions , and unsolved problems . here",
    "i list a few related topics that would be of interest for future studies :    \\(i ) _ the origin of the pnr . _",
    "as discussed in earlier parts of the article , the relaxor properties in pzn-@xmath11pt and pmn-@xmath11pt systems are related to the random field created by the b - site disorder .",
    "short - range polar order , or the pnr , develops at the burns temperature t@xmath12 as a result of frustration in the system .",
    "it is therefore natural to consider the relationship between the pnr and the short - range chemical / cation order in the system .",
    "there have been theoretical considerations for this aspect  @xcite , as well as hints from experimental results  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig:15 ] , we show diffuse scattering intensity contours below and above t@xmath12 from pmn .",
    "one can see that at t above t@xmath12 , where the `` butterfly '' diffuse scattering already disappears , there is still a weak residue diffuse scattering intensity around both the ( 110 ) and ( 100 ) bragg peaks .",
    "the residue diffuse scattering intensity does not change much with temperature and should be due to a short - range chemical ordering .",
    "what is interesting about the results is that this residue diffuse has shapes that seem to be a conjugate to that of the `` butterfly '' diffuse from the pnr .",
    "this may be a simple coincidence but could also be a hint that those two are related .",
    "further studies are clearly required to clarify this problem .",
    "in fact , there has been work done on another lead perovskite system pb(in@xmath35nb@xmath35)o@xmath2 ( pin ) where the b - site disorder can be tuned  @xcite . by increasing the chemical order on the b - site , one is able to tune the system toward a more relaxor type phase with pnr present  @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) _ how do the pnr respond to e - field along other directions ?",
    "_ the response of pnr for e - field along [ 111 ] direction as been extensively studied . however , very little work has yet been done on the response of diffuse scattering to e - field along other high symmetry directions such as [ 001 ] and [ 110 ] .",
    "preliminary work  @xcite has indicated that an [ 001 ] field does not directly affect the `` butterfly '' diffuse .",
    "nevertheless , there are indications that diffuse scattering intensities measured along @xmath36 away from bragg peaks can be partially suppressed by the [ 001 ] e - field  @xcite .",
    "the `` butterfly '' diffuse scattering is clearly the dominant part of the diffuse scattering intensity being measured .",
    "but it is still possible , as previously mentioned , that there can be other sources to the diffuse scattering intensities than the @xmath28 type atomic shifts .",
    "these sources may contribute to a portion of the diffuse scattering intensity that behaves differently than the `` butterfly '' diffuse .",
    "this is certainly an issue that requires more attention .",
    "also as [ 001 ] and [ 110 ] are the directions along which the piezoelectric response from these relaxor systems are high , it will be interesting to understand if the pnr play any roles in facilitating the `` polarization rotation '' process under these conditions .",
    "\\(iii ) _ pnr in other relaxor systems .",
    "_ in addition to the extensively studied lead perovskite relaxors , there are other relaxor systems such as the lead - free relaxor k@xmath37li@xmath38tao@xmath2 ( klt ) . in klt , instead of the b - site disorder , it is the li displacements that induces local polarization .",
    "it would be extremely interesting to explore the properties and response of pnr in this and other materials where he underlying mechanism of having the pnr is completely different .",
