    "we write the hamiltonian of the a+1 system in the form :    @xmath4    the first term describes the motion of a particle in an average potential @xmath5 created by the particles in the core : @xmath6 the core hamiltonian is a sum of single - particle hamiltonians @xmath7 and two - body residual interactions @xmath8 : @xmath9 the last term of @xmath10 is a sum of interactions between the odd particle and the core particles : @xmath11    the physical spectrum of @xmath12 consists of a small number of bound states @xmath13 and a continuum of scattering states @xmath14 which form altogether a complete , orthogonal basis .",
    "the projection operator method consists in introducing another complete set of orthogonal basis states which is a direct sum of two complementary subsets , a first subset of discrete , orthonormal states @xmath15 which span the single - particle @xmath16 space and a second subset of @xmath17 continuum states spanning the complementary @xmath18 space",

    "we denote by @xmath24 and @xmath25 the energies and creation operators of these rpa states which describe core excitations .",
    "if @xmath26 represents the rpa ground state of the core , the properties of the ( a+1)-nucleus except for its nucleon decay properties can be described in terms of the one - particle states @xmath27 and one - particle - plus - phonon states @xmath28 \\mid 0 > $ ] .",

    "the distribution of @xmath36 represents the strength function from which one can deduce the spectroscopic factors@xcite .    to allow for nucleons to decay",
    "it is necessary to introduce state vectors where the odd particle has a non - zero probability of being at infinity .",

    "the direct sum of q space and p space is by construction the complete particle - plus - phonon space in which the hamiltonian @xmath10 should be solved .",
    "it is completely equivalent to solve in the simpler q space the more complicated effective hamiltonian :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the projection operator onto p space ( @xmath40 ) and @xmath41 is the energy of the system .",

    ", the @xmath47 states will act as doorway states .",
    "if we describe the reaction mechanism in a simple approach , e.g. , a distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) , we can write down the scattering amplitude from an initial channel @xmath48 where the target @xmath49 is in its ground state @xmath50 to a final channel @xmath51 where the residual nucleus is left in some excited state @xmath52 with excitation energy @xmath24 while the escaping proton has an energy @xmath53 . using the complex bi - orthogonal basis @xmath54 , we have :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the interaction inducing the particle transfer from @xmath57 to @xmath49 , @xmath58 is an incoming wave of @xmath59 space at energy @xmath53 , and the sum over @xmath60 is restricted by the angular momenta and parities of states @xmath47 and @xmath61 .",
    "the case where the final channel is the ground state of the residual nucleus corresponds to the above expression with @xmath62 .",
    "the nucleon - transfer matrix element @xmath63 is proportional to the one - quasiparticle amplitude of the state @xmath47 . in analogy with the amplitude @xmath64 of eq.([f5 ] ) , we denote it by @xmath65 .",
    "we also introduce the partial escape amplitudes of state @xmath47 to channel @xmath61 :    @xmath66    the partial widths are : @xmath67    to obtain an expression for the cross section simple enough to lend itself to a discussion in terms of escape widths , let us assume furthermore that interference terms between different doorway states can be neglected .",
    "the density of @xmath68 states is large , and for each interval centered around @xmath41 and containing @xmath69 states we define locally averaged quantities : @xmath70 then , one can rewrite the cross sections in the following form : @xmath71 the branching ratios can be calculated by the following formula : @xmath72      the above formalism is applied to study the semi - direct proton decay of the nuclei @xmath0sc , @xmath1cu and @xmath2nb with the aim of comparing the predictions with existing data from exclusive measurements .",
    "although the qpm model soloviev et al.@xcite is not fully consistent since the residual interaction between quasiparticles is not derived from the quasiparticle mean field , it has the advantage that its two - body residual interaction is chosen of a multipole - multipole separable form and therefore , it enables one to work with configuration spaces of large dimensions without facing the cumbersome problem of diagonalizing large matrices .",
    "this is very important for the results to be meaningful as it was already shown in a previous work on neutron emission@xcite .",
    "the mean potentials entering the single - particle hamiltonians @xmath7 are of woods - saxon form .",
    "their parameters are chosen according to refs.@xcite with some readjustments such that , once the coupling to phonons is included , the ground states are located at their respective experimental positions with respect to the proton separation threshold .",
    "the qpm hamiltonian includes the monopole pairing which must be taken into account for nuclei with open shells@xcite .",
    "this is the case when we calculate the core properties of @xmath1cu and @xmath2nb .    the residual particle - hole interaction of eq . ( [ f2b ] )",
    "is taken of a separable form in coordinate space with effective interaction strengths considered as adjustable parameters .",
    "for the radial interaction form factor we have used @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the central part of the woods - saxon potential . for each excitation mode of the even - even core",
    "corresponding to a given angular momentum , parity and isospin , the interaction strength is found by requiring that the lowest collective state calculated in rpa be at the experimental energy .",
    "these interaction strengths are also used for the quasiparticle - phonon coupling .",
    "we have modified the single - particle proton spectrum for @xmath2nb in comparison with ref.@xcite to get a better description of high - lying @xmath75 , @xmath76 subshells , but so far as energies of levels near the fermi surface are practically the same there are no changes in the properties of low - lying vibrational states in comparison with those of ref.@xcite .",
    "for example , the calculated b(e@xmath77 ) values of the first low - lying collective states @xmath78 , @xmath79 in @xmath80ca are b(e3)=1.36@xmath81 , b(e5)=2.67@xmath82 that can be compared with the corresponding experimental values 1.24@xmath81 and 2.97@xmath82 . for all nuclei under consideration the calculated values of b(e@xmath77 ) are in general agreement with experiment . in the present model ,",
    "these low - lying phonons of the core are the physical channels where the initial state in the excited odd - a nucleus can decay by semi - direct proton emission . in the actual calculation , a very large number of rpa phonons are included in the quasiparticle - phonon basis , but for @xmath80ca the first quadrupole state can not be treated as a one - phonon or particle - hole state and it is outside the present model . on the other hand , the experimental data @xcite show that the proton decay of @xmath0sc to the @xmath83 state in @xmath80ca is very weak .    at high excitation energies ,",
    "when the level density becomes large , it is often more convenient to calculate the strength function @xcite instead of solving the secular equations ( [ f10 ] ) .",
    "one defines the strength function @xmath84 as the strength distribution @xmath85 folded with an averaging function @xmath86 : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is usually chosen as a breit - wigner function , @xmath89 .",
    "it is shown in ref.@xcite that the calculation of the strength function @xmath84 can be done without the detailed knowledge of the amplitudes @xmath90 .",
    "the same averaging procedure can be applied to calculate the partial escape widths and the branching ratios . in all calculations performed in this work",
    "we have adopted the value @xmath91 = 0.1 mev .",
    "using the methods presented above we have calculated the cross sections and branching ratios for the non - statistical proton decay of high - lying states with high angular momenta in @xmath0sc , @xmath1cu and @xmath2nb going to the ground and low - lying collective states of @xmath80ca , @xmath92ni and @xmath93zr , respectively .",
    "an example of cross section calculations by the strength function method is shown in fig . 1 for the case of proton decay of the @xmath94 states in @xmath0sc .",
    "since the calculated cross section is proportional to the square of the one quasiparticle amplitude of the wave function this figure enables one to see the @xmath95 strength distribution in @xmath0sc , too .",
    "the @xmath95 strength is distributed over a broad energy interval due to the coupling with the collective vibrations .",
    "results of our calculations for the @xmath95 proton particle strength and experimental data obtained from the @xmath80ca(@xmath96he , dp ) reaction at @xmath97=240 mev@xcite are presented in table 1 .",
    "it is seen from this table that the calculations reproduce reasonably well the integral characteristics of the @xmath95 proton strength distribution in @xmath0sc .",
    "the partial contributions of the non - statistical proton decay into the ground state and @xmath78 , @xmath79 states of @xmath80ca are presented in fig .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "2 that the partial cross sections are very energy dependent and as a result different channels can dominate at some excitation energies .",
    "the solid curve in fig .",
    "1 presents the sum of all 3 partial channels .",
    "as one can see from fig . 2 at excitation energies below 8.4 mev the ground state channel dominates ,",
    "but there are strong transitions to the @xmath79 state at 7.5 and 8.0 mev .",
    "the @xmath78 and @xmath79 channels begin to contribute importantly starting from 8.4 mev and they become the main contributors after 9.5 mev .    the sum of partial widths for different channels in some energy intervals are given in table 2 .",
    "as one can see from table 2 for the energy interval 2.0 - 12.4 mev the proton decay to the @xmath79 state gives a contribution of about 54% and the @xmath78 channel contributes about 37% in the total sum .",
    "there is a predominance of the @xmath79 channel in comparison with the @xmath78 one in the energy interval 7.0 - 12.4 mev .",
    "such a behaviour can be understood from the structure of the decaying states and the angular momentum and energy carried away by the emitted proton .",
    "it is seen from eq .",
    "( [ w3 ] ) that the partial escape amplitude for fixed values of @xmath98 is proportional to the contribution of the quasiparticle - plus - phonon configuration made of a quasiparticle with the same @xmath98 and a phonon of the final state .",
    "the cross section depends on the square of these amplitudes summed over all @xmath98 allowed by the angular momentum coupling rules . in the case of the proton decay of the @xmath94 states at excitation energies 712 mev into the @xmath78 channel the outgoing protons",
    "carry @xmath60=(1,3/2 ) mainly whereas it is @xmath60=(1,3/2 ) and @xmath60=(1,1/2 ) for the @xmath99 channel .",
    "thus , penetration factor arguments favour the latter channel .",
    "it is well known that the strongest coupling between the single - particle states and phonons takes place for the collective phonons .",
    "that is why the coupling with the low - lying vibrations is mainly responsible of the damping of the high - lying single - particle modes and giant resonances in nuclei .",
    "this is the case for the @xmath78 and @xmath79 states in @xmath80ca . by this reason",
    "the strengths of the @xmath78 and @xmath79 channels are redistributed in a broad energy interval .",
    "the decrease of the spectroscopic strength with an increase of the excitation energy leads to a decreasing of cross sections of the channels discussed above .",
    "it is worth to mention that a very similar behaviour for the @xmath78 and @xmath79 channels for the neutron decay of the high angular momentum states in @xmath3pb also takes place @xcite .",
    "our conclusions about the role of different channels for the proton decay in @xmath0sc agree with observations made in ref.@xcite , but no separation of the direct part from the statistical one for the proton decay was done in that work . as a second example we consider the proton decay of the @xmath94 states in @xmath1cu .",
    "results of our calculations for the @xmath94 strength distribution in @xmath1cu and experimental data@xcite are presented in table 3 .",
    "the calculations reproduce correctly the strength near 7 mev and this part is mainly responsible for the proton decay . for the excitation energy interval ( 2 - 8.9 ) mev in @xmath1cu",
    "the summed ground state width is equal to 10.3 ev and this is much less than in the @xmath0sc case .",
    "an additional contribution from the 2@xmath100 channel has a summed width that is six times less than that of the ground state channel .",
    "there are no transitions to other vibrational states .",
    "this is easily understood if one looks at the structure of the states under discussion . for the @xmath101 channel",
    "the outgoing protons carry @xmath60=(4,9/2 ) and there is a suppression of such transitions due to penetration factor effects .",
    "the configurations including @xmath78 and @xmath79 states coupled with continuum are located at somewhat higher energies .",
    "this is why no proton decay can proceed to the @xmath78 and @xmath79 states in @xmath1ni .",
    "very recently , detailed experimental information about proton decay of isobaric analog states ( ias ) in @xmath2nb has been shown in ref .",
    "the ias are strongly excited by means of the @xmath93zr@xmath102@xmath2nb reaction .",
    "a sharp peak is seen at 12 mev excitation energy . around this",
    "excitation energy three ias have been observed earlier@xcite at 11.93 mev , 12.07 mev and 12.15 mev .",
    "it is shown in ref.@xcite that at 12 mev by means of @xmath102 reaction predominantly the @xmath103 state is excited .",
    "the proton decays to the ground state and some low - lying states are observed .",
    "the partial differential cross sections for each final state are given .",
    "the data reveal proton decays predominantly to @xmath104 and @xmath105 excited states of @xmath93zr .",
    "experimental data@xcite for energies and spectroscopic factors of ias and results of our calculations are given in table 4 .",
    "besides , this table also contains calculated partial widths for the proton decay of three ias to the ground , 2@xmath106 , 3@xmath107 , 4@xmath106 and 5@xmath107 states",
    ".    as one can see from table 4 the calculated excitation energies for the @xmath108 ias are higher than the experimental ones but the spectroscopic factors extracted from experimental data within 20% accuracy are reproduced reasonably well .",
    "let us discuss the proton partial widths for these ias .",
    "it is seen from table 4 that for the first @xmath108 state the main decay channel is the @xmath109 channel . for this state",
    "the @xmath60=(0,1/2 ) protons are most important for the @xmath109 channel and there is a rather weak transition for the @xmath83 channel due to the @xmath60=(2,3/2 ) protons .",
    "the ground state width is proportional to the one quasiparticle strength ( the spectroscopic factor ) .",
    "since the contribution of the one quasiparticle component in the norm of the wave function of this ias is much less than contributions of the quasiparticle - plus - phonon components the transition to the ground state is weaker than to the @xmath109 .",
    "the particularities of the partial proton widths for the second @xmath108 state can be understood from the structure of this state , too . for the @xmath109 channel the @xmath60=(2,3/2),(2,5/2 ) and ( 4,7/2 )",
    "protons can contribute besides the @xmath60=(0,1/2 ) protons . as a result",
    "the decay width to the @xmath109 state increases strongly for the second @xmath108 ias in comparison with that of the first @xmath108 state .",
    "an increase of the contribution of the configuration constructed from the first quadrupole phonon and @xmath110 single - particle state in comparison with their contribution to the structure of the first @xmath108 state results in an essential growth of the decay width to the @xmath83 channel .",
    "the ground state width becomes larger mainly because of the increased spectroscopic factor .",
    "the transitions to the @xmath104 state can take place due to the outgoing protons with @xmath60=(5,11/2 ) but they are supressed because of penetration factors and a small contribution of relevant components in the wave function structure .",
    "in the case of the @xmath111 ias the @xmath112 channel dominates and this is due to the outgoing protons carrying @xmath60=(0,1/2),(2,3/2 ) and ( 2,5/2 ) .",
    "the components containing the @xmath105 phonon have a small contribution in the wave function structure and as a result the width for the @xmath105 channel is small , too . in spite of unfavourable penetration factor",
    "the @xmath83 width is 4 times larger than that of the @xmath105 channel .",
    "this is due to the configuration consisting of the @xmath113 phonon coupled with @xmath103 which contributes about 15% in the norm of the @xmath111 ias .",
    "the comparison of the calculated partial widths with the data of ref.@xcite shows that there is a qualitative agreement .",
    "the main channels of the proton decay of ( 11/2)@xmath114 ias are reproduced in the calculated structure .",
    "the dominance of the @xmath104 channel is well established and the calculated partial width of 3.3 kev ( table 4 ) is in agreement with the measured one ( 2.9 kev ) .",
    "the @xmath105 channel is more pronounced than ground state channel but the calculated partial widths for both channels are much less than the measured ones .",
    "the calculations indicate a large decay to the @xmath83 channel . such decay is discussed in ref.@xcite but quantitative estimations for the contribution of the @xmath83 channel in the cross section",
    "have not been evaluated in that work .",
    "the summed partial widths for the proton decay of the three ias to the low - lying vibrational states are also presented in table 4 . as one can see from the last row of table 4 the @xmath109 channel exhausts almost 60% of the total cross section , the @xmath104 channel contributes about 26% and the @xmath83 channel gives about 10% of the total strength .",
    "the contribution of the ground state channel for the proton decay of the three ias in @xmath2nb is 4% only .",
    "a microscopic approach based on the qpm has been applied to calculate the non - statistical proton decays of high angular momentum states excited in one - nucleon transfer reactions .",
    "partial cross sections and branching ratios for proton emission from high - lying states in @xmath0sc , @xmath1ni and @xmath2nb have been evaluated .",
    "the calculated branching ratios demonstrate the existence of strong direct proton decays to the low - lying vibrational states in @xmath0sc and @xmath2nb and enables one to understand particularities of the decay to different channels .",
    "one can conclude from an analysis of calculated partial cross sections that , for high angular momentum states the non - statistical proton decay is more favourable into the higher angular momentum and lower excitation energy final states when the two following conditions are fulfilled : a strong particle - phonon coupling in that channel and a penetration factor which is not hindered by angular momentum or energy .",
    "a similar conclusion was also reached for the neutron decay case@xcite . a general agreement with existing experimental data",
    "is obtained and the predicted branching ratios for different channels can be used to analyze future experimental data .",
