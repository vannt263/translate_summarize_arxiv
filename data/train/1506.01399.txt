    "the assumption of a supersymmetry between bosons and fermions has been found capable of addressing many key issues in particle physics and gravity ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in flat space physics",
    "an interplay between bosons and fermions can render logarithmically divergent feynman diagrams finite .",
    "similarly , an interplay between bosons and fermions can cancel the perturbative quadratic divergence that an elementary higgs scalar field would possess ( the hierarchy problem ) .",
    "in addition , the existence of fermionic supersymmetry generators allows one to evade the coleman - mandula theorem @xcite that forbids the combining of spacetime and bosonic internal symmetry generators in a common lie algebra . and",
    "with the inclusion of supersymmetry one can potentially achieve a unification of the coupling constants of @xmath1 at a grand unified energy scale . in the presence of gravity an interplay between bosons and fermions",
    "can cancel the quartic divergence in the vacuum energy .",
    "cancellation of perturbative infinities can also be found in supergravity , the local version of supersymmetry .",
    "with supersymmetry one can construct a consistent candidate quantum theory of gravity , string theory , which permits a possible unification of all of the fundamental forces and a metrication ( geometrization ) of them .",
    "finally , with supersymmetry one has a prime candidate for dark matter .    despite this quite extensive theoretical inventory , actual experimental detection of any of the required superpartners of the standard fermions and bosons",
    "has so far proven elusive .",
    "now until quite recently one could account for such non - detection by endowing the superpartners with ever higher masses or ever weaker couplings to ordinary matter .",
    "however , in order to cancel the quadratic self - energy divergence that an elementary higgs field would have , one would need a supersymmetric particle with a mass reasonably close to that of the higgs boson itself . and",
    "now that the higgs boson has been discovered at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and its 125 gev mass has now been established @xcite , one should thus anticipate finding a superparticle at the lhc in the same 125 gev mass region .",
    "however , no evidence for any such particle has emerged in an exploration of this mass region , or in decays such as @xmath2 that were thought to be particularly favorable for supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "not only was no evidence for supersymmetry found in the original lhc run 1 at a beam center of mass energy of 7 to 8 tev , at the even higher energies in the subsequent lhc run 2 at a beam center of mass energy of 13 tev , and with a far more extensive search of possible relevant channels , no sign of any superparticles up to masses quite significantly above 125 gev was found at all . and while the superparticle search at the lhc is still ongoing , and while the so far unsuccessful underground dark matter searches are continuing , nonetheless the situation is disquieting enough that one should at least contemplate whether it might be possible to dispense with supersymmetry altogether . if one is to consider doing so however , then one must seek an alternative to supersymmetry that has the potential to also achieve its key successes . in this paper",
    "we present such a candidate alternative , one that is also based on a symmetry , namely conformal symmetry .",
    "since the higgs self - energy problem is currently the most pressing concern for supersymmetry , in this paper we shall concentrate on the issue of generating the higgs boson dynamically , since one then no longer encounters the quadratic self - energy divergence problem that is associated with an elementary higgs scalar field .",
    "moreover , independent of any supersymmetry considerations , now that the higgs boson has been shown to exist , it anyway becomes imperative to ascertain whether it is elementary or composite , and determine whether or not a fundamental , double - well higgs potential is to actually be present in the fundamental action of nature . in the present paper we will show that in a conformal or scale invariant theory as realized via critical scaling with anomalous dimensions there is dynamical symmetry breaking via a fermion bilinear condensate , with a fermionic mass and dynamical higgs and goldstone particles being generated , and with the mass of the higgs boson naturally being of the same order as that of the fermion , rather than being altogether larger . moreover , if conformal symmetry is to be exact at the level of the lagrangian and to only be broken in the vacuum ( giving the dimensionful @xmath0 composite operator a vacuum expectation value would break both chiral and scale symmetry ) , the presence of any dimensionful tachyonic @xmath3 term in an elementary higgs field lagrangian would expressly be forbidden . with the dynamical higgs boson that we find being not a below - threshold bound state but a narrow resonance that lies just above the threshold in the fermion - antifermion scattering amplitude , its width could potentially be a diagnostic that could distinguish a dynamical higgs boson from an elementary one .    in order to develop the background needed to establish our results , given that our work is based on earlier work from quite some time ago , for the benefit of the reader and to make the present paper self - contained , in sec .",
    "ii we briefly review the antecedents of our current work , antecedents that originated in the work of johnson , baker , and willey @xcite and the present author @xcite on critical scaling in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) in the 1960s and 1970s . in particular , we discuss the baker - johnson @xcite evasion of the goldstone theorem in johnson - baker - willey ( jbw ) electrodynamics , wherein even though the fermion mass is self - consistently generated , it is not accompanied by a goldstone boson , with the chiral symmetry actually being broken at the level of the lagrangian by the presence of a non - zero bare @xmath4 term . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss mass generation in the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite , and in sec .",
    "iv we adapt the analysis to the jbw critical scaling case .",
    "in particular , we show that the non - chiral invariant jbw electrodynamics with its @xmath4 term is actually the mean - field approximation to a theory that is chiral invariant , namely a massless fermion qed coupled to a four - fermion interaction .",
    "in such a situation , and just as in the njl model , the mean - field possesses no goldstone boson because a mean - field sector never does .",
    "rather , it is the residual interaction that accompanies the mean field that generates a dynamical pseudoscalar goldstone bound state , one that because of the underlying chiral symmetry is accompanied by a dynamical scalar higgs boson .    in our discussion",
    "we follow @xcite and augment electrodynamics with a four - fermion interaction , one made renormalizable by a reduction in its dynamical dimension from six to four . as originally proposed by the present author this four - fermion interaction",
    "was introduced for two reasons : to cancel infinities in the vacuum ( zero - point ) energy density , infinities that one ordinarily would normal order away , and to facilitate the development of a formalism for treating symmetry breaking by fermion bilinears .",
    "( contemporaneous with the author equivalent results on symmetry breaking by composite operators were obtained by cornwall , jackiw , and tomboulis @xcite ) .",
    "the central theme of the present paper is to show that this very same four - fermion interaction also serves to provide a residual interaction that then generates the goldstone and higgs bosons that are not present in jbw electrodynamics itself .",
    "augmenting jbw electrodynamics with a four - fermion interaction thus enables us to evade the baker - johnson evasion of the goldstone theorem .",
    "now from the perspective of flat space physics there is no particular need to cancel such vacuum energy infinities since energies are not observable , only energy differences .",
    "however , once one couples to gravity one can not throw away any contribution to the vacuum energy since the hallmark of einstein s formulation of gravity is that gravity is to couple to every form of energy and not just to energy differences .",
    "thus once we extend conformal invariance to gravity , which we do , we then can not ignore infinities in the vacuum energy , and they have to be canceled .",
    "it is thus gravity that will force the four - fermion interaction ( the only choice that does not involve the introduction of fields other than those already in the qed action ) and its associated goldstone and higgs bosons upon us , and as such the four - fermion interaction would need to have its dynamical dimension be lowered from six to four so that it would not destroy renormalizability .",
    "however , to cancel the vacuum energy density infinities completely we will need to include not just the four - fermion contribution but also the contribution of quantum conformal gravity itself .",
    "we discuss these vacuum energy issues in sec .",
    "iv and in sec .",
    "v.    also in sec .",
    "iv we compare our work on dynamical symmetry breaking with other approaches that have appeared in the literature .",
    "in particular , we contrast our work with studies of the quenched , planar graph , ladder approximation to the abelian gluon model , and show that we obtain dynamical goldstone and higgs bosons in the weak coupling regime where , based on these quenched ladder studies , it is generally thought that no generation of dynamical bound states could occur . while these same quenched ladder studies show that one can obtain dynamical goldstone and higgs bosons in the strong coupling limit since in going from weak to strong coupling a phase transition occurs , in sec .",
    "iv we call this wisdom into question by showing that it is not actually valid to use the quenched ladder approximation in the strong coupling regime as the non - planar graphs that are left out are not only just as big as the planar ones that are included , they serve to eliminate the phase transition altogether , to thereby eliminate the rationale for requiring strong coupling in the first place . finally , in sec .",
    "v we show that conformal symmetry can achieve all of the key results of supersymmetry , and thus essentially supplant it as a candidate fundamental symmetry of nature . in this section",
    "we present a candidate model for the action of the universe , one based on conformal gravity , a non - abelian yang - mills gauge theory , and a four - fermion interaction as made renormalizable by critical scaling and anomalous dimensions .",
    "we show that the model is not only renormalizable , it is even finite .",
    "in order to explore whether the higgs field might be dynamical we need a tractable calculational scheme in which one can study dynamical symmetry breaking via fermion bilinear condensates non - perturbatively . to this end",
    "we adapt some earlier work of the present author from the 1970s .",
    "this earlier work was itself based on even earlier work of johnson , baker , and willey from the 1960s on quantum electrodynamics .",
    "the objective of the study of johnson , baker , and willey was to determine whether it might be possible for all the renormalization constants of a quantum field theory to be finite .",
    "quantum electrodynamics was a particularly convenient theory to study since its gauge structure meant that two of its renormalization constants ( the fermion - antifermion - gauge boson vertex renormalization constant @xmath5 and the fermion wave function renormalization constant @xmath6 to which @xmath5 is equal ) were gauge dependent and could be made finite by an appropriate choice of gauge , with the anomalous dimension of the fermion @xmath7 consequently then being zero  and for convenience in the following we shall set @xmath5 and @xmath6 equal to one .",
    "johnson , baker , and willey were thus left with the gauge boson wave function renormalization constant @xmath8 and the fermion bare mass @xmath9 and its shift @xmath10 to address .",
    "now if one were also to consider the coupling of electrodynamics to gravity , one would then have to address another infinity that electrodynamics possesses , namely that of the zero - point vacuum energy density , and one of the objectives of the present paper is to address this issue .",
    "since johnson , baker , and willey were considering electrodynamics in flat space , the need to address the vacuum energy density infinity did not arise in their study as it could be normal ordered away .    as regards @xmath8 and @xmath9 , johnson , baker , and willey showed that @xmath8 would be finite if the fermion - antifermion - gauge boson coupling constant @xmath11 was at a solution to the gell - mann - low eigenvalue condition  and for convenience in the following we shall set @xmath8 equal to one .",
    "at this eigenvalue they showed that the bare mass scaled as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an ultraviolet cutoff and @xmath14 is the renormalized fermion mass .",
    "consequently if the power @xmath15 is negative , which it is perturbatively [ @xmath16 , the bare mass would vanish in the limit of infinite cutoff and @xmath10 would be finite . as such",
    ", the work of johnson , baker , and willey was quite remarkable since it predated the work of wilson and of callan and symanzik on critical scaling and the renormalization group .",
    "subsequently , adler and bardeen @xcite recast the work of johnson , baker , and willey in the language of the renormalization group itself , and showed that the renormalized inverse fermion propagator @xmath17 and the renormalized vertex function @xmath18 associated with the insertion of the composite operator @xmath19 with zero momentum into the fermion propagator were related by @xmath20\\tilde{s}^{-1}(p , m)=-m[1-\\gamma_{\\theta}(\\alpha)]\\tilde{\\gamma}_{\\rm s}(p , p,0,m ) \\label{l2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the limit in which the fermion momentum @xmath21 is deep euclidean and @xmath7 is zero . in the critical scaling situation where @xmath22",
    "this equation admits of an exact asymptotic solution @xmath23 with the parameter @xmath15 of ( [ l1 ] ) thus being identifiable as the anomalous dimension @xmath24 of @xmath0 , and with the full dimension of @xmath0 being given by @xmath25 , the mechanism for both the finiteness and vanishing of @xmath9 is to have the dimension of @xmath0 be less than canonical .",
    "in general , a @xmath26 fermion propagator @xmath27 would obey the , as yet unrenormalized , schwinger - dyson equation @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the exact photon propagator , @xmath30 is the bare charge , and @xmath31 is the exact photon - fermion - anti - fermion vertex .",
    "johnson , baker , and willey @xcite initially studied this equation in the limit in which @xmath29 was taken to be the bare photon propagator , but in which @xmath32 and @xmath31 were otherwise fully dressed , and obtained the asymptotic scaling behavior @xmath33 of the type exhibited in ( [ l3 ] ) .",
    "subsequently , they found @xcite that they could justify the use of an undressed photon propagator if the bare charge satisfied the gell - mann - low eigenvalue equation .",
    "if we set @xmath34 ( as would follow from ( [ l1 ] ) in the limit of large cutoff if @xmath35 ) , the schwinger - dyson equation could have both trivial and non - trivial solutions for @xmath36 . then",
    ", if the non - zero solution is chosen , the fermion mass would behave just as dynamical masses behave in self - consistent theories of mass generation , and so one initially would expect the presence of a massless pseudoscalar goldstone boson associated with the generation of such a fermion mass . however , this turned out not to be the case since there was a hidden renormalization effect in the theory , one associated with the renormalization constant @xmath37 that renormalizes @xmath0 according to @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "( @xmath39 is also equal to @xmath40 the vertex renormalization constant for @xmath41 . ) with the product @xmath42 being equal to @xmath43 , and thus equal to @xmath44 on setting @xmath45 to be the finite but non - zero @xmath46 , the mass term @xmath47 is then a renormalization group invariant , with a non - zero @xmath42 term thus being present in the bare lagrangian from the outset .",
    "consequently , the chiral symmetry is already broken in the lagrangian itself and the goldstone theorem does not apply .",
    "this then is the baker - johnson @xcite evasion of the goldstone theorem .    to understand the role played by the bare mass , it is instructive to look not at the schwinger - dyson equation , but at the bethe - salpeter equation for the anticommutator of @xmath48 with @xmath36 , viz .",
    "@xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the bethe - salpter kernel . to obtain an asymptotic solution to ( [ l5 ] )",
    "johnson first improved the convergence properties of the bethe - salpeter kernel integral by noting that the subtracted @xmath51 at two values of the momenta was well - defined . thus if either the bare mass is identically zero or if it vanishes in the limit of infinite cutoff , the subtracted @xmath52 is well - defined . from this subtracted equation johnson was then able to extract out an asymptotic solution for @xmath53 , and it was found to precisely be of the scaling form .",
    "however , since the @xmath9-dependent term had dropped out , we see that one can get asymptotic scaling for the fermion propagator without needing to require that @xmath9 be zero identically .",
    "a form in which @xmath9 only vanishes in the limit of infinite cutoff , but is not zero identically , is thus compatible with a fermion propagator that satisfies a homogeneous equation , with inspection of ( [ l4 ] ) or the subtracted version of ( [ l5 ] ) in and of themselves not immediately indicating what the relevant situation for @xmath9 might be .",
    "rather one needs to actually determine @xmath9 to see whether or not it behaves as in ( [ l1 ] ) , and , as we explain below , one needs to check whether or not there actually is a pole in the pseudoscalar sector .",
    "below in sec .",
    "iv - i we shall elucidate the role played by @xmath9 by discussing an approximation to the full jbw calculation , the so - called quenched ladder approximation , in which one restricts to a bare ( i.e. quenched ) photon , and only keeps planar diagrams ( the ladder or rainbow approximation ) .",
    "now as originally noted in @xcite , in order to establish the presence of a goldstone boson it is not sufficient to look at the self - consistent equation for the fermion mass alone .",
    "rather , one must look at the fermion - antifermion scattering amplitude , to see whether there might actually be a massless pole in it , or whether the renormalization procedure might prevent this from occurring .",
    "and when johnson , baker , and willey did this in their study of electrodynamics , they found that there was no massless goldstone pole , with the kernel of the bethe - salpeter equation for the scattering amplitude being found to be non - compact , so that no pole was generated . thus having a non - trivial solution to the self - consistent equation for the mass",
    "is a necessary but not sufficient condition to secure a goldstone pole .",
    "( the self - consistent mass equation is essentially the self - consistent equation for the residue at the goldstone pole , and from a study of the equation for the would - be residue alone one can not establish the presence of the pole itself . ) the cause of this lack of a goldstone boson in the presence of dynamical mass generation was explored by baker and johnson and is known as the baker - johnson evasion of the goldstone theorem .    to further illustrate the issues involved we note that if there is to be a goldstone boson it must also appear in @xmath54 , the insertion of the pseudoscalar @xmath55 into the fermion propagator",
    "this green s function obeys @xmath56 here the tilde symbol indicates that everything is renormalized , with @xmath57 renormalizing the pseudoscalar vertex function . since the large @xmath58 behavior of the theory is not sensitive to mass , this @xmath57 is equal to the previously introduced @xmath59 , with @xmath57 vanishing as @xmath60 . to see if there is a pole we note that we can rewrite ( [ l6 ] ) by inserting its left - hand side into its right - hand side iteratively , to symbolically then obtain @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is an appropriate vacuum polarization term .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath63 then with @xmath64 diverging much faster than @xmath62 , no pole is generated .",
    "thus one again obtains the baker - johnson evasion of the goldstone theorem . and",
    "not only would this imply that there is no dynamical pseudoscalar bound state goldstone particle in the theory , implicit in the analysis is that there would be no dynamical scalar bound state higgs particle either .",
    "now , in and of itself , the fact that ( [ l6 ] ) becomes homogeneous when @xmath57 vanishes does not automatically exclude the possible presence of a pole , since an analogous situation is met in the non - renormalizable but cut - off njl model . as we discuss in more detail in sec .",
    "iii , there one introduces a four - fermion coupling @xmath65 , and in the pseudoscalar channel of the fermion - antifermion scattering amplitude one obtains a @xmath66-matrix of the form is of the symbolic form @xmath67 , with the kernel being given here by @xmath68 to lowest order in the four - fermion interaction . ]",
    "@xmath69 now in the njl case both @xmath70 and @xmath62 are divergent in the limit of infinite cutoff and @xmath68 is zero .",
    "however , even though both @xmath70 and @xmath62 are divergent , they both diverge at the precisely the same rate , with there then indeed being a massless pole in @xmath71 . while one would automatically obtain a pole",
    "if @xmath68 and @xmath62 are both finite ( given dynamical mass generation of course ) , one could also obtain a pole if @xmath70 and @xmath62 diverge , provided they diverge at the same rate . in the renormalizable model we discuss in sec .",
    "iv , we will see that both goldstone and higgs bosons will be generated by such a mechanism .",
    "now even though the non - trivial solution to the self - consistent fermion mass generating equation given in ( [ l4 ] ) might not require a goldstone boson , there was still the issue of determining what would oblige the theory to actually choose the non - trivial solution to it rather than the trivial one in the first place .",
    "to this end the present author compared the energy densities of the two solutions to find @xcite that if @xmath24 took the special value @xmath73 the infrared divergences that would then follow ( the theory having been softened so much in the ultraviolet and thus made more and more divergent in the infrared ) would then drive the theory into a spontaneously broken vacuum @xmath74 in which @xmath75 . in order to take care of the infinities that the energy density contained the present author chose not to normal order them away , but rather to cancel them by a counterterm , with the appropriate one being a four - fermion interaction with coupling constant @xmath68 .",
    "now for a point - coupled such interaction this counterterm would itself generate new infinities . however with the dimension of @xmath0",
    "having been reduced from @xmath76 to @xmath77 , the dimension of @xmath78 was reduced from six to four so that it had become renormalizable , something we expound on in detail in sec .",
    "v - a below . with this specific counterterm",
    "the then finite energy density was found to have none other than a double - well potential structure in which @xmath79 was non - zero . specifically , in terms of a renormalization group subtraction point @xmath80 that we elaborate on in sec .",
    "iv below , the renormalized energy density was given as the double - welled @xmath81 , \\label{l10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with a local maximum at @xmath82 where @xmath83 and a degenerate global minimum at @xmath84 where @xmath85 is non - zero .",
    "mass generation in jbw electrodynamics is thus associated with a vacuum in which @xmath86 is non - zero .    as originally introduced by kadanoff and wilson ,",
    "critical scaling described the behavior of a crystal at the critical phase transition temperature where the correlation length is infinite .",
    "however at the same critical temperature the order parameter is zero , with it only being non - zero in the ordered phase below the critical temperature . in the case of critical scaling in a quantum field theory , when @xmath72 we can have both scaling with anomalous dimensions and a non - zero value for the order parameter @xmath87 occur simultaneously .",
    "this happens because in a massless theory ( analogous to an infinite correlation length ) there is no scale , so infrared divergences ( needed to generate long range order and an order parameter ) are also present ; with the effect of @xmath72 being to soften the theory so much in the ultraviolet that it becomes sufficiently divergent in the infrared to cause dynamical symmetry breaking to take place .",
    "our work thus provides a framework in which aspects of critical phenomena both at and below the critical temperature are simultaneously present . and",
    "in fact one of the motivations for the work of the present author in the 1970s was to try to find such a framework , with it being through the condition @xmath72 that it was achieved .    to underscore and illuminate the interplay between mass generation and",
    "the spontaneously broken vacuum , a second , independent derivation of the @xmath72 condition was also provided in @xcite . in this derivation",
    "the fermion propagator was derived in two separate ways , via the wilson operator product expansion and via a renormalization group analysis , and compatibility between the two was sought .",
    "the wilson expansion describes the short distance behavior of a massless theory as constructed in a non - spontaneously broken normal vacuum @xmath88 .",
    "the renormalization group describes the short - distance behavior of a theory in which the fermion mass is non - zero .",
    "in such a theory we have seen that since the mass is non - zero , at critical scaling the renormalization group describes fluctuations around a spontaneously broken vacuum @xmath74 . to compare the two we thus take matrix elements of the wilson expansion in @xmath74 .",
    "specifically , in the wilson operator product expansion at a critical point the leading behavior at short distance of the massless fermion two point function is given by @xmath89 where the dots indicate normal ordering with respect to the massless vacuum @xmath88 according to @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath80 is an off - shell green s function subtraction point .",
    "if we now take the matrix element of this expansion in the degenerate vacuum @xmath74 we obtain an asymptotic propagator and inverse propagator that up to coefficients behave as @xmath92 on comparing with ( [ l3 ] ) , ( [ l9 ] ) follows .",
    "( in @xcite it was shown that the coefficients match too . )",
    "moreover , not only do we recover ( [ l9 ] ) , we confirm that the relevant vacuum for jbw electrodynamics is indeed a spontaneously broken one . is also encountered in the quenched ladder approximation to an abelian gluon model when the coupling constant is given by @xmath93 , and will be discussed in sec .",
    "iv - i below . ]      as we see , the jbw theory has much of the structure of dynamical symmetry breaking and yet has no dynamical goldstone boson , and thus no dynamical higgs boson either .",
    "moreover it has much of the structure of the njl model .",
    "the essence of the njl model is to rewrite the four - fermion lagrangian with a strictly massless fermion in terms of a mean - field sector action with a massive fermion term that is not in the initial lagrangian , together with a compensating residual interaction sector action according to @xmath94 where @xmath95 even though the full lagrangian @xmath96 is globally chiral symmetric under @xmath97 with spacetime independent phase @xmath98 , neither @xmath99 nor @xmath100 are themselves separately chirally symmetric .",
    "thus in dynamical symmetry breaking one produces a mean - field theory in which the chiral symmetry is expressly broken at the level of the mean - field lagrangian .",
    "moreover , no goldstone boson is present in the mean - field lagrangian , as could not be the case since the mean - field lagrangian is expressly not chiral symmetric .",
    "rather , one is generated not by the mean field at all but by the residual interaction , and it is the residual interaction that is needed in order to restore the chiral symmetry that the mean - field sector itself does not possess .",
    "now , as had been noted by the present author in @xcite , study of symmetry breaking in jbw electrodynamics can be obtained from the njl model by replacing the point vertex for the insertion of a zero - momentum scalar @xmath0 operator into the fermion propagator ( viz .",
    "@xmath101 ) by @xmath102 as given above by the renormalization group equation .",
    "thus , as we show in detail in sec .",
    "iv , we can reinterpret jbw electrodynamics as coupled to a four - fermion interaction to be a mean - field theory , one associated with lagrangian of the form : @xmath103 where the @xmath104 term is just a constant . and",
    "as such , this theory should not contain a goldstone boson since mean - field theory never does , with the baker - johnson evasion of the goldstone theorem then necessarily having to hold in the mean - field sector . and indeed , for a critical scaling electrodynamics to admit of a mean - field theory structure in the first place , the mean - field theory must thus necessarily be of the baker - johnson - evasion type .",
    "nonetheless , as we show in secs .",
    "iv - e and iv - f , the related residual interaction will generate a massless pseudoscalar goldstone boson , and will do so while generating a massive scalar higgs boson at the same time .",
    "thus by enlarging electrodynamics to include a dynamical four - fermion interaction we are able to evade the baker - johnson evasion of the goldstone theorem , and relate the dynamically generated mass and the spontaneously broken symmetry in the mean - field sector to a goldstone boson after all . then , as a very welcome bonus , we obtain a dynamical higgs boson as well .",
    "while we shall present our derivation of these results below , we note here that all we actually need for the discussion is the behavior of the pure fermion green s functions containing fermion fields and fermion @xmath0 insertions , and for them we only need the assumption of scaling with anomalous dimensions ( or equivalently conformal invariance with anomalous dimensions ) .",
    "we do not actually need to specify how the critical scaling was brought about , and thus do not actually need to introduce any explicit coupling to gauge bosons whose associated dynamics could cause coupling constant renormalization beta functions ( such as @xmath105 ) to actually vanish .",
    "our results are thus quite generic , and will continue to hold even if there are many species of fermion ( assuming critical scaling of course ) , so that it thus suffices to discuss a single species of fermion and a single type of symmetry ( in our case chiral symmetry ) alone . also we note that we only need to discuss spontaneous breakdown of a global symmetry , since once we have generated a massless goldstone boson by some dynamical means , jackiw and johnson showed @xcite that such a dynamically generated goldstone boson would automatically couple to a massless external gauge field with the relevant quantum numbers , and would put a massless pole in the gauge boson vacuum polarization .",
    "this would then cause the gauge boson to become massive , to thus provide an explicit dynamical realization of the higgs mechanism that was presented in @xcite .",
    "the njl model is a chirally - symmetric four - fermion model of interacting massless fermions with action @xmath106 ^ 2-\\frac{g}{2}[\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma_5\\psi]^2\\right ] .",

    "finally , we note that in the literature attention has focussed on the fact that in the njl model the dynamical higgs boson is a stable bound state that lies right at the particle - antiparticle threshold with a mass twice that of the dynamical fermion .",

    "is associated with strong coupling alone , something that initially seems reasonable since experience with quantum mechanics indicates that weak coupling does not lead to binding , with the 3-dimensional square well potential for instance only being able to bind above a certain minimum strength . in a 3-dimensional well of depth @xmath426 and width @xmath427 , binding only occurs if @xmath428 .",
    "] however , a particle in a potential is a one - body problem with a small number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the dynamics is entirely different when the system is a many - body system , as is the case in bcs theory of superconductivity .",
    "specifically , in the bcs theory a pair of electrons can bind into a cooper pair no matter how weak the coupling between them might be provided only that it is attractive @xcite .",
    "it is the filling of the fermi sea by all the other electrons in the superconductor that prevents the cooper pairs from occupying low momentum states , to thus force the pairing wave function to be damped at large distances .",
    "because of the effect of the filled fermi sea , an attractive force between the electrons in a cooper pair ( as produced through the ions in the superconductor ) no matter how weak it might be will lead to binding .",
    "cooper pairing is thus an intrinsically many - body effect , with the system of interest not being just the two electrons in the cooper pair but the two electrons plus a filled fermi sea .",
    "moreover , exactly the same situation is met in the jbw - njl model with @xmath72 , where the negative energy dirac sea plays a role analogous to the fermi sea in a metal , with the gap equation given in ( [ l49 ] ) requiring only that the coupling be attractive , no matter how weak it may be . moreover , with the vacuum energy density being given by an infinite sum of massless feynman graphs as per ( [ l35 ] ) , every single one of these graphs would be infrared divergent . as discussed in @xcite , when @xmath72",
    "the theory is softened so much in the ultraviolet that these infrared divergences become so severe that the theory is forced into a new vacuum where the fermion is no longer massless .",
    "this occurs not because the coupling is strong but because the infrared divergences are so severe .",
    "thus strong coupling is not mandatory for dynamical symmetry breaking .    since strong coupling is not mandatory for dynamical symmetry breaking we need to explain why study of the quenched ladder approximation suggested that it is .",
    "to this end we note that the quenched ladder approximation involves two kinds of assumptions , namely a canonical photon and a restriction to planar graphs .",
    "so we need to ask what happens when these assumptions are relaxed .",
    "the problem of including the non - planar graphs while keeping the photon canonical was actually solved exactly by johnson , baker , and willey , as that was the objective of the first of their papers on electrodynamics @xcite . in that paper",
    "they showed that the all order schwinger - dyson equation had an exact asymptotic solution in which the fermion propagator scaled as a power of the momentum of the fermion ( cf .",
    "( [ l3 ] ) ) when the photon propagator is canonical .",
    "since the calculation only involved the asymptotic momentum properties of feynman diagrams with none being left out ( other than those involved in dressing the photon propagator ) , as johnson , baker , and willey themselves noted , their result held no matter what the strength of the coupling constant .",
    "their result thus holds for both weak and strong coupling , with there being no transition region in which the quenched ladder power solution given in ( [ m85 ] ) switches into the oscillating solution given in ( [ m89 ] ) .",
    "rather , no matter what the strength of the coupling constant , the solution is always in the regime in which the bare mass is not identically zero but only vanishes in the limit of large cutoff as per ( [ l1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , since the quenched approximation involves no charge renormalization , it corresponds to a renormalization group equation in which the @xmath105 term is omitted identically no matter what the value of @xmath11 , with asymptotic scaling then being the exact asymptotic solution to ( [ l2 ] ) for any value of @xmath11 . when treated to all orders then , the quenched , non - planar graphs completely cancel the phase transition found in the quenched , planar graph approximation , and no phase transition occurs .    in second of their papers",
    "@xcite johnson , baker , and willey showed that even if one then dressed the photon propagator , it would remain canonical if the bare coupling constant obeyed the gell - mann eigenvalue equation , with power behavior then being the exact asymptotic solution to the renormalization group equation given in ( [ l2 ] ) . , the utility of being at a gell - mann - low eigenvalue is that the residue of the deep spacelike region landau ghost state in the photon propagator then vanishes , with the theory then being free of states of negative norm . ] thus whether the @xmath105 term does not contribute to ( [ l2 ] ) because it is taken to be zero for all @xmath11 or because it is only zero for one value of @xmath11 , the fermion propagator is asymptotically power behaved , and the abelian gluon model does not exhibit dynamical symmetry breaking .",
    "so how then do we reconcile the all - graph jbw result with the quenched planar graph result of @xcite . to understand the difference we note that while the planar graphs include the first two graphs in fig .",
    "( [ sd1 ] ) and their higher - order planar analogs , left out are the third graph and its higher - order non - planar analogs . however , the third graph in fig .",
    "( [ sd1 ] ) is of the same order as the second graph in fig .",
    "( [ sd1 ] ) .",
    "thus already in second order in @xmath11 we see a difference . and",
    "indeed the impact of non - planar graphs can already be seen in this order , since if we expand the quenched approximation @xmath364 to second order according to @xmath429 , it differs from the exact second - order expression @xmath430 found by johnson , baker , and willey under the same assumption of a canonical photon propagator .",
    "the planar graph approximation is thus only a weak coupling approximation for @xmath373 but noted that it was only valid for weak coupling . ] and its extrapolation to strong coupling is unjustified .    even though we have seen that the abelian gluon model does not in and of itself exhibit a phase transition as it is always in the baker - johnson regime for all values of the coupling constant , nonetheless , our interest in this paper is in working in the baker - johnson regime , where gauge boson exchange expressly does not generate any bound state goldstone boson or higgs boson in the fermion - antifermion scattering amplitude . with this regime",
    "not having been thought to be of interest for dynamical symmetry breaking , it has essentially not been considered any further in the literature . despite this , as we have seen in this paper , we can augment a weakly - coupled massless fermion qed with an equally weakly - coupled dynamical dimension four , non - perturbatively renormalizable , massless fermion four - fermion interaction , and then reinterpret qed in the baker - johnson regime as a mean - field theory with a massive fermion . and as such , there would indeed be no photon - exchange - generated goldstone boson in the mean - field sector , since mean - field theory never does contain a goldstone boson .",
    "nonetheless , as we have also seen , through the four - fermion residual interaction we then do generate a dynamical pseudoscalar goldstone boson , and do generate a dynamical scalar higgs boson , one whose mass is naturally close to the threshold in the fermion - antifermion scattering amplitude , and not orders of magnitude larger than it .",
    "the key difference between our approach and that of the others described above is that we work in the weak coupling regime where gauge boson exchange does not generate any dynamical goldstone or higgs bound state , and yet still do get such bound states through an entirely different mechanism , namely that generated by a weakly coupled four - fermion residual interaction .",
    "moreover , as we show below , such a four - fermion interaction must be included as a vacuum energy density counterterm , since once we couple the theory to gravity we can no longer ignore ( i.e. normal order away ) the vacuum energy density , as the hallmark of einstein s formulation of gravity is that gravity must couple to every form of energy density whatsoever , and not to energy density difference . and if the vacuum energy density that gravity couples to is infinite , that infinity must be cancelled by an appropriate counterterm . in addition , we note that this gravitationally induced need for four - fermion counterterms applies not just to abelian theories but to non - abelian theories as well , with their renormalizability requiring that the relevant four - fermion counterterms have their dimension reduced from six to four .",
    "this even though it needs to be studied further , our analysis suggests that as well as abelian theories , non - abelian theories also be realized via critical scaling with anomalous dimensions .",
    "if we generate a dynamical fermion mass by giving the composite operator @xmath0 a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value , we would break not just the chiral symmetry but would break scale symmetry as well , since @xmath0 is dimensionful .",
    "however , since only one composite operator is involved , giving the operator a non - vanishing expectation value could only generate one goldstone boson and not two .",
    "hence it suffices to look at the implications of chiral symmetry breaking alone . in the chiral symmetry breaking case then , if we do generate a pseudoscalar bound state , because of the underlying chiral symmetry , we must generate a scalar bound state as well .",
    "however , the goldstone theorem only requires that one of these bound states be massless , with the other one needing to be massive , and to thus have a mass that would then naturally be related to the symmetry breaking scale that generated the fermion mass in the first place .    in general , to determine how many bound states are to be generated when",
    "there is dynamical symmetry breaking , it is very instructive to look not at the bound state equations as evaluated with massive fermion propagators , but to evaluate them with massless ones instead .",
    "on doing so , this will then lead to a set of degenerate tachyons , and tell us how many states there are in that set",
    ". the number of such states will be the same as the number of bound states that will be obtained after we change the vacuum and evaluate using massive fermion propagators . however , once the symmetry is broken the states will no longer be degenerate ( or tachyonic ) .",
    "we carried this tachyonic analysis through for both the point - coupled njl ( sec .",
    "iii ) and the dressed jbw - njl ( sec .",
    "iv ) cases , and in both cases we found just one scalar tachyon and one pseudoscalar tachyon . we did not need to appeal to the breaking of a symmetry such as scale invariance with its potential pseudo - goldstone dilaton , and instead identified the higgs particle as the chiral partner of the goldstone boson associated with chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "moreover , we do not need to introduce a small breaking of the scale symmetry by hand in the lagrangian in order to give a would - be dilaton a small mass and make it a light pseudo - goldstone boson .",
    "rather , we can keep the chiral symmetry exact at the level of the lagrangian ( and the scale symmetry too ) , break the chiral symmetry ( and scale symmetry ) only in the vacuum , and finish up with a necessarily massive scalar bound state higgs particle whose mass is naturally of the order of the chiral symmetry breaking scale , and not orders of magnitude larger .    thus just as with the double - well potential associated with an elementary higgs field",
    ", it is very instructive to first explore what happens if we quantize around the unbroken vacuum , and if on doing so we discover the presence of tachyons , we know that we need to change the vacuum . since we did find such a double - well structure in the mean - field effective higgs lagrangians presented in sec .",
    "iii and sec .",
    "iv ( an @xmath431 generalization of ( [ l23 ] ) may be found in @xcite ) , we know that in both the point - coupled njl and the dressed jbw - njl cases we need to change the vacuum , just as we then did in our paper . while we do find a double - well potential structure in the effective higgs lagrangians presented in sec .",
    "iii and sec .",
    "iv , both of those lagrangians are only c - number effective mean - field lagrangians for c - number matrix elements of fermion bilinear composites .",
    "they are not to be quantized  in fact they only arise after the fundamental fermionic theory already has been quantized and the condensates have formed .",
    "consequently , the value of the second derivative of any such effective potential at its minimum is not a measure of the mass of the dynamical higgs boson that would then be generated by the residual interaction .",
    "( in fact in our case it anyway could not be since the second derivative of the effective potential given in ( [ l56 ] ) is real while the mass of the dynamical higgs boson that we find is complex , as it is an above - threshold resonance with a non - zero width . ) nonetheless , the fact that such effective potentials do have well - defined non - trivial minima is an indication that the residual interaction will in fact generate dynamical bound states .    while our work could generalize to the non - abelian case",
    "if there is critical scaling with anomalous dimensions , in the literature most analyses of dynamical symmetry breaking have focused on the fact that non - abelian gauge theories are asymptotically free in perturbation theory .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath432 qcd case with @xmath433 fermions and coupling constant @xmath434 , the first two terms in the expansion of the coupling constant renormalization @xmath435 function are given by @xmath436 , where @xmath437 , @xmath438 .",
    "while both @xmath439 and @xmath440 have the same positive sign for small enough @xmath433 , @xmath440 can change sign if @xmath441 .",

    "@xmath442 . within ( a part of ) this window it is thought that gauge - boson - exchange - generated dynamical symmetry breaking could occur .    in the literature",
    "it has been argued that if the @xmath435 function of a non - abelian gauge theory had a zero away from the origin , one might be able to be near ( the non - abelian equivalent of ) @xmath365 and could then implement the walking technicolor scenario in which there is a slow running of the coupling constant so as to separate the confinement and symmetry breaking phases @xcite , with general discussion of the non - abelian case being found in @xcite and references therein . in @xmath432 the anomalous dimension of the fermion mass operator",
    "is given by ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) @xmath443 , and like in the abelian case starts off negative in lowest order , and would remain negative in second order if @xmath444 , with propagators then being asymptotically damped . to have @xmath445 be close to two through second order in @xmath105 would require a careful tuning of the number of fermions .",
    "such a tuning would not be necessary however if instead the non - abelian gauge theory is realized via non - perturbative critical scaling , with the dimension of @xmath0 being reduced from three to two in order to produce vacuum breaking .",
    "because of studies of models such as the quenched ladder approximation to the abelian gluon theory in the @xmath446 region , it had been thought that dynamical symmetry breaking can only occur for strong coupling . and with the weak interaction symmetry breaking scale ( viz .",

    "@xmath448 ) that is to be produced by qcd dynamics , a non - abelian technicolor gauge theory of strength greater than qcd has been invoked in order to break the weak interaction symmetry dynamically .",
    "this breaking induces high mass ( tev or so region ) technifermions and should lead to an equally high mass dynamical higgs boson . while theoretical attempts to then bring the higgs mass down to the 125 gev value that it is now known to have are currently ongoing , no satisfactory solution to this problem has yet been found , with attempts to have the higgs boson emerge as a relatively light ( viz .",

    "moreover , it is natural that we should associate the three goldstone bosons and the single higgs boson with the same symmetry ( viz .",
    "chiral symmetry , not scale symmetry ) since they all belong to the same complex doublet representation of @xmath456 .",
    "now as well as the weak interaction having a goldstone structure , the strong interaction does too , with quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) possessing a global chiral flavor symmetry that is spontaneously broken to yield the pion family chiral multiplet .",
    "all of the members of this multiplet remain in the spectrum and none is incorporated ( i.e. higgsed ) into any massive gauge boson .",
    "there are thus two separate goldstone boson families in nature , not one , and we would need some mechanism to distinguish them , as we would not know whether to assign quark condensate breaking to the strong or the weak interaction .",
    "now one of the advantages of introducing technicolor is that one can address this question , with quark condensates breaking the strong interaction and technifermion condensates then breaking the weak interaction . however , suppose the weak interaction is chiral invariant .",
    "we would then need to break @xmath449 down to @xmath431 . to generate the needed @xmath451 triplet dynamically",
    ", we would need a difermion made of a pair of fermions each one of which transforms as a doublet under @xmath451 .",
    "however , we would also need the difermion pair operator to be electrically neutral if it is to go into the vacuum .",
    "thus absent technineutrinos , we must do the breaking via the conventional neutrinos , the only currently known electrically neutral fundamental fermions .",
    "thus instead of technifermion condensates , we ( admittedly speculatively ) propose that the strong interaction chiral symmetry be broken entirely by quark condensates , and a weak interaction chiral symmetry be broken entirely by lepton condensates , i.e. by right - handed neutrino majorana masses , and then by charged and neutral lepton dirac masses .",
    "now a reader might initially baulk at a proposal such as this since weak interactions are so weak .",
    "however , they are not so weak before the symmetry is broken , as their weakness is due not to a weak coupling strength but due to the large intermediate vector boson masses that are expressly generated by the symmetry breaking mechanism itself . also , more mass scales can be generated if the strong , electromagnetic and weak interactions are all embedded in some grand unifying gauge group . and indeed , precisely such grand unifying scales are utilized in the seesaw mechanism , which could explain the very small ( milli electron volt ) masses found for the left - handed neutrinos . in this mechanism the neutrino mass matrix is a @xmath457 matrix in the space of the left- and right - handed neutrinos , with matrix elements @xmath458 , @xmath459 , @xmath460 , where @xmath111 is a dirac mass and @xmath461 is a right - handed neutrino majorana mass . for @xmath462 ,",
    "the mass eigenvalues are given by @xmath463 and @xmath461 .",
    "then for a typical @xmath464 , @xmath465 ( i.e. @xmath111 of order the higgs boson mass ) , @xmath466 would be of order @xmath467 .",
    "the seesaw mechanism thus relies on gev scale neutrino dirac masses and not on mev scale ones , to thus suggest that the neutrino dirac mass scale is much larger than the mev neutrino mass scale measured in neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "however , while we have explained in this paper how one could generate a dynamical higgs boson in the baker - johnson regime , getting explicit numerical values for dynamical mass scales is beyond the scope of the present paper and remains to be addressed .",
    "having discussed how dynamical symmetry breaking works in dressed jbw - njl type theories , and with the associated anomalous dimensions appearing because of the underlying conformal symmetry of qed , we turn now to a general comparison of conformal symmetry with supersymmetry , and shall give particular attention to the vacuum energy density , to the role of the four - fermion interaction , and to conformal gravity , a conformal invariant theory of gravity that has been advanced as a candidate alternative to the standard einstein gravitational theory .",
    "because of the fermi statistics of half - integer spin particles and the bose statistics of integer spin particles , the feynman diagrams of closed fermion loops and closed boson loops have opposite overall signs",
    ". consequently , they are able to cancel each others perturbative infinities to some degree .",
    "this can occur not just in supersymmetry but also in supergravity , its local extension ( a recent review of cancellations in the supergravity case may be found in @xcite ) .    to compare and contrast with conformal symmetry",
    ", we note that with critical scaling there is also a cancellation of infinities .",
    "however , it does not occur order by order in perturbation theory .",
    "rather , it is only achieved non - perturbatively via an infinite summation of diagrams . in this paper",
    "we have encountered four examples of this , the finiteness of the gauge boson wave function renormalization constant @xmath8 , the form for @xmath9 given in ( [ l1 ] ) , the structure of @xmath468 and @xmath469 in both the massless and massive cases , and the form for @xmath124 as given in ( [ l50 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath8 the finiteness is achieved immediately just by being at a critical point where @xmath22 .",
    "for @xmath9 it is instructive to expand ( [ l1 ] ) as @xmath470}. \\label{m96}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this expansion all the radiative - correction terms individually diverge .",
    "however because of critical scaling the coefficients of these terms are such that their non - perturbative sum exponentiates , with the sum itself then being finite if @xmath24 is negative . thus if one were to write ( [ m96 ] ) as some low - order perturbative term plus a counterterm , the counterterm would then represent the rest of the series .",
    "thus in the language of perturbation theory , critical scaling uniquely fixes the needed counterterm .",
    "since the cancellation is really a cancellation of infinities in the vertex renormalization constant @xmath471 that multiplicatively renormalizes the massless theory @xmath472 to give @xmath473 , it is a purely ultraviolet effect .",
    "thus it can occur in either a massless theory or in the short - distance behavior of a massive theory , with it not being sensitive to any mass generation that might be taking place in the infrared .    as well as control the short - distance behavior of mass - related green s functions such as the insertion of a single @xmath0 into the inverse fermion propagator ( viz .",
    "@xmath474 as per ( [ l42 ] ) ) , the requirement of conformal invariance also controls the short - distance behavior of green s functions involving more than one @xmath0 , doing so even though they play no direct role in qed itself other than in its vacuum energy density .",
    "specifically , without as yet any reference to a four - fermion interaction , consider the two - point function @xmath475 . in a free fermion theory it consists of two @xmath0 insertions in a free fermion loop , with the leading term in its fourier",
    "transform being the quadratic divergence given in ( [ l26 ] ) .",
    "if we now switch on a critical scaling qed the bare vertices get dressed with anomalous dimensions into @xmath241 as given in ( [ l54 ] ) , with the leading term in the fourier transform of @xmath138 now only being the logarithmic divergence given in ( [ l58 ] ) when @xmath365 .",
    "thus in a critical scaling qed with @xmath365 , the ultraviolet structure of the @xmath0 green s functions is softened from quadratic to logarithmic ( and likewise for the @xmath55 green s functions ) . hence regardless of any",
    "possible coupling of qed to a four - fermion interaction , the ultraviolet structure of the @xmath0 green s functions in both the massless and massive fermion qed cases is no higher than a readily renormalizable logarithmic .",
    "in addition , we note that if there is critical scaling in qed at short distances , the short - distance behavior of @xmath138 is uniquely fixed by conformal invariance , and takes the very specific form given in ( [ l51 ] ) .",
    "if we now make a wilson expansion around @xmath476 , we see that the leading singularity behaves as @xmath477^{d_{\\theta}}]$ ] .",
    "thus as we bring the coordinates of the two @xmath0 terms together we obtain one @xmath478 ^ 2 $ ] term with dimension @xmath479 , and thus establish that with critical scaling the dynamical dimension of @xmath478 ^ 2 $ ] is @xmath479 , to thus be equal to a renormalizable four when @xmath365 .",
    "while this result would not hold order by order in perturbation theory , it does hold non - perturbatively if there is conformal invariance with anomalous dimensions , with the order by order feynman diagrams collectively organizing themselves non - perturbatively into the scaling form given in ( [ l51 ] ) . in ( [ m96 ] )",
    "we explicitly exhibit an analogous such non - perturbative organization for the bare mass @xmath9 .",
    "it is in this sense that the four - fermion interaction has been made renormalizable .",
    "thus once the point four - fermion vertices are dressed with a @xmath365 dressing , they are softened enough so as to lead to diagrams that are no more than logarithmically divergent .",
    "in essence , the point four - fermion vertex is spread out just enough to make it renormalizable ( @xmath480 , with dimensionless @xmath68 and @xmath481 with dimension of inverse length squared ) , just like the introduction of intermediate vector bosons also spreads the weak interaction point four - fermion vertex out just enough to make it renormalizable .    if now we do couple a four - fermion interaction to qed , the scalar and pseudoscalar channel fermion - antifermion scattering amplitudes are given by the iteration of these very same @xmath138 and @xmath139 green s functions as per the expression for @xmath482 given in ( [ l59 ] ) ( or its pseudoscalar and massive fermion analogs ) . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath68 is introduced by the hartree - fock method as per the gap equation ( [ l48 ] ) , the resulting @xmath482 , @xmath483 , @xmath484 , and @xmath271 are not merely softened to logarithmic by @xmath365 , they are actually finite . hence with critical scaling , with @xmath365 , and with a gap equation for @xmath70 , the ultraviolet behavior of the fermion - antifermion scattering amplitude is completely under control .",
    "the four - fermion theory scattering amplitude @xmath66 that results ( the observable quantity in the theory ) is then completely finite , with the cancellation of ultraviolet divergences expressly involving an interplay between short - distance and long - distance effects that is sensitive to the mass generation mechanism .",
    "thus the @xmath72 condition reduces the divergences in @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath87 to logarithmic , with the mass - generating infrared hartree - fock condition @xmath485 then leading to completely finite scattering amplitudes @xmath359 and @xmath271 .",
    "thus in the language of perturbation theory , critical scaling plus symmetry breaking uniquely fixes the needed counterterms .",
    "exactly the same set of cancellations is found to occur for @xmath124 as well . as evidenced in ( [ l50 ] )",
    ", the @xmath72 condition reduces the divergence in @xmath121 from quadratic to logarithmic , with the symmetry breaking then generating precisely the needed @xmath104 counterterm to make @xmath124 completely finite .",
    "welcome as this is , nonetheless , left out from this discussion is the vacuum energy density quartic divergence to which we had alluded before .",
    "and so it is to this issue that we now turn .",
    "there are two separate issues for the vacuum energy density .",
    "first , simply because a matter field energy - momentum tensor is composed of products of quantum fields at the same spacetime point , there is a zero - point problem .",
    "this problem already occurs in a massless theory with a normal vacuum . and second , when one generates mass via symmetry breaking , not only does the zero - point vacuum energy density change , in addition a cosmological constant term is produced .",
    "to illustrate the issues that are involved , it is convenient to first look at the vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath486 of a free fermion matter field of mass @xmath82 in flat , four - dimensional spacetime , with the fermion obeying the massless dirac equation . with @xmath487 where @xmath488 , following a feynman contour integration in the complex frequency plane the vacuum matrix element evaluates to @xmath489 with its @xmath490 structure @xmath491 has the generic form of a perfect fluid with a timelike fluid velocity vector @xmath492 , viz .",
    "@xmath493 where @xmath494 @xmath495 the zero - point energy density @xmath496 and the zero - point pressure @xmath497 are related by the tracelessness condition @xmath498 since @xmath499 .",
    "( we use @xmath500=(-1,1,1,1)$ ] here and in the discussion of gravity below . ) since @xmath497 is not equal to @xmath501 , the zero - point energy - momentum tensor does not have the form of a cosmological constant term , to underscore that fact that the zero - point problem is distinct from the cosmological constant problem .",
    "with both @xmath496 and @xmath497 being divergent , in terms of a 3-momentum cutoff @xmath502 the divergences can be parametrized as the quartic divergences @xmath503 cancellation of these mass - independent quartic divergences is readily achieved in supersymmetry since a massless boson loop has the opposite sign to a massless fermion loop .",
    "however , the situation changes once the fermion acquires mass . for a free massive fermion in",
    "flat spacetime with vacuum @xmath504 the form of the energy - momentum tensor remains unchanged but the dirac equation becomes that of a massive fermion .",
    "then , with @xmath505 , @xmath496 and @xmath497 now evaluate to @xmath506 and while @xmath507 is no longer zero , @xmath497 remains unequal to @xmath501 .",
    "in addition to the previous quartic divergence , in ( [ m104 ] ) we also encounter quadratic and logarithmic divergences .",
    "since both of these latter two divergences are mass dependent , they can not be canceled by an interplay between fermions and bosons unless the fermions and bosons are degenerate in mass . since no supersymmetric partners of the ordinary particles have been detected to date , we know that the masses of the superparticles are far from being degenerate with those of the ordinary particles , with supersymmetry thus leaving @xmath508 quadratically divergent .",
    "in fact the situation is similar to that met with an elementary scalar higgs field self - energy since it too has a quadratic divergence ( the contribution due to a fermion that is yukawa - coupled to the higgs scalar field is equal to the quantity @xmath151 given in ( [ l29 ] ) ) . and",
    "it too can only be canceled via supersymmetry if there is a superparticle in the same mass region as the higgs particle itself , and this appears not to be the case .",
    "finally , as regards the cosmological constant , as long as the supersymmetry is unbroken , the cosmological constant is zero .",
    "specifically , in a supersymmetric theory one has a generic anticommutator of the form @xmath509 , where the @xmath510 are grassmann supercharges and @xmath511 is the hamiltonian . if the supercharges annihilate @xmath207 ( viz .",
    "unbroken supersymmetry ) , then @xmath512 is zero , the energy of the vacuum is zero , and the cosmological constant is thus zero too .",
    "however if the grassmann charges do not annihilate the vacuum @xmath504 then @xmath513 is non - zero and a non - zero cosmological constant is induced , one whose magnitude would be as big as the supersymmetry breaking scale .",
    "since this scale is known to be no smaller than the largest currently accessible energy at the lhc , this would give a cosmological constant contribution to standard einstein - gravity based cosmology that would be at least 60 or so orders of magnitude larger than allowable by current hubble plot data .",
    "if the breaking of supersymmetry leads to uncanceled quadratic and logarithmic divergences in the vacuum energy density , then if one is not to appeal to supersymmetry one must not only seek some other mechanism to cancel the quadratic and logarithmic divergences in ( [ m104 ] ) , one must also seek some alternate way to cancel the quartic divergence as well . then",
    ", if the quartic divergence given in ( [ m104 ] ) is not to be canceled by a boson loop associated with a superparticle , then the only apparent remaining option is for it to be canceled by gravity itself , as the gravitational field @xmath514 is itself bosonic .",
    "and indeed in any quantum gravitational theory one would encounter products of gravitational fields , with quantum gravity thus having a zero - point problem of its own .",
    "now one can not make the needed cancellation using standard einstein gravity itself since it is not renormalizable at the quantum level .",
    "however , one can do so in conformal gravity since it is a consistent quantum theory , being renormalizable , unitary , and ghost free @xcite .    conformal gravity , which the present author first thought to consider because of his familiarity with conformal invariance and critical scaling in flat spacetime theories , assumes invariance under local conformal transformations of the form @xmath515 .",
    "the pure gravitational sector of the theory is then given by the weyl - tensor - based action ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath516 , \\label{m105}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath517 is a dimensionless gravitational coupling constant , with this action being the unique action that is locally conformal invariant in four spacetime dimensions .",
    "functional variation of this action with respect to the metric defines a gravitational tensor @xmath518 and a fourth - order derivative equation of motion of the form @xmath519 when the theory is coupled to a conformal invariant matter sector . if we define @xmath520 to be the energy - momentum tensor @xmath521 of gravity ( i.e. the variation with respect to the metric of the pure gravitational sector of the action ) , and introduce an energy - momentum tensor for the universe as a whole , we can rewrite ( [ m107 ] ) as @xmath522 to thus put the gravity and matter sectors on an equal footing , while showing that the total energy - momentum tensor of the universe is zero .",
    "given the conformal symmetry , no dimensionful parameters are allowed in the conformal action . thus both the einstein - hilbert action @xmath523 and a cosmological constant action @xmath524 are forbidden . thus just like supersymmetry , conformal symmetry forbids the presence of any fundamental cosmological constant at the level of the lagrangian .",
    "the actual quantization procedure for the conformal gravity theory is somewhat unusual since it can not follow the standard quantization prescription that is ordinarily used for fields .",
    "specifically , for a standard matter field one obtains its equation of motion by varying the matter action with respect to the matter field , but one obtains its energy - momentum tensor @xmath525 by instead varying the matter action with respect to the metric . since @xmath525 involves products of matter fields at the same point , a canonical quantization of the matter field then gives the matter energy - momentum tensor a non - vanishing zero - point contribution .",
    "however , in a standard quantization procedure for a given matter field , the non - vanishing of @xmath525 violates no constraint since one does not simultaneously impose the equation of motion of any other field .",
    "thus for a given matter field one does not require stationarity with respect to the metric , with @xmath525 thus not being constrained to vanish .",
    "and of course , if one does not couple to gravity , one can even normal order @xmath525 away .",
    "in contrast however , for gravity the relevant field is the metric itself , and the gravitational equation of motion is then given by @xmath526 , as @xmath527 is the variation with respect to the metric of the gravity sector action .",
    "then , with @xmath527 containing products of fields at the same point , a canonical quantization of the gravitational field would give a zero - point contribution to @xmath527 , and thus violate the stationarity condition @xmath526 that @xmath527 would have to obey .",
    "hence , unlike the matter fields for which there is no constraint on @xmath525 in the absence of any coupling of matter to gravity , gravity itself is always coupled to gravity , with its own stationarity condition not permitting it to consistently be quantized on its own .",
    "since @xmath527 will be non - zero if @xmath514 is a quantum field , one can not impose stationarity for @xmath527 on its own .",
    "rather , one must impose stationarity on the total @xmath528 , i.e. on @xmath529 .",
    "then , with @xmath530 already containing a zero - point contribution , the vanishing of @xmath529 requires that the gravity sector zero - point contribution precisely cancel that of the matter fields that it is coupled to .",
    "thus gravity can not be quantized in isolation but instead is quantized by virtue of its being coupled to a source that is quantized , with the coupling to the source fixing the normalization of the gravitational sector commutation relations .",
    "it is this interplay between the gravity and matter sectors that enables the gravity sector to take care of infinities in the matter sector , infinities such as the vacuum energy density and radiative - correction - induced anomalies of the type discussed below that arise because the regularization procedure involves the introduction of a scale symmetry breaking cutoff that would violate the conformal symmetry unless these anomalies are canceled .    to see how quantization of conformal gravity works in practice",
    ", we note that if we quantize the gravity sector of the conformal theory to lowest order in planck s constant around flat ( viz . the first quantum correction ) , in the expansion , and with the first non - trivial term being the term of order @xmath531 given in ( [ m111 ] ) . ] and take the vacuum expectation value of @xmath521 in the massless vacuum @xmath532 we obtain a quartically divergent zero - point energy density in the gravity sector of the form @xcite @xmath533 where @xmath534 is the as yet to be determined gravitational field wave function renormalization constant , as defined @xcite as the coefficient of the delta function in canonical commutation relations for the momentum modes of the gravitational field . inserting ( [ m111 ] ) and ( [ m103 ] ) into ( [ m108 ] ) then yields @xmath535 thus ,",
    "simultaneously we fix the gravity sector renormalization constant and effect a complete cancellation of the quartically divergent zero - point terms .",
    "moreover , we do not need to introduce any regulators to separately define either @xmath536 or @xmath537 , as each term regulates the other as needed to maintain the stationarity condition @xmath538 , with the cancellation being done mode by mode and not mode sum by mode sum .",
    "as long as ( [ m108 ] ) is maintained order by order in perturbation theory ( which it is since both the gravity and matter sectors are renormalizable when conformal ) , then the mode by mode cancellation will persist , with matrix elements of @xmath528 never having a zero - point problem .",
    "in addition , we note that we not only do not need to specify @xmath539 a priori , we actually can not in fact do so .",
    "rather , @xmath539 is determined entirely by the coupling of gravity to matter , with the quantization of matter enforcing the quantization of gravity since the condition @xmath540 is not consistent with ( [ m108 ] ) . to underscore that @xmath539",
    "can not be assigned independently but is determined by the structure of the matter source to which gravity is coupled , we note that if the gravitational source consists of @xmath111 massless gauge bosons and @xmath541 massless two - component fermions , the vanishing of @xmath542 then entails that @xmath543 @xcite , with gravity adjusting to whatever its source is .",
    "moreover , since we do not need to introduce any regulators we do not obtain any anomalies such as the trace anomaly ( absent any violations of the conformal symmetry the trace of the energy - momentum tensor is zero ) . specifically , while conformal invariance ward identities would be violated by trace anomalies in both @xmath536 and @xmath537 , the vanishing of @xmath542 is not a ward identity condition but a stationarity condition .",
    "since @xmath542 is thus anomaly free , anomalies in @xmath536 and @xmath537 must cancel each other identically , being able to do so because it is that very cancellation that fixes @xmath539 in the first place .",
    "moreover , since we can effect a mode by mode cancellation without needing to look for a regulated sum of modes by regulated sum of modes cancellation , we never have to deal with the trace anomaly at all , and can treat both @xmath521 and @xmath530 as continuing to retain the tracelessness required by conformal invariance .",
    "the conformal gravity cancellation of zero - point infinities described above is not quite the same as the supersymmetry cancellation , since that cancellation did not address the gravitational zero - point energy problem , to thus leave the issue open . to clarify the issue ,",
    "consider the second - order derivative einstein gravity equation of motion @xmath544 if ( [ m113 ] ) is to be an operator identity , then the two sides of it are to both be quantum - mechanical or to both be classical . however , since the gravity side is not well - defined quantum - mechanically , one takes it to be classical .",
    "but since the matter side is built out of quantum fields , the matter side is quantum - mechanical . to get",
    "round this one replaces ( [ m113 ] ) by a hybrid @xmath545 however , since the matter term in ( [ m114 ] ) has a zero - point problem , one must find a mechanism to cancel it , and must do so via the matter side alone .",
    "now while unbroken supersymmetry actually achieves this , as we noted above , broken supersymmetry does not .",
    "but since the gravity side of ( [ m114 ] ) is finite it can not be equal to something that is infinite .",
    "thus , in the literature one commonly ignores the fact that gravity is to couple to all forms of energy rather than only to energy differences , and subtracts off the zero - point infinity by hand and replaces ( [ m114 ] ) by @xmath546 thus in treating the contribution of the electron fermi sea to the stability of white dwarfs or in evaluating the contribution of the cosmic microwave background to cosmology , one uses an energy operator of the generic form @xmath547 , and then by hand discards the @xmath548 term . and",
    "then , after all this is done , the finite part of @xmath549 still has an uncanceled and as yet uncontrolled cosmological constant contribution that still needs to be dealt with .",
    "the present author is not aware of any formal derivation of ( [ m115 ] ) starting from a consistent quantum gravity theory , and notes that since it is ( [ m115 ] ) that is conventionally used in astrophysics and cosmology , it would not appear to yet be on a fully secure footing . ) where gravity is classical , any matter sector renormalization anomalies would have to be cancelled within the matter sector alone . accomplishing this perturbatively",
    "has proven to be very difficult .",
    "however a non - perturbative possibility has been identified in the literature @xcite , where it was noted that in qed the trace anomaly term is given by @xmath550 $ ] where @xmath541 denotes normal ordering , with the trace anomaly thus vanishing if the @xmath105 function is zero .",
    "in contrast , in the conformal gravity case , gravity itself plays a role in anomaly cancellation , with @xmath528 being anomaly free not just non - perturbatively , but with @xmath539 readjusting each time , it is anomaly free order by order in perturbation theory as well . ]    in the conformal case not only does the gravity sector zero point cancel the massless fermion quartic divergence , the gravitational zero point continues to cancel the matter sector zero - point contribution when the fermion acquires a mass since the gravity sector zero point readjusts .",
    "specifically , in the event of dynamical symmetry breaking , critical scaling and @xmath72 , one has to take matrix elements of ( [ m108 ] ) in the self - consistent , hartree - fock vacuum @xmath551 .",

    "the cancellation works no matter how big @xmath562 might be , and none of it is observable since it all occurs in the vacuum , i.e. it is due entirely to the occupied negative energy states in the dirac sea .",

    "also gravity sees this effect mode by mode , i.e. gravity mode by fermion mode .",
    "in contrast , if one uses ( [ m115 ] ) , then gravity sees an entire sum over fermion modes , which is one of the reasons why in the standard einstein theory the cosmological constant effect is so big . to summarize ,",
    "if one wants to take care of the cosmological constant problem , one has to take care of the zero - point problem , and when one has a renormalizable theory of gravity , via an interplay with gravity itself one is then able to do so .    now in order to able to effect ( [ m118 ] ) and ( [ m119 ] ) order by order in perturbation theory we need both the gravity and matter sectors to be renormalizable . for a gauge - theory - based matter sector",
    "renormalizability is standard , and for the four - fermion interaction that we need in the matter sector in order to control the matter vacuum energy density , renormalizability is realized via @xmath72 . as to the gravity sector",
    ", the renormalizability of conformal gravity has been established in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since the conformal gravity coupling constant @xmath517 is dimensionless , conformal gravity is power - counting renormalizable .",
    "specifically , with @xmath514 being dimensionless , in an expansion around flat spacetime of the dimension four quantity @xmath571 as a power series in a gravitational fluctuation @xmath572 , each term will contain @xmath573 a specific number of times together with exactly four derivatives since it is the derivatives that carry the dimension of the @xmath571 term .",
    "the term that is quadratic in @xmath573 will thus give a @xmath574 propagator , and each time we work to one more order in @xmath573 we add an extra @xmath574 propagator and a compensating factor of @xmath575 in the vertex . with equal numbers of powers of @xmath576 being added in numerator and denominator , the ultraviolet behavior is not modified , and renormalizability is thereby maintained . also we note that because of the @xmath577 factor no infrared divergence is generated by the @xmath574 propagator .",
    "additionally , as noted in @xcite , in euclidean space where all the eigenvalues of @xmath514 are real and positive , in the basis in which @xmath514 is diagonal the quantity @xmath571 then consists of a sum of terms each one of which is a positive definite square .",
    "consequently , on taking @xmath517 as defined in ( [ m105 ] ) to be positive , on every path the exponent in the path integral associated with the euclidean @xmath578 is negative definite ( @xmath579 ) .",
    "the euclidean path integral is thus well - defined , and the theory is renormalizable in the ultraviolet and finite in the infrared .",
    "however , one can not immediately conclude that the conformal gravity minkowski path integral is well - behaved too because of anomalies and a possible ghost / unitarity problem that fourth - order derivative theories have been thought to possess .",
    "we provided a resolution of the anomaly problem above , and turn now to a resolution of the ghost problem .",
    "our resolution of the ghost problem will enable us to obtain a well - defined minkowski path integral , one that will require a continuation of the metric into the complex plane .      as a quantum theory conformal gravity had long been known to be renormalizable ( @xmath580 being dimensionless ) , but being fourth order it had long been thought to possess negative norm ghost states that would violate unitarity .",
    "this view of conformal gravity is suggested by writing the massless fourth - order propagator @xmath574 as the @xmath581 limit @xmath582 . \\label{m120}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the second term in ( [ m120 ] ) having a negative coefficient one immediately anticipates that the theory has states with negative norm .",
    "however , from inspection of a c - number propagator alone one can not determine what quantum - mechanical green s function the propagator is to correspond to . for this one has to quantize the theory , construct the appropriate hilbert space ,",
    "identify appropriate asymptotic boundary conditions , and then construct the propagator .",
    "when bender and mannheim did this they found @xcite that the quantum hamiltonian was not hermitian , but that it instead was @xmath583 symmetric . even , the hamiltonian is actually @xmath584 symmetric , but for our purposes we will continue to discuss the theory from the @xmath583 perspective as that was how the work of @xcite was developed .",
    "more recently it has been shown that in general one should use @xmath584 rather than @xmath583 when considering hamiltonians that are not hermitian @xcite , though this does not affect the results of @xcite .",
    "] in such a situation the correct hilbert space norm is given by the overlap not of the right - eigenvectors of the hamiltonian with their dirac conjugates , viz .",
    "the dirac norm @xmath585 , but rather by the overlap of the right - eigenvectors of the hamiltonian with its left - eigenvectors , viz .",
    "@xmath586 , with the left - eigenvectors being related to the @xmath583 conjugates of the right - eigenvectors . and with the @xmath586 norm being found to be both finite and non - negative in the fourth - order case , when one uses the @xmath583-theory norm one can associate ( [ m120 ] ) with a unitary theory .",
    "( since with an appropriate operator @xmath587 , one can write @xmath588 and thus @xmath589 , it is through this @xmath587 that the minus sign in ( [ m120 ] ) is generated , rather than through properties of the states themselves . ) thus by recognizing conformal gravity to be a @xmath583 theory rather than a hermitian one , its unitarity can then be secured .",
    "in addition , with the @xmath590 prefactor in ( [ m120 ] ) actually blowing up in the @xmath581 limit , bender and mannheim found that @xmath581 limit was singular , with the hamiltonian associated with the pure @xmath574 propagator actually not being diagonalizable , but being of jordan - block form instead .",
    "since the hamiltonian is not diagonalizable , it manifestly could not be hermitian .",
    "thus the ghost problem in fourth - order theories only arose because one tried to treat the theory as though it was a hermitian theory and as though one could use the standard dirac norm .",
    "thus the apparent generation of negative dirac norm states indicates not that the theory violates conservation of probability , but that the hamiltonian is not hermitian and the dirac norm is not the appropriate norm .",
    "while the work of bender and mannheim has shown that one can construct a completely consistent quantum hilbert space for the conformal gravity theory ( which is all that matters ) , recently woodard has called these results into question @xcite by claiming that the construction that bender and mannheim used does not obey the correspondence principle or the usual understanding of the @xmath591 limit of canonical quantization .",
    "also woodard claims that the wave functions that bender and mannheim used were not normalizable .",
    "however , these claims are neither relevant nor correct . even though the conformal gravity theory does in fact obey the correspondence principle ( in the way we describe below ) , whether a theory may or may not obey the correspondence principle is not of concern to begin with , since the correspondence principle is neither a law of nature nor a complete guide as to what quantum theories are permissible , as the existence of half - integral spin for instance immediately makes manifest . and",
    "as to canonical quantization , even though it also is not a law of nature ( again witness half - integral spin ) , bender and mannheim did in fact quantize the theory canonically anyway , with poisson brackets being replaced by commutators in the usual way . what was not standard was that because the theory was a higher - derivative theory , the theory was a constrained theory , with the appropriate poisson bracket algebra needing to be constructed by the method of dirac constraints .",
    "and then , in order to produce a quantum - mechanical hamiltonian whose wave functions were indeed normalizable , one had to make an allowed but not ordinarily needed complex symplectic transformation on the poisson bracket algebra before canonical quantization .",
    "this complexification then removed the ostrogradski instability that the theory would otherwise have had . with this same complexification",
    ", the wave functions were then expressly shown to be normalizable .    to be more specific , we note first that when linearized around flat spacetime according to @xmath592 , through second order the weyl action given in ( [ m105 ] ) takes the form @xcite @xmath593 , where @xmath594 , and where the gauge has been chosen so that @xmath595 .",
    "since there are no cross - terms between components of @xmath596 in @xmath597 , we can treat each component of @xmath598 independently .",
    "moreover , since the spatial behavior is not important ( all that matters for dynamics is the temporal behavior ) , we can take the spatial dependence to be momentum modes with frequency @xmath599 . on now defining @xmath600",
    ", we can write the action in the @xmath601 sector as @xmath602 where we have set @xmath603 , to thus put the action in the form of the pais - uhlenbeck fourth - order oscillator theory @xcite . to see that we have lost none of the difficulties associated with conformal gravity theory ( the difficulties that were then addressed by bender and mannheim ) , we note that the propagator associated with this @xmath604 can immediately be shown @xcite to be of the generic form given in ( [ m120 ] ) .    noting that the @xmath604 action is a constrained action ( @xmath605 has to serve as the canonical conjugate of both @xmath606 and @xmath607 ) , mannheim and davidson @xcite replaced @xmath605 by an independent variable @xmath608 to give an action @xmath609 .",
    "given this action , they then constructed the hamiltonian for the theory by the method of dirac constraints , to obtain @xmath610 , where @xmath611 and @xmath612 are the respective poisson bracket conjugates of @xmath608 and @xmath606 .",
    "moreover , not only have we not as yet lost any of the difficulties of the quantum theory , the presence of the @xmath613 term in @xmath614 signals an ostrogradski instability in the classical theory , with @xmath614 being unbounded from below when @xmath615 is positive and @xmath606 is real .    however , bender and mannheim pointed out that to draw such a conclusion about the theory is too hasty , since there is no justification for taking @xmath606 to be real ( i.e. for taking @xmath596 to be real ) , since nothing in the classical poisson bracket algebra requires it .",
    "specifically , once one has a classical poisson bracket algebra , one can make symplectic transformations on it that preserve the poisson bracket algebra , and nothing restricts these transformations to being real .",
    "as long as they do preserve the poisson bracket algebra , they are fully allowed by classical physics .",
    "( some examples and discussion of complex symplectic transformations that preserve the classical poisson bracket algebra may be found in @xcite ) . now ordinarily ( i.e. in classical theories that have no ostrogradski instability ) , making such complex symplectic transformations has no effect on the theory , and is without any new content .",
    "however , things are different in the pais - uhlenbeck case , since as one transforms @xmath606 into the complex plane the asymptotic convergence properties of the theory can change .    to see what explicitly happens in the pais - uhlenbeck case ,",
    "it is very instructive to consider a path integration of the theory based on the @xmath604 action . to get the path integral to converge we follow the feynman rule of replacing @xmath616 by @xmath617 .",
    "as noted in @xcite , this then adds on to each path in the path integral a term of the form @xmath618 . while the path integral then converges for real @xmath608 it does not do so for real @xmath606 .",
    "the pais - uhlenbeck theory path integral thus does not exist if the path integral measure is real ( as is to be expected given the ostrogradski instability ) .",
    "however , it would exist if @xmath606 ( and thus its conjugate @xmath612 ) are taken to be pure imaginary ( in which case the problematic @xmath613 term then would be bounded from below , with @xmath614 containing no @xmath619 term that would then become problematic instead ) .",
    "if we divide the complex plane into regions in the shape of the letter @xmath620 , then convergence of the path integral is secured if we put the @xmath608 variable anywhere in the east or west quadrants of the letter @xmath620 in the complex @xmath608 plane ( regions that include the real @xmath608 axis ) , and if we put the @xmath606 variable anywhere in the north and south quadrants in the complex @xmath606 plane ( regions that include the pure imaginary @xmath606 axis ) .",
    "these various regions are known as stokes wedges , with the boundaries between them being known as stokes lines .",
    "thus for the pais - uhlenbeck oscillator , as we make complex symplectic transformations on the poisson brackets , in the @xmath621 sector we cross a stokes line while doing so , with the convergence properties of the theory then changing radically .",
    "on one side of the stokes line the theory has an ostrogradski instability , but on the other side it does not .",
    "now as noted in @xcite , as we make symplectic transformations on the classical poisson brackets we can simultaneously make similarity transformations through the same angles on the quantum commutators in the quantum theory , with the classical and quantum sectors tracking each other identically .",
    "moreover , it was noted in @xcite that in the quantum pais - uhlenbeck theory one only gets normalizable wave functions if one does indeed transform @xmath606 across a stokes line in the complex @xmath606 plane .",
    "thus it is only in the north or south quadrants in the complex @xmath606 plane that either the classical or the quantum theories exist , and in these quadrants both the classical and quantum theories are fully consistent , being free of any states with negative energy or any states with either infinite norm or negative norm @xcite .",
    "moreover , the quantization is completely canonical , with classical poisson brackets that are symplectically transformed through a given complex angle being replaced by quantum commentators that are similarity transformed through the same complex angles .",
    "thus in the north and south stokes wedges one does have a correspondence principle and one does have canonical quantization after all .    as regards the wave function renormalization issue ,",
    "we note additionally that if one were to try to associate the propagator given in ( [ m120 ] ) with an indefinite metric hilbert space , one would get non - normalizable wave functions , a fact noted by bender and mannheim in @xcite and also by woodard in @xcite . however , precisely because these wave functions are not normalizable , one is not free to quantize the theory with an indefinite metric , and that is what saves the theory , and is what led bender and mannheim to the correct stokes wedges in which one then could consistently quantize the theory with a @xmath583-theory norm that was both finite ( i.e. normalizable ) and non - negative .    to appreciate the point , we note that the commutator relation @xmath622=i\\hbar$ ] is left invariant under @xmath623 , @xmath624 .",
    "thus as well as the wave mechanics representation in which we set @xmath625 and @xmath626 , we can also represent the commutator by @xmath627 and @xmath628 .",
    "now the commutator has to act on functions @xmath629 , and we can write @xmath630\\psi(z)=i\\hbar \\psi(z)$ ] or we can write @xmath631\\psi(e^{i\\theta}z)=i\\hbar \\psi(e^{i\\theta}z)$ ] . both of these representations are only meaningful if the wave function is a good test function . in the pais - uhlenbeck case",
    "@xmath629 with real @xmath606 is not a good test function , and it is only on crossing a stokes line that one finds a domain in the complex plane where @xmath632 is normalizable , just as is needed .    now for gravity , it might initially appear strange that one could take the metric to be in a stokes wedge that would permit it to be pure imaginary rather than real .",
    "however , recalling that @xmath633 , we see that this relation is left unchanged if we replace @xmath634 by @xmath635 and replace @xmath636 by @xmath637 . moreover , since the levi - civita connection contains equal numbers of covariant and contravariant metric tensors , gravity is not sensitive to these replacements , with no gravity experiment to date ever having fixed the overall phase of the metric . since the riemann tensor @xmath638 with all four indices covariant has one more covariant @xmath514 than it has contravariant @xmath639 , under the replacement of @xmath634 by @xmath635 ,",
    "@xmath638 is replaced by @xmath640 . in consequence",
    "@xmath641 is replaced by @xmath642 . hence now ,",
    "as noted in @xcite , the euclidean path integral will be well - behaved if rather than be positive , @xmath517 is negative .",
    "hence it is not the euclidean theory with @xmath517 positive ( the case considered in @xcite , and also in @xcite in an analogous situation ) , but rather that with @xmath517 negative that has the good continuation to a ghost - free minkowski path integral .    in his paper woodard showed that it was impossible to fix the fourth - order gravity ostrogradski instability problem if the spacetime metric is kept real .",
    "however , rather than not consider the theory any further , one should first check to see if it would make sense if the metric is taken to be complex , since invariance of the poisson bracket algebra permits such a possibility . and",
    "as we have seen , the presence of a stokes line in the complex plane and a continuation across it is all that is needed in order to render the conformal gravity theory completely viable .    with conformal gravity thus being a consistent quantum theory of gravity , one expressly constructed in the four spacetime dimensions for which there is observational evidence , one does not need to resort to the string theory formulation of quantum gravity .",
    "thus one has no need for supersymmetry ( or for extra dimensions for that matter ) that are so key to string theory .",
    "also , since conformal gravity has no need to utilize the interplay between spacetime and the fermionic supercharges of supersymmetry that is central to string theory , it has no need to find a way to evade the coleman - mandula theorem that would forbid any such interplay for bosonic charges .",
    "moreover , if there is no supersymmetry in nature and if there are no extra dimensions , than rather than being a possible theory of everything , string theory would become a theory of more than everything , containing far more ingredients than there then would be absent supersymmetry and extra dimensions .",
    "the economical nature of conformal gravity as a quantum theory of gravity is that by not requiring extra dimensions or supersymmetry , it requires no new spacetime dimensions and requires no new elementary particles beyond those that are already known .",
    "if one takes the mean - field lagrangian and couples it to geometry , then just as in the one loop ( [ l23 ] ) where the mean - field order parameter was found to be coupled to an axial gauge field , on evaluating the analogous one loop fermion feynman diagram in an external gravitational field , one finds @xcite that ( cf .",
    "( [ m141 ] ) below ) the coupling in this case is that of a conformally coupled field , viz .",
    "however , since we are in a conformal theory , we can make a conformal transform that would bring @xmath136 in the effective higgs lagrangian of ( [ l56 ] ) to a constant .",
    "thus at @xmath644 , and with @xmath645 , when coupled to geometry the effective higgs lagrangian of ( [ l56 ] ) takes the form @xmath646 in its coupling to @xmath647 the ricci scalar appears with the opposite sign to the sign that appears in the einstein - hilbert action ( compare ( [ m109 ] ) and ( [ m141 ] ) below ) .",
    "this then leads to repulsive rather than attractive gravity . in the conformal",
    "theory attractive newtonian gravity arises not from this term but from the @xmath648 term @xcite .",
    "since the weyl tensor @xmath649 and the conformal gravitational tensor @xmath648 both vanish in geometries such as robertson - walker that are conformal to flat , @xmath648 plays no role in cosmology , to thus allow cosmological gravity to be repulsive and local gravity to be attractive .",
    "this fact was capitalized on in @xcite to show that a repulsive cosmological gravity would have no flatness problem . and",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the theory would have no horizon problem , and that in such a cosmology there would be some cosmic repulsion that would lower the current era value @xmath650 of the deceleration parameter with respect to its value in standard attractive gravity . specifically in @xcite it was shown that even without the @xmath562 term this would reduce @xmath650 from its pure matter inflationary universe value of @xmath651 to @xmath652 . when the cosmological term is included the matter energy - momentum tensor takes the form @xmath653 in ( [ m122 ] ) it is understood that , as discussed above , now only the positive frequency components of the fields are to appear , and not the full vacuum contribution  i.e. just the finite part of the energy - momentum tensor as given in ( [ m119 ] ) .",
    "then , no matter how big @xmath111 might be , it was shown @xcite that @xmath650 was obliged to lie in the narrow range @xmath654 , with the associated luminosity distance @xmath655 versus redshift @xmath606 relation being of the form @xmath656^{1/2}\\right ) , \\label{m123}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath165 is the current value of the hubble parameter . with @xmath657 , ( [ m123 ] )",
    "was found @xcite to provide every bit as good a fit to the accelerating universe data @xcite as the standard @xmath658 , @xmath659 paradigm .",
    "however the fit provided by ( [ m123 ] ) requires no dark matter or fine tuning at all , with the acceleration coming from the negative effective newton constant and the negative spatial curvature @xmath660 that conformal cosmology possesses .",
    "( more technically , it is not that dark matter is excluded , it is just that the contribution of any matter , dark or even luminous , to current hubble plot era cosmic evolution is highly suppressed in conformal cosmology . )",
    "moreover , conformal cosmology continues to be accelerating at higher redshift and thus requires none of the fine tuning that would make the standard cosmology only be accelerating at late redshifts .",
    "thus at higher redshift the hubble plots associated with conformal cosmology and standard cosmology will differ markedly , a potentially testable diagnostic . finally , we note that with there being no need for dark matter in conformal cosmology , there is no need for supersymmetry to provide any dark matter candidates ( not that supersymmetry is currently known to naturally lead to @xmath658 , or to @xmath659 for that matter when it does so ) .",
    "while the weyl tensor vanishes in geometries that are homogeneous and isotropic , as soon as one introduces localized sources the homogeneity is lost and @xmath661 of ( [ m106 ] ) is no longer zero . despite its somewhat formidable appearance mannheim and kazanas @xcite were able to determine its form exactly and to all orders in classical geometries that are only spherically symmetric about a single point . in particular",
    "they found that @xmath662 exactly obeys the fourth - order poisson equation @xmath663 the general solution to this equation is given by @xmath664 where @xmath665 obeys @xmath666 .",
    "since the integration in ( [ m125 ] ) extends all the way to @xmath667 , the @xmath668 potential receives contributions from material both inside and outside any system of interest . according to ( [ m125 ] )",
    ", a star of radius @xmath669 produces an exterior potential of the form @xmath670 per unit solar mass of star .",
    "we thus recover the newtonian potential while finding that the potential gets modified at large distances , i.e. at precisely the distances where one has to resort to dark matter . integrating the @xmath671 potential over a thin disk of stars with a surface brightness @xmath672 with scale length @xmath673 ( the typical configuration for the stars in a spiral galaxy ) yields the net local potential produced by the stars in the galaxy itself , and leads to a locally generated contribution to galactic circular velocities of the form @xcite @xmath674 } + \\frac{n^*\\gamma^ * c^2r^2}{2r_0}i_1\\left(\\frac{r}{2r_0}\\right ) k_1\\left(\\frac{r}{2r_0}\\right ) , \\label{m126}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath675 is the number of stars in the galaxy .",
    "there are two contributions due to material outside the galaxy , i.e. due to the rest of the universe .",
    "the first is a linear potential term with coefficient @xmath676 coming from cosmology ( associated with the @xmath665 term , and due to writing a comoving robertson - walker geometry with negative curvature in the rest frame coordinate system of the galaxy ) .",
    "the second arises from the integral from @xmath677 to @xmath678 term in ( [ m125 ] ) due to cosmological inhomogeneities such as clusters of galaxies , and is of a quadratic potential form with coefficient @xmath679 .",
    "when all these contributions are combined , the total circular velocities are given by @xmath680 mannheim and obrien @xcite have applied this formula to the rotation curves of a set of 141 different galaxies and found very good fitting with parameters @xmath681 with no dark matter being needed . thus even though there is only one free parameter per galaxy , viz .",
    "@xmath675 , a parameter that is common to all galactic rotation curve fits , and even though there is basically no flexibility , ( [ m127 ] ) fully captures the essence of the data .",
    "we should note that it was not the dark matter problem the first got the present author interested in conformal gravity .",
    "rather , it was because conformal gravity possessed a symmetry that forbade the presence of any the cosmological constant term at the level of the starting lagrangian @xcite",
    ". moreover , mannheim and kazanas set out with the quite limited objective of trying to see whether a theory that was not based on the einstein - hilbert action could still lead to a newtonian potential .",
    "it was only on solving the conformal gravity theory in a static , spherically symmetric geometry that they discovered that the theory not only did indeed support a newtonian potential , it was accompanied by a linear potential term that they had not anticipated . that this linear potential could then be used to eliminate the need for galactic dark matter is therefore quite non - trivial .",
    "we should also note that in contrast to the conformal gravity fits , dark matter fits to this same set of 141 galaxies requires 282 additional free parameters , viz .",
    "two free parameters for each galactic dark matter halo .",
    "now dark matter theory does provide generic forms for the shapes of the halos @xcite , but each halo has two free numerical parameters , parameters which for the moment have to be phenomenologically determined by the fitting itself .",
    "thus , with there being no need for dark matter in conformal gravity fits to galactic rotation curves , we again note that there is no need for supersymmetry to provide any dark matter candidates ( not that supersymmetry is anyway currently known to naturally lead to values for any of the 282 free halo parameters ) . finally , since both ( [ m123 ] ) and ( [ m127 ] ) do capture the essence of the astrophysical data to which they were applied , then , if supersymmetry , dark matter theory , and even string theory , are to be correct , they should be able to derive these formulas for themselves .",
    "we would also like to note that even if a supersymmetric particle is discovered at the lhc , this would not necessarily solve the dark matter problem .",
    "specifically , the so far unsuccessful underground dark matter searches have identified a fairly large exclusion zone in supersymmetric cross section versus supersymmetric mass plots . for any supersymmetric particles discovered at the lhc to be dark matter they would have to not fall in this exclusion zone , and would , of course , then have to be found in the allowed region .",
    "as regards conformal gravity , if it is to supplant dark matter then it will have to successfully describe astrophysical phenomena such as gravitational lensing and the anisotropy structure of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "the study of conformal cosmological fluctuation theory given in @xcite provides a first step in this direction .",
    "also , in this same paper a listing of the challenges that the conformal gravity theory currently faces may be found .      with string theory with its supersymmetric underpinnings being capable of addressing both a metrication of all the fundamental forces and a unification of them ,",
    "it is of interest to see how conformal symmetry fares on these issues where there is no supersymmetry to appeal to and no way to evade the constraints of the coleman - mandula theorem .",
    "we discuss first metrication , and we shall follow the recent discussion given in @xcite where the effects of some generalized geometric connections were considered .    in the presence of some generalized geometric connection @xmath682 where @xmath683 is the standard levi - civita connection @xmath684 one introduces a generalized spin connection of the form @xmath685 where the @xmath686 are vierbeins and @xmath687 is given by @xmath688 in terms of this generalized connection the dirac action for a massless fermion takes the form @xmath689 where @xmath690 and the @xmath691 refer to a fixed frame",
    ". conjugate .",
    "however , this will have no effect on the results presented here . ]",
    "consider now a @xmath692 of the form @xmath693 here @xmath694 is the antisymmetric cartan torsion tensor . with @xmath345 being a vector field ,",
    "the @xmath345-dependent connection term is essentially the connection first introduced by weyl , differing from it only through the presence of the additional factor of @xmath304 , a factor that enforces @xmath583 and @xmath584 symmetry and is crucial for metrication @xcite . following some algebra the insertion of the full @xmath695 into the dirac action",

    "thus through the use of the generalized spin connection we are able to provide a purely geometric origin for both vector and axial - vector gauge fields .    apart from possessing full local vector gauge symmetry [ @xmath699 , @xmath700 and full local axial - vector gauge symmetry [ @xmath701 , @xmath702 , the action in ( [ m134 ] ) has another local invariance , namely local conformal invariance , with it being left invariant under @xmath515 , @xmath703 , @xmath704 , @xmath705 , @xmath706 .",
    "( each of these local transformations has its own @xmath707 of course . ) in addition , as noted in @xcite , the action also possess two discrete symmetries , namely @xmath583 and @xmath584 symmetry , with the factor of @xmath304 in ( [ m133 ] ) being needed to secure these invariances for the @xmath345-dependent sector . in ( [ m133 ] ) , the @xmath345-dependent piece of the connection would not couple in the generalized dirac action at all . ]",
    "the extension to the non - abelian case is direct .",

    "it thus has a dual characterization ",
    "it can be generated via local gauge invariance or via a generalized geometric connection .    to obtain the form of the kinetic energy operator for the gauge fields and the metric we perform a path integration over the fermion fields ( equivalent to a one fermion loop feynman diagram ) using the above dirac action , to obtain an effective action whose leading term is @xmath720 + \\frac{1}{3}g_{\\mu\\nu}^ig^{\\mu\\nu}_i+\\frac{1}{3}s_{\\mu\\nu}^is^{\\mu\\nu}_i\\bigg { ] } , \\label{m137}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath721 is a log divergent constant .",

    "the reason for this is that a generalized riemann or weyl tensor built out of the generalized connection would not be locally conformal invariant , since neither @xmath723 nor @xmath724 transform at all under a local conformal transformation . hence the only",
    "allowed action in the pure geometric sector is that based on the weyl tensor as constructed from the standard levi - civita connection alone , with the fermion path integration with a conformal invariant dirac action having no choice but to produce it in ( [ m137 ] ) . ) from ( [ m136 ] ) by a one - loop feynman diagram , and since one can not change the hilbert space in perturbation theory , either the theories based on ( [ m136 ] ) and ( [ m137 ] ) both have ghosts or neither does . but",
    "( [ m136 ] ) is the standard ghost - free action used in particle physics all the time .",
    "hence the theory based on ( [ m137 ] ) must be ghost - free , something that was shown in @xcite to actually be the case . ]    moreover , now that we have established the generic form needed for the gauge and metric sectors of the theory , and have seen that in this sector there are no cross - terms between any of the various connections in @xmath725 , we now augment the dirac action with a fundamental yang - mills gauge field ( @xmath726 ) action and a conformal ( @xmath727 ) metric sector action of the form @xmath728}. \\label{m138}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this action not only respects full conformal and gauge symmetry , like @xmath698 it has a dual characterization  it can be generated via local gauge invariance or via a generalized geometric connection . finally , on adding an @xmath708 invariant four - fermion action @xmath729 } , \\label{m139}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with coupling @xmath730 , we can write down the fundamental action for a conformal invariant universe , viz . @xmath731 if the dynamics associated with ( [ m140 ] ) leads to critical scaling and an @xmath732 with dynamical dimension equal to four , the @xmath733 action will then provide a fully renormalizable and consistent action for the universe in which all mass is generated in the vacuum by dynamical symmetry breaking .",
    "in addition , we noted that since ( [ m136 ] ) is the standard action used in physics , the effective action given in ( [ m137 ] ) must always appear in particle physics at the one fermion loop level .",
    "now , as noted in @xcite , radiative loops due to other standard fields such as scalars and gauge bosons yield a log divergence of the same sign , and thus the fermionically - generated @xmath135 could not be canceled by other fundamental fields .",
    "the infinity in ( [ m137 ] ) is thus an infinity that supersymmetry could not cancel .",
    "however , this infinity could be canceled via conformal invariance , and this can be done in two ways .",
    "specifically , since @xmath734 is fully renormalizable , one could cancel the @xmath721 term directly by a renormalization counterterm .",
    "however , the @xmath721 term could also be cancelled non - perturbatively if there is critical scaling .",
    "specifically , we recall that , unlike the scalar @xmath475 , in quantum electrodynamics higher - order radiative corrections to the vacuum polarization @xmath735 do not generate higher powers of @xmath736 , but are all equally linear in @xmath736 . with the short - distance behavior of the theory being conformal invariant",
    ", one can write ( see e.g. @xcite ) the short - distance vacuum polarization as the dimension six quantity @xmath737/4\\pi^4x^8=f(\\alpha)(\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}\\partial_{\\alpha}\\partial^{\\alpha}-\\partial_{\\mu}\\partial_{\\nu})(1/12\\pi^4x^4)$ ] , where @xmath738 is a power series in @xmath11 .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath739 yields just a single @xmath736 divergence .",
    "hence , if the respective coefficients of all the perturbative @xmath736 terms sum to zero ( viz .",
    "@xmath740 ) , this divergence will be canceled completely .",
    "the condition that the coefficients do sum to zero requires the coupling constant to be a solution to the gell - mann - low eigenvalue condition , viz . the critical scaling condition . and",
    "indeed this is precisely how johnson , baker , and willey were able to make @xmath8 finite .",
    "thus in the language of perturbation theory , critical scaling uniquely fixes the needed counterterm .",
    "now while the same analysis would equally apply if there is critical scaling in the axial - vector sector , we have not made a similar analysis for conformal gravity .",
    "however , we note that the generation of ( [ m137 ] ) from ( [ m136 ] ) involves matrix elements of fermion loops not with scalar insertions of fermion bilinears but with vector , axial - vector and tensor insertions instead . now",
    "all of these particular insertions are associated with conservation conditions , and it is thus plausible that the cancellation would hold for conformal gravity too .",
    "then , should it indeed hold , the dynamics associated with @xmath733 would not only be renormalizable , non - perturbatively it would even be completely finite .    moreover , if one goes further and even breaks the conformal invariance by adding a spacetime - dependent mass term @xmath741 to the dirac action , the above @xmath135 remains intact while being augmented by the `` mean - field '' action @xcite , @xcite @xmath742}. \\label{m141}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath721 is the same log divergent constant as before , with two last terms in ( [ m141 ] ) needing to appear jointly in order to maintain local conformal invariance .",
    "again , it does not appear possible for supersymmetry to cancel this infinity as the superpartners are not degenerate with the regular particles . however , as noted above , with critical scaling and @xmath743 , the infinity in @xmath108 will be canceled .",
    "now while it is nice to obtain an action such as ( [ m138 ] ) , as given it could not describe the real world since there are no massless axial photons .",
    "the axial symmetry thus must be broken spontaneously , and as we have shown in this paper , that is precisely what critical scaling does when @xmath72 . thus starting from a generalized @xmath708 invariant torsion connection",
    "we are led not only to axial - vector gauge bosons , with the non - abelian equivalent of @xmath72 we automatically break the associated axial symmetries dynamically .",
    "similarly , since there is only one massless photon and eight massless qcd gauge bosons , any vector symmetries other than @xmath744 must be spontaneously broken also , with ( [ m138 ] ) then being augmented by the mean - field terms that accompany the associated dynamical mass generation .    the extension of our ideas to grand unified theories of the strong , electromagnetic and weak interactions is direct since one could endow a generalized connection with all of the needed internal quantum numbers , while not generating any quantum number dependence in the pure metric sector as it is automatically based on the levi - civita connection alone .",
    "there is however a caveat .",
    "the conformal group that underlies conformal invariance is @xmath745 and its covering group is @xmath746 .",
    "the fundamental representation of @xmath746 is a 4-dimensional spinor representation .",
    "thus , in a conformal invariant world all fermions must be four - component , with there thus having to be right - handed neutrinos and not just left - handed ones .",
    "intriguingly , the need for right - handed neutrinos is precisely what we had noted earlier .",
    "families of quarks and leptons must thus contain 16 fundamental two - component spinors and not just 15 .",
    "hence the smallest grand unified group allowed would be the anomaly - free @xmath747 , with its fundamental spinor representation being 16-dimensional .",
    "intriguingly , @xmath747 contains the chiral weak interaction group @xmath748 , the need for which we had also noted earlier .",
    "if one is to have a chance to achieve coupling constant unification without supersymmetry , one needs some reasonably low lying mass scale beyond those of the standard @xmath1 .",
    "depending on how it is broken the grand unified group could provide such a scale , though we should note that the @xmath2 data of @xcite leave little room for any physics beyond the standard model of any description at current energies .",
    "however , we should also note that this whole issue would be moot if the renormalized coupling constant of the grand unified group is itself at a renormalization group fixed point away from the origin .",
    "however , the coupling constants would be able to depend on the running scale if the theory has a non - trivial fixed point for some value of the coupling constant other than the physical one , with the theory tracking to the origin at high energies because of its asymptotic freedom , while tracking to the non - trivial fixed point and spontaneously breaking the symmetry in the infrared .",
    "( an alternate possibility was noted in @xcite  when @xmath749 the fluctuations produced by the renormalizable four - fermion residual interaction are themselves asymptotically free . )    without supercharges one is constrained by the coleman - mandula theorem , and so one could not unify the strong , electromagnetic and weak interactions with gravity by embedding spacetime and internal symmetries in a common lie algebra .",
    "however , with conformal invariance there is an alternate way to extend unification to include gravity as well . specifically , with fermions being in the fundamental representation of the conformal group ,",
    "consider some general complex transformation on a fermion of the form @xmath750 , with only @xmath751 carrying internal quantum numbers .",
    "then gauging @xmath751 gives yang - mills while gauging @xmath752 gives conformal gravity .",
    "thus starting from the kinetic energy of a free massless fermion in flat spacetime , on imposing all these local gaugings we obtain none other than the dirac action given in ( [ m136 ] ) . hence while yang - mills theories are obtained by gauging the imaginary part of the phase of the fermion field , gravity is obtained by gauging its real part . in this way spacetime and gravity can be unified , with it being ( [ m140 ] ) that should be considered as the fundamental action for physics , an action that can be obtained either by local gauging or by geometry , an action that could serve as a candidate theory of everything .",
    "in this paper we have presented arguments to show that conformal invariance can do as well as supersymmetry in addressing some key concerns in particle physics .",
    "we thus advocate that conformal symmetry be regarded as a symmetry that is every bit as fundamental to physics as lorentz invariance and poincare invariance . specifically , conformal symmetry is the full symmetry of the light cone , and in the absence of mass all particles must move on the light cone , with conformal symmetry thus being an exact symmetry at the level of the lagrangian if all mass generation is to come solely from the vacuum . in @xcite",
    "we have made the case for local conformal gravity , while in @xcite t hooft has made the case for local conformal symmetry .",
    "moreover , we noted above that the action given in ( [ m136 ] ) is locally conformal invariant , and that a fermion path integration automatically generates the conformal gravity action .",
    "however , the action given in ( [ m136 ] ) is the standard fermion action that is used in particle physics .",
    "thus both conformal invariance and conformal gravity can not be avoided , and must play some role in physics .    in this paper",
    "we have shown that conformal gravity can address the quantum gravity , the cosmological constant , and the dark matter problems .",
    "that one theory can address three problems might seem surprising .",
    "however , all of these problems have a common origin , namely the extrapolation of the standard einstein equations beyond their solar system origins . specifically , if we extrapolate the einstein equations to galactic distances and beyond we get the dark matter problem , if we extrapolate to cosmology we get the cosmological constant problem , and if we quantize the theory and extrapolate to short distances far off the mass shell we get renormalization and zero - point problems .",
    "since all of these problems have a common origin , they can equally have a common solution , with conformal gravity potentially being that solution since it provides a very different extrapolation .",
    "when the present author in the 1970s found that one could make the four - fermion interaction renormalizable via dynamical dimensions , it appeared to have the potential to provide a solution to the four - fermion theory of weak interactions that would be an alternative to the spontaneously broken gauge theory solution .",
    "however , now we see that when yang - mills theories are coupled to gravity , we need both , namely we need yang - mills for scattering amplitudes and we need a renormalizable four - fermion interaction for the vacuum energy density .",
    "then , when we interplay the two , with critical scaling we find that we can generate dynamical goldstone and dynamical higgs bosons , just as needed for a spontaneously broken gauge theory of weak interactions , with there being no need for any elementary higgs fields at all .",

    "<S> we can augment the theory with a then renormalizable four - fermion interaction with dynamical dimension equal to four , and can reinterpret the theory as a renormalizable version of the nambu - jona - lasinio model , with the gauge theory sector with its now massive fermion being a mean - field theory and the four - fermion interaction being the residual interaction . </S>",
    "<S> it is this residual interaction and not the mean field that then generates dynamical goldstone and higgs states , states that , as noted by baker and johnson , the gauge theory sector itself does not possess . </S>",
    "<S> the higgs boson is found to be a narrow resonance just above threshold , with its width potentially being a diagnostic that could distinguish a dynamical higgs boson from an elementary one . </S>",
    "<S> we couple the theory to a gravity theory , conformal gravity , that is equally conformal invariant , with the interplay between conformal gravity and the four - fermion interaction taking care of the vacuum energy problem . with conformal gravity being a unitary and renormalizable quantum theory of gravity </S>",
    "<S> there is no need for string theory with its supersymmetric underpinnings . with the vacuum energy problem </S>",
    "<S> being resolved and with conformal gravity fits to phenomena such as galactic rotation curves and the accelerating universe not needing dark matter , there is no need to introduce supersymmetry for either the vacuum energy problem or to provide a potential dark matter candidate . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that it is conformal symmetry rather than supersymmetry that is fundamental , with the theory of nature being a locally conformal , locally gauge invariant , non - abelian nambu - jona - lasinio theory . </S>"
