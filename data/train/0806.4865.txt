    "r0.42    a significant fraction of @xmath0 collisions at the lhc will involve ( quasi - real ) photon interactions , at center - of - mass ( c.m.s ) energies well beyond the electroweak energy scale .",
    "hence , the lhc can to some extend be considered as a high - energy photon - photon or photon - proton collider .",
    "the equivalent photon approximation ( epa ) can be successfully used to describe the majority of processes involving photon exchange , provided that the amplitude of a given process can be factorised into the photon exchange and interaction parts  @xcite . the photon - photon and photon - proton cross sections , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , must be convoluted with the photon spectra @xmath3 to obtain the @xmath0 cross sections .",
    "this paper considers the low pile - up conditions available at start - up and focuses on the irreducible backgrounds to the presented analyses .",
    "deeper studies involving inclusive background will be the object of later communications .",
    "many @xmath4 cross sections at the lhc are sufficiently large to yield interesting measurements ( see figure [ fig : gammagammaxsec ] ) . in particular , the expected high statistics for exclusive @xmath5  pair production should allow precise measurement of the @xmath6 quartic couplings .",
    "the existence of new massive charged particles can also be probed using the two - photon pair production .",
    "the particular case of super - symmetric pairs is considered here . moreover",
    ", the two - photon exclusive production of muon pairs will be an excellent luminosity monitoring tool  @xcite .",
    "two - photon exclusive production of muon pairs at the lhc has a well known cross section , and requires very small hadronic corrections .",
    "small theoretical uncertainties and a large cross section ( @xmath7  pb at lhc energies ) makes it a perfect candidate for the lhc absolute luminosity measurement @xcite .",
    "the selection procedure is very simple : two opposite charge muons within the central detector acceptance ( @xmath8 ) , with transverse momenta above some low thresholds ( @xmath9 or @xmath10  gev ) . requiring one proton tagged would yield @xmath11 muon pairs detected in a @xmath12 h run at the average luminosity of @xmath13 , allowing run by run calibration of the very forward detectors ( vfd ) .",
    "two - photon production of @xmath5 boson pairs provides a unique opportunity to investigate anomalous gauge boson couplings , in particular the quartic gauge couplings ( qgc ) @xmath6 . for 1  @xmath14 , the obtained limits of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , respectively , are about 10,000 times better than the best limits established at lep2 @xcite clearly showing large and unique potential of such studies at the lhc . the unique signature with large lepton acoplanarity ( and large missing transverse momentum )",
    "drastically reduces the backgrounds .",
    "r0.42    the interest in the two - photon exclusive production of pairs of new charged particles is three - fold : it provides a new , complementary and very simple production mechanism ; constraints on the masses of new particles could be obtained using double vfd tagged events ; finally , final states involving super - symmetric particles are usually produced without cascade decays .",
    "the fully leptonic final state consists of two acoplanar charged leptons and large missing energy has low background .",
    "the corresponding feynman diagrams are shown at figure [ fig.diag.susy ] .",
    "the only irreducible background for this type of processes is the exclusive @xmath5 pair production . indeed",
    ", direct lepton pairs @xmath23 can be suppressed using large acoplanarity cuts .",
    "discovery of super - symmetry via @xmath24 interaction is _ a priori _ difficult because of production cross sections smaller than 1  @xmath25 before acceptance cuts .",
    "however , the measured energy of the two scattered protons in vfds could allow for the distinction between various contributions to the photon - photon invariant mass @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the high luminosity and the high c.m.s .",
    "energy of photo - production processes at lhc offer interesting possibilities for the study of electroweak interaction and for searches beyond the standard model ( bsm ) up to the tev scale .",
    "the cross sections for various electroweak and bsm reactions together with their irreducible ( standard model ) background processes are shown in figure [ fig : gammapartonxsec ] .",
    "several processes have been studied in detail to illustrate the discovery potential of photo - production at lhc .",
    "in contrast to photon - photon reactions , the photo - production processes involve topologies with hard jets in the final state .",
    "the effect of jet algorithms and the efficiency of event selection was taken into account using a fast simulation of a typical multipurpose lhc detector response @xcite .",
    "the associated @xmath27 photo - production cross section reaches 23  @xmath25 for a 115  gev higgs boson and 17.5  @xmath25 for a 170  gev higgs boson .",
    "it represents more than @xmath28 of the total inclusive @xmath27 production at the lhc .",
    "r0.45        when the decay branching ratio of the higgs boson into a @xmath5 pair becomes dominant , the same sign lepton signature coming from leptonic decays of two out of the three produced @xmath5 seems promising .",
    "it has a signal to noise ratio of about one , which is unique at lhc .",
    "an integrated luminosity of a few tens of inverse femptobarns could directly reveal the @xmath29 gauge coupling .",
    "the @xmath30 coupling , very challenging to assess in parton - parton processes , could be probed for a light higgs boson if sufficient integrated luminosity without pile - up can be collected .",
    "photo - production of single top is dominated by t - channel amplitudes when the top quark is produced in association with a @xmath5 boson .",
    "in contrast to proton - proton deep inelastic scattering where the ratio of @xmath31 associated production cross section to the sum of all top production cross sections is only about @xmath32 , it is about 10 times higher in photo - production as illustrated in table [ vistop ] . this provides a unique opportunity to study this reaction at the start phase of lhc .",
    "cross sections after the application of acceptance cuts are shown in table [ xsec_visible ] .",
    "for the signal , a value of 0.1 was chosen for @xmath33 while @xmath34 was set at zero .",
    "the resolved @xmath35 is negligible .",

    "preliminary studies show that the di - leptonic channel could be competitive with the inclusive channel as detailed in @xcite .",
    "single top photoproduction could reveal phenomena beyond the standard model , and in particular flavour changing neutral currents ( fcnc)@xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangian for this anomalous coupling can be written as @xcite : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is defined as @xmath47 , @xmath48 being the photon 4-vector and @xmath49 an arbitrary scale , conventionally taken as the top mass .",
