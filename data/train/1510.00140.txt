    "thus , by observation  [ obs : clauses](i ) , staller can ensure three moves are played in @xmath91 and this makes a total of @xmath109 moves .",
    "we now consider the case we postponed , when dominator  tries to make a sequence of at least two moves that correspond to setting a variable true in the pos - cnf game while staller  did not have the opportunity to set a variable false .",
    "we thus are in the situation when dominator  played @xmath87 or @xmath107 as the first move in a widget subgraph @xmath58 , forcing an answer of staller  on @xmath111",
    ". then , possibly after some neutral sequences , dominator  sets another variable true .",
    "if he does so by playing a third move in a widget subgraph @xmath105 where a neutral sequence was played before , then , following observation  [ obs : widget](iii ) , staller  replies in @xmath58 to enforce four moves in that widget and we get at least @xmath109 moves in total .",
    "otherwise dominator  set another variable true playing @xmath116 or @xmath117 as the first move in another widget subgraph @xmath105 .",
    "then staller  must reply in @xmath105 to ensure three moves will be played in that widget , but we claim she can enforce four moves either in @xmath58 or in @xmath105 . indeed , whenever dominator  will make a move which is not the first move in a widget subgraph ( it may be a third move that finishes dominating @xmath58 or @xmath105 but not both ) , then staller  can ensure four moves are played in @xmath105 or @xmath58 . this concludes the proof .",
    "@xmath69    from lemma  [ lem : d - win ] and [ lem : s - win ] , we can infer the following .",
    "[ cor : main ] player 1 has a winning strategy for a formula @xmath37 in the pos - cnf game if and only if @xmath119 .",
    "we now use the reduction from the pos - cnf game to game domination problem as presented in lemmas  [ lem : d - win ] and  [ lem : s - win ] to prove our main theorem .",

    "[ t : main ]    * proof .",

    "first add a variable @xmath120 and modify @xmath75 into a formula @xmath121 in such a way that variable @xmath120 is inserted into every clause .",
    "now take the corresponding graph @xmath122 where @xmath123 contains the vertices @xmath124 for all variables @xmath70 ( including @xmath120 ) .",
    "add to @xmath125 ( where @xmath123 is no longer dominated ) a star @xmath126 with center @xmath7 , and add an edge between @xmath7 and each vertex in @xmath123 ; we denote the resulting graph by @xmath127 .",
    "the number of all variables ( together with @xmath120 ) is @xmath128",
    ".    * claim . *",
    "@xmath129 if and only if player  1 wins the pos - cnf game on @xmath75 .",
    "* proof of claim . *",
    "first we prove that @xmath7 is an optimal first move of dominator , and an optimal response of staller  is @xmath130 .",
    "suppose that dominator  does not play @xmath7 as his first move .",
    "then the response of staller  is to play one of the leaves adjacent to @xmath7 .",
    "if the next move of dominator  is to play @xmath7 , then by the basic strategy of staller  as presented in the proof of lemma  [ lem : s - win ] there will still be at least three moves played in each of the widget subgraphs and at least two moves in @xmath91 .",
    "altogether this yields @xmath131 moves in the game .",
    "if , on the other hand , the second move of dominator  is again not playing @xmath7 , staller  again responds by playing an undominated leaf . in this way",
    ", dominator  could gain an advantage by dominating one of the widget subgraphs in only two moves , however the advantage is lost by staller s second move on the leaf , which again yields @xmath132 moves , if dominator s third move is playing @xmath7 .",
    "otherwise , if dominator s third move is not playing @xmath7 , staller  goes with her basic strategy .",
    "she can ensure at most one widget subgraph ends up with only two moves played , and a third move is required to dominate the third leaf .",
    "then the total number of moves is @xmath103 on the widget subgraphs , two for @xmath82 and three on the @xmath126 , which makes @xmath132 .",
    "we derive that if dominator  does not play @xmath7 as his first move , there is no way that the number of moves would be less than @xmath132 .",
    "so we may assume that dominator  plays @xmath7 as his first move .",
    "if staller does not respond by playing @xmath130 , then in the next move dominator  can play @xmath133 , by which @xmath77 is dominated . using the same strategy as in lemma  [ lem : d - win ] , dominator",
    "can ensure that at most three moves are played in each widget subgraph , and since @xmath77 is dominated , two moves suffice for @xmath91 .",
    "altogether this sums up to at most @xmath134 moves , which means that staller s second move must be @xmath130 , if she wishes to have a chance to enforce more than @xmath134 moves .",
    "now , from @xmath135 , we derive that all vertices of @xmath123 are dominated , that the ( artificial ) variable @xmath120 is set false , and two additional moves in @xmath136 will be played , none of which is @xmath133 nor @xmath137 ( if dominator  played one of these two vertices , staller  can enforce four moves on the widget subgraph , by observation  [ obs : widget](v ) ) .",
    "the rest of the game thus corresponds to the game as in the proof of lemmas  [ lem : d - win ] and  [ lem : s - win ] , in which there are at most @xmath103 moves if and only if player  1 wins the pos - cnf game .",
    "together with four additional moves ( one playing @xmath7 and three in @xmath136 ) , we deduce that @xmath129 if and only if player  1 wins the pos - cnf game on @xmath75 .",
    "*  @xmath69(claim ) *    finally , observe that the reduction from pos - cnf to game domination problem can be computed with a working space of size @xmath138 ; giving an explicit algorithm is a routine work .",
    "recalling that pos - cnf is log - complete in pspace  @xcite completes the proof .",
    "we can modify the reduction from the proof to apply it for the pspace - completeness of the staller - start game domination problem , which can be done in a similar way as in the proof of theorem  [ t : main ] .",
    "given a formula @xmath75 , we consider the formula @xmath121 , where we add a variable @xmath120 that we insert into every clause . clearly ,",
    "if player  2 starts the pos - cnf game on @xmath121 , he must set variable @xmath120 false as his first move to have a chance to win .",
    "then , the winner of the pos - cnf game on the formula @xmath121 where player  2 starts , is the same as the winner of the pos - cnf game on @xmath75 . using this knowledge",
    ", it is straightforward to use the above reduction for the staller - start domination game .",
    "a related problem is to try to find families of graphs where the game domination number can be computed efficiently .",
    "such families obviously include those where the exact formula is known ( as already mentioned , these include paths , cycles and combs ) .",
    "another family where we expect the domination game number can be computed in polynomial time is the class of proper interval graphs . for these graphs ,",
    "it looks like both players strategy can be described by a greedy algorithm , though we did not manage to prove it .",
    "hence we pose :    [ prob : interval ] can the game domination number of ( proper ) interval graphs be computed in polynomial time ?    in particular , interval graphs are also dually chordal graphs , which are proven in  @xcite to be the so - called no - minus graphs ( that is , the graphs @xmath5 for which for all subsets of vertices @xmath139 , @xmath140 ) . in that paper , stronger relations between the game domination number of the disjoint union of two graphs and the game domination number of the components are given for no - minus graphs , which could prove useful in question  [ prob : interval ] .",
    "on the other hand , it seems likely that the decision problem remains pspace - complete even when restricted to split graphs , which are also proven to be no - minus in  @xcite .",
    "note that this would be a similar dichotomy as proved in  @xcite for the role assignment problem which can be solved in polynomial time on proper interval graph and is graph isomorphism - hard on chordal graphs .",
    "observe that the domination game on split graphs transposes to a game on hypergraphs where dominator chooses edges and staller chooses vertices ( not chosen before nor belonging to a chosen edge ) , and the game ends after all vertices either are chosen or belong to a chosen edge .",
    "the aim of dominator is again to finish the game as soon as possible , while staller tries to have the game last for as long as possible .",
    "the game where both players must choose hyperedges may be of independent interest .",
