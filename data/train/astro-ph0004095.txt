    "the star formation histories of elliptical galaxies , once thought to be very simple  old and metal - rich ( @xcite)have come under increasing scrutiny in the last three decades ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , 1977 ; @xcite , 1980 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , 1998 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "currently there are two basic models for elliptical galaxy formation : hierarchical clustering of small objects into larger galaxy - sized units with accompanying star formation over time ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , versus monolithic collapse and star formation in a nearly coeval single early burst ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "measurements of the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and spectral features of elliptical galaxies can provide a test of these scenarios .",
    "for example , evidence for substantial intermediate - age stellar populations ( between 1 and 10 gyr ) might favor hierarchical models , which more naturally have extended star formation over time .",
    "a goal of the present series is to assess the evidence for such intermediate - age populations .    the first paper of this series ( @xcite , hereafter paper i ) used lick absorption - line strengths for a sample of local elliptical galaxies observed by gonzlez ( 1993 , hereafter g93 ) to derive single - stellar - population ( ssp ) equivalent parameters @xmath0 ( age ) , @xmath1}$](metallicity ) , and @xmath2}$ ]  ( `` enhancement ratio , '' see below ) .",
    "single - burst model line - strengths by worthey ( 1994 , hereafter w94 ) were corrected for the effect of non - solar abundance ratios using theoretical spectral calculations by tripicco & bell ( 1995 , hereafter tb95 ) .",
    "the resultant ssp ages cover a range of 1 to 18 gyr ( including observational errors ) , while the ranges in @xmath1}$ ]  and @xmath2}$ ]  are fairly narrow .",
    "these parameters , particularly the ages , are based on the assumption that @xmath10  faithfully traces the mean temperature of the main - sequence turnoff and is not seriously affected by other hot stellar populations .",
    "evidence supporting this assumption was presented in paper i.    in deriving single - burst ssp parameters for elliptical galaxies , we do not mean to imply that their star formation histories were actually single bursts .",
    "in fact , our favored `` frosting '' model ( section  [ sec : disc_plane ] ) involves adding a minority of young stars to an older base population .",
    "our use of ssp parameters is simply a convenient way of condensing all the presently measured line strength data into just three numbers : light - weighted age , @xmath1}$ ] , and @xmath2}$ ] . for the moment , that is all the observations allow .",
    "it is our hope that ssp parameters will be adopted by those who model the full evolutionary history of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and that they will serve as as a convenient meeting ground between models and data .",
    "we show below that , even though ssp parameters are heavily influenced by the light of any young stars that may be present , modeling them still places important constraints on the total history of star formation in ellipticals .",
    "this paper explores the central stellar populations of a sample of local elliptical galaxies and develops correlations among them and with parent - galaxy structural parameters .",
    "many previous works have studied such correlations , but most have focused on _ raw _ line strengths . only three other studies , to our knowledge , have measured ages ( using balmer lines ) and developed correlations based on underlying stellar populations .",
    "tantalo , chiosi & bressan ( 1998 ) studied the g93 galaxies using models based on the `` padua '' isochrones .",
    "their correction for non - solar abundance ratios was approximate , however , leading to systematic errors in derived age , @xmath1}$ ] , and @xmath2}$ ]  ( paper i ) .",
    "kuntschner ( 1999 ) studied ellipticals in fornax using high - quality data , which we add to our sample here .",
    "he found that fornax ellipticals were mainly old , and also discovered a strong relation between @xmath2}$ ]  and @xmath5 , which we confirm .",
    "jrgensen ( 1999 ) studied coma ellipticals using line - strength models by vazdekis et al .",
    "her conclusions foreshadow ours in many respects , but some seem in retrospect to be the product of observational errors .",
    "all three of these papers are discussed in section  [ sec : sum_compare ] .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "a brief review of the g93 and kuntschner ( 1999 ) samples , line - strength data , ssp - equivalent stellar population parameters , and structural parameters is given in section  [ sec : data ] .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] presents the sample distribution in the four - dimensional space spanned by @xmath1}$ ] , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath2}$ ] ; this proves to be a highly flattened , two - dimensional `` hyperplane '' that in turn consists of two sub - relations , a `` @xmath6-plane , '' plus a linear @xmath2}$]@xmath5 relation .",
    "section  [ sec : other_views ] shows how projections of this hyperplane depend on the distribution of points within it , and thus how the appearance of two - dimensional scaling laws can vary depending on this distribution .",
    "section  [ sec : scaling_laws ] illustrates these effects using two classic scaling laws  the mass - metallicity relation and the mg@xmath5 relation .",
    "possible evidence for environmental variation in the former is presented .",
    "sections  [ sec : disc_sz ] and [ sec : disc_plane ] investigate the origins of the hyperplane .",
    "the @xmath6-plane in particular appears difficult to explain and , if it proves general , will place very tight constraints on the history of star formation in local elliptical galaxies .",
    "section  [ sec : conc ] summarizes our findings and conclusions .",
    "this section briefly describes the g93 and fornax samples , the lick / ids line - strength system , the models used to transform line strengths into ssp - equivalent parameters , and final population parameters for the central ( @xmath11 ) aperture observations of g93 and fornax ellipticals .",
    "a complete description of the data and their transformation into stellar population parameters was given in paper i. structural parameters drawn from the literature for these galaxies are also given .",
    "trager ( 1997 ) showed that deriving ssp parameters from balmer and metal lines requires line - strength data of very high quality , with errors preferably @xmath12 .",
    "only three published samples approach this level of accuracy : gonzlez ( 1993 ) , kuntschner ( 1998 ) , and fisher , franx , and illingworth ( 1995 ) .",
    "the original g93 sample consists of 41 early - type galaxies , of which 40 are included in the present study ( ngc 4278 is discarded because of its strong emission ) . all g93 galaxies used here have been classified as elliptical ( or compact elliptical ) in the rc3 ( @xcite ) or the rsa ( @xcite ) and carnegie atlas ( @xcite ) , except for ngc 507 and ngc 6703 , both classified as sa0 in the rc3 but not included in the rsa or carnegie atlas , and ngc 224 , the bulge of the sb galaxy messier 31 .",
    "the environmental distribution of the g93 sample is skewed toward relatively low - density environments .",
    "as discussed in paper i , most of the galaxies are in small groups of varying richness , many are relatively isolated , and six are members of the virgo cluster .",
    "only one is in a rich cluster ( ngc 547 in abell 194 ) .",
    "environmental effects on the stellar populations of ellipticals are discussed in sections  [ sec : other_views ] and [ sec : scaling_laws ] below .",
    "the g93 sample is augmented here with data from kuntschner ( 1999 , hereafter k98 ; cf .",
    "@xcite ) on early - type galaxies in the fornax cluster .",
    "these data have been carefully transformed to the lick line - strength system .",
    "eleven of the 22 galaxies in k98 are ellipticals .",
    "ssp parameters have been derived for them following the method below , after correcting the central line strengths ( table 3.4 of k98 ) to the @xmath11  aperture using the gradients presented in table 7.2 of k98 .",
    "the high - accuracy elliptical galaxy sub - sample of fisher et al . ( 1995 ) repeats galaxies in g93 and agrees well with it .",
    "these data have therefore not been used here .",
    "paper i describes our technique for inverting line strengths to determine ssp parameters .",
    "ages , metallicities , and enhancement ratios of old stellar populations are determined by comparing observed absorption - line strengths to the _ single - burst stellar population ( ssp ) _ models of w94 , which depend on metallicity and age .",
    "the line - strengths of the worthey models correspond to solar abundance ratios ; these have been corrected for non - solar abundance ratios as described in paper i using the theoretical spectral calculations of tb95 , who tabulated the response of the lick / ids indices to changes in the abundance ratios of important elements .",
    "ssp - equivalent @xmath0 , @xmath1}$ ] , and @xmath2}$ ]  are derived for each galaxy by searching a finely - spaced grid of points in @xmath13 space .",
    "central line strengths corrected to the @xmath11  aperture are presented in figure  [ fig : re8 m ] for the g93 and k98 samples .",

    "mathematically , the fe - plane is `` flatter '' in velocity dispersion than the @xmath6-plane .      [",
    "sec : errors ]    it is important to examine the role that observational errors play in creating the above correlations , particularly the @xmath6- and fe - planes . from figure",
    "[ fig : re8 m ] , it is evident that an error in any one of the observed quantities @xmath402 , @xmath403 , or @xmath10  will cause correlated errors in the output quantities @xmath1}$ ] , @xmath2}$ ] , and @xmath0 .",
    "however , @xmath10is the most critical index , and errors in it are the most dangerous .",
    "moving @xmath10  up in figure  [ fig : re8 m ] causes age to decline and @xmath1}$ ]  to increase ( @xmath2}$ ]  is less affected ) .",
    "this correlated error is responsible for the long axis of the tilted error ellipses in the two plane diagrams , figures  [ fig : tz ] and  [ fig : tf ] .",
    "note that these ellipses point almost directly parallel to the claimed trends in age at fixed @xmath5 .",
    "note further that the error ellipse in figure  [ fig : tzs_edge ] is parallel to the edge - on view of the @xmath6-plane , indicating that errors do not significantly broaden the plane ( the same is true of the fe - plane though no edge - on view is shown ) .",
    "hence , it is possible for errors , if they are big enough , to create the _ impression _ of planes by broadening a distribution that is intrinsically merely a one - dimensional line .",
    "for example , all ellipticals might be the same age , obey the @xmath2}$]@xmath5 relation ( a line ) , and be broadened by large @xmath10  errors to fill apparent `` planes '' just like those observed .",
    "the only defense against such an error is to know from independent measurements that the observational errors are small .",
    "that is why we use only the g93 and kuntschner ( 1998 ) samples , whose errors are small and well understood .",
    "the rms error of @xmath10  in g93 is 0.060  , and in kuntschner ( 1998 ) is 0.089  , with errors in the other indices being comparable . as shown by the error",
    "ellipses in the figures , these errors are small enough that the observed planes can not be artifacts .",
    "much larger errors , however , would be disastrous .",
    "for example , figure  [ fig : tz ] also shows the error ellipse for a typical galaxy in the ids sample of twfbg98 ( @xmath411 for the 150 highest - quality galaxies ) .",
    "monte carlo simulations of this sample ( @xcite ) have shown that the observed @xmath1}$]- and fe - planes were largely artifacts caused by observational errors ; this is consistent with the large size of the ids error ellipse in figure  [ fig : tz ] .",
    "a reasonable guide is that @xmath10  must be accurate to @xmath412   to measure reliable ages and metallicities .",
    "we compare next to other studies using balmer - line data to determine stellar population parameters .",
    "the study by kuntschner ( 1998 ) on fornax ellipticals is quite consistent with ours , which is not surprising since we use the same data and similar models .",
    "kuntschner s conclusions were limited by the fact that his corrections for non - solar abundance ratios were only approximate . nevertheless , his findings that the fornax ellipticals are mainly old and that they show a strong @xmath2}$]@xmath5 relation are confirmed here .",
    "the study by jrgensen ( 1999 ) of 71 early - type galaxies in coma is similar in both approach and conclusions to the present work .",
    "jrgensen ( 1999 ) analyzed newly obtained long - slit and multi - fiber spectra and derived stellar population parameters using line - strength models by vazdekis et al .",
    "overall her findings are similar to ours , including a @xmath4[mg / fe ] relation like that in figure  [ fig : sa ] , an age@xmath413}$ ]  relation rather like that in figure  [ fig : tz ] , and a tight age@xmath230}$ ]  relation nearly identical to that in figure  [ fig : tf ] .    however , the typical error of @xmath10  in the jrgensen data is @xmath414  , with a long tail to larger errors .",
    "overall , her data are comparable in accuracy to the ids data of twfbg98 , which were found to be inadequate for age determination by trager ( 1997 ) . given our present understanding of the pernicious effects of errors ( section  [ sec : errors ] ) , we suspect that some of the trends found by jrgensen are real but that others may be largely artifacts caused by errors .",
    "specifically , the @xmath4[mg / fe ] relation found by jrgensen is almost certainly correct , whereas any of the relations involving age ( including both the @xmath6-plane and the fe - plane ) are likely to be heavily contaminated .",
    "a high - accuracy line - strength survey of coma ellipticals is badly needed .",
    "the study of tantalo , chiosi & bressan ( 1998a ) analyzed g93 data and is thus relatively unaffected by observational errors .",
    "a detailed comparison to this work was made in paper i. the methodology of these authors is very similar to ours except that only @xmath402  is corrected for non - solar ratios whereas @xmath403  is unchanged .",
    "their method essentially measures @xmath1}$ ]  based on @xmath403  alone , and metallicities are consequently underestimated and enhancements overestimated , by amounts that increase with @xmath2}$ ] .",
    "systematic errors increasing with @xmath2}$ ]  introduce slope errors into most correlations .",
    "for example , tcb98 find a strong @xmath2}$]age relation , which seems to be our @xmath2}$]@xmath5 relation lensed through correlated errors .",
    "the importance of this discussion is to show that the factors used to correct line strengths for non - solar abundance ratios  in particular the _ relative amplitudes _ of the corrections to @xmath402  and @xmath403have far - reaching consequences for parameter correlation studies .",
    "our corrections are based self - consistently on the tb95 response functions , but independent checks of those functions would be welcome .",
    "the notion that the stellar - population manifold of elliptical galaxies is inherently two - dimensional is key to understanding many two - parameter relationships involving these galaxies .",
    "most such relationships are either projections of this higher - dimensional space or are close relatives of such projections .",
    "the slope and scatter of points in such projections are not fundamental , but rather depend on the distribution of points within the hyperplane .",
    "the question of sample selection thus enters acutely , as that may govern the distribution of points in the plane .",
    "figure  [ fig : tzas_proj ] shows several examples of how two - dimensional projections are affected by the distribution of points in the hyperplane .",
    "points are coded by the environment of each galaxy in preparation for the discussion of environmental effects in the next section .",
    "figure  [ fig : tzas_proj]a ( upper left panel ) shows the independent variables @xmath5 vs. @xmath0 . since the @xmath9 distribution governs the appearance of all other projections , it is interesting to compare the distributions within it of galaxy subsamples classed by environment ; isolated , group , and cluster ellipticals are shown by open circles , small dots , and large dots respectively .",
    "these distributions look rather different ; cluster e s ( large filled circles ) are grouped near the top of the plot , except for three young outliers shown by the labeled points : ngc  1373 is a bona fide member of fornax based on position and velocity yet is conspicuously young , the only young fornax elliptical ; ngc  4489 is 4 degrees from the center of virgo but is a member by radial velocity",
    ". it , too , is rather young , as is ngc  4478 , which is right near the center of virgo and is clearly a cluster member . within the errors , however , the bulk of cluster galaxies is consistent with being old and coeval .",
    "group and isolated objects ( which we collectively term `` field '' ellipticals ; small dots and open circles ) are distributed differently from cluster ellipticals in the hyperplane .",
    "they cover a larger age range , and there is a weak trend in @xmath0 vs.  @xmath5 in the sense that low-@xmath5 galaxies tend to be younger ; the clump of old , low-@xmath5 galaxies that is prominent among the cluster galaxies is also missing .    we conclude that the @xmath9 distributions of local field and cluster ellipticals differ in the present sample , and that their two - parameter projections may also differ on that account .",
    "that prediction is explored in the following panels .",
    "figure  [ fig : tzas_proj]b ( lower left panel ) plots @xmath1}$ ]  vs. @xmath5 . a velocity dispersion ",
    "metallicity relation appears to exist for old cluster galaxies , but the three young cluster galaxies ngc 1373 , ngc 4489 , and ngc 4478 lie at higher @xmath1}$ ]  at given @xmath5 .",
    "no comparable relation appears to exist for field ellipticals .",
    "this difference is a natural consequence of the differences in the @xmath9 distributions above .",
    "this projection is a close relative of the classic mass - metallicity relation and is discussed further in section  [ sec : enveff ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : tzas_proj]c ( upper right panel ) shows the distribution of @xmath2}$ ]  as a function of age .",
    "there is no apparent trend in @xmath2}$]with @xmath0 in any sample .",
    "this is as expected , since we found earlier that @xmath2}$ ]  depends only on @xmath5 and not on @xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ fig : tzas_proj]d ( lower right panel ) shows the distribution of @xmath2}$ ]  as a function of metallicity @xmath1}$ ] .",
    "there is a weak tendency for @xmath2}$ ]  to increase with @xmath1}$ ] , especially among old cluster ellipticals , suggesting higher sne ii / sne ia enhancement ratios in higher - metallicity galaxies .",
    "this trend among old cluster e s is again expected from their narrow age distribution in figure  [ fig : tz]in a narrow age range , @xmath1}$ ]  increases with increasing @xmath5 , and therefore @xmath2}$ ]  should increase with @xmath1}$ ]  at fixed @xmath0 .",
    "our results so far can be summarized as follows .",
    "a principal component analysis demonstrates that central stellar populations in the present sample of local elliptical galaxies can be largely specified using just two independent variables ; we take these to be ssp - equivalent age , @xmath0 , and velocity dispersion , @xmath5 .",
    "velocity dispersion is the only structural parameter that appears to play a role in modulating the stellar populations of these galaxies .",
    "this two - dimensional `` metallicity hyperplane '' is in turn comprised of two sub - relations : metallicity is a linear function of both @xmath0 and @xmath5 , which we call the `` @xmath6-plane , '' and enhancement ratio , @xmath2}$ ] , is a linear function of @xmath5 , increasing towards high-@xmath5 galaxies .",
    "together these two subrelations comprise the hyperplane .",
    "several caveats are necessary .",
    "first , the thickness of the hyperplane appears to be at least partly real and is associated mainly with scatter in the @xmath2}$]@xmath5 relation .",
    "thus , the populations are not perfectly two - dimensional , and at least one more factor must play a role .",
    "second , the present ssp parameters are based on only three spectral indices ( @xmath402 , @xmath403 , and @xmath10 ) , and adding more indices ( or colors ) might reveal more principal components ; we will be investigating this in future papers .",
    "third , coverage of the hyperplane needs to be improved by adding more young populations , which are relatively scarce here .",
    "fourth , the present data refer to only 51 galaxies ; a larger sample is needed to confirm that the present trends in fact apply to local elliptical galaxies generally .",
    "fifth , we must remember that the hyperplane refers to _ ssp - equivalent _ population parameters , which are disproportionately influenced by young stars ( see appendix ) .",
    "however , despite the fact that ssp - parameters are not true mass - weighted averages , they still place very tight constraints on the history of star formation in ellipticals , as shown below in sections  [ sec : disc_sz ] and [ sec : disc_plane ] .",
    "finally , the present analysis delineates the position and orientation of the hyperplane in hyperspace but says little about the distribution of galaxies within it .",
    "that is because our sample does not constitute an unbiased _ volume - limited _ sample of local ellipticals .",
    "this places severe limits on our conclusions .",
    "for example , we can not conclude that the wide range of of ssp ages seen in our field galaxies is typical of local field ellipticals generally .",
    "however , there is a strong suggestion in our data that the @xmath9 distributions of field and cluster galaxies may differ , with cluster ellipticals in the present sample being generally older .",
    "this difference is expected to generate environmental differences in the two - dimensional projected scaling laws of these galaxies , as explored in the next section .",
    "this section investigates two classical scaling laws for elliptical galaxies : the mass - metallicity relation and the mg@xmath5 relation .",
    "both can be understood as two - dimensional projections of the metallicity hyperplane .",
    "environmental differences among elliptical galaxies have generated intense interest ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we consider here their impact on a question of major importance , the mass - metallicity relation of elliptical galaxies , widely regarded as a key clue to their nucleosynthetic histories ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the relation comes in several guises : @xmath1}$ ]  vs.  mass , @xmath1}$ ]  vs.  luminosity , and @xmath1}$ ]  vs.  @xmath5this last also counts as a mass - metallicity relation since mass and @xmath5 are so closely correlated .",
    "these three projections are compared in figure  [ fig : massz ] .",
    "the @xmath1}$]@xmath5 projection ( panel a ) is repeated here from figure  [ fig : tzas_proj ] .",
    "we have already observed that any relation in this panel is weak ; old cluster galaxies ( large filled circles ) show a trend in the classic sense that high-@xmath5 galaxies are more metal rich , but this trend is not shared by field galaxies ( open circles and small dots ) .",
    "panels b and c show @xmath1}$ ]  vs. mass and @xmath1}$ ]  vs. absolute magnitude ( the latter quantities are taken from table  [ tbl : ddq ] ) .",
    "these relations show even more scatter than @xmath1}$]vs .",
    "@xmath5 , and the real mass - metallicity relation ( panel b ) is worst of all .",
    "it is not our purpose to argue here that there is _ no _ mass - metallicity relation .",
    "rather , like many two - dimensional correlations claimed for elliptical galaxies , the mass - metallicity relation is actually a projection of a higher - dimensional space .",
    "as such , it may be both environmentally and sample dependent , and its accurate determination will require a larger and more carefully controlled sample than we have here .",
    "the mg@xmath5 relations present a major challenge to the hyperplane model .",
    "the tightness of these relations has often been taken as evidence that all ellipticals have nearly coeval stellar populations to of order 15% in age ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , in strong contradiction to the spread of about a factor of 10 in ssp ages found in this work .",
    "we are planning a separate paper on this important issue but include a short section here in order to address pressing questions that will occur to knowledgeable readers .",
    "our picture is that the mg@xmath5 relations look narrow because they are edge - on ( or nearly edge - on ) projections of the metallicity hyperplane . the germ of this idea is contained in figure  [ fig : tz ] , which shows the @xmath6-plane face on .",
    "imagine rotating this plane about an axis running perpendicular to the contours of constant @xmath5 and viewing the resultant projection edge - on .",
    "suppose further that ssp - equivalent age and metallicity `` conspire '' to cause @xmath402  ( or @xmath416 ) to remain sensibly constant along a @xmath5contour .",
    "this would occur if @xmath417}}}=-1.7 $ ] or @xmath418 ( w94 ) , and indeed the @xmath6-plane at fixed @xmath5 ( equation  [ eq : tzs ] ) has slope very close to this : @xmath417}}}=-1.4 $ ] .",
    "in other words , lines of constant @xmath5 closely obey the 3/2 rule , and line - strength along them should be nearly constant . in projection ,",
    "@xmath402  and @xmath416  should therefore be tight functions of @xmath5 , yielding the mg@xmath5 relations .    to illustrate this graphically , we have performed monte carlo simulations to produce @xmath402  and @xmath5 values for roughly 500 `` fake '' elliptical galaxies realistically distributed in the metallicity hyperplane .",
    "random values of the first two principal components in table  [ tbl : pca ] were drawn from the distribution of galaxies in the face - on view of the plane ( figure  [ fig : pca ] ) , and the third and fourth components were set identically to zero .",
    "these four pca eigenvectors were then inverted to determine @xmath0 , @xmath1}$ ] , @xmath2}$ ] , and @xmath5 for each realization , and the first three parameters were used to generate line strengths using the formalism described in paper i , with typical observational errors added .",
    "the resulting simulated @xmath402@xmath5 relation is shown in figure  [ fig : mgbsigma]a . the derived relation ( dotted line )",
    "has the form @xmath419 with an rms scatter of only 0.007 .",
    "the @xmath402@xmath5 relation for the present sample of local elliptical galaxies ( dashed line , panel b ) has the form @xmath420 with an rms scatter of 0.032 ( 51 galaxies ) .",
    "the good agreement between the simulated relation and the real one confirms that a large age spread of stellar populations in the hyperplane can indeed be masked by the tendency of @xmath1}$ ]  to rise at low ages , precisely compensating the effect of age differences .",
    "we briefly mention a few important points , saving details for our future paper :    \\(1 ) the idea that the tightness of the mg@xmath5 relations might conceal large age variations was first proposed by worthey et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and was re - proposed by jrgensen ( 1999 ) . in both cases ,",
    "the actual age spreads were probably somewhat overestimated , as worthey et al .",
    "used the lick / ids data while jrgensen used her coma sample , both of which contain significant observational errors ( sections  [ sec : errors ] and [ sec : sum_compare ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the basic correctness of the idea is confirmed here .",
    "\\(2 ) while the slopes of the real and simulated @xmath402@xmath5 relations match well , the scatter in the simulated relation is too small even though observational errors have been included .",
    "that is because the third and fourth principal components were neglected , i.e. , the hyperplane was taken to be infinitely thin .",
    "this was done deliberately to make any residual tilt of the hyperplane more visible .",
    "even with this , the simulated relation is still extremely narrow , showing that any deviation from an edge - on orientation must be small .",
    "the larger scatter of the real @xmath402@xmath5 relation must be due to the presence of pc3 and pc4 , which were not included in the simulation .",
    "pc3 , in particular , reflects real scatter in the @xmath2}$]@xmath5 relation , as noted in section  [ sec : results_sa ] .",
    "\\(3 ) although the mg@xmath5 relations are generally tight , morphologically disturbed ellipticals tend to show lower mg values than expected , and this has been convincingly interpreted as due to recent star formation by schweizer et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and schweizer & seitzer ( 1992 ) .",
    "comparably young stellar populations are present in some of our galaxies here ( e.g. , ngc 6702 , ngc 5831 , ngc 1700 ) , yet none of these shows any significant deviation from @xmath402@xmath5 in figure  [ fig : mgbsigma ] . is this a disagreement ?    a full discussion of this point is reserved to our future paper , but we can sketch the answer briefly here .",
    "first , the mg relations used by schweizer et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and schweizer & seitzer ( 1992 ) actually plotted mg vs. luminosity , @xmath421 , not @xmath5 .",
    "recent star formation would increase @xmath421 while depressing mg , thus amplifying any mg residual .",

    "this process might be more important for sne ii , which are highly spatially and temporally correlated , than for sne ia , which seem to be relatively isolated in both time and position within a galaxy .",
    "this may enable low-@xmath5 galaxies to lose their sn ii products preferentially without losing gas that can later be enriched by sne ia and recycled into new stars .",
    "although scenarios 5 and 6 predict similar abundance _ trends _ with @xmath5 , they appear to differ in their absolute abundance ratios . with `` normal '' yields ,",

    "such a tweak might be achived , for example , by boosting the upper end of the imf in all ellipticals by a similar amount .",
    "this requirement would constitute an additional burden on scenario 6 .    in summary , there appear to be two viable scenarios that can currently account for all three observational trends with @xmath5 : ( 1 ) a flatter top end of the imf that produces more massive stars at high @xmath5 , and ( 2 ) weaker early winds , less mass loss , and greater retention of sn ii products at higher @xmath5 . although we can not tell which hypothesis is better",
    ", it is interesting , and a significant step forward , that the data seem to prefer scenarios in which it is the number or effectiveness of type ii sne that are modulated , not the number of type ia s .",
    "a further new clue is that @xmath2}$ ]  correlates most tightly with @xmath5 and not with other related structural parameters , such as mass or radius .",
    "this tells us that the processes modulating type ii sne depend directly on the actual speeds of gas clouds , or possibly on the escape velocity from the galaxy . finally , it is necessary to restate the disclaimer that to reach these firmer conclusions required using all three observational tests , including the two less universal correlations involving @xmath1}$ ]  and @xmath230}$ ] .",

    "two basic star - formation scenarios for ellipticals are considered : ( 1 ) a pure single - burst population having the measured ssp age and composition , and ( 2 ) a double - burst population consisting of an old `` base '' population with a `` frosting '' of young stars .",
    "more complex scenarios can be inferred by extrapolating the results of the two - burst model .      under the single - burst hypothesis , we observe that the @xmath6-plane is in place at the present time ( figure  [ fig : tz ] ) and ask how it evolved in the past and how it will evolve in the future .",

    "our sample shows a possible difference in the ( @xmath458 ) distribution with environment  our field ellipticals span a wide range in ssp age , while the fornax and virgo ellipticals are generally old .",
    "this results in a significant mass - metallicity trend for the cluster galaxies but not for the field galaxies .",
    "other correlations between stellar population parameters and structural parameters may also turn out to vary with environment .",
    "the mg@xmath5 relations are edge - on projections of the metallicity hyperplane . at a given @xmath5 , young age",
    "is offset by a correspondingly high metallicity , preserving line strength .",
    "the narrowness of the observed mg@xmath5 relations therefore does not imply a narrow range of ages at fixed velocity dispersion .",
    "a more detailed look at the mg@xmath5 relations is the subject of a future paper .",
    "physical models to account for the hyperplane have been considered .",
    "the rise in @xmath2}$ ]  with @xmath5 and the mass - metallicity relation ( at fixed @xmath0 ) is consistent with a higher effective yield of type ii sne products at high @xmath5 .",
    "this trend has several possible explanations , for example , greater retention of outflow - driven gas or a flatter imf at high @xmath5 .",
    "the existence of the @xmath6-plane is more challenging .",
    "a `` frosting '' scenario is favored , in which young stars are added to an old base population , resulting in a range of ssp - equivalent ages . with a suitable choice of burst populations ,",
    "the composite populations can be engineered to lie on lines of constant @xmath5 in the @xmath6-plane after a few gyr . however , to preserve both the @xmath6-plane and the @xmath2}$]@xmath5 relation requires that abundances in the frosting population must be closely coupled to that of the base population  the metallicity , @xmath1}$ ] , of the frosting must be somewhat higher than that of the base population , while the enhancement ratio , @xmath2}$ ] , must be nearly equal .",
    "the frosting scenario therefore seems to favor star formation from gas that was pre - enriched in the same parent galaxy rather than from gas that was accreted in an unrelated merger .",
    "however , several merger remnants in the sample do indeed lie nicely on the @xmath6-plane , in defiance of this logic .",
    "the present picture of the hyperplane is preliminary and needs to be checked against a better local sample and a wide array of other data .",
    "for example , ssp mass - to - light ratios should be compared to dynamical @xmath459 measurements , and _",
    "global _ ssp parameters should be analyzed , as they are more indicative of the global star formation history than the central ssp parameters used here .",
    "a further interesting question is whether the color - magnitude relation and other scaling laws might also be near - edge - on projections of the hyperplane , like mg@xmath5 .",
    "most important , the implications of the frosting model must be developed for lookback observations of distant elliptical galaxies .",
    "many observations of distant cluster ellipticals suggest that their stellar populations formed very early , and this may be consistent with the generally old ages for cluster galaxies found here .",
    "our field ellipticals do show a wide spread of ssp ages , but we have noted that the sample is not volume - limited , and thus predictions for the evolution of distant field ellipticals can not yet be drawn . in short ,",
    "a great deal more data must be gathered and reconciled before we can claim a solid understanding of the star formation histories of elliptical galaxies .",

    "in this section we discuss simple models of composite stellar populations based on double bursts .",
    "our approach is similar to the `` isochrone synthesis '' method of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) , in which composite populations are built up from single stellar populations ( ssps ) treated as @xmath460-functions .    at present , it is not our intent to create grids of models with multiple populations drawn from galaxy formation and evolution models including the effects of winds , blowout , and other processes ( see @xcite and @xcite for two examples of this approach ) .",
    "rather , we are interested in determining rough rules of thumb for adding multiple populations in the @xmath10-metallicity diagrams . specifically we ask how mixtures of two bursts or multiple metallicities combine to mimic a single ssp of a given age and metallicity .",
    "we begin by describing the method used to combine the w94 ssps to derive line strengths .",
    "we then discuss two models of composite populations : galaxies with multiple ( here , two ) bursts of star formation , and a model with a single age but a dispersion in metallicity based on the metallicity spread of m32 as determined by grillmair et al .",
    "we show that line strengths add as vectors in the diagrams to first order ( when weighted by light ) .",
    "there is thus an infinite number of ways of decomposing a given population into single - burst components .",
    "determining the detailed star formation histories of old stellar populations from the present data is highly underconstrained .      the line strength for a single stellar population ( when expressed as an equivalent width in  )",
    "can be written @xmath461 where @xmath462 is the width of the feature bandpass in  , @xmath463 is the observed flux ( per unit mass ) integrated over the feature bandpass , and @xmath464 represents the observed flux ( per unit mass ) of the straight line connecting the midpoints of the blue and red pseudocontinuum levels , integrated over the feature bandpass ( @xcite ; @xcite ; paper i ) . in a composite population ,",
    "the fluxes become sums over populations and therefore @xmath465 where @xmath466 represents each individual population , @xmath467 is the fraction by mass of each population ( @xmath468 ) , and @xmath469 and @xmath470 are the integrated fluxes in the feature bandpass and in the `` continuum '' of each population @xmath466 .",

    "this is shown by the relatively straight lines linking the endpoint populations in figure  [ fig : twoburstl ] and the relatively uniform tickmark spacing along the lines .",
    "taking model c as an example , we can compare the light - weighted vector rule for predicting the 50/50 population , versus its actual location in the diagrams . for model c , the real composite 50/50 population ( 50% old , 50% young by light )",
    "is at ( 1.9 gyr , @xmath489 , @xmath490 ) while the vector - added point midway between the two endpoints is at ( 2.5 gyr , 0.0 , @xmath492 ) . for an 80/20 model ( 80% old ,",
    "20% young by light ) , the real population is at ( 7.3 gyr , @xmath493 , + 0.15 ) compared to the vector - added population at ( 9.5 gyr , @xmath494 , + 0.15 ) .",
    "thus , vector weighting by light tends to overestimate the age by about 25% , underestimate @xmath1}$ ]  by 0.10.25 , and underestimate @xmath2}$ ]  by less than about 0.1 .",
    "these are extreme cases , and the errors for mixing two populations closer in the diagrams would be smaller .    in the past , we have stated that the best - fitting ssp - equivalent age ( as derived here ) is close to the `` light - weighted '' age ( @xcite ) .",
    "this was a mis - statement .",
    "the light - weighted age of the 50/50 model is simply the average of 1 gyr and 17 gyr , or 9 gyr , much larger than the ssp - equivalent age , of 1.8 gyr .",
    "what we meant to say is that composite populations add in the diagrams _ like light - weighted vectors_. as noted , the age agreement is much better , within 50% , when computed this way .",
    "however , valuable as such rules of thumb may be for cultivating intuition , the only proper way to compare models to data is to add up the fractional index contributions using equation  [ eq : cspew ] .",
    "the light - weighted vector rule can not be taken too far and does better for @xmath403  than for @xmath402 , whose trajectories are not as straight in the grid diagrams .",
    "this may prove to be a boon in accounting for the very high @xmath402  strengths of galaxies like ngc 507 , ngc 6702 , and ngc 720 , whose @xmath402  indices lie high up and to the right in figure  [ fig : re8 m ] .",
    "such populations might be modeled as recent starbursts , as suggested independently by their high morphological disturbance parameters ( @xcite ) .      yet a fourth model ( not shown ) explores the effect of a spread in metallicities at a single age .",
    "this model is based on the metallicity distribution in an outer field of m32 determined by grillmair et al.(1996 ; their figure  10 ) , which has a strong peak at @xmath495}}}={\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{[z / h]}}}=-0.20 $ ] , fwhm of about 0.5 , a weak tail to low metallicities down to @xmath3961.2 , and a light - weighted mean metallicity of @xmath475 ( note that @xmath228}}}\\approx0.00 $ ] for m32 ) . for an assumed single age of 8.5 gyr , the composite model yields @xmath496  ,",
    "@xmath497  , and @xmath498  , in good agreement with the outwardly extrapolated data from g93 of @xmath499  , @xmath500  , and @xmath501 (grillmair et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the ssp - equivalent stellar population parameters of the composite model are @xmath502 gyr , @xmath401}}}=-0.32 $ ] , and @xmath228}}}=0.00 $ ] .",
    "these results show that the integrated light from a uniform - age population with a strongly peaked metallicity distribution resembles a population of nearly the same age ( or slightly younger if metal - poor stars are present ) and of very similar @xmath1}$ ]  to the true light - weighted metallicity ( @xmath401}}}=-0.25 $ ] ) .",
    "these results agree with composite multi - metallicity populations by greggio ( 1997 ) , who found that shifts of ssp - equivalent metallicities in mixed - metallicity populations were not large in the absence of large metal - poor tails .    to summarize , the results in this appendix suggest that metallicity spreads ( and , by extension , spreads in @xmath2}$ ] ) at fixed age do not seriously skew the indices , but that even small populations of recently - formed ( within @xmath503 gyr ) stars can significantly reduce the inferred age .",
    "a burst of only 10% by mass 1 gyr ago on top of a 17 gyr old population gives an ssp - equivalent age of only @xmath504 gyr . because line strengths add as vectors ( weighted by the luminosity of each population ) , the ages and metallicities of each burst in a composite population are not separable using the present data .",

    "<S> this paper analyzes single - stellar - population ( ssp ) equivalent parameters for 50 local elliptical galaxies as a function of their structural parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxy sample is drawn from the high - quality spectroscopic surveys of gonzlez ( 1993 ) and kuntschner ( 1999 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the basic data are central values of ssp - equivalent ages , @xmath0 , metallicities , @xmath1}$ ] , and `` enhancement '' ratios , @xmath2}$ ] , derived in paper i , together with global structural parameters including velocity dispersions , radii , surface brightnesses , masses , and luminosities .    </S>",
    "<S> the galaxies fill a two - dimensional plane in the four - dimensional space of @xmath1}$ ] , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath2}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> ssp age , @xmath0 and velocity dispersion , @xmath5 , can be taken as the two independent parameters that specify a galaxy s location in this `` hyperplane . '' </S>",
    "<S> the hyperplane can be decomposed into two sub - relations : ( 1 ) a `` @xmath6-plane , '' in which @xmath1}$ ]  is a linear function of @xmath4 and @xmath3 ; and ( 2 ) a relation between @xmath2}$ ]  and @xmath5 in which @xmath2}$]is larger in high-@xmath5 galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> velocity dispersion is the only structural parameter that is found to modulate the stellar populations ; adding other structural variables such as @xmath7 or @xmath8 does not predict @xmath1}$ ]  or @xmath2}$ ]  more accurately .    </S>",
    "<S> cluster and field ellipticals follow the same hyperplane , but their @xmath9 distributions within it differ . </S>",
    "<S> most fornax and virgo cluster galaxies are old , with a only a small sprinkling of galaxies to younger ages . </S>",
    "<S> the field ellipticals span a larger range in ssp age , with a tendency for lower-@xmath5 galaxies to be younger . </S>",
    "<S> the present sample thus suggests that the distribution of local ellipticals in the @xmath9 plane may depend on environment . </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath9 distribution affects all two - dimensional projections involving ssp parameters , many of the familiar scaling laws attributed to ellipticals may also depend on environment . </S>",
    "<S> some evidence for this is seen in the current sample . </S>",
    "<S> for example , only fornax ellipticals show the classic mass - metallicity relation , whereas other sub - samples do not .    </S>",
    "<S> the tight mg@xmath5 relations of these ellipticals can be understood as two - dimensional projections of the metallicity hyperplane showing it edge on . at fixed @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> , young age tends to be offset by high @xmath1}$ ] , preserving mg nearly constant . </S>",
    "<S> the tightness of the mg@xmath5 relations does not necessarily imply a narrow range of ages at fixed @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> although ssp parameters are heavily weighted by young stars , modeling them still places tight constraints on the total star formation history of elliptical galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the relation between @xmath2}$ ]  and @xmath5 is consistent with a higher effective yield of type ii sne elements at higher @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this might occur if the imf is enhanced in massive stars at high @xmath5 , or if more sne ii - enriched gas is retained by deeper galactic potential wells . either way , modulating type ii yields vs. @xmath5 seems to fit the data better than modulating type ia yields .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath6-plane is harder to explain and may be a powerful clue to star formation in elliptical galaxies if it proves to be general . </S>",
    "<S> present data favor a `` frosting '' model in which low apparent ssp ages are produced by adding a small frosting of younger stars to an older `` base '' population ( assuming no change in @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the frosting abundances are close to or slightly greater than the base population , simple two - component models run along lines of constant @xmath5 in the @xmath6-plane , as required . </S>",
    "<S> this favors star formation from well - mixed pre - enriched gas rather than unmixed low - metallicity gas from an accreted object . </S>"
