    "with the advent of modern database technology numerous large scale network data - sets have been made available .",
    "this development has triggered a surge of activity in studies of statistical network properties  @xcite .",
    "the underlying idea of these studies is that the network structure ( the way the networks differ from completely random networks ) contain some information of the function , both locally and globally , of the network .",
    "hence a common theme in these works has been the development of structural measures to characterize network structure . in this paper",
    "we propose and evaluate a measure of a previously unstudied network structure  a special case of symmetry we call _ degree symmetry_. in geometry an object is symmetrical if it is invariant to rotations , reflections , and so on . in networks , with no given geometrical embedding , these concepts have to be relaxed .",
    "furthermore , we would like to have a continuous measure saying not only if a vertex is a local center of symmetry or not , but also how symmetric the vertex is .",
    "the aspect of symmetry we address is , roughly speaking , that if you look at the object ( network in our case ) in different ways from a symmetric vertex it still looks the same .",
    "we process of `` looking '' will in our case be walking along paths ( non - self intersecting sequences of edges ) .",
    "furthermore , since degree ( number of neighbors ) is commonly regarded as the most fundamental quantity relating a vertex to its function , we say two vertices `` look the same '' if they have the same degree . we will thus derive our measure by performing walks along all paths from a vertex and compare the sequence of degrees of the vertices along these paths .",
    "the situation we have in mind is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ill]all paths from the central vertex have degree sequences starting with @xmath0 , thus the central vertex is highly degree symmetric .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : first we give a detailed derivation of the degree - symmetry coefficient ( in two different versions , appropriate for different needs ) .",
    "then we evaluate these on example networks and a biochemical network .",
    "finally we discuss the average degree symmetry of different classes of real - world networks .",
    "we will consider the network represented by a graph @xmath1 of @xmath2 vertices , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 edges , @xmath5 .",
    "for a vertex @xmath6 to have high degree symmetry it has , as mentioned , to have many paths with the same sequence of degrees .",
    "we will use a cut - off @xmath7 for the pathlength and consider only paths of that length .",
    "the reason for this cutoff is threefold : first , in all ( with possibly some curious exception ) network processes , a vertex is more affected by its closest surroundings then vertices further away . thus one would like to have a lower weight on the contribution from distant vertices .",
    "second , the number of vertices @xmath8 steps away grows fast with the distance from @xmath6 . for finite networks",
    "this means that the paths soon reach the periphery of the network where unwanted finite - size effects set in .",
    "third , for computation speed , one benefit from a cutoff .",
    "assume there are @xmath9 paths of length @xmath7 from a vertex @xmath6 .",
    "we then denote the degree sequences of these paths @xmath10,\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\vdots\\\\   & & , [ k(v^1_{p , i , l}),\\cdots , k(v^l_{p , i , l})]\\big\\},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 denotes the degree of a vertex @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the @xmath14th vertex of along the @xmath15th path of length @xmath7 leading out from @xmath6 .",
    "then if there are unexpectedly many vertices at the same ( @xmath14- ) index in the sequence with the same degree , the vertex @xmath6 is a local center of degree symmetry",
    ". a rough symmetry measure would thus be to count the fraction of index - pairs with the same degree , i.e.@xmath16 where @xmath17 this measure is very crude and lack many desired statistical features .",
    "for example , all paths that go via a particular neighbor of @xmath6 will give a contribution to the sum .",
    "in practice this means that vertices with a high degree vertex rather far from itself ( but closer that @xmath7 ) will trivially have a high @xmath18 .",
    "a first step would thus be to omit the contribution of vertices occurring in many sequences of @xmath19 at a specific index .",
    "i.e. , for all @xmath20 one wants to exclude the terms @xmath21 where @xmath8 and @xmath22 are indices of paths that are identical the first @xmath23 steps , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : para ] ) .",
    "let @xmath24 denote the number of such terms .    to calculate @xmath24 consider a path @xmath25 of length @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath27 be the number of paths from @xmath6 of length @xmath7 that start with the path @xmath28 .",
    "we call @xmath27 the _ branching number _ of @xmath28 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : def](a ) .",
    "all pairs of paths starting with @xmath28 will contribute to @xmath29 a distance @xmath23 from @xmath6 ( since they all pass through @xmath14 ) .",
    "let @xmath30 be the set of neighbors to @xmath14 that is not on the path @xmath28 from @xmath6 to @xmath14 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : def](b ) .",
    "( the number of elements in @xmath30 is thus @xmath31 . )",
    "this situation gives a contribution @xmath32 from vertices of indices in the interval @xmath33 $ ] of @xmath19 to @xmath29 , where @xmath34 denotes the path @xmath35 .    to further improve the measure one would like to , assuming some null - model , subtract the expected random contribution to @xmath18 .",
    "if this can be achieved one would have a symmetry coefficient @xmath36 that is zero when the symmetry is what can be expected from the null - model , larger if @xmath6 is a center of unexpectedly high symmetry , and less than zero if @xmath6 is degree anti - symmetric . a final symmetry coefficient",
    "could thus be written @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the expected value of @xmath39 in a null - model .",
    "@xmath40 can only happen if there is one or no path of length @xmath7 .",
    "in both these cases the degree - symmetry concept makes no sense so , if @xmath41 , we set @xmath42 . the null - model we assume is random constrained on the degree distribution of the network .",
    "i.e. , given the fraction @xmath43 of @xmath44-degree vertices the network is as random as possible . as it turns out @xmath38",
    "is tricky to calculate analytically .",
    "there are two ways to proceed  either one calculates an approximative @xmath38 or one obtains @xmath38 via averaging @xmath45 over realizations of the null - model . except being more accurate , the latter approach has the advantage of giving an error estimate of @xmath36one can by specifying a p - value define significantly symmetric , or anti - symmetric , vertices .",
    "we will use both approaches : the approximative method for analyzing example networks and the numerical method for analyzing real - world data .",
    "we obtain an approximative value of @xmath38 , @xmath46 , by assuming @xmath38 is approximately equal to the probability that a pair of vertices , reached by walking along paths , is the same .",
    "note that , since there are @xmath44 ways into a degree-@xmath44 vertex , when following a path the probability to reach a degree-@xmath44 vertex is @xmath47 thus the probability @xmath46 that two vertices of the same degree is reached by following different paths is @xmath48 one reason this approach is not exact is that the number of terms in the expression for @xmath29 increases with the degree of the @xmath14 in @xmath30 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cont ] ) .",
    "there are other higher - order effects to related to other correlations between the path structure and the degree of the vertices .",
    "to summarize we have two measures of local vertex symmetry , one approximative : @xmath49 and one based one monte carlo sampling @xmath50 the sampling is conveniently done by random rewiring the edges of the original network  @xcite .",
    "the heart of algorithm , as suggested in the previous section , is a depth - first search with depth @xmath7 .",
    "when the returning along the traced out paths the branching number can be calculated recursively through @xmath51 @xmath52 can be calculated simultaneously using eq .",
    "( [ eq : cont ] ) .",
    "a slight complication is that the same vertex may appear in different branches of the depth first search while calculating @xmath53 and @xmath54 . for small cut - off values",
    "this is easy to handle : for @xmath55 it does not affect the calculation at all . for @xmath56 one would only have to keep different depths ( of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cont ] ) and ( [ eq : bn ] ) ) separate . for the calculation of @xmath29",
    "the terms of @xmath19 has to be stored .",
    "since the number of paths @xmath9 grows fast with @xmath7 , this can be quite a constraint for a large @xmath7 .",
    "luckily it suffices to store a histogram @xmath57 counting the number of vertices of degree @xmath44 at position @xmath23 of the paths @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath9 ( and thus @xmath58 ) can be calculated as the number of time the depth @xmath7 of the depth first search is reached .",
    "the running time of the algorithm is @xmath59 .",
    "a mean field approximation for networks with few triangles gives @xmath60 .",
    "the method outlined above can quite straightforwardly be extended to network with directed edges , distinct types of edges or ( integer ) edge weights .",
    "imagine a network with @xmath61 different edge sets @xmath62 .",
    "such networks frequently occur in cellular biochemistry ",
    "protein interaction networks where different types of protein interaction can be recorded  @xcite , or gene regulation networks where the edges can be activating or inhibitory .",
    "one sensible way to extend the above procedure is to use the union of the edges as your graph but to say two pairs of vertices in @xmath19 are identical if their degrees with respect to all of the networks are the same . to formalize this @xmath19",
    "would be generalized to @xmath63,\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\vdots\\\\   & & , [ \\mathbf{k}(v^1_{p , i , l}),\\cdots ,   \\mathbf{k}(v^l_{p , i , l})]\\big\\},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is a vector with @xmath12 s degrees with respect to the different edge - types . and the @xmath65-function of eq .",
    "( [ eq : para2 ] ) would be one if the arguments are equal at all their indices , and zero otherwise .",
    "the @xmath46 has to be redefined too : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the conditional probability that a vertex has degree @xmath44 with respect to edge set @xmath68 given that its degree in the union network is @xmath69 .",
    "the case of a directed network can be treated similarly  one consider paths following edges in both directions but a vertex pair gives a contribution to @xmath54 only if both the in- and out - degrees are the same .    the approach of sect .",
    "[ sect : algo ] can straightforwardly be applied to networks where multiple edges are allowed . since",
    "multiple edges can be used to model weighted graphs  @xcite the generalization to weighted graphs ( at least where edge - weights represent the probability of following an edge ) is simple .",
    "the other aspect of multigraphs , self - edges , is trivially dealt with  by the requirement that a paths should not intersect themselves a self - edge will never be followed and can thus be omitted already when the graph is constructed .",
    "the overlap required for a vertex pair to be considered equal in the calculation of the symmetry coefficient is rather strict .",
    "sometimes one would like to treat two paths as similar even if their degrees differs slightly .",
    "particularly , this applies to broad degree distributions .",
    "the functional difference between degree-2 and degree-3 vertices may be significant ; but whether a vertex has degree 1002 or 1003 probably does not matter . to achieve such a relaxation",
    "one can construct a integer sequence @xmath70 and let @xmath71 i.e. , one construct a series of equivalence classes of vertices . for a power - law , or similarly broad ,",
    "degree distributions one can let @xmath72 increase exponentially with @xmath6",
    ". in this case one also has to modify the definition of @xmath46 @xmath73",
    "in this section we evaluate the measure for example networks and real - world networks .",
    "we will use the smallest non - trivial cut - off @xmath55 throughout this section .",
    "most conclusions hold for @xmath56 or @xmath74 .      to get a feeling for the @xmath75 measure we start by considering a few small test networks , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ex ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ex](a ) we display a network with the same degree symmetry , with respect to the central vertex ( triangle ) , as fig .",
    "[ fig : ill ] .",
    "as expected the central vertex has a strong degree symmetry coefficient . to carry through the calculation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : app ] ) once we obtain the degree distribution @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 giving @xmath79 .",
    "all length-2 paths out from the central vertex have the degree sequence @xmath80 so @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 giving @xmath84 .",
    "the degree-3 vertices ( squares ) have two degree sequences of their outgoing paths @xmath85 and @xmath86 , whereas paths from degree-2 vertices ( triangles ) have degree sequences @xmath87 and @xmath88 . this difference is larger than expected from the null model ( random networks with eight degree-2 vertices , four degree-3 vertices and one degree-4 vertex ) , thus the negative @xmath89 values for these vertices .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ex](b ) we show a graph where all vertices have positive degree - symmetry coefficient . paths from degree-2 vertices have only the degree sequence @xmath80 and paths from degree-3 vertices have only the degree sequence @xmath88 .",
    "thus , for every vertex , the view of degrees along the path out to the rest of the network is the same no matter which direction one looks in from that vertex .",
    "a radically different view is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ex](c ) . in this case",
    "the vertices have three distinct positions in the network .",
    "the vertices marked with squares have degree two and four outgoing paths of degree sequences @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath92 . the circles , despite their different network position ( as being part of triangles ) , have the same set of degree sequences for their paths of length two .",
    "the degree-3 vertices have six length-2 paths : three having the degree sequence @xmath86 , three having degree sequence @xmath92 .",
    "it is easy to convince oneself that this close to as dissimilar a network with four degree-2 and two degree-4 vertices can be .",
    "consequently all vertices have negative degree - symmetry indices .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the fig .",
    "[ fig : ex](c ) possesses other symmetries than degree - symmetry .",
    "the layout has , for example , reflexive symmetry along a vertical axis .",
    "we emphasize that such symmetries would need to be captured by other measures .",
    "if all vertices have the same degree a network is called _ regular _  @xcite . then by definition all paths are known to fully overlap .",
    "this trivial overlap should be canceled in our symmetry measure so @xmath42 for all @xmath7 and @xmath6 . since @xmath24 is the number of terms in @xmath29 and all these terms",
    "are one we have @xmath93 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath94 which gives @xmath36 for all vertices and cut - off lengths .",
    "next we evaluate the average approximative symmetry coefficient @xmath95 for random graphs  @xcite  graphs obtained by successively adding @xmath4 edges between @xmath2 vertices with the restriction that no multiple edge , or self - edge , may occur .",
    "such networks have no correlations at all and can serve as a reference point for neutrality  @xcite .",
    "ideally we would like such networks to , on average , have a degree - symmetry coefficient of zero . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : er ] @xmath96 converge to a small but positive value .",
    "the decay is roughly inversely proportional to @xmath2the same scaling as the fraction of triangles in the network  which suggests that the presence of triangles , and perhaps other short - cycles , is an important source of finite size effects of @xmath97 .",
    "we conclude that the monte carlo sampling measure @xmath98 ( or a more elaborate measure ) is needed if one wants to compare different networks .",
    "if , on the other hand , one aims to compare different vertices of the same network the faster @xmath99 calculation is sufficient .",
    "this is not an uncommon situation in the design of network measures .",
    "another example of this where neutrality is non - zero in the large-@xmath2 limit is _ modularity _ , measuring how good a subgraphs that are densely connected within but not between each other  @xcite .",
    "in this section we apply our measures to real - world networks .",
    "first we take a look at the symmetry coefficients of specific vertices in the metabolic network of humans , then we look at the average symmetry coefficients of various classes of networks .      an important use of statistical graph theory is to characterize chemical reaction networks . of many possible network representations  @xcite we",
    "let vertices be chemical substances , and for all reactions of an organism we link substrates with products .",
    "for example , the hypothetical reaction @xmath100 would contribute with the edges @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , @xmath104 to the metabolic network .",
    "the data is derived from the kegg database ( http://www.genome.jp/ ) , and described in detail in ref .  @xcite . since the degree distributions of metabolic networks are highly skewed  @xcite we use a exponentially increasing set of intervals as equivalence classes ( as discussed in the connect of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ks ] ) ) : @xmath105 .",
    "it has been argued that degree is strongly related to the function of the chemical substance  @xcite .",
    "this means that the degree symmetry potentially can give additional information about the function of the vertices . for the human metabolic network , and @xmath55 , roughly half of the vertices",
    "have a p - value of less than 5% ( i.e. , in the null - model sampling of the calculation of @xmath106 , less than 5% or more than 95% of the values of @xmath107 are smaller than the value of the real network ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hsa](a ) we show the 2-neighborhood of one vertex with significantly higher @xmath106 than expected ; fig .",
    "[ fig : hsa](b ) depict the 2-neighborhood of a vertex with significantly higher @xmath106 .",
    "the reason these particular vertices are used as examples is that their 2-neighborhoods are of appropriate sizes , neither too big , nor too small , to be displayed and described .",
    "spermine , fig .",
    "[ fig : hsa](a ) , is a substance with high degree - symmetry@xmath108 .",
    "both its neighbors are in the same degree - equivalence class of vertices with degree four to seven .",
    "of vertices two steps away from spermine there is also a significant overlap with two ( out of four ) neighbors to the neighbor spermidine being in the equivalence class defined by degrees in the interval @xmath109 ; whereas two vertices are in the equivalence class of degrees in @xmath110 .",
    "the three paths from spermine via s - adenosylmethioninamine also contribute to the overlap in the two steps from spermine as two vertices ( methylthioadenosine and spermindine ) have degrees in the same equivalence class .",
    "the neighborhood of c04850 , seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : hsa](b ) , is visually less balanced and also having a negative degree - symmetry@xmath111 .",
    "we note that there are some vertex pairs in the second neighborhood whose degree - classes overlap , but apparently this is not enough to make the symmetry coefficient non - negative .      [ cols=\"<,>,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     so far we have discussed degree symmetries of vertices . in this section",
    "we average @xmath75 over @xmath3 to obtain a graph - wide measure for degree symmetry . in table",
    "[ tab : avg ] we display values of @xmath106 for a number of different network types .",
    "some of these have highly skewed degree distributions .",
    "for these , the exponentially increasing degree equivalence classes of sect .",
    "[ sect : meta ] are appropriate . since we intend to compare all networks we use the same equivalence classes for all networks .",
    "the first observation is that almost all networks have a positive average symmetry coefficient .",
    "the only clear exception is the airport network .",
    "this means that if you start a two - leg airplane trip at a particular airport , choosing between two random itineraries ( without caring about the frequency of flights ) , then the probability of the airports along these itineraries being different in number of connections is smaller than in a random network .",
    "the strongest degree - symmetries are found in one - mode projections of social affiliation networks .",
    "note that the other social networks , derived from questionnaires and electronic communication does not have such strong symmetry coefficients . in one - mode projections high - degree vertices",
    "are known to have strong tendency to attach to other high - degree vertices , and low - degree vertices to attach to other low - degree - vertices  so called assortative mixing  @xcite .",
    "if this property is strong there will be regions of vertices with high degree and other regions with low - degree vertices .",
    "the paths within these regions would also have similar degree sequences .",
    "thus high assortative mixing can be related to high degree symmetry , the first causing the second or vice versa .",
    "they are , of course , not equivalent  e.g . , the example network with all vertices having positive symmetry coefficients ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ex](b ) ) is maximally disassortatively mixed ( in the sense of ref .",
    "where the weak symmetry coefficients of other networks come from is outside the scope of this investigation .",
    "one possible explanation would be that functional units  @xcite might often be degree - symmetric centers .",
    "we have derived a measure for a specific notion of symmetry in networks  the property that the paths out from a vertex have overlapping degree sequences .",
    "the measure is designed so that random networks , conditioned only to have the same set of degrees as the original network , have the value zero .",
    "we propose two versions of the symmetry coefficient , the first being approximately zero for random networks , the second requiring a randomization procedure ( and thus longer simulation time ) but being more accurately zero for random networks .",
    "the measure was evaluated on example graphs .",
    "we show that they are able to detect vertices in degree - symmetric , and potentially functionally meaningful positions in the human metabolic network .",
    "the average degree - symmetry of various networks were also investigated .",
    "we found almost all networks having a weakly positive degree coefficient .",
    "the exceptions being the network of american airports and their interconnections ( having a negative degree - symmetry coefficient ) and one - mode projections of social affiliation networks ( having rather strongly positive values ) .",
    "our measure is not the first to be based on a the properties of paths going out from a vertex .",
    "for example people have been using path counts for assessing the functional similarity of pairs of vertices  @xcite . in social network studies",
    "such measures are commonly called `` ego - centric ''  @xcite .",
    "symmetry concepts have been successfully utilized in many field of physics .",
    "we believe degree symmetry , and other classes of network symmetries , will be a fruitful direction of future network studies .",
    "degree symmetry is in particular , we believe , an important concept for networks where degree is strongly related to the function of the vertex .",
    "two open questions from this study is what causes the rather ubiquitous weakly positive degree symmetries , and what process in the airline decision making that causes the negative average symmetry coefficient of the airline network .",
