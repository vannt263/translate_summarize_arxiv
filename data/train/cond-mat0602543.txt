    "nematic liquid crystals are non - polar liquids consisting of elongated molecules aligned , on the average , parallel to a common direction @xmath0  @xcite . the unit vector @xmath1 is called the _",
    "director_. exceptionally , in the case of `` negative order , '' the molecules may be distributed perpendicularly to @xmath1 .",
    "the nematic order is quantified by a symmetric traceless tensor  @xmath2 , of cartesian components @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "microscopically , calling @xmath5 a unit vector parallel to the long axis of the molecules , the tensor order - parameter can be defined as @xmath6 , where the brackets denote statistical averaging and @xmath7 is the kronecker symbol . for uniaxial",
    "ordering , which corresponds to the preferred state of the nematic in the bulk , two of the eigenvalues of @xmath2 are equal ; in this case @xmath3 can be written as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the scalar order - parameter .",
    "note that @xmath10 corresponds to the isotropic phase ( randomly oriented molecules ) , occurring at temperatures above the nematic ",
    "isotropic phase transition ; @xmath11 corresponds to the ordinary nematic , in which the molecules are aligned on the average parallel to  @xmath1 , while @xmath12 corresponds to the `` negative '' case , in which the molecules are on the average orthogonal to  @xmath1 .",
    "the alignment of a nematic liquid crystal by a bounding interface is of considerable interest both for fundamental and technological reasons . in the most common situations ,",
    "this `` anchoring '' effect is well described by a surface free energy depending only on the director @xmath1 at the interface@xcite .",
    "three typical situations are : _ i _ ) _ homeotropic _ anchoring , where the preferred , or `` easy '' , average orientation corresponds to @xmath1 normal to the interface , _ ii _ ) _ planar _ anchoring , where the preferred average orientation corresponds to @xmath1 lying in one particular direction parallel to the interface , and _ iii _ ) _ planar degenerate _ anchoring , where all the planar orientations for @xmath1 are equivalent easy directions .",
    "the latter situation is often realized with isotropic bounding fluids , e.g. , glycerin  @xcite or gallium  @xcite ; degenerate anchorings can also be obtained with polymer - grafted surfaces@xcite .    in general , surface interactions also perturb the _ degree _ of nematic ordering , e.g. , the value of  @xmath13 . above the bulk",
    "isotropic transition temperature , this effect may induce the _ wetting _ of the surface by a nematic layer with @xmath14 , as predicted by sheng  @xcite .",
    "this effect , long ago observed by miyano  @xcite , was also recently detected by a surface force apparatus measuring the related capillary condensation  @xcite .",
    "although nematics are uniaxial in the bulk , the wetting layer may exhibit _ biaxiality _ due to the lower symmetry near the surface  @xcite . in the biaxial case ,",
    "the symmetric and traceless @xmath3 has its three eigenvalues @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) all different . a nematic director , @xmath1 ,",
    "can still be defined as the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue of largest modulus , say @xmath17 . by analogy with the uniaxial case , one",
    "can then define the scalar order - parameter by @xmath18 ; the amount of biaxiality , @xmath19 , is then defined by @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    the aim of the present paper is to model the _ planar degenerate anchoring _ of nematic liquid crystals , using the tensorial landau - de gennes formalism . to our knowledge , this has not been done before . actually , there is some confusion in the literature , since a number of papers dealing with `` degenerate planar anchoring '' describe in fact homeotropic anchoring with negative @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the confusion arises from the fact that the molecules themselves are planar and randomly oriented in this homeotropic situation .",
    "again , conventional planar degenerate anchoring describes the tendency of a substrate to favor the _ common alignment of the molecules along any direction parallel to its surface _  @xcite .",
    "this is the very situation that we consider in this paper .",
    "let us recall some of the existing tensorial anchoring models .",
    "the simplest quadratic surface free energy favoring a given _ non - degenerate _ nematic ordering @xmath22 , i.e. , a well - defined director and a well - defined scalar and , possibly , biaxial order - parameter , was proposed by nobili and durand  @xcite : @xmath23 here , and throughout , summation over repeated indices is implicit . because @xmath24 is proportional to the sum of the squares of the components of @xmath25",
    ", it obviously has , for @xmath26 , a unique minimum for @xmath27 . in this simple situation , the surface energy _ itself _ possesses a well - defined minimum . in principle , this is not necessary : the only requirement is that the nematic free energy as a whole , i.e. , the sum of the surface and the bulk free energies , be bounded from below . for instance , early descriptions have dealt with only a _ linear _ surface free energy @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the normal to the interface  @xcite .",
    "actually , it is not clear at which order the surface free energy expansion should be truncated . in principle",
    ", for any truncation , one should verify that the higher - order terms are indeed negligible ( this is especially critical in the case of large surface couplings ) .",
    "another difficulty , when dealing with truncated surface free energies not bounded from below , is that one can not determine which kind of anchoring they favor without including bulk terms and solving the whole problem . for these reasons",
    ", we shall concentrate in this paper on surface free energies that possess well - defined minima by themselves .",
    "the most general _ quadratic _ form describing isotropic substrates is  @xcite @xmath30 it contains all the scalars up to quadratic order made with @xmath2 and @xmath29 ( the surface normal ) . minimizing @xmath31 with respect to the five components of the most general symmetric traceless tensor yields , in the basis where the @xmath32-axis is along @xmath29 , a unique extremum  @xcite , uniaxial , at @xmath33 , where @xmath34 .",
    "this corresponds to a _",
    "homeotropic _ anchoring ( @xmath35 ) with either @xmath11 or @xmath12 depending on the sign of @xmath36 .    ) , with @xmath37 and @xmath38 , for a _ uniaxial _ surface order - parameter @xmath39 , where @xmath40 .",
    "the angle @xmath41 is the inclination of the director with respect to the substrate and the radial coordinate corresponds to the scalar order - parameter @xmath42 .",
    "the energy does not depend on @xmath43 .",
    "darker shadings corresponds to lower energies .",
    "the absolute minimum is attained for degenerate planar anchoring : @xmath44 ( or @xmath45 ) and @xmath46 ; the apparent homeotropic minimum for @xmath47 and @xmath12 is actually a saddle - point with respect to the biaxial degree of freedom ( outside the plane of this figure ) . ]    to obtain a planar degenerate uniaxial minimum , it is necessary to include terms of order higher than two .",
    "we shall go up to fourth order to have a surface free energy bounded from below . note that this is also the lowest order for the bulk free energy to correctly describe the nematic ",
    "isotropic phase transition .",
    "our aim is to obtain a degenerate manifold of minima for @xmath48 , where @xmath1 is an arbitrary unit vector parallel to the substrate , and where @xmath49 is fixed . to this purpose , we define @xmath50 and we look for the constraints ensuring that @xmath51 takes the form @xmath52 , where @xmath1 is parallel to the substrate .",
    "the two following conditions are necessary and sufficient  @xcite : _ i _ )",
    "@xmath51 must coincide with its projection on the substrate @xmath53 , where @xmath54 , and _ ii _ ) the trace of the square of @xmath51 must be equal to @xmath55 , that is @xmath56 .",
    "the simplest surface free energy being minimum if , and only if , these two conditions are satisfied is @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "this surface potential is of fourth - order in @xmath2 and covariant .",
    "it is not , however , the most general fourth - order expansion giving rise to a planar degenerate anchoring : one can add , for instance , a contribution proportional to the square of the first term and several other similar , but linearly independent , terms . in the basis where the @xmath32-axis is along the surface normal @xmath29 , the above surface potential takes the explicit form @xmath60\\nonumber\\\\ & + & 4\\,w_2\\left(q_{xx}^2 + q_{yy}^2 + q_{xx}\\ , q_{yy}+ q_{xy}^2 + q_{xz}^2 + q_{yz}^2 - \\frac{{s_0}^2}{3 } \\right)^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have taken into account that @xmath2 is symmetric and traceless ( @xmath61 ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : polar ] , the surface potential @xmath62 possesses a degenerate absolute minimum for uniaxial order - parameters with planar director and @xmath63 .",
    "no other minima are present : the apparent homeotropic minimum with negative scalar order - parameter visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : polar ] is actually a saddle point with respect to biaxial perturbations .",
    "to test the physical properties of the surface potential  ( [ eq : f4 ] ) , we consider a semi - infinite sample filled , for @xmath64 , with a liquid crystal either in the nematic or in the isotropic phase .",
    "for the bulk free energy density we take the fourth - order landau - de gennes expansion  @xcite : @xmath65 where the comma indicates spatial derivation .",
    "the coefficients @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 are assumed positive , @xmath69 is an elastic constant ( in the one constant approximation ) , @xmath70 is the temperature , and @xmath71 is the supercooling temperature of the isotropic phase .",
    "we define the normalized temperature @xmath72 and the rescaled order - parameter @xmath73 .",
    "the first - order nematic ",

    "the dimensionless bulk and surface free energy densities become @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively , with the normalized anchoring parameters @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "we look for equilibrium order - parameter profiles depending only on @xmath32 and possessing a symmetry plane orthogonal to the substrate , which we take as the @xmath84 plane .",
    "therefore , we set @xmath85 the minimization problem defined by @xmath86 and @xmath62 yields the euler - lagrange equations in the bulk : @xmath87,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the boundary conditions on the substrate , i.e. , at @xmath88 , @xmath89-\\frac{2}{9}w_1\\left(3\\beta+s_0\\right),\\\\ \\frac{d\\beta}{dz}&= & \\frac{8}{3}w_2\\,\\beta\\left[3\\left(\\alpha^2+\\beta^2+\\gamma^2+\\alpha\\,\\beta\\right)-s_0 ^ 2\\right]+\\frac{4}{9}w_1\\left(3\\beta+s_0\\right),\\\\ \\frac{d\\gamma}{dz}&=&\\gamma\\left [ \\frac{8}{3}w_2\\left[3\\left(\\alpha^2+\\beta^2+\\gamma^2+\\alpha\\,\\beta\\right)-s_0 ^ 2\\right]+\\frac{6}{3}w_1\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and for @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",

    "[ fig : phase]b .",
    "note that the transformation from @xmath116 to  @xmath110 is a continuous evolution between two states having the same symmetry and not a phase transition : the discontinuity in  @xmath103 and the cusp in  @xmath104 , which occur when the biaxiality is maximum , do not correspond to any actual discontinuity of  @xmath126 .",

    "in the  @xmath116 state , @xmath132 : the eigenvalue of @xmath133 of maximum modulus is  @xmath134 .",
    "this corresponds to a nematic director along  @xmath32 ( homeotropic ordering ) , with the _ negative _ scalar order - parameter  @xmath135 and the amount of biaxiality  @xmath136 . in the  @xmath110 state ,",
    "@xmath137 : the eigenvalue of maximum modulus is now  @xmath138 .",
    "this corresponds to a nematic director along  @xmath97 ( planar ordering ) , with the _ positive _ scalar order parameter  @xmath139 and the amount of biaxiality  @xmath140 . at the transformation , @xmath141 :",
    "no nematic director can be defined and the amount of biaxiality is maximum ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "therefore , the discontinuous change of sign of  @xmath103 and the cusp of  @xmath104 at the transformation are not due to a discontinuity of  @xmath133 but to the change of the direction associated to the eigenvalue of maximum modulus .",
    "note also that the width of the  @xmath116 region is extremely narrow and goes to zero at the tricritical point .",
    "our findings are compatible with the experimental data of tarczon and miyano  @xcite , who observed a pretransitional uniaxial negative birefringence with optical axis perpendicular to the surface , corresponding to our @xmath111 state , for the compound mbba in contact with a silane - treated substrate giving planar degenerate anchoring in the nematic phase .",
    "this _ negative _ pretransitional birefringence was not observed for the compound 5cb on the same substrate , which probably corresponds to our @xmath110 surface state .",
    "as we have shown , the surface free energy describing a _ planar degenerate _ anchoring in the framework of the landau - de gennes formalism must be at least of fourth - order in the tensorial order - parameter @xmath2 . here , we have proposed the simplest expression having this property and we have investigated the associated anchoring and wetting behavior . in the nematic phase , we find the expected planar degenerate anchoring with , however , a small surface biaxiality . in the isotropic phase , a surface wetting layer appears : for large enough surface couplings it is planar biaxial , while for low couplings it is homeotropic uniaxial with negative scalar order - parameter .",
    "these predictions are compatible with the experimental observations for substrates yielding planar degenerate anchoring  @xcite .",
    "the transition between the two surface states may be of first or second order .",
    "the biaxiality in the planar states tends to zero for large surface coupling , yielding a uniaxial degenerate planar anchoring or wetting .",
    "it would be interesting to study the consequences of this degenerate anchoring in more complicated geometries such as , e.g. , colloidal suspensions .",
    "after this work was completed , prof .",
    "sluckin kindly pointed out to us that the surface potentialof ref . [ 8 ] , linear in the tensor order - parameter , gives a genuine planar degenerate anchoring in the case of complete wetting .",
    "we checked numerically that this is true , although the ordering is strongly biaxial in a coherence length close to the surface .",
    "accordingly , above the transition temperature , where the wetting layer is of thickness comparable to the coherence length , the surface layer is strongly biaxial .",
    "our fourth - order potential , on the other hand , gives an almost perfectly planar ordering in the whole microscopic layer , since it directly favors the planar anchoring .",
    "degenerate minima are possible if @xmath143 , or if @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "the first case corresponds to any @xmath2 possessing one eigenvector along @xmath29 ( hence with arbitrary biaxiality ) .",
    "the second case corresponds to @xmath2 uniaxial homeotropic with arbitrary @xmath13 .    according to the first condition , the non - zero components of @xmath51 , in the basis where",
    "the @xmath32-axis is along @xmath29 , can be written as @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148",
