    "the cayley tree is a loopless graph where the coordination number @xmath3 on each site is the same except at the boundary .",
    "it is known that boundary effects tend to be dominant on the cayley tree , since the number of the boundary sites on the tree increases exponentially with respect to the diameter @xmath2 of the tree . in some cases",
    ", the boundary effect remains even in the thermodynamic limit @xmath4 , as is known in the case of ferromagnetic ising model@xcite ; a thermodynamic quantity of the whole system is dominated by those area near the boundary . on the other hand , an expectation value of a local quantity at the center of the tree can be different from the averaged value for the entire system .",
    "such a  bulk \" property , which appears deeply inside the system , can be described by the bethe lattice , which can be regarded as an infinite cayley tree without boundary .    in this article",
    ", we consider a way of obtaining the  bulk \" property of observables on the cayley tree .",
    "for this purpose we try to suppress the boundary effect .",
    "it is well known that the strength of the boundary effects is dependent on boundary conditions .",
    "the most simple one is the open boundary condition ( obc ) , where the boundary effect is relatively conspicuous .",
    "a typical example is the friedel oscillation caused by the open boundary .",
    "it is possible to suppress such a sudden boundary effect by imposing the periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) .",
    "however , pbc on the cayley tree is non - trivial .",
    "a solution is to introduce so called the smooth boundary condition ( sbc)@xcite , where the local energy scale varies smoothly from the maximum at the center to zero at the boundary .    in one dimension , a class of sbc called  sine - square deformation \" ( ssd)@xcite efficiently reduces the boundary effect . for a variety of one - dimensional systems",
    ", it has been confirmed that the boundary effect in the ground state vanishes entirely under ssd@xcite .",
    "the ssd has been applied to quantum entanglement analysis on spin chains@xcite and the ground state study of a simple string theory@xcite .",
    "the validity of ssd for two - dimensional system is also confirmed@xcite .",
    "recently , a method of obtaining bulk quantities by means of ssd , the method which is called as the grand canonical analysis , is proposed@xcite and applied to kagome heisenberg antiferromagnet@xcite .",
    "an advantage of this grand canonical method is that one can easily access bulk quantities from numerical observables of finite - size systems .    in this paper , we compare bulk properties of the nearest - neighbor hopping model on the bethe lattice , with observables on the cayley tree , performing a numerical calculation with the aid of the grand canonical analysis . this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : tb ] , we introduce the nearest - neighbor hopping model on the cayley tree .",
    "we shall see that the friedel oscillation disturbs the bulk quantity under obc . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sbc ] , we impose sbc to the model . the obtained results are compared with the bulk quantities on the bethe lattice . we conclude the obtained result in sec .  [ sec : last ] .",
    "we first consider how to label sites on the cayley tree .",
    "we introduce a site - centered tree with coordination number @xmath3 , where there are @xmath2 shells .",
    "figure  [ tree ] shows the case @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "all the interior sites have @xmath3 neighboring sites , but those boundary sites have only one .",
    "regarding the center of the lattice as the 0-th shell , each site on the @xmath1-th shell can be labelled by a set of @xmath7 integers @xmath8 where @xmath9 , and where @xmath10 takes values as follows @xmath11    .",
    "the number of shell @xmath2 is equal to 3 .",
    "all sites are labeled according to the index rule in eq .",
    ".,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    next we introduce a spinless nearest - neighbor hopping model on the cayley tree .",
    "we introduce fermionic creation and annihilation operator , respectively , @xmath12 and @xmath13 on each site labeled by @xmath14 in eq .  .",
    "the hopping between neighboring sites @xmath14 and @xmath15 is expressed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 corresponds to the hopping amplitude , and the on - site potential is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the chemical potential . by means of these notations ,",
    "the nearest - neighbor hopping hamiltonian on the tree is given by @xmath20 for example , in the case of @xmath21 , the hamiltonian is written as @xmath22 since the hopping is terminated at the boundary , the open boundary condition ( obc ) is imposed naturally .",
    "now we shall see the behavior of local observables in the ground state under obc .",
    "since the hamiltonian contains no interactions between particles , we can obtain the one - particle eigenstate from the following eigenvalue relation @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the @xmath25-th eigenvalue , and where @xmath26 is the corresponding one - particle wave function .",
    "we assume the increasing order for @xmath24 . by means of @xmath26",
    ", the site occupation is expressed as @xmath27 under the grand canonical ensembles .",
    "similarly , the bond energy between neighboring sites @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be obtained as @xmath28 . \\label{bond_energy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the nearest - neighbor hopping model on the tree has many degenerate energy levels due to the symmetry of the tree . if and only if the chemical potential @xmath19 coincides with one of such energy levels , there exist a ground states degeneracy .",
    "throught this article , we avoid such a coincidence , and we choose @xmath19 so that the ground state is determined uniquely . in this situation , the particle density @xmath29 in eq .   and the bond energy @xmath30 in eq .",
    "are constant within each shell .",
    "hence , they are the functions of @xmath1 , the shell index .",
    "we thus use simpler forms @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes @xmath33 .    since the total number of sites in the system increases exponentially with respect to @xmath2 , it is not straight forward to solve the eigenvalue relation eq .",
    "numerically when @xmath2 is relatively large .",
    "this problem can be overcome by the block - diagonalization process@xcite .",
    "all the blocks in the hamiltonian matrix are symmetric tridiagonal matricies , whose size is @xmath34 at most , so that one can easily diagonalize each .",
    "note that this block - diagonalization procedure can be applied also for those cases where hamiltonian terms are position dependent , if @xmath17 and @xmath19 are the same for all the bonds and sites in the same shell .",
    "we shall compare the calculated density @xmath35 under obc with that on the bethe lattice@xcite , which is given by @xmath36 , \\label{exact - n}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the relation @xmath37 is satisfied .",

    "the modulation function @xmath46 is chosen to be smooth with respect to @xmath1 and vary from the maximum value near the center to zero at the edge .",
