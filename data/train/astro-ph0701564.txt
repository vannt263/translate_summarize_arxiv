    "when observed at optical or lower energies , radio - quiet agn appear to be rather stable and not highly variable .",
    "however , this picture changes dramatically when agn are observed in x - rays .",
    "flux variability by factors 2 - 3 on timescales of days to months is quite common among low- and high - luminosity agn .",
    "an increasing number that vary by factors 10 - 30 has emerged in the last decade , including in intermediate - type seyferts and narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) , and there is good evidence that a substantial part of that variability is caused by ( cold ) absorption , in terms of complete or partial covering .",
    "interestingly , the highest amplitudes of variability have been detected from the cores of non - active galaxies in terms of transient flares , interpreted as tidal disruptions of stars by the black holes at the centers of these galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "nls1s are objects with extreme properties : they show the steepest x - ray spectra , strongest optical feii emission and weakest [ oiii ] emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "nls1s are also known to be objects with very strong x - ray variability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "while x - ray transience is typically associated with an x - ray outburst caused by a dramatic increase in the accretion rate or the very onset of accretion , the situation is very different in wpvs 007 . during the rosat all - sky survey ( rass , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , when the source was x - ray bright , the optical - to - x - ray flux ratio was in a normal range for agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "however , all follow - up x - ray observations between 1994 and 2002 using rosat and _ chandra _   found it to have almost vanished from the x - ray sky @xcite .    until recently the cause for the transient behavior of wpvs 007 had been a mystery .",
    "@xcite suggested that this transience could be due to a temperature change in the accretion disk that would shift the soft x - ray spectrum out of the rosat pspc energy observing window .",
    "however , in recent years it became clear that the cause of the transience is absorption . in 1996 july , wpvs 007 was observed by hst @xcite ; a 2003 _ fuse _ observation revealed the emergence of a bal flow @xcite .",
    "a discovery of a re - brightening and following rise in the x - ray luminosity , and in spectral changes , will set tight constraints on the movement and location of the absorber , and on the nature of the absorption .",
    "the high amplitude of the variability makes wpvs 007 exceptional among the known cases of absorption variability . in order to detect a possible re - brightening and therefore the disappearance of the absorber",

    "as listed in table[uvot_log ] and shown in figure[wpvs007_uvot_lc ] wpvs 007 became fainter in the optical filters by about 0.1 mag and by about 0.2 mag in the uv filters in the 2006 july and december observations compared with the observations obtained in 2005 and 2006 january and 2006 september and october .",
    "the agn became brighter again by about 0.2 mag in the 2007 january observation which was about three weeks after the last observation in 2006 december .",
    "from the current light curve as shown in figure[wpvs007_uvot_lc ] the agn seems to be variable in the optical / uv on timescales of a few weeks to several months .    in order to determine whether this variability is real or just within the uncertainties we picked 4 field stars of similar magnitude as wpvs 007 as reference stars and",
    "compared their magnitudes segment by segment .",
    "table[ref_stars ] lists these 4 stars with the coordinates and their magnitudes in u , uv w1 , uv m2 , and uv w2 with statistical errors .",

    "note that during some of the observations not all the 4 stars were in the field of view of the uvot .",
    "u magnitudes could only be given for stars # 3 and 4 , because # 1 and 2 are too bright in the u filter that they suffer significantly from coincident losses .",
    "also note that star # 1 and # 2 were not in the field of view during some of the observations . as shown in table[ref_stars ] , the variance in the field stars is small compared with the variability observed in wpvs 007 .",
    "therefore , we consider the uv variability found in wpvs 007 to be real .",
    "the change by 0.2 mag in the uv filters observed during the 2006 july and december observations is larger than the uncertainties between the measurements in the field stars .",
    "wpvs 007 has shown variability on timescales of months before between the iue and hst observations between 1993 and 1996 .",

    "we excluded the 1995 november observation due to strong cosmic ray events during that observation .",
    "the data shown in figure[wpvs_uv_spec ] are the observed data , uncorrected for reddening .",
    "the iue spectra and the _ swift_-uvot data seem to agree . however , the hst spectra show a significantly lower flux than the iue and _ swift _  data .",
    "@xcite presented an internet database of uv continuum light curves of seyfert galaxies which also showed that wpvs 007 displays significant variability in the uv between the iue and hst observations .",
    "one possibility of a lower flux in the hst data is a mis - alignment of the source in the @xmath29 aperture in the hst fos .",
    "however , as listed in table[iue_hst_log ] , the agn was observed during several orbits and the fluxes in all these spectra agree with each other .",
    "a @xmath29 aperture is also rather large compared to the @xmath30 resolution .",
    "therefore we exclude a mis - allignment as the cause of the lower flux in wpvs 007 during the hst observation in 1996 july .",
    "note that @xcite reports v=15.28@xmath250.03 , b=15.77@xmath250.03 , and u=15.15@xmath250.03 . while the small differences in v and b can be explained by the different central wavelength between the filters used by @xcite and the uvot , the difference in u suggests that wpvs 007 is variable in u.      figure[wpvs007_sed ] displays the spectral energy distribution of wpvs 007 using 2mass nir data derived from the nasa extragalactic database , optical / uv data from _ swift _ s uvot from 2006 july and the x - ray data from the _ chandra _  observation from 2002 @xcite .",

    "assuming an @xmath31=1.5 we would expect a flux at 2 kev @xmath33 w m@xmath2 , or a luminosity at 2 kev @xmath34 w. however , as shown in figure[wpvs007_sed ] , this is not the case . during the rass observation , assuming an uv spectrum like during the _ swift _",
    "observations , the @xmath31was in the order of @xmath31=5.0 . the flattening of the uv spectrum , as shown by the uvot photometry data , suggests some intrinsic reddening of the agn . a nls1 typically has a very blue optical / uv spectrum , as shown e.g in @xcite for the nls1 rx j0148.3 - 2758",
    "assuming that the intrinsic optical uv spectrum of wpvs  007  is similar to that of rx j0148.3 - 2758 , we can estimate a reddening by 0.6 mag in the uv w2 filter .",
    "this results in a lower limit of the intrinsic reddening @xmath35=0.073 .",
    "note that this is a rough estimate . based on the h@xmath10/h@xmath36 flux ratio , @xcite estimated the extinction to @xmath371.0 which is significantly higher than our estimate .",
    "our main results are that wpvs  007  is still in a low state in x - rays and that it shows significant variability in the uv on timescales of months . adding all _ swift",
    "_  observations together ( except for the segment 005 data of 2006",
    "september 06 ) we determine a 3@xmath0 upper limit = 1.04@xmath38 counts s@xmath16 , which converts to an unabsorbed flux in the 0.3 - 10 kev band of @xmath1 w m@xmath2 .",
    "this upper limit is at a similar level to the rosat pointed pspc and hri observations .",
    "note that chandra , with its superb point spread function , was able to detect wpvs 007 at an even lower level @xcite within an exposure time of 10 ks .",
    "even though we could not detect a re - brightening of wpvs 007 in x - rays , it is still an exciting agn .",
    "note that the purpose of the _ swift_observations is not to obtain a deep detection , but to monitor the agn in order to detect when it re - brightens again .",
    "our uvot observations suggest that the agn is variable in the uv bands by about 0.2 mag within timescales of a few months .",
    "uv variability , however , is not uncommon in agn and has been reported for various agn such as ngc 4151 @xcite , ngc 5548 @xcite , akn 564 @xcite , and 3c 390.3 @xcite , but only a few nls1s have repeated uv coverage as good as wpvs 007 . in the case of wpvs",
    "007 we can speculate that the uv variability is likely to be caused by a change in the absorption column density and therefore the reddening in the uv . using the change in the uv w1 magnitude by 0.2 mag we can derive an additional @xmath39=0.032 .",
    "this would cause an additional reddening by 0.10 mag in v , 0.17 in u , and 0.28 in uv w2 which is consistent with the changes we observe during the 2006 july and december observations .",
    "however , a change in luminosity of the central engine can not completely been excluded based on the current data set .",
    "the variability we observed in the uv between the iue , hst and _ swift_-uvot observations was previously also noticed by @xcite between the iue and hst observations .",
    "this is not a calibration issue .",
    "there are no problems reported on the hst fos and iue observations either .",
    "also , looking at the light curves presented in the uv continuum light curve database by @xcite suggest that the uv flux is already decaying between the iue observation of 1994 to 1995 and that the 1996 hst observation is consistent with this decay .",
    "wpvs 007 may be one of the most extreme cases of x - ray weak nls1s such as those found by @xcite .",
    "the reddened optical / uv spectrum also suggests that the x - ray weakness of wpvs 007 is caused by absorption .",
    "however , of the 10 photons detected at the position of wpvs 007 in the _ chandra _  acis - s data @xcite , 8 have energies below 1 kev .",
    "a simple cold absorber would have absorbed all these photons .",
    "the solution could be a partial covering absorber that would allow some of the soft x - ray photons to escape .",
    "such partial covering absorbers have been found in several nls1s , such as mkn 1239 @xcite or 1h 0707 - 495 @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the low - state x - ray emission detected with chandra may actually represent the x - ray emission from the host galaxy ; the agn being completely absorbed . in order to check this",
    ", we used the blue magnitude of the galaxy to predict the expected x - ray flux from the host galaxy , using the correlation between @xmath40 and @xmath41 for early - type galaxies of @xcite .",
    "we use the extinction- corrected blue magnitudes measured with _ swift _ , @xmath42=15.48 , and a previous usno measurement , @xmath43=14.24 . on the one hand , and since the short _ swift _  observation may have missed part of the host galaxy contribution on the other hand .",
    "therefore , the estimate should only be regarded as order of magnitude ] .",
    "we then predict a host galaxy contribution to the x - ray luminosity of @xmath44 w , which may well account for all of the observed low - state emission . indeed",
    ", host galaxies typically show such soft , thermal spectra .",
    "however , as shown in figure 1 in @xcite the 10 photons found at the position of wpvs 007 seem to be consistent with a point source . in order to verify this statement , a much longer observation by _",
    "chandra _  is needed .",
    "we will continue monitoring wpvs 007 every 4 - 6 weeks with _ swift _  as long as the agn is not sun - constrained . especially more observations in the uv will give us a better handle on the timescales of the variability in the uv .",
    "first we want to thank neil gehrels for approving our too requests and the _ swift _  team for performing the too observations of wpvs 007 and scheduling the agn on a regular basis .",
    "we would also like to thank jay dunn for quickly checking the iue and hst data for any problems , matthias dietrich for various discussions about uv variability in agn , and the anonymous referee for useful comments and suggestions to improve the paper .",

    "<S> _ swift _  also finds this nls1 to be x - ray faint and not detected in the _ swift _  x - ray telescope at an 3@xmath0 upper limit of @xmath1 w m@xmath2 in the 0.3 - 10.0 kev band and confirms that the agn is still in a low state . during the 2006 july and december observations with _ </S>",

    "<S> this variability can be caused either by a change in the absorption column density and therefore the reddening in the uv , or by flux variations of the central engine . </S>",
    "<S> we also noticed that the flux in the uvot filters agree with earlier measurements by the international ultraviolet explorer taken between 1993 - 1995 , but spectra taken by the hubble space telescope faint object spectrograph show that wpvs 007 was fainter in the uv by a factor of at least 2 in 1996 . </S>",
    "<S> the flat optical / uv spectrum suggests that some uv extinction is present in the spectrum , but that alone can not at all account for the dramatic fading in the x - ray flux . </S>",
    "<S> most likely we see a partial covering absorber in x - rays . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the current x - ray emission seen from wpvs 007 may also be the emission from the host galaxy .    </S>"
