    "the confinement of color in quantum chromodynamics is explained if color electric fields form flux tubes .",
    "these flux tubes appear readily in the bag model @xcite , but this is a geometric picture rather than a dynamical one .",
    "hooft @xcite and mandelstam @xcite proposed that , just as magnetic flux tubes form in a superconductor @xcite , a condensation of magnetic charge in the qcd vacuum would lead to the formation of electric flux tubes and confinement .",
    "this is the dual superconductor picture of confinement .",
    "the analytical study of the confining flux tube depends largely on a classical , abelian model .",
    "one can connect this model to qcd with t  hooft s idea of abelian dominance @xcite .",
    "starting in qcd , one fixes an abelian gauge and asserts that the dominant degrees of freedom are abelian gauge fields ( from a cartan subalgebra ) and abelian magnetic monopoles , with weak coupling to the non - abelian gauge fields which assume the guise of self - coupled charged fields .",
    "the assumption that the effective interaction of the monopoles causes their condensation leads immediately to the dual superconductor picture .",
    "the validity of this scenario is a subject of research and debate in the lattice gauge theory community @xcite .    in superconductivity ,",
    "one studies the static structure of magnetic flux tubes via a landau - ginzburg theory @xcite .",
    "the simplest landau - ginzburg hamiltonian is that of the abelian higgs model in three dimensions .",
    "classical solutions of the abelian higgs theory have been considered as models of qcd s electric flux tube as well @xcite .",
    "suganuma , sasaki , and toki and their collaborators @xcite , using the formalism proposed by suzuki @xcite , have fixed the effective coupling constants of the abelian higgs model by comparing its flux tube with phenomenology .",
    "there have also been attempts to do so by comparison with the flux tube that emerges in lattice gauge theory @xcite .",
    "success in this program will establish a landau - ginzburg effective hamiltonian of qcd .    in this paper",
    "we present a study not of the statics of the confining flux tube , but of its dynamics .",
    "the flux tube of qcd is not a static object .",
    "creation of flux tubes and their subsequent decay through pair creation offer a detailed model of particle creation in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 collisions @xcite . in the case of nucleus  nucleus collisions , the flux tube has an appreciable transverse extent , so that it can be called a `` color capacitor '' if the color field is coherent across it , or a `` color rope '' @xcite if it is not .",
    "@xmath3 pairs and gluons are created through the schwinger pair creation process @xcite , and they screen the field in the flux tube while carrying away the energy in the form of hadrons .",
    "if the density of created particles is large enough , the quarks and gluons form a quark ",
    "gluon plasma before the final hadronization takes place .",
    "field - theoretic analysis of pair creation and back - reaction in the flux tube @xcite has shown the buildup of particle density and subsequent plasma oscillations .",
    "the methods were applied first to a field region of infinite spatial extent , rather than to a finite flux tube .",
    "eisenberg @xcite carried out a calculation in a cylindrical flux tube of fixed radius , as suggested by the bag model . in our study here , the flux tube is a dynamical field configuration , not a static geometric object .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we set up the electric flux tube in classical electrodynamics coupled to an abelian higgs field via the dual gauge field .",
    "thus the higgs field represents a condensate of magnetic monopoles ; the dual meissner effect confines _ electric _ flux to flux tubes . starting from a static flux tube configuration , we release a density of electric charges in the system and allow them to accelerate and screen the electric field .",
    "the weakening of the electric field allows the flux tube to collapse , but the inertia of the charges carries them into plasma oscillations that build up the field strength again and force open the tube .",
    "the coupling of the plasma oscillations to the higgs field making up the flux tube is the main new feature in our work .",
    "in section  [ sec : eqns ] we describe the dual superconductor theory .",
    "the model contains an abelian gauge field governed by maxwell s equations , with coupling to electric charges and currents on the one hand and to a magnetic higgs field on the other .",
    "the electric currents are treated hydrodynamically ; the higgs field is a classical field that confines electric flux to the tube .",
    "the coupling to the higgs field is accomplished by means of a dual vector potential , as introduced by zwanziger @xcite and used subsequently in @xcite for the static problem and in @xcite for phenomenological modeling .",
    "we impose cylindrical symmetry and we assume @xmath4-independence along the flux tube in the region far from its ends .",
    "nevertheless , we are forced to pay some attention to what happens near the ends of the tube in order to define potentials unambiguously .",
    "we present numerical results in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we set the parameters of the theory in both the type  i and type  ii regimes , and show how plasma oscillations arise .",
    "we consider plasma frequencies both above and below the cutoff for radiation into the higgs vacuum .",
    "the plasma oscillations are accompanied by changes in the radius of the flux tube as the electric pressure from within decreases through screening , only to increase again as the currents overshoot .",
    "we believe that this paper is the first to address the dynamics of an electric flux tube within this model .",
    "it is amusing to note that this physical situation has no counterpart in superconductivity .",
    "while our magnetic higgs field appears in the usual landau - ginzburg theory as an electrically charged condensate , our electric currents can not appear there because there are no magnetic monopoles in nature .",
    "an abrikosov flux tube has to run all the way to the boundary of the sample , where it joins onto the external magnetic field .",
    "our electric flux tube , on the other hand , has a finite ( but large ) length , and the charges at its ends can be screened by the electric currents that flow in it .",
    "we review in the appendix the well - known phenomenon of flux quantization and why it has no effect on a flux tube of finite length .",
    "our classical model for the flux tube is electrodynamics coupled to a scalar magnetic monopole field .",
    "the equations of motion are maxwell s equations with both electric and magnetic sources , plus the klein - gordon equation for the monopoles . the latter is coupled not to the usual vector potential @xmath5 but to the dual potential @xcite @xmath6 , and contains a self - interaction that puts it into the higgs phase .",
    "we make a cylindrically symmetric _ ansatz _ for the fields , and furthermore assume @xmath4-independence far from the sources at the ends of the tube .",
    "we put the electrically charged sources on the @xmath4 axis at @xmath7 , and we assume that all the space - charge effects are localized there .",
    "the central region is defined by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is chosen to exclude the end regions ( see fig .",

    "<S> we study plasma oscillations in a flux tube of the dual superconductor model of t  hooft and mandelstam . a magnetic condensate is coupled to an electromagnetic field by its dual vector potential , and fixed electric charges set up a flux tube . </S>",
    "<S> an electrically charged fluid ( a quark plasma ) flows in the tube and screens the fixed charges via plasma oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate both type i and type ii superconductors , with plasma frequencies both above and below the threshold for radiation into the higgs vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> we find strong radiation of electric flux into the superconductor in all regimes , and argue that this invalidates the use of the simplest dual superconductor model for dynamical problems . </S>"
