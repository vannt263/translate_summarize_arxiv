    "symmetry and its breaking have been a guiding principle in modern physics .",
    "some symmetry restored at high temperatures may be eventually spontaneously broken at low temperatures .",
    "if the breaking scale is high , such spontaneously broken symmetry is hidden and inaccessible to direct observation , but the phase transition might have left some traces , i.e. , topological defects such as monopoles , cosmic strings , and domain walls  @xcite .",
    "thus , topological defects can be a probe of high - energy physics , and they could play an important role in cosmology .    if the discrete symmetry is spontaneously broken , domain walls are formed .",
    "then , in a few hubble times , domain walls start to follow a scaling law , i.e. , the averaged number of the walls per a hubble horizon remains constant over time  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "their energy density decreases more slowly than radiation or matter , and so , domain walls would easily dominate the universe and spoil the success of the standard cosmology . to avoid the cosmological catastrophe , domain walls must either be unstable or remain subdominant until present .",
    "if the discrete symmetry is approximate , domain walls are unstable .",
    "there is an energy bias between the true vacuum and the false vacua , which induces a pressure on the walls .",
    "then , domain walls annihilate when the pressure on the walls becomes larger than the tension of domain walls .",
    "such domain - wall annihilation is so violent that it leads to emission of a large amount of gravitational waves ( gws ) .",
    "thus produced gws retain various information on the uv physics .",
    "for instance , gaugino condensation leads to the formation of domain walls as a result of the spontaneous break down of the discrete r symmetry  @xcite , which is further explicitly broken by a constant term in the superpotential .",
    "the produced gws are expected to be peaked at a frequency determined by the gravitino mass  @xcite .",
    "domain walls and the associated production of gws are also studied in the standard model  @xcite and its extension such as the higgs portal model  @xcite , the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model  @xcite , thermal inflation model  @xcite and the clockwork qcd axion  @xcite , etc .",
    "the domain - wall annihilation also generates baryon asymmetry , if the corresponding scalar field is coupled to either su(2)@xmath0 gauge fields or the @xmath1 current  @xcite .",
    "this is a variant of the so called spontaneous baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to spontaneous baryogenesis scenarios in the slow - roll regime , the baryonic isocurvature perturbation is naturally suppressed by the scaling behavior of the domain - wall network .",
    "in this paper we focus on the annihilation of unstable domain walls , and evaluate its impact on the currently ongoing and planned gw experiments .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to delineate the parameter space in terms of physical parameters where the gws produced by the domain - wall annihilation are within the reach of the present and future experiments .",
    "we also study the domain - wall baryogenesis and its associated gw emission .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we evaluate the frequency and energy density of gws from annihilating domain walls , and show the sensitivity reach of various gw experiments in terms of the domain wall tension and the annihilation temperature . in section 3 , we discuss implications of the detection of the gws . the section 4 is devoted to conclusions .",
    "let us consider a real scalar @xmath5 with a @xmath6-symmetric double - well potential : @xmath7 one can find a static solution of the equation of motion with a boundary condition such that the two vacua are realized at @xmath8 , @xmath9 which represents a domain wall extending along the @xmath10 plane .",
    "the typical width of the domain wall @xmath11 is given by the inverse of the mass of @xmath5 at the potential minimum , @xmath12 .",
    "the surface density , i.e. the tension of the domain wall , is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the ( static ) energy density of @xmath5 .",
    "when the @xmath6 symmetry is spontaneously broken in the early universe , domain walls are formed , and they quickly follow a scaling solution such that there is about one domain wall per hubble horizon  @xcite . then the energy density of the domain walls scales as @xmath15 , and its fraction to the total energy density is @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the hubble parameter and @xmath18 the reduced planck scale and we have defined @xmath19 thus , domain walls start to dominate the universe at @xmath20 , and the universe will be extremely inhomogeneous afterwards . this is the notorious cosmological domain wall problem .    to avoid the cosmological domain wall problem ,",
    "let us introduce a small @xmath6 breaking term , which induces an energy bias between the two vacua and thereby destabilize the walls .",
    "the difference in the energy density between two vacua , @xmath21 , gives a negative pressure in domains with the false vacuum and the walls are accelerated by this pressure . as a result",
    "the domains with the false vacuum collapse at @xmath22 the energy fraction of domain walls at the annihilation is given by @xmath23 thus , domain walls annihilate before they start to dominate the universe if @xmath24 .",
    "the domain - wall annihilation is an efficient source of gws .",
    "the power emitted as gws from a massive object is simply estimated by the quadrupole radiation formula : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a quadrupole moment of the object . in the scaling regime , there is one or a few domain walls in one hubble horizon .",
    "for such a domain wall stretched to the horizon scale , the quadrupole moment is estimated to be @xmath27 .",
    "thus the energy density of gws emitted during one hubble time is given by @xmath28 the present gw energy density emitted at @xmath29 ) normalized by the critical density today is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the density parameter of radiation ( i.e. photons and three massless neutrinos ) and we have defined @xmath32 where we have substituted @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 in the last equality . here and in what follows we assume that the universe is radiation dominated during the epoch of gw emission .",
    "the typical frequency of gw at the emission is of order @xmath36 , and the corresponding frequency at present is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the temperature at @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ ogw ] ) indicates that the present gw spectrum has a peak at the frequency @xmath40 .",
    "the peak gw energy density is given by @xmath41 moreover , according to the numerical simulation  @xcite , the high and low frequency tails of @xmath42 scale as @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "thus the whole gw spectrum is approximated by @xmath45 note that numerical simulation  @xcite also implies that there is a high - frequency cutoff at @xmath46 , corresponding to the width of domain - wall at the annihilation : @xmath47 .",
    "the system of biased domain wall is conveniently parameterized by the domain wall tension @xmath48 and the temperature at which domain walls annihilate , @xmath49 .",
    "there are several conditions on these parameters .",
    "first , domain walls must annihilate before they dominate the universe : @xmath50 .",
    "this leads to @xmath51 on the other hand , we assume that the bias energy is small enough to be regarded as a perturbation to the original scalar potential : @xmath52 . it is translated as @xmath53 the above constraints can be expressed as @xmath54 the gw amplitude takes the largest value if the domain walls annihilate just before they start to dominate the universe , i.e , @xmath55 .",
    "for example , let us consider the following interaction as a possible @xmath6 breaking term , @xmath56 which induces a bias energy @xmath57 between the two vacua .",
    "the constraint ( [ const ] ) is written as @xmath58 if the scalar @xmath5 is in thermal contact with the ambient plasma , the scalar potential may receive thermal corrections . such thermal effects on",
    "the @xmath5 potential is negligible at @xmath59 , if @xmath60 this is almost always stronger than ( [ tann_const2 ] ) unless @xmath61 is extremely small .",
    "we note however that , if @xmath5 has interactions with thermal plasma , the domain - wall evolution can be significantly affected , as we shall see in the next subsection .",

    "it causes a frictional force on domain walls and can change the domain wall evolution in the early epoch .",
    "let us suppose that a @xmath67 particle , which interacts with @xmath5 , is reflected around the domain wall with a probability close to be unity .",

    "is estimated as @xmath83 thus the bias - induced force begins to dominate over @xmath84 at @xmath85 with @xmath86 where we again added a tilde as @xmath87 to represent the annihilation time in the friction regime and distinguish it from the annihilation epoch without friction , @xmath88 , defined in ( [ hdec ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath89 .",
    "after that , the false vacuum region begins to collapse while the friction acts as a repulsive force against the collapse .",
    "if they are balanced , i.e. , @xmath90 , we have @xmath91 hence it is accelerated as time goes on .",
    "actually we find that the typical curvature radius is @xmath92 and the domain wall velocity @xmath93 at @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , the typical time required for collapse of the false vacuum region is @xmath95 it means that the false vacuum collapses within one hubble time around @xmath96 .",

    "there are @xmath101 such regions in the hubble volume , and hence the averaged gw energy density emitted during one hubble time is estimated as @xmath102 substituting ( [ vr_fric ] ) , we find @xmath103 thus the peak gw energy density at @xmath104 is @xmath105 we see that the energy density of the gws is smaller than the case without a friction .    in fig .",

    "the instability scale @xmath112 is sensitive to the top quark mass and it is estimated to be @xmath113gev .",
    "such a metastable vacuum can cause a cosmological problem if the reheating temperature is high or if the higgs field is to be identified with the inflaton  @xcite .",
    "a real singlet scalar field with a large vacuum expectation value is motivated from a viewpoint of the vacuum stability  @xcite .",

    "the domain walls are necessarily produced and we need to introduce a small @xmath6 breaking bias term in the potential to destabilize the domain walls as shown above .    the domain walls in this model experience a frictional force due to their interactions with the ambient plasma . in particular , the higgs field takes a large field value inside the domain wall , which implies that most of the standard model particles ( except for photons ) become heavy inside the wall .",
    "therefore , when those particles scatter with the domain wall , they are likely reflected from the wall , giving a sizable pressure on the wall .",
    "thus , the domain wall in the higgs portal scenario will be in the frictional regime except for the time before it starts to dominate the universe .",
    "note that we need @xmath127 to ensure the absolute stability of the higgs potential .",

    "in contrast to the spontaneous baryogenesis in the slow - roll regime , the scaling behavior of the domain - wall network suppresses the baryonic isocurvature perturbations .    here we estimate the amount of baryon asymmetry induced by domain walls and delineate under which circumstances this scenario is valid .",
    "let us assume that the scalar field @xmath5 is a pseudo scalar , and it is coupled to the lepton current as follows , @xmath130 where @xmath131 is a cut - off scale .",
    "alternatively , we may introduce the coupling to the su(2)@xmath0 gauge fields like @xmath132 and @xmath133 is the field strength of su(2)@xmath0 gauge fields and @xmath134 is its dual . in the latter case , the effective chemical potential is induced only when sphalerons are in equilibrium  @xcite .    in order to generate baryon asymmetry , we need some operator which explicitly violates either baryon or lepton number . as a concrete example , we adopt the @xmath135 operators responsible for the neutrino masses in the seesaw mechanism  @xcite . throughout this paper",
    "we assume that right - handed neutrinos are so heavy that they are not produced in thermal plasma .",
    "the interaction rate for the @xmath135 processes is approximated to be @xmath136 where @xmath137 with @xmath138 denotes the mass of three active neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "for the normal ordering for the neutrino mass differences , @xmath139 , the decoupling temperature of the @xmath140-violating process is @xmath141 where we have assumed the radiation dominated universe .",
    "as long as the reheating temperature @xmath142 is lower than @xmath143 , the @xmath140-violating process is decoupled from the cosmic expansion .",
    "suppose that a domain wall passes through some point in space , where the effective chemical potential , @xmath144 , is induced temporarily .",
    "then , some amount of lepton asymmetry is induced because the chemical potential slightly biases @xmath135 scattering processes , @xmath145 , etc . in the scaling regime , however , domain walls move around randomly and there is no preference for either of the vacua . as a result , no net asymmetry is generated .",
    "on the other hand , when the domain walls decay away due to the energy bias between the vacua , one of the sign of the chemical potential is preferred , leading to a non - zero asymmetry .",
    "the resultant baryon asymmetry is given by  @xcite @xmath146 where we have included the sphaleron conversion factor , @xmath147 is the effective relativistic degrees of freedom contributing to the entropy density , and we used the fact that the asymmetry is generated at the domain wall annihilation .",
    "here , we take @xmath148 for simplicity . in the second equality ,",
    "we have substituted ( [ dl=2 ] ) assuming the radiation - dominated universe .",
    "lastly let us comment on several conditions for the above scenario to work .",
    "first of all , the domain wall must be sufficiently thick so that the dissipation of the asymmetry is neglected , i.e. , @xmath149 . in terms of the tension of the domain wall",
    ", it reads @xmath150 this condition is easily satisfied if @xmath151 is much smaller than unity . for instance , instead of the simple double - well potential ( [ v ] ) , we may consider a flat - top potential which is often considered in a context of thermal inflation  @xcite .",
    "secondly , the domain walls could receive back reactions by the induced lepton asymmetry .",
    "this effect is negligible if the energy stored in the domain walls is larger than the extra energy of the asymmetry : @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the lepton number density . if this inequality is not satisfied , the domain walls would feel the frictional force , and their evolution may be deviated from the simple scaling law .",
    "we impose the condition ( [ back ] ) at the time of domain wall annihilation , and then it reads @xmath154 thus , the domain - wall tension is bounded by the above two conditions ( [ thick ] ) and ( [ back2 ] ) , and the allowed region will be enlarged for a smaller @xmath61 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bg ] we have shown the parameter region where the domain - wall induced leptogenesis successfully explains the present baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "the gray regions are excluded since the constraint ( [ thick ] ) and ( [ back2 ] ) are not satisfied . comparing fig .  [",
    "fig : dw_and_gw1 ] with fig .",
    "[ fig : bg ] , one can see that the gws from the domain wall annihilation are out of the reach of the aligo experiment due to the required @xmath65 , and they may be within the projected sensitivity reach of the experiment using the bose - einstein condensate  @xcite . alternatively ,",
    "if one considers another baryon- or lepton - number violating operator which is effective down to temperatures as low as @xmath155gev , a similar baryogenesis could work at low temperatures so that the gws from the domain wall annihilation can be detected at the aligo experiment .",

    "the gray regions are excluded . ]",
    "we have clarified the parameter regions of the domain wall tension and its annihilation temperature where the produced gws are detected by the ongoing and future experiments .",
    "if the higgs potential is stabilized by a portal scalar , the mass of the portal scalar is likely to smaller than @xmath156gev . in this case",
    "the unstable domain wall may be generated and the tension of the domain wall is likely to be smaller than @xmath157 . with this tension",
    ", the emitted gws can be detected by aligo(o5 ) , decigo , epta , and so on .",
    "we have also discussed the possible effect of a frictional force originated from e.g. , a higgs portal interaction . in this case , the energy density of the gws emitted from the domain wall annihilation is reduced compared to the case without the friction .    finally , we show that the successful baryogenesis can be realized if the scalar forming the domain wall couples to the su(2)@xmath0 gauge fields or @xmath1 current .",
    "we considered a case in which the @xmath158 operator is responsible for the generation of lepton number , and in this case , the produced gws are out of reach of the aligo ( o5 ) .",
