    "since their discovery , topological insulators ( tis ) @xcite have attracted much attention due to their unique surface properties . in three - dimensional tis ,",
    "every surface exhibits linearly dispersing conducting states inside the bulk band gap .",
    "these can be described as dirac fermions and exhibit spin - momentum locking .",
    "if time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) at the surface is broken by an orthogonal net magnetization , the dirac states become massive , i.e. , a gap opens in their energy dispersion .",
    "it has been shown that this generates a chern - simons ( cs ) term in the effective field - theory which imposes a topological magnetoelectric ( tme ) effect @xcite on the surface , where an electric field induces a net in - plane magnetization .",
    "this distinct response to an electromagnetic field is a hallmark of the ti phase",
    ".    magnetic order on the ti surface can be established by doping with @xmath0 transition metals @xcite , proximity coupling to a magnetic insulator in bilayer structures @xcite , or a combination of both @xcite . in @xcite ,",

    "have been suggested , e.g. , related to spintronics @xcite , and several further implications of the tme effect have been discussed , including the formation of magnetic monopoles @xcite , and the interplay with long - range coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "so far , not much focus has been directed at more general classes of magnetic materials .",
    "mostly , it is assumed that the tme effect will occur in the same way as long as a net magnetization is present .",
    "however , several technologically relevant materials do not have a simple ferromagnetic ( fm ) structure , but are instead ferrimagnets ( fims ) or antiferromagnets ( afms ) .",
    "for instance , one of the most prominent materials for spintronics devices is yttrium iron garnet ( yig ) , a fim with a complicated crystal structure @xcite . in yig ,",
    "an enhancement of the magnetization has been recently observed in a bilayer structure yig - bi@xmath1se@xmath2 , where bi@xmath1se@xmath2 is doped with cr @xcite .",
    "it is thus natural to ask if and how the topological effects will manifest itself in multicomponent fmis , fims or afm insulators . in afms",
    ", there is no net magnetization ( except in some cases for special surface orientations @xcite ) .",
    "however , a gap can still be opened at the dirac points , as in the fm and fim cases , by means of magnetic doping in the ti .",
    "such a system has recently been realized experimentally @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study a bilayer heterostructure consisting of a bipartite magnetic insulator ( bmi ) and a ti .",
    "we show that , depending on the microscopic parameters of the bmi , the tme effect can take the opposite sign on the two sublattices , turning the overall electric - field response from a tme effect into a topological staggered - field ( tse ) effect .",
    "our calculation is to be understood as a proof of principle , as the model we employ is simplified and may not suffice to make quantitative predictions . on the other hand , we are able to obtain fully analytic solutions within a field - theoretic approach that accounts for the fermionic quantum fluctuations on both the bmi and the ti surfaces .",
    "we will derive the effective lagrangian , revealing the structure of the magnetoelectric response , and the landau - lifshitz equation ( lle ) of the interfacial magnetization dynamics .",
    "we work in gaussian units and set @xmath3 .",
    "all calculations are done at zero - temperature .",

    "we discuss the non - topological fluctuation effects originating with the electrons on the bmi surface in section  [ sec : integratechi ] , before we move on to the topological effects that are revealed upon integrating out the dirac states in section  [ sec : tse ] .",
    "we summarize our results in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "describing the heterostructure , one has to account for the contributions from the bulk of the bmi , the surfaces of the bmi and the ti , hopping across the interface due to proximity , and coulomb interactions between the dirac electrons at the interface . the bulk of the ti is required to guarantee the existence of the topological surface states , but does not appear explicitly . the model system is illustrated in fig .",
