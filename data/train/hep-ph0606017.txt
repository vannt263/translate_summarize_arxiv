    "the standard model of the particles has been found to be in agreement with experiment in many of its aspects .",
    "however , in the framework of the standard model top is the only quark which has a mass in the same order as the electroweak symmetry breaking scale , @xmath0 gev , whereas all other observed fermions have masses which are a tiny fraction of this scale .",
    "this huge mass might be a hint that top quark plays an essential role in the electroweak symmetry breaking . on the other hand , the reported experimental data from tevatron on the top quark properties are still limited and no significant deviations from the standard model predictions has been seen @xcite",
    ". the number of observed top quark events in the tevatron experiment is increasing and now reaching to the order of a few hundred .",
    "several properties of the top quark have been already examined .",
    "they consist of studies of the @xmath1 production cross section , the top quark mass measurement , the measurement of @xmath2 helicity in the top decay , the search for fcnc and many other studies @xcite .",
    "however , it is expected that top quark properties can be examined with high precision at the lhc due to very large statistics @xcite .",
    "since the dominant top quark decay mode is into a @xmath2 boson and a bottom quark , the @xmath3 coupling can be investigated accurately . within the standard model , the top quark decay via electroweak interaction before hadronization .",
    "this important property is one the consequences of its large mass .",
    "hence , the spin information of the top quark is transferred to its decay daughters .",
    "thus , the top quark spin can be used as a powerful mean for investigation of any possible new physics .",
    "there are many studies for testing the top quark decay properties at hadron colliders .",
    "for instance , the non - standard effects on the full top width have been investigated in the minimal supersymmetric standard model and in the technicolor model @xcite .",
    "some studies have been performed on the effects of anomalous @xmath3 couplings on the top width and some constraints have been applied on the anomalous couplings @xcite .",
    "there have been some studies on the top quark rare decays .",
    "the two - body decay of the top quark , @xmath4 , has been considered within the noncommutative standard model in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the semi - leptonic decay of the top quark , @xmath5 , in the noncommutative standard model .",
    "the noncommutativity in space - time is a possible generalization of the usual quantum mechanics and quantum field theory to describe the physics at very short distances of the order of the planck length , since the nature of the space - time changes at these distances .",
    "the noncommutative spaces can be realized as spaces where coordinate operators , @xmath6 , satisfy the commutation relations : @xmath7 = i\\theta_{\\mu \\nu},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is a real antisymmetric tensor with the dimension of @xmath9^{2}$ ] .",
    "we note that a space - time noncommutativity , @xmath10 , might lead to some problems with unitarity and causality @xcite",
    ". a noncommutative version of an ordinary field theory can be obtained by replacing all ordinary products with moyal @xmath11 product defined as @xcite : @xmath12 the approach to the noncommutative field theory based on the moyal product and seiberg - witten maps allows the generalization of the standard model to the case of noncommutative space - time , keeping the original gauge group and particle content @xcite .",
    "seiberg - witten maps relate the noncommutative gauge fields and ordinary fields in commutative theory via a power series expansion in @xmath13 .",
    "indeed the noncommutative version of the standard model is a lorentz violating theory , but the seiberg witten map shows that the zeroth order of the theory is the lorentz invariant standard model .",
    "the effects of the noncommutative space - time on some rare and collider processes have been considered in @xcite .",
    "the leptonic decay of the @xmath2 and @xmath14 bosons on the noncommutative space - time have been studied in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , a short introduction for the ncsm is given .",
    "section 3 is dedicated to present the noncommutative effects on the @xmath15 decay .",
    "finally , section 4 concludes the paper .",
    "the action of the ncsm can be obtained by replacing the ordinary products in the action of the classical sm by the moyal products and then matter and gauge fields are replaced by the appropriate seiberg - witten expansions .",
    "the action of ncsm can be written as : @xmath16 we just consider the fermions ( quarks and leptons ) .",
    "the fermionic matter part in a very compact way is : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is generation index and @xmath19 are : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the well - known lepton and quark doublets , respectively .",
    "the seiberg - witten maps for the noncommutative fermion and vector fields yield : @xmath23 = \\psi - \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}v_{\\mu}\\partial_{\\nu}\\psi + \\frac{i}{8}\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}[v_{\\mu},v_{\\nu}]\\psi + o(\\theta^{2}),\\nonumber \\\\ \\widehat{v_{\\alpha } } & = & \\widehat{v_{\\alpha}}[v ] = v_{\\alpha } + \\frac{1}{4}\\theta^{\\mu\\nu } \\{\\partial_{\\mu}v_{\\alpha } + f_{\\mu\\alpha } , v_{\\nu}\\ } + o(\\theta^{2}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are ordinary fermion and gauge fields , respectively .",
    "noncommutative fields are denoted by a hat . for a full description and review of the ncsm ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the @xmath26 vertex in the ncsm up to the order of @xmath27 can be written as @xcite : @xmath28p_{l}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this vertex is similar to the vertex of @xmath2 decays into a lepton and anti - neutrino @xcite .",
    "the effective vertex in eq.([vertex ] ) contains @xmath31 and the momenta of the involved particles . in order to simplify the calculations we ignore of the masses of the @xmath32 quark and leptons . by using the dirac equations , the vertices have simpler forms .",
    "for instance , the eq.([vertex ] ) can be replaced by the following : @xmath33 according to the fig.[eventplane ] , the event plane defines the ( x - z ) plane .",
    "the z - axis is determined by the momentum of the lepton and @xmath34 is the angle between momentum of the lepton and the spin of the top quark in the rest frame of the top quark . using the following identities : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and if we assume that @xmath37 is in the ( x - z ) plane the squared matrix element for the reaction @xmath38 has the following form : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the polarization four - vector of the top quark .",
    "the differential rate for @xmath42 at born approximation can be written as : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the three - body phase space is parametrized as follows @xcite : @xmath46 by defining @xmath47 and @xmath48 and from fig.[eventplane ] one has : @xmath49 where @xmath50 after replacing eq.([fv ] ) in eq.([mx ] ) and integration over two euler angles and in the @xmath2 narrow width approximation , @xmath51 , the double differential @xmath52 distributions in the point - like four fermion limit is : @xmath53\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the scale of the noncommutativity and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are defined in the following forms : @xmath57    in fig.[fig : topwidth ] , in the left the three - body top decay width is presented as a function of noncommutativity scale .",
    "this figure shows that the noncommutative effect is negligible for @xmath58 gev and is not observable .",
    "the right plot in fig.[fig : topwidth ] shows the energy spectrum for the charged lepton in the top quark decay at born approximation for the ordinary sm ( dashed curve ) and for when @xmath59 gev in the ncsm ( solid curve ) .",
    "it shows that the probability of having very low energy charged leptons , @xmath60 or @xmath61 gev , is high because of the noncommutative effects .",
    "however , from the experimental point of view this effect is not observable since we are restricted by the detector resolution .",
    "the detected leptons with transverse momentum less than 15 gev are usually not reliable and rejected in the experiments .",
    "it is noticeable that , this effect is present only for low values of noncommutativity scale . the lepton energy spectrum is matched with the sm case for @xmath62 gev .",
    "+ it is more useful to express the eq.([dwidth ] ) in the following way : @xmath63 where @xmath64 , _ correlation coefficient _ or _ spin analyzing power _ , is : @xmath65 in the ordinary standard model and in the limit of vanishing the lepton masses , @xmath66 is independent of @xmath67 and is equal to one @xcite . as a result of eq.([dwidth1 ] ) , in the ncsm the angular distribution of a polarized top decay has the same form as the ordinary sm : @xmath68 where @xmath69 describes the direction of the flight of lepton in the rest frame of the top quark and @xmath70 denots the pauli matrices .",
    "however , according to fig.[fig : corrcoef ] in the ncsm the spin analyzing power , @xmath66 , depends on the noncommutativity scale .",
    "fig.[fig : corrcoef ] reveals a significant deviation from the sm even for the case that @xmath71 is around 1 tev .",
    "it is well known that top quarks produced in hadron colliders are scarcely polarized . as a result , the correlations between top spin and anti - top spin in the @xmath1 is considered @xcite . in order to illustrate we consider the dileptonic decay of the @xmath1 events in hadron colliders :",
    "@xmath72 the double differential angular distribution of the leptons coming form",
    "the top and anti - top in the ordinary sm is @xcite : @xmath73 where @xmath74@xmath75 is the angle between the direction of the @xmath76 in the rest frame of the @xmath77 and the @xmath77 direction in the @xmath1 center of mass .",
    "@xmath78 is the number of top pair events where both quarks have spin up or spin down and @xmath79 is the number of top pair events where one quark is spin up and the other is spin down .",
    "eq.([spintt ] ) shows the strong dependence of the experimantal observable , @xmath80 , to the spin analyzing power ( @xmath66 ) . for the @xmath1 production at the tevatron ,",
    "the sm predicts @xmath81 .",
    "the d measurement for the quantity @xmath80 is @xmath82 @xcite , which is not very good due to low statistics .",
    "having a good measurement for the @xmath80 and knowing the depenedency of @xmath78 and @xmath79 on the noncommutativity scale might provide valuable information concerning the noncommutativity scale .",
    "just as an example , using this rough measurement from d and ignoring of any dependency of @xmath78 and @xmath79 on the noncommutativity scale yields @xmath83 gev .",
    "the noncommutative effects only show up for the low values of the noncommutativity scale in the lepton energy spectrum from the decay of top quarks .",
    "the effects are not visible for low values of the noncommutativity scale because of the experimental restrictions . however , the charged lepton spin correlation coefficient is sensitive to the noncommutativity scale from very low values to 1 tev .",
    "it is a powerful tool for investigation of non - sm effects , particularly in @xmath1 events .",
