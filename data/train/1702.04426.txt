    "models of particles with infinite - range interactions have a long history in nuclear physics dating back to the pioneering works of wigner and dyson @xcite and in condensed matter physics in studies describing spin glass and spin liquid states of matter @xcite .",
    "more recently , kitaev @xcite formulated and studied a majorana fermion version of the model with all - to - all random interactions first proposed by sachdev and ye @xcite . the resulting syk model , defined by the hamiltonian ( [ hsyk ] ) below , is solvable in the limit of large number @xmath1 of fermions and exhibits a host of intriguing properties .",
    "the syk model is believed to be holographic dual of extremal black hole horizons in ads@xmath0 and has been argued to possess remarkable connections to information theory , many - body thermalization and quantum chaos @xcite .",
    "various extensions of the syk model have been put forth containing supersymmetry @xcite , interesting quantum phase transition @xcite , higher dimensional extensions @xcite , as well as a version that does not require randomness @xcite . given its fascinating properties it would be of obvious interest to have an experimental realization of the syk model or its variants . thus far a realization of the sachdev - ye model ( with complex fermions ) has been proposed using ultracold gases @xcite and a protocol for digital quantum simulation of both the complex and majorana fermion versions of the model have been discussed @xcite .",
    "a natural realization of the syk model in a solid state system is thus far lacking .",
    "recent years have seen numerous proposals for experimental realizations of unpaired majorana zero modes in solid state systems @xcite , with compelling experimental evidence for their existence gradually mounting in several distinct platforms @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to propose a physical realization of the syk model in one of these platforms .",
    "the syk hamiltonian we wish to implement is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 are random independent coupling constants and @xmath4 represent the majorana zero mode operators that obey the canonical anticommutation relations @xmath5    the proposed device , depicted in fig.[fig1 ] , employs an interface between a 3d ti and an ordinary superconductor such as nb or pb . fu and kane @xcite showed theoretically that magnetic vortices in such an interface host unpaired majorana zero modes and signatures consistent with this prediction have been reported in bi@xmath0te@xmath6/nbse@xmath0 heterostructures @xcite . under ordinary circumstances",
    "these vortices tend to form an abrikosov lattice and the low - energy effective theory is dominated by two - fermion terms @xmath7 with the hoping amplitudes @xmath8 decaying exponentially with the distance between vortex sites @xmath9 .",
    "four - fermion interaction terms of the type required to implement the syk hamiltonian ( [ hsyk ] ) are generically also present but are subdominant and also decay exponentially with distance . realizing the syk model in this setup therefore entails two key challenges : ( i ) one must find a way to suppress the two - fermion tunneling terms and ( ii ) render the four - fermion interactions",
    "effectively infinite - ranged .",
    "in addition the four - fermion coupling constants @xmath3 must be sufficiently random . in the following",
    "we show how these challenges can be overcome by judicious engineering of various aspects of the device depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the first challenge can be met by tuning the surface state of the ti into its global neutrality point such that the chemical potential @xmath10 lies at the dirac point . at the neutrality point",
    "the interface superconductor is known to acquire an extra chiral symmetry which prohibits any two - fermion terms @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the symmetry requires @xmath11 and the low - energy hamiltonian is then dominated by the four - fermion terms @xcite .",
    "the second requirement of effectively infinite - ranged interactions can be satisfied by localizing all majorana zero modes in the same region of space . in our proposed device",
    "this is achieved by fabricating a hole in the sc layer as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . if the sample is cooled in a weak applied magnetic field an integer number @xmath1 of magnetic flux quanta can be trapped in the hole .",
    "the sc phase @xmath12 will then wind by @xmath13 around the hole , forming effectively an @xmath1-fold vortex with @xmath1 majorana zero modes bound to the hole .",
    "if furthermore the hole is designed to have an irregular shape the majorana wavefunctions will be random and their overlaps will give rise to the required randomness in the coupling constants @xmath3 . this randomness is related to random classical trajectories inside such a hole , or ` billiards ' as it is commonly called in the quantum chaos literature @xcite .    in the rest of the paper we provide the necessary background on our proposed system and support its relation to the syk model by physical arguments and by detailed model calculations .",
    "we first review the fu - kane model @xcite for the ti / sc interface and numerically calculate the majorana wavefunctions localized in a hole threaded by @xmath1 magnetic flux quanta in the presence of disorder . assuming that the constituent electrons interact via screened coulomb potential",
    "we then explicitly calculate the four - fermion coupling constants @xmath3 between the majorana zero modes .",
    "we finally use these as input data for the many - body majorana hamiltonian which we diagonalize numerically for @xmath1 up to 32 and study its thermodynamic properties , level statistics , as well as two- and four - point correlators .",
    "we show that these behave precisely as expected of the syk model with random independent couplings .",
    "we also discuss the effect of small residual two - fermion terms that will inevitably be present in a realistic device and propose ways to experimentally detect signatures of the syk physics using tunneling spectroscopy .",
    "the surface of a canonical 3d ti , such as bi@xmath0se@xmath6 , hosts a single massless dirac fermion protected by time reversal symmetry .",
    "when placed in proximity of an ordinary superconductor the surface state is described by the fu - kane hamiltonian @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the nambu spinor and @xmath16+\\tau^x\\delta_1-\\tau^y\\delta_2\\ ] ] here @xmath17 is the velocity of the surface state , @xmath18 denotes the momentum operator , @xmath19 is the sc order parameter and @xmath20 , @xmath21 are pauli matrices in spin and nambu spaces , respectively . to describe the geometry depicted in fig.[fig1 ] we take @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the polar angle and @xmath24 denotes the hole radius .",
    "the vector potential is taken to yield total flux through the hole @xmath25 with @xmath26 the sc flux quantum and the contour @xmath27 encircles the hole at a radius well beyond the effective magnetic penetration depth @xmath28 .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ sym1 ] ) respects the particle - hole symmetry generated by @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , where @xmath31 denotes complex conjugation . for a purely real gap function @xmath32 and zero magnetic field @xmath33",
    ", it also obeys the physical time reversal symmetry @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) . in the presence of vortices",
    "@xmath32 becomes complex and the time reversal symmetry is broken .",
    "the fu - kane model with vortices therefore falls into symmetry class d in the altland - zirnbauer classification @xcite which , in accordance with ref .",
    "@xcite , implies a z@xmath0 classification for the zero modes associated with vortices .",
    "physically , this means that a system with total vorticity @xmath36 will have @xmath37 exact zero modes , in accord with the expectation that any even number of majorana zero modes will generically hybridize and form complex fermions at non - zero energies .",
    "when @xmath38 , hamiltonian ( [ sym1 ] ) also respects a fictitious time reversal symmetry with @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , even in the presence of vortices . at the neutrality point , the two symmetries @xmath41 and @xmath42 define a bdi class with chiral symmetry @xmath43 .",
    "this , in accordance with ref.@xcite , implies an integer classification of zero modes associated with point defects . a system with total vorticity @xmath36 will thus exhibit @xmath44 exact zero modes , irrespective of the precise geometric arrangement of the individual vortices and other details .",
    "this remains true in the presence of any disorder that does not break the @xmath42 symmetry .",
    "specifically randomness in @xmath17 and @xmath32 will not split the zero modes but random contributions to @xmath10 will .",
    "another way to establish the existence of exact zero modes in the hamiltonian ( [ sym1 ] ) with @xmath38 is to recognize it as a version of the jackiw - rossi hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "an index theorem for this hamiltonian , conjectured by jackiw and rossi and later proven by weinberg @xcite , equates the number @xmath1 of its exact zero modes in region @xmath45 to the total vorticity @xmath46 contained in that region .",
    "a region threaded by @xmath36 magnetic flux quanta will thus contain @xmath1 exact zero modes .",
    "the existence and properties of the zero modes in the fu - kane hamiltonian have been extensively tested by analytic and numerical approaches for a single vortex @xcite , pair of vortices @xcite , periodic abrikosov lattices @xcite as well as the `` giant vortex '' geometry @xcite similar to our proposed setup .",
    "this body of work firmly established the existence of exact majorana zero modes for @xmath38 in accordance with the jackiw - rossi - weinberg index theorem . away from neutrality",
    "it was found that the zero modes are split due to two - fermion tunneling terms @xmath47 where the constant of proportionality is related to the wavefunction overlap between @xmath48 and @xmath4 . in addition , it has been found that for a singly quantized vortex at neutrality the zero mode is separated from the rest of the spectrum by a gap @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the sc gap magnitude far from the vortex .",
    "we shall see that for a judiciously chosen hole size this convenient hierarchy of energy scales remains in place with @xmath1 zero modes separated by a large gap from the rest of the spectrum .",
    "having established a convenient platform that hosts @xmath1 majorana zero modes with wavefunctions localized in the same region of space we now proceed to derive the effective low - energy theory in terms of the majorana zero mode operators @xmath4 . to this end",
    "we write the full second - quantized hamiltonian of the system as @xmath51 here @xmath52 stands for the part of the fu - kane hamiltonian ( [ sym1 ] ) that obeys the fictitious time - reversal symmetry @xmath42 and exhibits therefore @xmath1 exact zero modes .",
    "@xmath53 contains all the remaining fermion bilinears that break @xmath42 such as the chemical potential term .",
    "@xmath54 defines the four - fermion interactions that have been neglected thus far but will play pivotal role in the physics of the syk model we wish to study .",
    "we assume that electrons are subject to screened coulomb interactions described by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the interaction potential and @xmath57 is the electron charge density operator .",
    "now imagine we have solved the single - electron problem defined by hamiltonian @xmath58 for the device geometry sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] with @xmath1 flux quanta threaded through the hole .",
    "we thus have the complete set of single - particle eigenfunctions @xmath59 and eigenenergies @xmath60 of @xmath61 .",
    "the corresponding second quantized hamiltonian can then be written in a diagonal form @xmath62 where @xmath63 are the eigenmode operators .",
    "the sum over @xmath64 is restricted to the positive energy eigenvalues and @xmath65 is a constant representing the ground state energy . at the neutrality point , according to our preceding discussion , @xmath1 of the @xmath66 eigenmodes coincide with the exact zero modes mandated by the jackiw - rossi - weinberg index theorem .",
    "we denote these @xmath4 with @xmath67 . because @xmath68 these modes do not contribute to the hamiltonian ( [ abel11 ] ) .",
    "the zero mode eigenfunctions @xmath69 can be chosen as the eigenstates of the p - h symmetry generator @xmath41 .",
    "they then satisfy the reality condition @xmath70 which implies that @xmath71 ; the zero modes are majorana operators .    as mentioned before the @xmath1 zero modes are separated by a gap from the rest of the spectrum",
    "as long as @xmath53 and @xmath72 remain small compared to this gap we may construct the effective low - energy theory of the system by simply projecting onto the part of the hilbert space generated by @xmath1 majorana zero modes . in practical terms this is accomplished by inverting eq.([abel12 ] ) to obtain @xmath73 then substituting @xmath74 into @xmath53 and @xmath72 and retaining only those terms that contain zero mode operators @xmath4 but no finite - energy eigenmodes .",
    "one thus obtains @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 is the charge density associated with the pair of zero modes @xmath48 and @xmath4 .",
    "we observe that at the neutrality point when @xmath78 the low - energy effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) coincides with the syk model .",
    "( [ heffk ] ) and ( [ heffj ] ) allow us to calculate the relevant two- and four - fermion coupling constants from the knowledge of the majorana wavefunctions in the non - interacting system .",
    "we shall carry out this program in section iv below for a specific physically relevant model system . here",
    "we finish by discussing some general properties of hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) that follow from symmetry considerations .",
    "the reality condition ( [ real1 ] ) for the majorana wavefunction implies the following spinor structure of @xmath69 in the nambu space @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a two - component complex spinor .",
    "we thus have @xmath81 .",
    "the charge density is thus purely real and antisymmetric under @xmath82 . in the simplest case",
    "the @xmath83-breaking part of the fu - kane hamiltonian will simply be @xmath84 . in this case",
    "( [ heffk ] ) implies that @xmath85 .",
    "thus @xmath86 is purely real and antisymmetric as required for @xmath87 to be hermitian .",
    "because of the anticommutation property ( [ hsyk2 ] ) of the majorana operators it is clear that only the fully antisymmetric part of @xmath88 contributes to the hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) . as defined in eq .",
    "( [ heffj ] ) @xmath88 is already antisymmetric under @xmath82 and @xmath89 due to the antisymmetry @xmath90 . with this in mind",
    "we can rewrite hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) in a more convenient form @xmath91 with @xmath92 now fully antisymmetric . in the following",
    "we will be interested in situations where coupling constants are random and will characterize the coupling strengths by two parameters @xmath93 and @xmath94 defined by @xmath95 where the bar represents an ensemble average over randomness .",
    "when the number of majorana fermions @xmath1 is large the syk model becomes analytically solvable in the low - energy limit .",

    "it is important to note that the low - frequency behaviors of @xmath124 and @xmath125 are quite different with the former saturating at @xmath126 and the latter divergent .",
