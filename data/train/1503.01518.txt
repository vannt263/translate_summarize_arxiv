    ", the system of differential equations  ( [ eq:003 ] ) has a steady state solution due to the environment - induced relaxation . to find them , we write the system in  ( [ eq:003 ] ) as a vectorial diffential equation @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is a time - independent square matrix and @xmath105    and set @xmath106 , where @xmath89 stands for steady state . to solve this ,",

    "since in general stokes production is favoured over anti - stokes ( as it becomes clear in a few lines ) , whenever these scattering processes take place , the distribution of phonons in the sample is not determined solely by temperature anymore .",
    "one of the central results in the paper is to show the behaviour of the stokes - anti - stokes field intensities in terms of the power of the pumping laser . in the steady state regime",

    "so far our analysis has been done for continuous pumping , which allows for well behaved steady state solutions .",

    "the presence of the _ sas _ correlation in diamond is unquestionable , given the results of the correlation function @xmath36 @xcite .",

    ". however , the fact that @xmath88 is generally larger for tblg , as compared to ab - blg ( see data in fig.[blgallt ] ) is not expected .",
    "first , the tblg was engineered for resonance with the anti - stokes photon emission .",
    "therefore it is expected that this sample would have a stronger cooling channel , and it would actually exhibit lower temperatures than the ab - blg .",
    "second , this expectation is proven to be correct by the lower shift in phonon frequency observed for tblg , as shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "therefore , the tblg * can not * be hotter than the ab - blg , and the result obtained with eq.[eq:15 ] is proven to be inconsistent .       three different fittings for the @xmath7 data from tblg @xcite .",

    "one can also argue on how sensitive the data fitting is with respect to the parameters choice .",
    "parameter values outside the errors given in table i of the paper do not fit the data properly .",
    "figure[tblg - allfits ] shows three possible fittings of the tblg data .",
    "the red line is the best fit , as given in the paper .",
    "the black and blue lines were obtained by considering that the @xmath7 is ruled by pure _ sas _ phenomena and by pure thermal phenomena , respectively .",
    "notice that these two fitting options do not fit the data properly .",
    "the worse fitting is obtained using the pure thermal phenomena , demonstrating the predominance of the _ sas _ phenomena .",
    "figure[tvssas ] presents the separate contribution from the thermal phonons ( dashed blue lines ) and from the _ sas _ phenomena ( dotted black lines ) to the @xmath7 data fitting ( solid black lines ) for diamond ( a ) , tblg ( b ) and ab - blg ( c ) . as discussed in the paper , for diamond and tblg ,",
    "the _ sas _",
    "phenomena dominates until large laser powers , when the thermal phonons overcome . for ab - blg , the _",
    "phenomena is minor .",
    "it remains to be discussed the effect of @xmath183 , which is important when resonance effects are in place , i.e. when either stokes or anti - stokes has a stronger coupling to the pumping field . considering @xmath184 and setting @xmath185 and @xmath186 , once again as long as @xmath187 , eq.(7 ) in the paper changes to : @xmath188 for @xmath189 , this expression is well approximated by @xmath190 which approximately reduces to : @xmath191        in non - resonant scattering , @xmath199 is expected due to time - reversal symmetry .",
    "this is the case for diamond @xcite . if resonance with electronic states exists , but there is not much difference between the resonance with the _ s _ and _ as _ photon emission , then @xmath200",
    "this is the case of ab - blg , where the density of states does not vary too much between the _ s _ and _ as _ photon energies @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of tblg , the electronic structure is engineered to exhibit specific resonance with the _ as _ photon emission @xcite , i.e. @xmath201 .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking , eq.[eq:13b ] from this supplemental information should be used to fit the data , rather than eq.7 from the paper .",
    "the value of @xmath202 is easily obtained from the data if we consider that this parameter rules the enhancement of @xmath61 from tblg as compared to ab - blg . from table",
    "i in the paper and eq.[eq:13a ] from this supplemental information we obtain @xmath203 .",
    "we now add @xmath204 in eq.[eq:13a ] from this supplemental information and fit the tblg data with @xmath205 , which is consistently the value for ab - blg .",
    "this means that the effect of resonance in tblg is now accounted for with @xmath202 .",
    "contribution from the thermal phonons and from the _ sas _ phenomena in the fitting of @xmath7 from ( a ) diamond , ( b ) tblg and ( c ) ab - blg .",
    "the symbols are the experimental data .",
    "the solid black lines are the best fits using eq.(7 ) from the paper , with the parameters shown in table i. the dashed blue and the dotted black lines give the separate contribution from the thermal phonons and from the _ sas _ phenomena , respectively . ]    the data fitting gives @xmath206mw@xmath64 and ( @xmath67 } = 295 + ( 15\\pm 1)p_l{\\rm [ mw]}$ ] ) .",
    "therefore , considering the possibility of @xmath183 in our analysis actually enhances the importance of the _ sas _ phenomena in tblg by almost one order of magnitude ( compare with the value for @xmath207 in table i ) .",
    "furthermore , the dependence on temperature decreases to half of the value obtained for ab - blg , which is ( @xmath67 } = 295 + 30p_l{\\rm [ mw]}$ ] ) , consistent with the g band frequency dependence observed in fig.7 of ref.@xcite .",
    "although this picture is fully consistent , we chose to keep the simpler equation in the paper since the general picture does not change , and the discussion is simpler ."
