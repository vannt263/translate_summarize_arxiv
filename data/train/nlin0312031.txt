    "the spectral statistics of these regular quantum graphs agrees again very well with cue statistics .",
    "recall that the unitary matrix @xmath173 of size @xmath174 = 1024 has @xmath175 nonzero matrix elements which do , however , take on only 4 different ( complex ) values ! we have thus constructed extremely non - random matrices which still show universal random matrix statistics and have thereby shown that the bgs - conjecture is valid far beyond regimes previously thought to be included in the conjecture .     and nearest neighbour spacing distribution @xmath136 for binary de bruijn graph of order @xmath176 with @xmath177.,height=188 ]    similar numerical results were also found for the spectra of the laplacian of regular graphs @xcite .",
    "a laplacian on a @xmath33 - regular undirected , loop - less graph @xmath0 is @xmath178 and is thus a symmetric matrix whose non - zero matrix elements take on the values 1 or @xmath33 only . when averaging over sets of @xmath33 - regular graphs agreement with goe statistics was found .",
    "this underlines once more that the origin of universality in spectral statistics lies not in the randomness of the matrix elements .",
    "we introduce a decomposition of certain regular quantum graphs which separates the quantum propagator on a graph into a topological part containing the connectivity matrices and a trivial part containing the quantum scattering information at the vertices .",
    "this allows one to implement global symmetries on the graph by choosing the connectivity matrices according to desired symmetry properties .",
    "we demonstrate that the complexity in the quantum spectrum ( which may be seen to take on its maximal value when the statistics coincides with rmt ) can here be linked to the amount of complexity contained in the set of permutation matrices building up the quantum graph .",
    "we present examples , where for a given graph and a fixed coin matrix , we were able to construct anything from poisson to rmt - statistics just by changing the set of connectivity matrices . by doing so ,",
    "we leave the local properties of the graph invariant , but change the way in which incoming and outgoing channels between vertices are connected and thus the global structure of the wave dynamics .",
    "we take this concept to its extreme by demonstrating numerically that unitary matrices representing 2-regular quantum graphs whose non - zero matrix elements take on only four different values still follow cue statistics for de bruijn graphs .",
    "we believe that our results open up new perspectives in understanding universality in spectral statistics .",
    "it transforms the question from a continuous into an essentially discrete problem focusing on the way local scattering processes are connected and condensing the parameter space to an absolute minimum , ( namely four - dimensional ) . +",
