    "there are several reasons for this : even in untreated patients , according to our model , t - cells respond very rapidly , eliminating the pathogen before it has time to grow ( figure [ figure1abc ]  a ) , so there is only a relatively small immune response to the presence of the pathogen , and little change in viral load ( figure [ figure1abc ]  b ) .",
    "the system remains relatively unaffected by increases in pathogen growth rate until @xmath10 reaches a critical point where the model immune system can not completely eliminate the pathogen , and then there are predator - prey cycles .",
    "[ note that inclusion of a logistic growth term means that the pathogen can reach a carrying capacity , @xmath11 , but will not experience runaway growth . ] with the addition of drug therapy ( figure [ figure1abc ]  c ) of efficacy @xmath44 ( see appendix ) , baseline viral load is suppressed to 25 rna copies ( ml@xmath30 ) and opportunistic infection results in a small , slow rise and fall in viral load , rather than a burst of viremia .",
    "if baseline viral load is suppressed further , then there is no appreciable change in viral load .",
    "while different parameters could be explored , we believe that there is a need to generate more biologically realistic models . first , the majority of patients with viral loads below 50 copies / ml who have been examined with more sensitive assays have viral loads that are still detectable , i.e. been 1 and 50 copies / ml ( dornadula et al.,1999 , di mascio , 2003b ) .",

    "a smaller @xmath10 thus results in a larger amplitude viral transient , with @xmath124 days@xmath30 resulting in the largest blip , and successively larger values of @xmath10 resulting in smaller blip sizes ( figure [ figure 5]b ) . *",
    "increasing the half - saturation constant for cd8 + proliferation , @xmath61 in ( [ fa ] ) has a _ positive _ effect on the sizes of the resulting viral transients , as this allows greater pathogen growth before an immune response begins , while increasing the half - saturation for pathogen growth in the activation function @xmath96 ( [ eq5 ] ) has a _ negative _ effect on blip size , as the slope of the  activation curve \" for target cells becomes gentler ( figures [ figure 5]c , d ) .",
    "a complex but more biologically realistic version of this model would allow proliferation of the antigen - specific target pool - yielding more activated target cells at the effector stage - and might also allow infection of the proliferating division classes .",
    "this would boost the amplitude of the transient and lower the value of @xmath106 required to produce detectable viremia , thus addressing two flaws in the present model ( [ eqs6 ] ) .",
    "we explore both of these options below .",
    "cd4 + t cells as well as cd8 + t cells undergo programmed proliferation upon exposure to antigen ( lee et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "these proliferating cells are more susceptible to hiv infection than resting cells .",

    "undergo eight divisions , so there are eight division classes with the assumption of effector status after the fourth division .",
    "cd4 + t cells have slower kinetics than cd8 + t cells , and undergo fewer programmed cycles of proliferation .",

    "infected cells for target cell population 1 do not rise at all , so all new viral replication and thus the entire viral transient comes from newly infected cells in population 2 . finally , the above example shows that opportunistic infection will produce viral transients of typical size and duration in numerous models with suitable mechanisms for generating robust low steady - state viral loads .",
    "models of hiv infection have generally not included detailed models of immune responses .",
    "when immune responses are included in such models , they tend to be very stylized , phenomenological rather than mechanistic , and with simple predator - prey type dynamics ( cf . , nowak and bangham , 1996 ; wodarz et al . , 2000",
    "; wodarz and nowak , 2000 ) .",
    "recent experimental work has shown that both the cd4 + and cd8 + classes of t cells undergo bursts of proliferation on encounter with antigen , and that programmed proliferative responses continue even if antigen is removed ( badovinac et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "this is a feature that has not previously been included in hiv models , and one that is especially important to consider when simulating the effects of coinfection - infection with a growing pathogen - on chronically infected hiv patients .",
    "here we have built a set of models of increasing realism that captures the proliferative response of both cd8 + and cd4 + t cells , and the dynamics of chronic hiv infection in the presence of opportunistic infection . in order to tie our models to data we have focused on explaining the rare occurrences of transient episodes of viremia , or viral blips , that are seen in patients treated with potent antiretroviral therapy .",
    "blip frequency is independent of time on treatment , and if viral loads were to continue to fall towards extinction as they do in most standard models , one would expect the occurrence of detectable viral transients to become rarer with increased time on treatment , something which is not observed ( di mascio et al . , 2003a ) .",
    "furthermore , chronically infected patients are usually on therapy and their viral loads are generally suppressed below , or close to , the level of detection by standard assay . for these reasons we focused our analysis on hiv models that allow robust low steady state viral loads ( callaway and perelson , 2002 ) .",
    "+ _ simulation results _ + starting from a very simple model of t cell and hiv dynamics under drug therapy ( equations [ eqs1 ] ) , which when challenged with a growing pathogen only produced a gradual increase in viral load rather than a blip ( figure 1c ) we built a family of new models , at each step adding more biological realism and complexity .",
    "the results from each successive interim model guided us towards the creation of biologically realistic and robust end - models , which are capable of producing viral transients of  typical \" duration and amplitude , under a biologically reasonable parameter regime .",
    "addition of a proliferating effector pool and density dependent infected cell death to the initial model results in a model which can produce viral transients , but with an inherent trade - off between blip duration and amplitude ( equations [ eqs3 ] ) .",
    "the model either produces a blip of appropriate duration , but of amplitude several orders of magnitude larger than desired , or of appropriate amplitude , and upwards of 100 days duration ( figure [ figure 3 ] ) depending on the choice of parameters .",
    "this appears to be due to the fact that in the model the entire pool of cd4 + cells is activated by antigen , resulting in a large spike in viral replication .",
    "in addition , this large target pool has the low mortality assumed for `` resting '' cells , which affects the duration of the resulting blips .",
    "we then separate the target pool into antigen specific and non - specific cd4 + t cells , and allow activation by antigen - and thus increased susceptibility to infection - of the antigen - specific pool ( equations [ eqs6 ] ) .",
    "simulations of this model can produce blips with a sharp rise - time and slow decay , consistent with observation , and of  typical \" amplitude as described above .",
    "however , even the smaller ( @xmath169 rna copies / ml ) blips are slightly too long in duration ( @xmath170 days ) ( figure [ figure 4]a ) , and the model is very sensitive to changes in the activation parameter @xmath19 and the half - saturation constant @xmath61 , both of which are difficult to quantify via experiment or observation .    allowing the antigen - specific target cell pool to proliferate upon exposure to antigen is a natural next step , which eliminates the biologically ambiguous activation parameter , @xmath19 , and produces a model which generates `` blips '' of reasonable amplitude and duration over a range of parameter values ( equations [ eqs8 ] ; figure [ figure 7 ] )    a model that includes cell populations with different drug susceptibilities ( equations [ eqs9 ] ) generates robust low steady state viral loads without having to invoke density  dependent cell death and its attendant parameters ( cf .",
    "callaway and perelson , 2002 ) .",
    "this model when coupled with a cd8 + t cell model of the response to a replicating antigen , can also produce viral transients of appropriate amplitude and duration . in this case",
    "it is interesting to note that the viral transient arises entirely from the second compartment with reduced drug penetration ; thus the size and duration of such transients might scale with the size of the compartment from which they arise .",
    "_ limitations _ + the models presented here , despite their increasing complexity , remain simplifications of an in vivo system . in order to limit the size of our models and the number of parameters therein , we have not included hiv - specific cd8 + and cd4 + t cells .",
    "in addition , we have focused entirely on a t - cell mediated immunity , and have not included antibody ( b - cell ) responses .",
    "the clonal expansion and survival of cd8 + t cells may depend on the activity and  help \" of cd4 + t cells , but mostly during formation of memory and during antigen rechallenge ( bevan , 2004 ) .",
    "thus _ primary _",
    "cd8 + t cell responses are undiminished in a cd4 + t cell deficient system : when antigen alone invokes an overwhelming inflammatory response , as in many infections , primary cd8 + t cell responses are entirely independent of the cd4 + t cell response ( bevan , 2004 ) .",
    "yet cd8 + t cell memory during antigen _ rechallenge _ does not function properly in a cd4 + t cell deficient system .",
    "furthermore , there is some evidence that frequency of viral transients is statistically correlated with low cd4 + counts ( di mascio et al . , 2003a ) .",
    "it would be worth exploring whether , in a cd4 + t cell deficient environment , insufficient cd8 + t cell responses to chronic immune rechallenge contribute to episodes of transient viremia . while we do not include cd4 +  help \" , or indeed , cd8 + t cell memory in our system",
    ", these features would be necessary for any biologically realistic simulation of an immune system encountering pathogens in a stochastic fashion .",
    "we have omitted these features here as we have not modeled antigen rechallenge and immune memory .",
    "our future research interests include stochastic exploration of immune activation during random encounters ( and re - encounters ) with pathogen , and thus will invoke immune memory .    _ conclusions _",
    "+ we have shown that episodes of transient viremia in otherwise well  suppressed , chronically infected hiv patients under drug therapy may be triggered by randomly occurring opportunistic infections , which cause a rise in activated target cells , and thus transient bursts of infection and resultant viremia .",
    "simple models for coinfection , which incorporate stylized , predator - prey type immune dynamics , can not account for the occurrence of viral transients . however , if biologically realistic t cell dynamics that include programmed proliferation and contraction of the cd8 + t cell are incorporated into the model , along with a mechanism for producing robust low steady - state viral loads under haart , then we have shown that opportunistic infection can serve as a `` forcing function '' for transient episodes of viral replication and can explain the observation of viral blips in otherwise well - suppressed hiv patients .",
    "this is just one plausible mechanism among many for the generation of blips ; the list of possible causes also includes missed drug doses , activation of latently infected cells and release of virus from tissue reservoirs .",
    "it remains to be shown that these other mechanisms also work in a model and produce transients of appropriate amplitude and duration .",

    "<S> when highly active antiretroviral therapy is administered for long periods of time to hiv-1 infected patients , most patients achieve viral loads that are `` undetectable '' by standard assay ( i.e. , hiv-1 rna @xmath0 copies / ml ) . yet despite exhibiting sustained viral loads below the level of detection , a number of these patients experience unexplained episodes of transient viremia or viral  blips \" . </S>",
    "<S> we propose here that transient activation of the immune system by opportunistic infection may explain these episodes of viremia . indeed , immune activation by opportunistic infection may spur hiv replication , replenish viral reservoirs and contribute to accelerated disease progression . in order to investigate the effects of concurrent infection on chronically infected hiv patients under treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy ( haart ) , we extend a simple dynamic model of the effects of vaccination on hiv infection [ jones and perelson , jaids 31:369 - 377 , 2002 ] to include growing pathogens . </S>",
    "<S> we then propose a more realistic model for immune cell expansion in the presence of pathogen , and include this in a set of competing models that allow low baseline viral loads in the presence of drug treatment . programmed </S>",
    "<S> expansion of immune cells upon exposure to antigen is a feature not previously included in hiv models , and one that is especially important to consider when simulating an immune response to opportunistic infection . using these models </S>",
    "<S> we show that viral blips with realistic duration and amplitude can be generated by concurrent infections in haart treated patients . </S>"
