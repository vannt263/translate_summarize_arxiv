    "entanglement properties of interacting quantum many - body systems @xcite lies at the heart of many quantum information processes such as measurement based quantum computation , teleportation , security of quantum key distribution protocols , super - dense coding , etc .",

    "the calculation of the entanglement involves the knowledge of the _ reduced density matrix _ ( rdm ) characterizing quantum systems in contact with the environment such as a thermal bath or a larger system of which the original system is a subsystem . in particular",
    ", the spectrum of the rdm , which by definition is real and nonnegative with all eigenvalues summing up to one , provides an intrinsic characterization of a subsystem .",
    "the relative importance of a subsystem state , indeed , is directly related to the weight that the corresponding eigenvalue has in the rdm spectrum .",
    "thus , for instance , the fact that the eigenvalues @xmath4 of the rdm for a one dimensional quantum interacting subsystems decay exponentially with @xmath5 implies that the properties of the subsystems are determined by only a few states .",
    "this property is crucial for the success of the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method @xcite in one dimension . in two dimensions this property",

    "the rdm is of rank @xmath7 so that for large @xmath6 the calculation of the spectrum becomes a problem of exponential difficulty . while the spectrum of the full rdm for subsystems with a small number of sites ( e.g. @xmath8 ) has been calculated @xcite , the full rdm for arbitrary @xmath6 is , to our knowledge ,",
    "exactly known only for the very special case of non interacting quantum systems such as free fermions ( see e.g. @xcite ) or free bosons .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to analytically calculate the elements of the rdm of permutational invariant quantum systems of arbitrary size @xmath9 , for arbitrary permutational symmetry of the state of the system ( labelled by an integer number @xmath10 ) and arbitrary sizes @xmath6 ( number of q - bits ) of the subsystem .",

[",
    "sec : properties of the rdm ]",
    "the rdm can be calculated in the natural basis by using its definition in terms of observables : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a physical operator acting on the hilbert space of the @xmath75 subsystem .",
    "the knowledge of the full set of observables determines the rdm uniquely .",
    "indeed , if we introduce the natural basis in the hilbert space of the subsystem , @xmath76 , the elements of the rdm in this basis are @xmath77 with @xmath78 and @xmath79 a @xmath80 matrix with elements @xmath81 .",

    "note that a generic property of the rdm elements , which follows directly from ( [ prho - rhop ] ) , is that any permutation between pairs of indices @xmath88 and @xmath89 does not change its value , e.g. @xmath90 another property of the rdm follows from the @xmath2 invariance @xmath91 thus , for instance , the rdm for @xmath92 has only @xmath93 nonzero ( @xmath94 different )  elements , @xmath95 @xmath96 and @xmath97 , subject to normalization @xmath98 @xmath99 .",

    "note that the latter operator conserves the total spin polarization since the number of lowering and rising operators is the same .",
    "also note that the correlation functions with a non conserved polarization vanish , e.g. @xmath113 in accordance with ( [ rdm_elements_icerule ] ) .",
    "one can take advantage of the @xmath2 invariance ( e.g. eq . [ rdm_elements_icerule ] ) to block diagonalize the rdm into independent blocks @xmath114 of fixed polarization @xmath115 ( here @xmath116 gives the number of spin up present in the subsystem ) . in fig .",

    "we also remark that the fact that the middle block @xmath124 in fig .",

    "one can check that these matrices satisfy all properties of matrix @xmath148 given above and in particular , the number of their nonzero eigenvalues ( all equal to @xmath158 ) coincides with the dimension @xmath157 of the yt to which they are associated .",
