    "sno has provided an evidence for neutrino flavor transformation with cc / nc measurement @xcite .",
    "missing piece from the experimental side is a realtime spectrum measurement at energies below 5 mev . individually measured fluxes of pp",
    ", @xmath2be and pep neutrinos will be the key to complete the verification of the standard solar model ( ssm ) .",
    "a measurement of cno cycle neutrinos would be a realization of davis initial dream and it will contribute to construct the stellar evolution model . along these motivations , there are two forthcoming experiments ; kamland solar phase @xcite and borexino @xcite .",
    "they will start by observing @xmath2be neutrinos which have high signal rate and the characteristic spectrum edge .",
    "also , pep / cno neutrinos are seen within their scopes but they require special treatment on @xmath6c spallation background .",
    "this background is more serious for kamland which is placed in shallower site but tagging the associated neutrons ( @xmath795% br ) will drastically improve the situation .",
    "a new electronics designed for maximizing the rejection efficiency is being developed .",
    "proposed sno@xmath8 with liquid scintillator will have much better sensitivity to these neutrinos thanks to its size and depth .",
    "the realtime measurement of pp neutrino is very challenging .",
    "it requires very powerful background rejection method / apparatus such as delayed coincidence or non - carbonic ultra pure detector .",
    "lens @xcite revived an idea of indium loaded liquid scintillator ( 3 fold delayed coincidence ) with sophisticated fine segmentation techniques .        in the context of flavor - dependent reconstruction of supernova neutrino",
    "fluxes the answer to the above question is clearly _",
    "no_. a sn at 10 kpc is believed to produce events in sk and kamland as tabulated in table  [ eventssk - kl ] .",
    "the numbers are given only for the normal hierarchy , but it is very much dependent of the hierarchy @xcite .",
    "even if we assume that the mass hierarchy is determined by other means , reconstruction of luminosity and spectra of three effective species of sn neutrinos , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , does not appear to be possible with the observation by sk and kamland only .",
    "the most difficult part is to obtain spectral information of @xmath12 because nc measurement is essentially `` counting the number '' experiment .",
    "an organized efforts are called for to define a well - thought strategy for future sn neutrino observation with practical set up of experimental arrays .      the relic sn neutrinos",
    ", the ones integrated over the past history of universe , will give us a mean for direct probe of the type ii supernova rate .",
    "then , it can be translated into the constraint on the star formation rate in the universe which has a large uncertainty at the moment . for recent discussion , see e.g. , @xcite and an extensive references in @xcite . figure  [ sfr ]",
    "summarizes the situation .",
    "since the prediction by various models is either above or close to the limit placed by sk @xcite , there is an exciting possibility that it will be detected soon .",
    "otherwise , we would need either gd loading of sk iii which is the subject of the next subsection , or a megaton class detector .",
    "see @xcite for these points .",
    "three recent results for the star formation rate are also shown with long - dashed red line ( dahlen et al . ) , solid black line ( galex ) , and short - dashed blue line ( cole et al . ) .",
    "the blue up - going arrow indicates the size of dust correction . for more details ,",
    "see @xcite . ]      a proposal of gd - loaded sk ( `` gadzooks '' ) that has been put forward by beacom and vagins @xcite is an extremely interesting option .",
    "if realized it will allow us to tag neutrons at @xmath1390% efficiency which tremendously enhances detectability of sn relic neutrinos as well as adding new power to flavor dependent reconstruction of @xmath4 fluxes .",
    "the real problem for this proposal is the experimental issues , such as whether one can guarantee that water transparency and radio purity can be maintained , and no damage is given to the water tank etc .",
    ", as addressed in the talk in this workshop @xcite .",
    "as it stands , neutrino physics around mev energies is a very exciting active field .",
    "we must mention that while we tried to cover all the topics covered in the session but failed to discuss them in sufficient depth .",
    "nonetheless , we hope that this manuscript succeeds to convey the exciting atmosphere felt by people in the community .",

    "<S> we present a brief informative overview of a broad ranges of subjects , the solar , the reactor , the geo and the supernova neutrinos ( but without excluding possible biases ) , the topics which consist of the session `` neutrino physics around mev energies '' in now2006 . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to the naive expectation , the field is found to be very active in improving the performance of existing detectors , and in preparation for the development coming in the near future . </S>",
    "<S> the former includes excellent performance of sno @xmath0he detector , successful reconstruction of sk iii , and kamland s new `` 4@xmath1 '' calibration . </S>",
    "<S> the next data release from these experiments will be very exciting . </S>",
    "<S> the latter includes effort for lowering threshold in sk iii , kamland s purification by which geo - neutrino observation becomes much cleaner , and the forthcoming @xmath2be neutrino measurement by borexino and kamland . </S>",
    "<S> possible detection of relic supernova neutrinos and non - zero effect of @xmath3 would bring us great excitement . furthermore , improved new measurement of heavy element abundance in the solar atmosphere resulted in a solar model with much lower cno @xmath4 flux and with disagreement with helioseismology , thereby bringing us a new solar puzzle . </S>"
