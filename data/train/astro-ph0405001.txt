    "galaxy formation is now at the fore - front of cosmology , as many major cosmological questions and parameters appear to be known with some certainty ( spergel et al .",
    "there is luckily progress on this front . the nearby bright galaxy population , defined as galaxies brighter than m@xmath12 , are becoming fairly well characterized with recent surveys such as 2df and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ( e.g. , kauffmann et al .",
    "2003 ; bell et al . 2003 ) , and will become even more so after the sdss is completed . thus far ,",
    "sloan and others has argued that @xmath13% of the luminosity in the nearby universe originates from early - type galaxies , with an even higher fraction of contemporary stellar mass in these evolved systems ( e.g. , fukugita , hogan & peebles 1998 ; blanton et al . 2001 ; hogg et al .",

    "the nearby bright galaxy population is also clearly bimodal with a large population of old massive systems , and a large population of less massive galaxies with younger stellar populations ( kauffmann et al .",

    "the morphological distributions of nearby galaxies is however , not as well studied .",
    "an analysis of the largest morphological catalog of galaxies , the `` third reference catalogue of bright galaxies '' ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) , show that approximately 75% of all galaxies with m@xmath12 are spirals , while about 23% are ellipticals and the remainder are irregular galaxies ( see also marzke et al .",

    "if these results are not biased by missing a substantial population of massive galaxies , or by cosmic variance , then galaxy formation is a gradual process that occurs over the age of the universe .",
    "it appears that we are coming to an agreement concerning when galaxies in our universe formed and the next step is determining how this formation occurred .",
    "there are at least three main methods for how galaxies can form : major mergers ( with mass ratios of 3:1 or lower ) , minor mergers ( with mass ratios of 3:1 or higher ) , and gas accretion from the intergalactic medium . understanding which of these processes is occurring requires examining the internal features of galaxies either through high resolution imaging or integral field spectroscopy .",

    "one basic result is that at @xmath11 the co - moving densities , co - moving b - band luminosities and co - moving stellar mass densities are nearly equal for peculiars , disks , and ellipticals .",

    "figure  1 shows this comparison for galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the hdf - s field .",
    "the scatter between the photometric redshift and the spectroscopic redshifts is @xmath4 = 0.08 with an average offset of 0.06 and an average ( @xmath31 .",
    "this is a fairly good accuracy , and suggests that the other photo - zs are likely reliable , on average , within this uncertainty .",
    "however as photo - zs are less accurate at fainter magnitudes , they are likely less reliable for less luminous and/or more distant galaxies .",
    "we compute rest - frame properties of these galaxies , including their absolute blue magnitudes ( m@xmath32 , rest - frame colors , and sizes ) using these redshifts ( see also dickinson et al . 2003 ) .      throughout this paper",

    "based on these images a classification was made .",
    "each galaxy was put into one of six categories : star , elliptical , early - type disk , late - type disk , edge - on disk , irregular , merger / peculiar , and unknown / too - faint .",
    "these classifications are very simple and are only based on appearance .",
    "no other information , such as colors or redshifts were used when determining types .",
    "we discuss in  3.1 biases due to redshift effects and morphological k - corrections .",
    "ellipticals , early - type disks and late - type disks were classified based on the presence of apparent bulge and disk components through the following criteria :    1 .",
    "* ellipticals : * if a galaxy appeared to be centrally concentrated with no evidence for a flatter , lower surface brightness , outer structure it was classified as an elliptical .",
    "* early - type disks : * if a galaxy contained a central concentration with some evidence for lower surface brightness outer light , it was classified as an early - type disk .",
    "* late - type disks : * late - type disks are galaxies that appear to have more outer low surface brightness light than inner concentrated light .",
    "* irregulars : * irregulars are galaxies that appear to have no central light concentration and a diffuse structure , sometimes with clumpy material present . 5 .",
    "* peculiars : * peculiars are systems that appear to be disturbed or peculiar looking .",
    "these galaxies are possibly in some phase of a merger ( conselice et al .",
    "2003 ) and are common at high redshifts .",
    "if a galaxy was too faint for any reliable classification it was placed in the * unknown / too - faint * category .",
    "often these galaxies appear as smudges without any structure .",
    "these could be disks or ellipticals , but their extreme faintness precludes a reliable classification .",
    "often , a system appeared very faint , but large scale peculiarities , such as warping and non symmetrical structure could be detected by eye .",
    "if any of these systems displayed this peculiarity it was placed into the peculiar category .",
    "the usefulness of this type of morphological classification is questionable ( e.g. , conselice 2003 ) since hubble types , and other eye - based classifications , are subjective . there is also the issue that fainter galaxies will be more difficult to classify , although classifications in the hdfs are on average possible to i = 27 ( conselice et al .",
    "this is fainter than the limit used in abraham et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , whose use a i = 25 limit .",
    "our analyses are based on definitive classifications of broad types , with a generous unclassifiable option , and these should not be affected significantly by morphological classification biases .",
    "it is clear from the data that to i = 27 classifications can be performed for the majority of galaxies . between i = 26 and",
    "i = 27 , 38% of systems are unclassifiable , this rises to 61% between i = 27 and i = 28 .",
    "we thus use the limit i = 27 for obtaining a morphological classification for the majority of galaxies in the hdfs . to test the reliability of this classification , we do a series of simulations of nearby galaxies (  2.6.1 ) and hdf - n galaxies between @xmath34 placing them at higher redshifts .",
    "when we reclassify these galaxies after simulation we find that most ( @xmath8 70% ) with magnitudes @xmath35 are still classifiable by eye into their original types , justifying our use of this magnitude limit .",
    "note that at @xmath36 , quantitative classifications are also possible , but require corrections due to surface brightness dimming ( conselice et al .",
    "2000a ;  2.6.1 ) .",
    "we also repeat this eye - ball classification for the hdf - n using the nir h@xmath26 band images to test for effects of morphological k - corrections (  2.6 ) and to obtain a rest - frame b - band classification for the hdf - n sample .      to quantify the structural features of galaxies in the hdfs",
    ", we use the concentration , asymmetry and clumpiness ( cas ) system described in detail in conselice ( 2003 ) . in the cas system the concentration index ( @xmath37 ) is a measure of how centrally concentrated or compact a galaxy is ( bershady et al .",
    "2000 ) . based on empirical correlations",
    "the concentration index is a measure of the form , and scale of a galaxy ( i.e. , its mass ) .",
    "concentrations correlate fairly well with the absolute magnitude of a galaxy and its bulge to disk ratio ( conselice 2003 ) . the asymmetry index ( @xmath38 ) , first measured by schade et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , abraham et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and conselice ( 1997 ) is a measure of the global distortion in a galaxy from a completely symmetric structure , and is a good method for indicating galaxies undergoing major mergers ( conselice et al .",
    "2000a , 2000b ; conselice et al .",
    "2003 ) . the clumpiness index , @xmath39 , correlates with the amount of star formation in a galaxy , as shown by its fairly strong correlation with h@xmath40 fluxes and broad - band colors ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "there are many issues concerning how these parameters are measured , which are discussed at length in conselice et al .",
    "( 2000a ) , bershady et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and conselice ( 2003 ) .",
    "since the cas system is model independent and works in batch mode , the catalogs for the various hdfs were fed into an iraf based program that computes cas parameters and petrosian radii for each galaxy ( see conselice 2003 ) . before we ran any of the cas programs , we performed several pre - analysis quality control steps .",
    "the most important of these was to minimize as much as possible contamination from neighboring galaxies .",
    "this was done was by creating sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) segmentation maps that reveal unambiguously pixels belonging to each galaxy .",
    "these maps are created during the sextractor detection process .",
    "the form of the segmentation map is such that every pixel is valued either zero or has a integer value , corresponding to a catalog entry , that reveals which galaxy that pixel belongs .",
    "based on these maps , we isolated each galaxy s segmentation area and placed all light from other galaxies to the background level and noise before computing the cas parameters .",
    "systems which are merging may be artificially separated by this process into two separate galaxies .",
    "this is largely not a problem however as galaxies which are undergoing mergers are asymmetric with , or without , the presence of the other galaxy .",
    "the only concern about these galaxies is that they might be double counted when considering the number of mergers ( see conselice et al .",
    "we are also not biasing asymmetry measurements by replacing the light from nearby galaxies with the background , and therefore potentially not retrieving the underlying light from the galaxy being measured .",
    "the reason for this is that the asymmetry computation is heavily weighted towards the brightest parts of a galaxy , and any faint outer light contributes very little to the measurement ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "there are many other technical issues that are involved in applying an automated and quantitative approach such as measuring cas parameters .",
    "these issues include correcting for noise and defining the radius and center by which these parameters are measured .",
    "the noise in the hdf - n and hdf - s wfpc2/nicmos images is enhanced near the edges of the frames , and thus we remove these systems from our analyses . to deal with noise in a general sense we follow the procedure outlined in conselice et al .",
    "( 2000a , 2003 ) for understanding and accounting for systematics presented by the background .",
    "we further follow the techniques in these papers when accounting for radii and centering routines when computing the cas parameters .",
    "we give only a brief description of these procedures here and refer the reader to previous papers for detailed explanations for how cas parameters are computed .",
    "one critical component to understanding and correct for when measuring cas parameters is the presence of background noise .",
    "this noise originates from read noise , photon counts from background light , and any intrinsic variations of this background within a small sky area .",
    "our background correction method as outlined in conselice et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , will correct for both correlated and uncorrelated noise , assuming that in either case it is also present where the galaxy itself is found . as noted in conselice et al .",
    "( 2003 ) there are several problems to this methodology , most importantly the fact that the sky varies across these images , particularly in the nicmos bands ( conselice et al .",
    "we obtain a partial solution to this problem by computing the cas parameters using several background areas across each wfpc2 and nicmos image .",
    "this gives us an understanding of how the background light contributes to errors in our measurements , as each cas run gives us a slightly different set of parameters depending on the background area chosen .",
    "after measuring cas values using these different backgrounds we find that the statistical variation in the computation of these parameters across images is smaller than the measurement errors .",
    "this effect therefore does not contribute significantly to the error budget of our cas measurements .",
    "we use in this paper the 1.5 @xmath28 r@xmath41 inverted petrosian radius described and calibrated in detail in bershady et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , conselice et al . (",
    "2000a ) and conselice ( 2003 ) to measure cas parameters .",
    "briefly , the inverted petrosian radius is the radius where the surface brightness in an annulus at that radius is a given fraction of the surface brightness within the radius .",
    "our use of @xmath42 to define the radius of our galaxies is the same as that used by the sloan digital sky survey to measure magnitudes ( e.g. , blanton et al . 2001 ) .",
    "based on simulations , it can be shown that for most popular galaxy light profiles , such as exponential , gaussian , and de vaucouleur , the petrosian radius , defined this way , contains @xmath43% of the light from these systems .",
    "the cas program also measures the half - light radii of these galaxies , within the 1.5 @xmath28 r@xmath41 radius .      using the wavelength coverage of the wfpc2 bands , we are able to determine the rest - frame b - band morphologies of our sample in both the hdf - n and hdf - s out to @xmath44",
    ". we can further compute rest - frame b - band cas parameters out to @xmath45 using the nicmos hdf - n imaging .",
    "we compute rest - frame b - band cas parameters and radii by linearly interpolating between the values measured in the observed hst wavebands , that straddle the observed wavelength of the b - band , at a given redshift . for galaxies at @xmath46 , in the hdf - n , we use the observed h@xmath26 band morphologies and radii .",
    "the stellar masses we use are from the analyses of papovich et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , papovich ( 2002 ) and dickinson et al .",

    "to determine the stellar masses of the galaxies in both the north and the south their seds were fit by various star formation histories with different metallicities and internal extinction values derived from bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) stellar population synthesis models .",

    "it is important to understand what effects redshift will have on the quantitative values of our galaxy classifications , including the cas parameters , particularly if redshift creates a systematic effect of either lowering or rising the threshold for placing an object into one of the hubble sequence bins .",
    "this effect has already been explored by conselice et al .",
    "( 2000a ) , conselice ( 2003 ) and conselice et al .",
    "( 2003 ) although we re - examine this in more detail here in a empirical way here and in  3.1.1 .",
    "there are two major effects produced by redshift - the dimming of galaxies and the morphological k - correction .    to determine how various normal galaxy morphologies change solely due to redshift effects , that is surface brightness dimming , we simulate rest - frame optical images of nearby hubble types from the frei et al .

    "1996 ) digital catalog of galaxies ( see also conselice 2003 ) by placing them at higher redshifts . by doing this",
    "we are able to determine how the morphological properties of galaxies change solely due to redshift .",
    "we analyze these simulations by performing the exact same cas runs on these simulated galaxies as we did on the galaxies in the hdfs themselves .",
    "thus , by comparing the cas parameters for the @xmath14 sample to how their values change at @xmath2 , we can determine the effects of redshift on the measurement of cas parameters , which we can compare to the observed evolution to determine the true change in cas values from low to high redshift .",
    "we find that the most significant changes occur at redshifts @xmath5 , particularly for the most asymmetric and clumpy galaxies .",

    "2002 ; papovich et al .",
    "generally , galaxies appear as later types when viewed at bluer wavelengths , as star formation is more visible and older stellar populations are fainter at shorter wavelengths .",

    "the line through the middle overlaps those systems which have the same classification in both bands .",
    "figure  2 demonstrates that there are some morphological biases between the two bands .",
    "the most common disagreement is that there are more systems classified as too faint in the h - band than in the i - band .",
    "this results from these systems , which are most commonly ellipticals and peculiars , being too faint in the h@xmath26 band due to the shorter exposure time used to obtain the nicmos imaging ( dickinson et al .",
    "2000 ) . otherwise , the most common misclassifications are what we would expect .",
    "for example , there are 13 systems classified as an early type spiral ( es ) in the i@xmath24 band which are classified as elliptical in the h@xmath26 , and there are nine systems classified as a late type spiral ( ls ) in i@xmath24 which are classified as early - type spirals in h@xmath26 .",
    "most of these systems are at low redshift , where disks and ellipticals are found in abundance .",
    "we are thus not likely biased by using the i@xmath24 band in determining classifications , particularly peculiars , which remain peculiar at all wavelengths .",
    "there are many selection effects which we discuss throughout this paper .",
    "the most obvious is that we use a i@xmath24 @xmath1 magnitude selection for galaxies in our analysis .",

    "as can be seen , the peak in the distribution is at @xmath7 , with a smaller peak at higher redshifts around @xmath50 .    to determine how faint we can go in our analysis without missing objects , we investigate how absolute magnitudes vary with redshift ( figure  4 ) . at redshifts",

    "the i@xmath49 limit is likely incomplete and we can not be confident that we are not missing some fraction of the galaxy population . unless otherwise stated , we use the i@xmath49 limit in our analysis .",
    "the fact that we are not missing galaxies at @xmath51 can also be seen in another way by examining figure  5 which plots the apparent magnitudes of all hdf - s and hdf - n galaxies , as a function of redshift , out to @xmath0 with the i@xmath49 limit imposed .",
    "the solid , short dashed and long dashed lines are the expected apparent magnitude of m@xmath52 ellipticals , sa and sc galaxies , respectively , as a function of redshift .",
    "the value m@xmath52 is roughly the value of l@xmath54 for modern galaxies .",

    "the first cut at a basic morphological analysis involves examining how our eye - ball estimates of galaxy types are distributed with redshift . examining the raw numbers of ellipticals and spirals as a function of type reveals a deficit of ellipticals and spirals at redshifts larger than @xmath11 ( figures 6 & 7 ) .",

    "the computed co - moving densities for the i@xmath1 sample are listed in table  2 .",
    "note that this drop is seen in both the hdf - s and hdf - n , thus it is unlikely to be purely the result of cosmic variance .",
    "the drop - off in number becomes more pronounced when we consider only those systems that are brighter than m@xmath63 .",
    "note that this change is gradual , and does not occur instantaneously , but is most rapid between @xmath64 .",

    "this figures remains largely identical when using the m@xmath52 limit .",
    "the most notable trend in figure  7 is the gradual increase in the fraction of galaxies with peculiar morphologies at higher redshifts , with a corresponding decrease in the fraction of ellipticals and spirals .",
    "there is also a general relative increase with redshift in the fraction of galaxies too faint for classification in all three images . from figures  6",
    "& 7 it also appears that there are galaxies that morphologically appear as disks and ellipticals at redshifts @xmath5 , although the numbers are small ( cf .",
    "conselice et al .",
    "finally , we note that at @xmath11 the relative number density of ellipticals , disks and peculiars is relatively similar .",
    "the decline in hubble types at @xmath5 has been noted before ( van den bergh et al .",
    "2001 ; kajisawa & yamada 2001 ) , but its suddenness deserves further attention and a careful analysis .",
    "one aspect of this that has not been examined is how much of the drop in normal galaxies is due to redshift effects . to answer this question",
    "we simulate galaxies that are at z@xmath65 in the hdf to how they would appear at @xmath11 .",
    "this simulation is done following the procedure outlined in conselice ( 2003 ) and conselice et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . in summary ,",
    "the procedure is to take the observed v@xmath23-band hdf - n image , which corresponds to rest - frame b - band for objects at @xmath66 , and reduce it in resolution and signal to noise to match how these @xmath66 galaxies would appear in nicmos images of the hubble deep field north if they were at @xmath11 .",
    "by doing this experiment we can determine what fraction of spirals and ellipticals are identifiable at this redshift .",

    "@xmath6 and @xmath68 in the hdf - n there are 130 galaxies brighter than m@xmath69 , of which 35 are classified as ellipticals and 44 as spirals .",
    "when we perform the @xmath11 simulation and reclassify all objects , we find that 28 of the ellipticals and 29 of the spirals are still identifiable as such .",
    "this gives us a detection fraction , f@xmath70 , of 0.8 for ellipticals and 0.66 for spirals .    to determine the significance of the drop in ellipticals and spirals at @xmath11 we first must determine the systematic effects of redshift on the detectability of these simulated galaxies .",
    "since the drop off in hubble types occurs at roughly @xmath7 , we take the average number , per co - moving gpc@xmath71 , of ellipticals and spirals at redshifts @xmath9 .",
    "we then multiply these densities by the detection fraction from our simulation to determine the number of spirals and ellipticals we would expect to find at @xmath11 , if no morphological , luminosity , or number density evolution were occurring . the numbers in our fiducial @xmath8 1131 mpc@xmath60 co - moving volume we expect to find at @xmath11 are @xmath72 ellipticals and @xmath73 spirals . since we find only three ellipticals and three spirals in this redshift range , there is clearly a significant difference between the number of hubble types expected and those found .",
    "the formal significance of this drop is 4.2 @xmath4 for the ellipticals and @xmath74 @xmath4 for spirals . as we have considered all redshift effects : morphological k - corrections , dimming and resolution , in this calculation we can conclude with confidence that the drop in hubble types seen at @xmath11 is likely real .",
    "the gradual increase of peculiar galaxies at the expense of normal hubble types is circumstantial evidence that at least some fraction of modern spirals and ellipticals originate from peculiar galaxies ( see conselice et al .",

    "there appears to be a relatively similar number of spirals and ellipticals at @xmath9 in both the hdf - n and hdf - s . at redshifts @xmath75 where the h@xmath26 data is sampling the rest - frame optical light from these galaxies",

    "future studies , such as the goods survey ( giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ) will better address the cosmic variance problem .",

    "we parameterize the luminosity function using the 1/v@xmath77 formalism ( schmidt 1968 ; felten 1976 ) :    @xmath78    where the summation is over each galaxy in a given magnitude ( m ) , morphological - type , and redshift ( z ) bin .",

    "note that we do not do luminosity functions corrections as we are interested in matching luminosities with our classifications .",
    "figures 8 & 9 show that the total b - band luminosity function does not appear to change drastically at different redshifts except at the bright end .",
    "the faint end of these luminosity functions also tend to match the 2df b - band luminosity function ( norberg et al .",

    "we do not integrate fitted luminosity functions to compute the integrate light , or extrapolate to fainter magnitudes based on a fitted luminosity function . doing this for the different morphological types would not effect the results in any substantial way .",
    "based on figures 9 & 10 it appears that the luminosity density is dominated at @xmath3 by galaxies in a peculiar phase . at @xmath9",
    "the luminosity density is dominated by normal galaxies , that is , spirals and ellipticals .",
    "there are a few other effects that can be determined from figure  10 .",
    "first , the b - band luminosity density of peculiars drops from @xmath0 to 0 and rapidly becomes a minor contributor to the luminosity density at lower redshifts in both the north and the south hdf .",
    "furthermore , the luminosity density of peculiars and normal galaxies is nearly equal at @xmath11 when normal galaxies begin to appear in the same number densities as at @xmath14 .",
    "the peak in the b - band luminosity density at @xmath7 is due to spirals and ellipticals - not the peculiars .",
    "in fact , at @xmath17 ellipticals and spirals dominate the b - band luminosity density of the universe . since b - band luminosity traces star formation as well as",
    "existing stellar mass , understanding the implications for this is not straightforward , but can be understood better by examining the growth of stellar mass in these systems (  3.3 ) .",
    "this b - band luminosity is however originating at @xmath17 from a combination of evolved stellar populations plus new star formation .",
    "this can further be seen by studying the u - band luminosity density of objects as a function of redshift .",
    "based on this , it appears that all galaxy types are contributing to the star formation density ( e.g. , de mello et al .",

    "there is a second peak at higher redshift @xmath45 , particularly in the hdf - s , which is dominated by emission from peculiar galaxies . in the hdf - s",
    "there are several very bright galaxies at @xmath3 that we identify by eye as ellipticals and peculiars",
    ". these systems also have large stellar masses (  3.3 ) , and their existence is one of the fundamental differences between the two hdfs .",
    "it must also be said that their existence , for the most part , relies on photometric redshifts that can differ between different groups .",
    "spectroscopic followup is necessary to confirm such a large different between the two hdf fields .",
    "the build up of a galaxy s stellar mass occurs when baryonic gas is converted into stars after cooling .",
    "when and how this star formation occurs is a fundamental question in cosmology with most approaches either tracing the star formation directly ( e.g. , madau et al . 1998 ) or through integrated effects traced by the stellar masses of galaxies ( dickinson et al .",
    "it appears that over half of all stellar mass in the universe was formed between @xmath7 and @xmath0 , a time interval of @xmath81 gyrs .",
    "the modes of star formation during this epoch are important for understanding how galaxies formed .",
    "using morphological information , including the cas parameters for these galaxies (  3.5 ) , we can possibly determine the modes by which star formation is occurring .    to determine in which galaxies stars formed we examine the distribution of stellar mass as a function of morphological type at redshifts from @xmath6 to @xmath0 .",
    "figure  11 shows the total mass functions of galaxies at our four redshift ranges .",
    "we compute these mass functions based on the same v@xmath77 formalism described in  3.2 .",

    "these stellar mass densities are tabulated in table  4 as a function of redshift .",
    "figure  11 and 13 demonstrate that the stellar mass density decreases as one goes to higher redshifts ( dickinson et al .",

    "; rudnick et al . 2003 ; drory et al . 2004 ) .",
    "figure  11 & 12 show that the decrease in stellar masses is not due to any one type of galaxy , but is the result of galaxies of all morphologies growing in mass at lower redshifts .",
    "some massive galaxies appear to have already formed between @xmath82 ( figure  12 ) in the hdf - n .",
    "disks and ellipticals in the hdf - n with stellar masses m@xmath83 have a co - moving stellar mass density similar to the total density of these objects at @xmath14 ( cole et al .",

    "2004 ; franx et al .",
    "2003 ) where some massive galaxies appear to be already formed by @xmath11 . while we do not see massive galaxies in the hdf - s around @xmath7 as we do in the hdf - n , we do find massive hdf - s systems at @xmath84 .",
    "this suggests that cosmic variance is indeed a real issue when trying to understand the evolution of galaxy properties using small hst fields .",
    "figures 12 & 13 allow us to determine the types of galaxies contributing to the stellar mass density at various redshifts .",
    "we do not extrapolate our stellar mass densities at the faint end to determine the total stellar mass density , as done in dickinson et al .",
    "we ignore the faint galaxies we do not detect as we are interested in the contribution of different morphological types to the mass density , and the morphological types of these fainter systems is unknown .",
    "the total mass density shown in figure  13 is therefore an underestimate of the total ( see dickinson et al .",
    "this correction is however relatively minor .    in our lowest redshift range , @xmath82 , the mass density",
    "is dominated by ellipticals and spirals .",
    "the fraction of mass in the peculiar phase is very small , only @xmath85% of the total in both the hdf - n and hdf - s .",
    "the peculiar systems in this redshift range also have low masses , nearly all with m@xmath86 . at higher redshifts ,",
    "@xmath87 there is a dramatic change , such that morphologically identified ellipticals and disks contribute a small fraction to the total stellar mass density while peculiars contribute the bulk of it . at the highest redshifts ,",
    "@xmath88 peculiar galaxies contribute @xmath89 60 - 80% of the stellar mass density in both fields . in figure  14",
    "we plot the redshift and morphological distribution of stellar masses out to @xmath15 .",
    "figures  12 and 14 demonstrate that at redshifts @xmath5 the most massive systems are generally peculiars , while at redshifts lower than @xmath11 the most massive systems are ellipticals .",
    "these trends can be further seen in figure  13 ; just as in the luminosity density , the stellar mass densities of spirals , ellipticals and peculiars are nearly equal at @xmath11 .",
    "one major conclusion from our analysis of the number , luminosity and stellar mass densities is that disks , ellipticals and peculiars have nearly equal co - moving number , luminosity , and stellar mass densities at @xmath11 , and diverge at higher and lower redshifts .",
    "this is a smooth transition and several factors indicate that peculiars at high redshift are possibly the ancestors of ellipticals and components of disks found at lower redshift .",
    "high redshift peculiars are already fairly massive , are undergoing star formation , and must exist in some form at @xmath14 and 1 .",
    "the reverse is also true - the ellipticals must have formed stars at @xmath5 since some have quite old stellar populations ( e.g. , stanford et al .",
    "2004 ; moustakas et al .",
    "we would thus likely see their progenitors at higher redshifts and these are likely the peculiar systems .      figure  14 plots both individual stellar masses , and mass to light ratios as a function of redshift for galaxies in the hdf - n and hdf - s .",
    "as already discussed , there is an increase in stellar masses both in the aggregate , but also in terms of individual systems , out to about @xmath7 .",
    "based on the right panel of figure  14 , which shows the stellar mass to light ratios of the same galaxies plotted in the left panel of figure  14 , we can draw some general conclusions .",
    "first , there are no galaxies with large m / l ratios until about @xmath50 .",
    "this shows that in the hdf - n , star formation is very common in all galaxies in our selection .",
    "in fact , at @xmath3 the vast majority of all galaxies have mass to light ratios consistent with undergoing a starbursts within the past 500 myrs or less .",
    "this may not be a general result as there are more evolved high redshift galaxies in the hubble deep field south ( franx et al .",
    "2003 ) and other fields ( daddi et al . 2004 ) . some of these objects can be seen on figure  14 as systems with high m / l ratios at @xmath3 .",
    "in general it appears that only by about @xmath11 do galaxies end starburst phases and begin to passively evolve .",
    "note also that figure  14a shows a selection effect such that only objects with m @xmath90 are visible at all redshifts regardless of their mass to light ratios .",
    "in addition to studying the apparent morphologies of galaxies in the two hubble deep fields we have measured their concentrations , asymmetries , and clumpiness ( cas ) indices , as well as a petrosian and half light radii , using the methodology outlined in conselice ( 2003 ) . these quantify the stellar light distributions in the rest - frame b - band for which we can determine a galaxy s form , shape , and size .    to understand how our eye - ball classifications fall within cas space , we plot in figure  15 concentration - asymmetry ( c - a ) diagrams for hdf - n and hdf - s galaxies in four different redshift cuts .",
    "figure  16 shows the corresponding asymmetry - clumpiness ( a - s ) diagrams .",
    "the lines in the c - a diagram denote the differences between early and late types ( bershady et al . 2000 ) as well as galaxies consistent with mergers ( conselice et al .",

    ", the agreement is good between the bershady et al .",
    "( 2000 ) classification of nearby galaxies in the c - a plane and the morphological classifications done by eye .",
    "there are a few disk galaxies in the early type regime , but these are dominated by large bulges .",
    "there is only one classified early - type found in the late - type area and the peculiars are located in the merger area .",
    "this also holds at intermediate redshifts , @xmath92 , where the early types and late - types are well separated and all but one of the galaxies with @xmath93 is morphologically classified as a peculiar .",
    "this however beings to break down in the @xmath94 range , where galaxies classified as early types are found in the late type area and the peculiars are found at nearly all a values , but typically are towards the higher a range .",
    "this is the case as well for systems at @xmath95 .",
    "this demonstrates that the structural features of galaxies , as well as their stellar populations can be inconsistent with the physical interpretation of morphological types established at @xmath14 ( e.g. , moustakas et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the a - s digram ( figure  16 ) is a perpendicular slice through cas space to the a - c plane ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "the s parameter correlates with star formation , while the a parameter is affected by both star formation and dynamical activity such as merging .",
    "the solid line in figure  16 shows the relationship between @xmath38 and @xmath39 found for nearby normal galaxies in conselice ( 2003 ) .",
    "the early type galaxies out to @xmath96 have low clumpiness and asymmetry values , as is found for ellipticals at @xmath14 ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "the disk galaxies at @xmath97 have larger s and a values , but still follow the trend ( solid line ) between s and a found for nearby normal systems .",
    "the dashed lines are the 3 @xmath4 scatter of normal nearby galaxies from this relationship at @xmath14 .",
    "it was shown in conselice ( 2003 ) that systems which deviate from this s - a relationship by more than 3 @xmath4 are consistent with undergoing major mergers .",
    "this is analogous to the color - asymmetry relationship and its outlier method of identifying major mergers ( conselice et al .",
    "2000a ; conselice et al . 2000b",
    "; conselice 2003 ; conselice et al .",
    "figure  16 shows that in every redshift bin , the galaxies that deviate from the nearby s - a relationship are the peculiars .",
    "there are a few non - peculiars that also deviate , but these on closer inspection are systems that have nearby companions and slight peculiarities , although many are still identifiable as spirals morphologically .      the cas diagrams ( figures 15 & 16 ) can be compared directly with normal galaxies using figure  12 from conselice ( 2003 ) . making this comparison , there appears to be several differences between the hdf and the conselice ( 2003 ) normal galaxy sample .",
    "one obvious difference is that there are few galaxies in the hdf - n or s that have high concentrations , which massive ellipticals tend to have ( bershady et al .",
    "2000 ; conselice 2003 ) .",
    "a large fraction of the hdf sample have concentration values that are consistent with being disk - like or dwarf like ( conselice et al .",
    "the nearby comparison sample however contains only nearby very bright and large early types .",
    "the galaxies in the hdf are perhaps more representative of the galaxy population than the bright selected samples used in conselice ( 2003 ) .",
    "we can argue that this is likely a real physical difference in the sense that ellipticals at higher redshifts in the hdfs likely have lower stellar and total masses than the most massive ellipticals in the nearby universe ( see  3.3 ) .",
    "we argue this through the correlation between the stellar masses of ellipticals derived by papovich ( 2002 ) and the concentration index .",
    "previously in conselice ( 2003 ) it was argued that the concentration index is a good representation of the scale of a galaxy in the sense that more massive galaxies have a higher degree of light concentration .",
    "there is in fact , a good correlation between stellar mass and concentration at @xmath7 .",
    "the best fit between these two parameters can be represented by ,    @xmath98    galaxies which are more concentrated are most massive , as argued also in graham et al .",
    "we can not yet say if this relationship evolves .",
    "this correlation , and the fact that there are not many bright m@xmath54 galaxies in the hdf , confirms our interpretation that there are ellipticals in the hdf at a range of masses and scales ( see also stanford et al .",
    "this also confirms that the relationship between scale and light concentrations ( graham et al .",
    "2001 ) holds out to at least @xmath11 for evolved stellar populations .",
    "ultimately , we are interested in connecting the high redshift population with lower redshift galaxies , most notably if high redshift peculiars evolve into lower redshift ellipticals and bulges . since high redshift peculiars are forming in massive starbursts ( e.g. , steidel et al .",
    "1999 ) , they could in principle evolve into massive galaxies .",
    "color - asymmetry diagrams ( figure  17 ) give us some idea for which types of galaxies are undergoing star formation and the triggering mechanisms .",
    "the solid and dashed lines show the @xmath14 relationship between ( b - v ) color and asymmetry as well as its 3 @xmath4 deviation .",
    "at all redshift ranges , the peculiars are the bluest and most asymmetric , on average .",
    "the only exception is in the @xmath99 redshift range where corrections to the asymmetry values are substantial ( table  1 ) .",
    "we argue from these figures that many galaxies undergoing star formation are asymmetric , and thus likely to be involved in major mergers ( conselice et al .",
    "that is , star formation appears to be merger induced in a significant fraction of peculiar galaxies ( mobasher et al .",
    "2004 ) .    what is the fate of these peculiar galaxies which appear to be involved in major mergers ?",
    "there are other clues that suggest they must become the hubble types at lower redshifts .",
    "the first is that the co - moving stellar mass density of peculiars declines with redshift ( figure  13 ; table  4 ) .",
    "although the mass density appears to remain constant at @xmath2 for the peculiars , these systems are undergoing massive star formation and thus should increase in stellar mass density over time unless they evolve morphologically into different types .",
    "the mass in peculiars must go somewhere , and given their stellar masses and the characteristics of their halos ( giavaliso et al .",
    "1998 ) they are likely in some form the progenitors of lower redshift normal galaxies .",
    "another clue is that these systems are merging and starbursting . by integrating the amount of stellar mass added to these galaxies over time through mergers and starbursts",
    ", their stellar masses could become as large as a modern m@xmath54 galaxy ( papovich et al .",
    "2001 ; conselice 2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "the most massive galaxies appear to be nearly formed by @xmath7 , consistent with the drop in major merger rates at @xmath17 ( conselice et al .",
    "it is also not likely that we are missing a population of dusty galaxies , as sub - mm sources are detectable in the optical , within our limits , and also have peculiar morphologies ( conselice , chapman & windhorst 2003 ; chapman et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "major mergers and the star formation it induces is therefore likely responsible for the luminosity density at @xmath3 and the build up of stellar mass to @xmath11 . as argued in conselice ( 2003 ) and conselice et al .",
    "( 2003a ) when using the rest - frame b - band light from a galaxy only major mergers produce a high asymmetry , these are thus unlikely to be systems undergoing minor mergers .",
    "star formation , even massive amounts , does not necessarily produce highly asymmetric galaxies either ( conselice et al .",
    "2000a ) . in any case ,",
    "only about 50 - 75% of all stellar mass is assembled by this redshift .",
    "there must be other methods whereby galaxies are forming stars at lower redshift .",
    "the methods must be such that they do not add significant mass to the most massive galaxies (  3.3 ) , nor can they significantly change the morphologies of these galaxies (  3.1 ) , thus major mergers are unlikely the cause .",
    "we can not determine with the present data what the cause of the increase in stellar mass at @xmath17 is produced by .",
    "minor mergers and accretion of intergalactic gas are the two major possibilities .",
    "recently , the minor merger history was traced using deep near infrared imaging out to @xmath7 by bundy et al .",
    "bundy et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found that the pair fractions of galaxies increases with redshift , but not as strongly as pair fractions detected in optical surveys .",
    "this implies that the mass to light ratios of the accreted galaxies are low and that they are undergoing star formation .",
    "bundy et al .",
    "( 2004 ) calculate that the amount of stellar mass in these satellites is roughly equal to the increase seen between @xmath7 to 0 .",
    "however , these masses are accounted for within the stellar mass density calculations ( dickinson et al .",
    "since these satellites appear to be undergoing interaction induced star formation this increase might be enough to account for the additional stellar mass accreted in galaxies at @xmath9 .",
    "star formation histories and rates for these satellites and their hosts will need to be measured to address this possibility .",
    "in this paper we present an analysis of rest - frame b - band luminosity , morphology , and stellar mass as a function of redshifts out to @xmath0 using the hubble deep field north and south .",
    "the aim of this study is to determine the evolution of galaxy structure and how it relates to the assembly of stellar mass in galaxies .",
    "our major conclusions are :    \\1 . through a visual analysis of the morphologies of galaxies in the hdf - n and hdf - s",
    "we conclude that there are only a few classifiable ellipticals or disks at redshift @xmath5 .",
    "this drop is abrupt and is robust to changes in s / n , resolution and morphological k - corrections at @xmath89 4 @xmath4 significance based on simulations .",
    "there also appears in the hdf - n and hdf - s a gradual decline in the co - moving density of spirals and ellipticals as a function of redshift .",
    "the decline in the number of ellipticals and disks at @xmath5 mirrors the rise in the number of peculiars at higher redshifts . at @xmath45",
    "approximately 60% at i @xmath1 of all galaxies are peculiars .",
    "a significant fraction of galaxies at higher redshift are unclassifiable , with @xmath8 50% at @xmath100 too faint for a reliable classification .",
    "we investigate the luminosity function of galaxies in the hdf - n and hdf - s and compute the luminosity density as a function of morphological type .",
    "we find , as others , that the luminosity density is dominated by disks and ellipticals at @xmath17 and by peculiar galaxies at @xmath5 .",
    "we find that at @xmath101 @xmath102% of the luminosity density in the hdf fields is in the form of disks and ellipticals , while at @xmath0 , 60 - 80% of the luminosity density originates from peculiar galaxies .",
    "the change in relative number and luminosity densities of peculiars and normal galaxies is mirrored in the evolution of stellar mass as a function of morphological type . at redshifts @xmath7 ,",
    "the most massive galaxies are ellipticals , with disks generally of lower mass , and peculiars having the lowest masses . at @xmath3 ,",
    "the most massive galaxies are peculiars , although all have stellar masses less than m@xmath54 . when examining the density of stellar mass as a function of morphology we find that at high redshift , @xmath3 , @xmath103% of stellar mass is in peculiars . at @xmath9 ,",
    "this fraction drops close to zero with a corresponding rise in the fraction and density of mass in ellipticals and disks .",
    "importantly , the total absolute stellar mass density of galaxies in a peculiar phase slightly declines , suggesting that peculiar galaxies have evolved into modern galaxies .",
    "we compare the stellar and star forming properties of galaxies in the hdf - n with their structural features using the cas morphological system .",
    "we find that out to @xmath0 eye - ball estimates of morphology agree well with the automated cas approach .",
    "that is , ellipticals out to redshifts @xmath44 are symmetric , concentrated and smooth , while disks are less concentrated and more asymmetric and clumpy , similar to what is found in the nearby universe ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "the peculiar galaxies are identifiable as mergers based in the cas systems , having large rest - frame b - band asymmetries ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "these asymmetric peculiars are also the bluest and are undergoing the most rapid unobscured star formation .    we conclude that that some massive galaxies originate from peculiars at high redshift .",
    "these peculiar galaxies , particularly the brighter ones , are undergoing major mergers ( conselice et al .",
    "major mergers are however not likely to produce all the stellar mass in galaxies at @xmath9 as a significant fraction of stellar mass forms after @xmath7 ( dickinson et al .",
    "2003 ) and there are few mergers during this time ( conselice et al .",
    "it is possible that this addition comes in the form of minor mergers ( bundy et al .",
    "future studies with the goods survey ( giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ) will reveal in more detail this evolution and its relationship to other physical properties .",
    "we thank mark dickinson for his many contributions to the hdf nicmos imaging and richard ellis for comments on this paper .",
