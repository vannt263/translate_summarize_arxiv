    "the theory of weak gravitational lensing ( `` cosmic shear '' ) of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by large - scale mass inhomogeneities has now been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "the distortions produce a unique non - gaussian signal in the cmb temperature and polarization patterns .",
    "the distinction with the primordial gaussian pattern can be exploited to determine various properties of the lensing sources . since inhomogeneities in the intervening mass field are expected to provide the dominant source of lensing , likelihood methods and quadratic estimators have been developed to map the projected mass distribution .",
    "such reconstruction will be important not only to study the matter power spectrum , but also to reconstruct the primordial polarization signal from inflationary gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "to linear order in the density - perturbation amplitude , lensing by mass fluctuations results in a deflection angle that can be written as the gradient of a projected gravitational potential ( i.e. , the deflection angle is a longitudinal vector field in the plane of the sky ) .",
    "algorithms to reconstruct the mass distribution hence measure only this longitudinal component of the deflection angle .",
    "a deflection angle that can be written as a curl  a gradient - free or transverse - vector field  can be produced through lensing by gravitational waves or through lensing by mass fluctuations to second order in the density - perturbation amplitude . since the curl - type deflection is expected to be significantly weaker than the gradient - type ( as discussed further below ) , measurement of the curl power spectrum has been used as a test of systematic artifacts in the cosmic - shear maps that have been produced with measurements of shape distortions to high - redshift galaxies @xcite . for galaxy cosmic - shear maps ,",
    "this curl component is measured by simply rotating each galaxy image by @xmath0 @xcite .    for cosmic - shear of the cmb , one can not simply rotate the temperature pattern at each point on the sky .",
    "however , there is indeed a method to reconstruct the curl component of the deflection angle that is directly analogous to that for reconstructing the gradient component @xcite . in this paper , we show that the cosmological curl signals are expected to be small , and that measurement of the cosmic - shear curl component can thus be used as a diagnostic for systematic artifacts , unsubtracted foregrounds , and/or primordial non - gaussianity .",

    "we introduce our formalism and present expressions for the weak - lensing corrections to the cmb power spectra from both gradient and curl modes of the deflection field . in section  [ sec4 ]",

    "the curl component , however , provides a useful method to establish the presence of such a noise bias which can be used to correct the gradient component or to allow for an accounting of the bias when cosmological parameters are measured .",
    "this follows from the fact that all signals of interest in the curl component are negligibly small such that the resulting reconstruction only leads to @xmath141 since @xmath142 , like @xmath138 can be predicted from the measured cmb power spectra , any excess noise in the reconstruction will suggest either systematics or the presence of an additional non - gaussian signal that is contributing via @xmath143 . even though the excess noises in the gradient and curl of the deflection field are different ",
    ", @xmath143 vs @xmath140the origin of the excess noise could very well be the same with the only differences resulting from variations in the two filters for the two modes .",
    "in general , any detection of excess noise in the curl component should suggest a bias in the gradient component .",
    "since filter shapes are known _ a priori _ , one should be able to establish some estimate on the expected excess noise in the gradient , given the excess noise in the curl .",
    "if this excess noise is significant , then the dominance of a systematic effect in the reconstruction is clearly established .",
    "currently , there is no mechanism to either estimate or establish the presence of a systematic noise component in the cmb lensing analysis .",
    "thus , we suggest that the curl component be used as a monitor of systematic effects and to understand if the @xmath139 reconstruction is affected through @xmath144 by non - gaussian secondary effects and foregrounds .    in general , we do not expect effects such as primordial non - gaussianity @xcite to be a significant concern for lensing reconstruction of the deflection - potential statistics .",
    "given the noise levels to the reconstruction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ recon ] , one can establish the minimum amplitude for which systematic effects or additional noise biases , as described by @xmath144 , can be detected via @xmath145 here @xmath146 , under the assumption of no signal in the curl component . using the estimated noise levels , from the eb combination of polarization maps to reconstruct the curl component , for example",
    ", one can establish systematic effects down to a level of 0.1% from the amplitude of the potential - fluctuation power spectrum . in the cosmic - shear simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite , noise biases at the level of 30% or more were found .",
    "we surmise that some of this may be due to conversion of kinetic - sz corrections to a deflection angle , although this probably does not account for all the excess noise .",
    "a study of the curl component may help clarify the nature of such noise biases in the simulation .",
    "lensing by gravitational waves is expected to give rise to a cosmic - shear pattern where the deflection angle has a curl ( or transverse - vector ) component , as opposed to the curl - free pattern expected by cosmic shear by density perturbations ( to linear order in the perturbation amplitude ) . to second order in the perturbation amplitude",
    ", lensing can also give rise to a curl component .",
    "for a primordial background of gravitational waves from inflation with a normalization given by the current upper limit to the tensor - to - scalar ratio , the corrections to the cmb power spectra are generally two orders of magnitude below those of the cosmic shear due to density perturbations , and the curl component from higher - order lensing effects is also small . the curl component can be reconstructed with quadratic estimators analogous to those developed to measure the gradient component . given the small signal expected in the curl",
    ", this component can potentially be used as a probe of systematic effects and foregrounds for next - generation cmb experiments      99 see , e.g. , u.  seljak and m.  zaldarriaga , phys .",
