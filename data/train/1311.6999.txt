    "the quantum hall effect is one of the most dramatic phenomena in condensed matter physics @xcite @xcite . at particular values of its charge density and magnetic field , a two - dimensional electron gas exhibits incompressible charge - gapped states .",
    "these states can be robust and persist over a range of the ratio of density to field , that is , over a hall plateau on which the hall conductivity is a constant @xmath0 times the elementary unit of conductivity @xmath1 ( @xmath2 in the natural units which we shall use in this paper ) , @xmath3 the same electron gas can exhibit an array of such states , where @xmath0 is generally an integer , for the integer quantum hall effect , or a rational number for the fractional quantum hall effect .",
    "what is more , the integer quantum hall effect has a beautiful and simple explanation as a single - particle phenomenon .",
    "when a charged particle moving in two dimensions is exposed to a magnetic field , its spectrum is resolved into discrete landau levels .",
    "landau levels are flat , dispersionless bands with gaps between them .",
    "fermi - dirac statistics dictates that the low energy states of a many - electron system are obtained by filling the lowest energy single - electron states , with one electron per state .",
    "when a landau level is completely filled with electrons , the next electron one inserts into the system must go to the next higher level which is separated from the ones that are already occupied by a gap .",
    "the result is a jump in the chemical potential . alternatively ,",
    "when the chemical potential is in the gap between levels , it can be varied with no change of the charge density .",
    "such a state is said to be incompressible .",
    "this effect is enhanced by disorder induced localization which forms a mobility gap and results in the hall plateau .    in the absence of disorder , for free electrons",
    ", the hall conductivity is given by ( [ hallconductivity ] ) with @xmath0 equal to the filling fraction . the filling fraction is defined as the ratio of the number of electrons to the number of states in the landau levels which are either completely or partially occupied ( see ( [ fillingfraction ] ) below ) . when a number of landau levels are completely filled , @xmath0 is an integer which coincides with the number of filled levels and the hall conductivity is quantized .",
    "it is given by the formula ( [ hallconductivity ] ) .",
    "moreover , for completely filled energy bands , the hall conductivity is a topological quantum number insensitive to smooth alterations of the energy band @xcite-@xcite , such as those caused by changes in the environment of the single electrons .",
    "we can turn on lattice effects and disorder with the hall conductivity remaining unchanged , and can thus conclude that , when @xmath0 is an integer , the quantized hall conductivity is robust for a large range of single - particle interactions including the effects of disorder which are responsible for forming the hall plateaus .",
    "in addition to this , there are good theoretical arguments for the persistence of the integer hall effect in the presence of electron - electron interactions , at least when the interactions are weak enough that perturbation theory can be applied . an easy way to understand this is by noting that , at the level of a low energy effective action , the hall effect is encoded in a chern - simons term for the photon field , @xmath4 the coefficient of the chern - simons term is proportional to the hall conductivity .",
    "moreover , there is a theorem which states that the chern - simons term does not renormalize beyond one - loop order in either a relativistic or non - relativistic field theory @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the theorem depends on the existence of a charge gap in the spectrum .",
    "if the gap closes it is known that either scalar or fermion charged matter can renormalize the chern - simons term @xcite .",
    "thus , as far as perturbation theory is valid , the existence of the integer quantum hall effect after interactions are turned on is intimately tied to the question of whether the incompressible nature of the state due to the energy gap between landau levels survives in the interacting theory .    in this paper , we shall discuss the question as to whether any features of the integer hall effect can persist when the coupling is strong , beyond the reach of perturbation theory .",
    "the development of ads / cft duality between certain gauge field theories and certain string theories has given us a tool for solving the strong coupling limit of some quantum systems .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite , two of the authors have found an example of a strongly coupled quantum field theory which , in a state with non - zero charge density and when subject to an external magnetic field , exhibits incompressible states with integer quantized hall conductivity .",
    "it occurs in a non - abelian gauge field theory that has a well - established string theory dual , the d3-d5 system @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the string theory is quantitatively tractable in its semi - classical low energy limit , and a further probe limit where the number of d5 branes is much smaller than the number of d3 branes .",
    "these limits coincide with the strong coupling and quenched planar limit of the quantum field theory and its solution yields information about the latter at strong coupling .",
    "the behavior of the theory when a charge density and magnetic field are added can readily be studied there . in that system , it was shown that there exist exotic states of the d3-d5 system where it becomes incompressible .",
    "these states occur at precisely integer values of the filling fraction @xmath0 , where @xmath5 with @xmath6 the particle density , @xmath7 the external field and @xmath8 the number of colors of quarks in the non - abelian gauge theory .",
    "these states were argued to be the natural strong coupling manifestation of some incompressible integer quantum hall states which appear in the weak coupling limit of that theory .    aside from a manifestation of an integer quantum hall state , the incompressible states of the strongly coupled system found in reference @xcite have an interesting analog in the observed quantum hall states of graphene .",
    "graphene is a two - dimensional semi - metal where the electron obeys an emergent massless dirac equation with four flavors of the fermion field and an effective su(4 ) symmetry @xcite",
    "this fact leads to the anomalous quantum hall effect @xcite where the hall conductance is quantized as @xmath9 the factor of 4 in this expression arises from the four - fold degeneracy of the low energy fermions and the offset of @xmath10 in @xmath11 is a result of the spectrum of the massless dirac fermions in a magnetic field .",
    "the dirac hamiltonian in a magnetic field has zero energy modes which form a landau level at the apex of the dirac cones .",
    "particle - hole symmetry dictates that , in the ground state of the many - electron system , when it is charge neutral , as well as all of the negative energy single electron states of the dirac hamiltonian , half of the zero modes should be filled .",
    "the neutral state is therefore not a hall plateau .",
    "it has a half - filled landau level and it is in the middle of a hall step , as depicted in figure [ figure001 ] .",
    "these features were observed in the initial experiments which were performed soon after graphene was discovered in 2004 @xcite @xcite .",
    "later , with stronger magnetic fields and cleaner samples , the formation of new plateaus were discovered at all of the integer steps .",
    "the four - fold degeneracy of the landau levels is partially or completely lifted , depending on the filling fraction @xcite @xcite .",
    "the new plateaus are depicted in figure [ figure002 ] . in particular , the states which originate from the zero mode landau level have interesting properties @xcite-@xcite .    the mechanism for formation of these additional plateaus is thought to be spontaneous symmetry breaking and , like the integer hall effect itself",
    ", it has a beautiful and elegant explanation at weak coupling . here",
    ", we will focus on the charge neutral landau level ( near @xmath6=0 in figures [ figure001 ] and [ figure002 ] ) .",
    "as we have already noted , in an external magnetic field , the single electron spectrum has zero modes and , when we construct the many - electron state in a certain range of densities , these single - electron zero modes must be partially filled .",
    "if electrons are non - interacting , a partially filled landau level is a highly degenerate state , as any partial filling has the same energy as any other partial filling . in this circumstance ,",
    "an interaction , no matter how weak , will generically split the degeneracy of these states .",
    "the most important electron - electron interaction in graphene is the coulomb interaction .",
    "there are good arguments that suggest that , for the quarter- , half- or three - quarters filled zero mode landau level , the coulomb exchange interaction is minimized by states which resolve the four - fold degeneracy by spontaneously breaking the su(4 ) symmetry . once the symmetry is broken , energy gaps and hall plateaus emerge at all integer filling fractions .",
    "this phenomenon is known in the condensed matter literature as quantum hall ferromagnetism @xcite-@xcite and in the particle physics literature as magnetic catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking @xcite-@xcite . in experiments ,",
    "this resolution is now seen for all of the integer hall states @xcite as well as the zero modes . in a clean system ,",
    "the argument for symmetry breaking that we have reviewed here works at arbitrarily weak coupling and gives a candidate for an explanation of this interesting phenomenon .",
    "however , graphene is not weakly coupled .",
    "the coulomb interaction in graphene is putatively strong . where we have used graphene s emergent speed of light which is a factor of 300 less than the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath12 .",
    "this suggests that the coulomb interaction in graphene is strongly coupled and out of the range of perturbation theory .",
    "other indications such as the approximate perfect conical shape of dirac cones seen in arpes measurements @xcite suggest that graphene dynamics is approximately scale invariant and has 2 + 1-dimensional lorentz invariance over a significant range of energy scales .",
    "there is no known truly quantitative mechanism which would explain this .",
    "] in fact , the magnitude of the energy gaps due to symmetry breaking that are seen in experiments is of order the coulomb energy and they are already large enough to conclude that the system is strongly coupled . at a first pass , to understand the occurrence of this symmetry breaking in graphene , it is necessary to understand whether it can also happen in a strongly coupled system , that is , whether the features of quantum hall ferromagnetism survive as the coupling constant",
    "is increased to large values .",
    "reference @xcite gives an affirmative answer to this question in the context of a certain quantum field theory . to be precise ,",
    "the supersymmetric large n gauge field theory that is considered there can not be regarded as a model of graphene in all of its details . on the other hand , as we shall outline below , it may be entirely possible that it does model some of the physics of the charge neutral landau level in graphene . for this reason , among others ,",
    "it is important to have an improved picture of the predictions of the model .    in this paper",
    ", we shall present a significant elaboration on the work in reference @xcite .",
    "that work considered the d3-d5 system which is dual to a superconformal defect quantum field theory which has @xmath13 supersymmetric yang - mills theory living in the bulk of 3 + 1-dimensional spacetime .",
    "the 3 + 1-dimenisonal spacetime is bisected by an infinite , flat 2 + 1-dimensional defect .",
    "a 2 + 1-dimensional hypermultiplet field theory resides on the defect and interacts with the @xmath13 degrees of freedom in the 3 + 1-dimensional bulk .",
    "the defect field theory preserves half of the supersymmetry of the bulk @xmath13 theory and is conformally symmetric for all values of its coupling constant .",
    "the field theory living on the defect has both scalar and spinor fields and the lagrangian is known explicitly @xcite@xcite . at weak coupling ,",
    "its action contains massless fermions and bosons , @xmath14 + \\ldots,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which are fundamental representations of the gauged @xmath15 color and the global @xmath16 flavor symmetries and are @xmath17 and @xmath18 representations of an @xmath19 r - symmetry , respectively .",
    "the masslessness of the fermions is protected by symmetry as there are no possible time reversal invariant mass operators which preserve all of the @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath19 symmetries .",
    "all solutions that we consider are invariant under color @xmath15 , the @xmath20 subgroup of @xmath16 and the first @xmath21",
    ". we will consider solutions which break either the second @xmath21 or the @xmath22 subgroup of @xmath16 or both , and we will call this `` chiral symmetry breaking '' .",
    "this terminology will apply to any solution where the constant @xmath23 defined in equation ( [ asymptoticpsi ] ) in section 3 is nonzero .",
    "this constant is called the `` chiral condensate '' .",
    "the three dots in ( [ weakcouplingaction ] ) indicate the action of @xmath13 yang - mills theory and interaction terms .    a constant @xmath24 external magnetic field , @xmath7 , breaks supersymmetry .",
    "the free fermions and free bosons have different landau level energies , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively , with @xmath27 .",
    "the boson energies have a gap , @xmath28 . at",
    "energies lower than this gap , only the bosonic vacuum is relevant . on the other hand ,",
    "the fermions have zero modes with degeneracy @xmath29 . for states with filling fraction @xmath30 ( with @xmath0 defined in equation ( [ fillingfraction ] ) , in the denominator of that equation .",
    "we are assuming that the su(n ) color symmetry remains unbroken .",
    "thus , we take for candidate states only those which are singlets of the global color symmetry . for a many - body state of quarks to be a color singlet , the number of quarks must be an integer multiple of @xmath8 .",
    "therefore we consider states where the quarks come in multiples of @xmath8 only .",
    "the filling fraction defined in ( [ fillingfraction ] ) is the fractional occupancy of a landau level where this natural n - fold degeneracy is taken into account . ] ) , the lowest energy modes of the sufficiently weakly interacting theory are governed by the problem of populating the fermion zero modes . the arguments for quantum hall ferromagnetism should apply to the @xmath13 gluon - mediated color interaction .",
    "in the large @xmath8 planar limit in particular , the exchange interaction is emphasized and minimizing it should lead to breaking of the @xmath21 chiral symmetry and , depending on the filling fraction , various symmetry breaking patterns for the @xmath16 flavor symmetry .",
    "the states with integer filling fractions @xmath31 should be gapped , incompressible states with integer quantized hall conductivities , though the series could truncate before it gets to @xmath32 if the splitting of the states begins to compete with the energy of bosons , which begins at @xmath28 . from appearing in effective field theory .",
    "this would further isolate the fermion zero modes . ] also , the higher fermionic landau levels are at energies greater than the threshold for creating bosons , so one would expect that they lead to no further incompressible states .",
    "we will see shortly that the counting of possible incompressible states is matched on the strong coupling side which is described by string theory .",
    "the strongly coupled system is described by the embedding of @xmath33 coincident d5-branes in the @xmath34 background . at zero charge density and in the absence of magnetic fields , the d5-brane geometry is @xmath35 , which has superconformal symmetry .",
    "the @xmath36 is a subspace of @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath38 is the maximal volume @xmath38 which can be embedded in @xmath39 .",
    "the embedding position has an @xmath21 symmetry so that an @xmath19 subgroup of the @xmath40 symmetry of @xmath39 survives .    here , and everywhere in the following , we are considering boundary conditions for the embedding problem which do not violate the chiral symmetry of the gauge theory .",
    "this means that , even for other solutions , the worldvolume geometry must approach this maximally symmetric @xmath35 geometry sufficiently rapidly as the d5 brane worldvolume approaches the boundary of @xmath34 . in particular , the @xmath38 must become the @xmath19 symmetric maximal @xmath38 and the @xmath33 multiple d5 branes must become coincident .",
    "the latter condition makes their boundary condition symmetric under @xmath22 .",
    "if the chiral symmetry is broken , it must be by spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "this symmetry breaking occurs if , as the d5 brane worldvolume stretches into the bulk of @xmath34 , either the @xmath38 which the d5 brane wraps deviates at all from the maximal one of the most symmetric embedding , or the d5 branes spread apart , breaking the global @xmath22 symmetry",
    ". we will encounter both of these behaviors shortly .    chiral symmetry breaking : the wedge in the lower left below the red and blue lines are the regions where the abelian d5 brane and the d7 brane , respectively .",
    "have lower energies than the chiral symmetric d5 brane .",
    "the horizontal axis is the filling fraction @xmath41 and the vertical axis is the horizon radius ( which is proportional to the temperature ) , in units of magnetic field .",
    "the parameter @xmath42 is proportional to the number of d5-branes .",
    "plots for three different values of @xmath43 are shown . ]",
    "if we keep the charge density and the temperature at zero and introduce a constant external magnetic field , the d5 brane geometry changes drastically @xcite . near the boundary of @xmath34 ,",
    "the d5 brane is still @xmath35 .",
    "however , as it enters the bulk of @xmath37 , it pinches off and ends before it reaches the poincare horizon of @xmath37 , forming what is called a minkowski embedding .",
    "it can pinch off smoothly without creating a boundary when a cycle shrinks to zero size .",
    "it is the @xmath38 which shrinks and chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "moreover , a minkowski embedding has a charge gap due to the fact that charged excitations are open strings which must be suspended between the worldvolume and the poincare horizon .",
    "when the worldvolume does not reach the poincare horizon , these strings have a minimal length and therefore a gap in their energy spectrum .",
    "thus , the strong coupling limit at @xmath44 has an incompressible , charge - gapped state .",
    "this phenomenon is interpreted as the strong coupling manifestation of magnetic catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "it is reasonable to conjecture that it is precisely the continuation to strong coupling of the formation of a gap at @xmath44 in the neutral landau level which we discussed at weak coupling .",
    "the symmetry breaking pattern is @xmath45 . when a charge density and a temperature are turned on the chiral symmetry breaking phase survives for some range of these parameters , but it is eventually restored if the density or temperature become large enough . limit . ]",
    "the chiral symmetric phase of the d5 brane which is found at large enough temperature or density is simply one where the worldsheet is a product metric of the maximal @xmath38 embedded in @xmath39 and an asymptotically @xmath36 space , together with a configuration of worldvolume electro - magnetic fields which are needed to create the dual of the field theory with nonzero density and magnetic field .",
    "the simple chiral symmetry breaking solutions of the d3-d5 system have been studied extensively in a number of contexts @xcite-@xcite .",
    "their distinguishing feature can be characterized as `` abelian '' , in that the dynamics of each d5-brane in the stack of d5 branes is treated independently and their behaviors are all identical .",
    "the non - abelian nature of the worldvolume theory does not play a role .",
    "the d5 branes remain coincident and have unbroken @xmath22 symmetry .",
    "the phase diagram of these abelian solutions is well known .",
    "it is reproduced in the numerical results of the present paper and corresponds to the red curves in figure [ figure003 ] , [ figure004 ] , and [ compositeplot ] . more specifically , the lower - left - hand wedge in figure [ figure003 ] is the region where the `` abelian '' chiral symmetry breaking solutions of the d5-brane are stable . at the red line ,",
    "the chiral symmetric competitor takes over , in the sense that it has lower energy .",

    "al .  @xcite .",
    "the d7 brane is an alternative solution of the d5 brane theory .. the d7 that we consider collapses to a d5 brane there , and should therefore be thought of as a solution of the d3-d5 system whereas d7 remains a d7 brane . ]",
    "it can be thought of as a `` non - abelian '' configuration of d5 branes which is approximated by a d7 brane @xcite .",
    "the stability region for the d7 brane in the temperature - density plane is similar to that of the abelian d5 brane , but somewhat larger .",
    "it has less energy than the chiral symmetric competitor ( the same competitor as for the abelian d5 brane ) to the lower left of the blue line in figure [ figure003 ] .",
    "the reader should beware that figure [ figure003 ] does not compare the relative energies of the abelian d5 and the d7 branes .",
    "this will be done in figure [ figure004 ] .",
    "phase diagram extracted from numerical data : the red and blue lines are taken from figure [ figure003 ] .",
    "they are lines where the chiral symmetric d5 brane has the same energy as the d5 brane ( red ) and the d7 brane ( blue ) .",
    "the chiral symmetric phase is always more stable to the right and toward the top of the figure .",
    "the green line is where the abelian d5 brane and the d7 brane have the same energy with the abelian d5 preferred to the left and the d7 preferred to the right .",
    "the axes and values of @xmath43 are as in figure [ figure003 ] . ]",
    "we now know of three competing solutions of the d3-d5 system , the abelian d5 brane , the d7 brane and the chiral symmetric solution .",
    "( as we shall see later , for @xmath46 we will in addition have the possibility of composite solutions . )",
    "to decide which is the preferred one at a given value of the temperature and filling fraction , we must compare their free energies .",
    "the free energy is a function of the temperature , the charge density , the magnetic field and the number of d5-branes , @xmath33 .",
    "we will use a system of units where the magnetic field is equal to one .",
    "this leaves a normalized temperature , the filling fraction @xmath0 and the parameter @xmath47 as the variables which define the thermodynamic problem .",
    "we have done a numerical calculation of the energies of the three competing solutions . before we begin to describe it , we warn the reader that , later on , we will find a completely different structure that takes over when the filling fraction @xmath0 is greater than or equal to one , and where the temperature is low .",
    "thus , in the end , the following discussion will only apply to the region @xmath48 .",
    "we will ignore this fact for now and will pursue the following discussion of the relative stabilities of the three solutions that we know about so far for all values of @xmath0 .    in figure [ figure004 ] , the regions where the abelian d5 brane and the d7 brane are more stable than the chiral symmetric solution are displayed for three values of @xmath43 . in all cases ,",
    "the chiral symmetric solution is stable in the upper right - hand part of the diagram .",
    "the abelian d5 brane is stable in the lower left , below the green line , that is , in all cases , for sufficiently small filling fraction and low temperature .",
    "as we increase temperature or filling fraction to the green line , there is a phase transition and , beyond the green line , the d7 brane becomes the energetically preferred solution .",
    "it remains so until we approach the blue line where the chiral symmetric phase becomes more stable and chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "this part of the blue line is beyond the edge of the figures in [ figure004 ] but can be seen in figure [ figure003 ] . in summary , at low temperatures , as we increase the filling fraction from zero , generically there are three phases . first , at low density is the abelian d5 brane . at some value of the density",
    ", there is a phase transition to the d7 brane .",
    "then , at a larger density yet , there is a phase transition to the chiral symmetric state .    at low temperatures ,",
    "the phase transition at the blue line in figures [ figure003 ] and [ figure004 ] is likely always of first order . at zero temperature",
    ", the chiral symmetric phase can be shown analytically to be meta - stable beyond a critical density , which is also known analytically @xcite @xmath49 in all of the cases where we have computed it , the blue line always occurs at higher values of @xmath0 .",
    ", we have observed that the red and blue lines come closer together and it is possible that , for sufficiently large @xmath43 , they will coincide . in that case",
    ", there could be a large @xmath43 region where the the bkt - like transition from either the abelian d5 or d7 brane to the chiral symmetric phase would still exist .",
    "] this means that there is always a region where the d7 brane has lower energy than a meta - stable chiral symmetric phase . in this region",
    ", there must be an energy barrier between the phases .",
    "this indicates a first order phase transition . in the case of the abelian solution at zero temperature",
    ", it is known that the transition to the chiral symmetric phase occurs precisely at @xmath50 and it is bkt like @xcite .",
    "this is the intersection of the red line with the horizontal axis in figures [ figure003 ] and [ figure004 ] .",
    "it is a beautiful and rare example of a non - mean - field phase transition for probe d branes .",
    "however , in all of the cases that we have studied , including those in figure [ figure004 ] , the green line occurs at values @xmath0 smaller than @xmath50 and the d7 brane is more stable than either the abelian d5 or the chiral symmetric d5 in this region - there is no bkt - like transition in these cases .",
    "the three phases that we have discussed so far have distinct symmetry breaking patterns .",
    "the abelian d5 brane phase breaks the @xmath21 symmetry to @xmath51 , but preserves the @xmath22 flavor symmetry .",
    "the d7 brane phase breaks both the @xmath21 symmetry and the @xmath22 leaving only a subgroup of simultaneous transformations in @xmath21 and an @xmath21 subgroup of @xmath22 .",
    "then the chiral symmetric phase retains both the @xmath21 and the @xmath22 .",
    "this pattern of symmetry breaking is one of the predictions of the holographic model .",
    "however , as we have warned the reader .",
    "further developments that we shall outline below will cut this scenario off when the filling fraction reaches @xmath52 .",
    "it is only the behavior which occurs in the interval where @xmath48 which will turn out to be a prediction of what we have done so far .",
    "as we can see by inspecting figures [ figure003 ] and [ figure004 ] , the first transition from abelian d5 to d7 typically occurs in this interval whereas the second , from d7 to chiral symmetric d5 does not .",
    "the abelian d5 brane has the feature that , once a non - zero charge density is turned on , it can no longer have a minkowski embedding .",
    "this means that the theory no longer has a charge gap . without a magnetic field",
    ", this would be natural .",
    "the analog at weak coupling is a finite density of fermions which create a fermi surface .",
    "there are always low energy excitations of a fermi surface .",
    "such a system is not gapped , and this is also what is seen for the abelian d5 brane .",
    "however , the abelian d5 brane also remains ungapped in an external magnetic field , for any value of the magnetic field and any nonzero density .",
    "in other words , besides the @xmath44 state , the abelian d5 brane solutions contain no incompressible states at non - zero filling fractions , even in arbitrarily strong magnetic fields .",
    "the d7 brane , on the other hand , can have incompressible states at special nonzero values of the charge density @xcite .",
    "the d7 brane should properly be regarded as a non - abelian configuration of d5-branes .",
    "it arises in the d5 brane theory when the transverse coordinates of the @xmath33 embedded d5 branes , which are @xmath53 matrices , form a fuzzy sphere .",

    "this scarcity of conducting states could lead to an approximate , dynamically generated quantum hall plateau , a tantalizing possibility since the only other known mechanism for hall plateaus is localization .",

    "one might speculate that solutions corresponding to fractional hall states could be obtained from the integer quantum hall states that we have already found by sl(2,z ) duality which has a natural realization in three dimensional abelian gauge theory @xcite and also a natural action on quantum hall states @xcite @xcite .",
    "in particular , it can map integer quantum hall states to fractional quantum hall states .",

    "a beautiful aspect of the fractional hall states found in reference @xcite is the explicit construction of boundaries and the existence of boundary currents . in our construction , the hall state has a charge gap and it must therefore be a bulk insulator .",
    "the hall current should be carried by edge states .",
    "the edges must be at the asymptotic spatial boundaries .",
    "it would be interesting , following reference @xcite to attempt to construct boundaries or domain walls which would carry the currents .",
