    "<S> the term @xmath106 is negative and less relevant when the flat band becomes more isolated for larger @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath17 increases , the negative contribution of @xmath106 becomes more prominent and for very large @xmath17 it cancels the positive term @xmath13 [ see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : four](a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> this means that pairing has to occur in a subset of all bands for @xmath115 to manifest , and it explains the decreasing trend of @xmath98 in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : four](a)-(b ) . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : five ] , the invariant @xmath129 diverges at @xmath130 , thus the slope of @xmath12 as a function of @xmath17 is infinite at @xmath131 . </S>",
    "<S> however for any nonzero @xmath17 we have verified that this divergence is cured by @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> thus for @xmath130 superfluidity has a truly multiband character . in the opposite limit @xmath132 </S>",
    "<S> one eigenvalue of @xmath129 becomes zero and superfluidity is lost , consistently with the fact that the unit cells become decoupled [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : one](a ) ] . </S>",

    "<S> _ discussion  _ the main result of this work is that topologically trivial flat bands are promising for high-@xmath0 superconductivity , in the same way as topologically nontrivial ones . </S>",
    "<S> indeed a flat band allows to optimize not only the bcs critical temperature  @xcite , but also the superfluid weight [ see figs .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : four](a)-(b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the superfluid weight affects the critical temperature in two dimensions through the berezinsky - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the superfluid weight has geometric origin , i.e. it is proportional to the quantum metric of the flat band [ eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ flatband_cont])-([eq : b ] ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the fingerprint of the geometric origin is the strong dependence of @xmath12 on the coupling constant @xmath17 , possibly observable in ultracold gases where interactions are tunable .    </S>",
    "<S> achieving the superfluid phase of an ultracold gas in an optical lattice is difficult , due to the still too high temperatures ( specific entropies ) currently attainable  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find the bkt transition temperature in the lieb lattice to be @xmath133  @xcite at the optimal coupling @xmath134 [ fig .  [ fig : four](a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> it can be compared with the optimal nel temperature for the 3d repulsive fermi - hubbard model @xmath135  @xcite , which is at the verge of experimental capabilities  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the critical temperatures are substantially higher in three dimensions where , in contrast to the bkt estimate in 2d , one can use the bcs one : @xmath136 for @xmath137 , and @xmath67 in our model . the flat band optimizes the critical temperature , indeed @xmath138 for the flat - band superfluid is twice as high compared to the dispersive bands in our model .    in the solid state context </S>",
    "<S> the geometric contribution to the superfluid weight is expected to be larger for superconductors with high-@xmath0 and provides a possible explanation of the linear relation between superfluid weight and critical temperature in cuprates ( uemura relation  @xcite ) since @xmath139 . </S>",
    "<S> we expect @xmath140 to be significant in models with nontrivial bloch functions also with the different pairing symmetries found in high-@xmath0 superconductors , whose incorporation to our theory for the superfluid weight is an important topic of future research .    </S>",
