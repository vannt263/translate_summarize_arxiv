    "the yang - mills equations in two , three and four dimensions have been intensively studied both in physics and mathematics . in mathematics , this study ( i.e.  projectively flat unitary connections and stable bundles in @xmath7  @xcite , the chern - simons model and knot theory in @xmath8 , instantons and donaldson invariants  @xcite in @xmath9 ) has yielded a lot of new results in differential and algebraic geometry . in particular , a crucial role in @xmath9 gauge theory is played by the first - order anti - self - duality equations , which on manifolds @xmath10 are precisely the chern - simons gradient flow equations .",
    "the program of extending familiar constructions in gauge theory , associated to problems in low - dimensional topology , to higher dimensions , was proposed in  @xcite and developed in  @xcite . an important role in this investigation",
    "is played by first - order gauge equations which are a generalisation of the anti - self - duality equations in @xmath9 to higher - dimensional manifolds with special holonomy ( or , more generally , with @xmath0-structure  @xcite ) .",
    "such equations in @xmath11 dimensions were first introduced in  @xcite and further considered e.g.   in  @xcite . some of their solutions were found e.g.   in  @xcite .    in physics ,",
    "interest in yang - mills theories in dimensions greater than four grew essentially after the discovery of superstring theory , which contains supersymmetric yang - mills in the low - energy limit in the presence of d - branes as well as in the heterotic case .",
    "in particular , heterotic strings yield @xmath12 heterotic supergravity , which contains the @xmath13 supersymmetric yang - mills model as a subsector  @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry - preserving compactifications on spacetimes @xmath14 with further reduction to @xmath15 impose the above - mentioned first - order bps - type gauge equations on @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "initial choices for the internal manifold @xmath17 were khler coset spaces and calabi - yau manifolds , as well as manifolds with exceptional holonomy group @xmath4 for @xmath18 and spin(7 ) for @xmath19 .",
    "however , it was realised that calabi - yau compactifications suffer from the presence of many massless moduli fields in the resulting four - dimensional effective theories",
    ". this problem can be cured ( at least partially ) by allowing for non - trivial @xmath20-form fluxes on  @xmath16 .",
    "string vacua with @xmath20-form fields along the extra dimensions ( ` flux compactifications ' ) have been intensively studied in recent years ( see e.g.  @xcite for reviews , and also the references therein ) .",
    "compactifications in the presence of fluxes can be described in the language of @xmath0-structures on @xmath21-dimensional manifolds @xmath16 : su(3)-structure for dimension @xmath22 , @xmath4-structure for @xmath18 and spin(7)-structure for @xmath19 . in the definition of all these @xmath0-structures there",
    "enters a @xmath23-form @xmath24 on  @xmath16 .",
    "thus , we deal with internal manifolds of special geometry and consider the three - form field  @xmath25 as torsion , where @xmath26 denotes the hodge star operator",
    ". in particular , in six dimensions these manifolds may be non - khler and sometimes even non - complex .",
    "flux compactifications have been investigated primarily for type ii strings and to a lesser extent in the heterotic theories , despite their long history @xcite . the number of torsionful geometries that can serve as a background for heterotic string compactifications seems rather limited . among them",
    "there are six - dimensional nilmanifolds , solvmanifolds , nearly khler and nearly calabi - yau coset spaces .",
    "the last two kinds of manifolds carry a natural almost complex structure which is not integrable ( for a discussion of their geometry see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .    in heterotic string compactifications one has the freedom to choose a gauge bundle since the simple embedding of the spin connection into the gauge connection is ruled out for compactifications with @xmath27 . for the torsionful backgrounds ,",
    "the allowed gauge bundle is restricted by the bianchi identity for the torsion field ( anomaly cancellation ) and by the donaldson - uhlenbeck - yau equations  @xcite for @xmath22 or the @xmath4-instanton equations  @xcite for @xmath18 .",
    "the construction of such vector bundles over @xmath4-manifolds of topology @xmath28 is the subject of the present paper .",
    "the only known examples of compact nearly khler six - manifolds are the four coset spaces  @xmath29 ,  @xmath30 , @xmath31  and  @xmath32 .",
    "on all four cosets @xmath1 we have a torsion @xmath33 for an almost khler form @xmath34 .",
    "we describe some solutions of the donaldson - uhlenbeck - yau equations for the gauge group  @xmath0 on these cosets .",
    "our ansatz for a @xmath0-invariant connection is parameterised by a complex number  @xmath35 , and the solutions show the 3-symmetry characteristic of all nearly khler spaces .",
    "next , we step up to seven dimensions , extending @xmath1 by a real line  @xmath36 , so that @xmath37 in our @xmath0-invariant ansatz . for the torsion  @xmath38 with @xmath39 ,",
    "our ansatz reduces the yang - mills equations to newton s equations @xmath40 for a particle in the complex @xmath35  plane , subject to a 3-symmetric cubic force  @xmath41 . for @xmath42",
    ", there exists a potential of @xmath43 type , so @xmath44 , and an action can be formulated , which surprisingly agrees with the torsionful yang - mills action on our ansatz . yet , even for @xmath45 , we construct an explicit solution .    in special instances ,",
    "@xmath46 is implied by a flow equation @xmath47 .",
    "this flow is gradient or hamiltonian , depending on whether the proportionality is real or imaginary . among the complex @xmath48 trajectories ,",
    "finite - action kinks occur when @xmath49 and @xmath50 , as solutions to the gradient and hamiltonian flow , respectively .",
    "the corresponding connections are finite - action solutions of the yang - mills equations on @xmath51 . by a duality transformation , which relates solutions for different values of  @xmath52 , infinite - action solutions to the yang - mills equations",
    "are presented as well .    the cases @xmath53 and @xmath50 mentioned above",
    "have a clear geometrical meaning .",
    "the corresponding gradient and hamiltonian flow equations for @xmath35 follow from seven - dimensional anti - self - duality conditions based on one of two @xmath4-structures , called the @xmath4-instanton equations .",
    "now , these both descend from anti - self - duality equations based on the spin(7)-structure of the eight - dimensional space @xmath54 . for the gradient case one",
    "reduces over  @xmath55 , while the hamiltonian case arises upon reduction over  @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath4-instanton equations can themselves be interpreted as gradient and hamiltonian flows for a certain action functional on the space of all connections .",
    "we do not know of a similar geometrical interpretation for any other special value of the torsion .",
    "an su(3)-structure on a six - manifold is by definition a reduction of the structure group of the tangent bundle to su(3 )",
    ". manifolds of dimension six with su(3)-structure admit a set of canonical objects fixed by su(3 ) , consisting of an almost complex structure @xmath56 , a riemannian metric @xmath57 , a real two - form @xmath34 and a complex three - form @xmath58 . with respect to @xmath56 ,",
    "the forms @xmath34 and @xmath58 are of type ( 1,1 ) and ( 3,0 ) , respectively , and there is a compatibility condition , @xmath59 . with respect to the volume form @xmath60 of @xmath57 , @xmath34 and @xmath58",
    "are normalised so that @xmath61 a nearly khler six - manifold is an su(3)-structure manifold such that @xmath62 for some real non - zero constant @xmath63 , proportional to the square of the scalar curvature ( if @xmath63 was zero , the manifold would be calabi - yau ) .",
    "nearly khler manifolds were first studied by gray @xcite , and they solve the einstein equations with positive cosmological constant . more generally , six - manifolds with su(3)-structure are classified by their intrinsic torsion , and nearly khler manifolds form one particular intrinsic torsion class .",
    "there are only four known examples of compact nearly khler six - manifolds , and they are all coset spaces : @xmath64 here @xmath65 is chosen to be a non - maximal subgroup of @xmath66 : if elements of @xmath66 are written as @xmath67 quaternionic matrices , then elements of @xmath65 are written @xmath68 , with @xmath69 and @xmath70 . also , @xmath71 is the diagonal subgroup of @xmath72 .",
    "these coset spaces @xmath1 were named 3-symmetric by wolf and gray , because the subgroup @xmath73 is the fixed point set of an automorphism @xmath74 of @xmath0 satisfying @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "the 3-symmetry actually plays a fundamental role in defining the canonical structures on the coset spaces .",
    "the automorphism @xmath74 induces an automorphism @xmath76 of the lie algebra @xmath77 of @xmath0 , that is @xmath78 is linear and satisfies @xmath79 { \\ = \\ } s[x , y ] \\qquad \\forall x , y\\in\\mathfrak{g}\\ .\\ ] ] the cosets under consideration are all reductive , which means that there is a decomposition @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the lie algebra of @xmath73 and @xmath82 satisfies @xmath83\\subset\\mathfrak{m}$ ] .",
    "actually , on @xmath84 there is a choice of subspaces @xmath82 ; we choose @xmath82 so that it is orthogonal to @xmath81 with respect to the cartan - killing form in this case .",
    "the map @xmath76 acts trivially on @xmath81 and non - trivially on @xmath82 ; one can define a map @xmath85 by @xmath86 the map @xmath56 satisfies @xmath87 and provides the almost complex structure on @xmath1 .    a natural quadratic form on @xmath82 is given by the cartan - killing form of @xmath77 , @xmath88 this extends to a @xmath0-invariant metric @xmath57 on @xmath1 .",
    "the ( 1,1)-form @xmath34 is fixed by its compatibility with @xmath57 and @xmath56 , and @xmath58 is the unique suitably normalised @xmath0-invariant ( 3,0)-form .      in calculations ,",
    "it is useful to choose a basis @xmath89 for the lie algebra @xmath77 .",
    "we do so in such a way that @xmath90 for @xmath91 form a basis for @xmath82 and @xmath92 for @xmath93 yield a basis for @xmath81 .",

    "then @xmath96 is totally antisymmetric .",
    "the reductive property of the coset means that the structure constants @xmath97 vanish .",
    "the components @xmath98 of the almost complex structure @xmath56 are defined via @xmath99 . then the 3-symmetry property ( [ 3 symmetry ] )",
    "implies useful identities involving @xmath56 : notably , the tensor @xmath100 is totally antisymmetric ; also @xmath101    another useful identity is @xmath102 we do not have a general proof of this identity , but we have verified it on each of the four coset spaces .",
    "it has the following interpretation : the action of @xmath73 on @xmath82 defines an embedding of @xmath73 in @xmath103 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath73 fixes the quadratic form @xmath104 and almost complex structure @xmath56 ; hence @xmath73 is contained in @xmath105 .",
    "the above identity merely asserts that @xmath106 .",
    "geometrically , this means that the natural @xmath73-structure on @xmath1 is contained within the @xmath107-structure .",
    "apart from @xmath104 , there are two other natural quadratic forms on @xmath82 : @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 denote the projections onto @xmath82 and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath111 furthermore , on the coset spaces in question , one also has @xmath112 hence , in terms of the structure constants , @xmath113 the proof of this identity will be deferred until the end of this section . note that for three of the four coset spaces this identity has been verified directly in @xcite .",
    "the metric and almost complex structure on @xmath82 lift to a @xmath0-invariant metric and almost complex structure on @xmath1 .",
    "local expressions for these can be obtained by introducing an orthonormal frame as follows .",
    "the basis elements @xmath114 of the lie algebra @xmath77 can be represented by left - invariant vector fields @xmath115 on the lie group @xmath0 , and the dual basis @xmath116 is a set of left - invariant one - forms .",
    "the space @xmath1 consists of left cosets @xmath117 and the natural projection @xmath118 is denoted @xmath119 . over a contractible open subset @xmath120 of @xmath1 , one can choose a map @xmath121 such that @xmath122 is the identity ( in other words , @xmath123 is a local section of the principal bundle @xmath124 ) .",
    "the pull - backs of @xmath116 by @xmath123 are denoted @xmath125 .",

    "the forms @xmath125 obey the maurer - cartan equations , @xmath133 since all the connections we consider will be invariant under some action of @xmath0 , it will suffice to do calculations just over the subset @xmath120 .    local expressions for the @xmath0-invariant metric , almost complex structure , and nearly khler form on @xmath1",
    "are then @xmath134 one can also obtain a local expression for ( 3,0)-form @xmath58 . from ( [ mc ] )",
    "one can compute @xmath135 and hence @xmath136 : @xmath137 we have that @xmath138 , and @xmath58 should be normalised so that @xmath139 .",
    "on the other hand , from ( [ f identity 4 ] ) we compute that @xmath140 .",
    "so it must be that @xmath141 and @xmath142    given a pair of differential forms @xmath143 such that the degree of @xmath144 is less than or equal to the degree of @xmath145 , their contraction is defined to be @xmath146 if @xmath144 and @xmath145 have the same degree , @xmath147 coincides with the usual inner product of forms induced by the metric .",
    "we are now in a position to prove ( [ f identity 4 ] ) : from ( [ omega ] ) , it is equivalent to @xmath148 this identity holds on any 6-manifold with su(3)-structure , as can be verified by direct calculation in an orthonormal basis .",
    "let @xmath24 be a @xmath23-form on a @xmath21-dimensional riemannian manifold .",
    "a natural generalisation of the @xmath9 anti - self - duality equations is the so - called @xmath24-anti - self - duality equation , @xmath149 if @xmath24 is closed , this equation implies the yang - mills equation , @xmath150 .",
    "equations of this sort were first written down in @xcite , using the language of tensors rather than differential forms .",
    "they often have an interpretation as bps equations , in particular all of the @xmath24-anti - self - duality equations considered in this paper are bps equations .    on a nearly khler six - manifold ,",
    "a natural choice for @xmath24 is the ( 1,1)-form @xmath34 , giving @xmath151 of course , @xmath34 is not closed , so ( [ omega sd ] ) does not imply the yang - mills equation , but rather the yang - mills equation with torsion ,",
    "@xmath152 the @xmath34-anti - self - duality equation  ( [ omega sd ] ) means that we are looking for eigen - two - forms @xmath153 of the operator @xmath154 , with eigenvalue @xmath155 .",
    "the space @xmath156 of two - forms decomposes into three eigenspaces @xmath157 , with the following properties : @xmath158 hence , ( [ omega sd ] ) is equivalent to the so - called donaldson - uhlenbeck - yau , or hermitian - yang - mills , equations  @xcite : @xmath159    it is interesting to note that when @xmath153 solves the @xmath34-anti - self - duality equation ( [ omega sd ] ) , the torsional term in the yang - mills equation ( [ ym torsion 1 ] ) vanishes , as was pointed out by xu @xcite .",
    "this is because @xmath153 is a ( 1,1)-form and @xmath135 is a sum of ( 3,0)- and ( 0,3)-forms : their wedge product then has to vanish .",
    "first we consider @xmath73-instantons on @xmath1 .",
    "the natural projection @xmath124 defines a principal bundle with structure group @xmath73 , on which @xmath0 acts from the left .",
    "there is a unique @xmath0-invariant connection on this bundle , the so - called canonical connection @xcite . on @xmath160",
    "the canonical connection is the dirac monopole and on @xmath161 it is the sum of an instanton and an anti - instanton , so it seems a good candidate solution to ( [ omega sd ] ) on a nearly khler coset space .    in local coordinates ,",
    "the canonical connection is written @xmath162 its curvature @xmath163 is given in @xcite , chapter ii , theorem 11.1 , and is also easily computed using ( [ mc ] ) : @xmath164 the identity ( [ f identity 2 ] ) implies that this @xmath153 is a ( 1,1)-form , since ( 1,1)-forms @xmath165 are defined by the property @xmath166 . the identity ( [ f identity 3 ] )",
    "tells us that @xmath167 , where @xmath168 .",
    "so on each of the four nearly khler coset spaces , the canonical connection satisfies the donaldson - uhlenbeck - yau equation ( [ duy equation ] ) , or equivalently the @xmath34-anti - self - duality equation ( [ omega sd ] ) .",
    "the case @xmath169 was considered by xu @xcite , who also showed that the canonical connection admits no continuous deformation preserving ( [ omega sd ] ) .",
    "in other words , this connected component of the moduli space of solutions consists of just a point .",
    "next , we consider @xmath0-instantons on @xmath1 . according to @xcite and @xcite , @xmath0-invariant connections with gauge group @xmath0",
    "are determined by linear maps @xmath170 which commute with the adjoint action of @xmath73 : @xmath171 .",
    "such a linear map is represented by a matrix @xmath172 , such that @xmath173 , and in local coordinates the connection is written @xmath174 we make the simple choice @xmath175 for real numbers @xmath176 and @xmath177 , which is more general than the choice considered in @xcite . on the space @xmath178 , ( [ ansatz ] ) with ( [ phichoice ] ) is the most general @xmath4-invariant connection , but on the other coset spaces it is not  we will briefly discuss more general choices in the next section .",
    "the curvature @xmath179 is given in @xcite , chapter ii , theorem 11.7 , and can also be computed using ( [ mc ] ) : @xmath180 where @xmath181 .",
    "note that @xmath153 remembers the 3-symmetry @xmath76 : @xmath182    the two - forms @xmath183 are clearly of type ( 2,0)+(0,2 ) , since @xmath135 is of type ( 3,0)+(0,3 ) .",
    "so this connection solves the @xmath34-anti - self - duality equation ( [ omega sd ] ) if and only if @xmath184 apart from the canonical connection @xmath185 , the other solutions to this equation are @xmath186 note that these connections in fact all have zero curvature .",
    "on a @xmath21-dimensional riemannian manifold , the yang - mills equation with torsion is @xmath188 with @xmath189 a three - form .",

    "differentiating , one sees that this equation implies the yang - mills equation ( [ ym torsion 2 ] ) with torsion given by @xmath53 , on identifying @xmath346 .",
    "further , a solution of the anti - self - duality equation ( [ omega sd ] ) on @xmath1 pulls back to a @xmath193-independent solution of ( [ xi sd ] ) .",
    "let us rewrite ( [ xi sd ] ) in components .",
    "this is easily done using the fact that ( [ xi sd ] ) is equivalent to @xmath347 for tangent vectors @xmath348 . with @xmath349 ( [ xi sd ] )",
    "is equivalent to @xmath350 the second relation is the flow equation introduced in @xcite .",
    "we have shown in section  [ sec3 ] that the first relation is satisfied by our ansatz ( [ ansatz2 ] ) ; substituting this ansatz into the second relation yields precisely the gradient flow equation ( [ gradient flow ] ) for @xmath351 .",
    "we now repeat the discussion of the previous subsection , but with the roles of @xmath310 and @xmath311 reversed . we regard @xmath311 as a coordinate on the factor @xmath194 of @xmath309 , denote by @xmath352",
    "the metric induced from @xmath331 and choose the volume form @xmath353 .",

    "in particular , if @xmath153 is a connection on @xmath309 pulled back to @xmath316 , then ( [ sigma sd ] ) is equivalent to @xmath358 which second - order equation is implied by ( [ xi sd ] ) ? differentiating , one obtains @xmath359 taking into account the equivalence of ( [ xi sd ] ) and @xmath360 , one arrives at the yang - mills equation  ( [ ym torsion 2 ] ) with torsion for @xmath297 .",
    "the component form of ( [ xi sd ] ) is @xmath361 with the ansatz ( [ ansatz2 ] ) , the first equation is again automatically satisfied , while the second one is exactly equivalent to the hamiltonian flow equation ( [ hamiltonian flow ] ) with @xmath239 .",
    "the fixed points of the gradient flow or hamiltonian flow equations are the critical points of the superpotential  @xmath262 .",
    "for the special u(1)-symmetric case @xmath280 , the superpotential ( [ superpotential -3 ] ) yields the fixed points @xmath362 . from the discussion in section [ sec3 ] it is clear that these are the solutions of the @xmath34-self - duality equation , @xmath363 for a @xmath0-invariant connection on @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , differentiating this equation gives the yang - mills equation ( [ ym torsion 2 ] ) with torsion via @xmath280 .",
    "this simple geometrical interpretation for the static solutions does not seem to extend to the general solutions of the flow equation  ( [ gradient flow ] ) in this situation .",
    "note that the @xmath34-self - dual equation is not a bps equation .",
    "we close with a second interpretation of the @xmath4-instanton equations ( [ xi sd ] ) and ( [ xi sd ] ) , which accounts for the appearance of a superpotential with gradient and hamiltonian flows in section  [ sec5 ] .    in his thesis @xcite",
    ", xu noted that the @xmath34-anti - self - duality equation ( [ omega sd ] ) is equivalent to @xmath364 we have already seen that ( [ omega sd ] ) implies ( [ vanishing torsion ] ) . to show the converse",
    ", we first observe that ( [ vanishing torsion ] ) implies @xmath365 .",
    "it follows that @xmath366 second , differentiating and applying the bianchi identity yields @xmath367 thus , @xmath153 contains only a ( 1,1 ) part orthogonal to  @xmath34 .",
    "since the donaldson - uhlenbeck - yau equations  ( [ duy equation ] ) are equivalent to  ( [ omega sd ] ) , this proves the assertion .",
    "xu then introduced an action @xmath368 for a connection on a nearly khler six - manifold @xmath17 , whose equation of motion is ( [ vanishing torsion ] ) and whose gradient flow equation is @xmath369 given a local orthonormal frame @xmath126 for the cotangent bundle of @xmath17 , we contract both sides with the @xmath126 . employing the identity @xmath370",
    "one sees that the flow equation is equivalent to @xmath371 which coincides with the second equation of ( [ xi sd comp ] ) after a rescaling in @xmath193 .",
    "thus , the @xmath4-instanton equation ( [ xi sd ] ) implies the gradient flow for the action ( [ superpotential ] ) .",
    "this explains why ( [ xi sd ] ) reduces to a gradient flow equation for @xmath35 .",
    "substituting the ansatz ( [ ansatz2 ] ) into ( [ superpotential ] ) should give something proportional to the superpotential ( [ w ] ) , and this is easily verified : @xmath372 \\\\ & { \\ = \\ } -\\mathrm{vol}(g / h)\\,(1 + 3w)\\ .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similarly , the hamiltonian flow equation for ( [ superpotential ] ) is @xmath373 this is equivalent to the second equation of ( [ xi sd comp ] ) , and reduces to the hamiltonian flow for @xmath262 .",
    "finally , we comment on the relation between the gradient and hamiltonian flow equations and the remaining part of the @xmath4-instanton equations , @xmath167 ( the first equation in ( [ xi sd comp ] ) or ( [ xi sd comp ] ) ) . by employing the identities @xmath374 and @xmath375 , the gradient flow ( [ xu flow ] ) can be rearranged to read @xmath376 by taking the exterior derivative , and using the fact that @xmath377 , this equation implies @xmath378 a similar argument shows that , for the hamiltonian flow ( [ xu flow ] ) , @xmath379 .",
    "so , we should not be surprised that @xmath167 holds for our gradient and hamiltonian flows : if one requires this to hold at @xmath240 , it will hold everywhere .",
    "it is a curious fact that a nearly khler structure can itself be regarded as a critical point of a hamiltonian flow @xcite  perhaps there is some connection between this and the gradient and hamiltonian flows described above .",
