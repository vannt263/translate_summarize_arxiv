    "we consider the iterative solution of the linear system @xmath0 where @xmath1 is symmetric positive definite(spd ) .",
    "it is well known that the convergence of krylov subspace method for solving linear system highly depends on the eigenvalue distribution .",
    "recently many studies@xcite have shown that removing the very small eigenvalues makes the spectrum more clustered and consequently the convergence is improved .",
    "preconditioners based on deflation technique and coarse grid correction are two main types of the spectral preconditioners that deflate or shift small eigenvalues .    to describe the preconditioners discussed in the following sections , we define @xmath2 the matrix of the form ( [ de : projection ] )",
    "is referred to as projection matrix .",
    "the subspace spanned by the columns of @xmath3 is referred to as coarse grid space in domain decomposition method or deflation space in deflation method . in ideal case",
    ", the coarse grid space or deflation space should contain the vectors corresponding to the lower part of the spectrum that are responsible for the stagnation in convergence . section 2",
    "will show that the preconditioned systems have good properties when the preconditioners are constructed with the ideal subspace .",
    "for simplicity , we refer to the subspace spanned by the columns of @xmath3 as coarse grid space throughout the paper .",
    "in particular , we refer to the coarse grid space spanned by the eigenvectors associated with the small eigenvalues of @xmath4 as the exact coarse grid space .    in @xcite ,",
    "the deflation preconditioner is defined by @xmath5 obviously @xmath6 is singular since @xmath7 is singular .",
    "fortunately , krylov subspace methods can still solve singular linear system as long as it is consistent ; furthermore , zero eigenvalues do not impact the convergence since the corresponding eigenvectors never enter the iteration . to measure the convergence rate of krylov subspace methods for symmetric positive semidefinite system , the effective condition number@xcite , @xmath8 ,",
    "is defined by the ratio of the maximal to the minimal nonzero eigenvalues .",
    "in contrast to the deflation method , the preconditioners based on coarse grid correction shift the small eigenvalues to the large ones . in @xcite , a well - known coarse grid correction preconditioner in domain decomposition method is defined by @xmath9 the abstract additive coarse - grid correction is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the sum of the local solves in each subdomain .",
    "another well - known preconditioner in domain decomposition method is the abstract balancing preconditioner@xcite @xmath12 the adapted deflation preconditioner@xcite is defined by @xmath13 it has been shown in @xcite that @xmath14 is less expensive than @xmath15 but as robust as @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , @xmath16 and @xmath17 have identical spectrum . in both @xmath15 and @xmath14 ,",
    "the first item is responsible for the fine grid and the second item term for the coarse grid .",
    "so they are called two - level preconditioners . in this paper",
    ", we confine our analysis on one - level methods .",
    "thus we let @xmath18 and define @xmath19 by @xmath20    let @xmath21 be a basis of coarse grid space .",
    "obviously the following equation @xmath22 holds in exact arithmetic since there exists a nonsingular matrix @xmath23 such that @xmath24 .",
    "that means @xmath7 , @xmath25 and @xmath19 are determined uniquely by coarse grid space .",
    "thus we can choose an appropriate basis to form @xmath3 and then construct preconditioners . in section 3 , we will show this fact is helpful for the analysis .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly review the spectral properties of the preconditioned system when all preconditioners are constructed with the exact coarse grid space and inverse of projection matrix .",
    "section 3 presents the perturbation analysis on the spectrum of the preconditioned system when the three preconditioners are constructed with the coarse grid space spanned by the approximate eigenvectors .",
    "section 4 anlyses the spectrum of the preconditioned system when the inverse of the projection matrix are solved inexactly .",
    "numerical results are presented in section 5 .",
    "let @xmath26 be an eigenpair of @xmath4 and @xmath27 be normalized .",
    "@xmath28 is orthogonal since @xmath4 is spd .",
    "the spectral decomposition of @xmath4 can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 . in this section",
    ", we assume that the eigenvalues of @xmath34 are the small ones to be removed and that the three preconditioners are constructed with @xmath35 and the exact inverse of projection matrix .",
    "[ th : tp_d ] let @xmath36 then @xmath37 is symmetric and has the following spectral decomposition @xmath38 in addition , @xmath39 .",
    "obviously , @xmath37 is symmetric and @xmath40 . from the definition of @xmath41",
    ", we have @xmath42 then we obtain @xmath43 thus the first result holds .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "thus @xmath39 .",
    "[ th : tp_c ] let @xmath46 then @xmath47 is symmetric and has the following spectral decomposition @xmath48 in addition , @xmath49 .",

    "in addition , it follows from these theorems that @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the spectral condition number@xcite .",
    "in practice for a large system , it is rather expensive to obtain the exact coarse grid space spanned by eigenvectors .",
    "an alternative to make the coarse grid space have rich information on eigenvectors is to build a large subspace@xcite .",
    "however , this way will lead to a large projection matrix whose inverse is also expensive to solve exactly .",
    "so it is natural to construct preconditioners by replacing the exact coarse grid space by an approximate one and computing @xmath57 approximately .",
    "we hope that the system preconditioned by the resulting preconditioners has the similar eigenvalue distribution as described in the previous section so that the convergence can be improved .",
    "that motivates us to analyse how the perturbation in the coarse grid space impacts the spectrum of the preconditioned system .",
    "and @xmath57 impacts the spectrum of the preconditioned system .",
