    "it has been one of the most important issues to clarify the dynamical behavior of the gauge freedom and its effect to the fermion spectrum for various proposals of lattice chiral gauge theory@xcite . in this article",

    "gauge symmetry is explicitly broken by the complex phase of fermion determinant . in order to restore the gauge invariance , gauge average the integration along gauge orbit",
    "is invoked .",
    "then , what is required for the dynamical nature of the gauge freedom at @xmath0 ( pure gauge limit ) is that the global gauge symmetry is not broken spontaneously and all the bosonic field of the gauge freedom could be heavy compared to a typical mass scale of the theory so as to decouple from physical spectrum@xcite . for this mechanism of the gauge symmetry restoration to work",
    ", the gauge symmetry breaking must be `` small '' so that it does not spoil the disordered nature of the gauge freedom and it keeps the correlation length of the gauge freedom in the order of the lattice spacing .    in the previous paper on the two - dimensional nonabelian gauge theory@xcite",
    ", we have discussed that a certain gauge symmetry breaking term turns out to be the asymptotically free self - coupling of the gauge freedom and it can be made `` large '' without spoiling the disordered nature of the gauge freedom . using this technique to deform the original theory ,",
    "we have argued that the disordered gauge degree of freedom does not necessarily cause the massless chiral state in the ( waveguide ) boundary correlation function@xcite .",
    "we have also argued that the decoupling of the gauge freedom can occur as the self - coupling is removed , provided that the ir fixed point due to the wess - zumino - witten term is absent by anomaly cancellation .",
    "our objective in this paper is to extend the above argument to nonabelian chiral gauge theory in _ four - dimensions_. for this purpose , we reminds us the following facts noticed by hata@xcite some time ago : _ at @xmath0 , the covariant gauge fixing term turns into an asymptotically free self - coupling of the gauge freedom in terms of gauge parameter and the severe ir divergence , which occurs in the perturbation ( spinwave ) expansion , prevents local order parameters from emerging_. these dynamical properties are quite similar to the two - dimensional nonlinear sigma model and they suggest that the gauge freedom acquires mass dynamically and the global gauge symmetry does not break spontaneously for the entire region of the gauge parameter .",
    "this is the very nature of the gauge freedom which is required for the dynamical restoration of the gauge symmetry in the lattice chiral gauge theory .    with this dynamical picture in mind",
    ", we first introduce the covariant gauge fixing term and the faddeev - popov determinant by hand into the lattice chiral gauge theory defined by the vacuum overlap _ as a weight for the gauge average_. then we examine the pure gauge model at @xmath0 by the perturbation expansion _ in the presence of the gauge symmetry breaking terms of the complex phase of chiral determinants_. we will find at one - loop that the model is actually renormalizable and the self - coupling is asymptotically free .",
    "we will see that the ir structure remains same and it prevents local order parameters from emerging .",
    "we will also see that this ir structure is not affected by the small perturbation of the gauge symmetry breaking term linear in the link variables , in accord with the foerster - nielsen - ninomiya mechanism .",
    "based on these observations , we will assume that the gauge freedom acquires mass dynamically and the global gauge symmetry does not break spontaneously in the pure gauge limit .    with this assumption",
    ", we can make an argument just as in the case of the two - dimensional nonabelian theory .",
    "namely , the asymptotic freedom allows us to tame the gauge fluctuation by approaching the critical point of the gauge freedom without spoiling its disordered nature .",
    "there we will show by the spinwave approximation that the spectrum in the _ invariant boundary correlation function _ has mass gap of the order of the lattice cutoff and it survives the quantum correction due to the gauge fluctuation .",
    "there is no symmetry against the spectrum mass gap .",
    "since the overlap correlation function does not depend on the gauge freedom and does show the chiral spectrum@xcite , the above fact means that the entire fermion spectrum is chiral .",
    "we will not discuss here how the decoupling of the gauge freedom could occur as the self - coupling is removed , because we do not know yet much about the non - perturbative dynamics of the pure gauge model .",
    "we will leave this issue for future study .",
    "the lattice formulation of the four - dimensional pure gauge model and the possibility to examine it by the monte carlo simulation will be discussed elsewhere@xcite .",
    "a few comments are in order .",
    "the covariant gauge fixing term and the faddeev - popov determinant ( faddeev - popov ghost fields ) are introduced in the gauge fixing approach for lattice chiral gauge theory of the rome group@xcite . there _ the restoration of the brst invariance _ is attempted non - perturbatively by adding and tuning gauge non - invariant counter terms . since the chiral gauge symmetry is explicitly broken by the lattice fermion regularization , the addition of the gauge fixing term does not mean the gauge fixing .",
    "the integration over the compact gauge link variables means that we are still invoking the gauge average .",
    "what is meant by the gauge fixing approach is _ to decouple the gauge degree of freedom kinematically with the help of the brst invariance _ which could be restored by the fine tuning of the gauge non - invariant counter terms . in this approach",
    ", the global gauge symmetry does not need to be realized linearly ( symmetrically ) and the gauge degree of freedom does not need to be disordered .    in this spirit of the gauge fixing approach",
    ", the dynamics of the gauge degree of freedom has been examined by shamir and golterman in the model with the covariant - type gauge fixing term@xcite .",
    "one of the points on which the authors put a stress , among others , is that _ the continuum limit should be taken inside the broken phase , because of the species doubling problem in the symmetric phase_. in the broken phase , both the fermions ( including species doublers ) and the gauge boson acquire masses proportional to the vacuum expectation value of the gauge freedom ( higgs field ) .",
    "accordingly , the main concern in the analysis is to seek the critical points inside the broken phase at which the gauge boson becomes massless while keeping the species doublers heavy .",
    "the authors identified the boundary between the two broken phases , the ferromagnetic phase(fm ) and the helicoidal - ferromagnetic phase(fmd ) , as such critical points .",
    "the latter is characterized by the _",
    "vectorial local order parameter which breaks spontaneously the translation and rotation invariance_. tuning the bare parameters towards this boundary is regarded as the first step to restore the brst invariance .",
    "although we also introduce the covariant gauge fixing term and the faddeev - popov determinant as a weight for the gauge average , we do not try to recover the brst invariance .",
    "rather , we seek the possibility to keep the gauge symmetry breaking as small as possible and to restore the gauge symmetry at low energy by the mechanism of foerster - nielsen - ninomiya in the case of the compact nonabelian gauge group .",
    "this requires that the global gauge symmetry is not broken spontaneously and that the gauge degree of freedom is kept disordered and heavy compared to the physical scale .",
    "( for this very requirement , we admit certain fine tuning of the gauge non - invariant counter terms . ) in the overlap formulation , the gauge symmetry breaking is reduced into only the parity odd ( imaginary ) terms of the chiral determinant . a possible dynamical but perturbative picture for the gauge symmetry restoration for the nonabelian theory",
    "is given by hata , as described above . in this setting , we try to show that _ the disordered nature of the gauge freedom does not contradict with the chiral fermion spectrum _ in the overlap formulation .",
    "we invoke the spinwave approximation in order to discuss _ the symmetric phase dynamics _ , which validity has been argued in several interesting contexts of the two - dimensional quantum field theories . in order to investigate this dynamical possibility fully , we need the non - perturbative study of the model which could incorporate the effect of the complex action .",
    "we hope that the perturbative analysis presented here will give us a physical and dynamical picture how the lattice chiral gauge theory could emerge through the gauge average , and will motivate us to do such non - perturbative study of the dynamics of the gauge symmetry restoration .",

    "what we showed first is that even in the presence of these gauge ( brst ) symmetry breaking terms , the model is renormalizable at one - loop and the self - coupling of the gauge freedom is indeed asymptotically free .",
    "the ir divergence also occurs and it prevents local order parameters from emerging .",
    "therefore , as in the continuum theory , the gauge degree of freedom is disordered at @xmath0 . in this analysis",
    ", we also found that the lattice gribov copies are no more the stationary points of the total action and should be suppressed in the gauge average .",
    "because of the lack of the gauge ( brst ) symmetry , however , it is expected that the gauge non - invariant divergent and finite terms would be induced at some higher but finite orders . in order to clarify the effect of such terms",
    ", we next performed the perturbative analysis of the foerster - nielsen - ninomiya mechanism .",
    "namely , we introduced the explicit real gauge symmetry breaking term , @xmath192 , and examined how this term would spoil the disordered nature of the gauge freedom or how small the breaking term must be in order to keep that nature . although it is small for small @xmath41 , we found a finite region of the coupling constant of @xmath192 for which the effect of the breaking term does not alter the power - law long distance behavior of the invariant two - point function of the gauge freedom .",
    "this means that , even if the gauge breaking term of the type @xmath192 is induced , by tuning the counter term , we can keep the disordered nature of the gauge freedom . from this analysis ,",
    "the phase structure of the pure gauge model was also argued .",
    "we also found that the model remains renormalizable with @xmath192 and that the foerster - nielsen - ninomiya mechanism in this perturbative framework is closely related to the ir regularization prescription of the continuum perturbation theory by the mass term for the gauge boson .",
    "based on these dynamical features , which is quite similar to the nonlinear sigma model in two - dimensions , and following hata s scenario for the dynamical gauge symmetry restoration , we then assumed that the global gauge symmetry does not break spontaneously and the gauge freedom acquires mass dynamically in the pure gauge limit for the entire region of the gauge parameter .    under this assumption ,",
    "the asymptotic freedom allows us to tame the gauge fluctuation by approaching the critical point of the gauge freedom without spoiling its disordered nature .",
    "there we showed by the perturbation expansion that the spectrum in the invariant boundary correlation functions , which is free from ir divergence , have mass gap of the order of the lattice cutoff and it survives the quantum correction due to the gauge fluctuation .",
    "there is no symmetry against the spectrum mass gap .",
    "this means that no light state appear in the boundary correlation functions and they can not be regarded as physically relevant observables .    from the overlap correlation functions ,",
    "on the other hand , the gauge degree of freedom decouples completely .",
    "this is a remarkable property of the overlap correlation function .",
    "it makes it easy and clear to identify the fermion spectrum in the pure gauge limit .",
    "in fact , the correct number of free weyl fermions emerge from this correlation function .",
    "the appearance of the poles of species doublers are suppressed by the appearance of zeros at the vanishing momenta for doublers .",
    "therefore the entire fermion spectrum is chiral and consistent with the continuum target theory .",
    "thus we argued that the dynamical restoration of the gauge symmetry due to the disordered gauge degree of freedom does not contradict with the chiral fermion spectrum in the vacuum overlap formulation of lattice @xmath1 chiral gauge theory .",
