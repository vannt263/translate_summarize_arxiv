    "disordered vortex tangles appear , when helium is made turbulent under thermal counterflow velocity or using grids or propellers @xcite , for example by moving a grid at @xmath4 where , @xmath5 @xcite or by a vibrating - wire resonator in b - phase superfluid @xmath3he ( @xmath3he - b ) @xcite .",
    "large scale turbulence of quantized vortices was studied in superfluid @xmath3he - b @xcite and @xmath2he @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of turbulence in bec is the small system size and the relatively low number of vortices . on the other hand ,",
    "the advantage is the relatively good visualization in detail of the individual vortices .    in",
    "magnetically or optically trapped rotating atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , vortex lattices with quantized vortices along the rotation axis are formed . the density and phase of becs can be directly observed .",

    "this is also confirmed by the fact that , @xmath120 .",
    "we consider a strongly interacting 2d bec in a harmonic trap rotating at the angular frequency , @xmath36 .",
    "the numerical calculations are performed with the semi - implicit , crank - nicholson method in a square box of size @xmath121 @xmath122 ( h.o.u . ) .",
    "first , we create a non - rotating condensate at @xmath123 , and later @xmath36 is set to @xmath124 to create a stable lattice of @xmath125 vortices in a rotating frame .",
    "physical quantities of the becs like density and phase can be clearly observed .",
    "arrays of vortices are shown by the density profile of the condensate for @xmath126 at @xmath127 , see fig .",

    "rotation of a superfluid takes place via abrikosov lattice of quantised vortices , where the rotational velocity profile mimics solid body rotation .",
    "away from vortex cores the superfluid is irrotational . for vortex lattice with @xmath54 vortices ,",
    "the circulation becomes , @xmath129 and the vortex density depends only on @xmath36 , as we can see from its expression , @xmath130 .",
    "here , @xmath36 is the angular velocity of the trapping potential and @xmath54 is the number of vortices .",
    "the circulation of the fluid is quantised in units of @xmath131 .",
    "disordered vortex arrays are produced with the help of the following method : @xmath0 is instantaneously changed to @xmath1 in the upper half part of the box ( @xmath132 ; the center of the box is at @xmath133=[0,0]$ ] ) .",
    "that means that , the condensate is divided into two equal parts with opposite rotation .",
    "the upper part rotates anti clockwise and the bottom part rotates clockwise .",
    "these anti - vortices in the upper part of the condensate change their sense of rotation and are visualized by fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] ( down ) .",
    "this method is a shock for the condensate .",
    "first , the largest part of the upper side of the condensate becomes deformed and after some shaking movements , see fig .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] , the system recovers its circle - like form again with turbulence , shown by fig .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] .",
    "so , the method can thus be used to create a 2d turbulence in the same way as in the classical onsager vortex gas @xcite .    after using of this method",
    ", we distinguish two different cases : @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "we analyze the total number , @xmath54 of vortices , as well as the number @xmath136 , of positive and @xmath137 , of negative vortices ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : f6 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : f7 ] ) under certain conditions , for example keeping @xmath36 constant or not . for @xmath128",
    ", after a certain transition period , the system enters the state which is the same as the original regular vortex lattice .",
    "first , we create vortex lattice in a rotating trapped bec . then , we change the wave function with its complex conjugate by instantaneously reversing the direction of rotation of the atoms in the top half part of the box . as a consequence , in the upper part of the trap , we transform vortices into their anti - vortices rotating in the opposite direction .",
    "thus , we suggest a method to create a system of positive and negative vortices in a disk - shaped condensate , which is divided into two equal parts rotating in opposite directions , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : f1 ] ( down ) . to prepare the right conditions for turbulence , at @xmath138 , the rotation frequency ,",
    "@xmath36 was set to @xmath139 . as a result , the kinetic energy , @xmath14 and the @xmath37-component of the angular momentum , @xmath140 tend to zero , ( see , fig .",
    "[ fig : f5 ] ) .    in that case , the negative vortices remain in the condensate , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : f7 ] .",
    "we find that , after applying the recent method , the new anti - vortices interact with the existing positive vortices and contribute to the formation of turbulence , see fig .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] .    in two separate cases ,",
    "we track the number of vortices and anti - vortices by maintaining or discontinuing the trap rotation .",
    "if we continue to use @xmath128 or 0.85 after the suggested method , the anti - vortices move out to the edge of the condensate , and new vortices come in until the vortices settle into an ordered vortex array .",
    "the corresponding total number , @xmath54 , positive , @xmath136 , and negative , @xmath137 , numbers of vortices are shown in fig .  [ fig : f6 ] , when the system will relax to the original vortex array .    on the contrary , in the second case ( for @xmath141 )",
    "both vortices and anti - vortices coexist and interact with each other to create turbulence . in that case ,",
    "more negative vortices and more possibilities for annihilations appear , see the suitable plots for @xmath54 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 in fig .",
    "[ fig : f7 ] .",
    "it is instructive to compare this method ( call @xmath142 ) to create turbulence with complex conjugation of the order parameter in a semi - plan with a different one ( call @xmath143 ) @xcite , when the phase was imprinted in upper left quadrant ( @xmath144 and @xmath132 ) and bottom right quadrant ( @xmath145 and @xmath146 ) of the box , or with a method to produce positive and negative vortices by the phase imprinting method ( in upper two quadrants ) , when soliton - like perturbation due to the snake - instability , @xcite decays into vortex - anti vortex pairs @xcite . in that case , the total number of negative ( anti)vortices is not enough to create turbulence .    in case @xmath143 , the direction of vorticity of quantized vortex - line ( in 2d vortex - point ) or the sign of circulation does not change . on the other hand , in case @xmath142 the direction of the condensate does flip .",
    "thus , in @xmath143 , we change the sign of the square root of the density in the madelung transformatio : @xmath147 .",
    "whereas , in a , we change the sign of the phase : @xmath148 .",
    "another important difference between these two methods is that , in the case @xmath143 soliton - like perturbations appear along the @xmath149- and @xmath150-axis .",
    "the solitary wave with local density minimum and a sharp phase gradient of the wave function at the position of the minimum , embedded in a 2d geometry leads to dominant decay mechanism .",
    "thus , the soliton - like perturbations bend and decay into a more stable vortex - anti vortex pairs accompanied by sound waves . in our case @xmath142 , we do not observe soliton - like perturbations !",
    "furthermore , after applying these two methods ( @xmath142 and @xmath143 ) , the shape of the condensate is different , due to the fact that , in @xmath142 we do not have solitary waves .",
    "application of these two methods ( @xmath142 and @xmath143 ) lead to different physical behaviour .",
    "for example , the number of total , positive and negative vortices as a function of time show different behaviour in @xmath142 and in @xmath143 . with the method",
    "@xmath142 more negative vortices appear , which contribute to more annihilations and different total number of vortices as a function of time .",
    "compare , for example these numbers of vortices , for the case when @xmath36 was set to @xmath139 after the application of these methods .",
    "our observation is that , the variation of different numbers of vortices with time vary more slowly in the case @xmath142 .",
    "we conclude that , in case @xmath142 the complex conjugation method reverses the rotation of the vortices in the two halves of the box .",
    "now , the system contains roughly the same number of vortices with different sign and with different energies due to the corresponding different velocity fields .",
    "thus , the imitation of the solid body rotation becomes damaged ( stop of solid body rotation and far field almost cancels ) .",
    "the phase across the whole condensate follows the sign of the vortices , and becomes different in the upper and lower parts of the box . at the centre of the box ,",
    "the phase is zero and by that , no phase kinks happen upon complex conjugation .",
    "thus , no soliton like perturbations form .",
    "very different energies appear and contribute to difficulty in experimental utilization .",
    "we do not know a way to realize this method experimentally .",
    "our study about a more global properties of the phase across the whole condensate shows that , this new method of complex conjugation change the rotation of the vortices in the upper half part of the box . on the other hand , with the phase imprinting method the system try to smooth out the change caused by generation of a discontinuity in the phase in the form of solitary and sound waves",
