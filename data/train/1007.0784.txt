    "the original formulation of the stellar population concept ( @xcite@xcite ) was driven by the realization that the ages and metallicities of galactic stars were related to their kinematics . while baade s identification of the young , metal - rich disk stars as pop i , and the old , metal - poor halo stars as pop ii was a crucial starting point , observations in the last half century have identified both old and metal - rich stellar populations associated with the inner parts of spheroids ( e.g. , @xcite@xcite ; @xcite@xcite ) and young and metal - poor stellar populations associated with low - luminosity star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite@xcite ; @xcite@xcite ) and with the outer parts of luminous disks ( e.g. , @xcite@xcite ; @xcite@xcite ; @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "understanding young , metal - poor stellar populations is an essential task in modern astrophysics , both because it allows us a fuller understanding of star formation and stellar evolution as a function of metallicity , and because it offers us potential insights into the nature of star formation in the early , low - metallicity universe .",
    "our understanding of stellar populations has received an enormous boost from our ability to obtain arcsecond ( or better ) resolution images in the ultraviolet ( uv ) and near infrared ( nir ) . in the nir ,",
    "the last decade has shown the complimentary power of large ground - based surveys ( @xcite@xcite ; @xcite@xcite ) and higher - resolution _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) near infrared camera and multiobject spectrograph ( nicmos ) data . in the uv",
    ", we are now seeing the benefits of combining insights from the large , but moderate - resolution , galex ( @xcite@xcite ) database with high - resolution imaging from hst ( e.g. , @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "imaging at hst resolution provides the opportunity to study resolved stellar populations out to distances of @xmath110 mpc . broad wavelength coverage ( uv through nir ) allows us to investigate the full history of star formation in nearby galaxies .",
    "ngc 1311 is a very nearby ( @xmath0 mpc ) , but little - studied late - type ( sbm ) galaxy .",
    "@xcite(@xcite ) identify it as a member of the 14@xmath514 association , a loose group dominated by the luminous spiral ngc 1313 .",
    "table 1 summarizes the basic properties of the system .",
    "ngc 1311 was a target in two broad - band hst snapshot surveys ( go programs 9124 and 9824 ; @xcite@xcite , @xcite@xcite , @xcite@xcite , and  2 below ) . as a result ,",
    "a set of broad - band images spanning a wide wavelength interval ( 0.31.6@xmath6 m ) at sub - arcsecond resolution now exists for this galaxy . as ngc 1311 is quite nearby , its bright star clusters and luminous individual stars are detected as discrete sources .",
    "we can thus probe the spatially resolved star - formation history of ngc 1311 by studying the broad - band spectral energy distributions of its star clusters , its individual stars , and its unresolved light .",
    "our results for the star clusters are presented in @xcite(@xcite ) .",
    "this paper is concerned with the individual luminous stars .",
    "we shall address the unresolved light in a future publication .    in  2",
    "we briefly summarize the hst observational data .",
    "we present the observed properties of the luminous stars in  3 , and our analysis of these observations in  4 .",
    "we summarize our conclusions , and discuss issues for further research in  5 .",
    "the data for this study are a set of uv , optical and nir images obtained with the wide - field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) and nicmos on board hst .",
    "we have wfpc2 images taken through the f300w , f606w and f814w filters , and a nicmos image taken with the nic3 camera through the f160w filter .",
    "a summary of the observations is given in table 2 .",
    "the f300w image was obtained as part of the hst program go-9124 `` mid - uv snapshot survey of nearby irregulars : galaxy structure and evolution benchmark '' ( r.  windhorst pi ) . for this program ,",

    "we then extracted stellar photometry using the version of daophot ( @xcite@xcite ) embedded in the xvista image analysis package ( @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "for the nicmos photometry , we had to determine the aperture correction manually by measuring the asymptotic count rates for two bright , isolated stars in the observed nic3 image mosaic .",

    "we conducted a series of artificial star tests on our images to determine both the completeness and accuracy of our photometry . for the wfpc2 images",

    "the artificial star tests have offsets that are statistically equivalent to zero , and dispersions of 0.1 to 0.2 mag .",
    "figure 4 shows a suite of color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for the resolved stellar populations of ngc 1311 .",
    "the long - dashed lines show the 50% completeness levels for the relevant bands .",
    "the star clusters studied by @xcite(@xcite ) are not plotted .",

    "inspection of fig .",
    "4 allows us to make several qualitative statements about the resolved stellar populations .",
    "first , the blue - plume stars appear to be a mix of hot main - sequence ( ms ) stars and post - main sequence blue supergiants ( bsgs ) , based on where they lie in fig .",
    "second , only the turn - off stars of the hot main - sequence are bright enough in @xmath16 to be unambiguously detected",
    ". the main - sequence stars are bluer on average in @xmath18 than the bsgs ( see fig .",
    "we use this to refine our classification of blue - plume stars as either bsgs ( more luminous and redder than the diagonal line in fig .",
    "4b ) or ms stars ( less luminous and bluer than this line ) .",
    "third , the red - plume stars are red supergiants ( rsgs ) .",
    "they are nearly all undetected in @xmath14 , but show a clear vertical plume structure in fig .",
    "4d . in fig .",
    "4bcd , the bsgs are circled and the rsgs are crossed .",
    "we note that the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) of an old stellar population is at an absolute magnitude of @xmath24 , which corresponds to an apparent magnitude of @xmath25 for ngc 1311 .",
    "this is much fainter than the magnitudes of the red - plume stars in fig .",
    "we show a selection of color - color diagrams in figure 5 , chosen to show both the bsgs and rsgs . in all cases ,",
    "the bsgs are well isolated from the other detections , and the rsgs are mixed with red stars from neither plume .",
    "these are the faint red stars in fig .  4d , and appear to be evolved stars from populations older than the bright rsg stars . as we have data in a somewhat unusual set of filters ( even for hst observations",
    ", it seems prudent to compare our data to stellar population models before attempting any more detailed interpretation .",
    "we compare our stellar photometry to isochrones derived from the models of @xcite(@xcite ) . in order to plot the isochrones with the photometry",
    ", we adopt the distance estimate for ngc 1311 of @xcite(@xcite ) , who quote @xmath26 mpc based on the magnitude of the tip of the red giant branch .",
    "there appear to be no metallicity measurements of ngc 1311 in the literature , although @xcite(@xcite ) report [ ] / h@xmath27 , consistent with a moderately low metallicity .",
    "for the adopted distance , we find that the isochrones with @xmath28 provide the best fit to the stellar photometry .",
    "the more metal - poor isochrones have main sequences that are substantially bluer than observed in all available colors .",
    "the isochrones more metal - rich than @xmath29 do not predict stars luminous enough in the uv or blue enough in colors including f300w compared to the data . while crowding and/or binarity could artificially inflate the brightness of some fraction of our stars ,",
    "our artificial star tests indicate that this is not a significant problem at the bright end of our photometry .",
    "we adopt a metallicity of @xmath28 below .    in figures 6&7",
    ", we show the suite of cmds and color - color diagrams from figs .",
    "4&5 , with the @xcite(@xcite ) @xmath28 isochrones overlayed .",
    "the most luminous stars in ngc 1311 have absolute visual magnitudes of about @xmath30 .",
    "based on the isochrone comparison , the cmds show a mix of young ( @xmath3110 myr old ) ms stars , and supergiants with ages ranging from @xmath110 myr up to @xmath11 gyr .",
    "there is some evidence of a small population of stars younger than 10 myr ( see fig .",
    "the isochrones are broadly consistent with the stellar distribution in the color - color diagrams , with a few exceptions .",
    "there are stars , including a few of the bsgs , that appear anomolously red in colors involving @xmath17 .",
    "inspection of the images shows that the stars in question typically have faint companions visible in the f606w and f814w images . at the poorer sampling of the f160w image",
    ", these companions are blended with the brighter stars .",
    "if the companion stars are red , this will create exactly the offset we observe in the color - color plots .",
    "there are a few stars , not selected as supergiants , that have colors that are very red in colors involving f606w and redder filters .",
    "these stars are too faint in @xmath15 , given their magnitudes in @xmath16 and @xmath17 , to match the isochrone models .",
    "we speculate that these stars may be dust enshrouded asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "there is also the possibility that a few objects are unresolved background extremely red objects ( e.g. , @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the isochrone matching reinforces the qualitative impressions from the cmds and color - color plots .",
    "the blue - plume stars are a mix of hot ms stars with ages of @xmath3110 myr and bsgs with ages from @xmath110 up to @xmath140 myr .",
    "the red - plume stars are red supergiants with ages from @xmath110 up to @xmath1100 myr .",
    "the hot main sequence stars are generally well - matched by the same 10 myr isochrone that describes the youngest of the bsgs .",
    "the distribution of ms and bsg stars in fig .",
    "6abc , as well as the @xmath32 emission reported by @xcite , are evidence for star formation in the last @xmath110 myr , but at a rate much lower than 10 myr ago .",
    "we thus see evidence for a burst of star formation about 10 myr ago superposed on what had been lower - level , but ongoing star formation over ( at least ) the previous 100 myr or so .",
    "the use of the ratio of blue to red supergiants ( b / r ratio hereafter ) as an astrophysical diagnostic of stellar populations was first suggested by @xcite(@xcite ) .",
    "the b / r ratio turns out to depend on ( at least ) the metallicity and age of a stellar population .",
    "@xcite(@xcite ) and @xcite(@xcite ) provide recent work on the relevant theory , while @xcite(@xcite ) and @xcite(@xcite ) present recent observational results in the context of nearby low - luminosity star - forming galaxies .    the boxes in fig .",
    "4a enclose 280 blue - plume and 190 red - plume stars ( 295 and 200 , after correcting for incompleteness ) .",
    "however , as noted in  3.2 , not all the blue - plume stars identified in fig .",
    "4a are bsgs .",
    "also , as pointed out by @xcite(@xcite ) , the blue and red supergiant plumes in the cmds of nearby galaxies will , in general , be due to stars of a range of ages .",
    "as , even for a fixed metallicity , the b / r ratio is a function of age , some care is required to choose fair samples of stars to evaluate the b / r ratio .",
    "we have small samples to work with , so we choose to define three age - based samples , using the isochrones in fig .",
    "6a , with rough ages of 10 myr , 18 myr and 32 myr .",
    "it is well known that models of rsgs do not produce stars as red as are observed ( see @xcite@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "thus we include , as rsgs of a given age , those stars that lie to the red of the isochrone red loops at a given luminosity . in table 6",
    "we show the resulting age - based samples of bsgs and rsgs , and the b / r ratios for these samples .",
    "the quoted uncertainties in table 6 are from poisson statistics . at a given age",
    ", we have somewhat smaller b / r ratios than @xcite(@xcite ) found for sextans a. this is consistent with a higher metallicity for ngc 1311 than for sextans a. the sextans a metallicity , from both  region spectroscopy ( @xcite@xcite ) and cmd fitting ( @xcite@xcite ) , is @xmath33 , compared to our adopted metallicity for ngc 1311 of @xmath34 .",
    "this conclusion is reinforced by the [ ] / h@xmath35 ratios of the two galaxies reported by @xcite .",
    "in addition to the bsg and rsg samples selected above , we define a sample of hot main sequence ( ms ) stars by taking all stars fainter than @xmath36 mag , and blueward of a line extending from ( @xmath372.6 , 20.7 ) to ( 0 , 22.8 ) in fig .",
    "we show the distribution of all three samples ( ms , bsg , rsg ) on the f300w wf3@xmath5wf4 image in figure 8 .",
    "we note that there are a handful of sources that are not assigned to any of the three groups .",
    "the brightest of these are the star clusters discussed in @xcite .",
    "the fainter sources are only detected in @xmath14 .",
    "these are likely to be ms stars , but as we do not have colors for them , we do not classify them as such .",
    "there are two regions with strong concentrations of ms and bsg stars .",
    "the boxes in fig .",
    "1a enclose these two regions . in figure 9",
    ", we show cmds of the stars in the boxes and in the rest of the galaxy .",
    "nearly half the recent star formation in ngc 1311 has occured in these two small regions , with the remainder broadly distributed throughout the system .",
    "the total area of the two regions is about 0.15 kpc@xmath38 for our adopted distance , or about 2% of the surface area of ngc 1311 .",
    "these regions are also the locations of the strong h@xmath35 emission shown in @xcite .",
    "the regions of enhanced recent star formation are about 10@xmath39 across .",
    "this corresponds to roughly 200 pc for our adopted distance .",
    "velocity - dispersion measurements in late - type galaxies , for either stars or gas , are sparse but have characteristic values of about 10 to 20 km  s@xmath40 ( e.g. , @xcite@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if we assume that the velocity dispersion of the stars in the concentrations is similar to this , the stars will travel roughly 100 to 200 pc in 10 myr .",
    "thus the sizes of the concentrations of young stars are consistent with the ages implied by the cmds .",
    "we can also compare these regions to galactic ob associations .",
    "ob associations are unbound groups of young stars that appear to be dispersing with internal velocity disperions of @xmath415 km  s@xmath40 ( e.g. , @xcite@xcite ; @xcite@xcite ; @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "this gives a slightly longer lifetime , but one that is still in range of 10s of myr .",
    "the distribution of star cluster ages in ngc 1311 is consistent with a bursting mode of cluster formation , with active episodes of age @xmath110 myr , @xmath1100 myr and @xmath421 gyr ( @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the resolved stars tell us a complimentary , but different story : they do not show any compelling evidence for substantial periods of quiescence in the last @xmath1100 myr .",
    "our cmds show a clear population of stars with ages @xmath110 myr .",
    "these are the ms and bsg stars seen in all panels of fig .",
    "there is evidence of low - level on - going star formation over the last 10 myr ( see fig .",
    "the distribution of bsgs and rsgs in the cmds tell us that there was on - going star formation in ngc 1311 from @xmath110 myr ago back to at least @xmath1100 myr ago . although we are mainly concerned with the young stellar populations , we note that fig .",
    "6d and the work of @xcite argue that star formation occured in a more or less steady fashion back to ages of at least @xmath11 gyr .",
    "we can make a somewhat more quantitative assessment of the recent star formation history from the luminosity function ( lf ) of the core helium burning stars , as was first pointed out by @xcite . in figure 10",
    ", we show the bsg differential lfs of the bsg and rsg stars , with age points from the models of @xcite . to convert the lfs into a star formation history we need to specify an initial mass function ( imf ) and a stellar evolution model .",
    "we use the salpeter imf @xcite and the padua stellar evolution models ( @xcite@xcite ) , and apply them following the precepts of @xcite .",
    "figure 11 shows the resulting star formation history in the age range 1040 myr from the bsgs .",
    "the error bars in fig .",
    "11 represent statistical uncertainties from the star - counts only .",
    "there are additional systematic uncertainties due to the adopted imf and stellar evolution model",
    ". these will affect the absolute normalization of the star formation history , but should not substantially affect either its shape or its timescale .",
    "the most luminous bsgs have ages of @xmath110 myr . at ages above @xmath140 myr",
    ", it becomes impossible to isolate the bsgs on the cmds . over the time period we can address , the rate of star formation appears to have been rising steadily , ending in a strong enhancement @xmath110 myr ago that corresponds to the most recent epoch of cluster formation .",
    "there are no bsgs more luminous than @xmath43 .",
    "this indicates that star formation did not continue at the rate seen @xmath110 myr ago . in principle",
    ", this is quantifiable by studying the ms lf .",
    "the upper ms stars are most easily isolated in the @xmath14 vs.  ( @xmath44 cmd ( see figs .  4b , 6b ) .",
    "the 50% completeness limit is at @xmath45 mag , corresponding to an absolute magnitude of @xmath46 .",
    "this means our data only probe the upper @xmath11 magnitude of the ms lf .",
    "we applied the iterative technique of @xcite to the completeness - corrected ms lf of ngc 1311 , again assuming a salpeter imf and the padua models .",
    "the result is that the upper ms stars provide evidence for star formation from 2 to 2.5 myr ago .",
    "the absolute star formation rate has large statistical uncertainty due to the small number of stars and the large completeness corrections .",
    "but there has clearly been residual ongoing star formation in ngc 1311 since the enhancement in star formation @xmath110 myr ago .",
    "we can extend the star formation history back to @xmath1100 myr by taking advantage of the rsgs .",
    "we caution the reader that theoretical modelling of the evolution of rsgs is on a less firm footing than that of bsgs ( @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "our resulting star formation history will therefore be subject to additional systematic uncertainty for ages larger than 40 myr .",
    "however , we procede , again using a salpeter imf and the padua models .",
    "the resulting star formation history is shown in logarithmic form in figure 12 . over the last @xmath1100 myr",
    ", the star formation rate in ngc 1311 appears to have been gradually increasing , peaking with the enhancement @xmath110 myr ago .",
    "we see no evidence for any gap in star formation over the last @xmath1100 myr .",
    "these data are more consistent with a star formation history described as gasping or breathing ( e.g. , @xcite@xcite ; @xcite@xcite ; @xcite@xcite ) than bursting .    in @xcite",
    "we identified a small population of star clusters in ngc 1311 .",
    "eight of these clusters have sufficient multiwavelength photometry to use for age estimation .",
    "these ages break into three groups .",
    "two clusters have ages of @xmath3110 myr .",
    "these clusters would appear to be associated with the enhanced episode of star formation @xmath110 myr ago that is revealed by the bsgs ( see fig .",
    "we note that the total mass in stars formed in the 10 myr enhancement is about an order of magnitude larger than the mass estimated by @xcite for the two young clusters ,    there are no clusters with ages in the interval from 10 to 50 myr .",
    "the bsgs show that there was low - level on - going star formation throughout this interval , but no bound clusters survive from it . as we note in  4.2 ,",
    "the bsgs are concentrated in two regions with properties similar to galactic ob associations .",
    "that is , the stars in that age range are spatially clumped , but they do not inhabit gravitationally bound clusters .",
    "four clusters have ages between 50 myr and 130 myr . the rsgs show evidence for a gradually increasing star formation rate toward the younger / more recent part of this range .",
    "how this relates to the cluster formation in this epoch may be discernable by a more extensive analysis of the hst advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) data than was reported by @xcite .",
    "however , we note that the total mass in intermediate - age clusters ( @xcite@xcite ) is roughly equal to the total mass in intermediate - age field stars based on the rsg lf .",
    "thus the star formation of @xmath1100 myr ago was efficient at producing clusters dense enough to remain bound over @xmath1100 myr timescales , whereas the 10 myr enhancement appears to have produced mainly unbound stellar associations",
    ".      fits to isochrones indicate a metallicity of @xmath2 ( @xmath47 \\approx   -0.7 $ ] ) , consistent with [ ] /h@xmath35 = 0.08 ( @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "given its absolute magnitude ( see table 1 ) , this places ngc 1311 in the midst of the magnitude - metallicity relation for late - type dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "we show this in figure 13 , where we plot b - band absolute magnitudes and nebular oxygen abudances for star forming dwarf galaxies from a number of recent studies ( @xcite@xcite ; @xcite@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite@xcite ) . to place ngc 1311 on the figure , we convert the linear metallicity ( @xmath34 ) to logarithmic notation , assuming @xmath48 .",

    "we have analysed stellar photometry from hst images of this galaxy covering a wavelength range from 0.31.6@xmath6 m .",
    "we detect hot ms stars in the uv and optical images , providing strong evidence for star formation as recently as @xmath12 myr ago .",
    "we also detect bsg and rsg stars that provide evidence of ongoing star formation over the last @xmath1100 myr .",
    "our nir data reveal populations of stars as old as @xmath421 gyr , in agreement with the work of @xcite .",
    "the field stars of ngc 1311 show a less burst - like age distribution than do the star clusters in ngc 1311 ( @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "about half of the recent star formation , as traced by the ms and bsg stars , is confined to two regions about 200 pc across in the bright central part of the system . assuming a velocity dispersion for the stars that is typical of galactic ob associations , the crossing time is on the order of the age of 10 myr determined from the cmds .",
    "the metallicity of @xmath2 that follows from the isochrone fits and the b / r ratio places ngc 1311 in the midst of the metallicity - luminosity relation for low - luminosity late - type galaxies .",
    "our results for ngc 1311 are consistent with those found for the general population of late - type , low - luminosity galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite@xcite ; @xcite@xcite ; @xcite@xcite ; @xcite@xcite ; @xcite@xcite ; @xcite@xcite ; @xcite@xcite ; @xcite@xcite ; @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the arising consensus is that such galaxies form stars over their entire histories .",
    "the rate of star formation may change with time , but only rarely does it cease entirely .",
    "the long - term star forming histories of low - luminosity galaxies are best studied with deep long - wavelength optical ( @xmath52 ) or nir ( @xmath53 ) images .",
    "our uv and optical data allow us to explore the star forming history of ngc 1311 over the last @xmath1100 myr .",
    "our next step is a study of the unresolved light of ngc 1311 with our combined wfpc2/nicmos hst data .",
    "as we have observations in four wavelengths from 3000  to 1.6@xmath54 , we will sample stellar populations from ages of @xmath110 myr to @xmath4210 gyr .",
    "nearby star - forming galaxies are known to have unresolved uv light ( e.g. , @xcite@xcite ) at hst resolution .",
    "the stellar photometry we present in this paper provides information on individual ms stars as late as early b - type stars .",
    "late b - type and a - type stars will contribute significant diffuse uv light that traces the distribution of stars of @xmath1100 myr ages .",
    "the ancient stellar populations , dominating the nir light , appear ubiquitous even in very late - type galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite@xcite ; @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the combination of our cluster and stellar photometry with an analysis of the unresolved light should give us a clearer picture of the star formation history in this system , and a fuller understanding of the process of star formation in low - luminosity late - type galaxies in general .",
