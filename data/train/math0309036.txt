    "the existence of such an action yields information about the unitary representation theory of the group , and in particular the baum - connes conjecture is known to hold for a - t - menable groups , see @xcite .    in @xcite the second author , together with martin roller , described a method to construct isometric actions on hilbert space by adapting a technique of sageev @xcite .",
    "the construction can be interpreted as giving a recipe for embedding a cat(0 ) cube complex in the unit cube in a hilbert space so that the group of cellular isometries of the cube complex acts by affine isometries on the hilbert space .",

    "the notion of a space with walls is generalized to that of a measured wall space .",
    "the relationship between spaces with walls and measured wall spaces is roughly analogous to the relationship between a classical tree and an @xmath0-tree , and in @xcite , cherix , martin and valette showed that a finitely generated group admits a proper action on a measured wall space if and only if it is a - t - menable .",
    "it is natural to ask whether or not groups which act properly on measured wall spaces must also admit proper actions on spaces with walls .",

    "that the link is simplicial is straightforward : a @xmath1-simplex in the link corresponds to a @xmath131-corner , and the intersection of two corners is again a corner ( of smaller dimension ) . that the link of a vertex is a flag complex is also more or less by construction , as the vertices of the 1-skeleton of a @xmath132-dimensional simplex in the link of a vertex @xmath61 are labeled by hyperplanes @xmath93 pairwise sharing a square , i.e. pairwise crossing",

    "finally , if the action of @xmath2 on @xmath5 is proper , then so is the action of @xmath2 on the cube complex @xmath31 , precisely because the pseudo - metric given by the wall structure corresponds to the combinatorial distance given by the @xmath97-skeleton of @xmath31 ( see remark [ realization ] ) . notice that we did nt say anything about cocompactness , and indeed we shall see in the next section ( example  [ cocnoncoc ] ) that sometimes a cocompact action on a wall space yields a non - cocompact action on the corresponding cube complex .",

    "the intersection number for this space with walls is 3 , and the 3-cubes in the corresponding cube complex are given by the triple intersections of mirrors .",
    "the squares which are not faces of a 3-cube correspond to double points in the tessellation ( i.e. intersections of two single walls ) .",
