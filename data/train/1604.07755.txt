    "the study of monotonicity and rigidity of solutions to semilinear elliptic equations of fractional order in the whole space @xmath0 or in smooth bounded sets @xmath1 has attracted considerable attention in the last years , see e.g. @xcite . in striking contrast ,",

    "the main purpose of this paper is the study of the qualitative properties of bounded solutions to @xmath3 where  @xmath1 is assumed to be _ the epigraph of a continuous function @xmath4 _ , i.e. we suppose that @xmath5 notice that the half - space @xmath6 falls within this definition with @xmath7 .    in , @xmath8 with @xmath9 denotes the fractional laplacian , which can be defined as the operator acting on sufficiently smooth functions as @xmath10 where  @xmath11 is a normalizing constant ( which plays no major role in the present paper and which will be often omitted for simplicity ) , and @xmath12 stays for  principal value \"",
    ".    we will consider different assumptions on @xmath13 , obtaining different monotonicity and rigidity properties accordingly .",
    "the nonlinearity  @xmath14 in   belongs to a reasonably wide class of functions , including for instance those of bistable - type ( a precise definition will follow shortly ) . under these assumptions ,",
    "the main results of this paper are :    * boundary regularity , monotonicity and further qualitative properties for solutions to   in globally lipschitz epigraphs ; * monotonicity for solutions to   in coercive epigraphs ; * @xmath15-dimensional symmetry in the half - space ; * rigidity for overdetermined problems in epigraphs that are sufficiently  flat at infinity \" .",
    "similar results in the classical case  @xmath16 were obtained in the seminal paper  @xcite . here",
    ", dealing with a nonlocal framework , a careful analysis is needed to overcome the lack of explicit barriers and several ad - hoc arguments will be exploited to replace the study of the point - wise behavior of the solution with a global study of the geometry of the problem .    as additional statements , we also derive a very general maximum principle ( tailor - made for non - decaying solutions in possibly unbounded domains ) , a general version of the sliding method for the fractional laplacian , and a boundary regularity result for solutions of fractional boundary value problems in sets satisfying an exterior cone condition .    before proceeding with the statement of our results , we clarify that with the terminology _ solution _ in this paper we always mean _ classical solution_.    as a matter of fact , without extra effort , the same results would apply to bounded _ viscosity solutions _ of  : indeed , since we will assume that the nonlinearity  @xmath14 is locally lipschitz continuous , the regularity theory for viscosity solutions ( developed in @xcite ) implies that viscosity and classical solutions coincide in our setting ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 2.3 ) for a detailed explanation ) .",
    "in addition , we mention that  _ distributional ( i.e. very weak ) solutions _ or _ weak solutions _ ( as defined e.g. in @xcite ) could be considered as well with minor changes .    for the reader s convenience , we will recall the definition of classical and viscosity solution at the end of the introduction .    in the next subsections , we describe in details the results obtained . in all the forthcoming statements ,",
    "the fractional parameter @xmath17 will always be a fixed value in the interval @xmath18 .",

    ", we may think at @xmath32 , which yields the fractional allen - cahn equation , that is a widely studied model in phase transitions in media with long - range particle interactions , see e.g.  @xcite .",

    "* if @xmath43 is such that @xmath44 then @xmath45 in particular , @xmath35 is monotone increasing in @xmath46 .",
    "we stress that , since @xmath1 is merely a lipschitz set and the exterior sphere condition is not necessarily satisfied along @xmath47 , the hlder continuity of the solution does not follow by previous contributions ( see subsection [ au45678iuhauaj13 ] for more details ) .",
    "both the exponents @xmath48 and @xmath41 appearing in the theorem are determined by the choice of @xmath13 . to be more precise , we note that a globally lipschitz epigraph satisfy both a uniform exterior cone condition with angle @xmath49 and a uniform interior cone condition with angle @xmath50 ( see subsection [ au45678iuhauaj13 ] for a precise definition of the exterior cone condition ) ; then , as it will be clear from the proofs , the exponent @xmath41 depends on @xmath49 , while the index @xmath48 depends on @xmath50 .",

    "this marks a relevant difference with the local setting  @xmath16 , since in case @xmath59 non - negative solutions of local equations are not necessarily monotone , and only partial results are available ( we refer the interested reader to @xcite ) .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : main 1 ] is given in section [ sec : thm 1 ] , and relies on some classical ideas of  @xcite  nevertheless , all the intermediate steps present several substantial difficulties of purely nonlocal nature . as a matter of fact , in @xcite the authors often construct more or less explicit local barriers , and exploit local properties of functions whose laplacian has a strict sign . on the other hand ,",
    "the construction of a barrier function is much harder when dealing with integro - differential operators , since such barrier has to be defined in the all space @xmath0 , and has to satisfy a boundary condition on the complement of a certain set @xmath60 ( and not only on @xmath61 ) .",
    "moreover , local properties of functions can not be inferred by the only knowledge of the fractional laplacian in some neighbourhood and any modification of the function `` far away '' affects the values of its fractional laplacian at a point .",
