    "the search for a mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking , and in particular for a standard model ( sm ) higgs boson boson has been a major goal of high energy physics for many years , and is a central part of fermilab s tevatron program . both cdf and",
    "have recently reported new searches for the sm higgs boson that combined different production and decay modes  @xcite that allow to gain sensitivity compared to the previous tevatron combination presented in december 2007  @xcite . in this note",
    ", we combine the most recent results of all such searches in  collisions at  . the searches for a sm higgs boson produced in association with vector bosons ( ,  or ) or through gluon - gluon fusion ( ) or vector boson fusion ( vbf ) , in data corresponding to integrated luminosities ranging from 1.0 - 2.4  at cdf and 1.1 - 2.3  at d .",
    "in this combination we add for the first time searches for higgs bosons decaying to two photons or two tau leptons .    to simplify their combination ,",
    "the searches are separated into twenty nine mutually exclusive final states ( thirteen for cdf , sixteen for d , see table  [ tab : cdfacc ] and  [ tab : dzacc ] ) referred to as `` analyses '' in this note .",
    "selection procedures for each analysis are detailed in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite , and are briefly described below .    compared to the results that we presented at the moriond 08 conference  @xcite , we adopt here a simpler approach in the treatment of the shape systematics uncertainties when deriving the final limits , treating them as gaussian errors , as it is done for the other systematics uncertainties , instead of truncating them at @xmath7 .",
    "this treatment is now consistent between the two limit setting methodologies described below .",
    "this change has essentially no effect on the expected limits and only affects the observed limits at low masses .",
    "event selections are similar for the corresponding cdf and d  analyses . for the case of , an isolated lepton ( electron or muon ) and two jets are required , with one or more @xmath8-tagged jet , i.e. identified as originating from a @xmath8-quark .",
    "selected events must also display a significant imbalance in transverse momentum ( referred to as missing transverse energy or ) .",
    "events with more than one isolated lepton are vetoed .",
    "for the d  analyses , two non - overlapping @xmath8-tagged samples are defined , one being a single `` tight '' @xmath8-tag ( st ) sample , and the other a double `` loose '' @xmath8-tag ( dt ) sample .",
    "the tight and loose @xmath8-tagging criteria are defined with respect to the mis - identification rate that the @xmath8-tagging algorithm yields for light quark or gluon jets ( `` mistag rate '' ) typically @xmath9 or @xmath10 , respectively . for the cdf  analyses , an analysis based on a sample with two tight b - tags ( tdt )",
    "is combined with an analysis based on a non - overlapping sample requiring one tight b - tag and one loose b - tag ( ldt ) . for this combination additional channels",
    "have been added : a single @xmath8-tag channel ( stc ) with a dedicated neural network rejection of @xmath11-quark tagging , and three additional channels with similar @xmath8-tagging requirement , but with electrons detected in more forward directions than in the standard channels . in the  analyses , both cdf and d",
    "use neural - network ( nn ) discriminants as the final variables for setting limits .",
    "the networks are optimized to discriminate signal from background at each value of the higgs boson mass ( the `` test mass '' ) under study .    for the  analyses ,",
    "the selection is similar to the @xmath12 selection , except all events with isolated leptons are vetoed and stronger multijet background suppression techniques are applied .",
    "the cdf analysis uses two non - overlapping samples of events ( tdt and ldt as for @xmath12 ) while duses a sample of events having one tight @xmath8-tag jet and one loose @xmath8-tag jet . as there is a sizable fraction of  signal",
    "in which the lepton is undetected , that is selected in the  samples , the d  analysis includes this fraction as a separate search , referred to as .",
    "cdf includes it as this fraction is included as part of the acceptance of the  search .",
    "compared to the previous combination , cdf is now also using a neural - network discriminant as final variable , while d  has doubled the analyzed statistics and uses now boosted decision trees instead of neural networks as advanced analysis technique .",
    "the  analyses require two isolated leptons and at least two jets .",
    "they use non - overlapping samples of events with one tight @xmath8-tag and two loose @xmath8-tags . for the d  analysis",
    "a neural - network discriminant is the final variable for setting limits , while cdf uses the output of a 2-dimensional neural - network .",
    "these analyses have not been updated compared to the previous combination .    for the  analyses , a large  and two opposite - signed , isolated leptons ( any combination of electrons or muons )",
    "are selected , defining three final states ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 ) for d .",
    "cdf separates the  events in two non - overlapping samples , one having a low signal / bacgkround ( s / b ) ratio , the other having a higher one .",
    "the presence of neutrinos in the final state prevents reconstruction of the higgs boson mass .",
    "the final discriminants are neural - network outputs including likelihoods constructed from matrix - element probabilities as input to the neural network , for both cdf and d .",
    "all analyses in this channel have been updated with more data and analysis improvements .",
    "the cdf experiment contributes also a new analysis searching for higgs bosons decaying to a tau lepton pair , in three separate production channel with 2 fb@xmath16 of data : direct @xmath17 production , associated @xmath12 or @xmath18 production , or vector boson production with @xmath0 and forward jets in the final state . in this analysis ,",
    "the final variable for setting limits is a combination of several neural - network discriminants .",
    "the d  experiment contributes three  analyses , where the associated @xmath19 boson and the @xmath19 boson from the higgs boson decay which has the same charge are required to decay leptonically , thereby defining three like - sign dilepton final states ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 ) containing all decays of the third @xmath19 boson . in this analysis , which has not been updated for this combination ,",
    "the final variable is a likelihood discriminant formed from several topological variables .",
    "d  also contributes a new analysis searching for direct higgs boson production decaying to a photon pair in 2.3 fb@xmath16 of data . in this analysis ,",
    "the final variable is the invariant mass of the two photons system .",
    "all higgs boson signals are simulated using pythia  @xcite , and cteq5l or cteq6l  @xcite leading - order ( lo ) parton distribution functions .",
    "the signal cross sections are normalized to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) calculations  @xcite , and branching ratios from hdecay  @xcite . for both cdf and d , events from multijet ( instrumental ) backgrounds ( `` qcd production '' )",
    "are measured in data with different methods , in orthogonal samples . for cdf ,",
    "backgrounds from other sm processes were generated using pythia , alpgen  @xcite , mc@nlo  @xcite and herwig  @xcite programs .",
    "for d , these backgrounds were generated using pythia , alpgen , and comphep  @xcite , with pythia providing parton - showering and hadronization for all the generators .",
    "background processes were normalized using either experimental data or next - to - leading order calculations from mcfm  @xcite .",
    "integrated luminosities , and references to the collaborations public documentation for each analysis are given in table  [ tab : cdfacc ] for cdf and in table  [ tab : dzacc ] for d .",
    "the tables include the ranges of higgs boson mass ( @xmath23 ) over which the searches were performed .        observed and expected ( median , for the background - only hypothesis ) 95% c.l .",
    "upper limits on the ratios to the sm cross section , as functions of the higgs boson test mass , for the combined cdf and d  analyses .",
    "the limits are expressed as a multiple of the sm prediction for test masses for which both experiments have performed dedicated searches in different channels .",
