    "the theorem announced in the abstract , which we prove as theorem [ phi - iso ] , is part of a larger program that is inspired by the realization , which only recently has come into focus , that fell bundles over groups and , more generally , fell bundles over groupoids , provide a natural setting for a broad range of imprimitivity theorems and equivalence theorems for @xmath3-dynamical systems , especially theorems involving nonabelian duality .",

    "the space of continuous , compactly supported cross sections of @xmath0 , denoted @xmath19 , carries a natural convolution - like product under which it forms a @xmath20-algebra .",
    "a certain completion of this algebra is a @xmath3-algebra , denoted @xmath4 .",
    "one can profitably think of @xmath4 as a generalized crossed product of @xmath9 by @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath1 acts on a @xmath3-algebra @xmath21 via a continuous homomorphism @xmath22 , and if @xmath0 is defined to be @xmath23 , with product defined by the equation @xmath24 , then @xmath0 is a fell bundle over @xmath1 , called the _ semidirect - product bundle _ determined by the action , and the @xmath3-crossed product @xmath25 is isomorphic to the bundle @xmath3-algebra @xmath4 .",
    "this point was made by fell in his first works on the subject @xcite and was one of the reasons he began the theory of these bundles .",

    "coactions were introduced to give a generalization , for non - abelian groups , of the takai - takesaki duality for crossed products by actions of abelian groups on @xmath3-algebras .",
    "subsequently katayama proved a crossed - product duality theorem for coactions , specifically , if @xmath2 is a coaction of a group @xmath1 on a @xmath3-algebra @xmath26 , then there is a dual action @xmath27 of @xmath1 on the crossed product @xmath28 such that the _ reduced _ crossed product @xmath29 is isomorphic to @xmath30 .",

    "the use of the term `` crossed product '' both in the context of group actions and in the context of coactions may seem confusing , initially .",
    "however , in practice , it is easy to distinguish between the two .",
    "raeburn introduced _ full _ coactions , which involve the full group @xmath3-algebra @xmath32 , to take advantage of universal properties . for such coactions , there is always a canonical surjection @xmath33 and the question naturally arose , when is @xmath34 in fact an isomorphism ?",
    "when this is the case , _ full crossed - product duality _ is said to hold , and the coaction @xmath2 is said to be _",
    "maximal_. for example , the dual coaction on a full crossed product by an action is always maximal ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  3.4 ) .    since fell bundle @xmath3-algebras are generalizations of crossed products by actions , it is natural to ask whether there exists a coaction @xmath35 of @xmath1 on @xmath36 , and if so , whether @xmath2 is maximal . in the present paper",
    ", we settle these questions affirmatively .",
    "the existence of a coaction on @xmath4 was briefly presented in @xcite for the case of reduced coactions . in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , the third author showed that when the group @xmath1 is discrete there is in fact a bijective correspondence between fell bundles over @xmath1 and coactions of @xmath1 on @xmath3-algebras .",
    "further , in @xcite the third author and echterhoff observed that given a fell bundle @xmath0 over a discrete group @xmath1 , there is a natural coaction @xmath2 of @xmath1 on @xmath4 and the crossed product @xmath6 is naturally isomorphic to the @xmath3-algebra of a fell bundle @xmath37 over the discrete groupoid @xmath38 obtained by letting @xmath1 act on itself by left translation .",
    "this observation , coupled with the work of the second and fourth authors on the theory of fell bundles over groupoids @xcite ( which , in turn , was inspired , in part , by @xcite ) , was the point of departure for the current project .",
    "indeed , although groupoids do not appear explicitly in the statement of our main theorem , fell bundles over groupoids are crucial in the techniques we develop for the proof .",
    "we rely heavily on @xcite for the theory and basic results concerning fell bundles over groupoids .",
    "in particular , we make free use of the disintegration theorem for fell bundles ( * ? ? ?",

    "section [ product bundles ] addresses some fine points regarding the problem of `` promoting '' a fell bundle over a group to a fell bundle over the product of the group with itself . the first real step in our analysis",
    "is taken in section [ exist ] . there",
    "we prove in proposition [ exists ] that if @xmath0 is a fell bundle over a locally compact group @xmath1 , then there is a natural coaction @xmath2 of @xmath1 on @xmath4 analogous to the dual coaction on a crossed product .",
    "we note in passing that in @xcite , exel and ng prove a result that is similar to our proposition [ exists ]",
    ". however , their setting is somewhat different from ours in that it uses an older and no - longer - used definition of `` full coaction '' that was advanced by raeburn in @xcite .",
    "also , their proof is different in certain important respects .",
    "so , to keep this note self - contained we present full details .",
    "the second substantial step taken in our analysis is theorem [ coaction crossed product isomorphism ] , which asserts that there is a natural isomorphism @xmath39 from the crossed product @xmath40 to the @xmath3-algebra @xmath41 of the fell bundle @xmath37 over the transformation groupoid @xmath38 .",
    "as we mentioned above , this isomorphism theorem was inspired by @xcite .",
    "section [ transformation bundles ] provides the necessary prerequisites for the formulation and proof of theorem [ coaction crossed product isomorphism ] .",
    "the third major step is theorem  [ action crossed product isomorphism ] , which establishes , in the general context of a fell bundle @xmath42 over a groupoid @xmath43 , an isomorphism between the @xmath3-algebra of a semidirect - product bundle @xmath44 ( the theory of which is developed in section  [ semidirect - product bundles ] ) and the crossed product of @xmath45 by a corresponding action of  @xmath1 .",

    "there , we show that the isomorphism @xmath39 established in theorem [ coaction crossed product isomorphism ] is equivariant for the dual action @xmath5 of  @xmath1 on @xmath46 and a natural action of  @xmath1 on @xmath41 . using this ,",
    "@xmath39 is promoted to an isomorphism between the two crossed products .",
    "we then apply the result of section  [ action crossed product ] to this natural action to see that the crossed product can be realized as the @xmath3-algebra of a certain semidirect - product bundle ; this bundle turns out to be isomorphic to one whose @xmath3-algebra is easily recognized as @xmath47 .",
    "finally , we show that these isomorphisms combine to give the canonical surjection  @xmath34 , and this completes our proof of theorem [ phi - iso ] .",
