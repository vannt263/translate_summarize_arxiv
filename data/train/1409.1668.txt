    "@xcite , mgl was generalized to arbitrary binary input - output channels . in ahlswede and korner @xcite , they introduced the concept of the _ gerbator _ for arbitrary discrete memoryless channel to study mgl in alphabets with higher cardinality . in chayat and shamai @xcite ,",

    "the rest of this work is organized as follows . in section [ sec : mgl ] , we introduce the necessary notation and the background . in section [ sec : gmgl ] , we present our main result on the generalized mgl . in section [ sec : app ] , we demonstrate the power of our result by simplifying the discussion in the binary broadcast channel .",
