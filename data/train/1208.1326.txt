    "belief propagation ( bp ) decoders based upon the sum - product algorithm ( spa ) are widely used to decode error - correcting codes that have a sparse graphical representation , including , most notably , low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes .",
    "this paper addresses numerical issues arising in the implementation of spa decoding and several of its variants that have an impact on the occurrence and severity of frequently observed error floors in the decoder performance curves .",
    "( for background on bp and ldpc coding , the reader is referred to @xcite . )    in @xcite , mackay and postol examined _ near codewords _ associated with the error floors that they observed in bp decoding of margulis - type codes over the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel . shortly thereafter",
    ", richardson @xcite wrote a seminal paper on the error floors of ldpc codes in the setting of the awgn channel and the binary symmetric channel , identifying decoder - dependent , error - prone substructures in the tanner graph , dubbed _ trapping sets _",
    ", that were responsible for the observed floors .",
    "later , han and ryan also studied error floors and their properties for ldpc codes used on the awgn channel @xcite . with the exception of @xcite , which used a 5-bit hardware simulation to generate error - rate curves",
    ", it appears that the error floors reported in these prior studies were found with floating - point ( fp ) simulations of the bp decoder .",
    "a quantization scheme , such as fp , imposes a limited range and finite resolution on the values to be represented .",
    "additionally , the use of non - linear functions in a quantized environment may dramatically further limit the domains and/or images of said functions .",
    "this paper addresses these issues of range and resolution of the messages in several spa variants implemented in fp .",
    "recent work has shown that the error floors of variable - regular ldpc codes , such as the margulis code considered by the authors of @xcite , are largely the result of numerical problems associated with the processing of highly certain messages in the bp decoder implementation  @xcite .",
    "this work improves the range of several known spa variants , introduces a new spa variant , and presents simulation results for two variable - regular ldpc codes whose error floors are reduced by orders of magnitude by addressing these numerical range issues .",
    "motivated by these observations , zhang and siegel  @xcite have devised several small - bit - width decoders that substantially lower the observed error floors of several ldpc codes .",
    "these decoders use non - uniform quantization techniques that accept reduced message resolution for highly certain messages for the sake of increased message range .",
    "ldpc codes are defined by the null space of a parity check matrix @xmath0 .",
    "the codewords are the set of column vectors @xmath1 , such that @xmath2 satisfies @xmath3 over a particular field .",
    "a given code can be described by many different @xmath0 matrices .    the @xmath0 matrix over gf(@xmath4 )",
    "may be associated with a bipartite graph @xmath5 , called a _ tanner graph _ , in which the vertex set may be partitioned into two disjoint sets @xmath6 and @xmath7 . the set of variable nodes @xmath6 represent the symbols of the codeword that are sent over the channel and correspond to the columns of the parity - check matrix .",
    "the set of check nodes @xmath7 enforce the parity - check equations represented by the rows of @xmath0 .",
    "each edge @xmath8 of a tanner graph joins a variable node @xmath9 to a check node @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath11th entry of @xmath0 is @xmath12 if @xmath13 and is @xmath14 otherwise .",
    "we are only concerned with codes over the binary field gf(@xmath4 ) . also , we assume binary antipodal signaling over the awgn channel for the purposes of illustration , but the fundamental numerical issues are independent of these assumptions .",
    "after encoding , each binary element of codeword @xmath15 is transmitted over the awgn channel as a binary antipodal symbol @xmath16 .",
    "every received symbol @xmath17 is simply the sum @xmath18 of the transmitted symbol plus independent and identically - distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "gaussian noise of zero - mean and variance @xmath19 .",
    "this yields a channel snr of @xmath20 or @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the rate of the code , @xmath23 is the received energy per information bit for coherent bandpass detection , and @xmath24 is the one - sided power spectral density of the noise .",
    "we next describe the sum - product algorithm ( spa ) that is one of the most widely used forms of bp decoding for ldpc codes . for codes with a cycle - free tanner graph representation ,",
    "spa decoding on such a graph is optimal , in the sense that it is equivalent to symbol - wise , maximum a - posteriori ( map ) decoding .",
    "such codes are generally not attractive @xcite .",
    "although no longer optimal when used to decode ldpc codes whose tanner graph representations have cycles , spa decoding has nevertheless been found to provide near - optimal performance , at least in certain ranges of signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "as is often done , we will first implement our decoder simulation in the log - domain ; this removes the need for normalization and is also closer to the approximations used in hardware implementations . in describing the algorithm",
    ", we use the notation @xmath25 to indicate the set of check nodes adjacent to variable node @xmath26 , and we use @xmath27 to denote all variable nodes adjacent to check node @xmath28 , excluding variable node @xmath26 .    first , the received symbols @xmath17 are converted to log - likelihood ratios ( llrs ) defined by @xmath29 } = \\ln \\frac{{p({r_i}|{t_i } = + 1)}}{{p({r_i}|{t_i } = - 1)}}.\\ ] ] for the awgn channel , this becomes @xmath30 } = 2 r_i / { \\sigma ^2}$ ] .",

    "the iteration counter @xmath33 is then initialized to @xmath12 .    on the first half - iteration of iteration @xmath33 , the message sent from check node @xmath28 to the adjacent variable node @xmath26 is given by @xmath34 } = 2\\ , \\tanh^{-1 } \\biggl [ { \\prod\\limits_{k \\in \\mathcal{n}(j)\\setminus i } { \\tanh \\frac{{\\lambda_{l - 1}^{[k \\to j]}}}{2 } } } \\biggr],\\ ] ] for each edge in the graph . during the second half - iteration ,",

    "otherwise , the iteration counter is incremented by 1 , and the new check - to - variable - node messages are computed using ( [ cnupdate ] ) . upon the completion of the iterations , the decision for symbol @xmath36 , denoted @xmath37}$ ] , is set equal to the sign of the incoming message sum at variable node @xmath26 , that is , @xmath38 } = \\operatorname{sign}\\bigl(\\lambda^{[i ] } + \\sum\\limits_{k \\in \\mathcal{n}(i ) } { \\lambda_{l}^{[i \\leftarrow k]}}\\bigr).\\ ] ] if @xmath39 has no cycles , the message sum is equivalent to @xmath40 , the map decision statistic .",

    "finally , the vertical lines indicate two exact formulations reaching their upper llr limit and their error beginning a linear growth with respect to llr .",
    "fig . [ fig_cnnoise ] also suggests that hybrid spa solutions  that is , switching from a precise formulation to an approximation as llrs grow  may be acceptable .",

    "approximation to msa once a very large llr , say @xmath46 , is first seen . at such a point in decoding ,",
    "the approximation error of the less - complex msa is less than the resolution of the values for most of the messages in the graph .    also , it is simple to push the llr limits beyond that shown in table [ table_summ ] for formulations that already support large llrs . at very large llrs the update rules are largely insensitive to scaling , and",
    "msa is always insensitive to scaling .",
    "so , once we detect an extremely large llr in decoding , say @xmath47 in dp - fp , we may rescale all llrs ( including the llrs from the channel ) substantially to provide additional headroom .",
    "this alleviates the need to consider the qp - fp format for more llr range .",

    "it is approximately proportional to the value represented , with a proportionality constant of @xmath51 .    we can plot the other domains using a simple transformation .",
    "for instance , in the lr domain ( @xmath52 ) of section [ sectlr ] , we find the fp - quantization steps of @xmath53 as a function of @xmath50 are approximately @xmath54 to transform small changes in @xmath53 to llr units we need only multiply by the magnitude of the derivative @xmath55 to produce @xmath56 approximately a constant value . as shown in fig .",
