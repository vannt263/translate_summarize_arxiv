    "the low - temperature magnetic response of sr@xmath8cu@xmath2o@xmath3 is dominated by the cuo@xmath5 chain subsystem , whereas the ladder subsystem is magnetically silent due to a large spin gap .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] , exhibits two pronounced features , a clear maximum at about 75  k and a curie - like divergence at @xmath9 .",
    "the maximum has been attributed to the existence of antiferromagnetically coupled dimers on the chains , which are supposed to host nearly six zhang - rice singlets (  holes \" ) per 10 cu sites .",
    "the @xmath9 divergence was attributed to free cu spins residing somewhere in the crystal structure . in a recent investigation @xcite it could be shown by means of epr measurements that these impurities are located on the chains since they experience the same chemical environment as the cu ions bound in dimers .",
    "taken this into account a quantum statistical simulation  as outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite  was performed in order to treat both dimers and monomers and other possible substructures on a common footing .",
    "the model is similar to a simple born - oppenheimer description where the electronic hamiltonian ( here spin hamiltonian ) depends parametrically on the positions of the classical nuclei ( here hole positions ) .",
    "each configuration @xmath10 of holes and spins defines a hilbert space which is orthogonal to all hilbert spaces arising from different configurations .",
    "the hamilton operator @xmath11 of a certain configuration @xmath10 is of heisenberg type , i.  e. @xmath12 @xmath13 are the respective exchange parameters which depend on the configuration of holes . for the theoretical results",
    "four exchange parameters are used .",
    "the strongest and antiferromagnetic exchange @xmath14  k is across one hole .",
    "the exchange across two holes @xmath15  k is ferromagnetic as is the exchange @xmath16  k of neighboring spins .",
    "we also apply a coupling across one spin which is weaker than @xmath17 and taken to be @xmath18  k. the following statements are robust for reasonable variations of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied for the following calculations .",
    "two very good fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ( lines ) together with the experimental data points ( crosses ) .",
    "the fits yield that it is equally well possible that the chains contain monomers as well as that they contain trimers .",
    "the first case is very similar to the one found using density functional theory calculations @xcite .",
    "t : experimental data ( b parallel to the @xmath22-axis ) are given by crosses .",
    "the results of a complete numerical diagonalization are depicted by a solid curve for @xmath23 and @xmath24 as well as by a dashed curve for @xmath23 and @xmath25.,width=264 ]",
    "for the calcium doped compounds sr@xmath0ca@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 the picture is much more involved . whereas sr@xmath8cu@xmath2o@xmath3 exhibits charge order on the chains due to the combined presence of long range coulomb interaction like in na@xmath26cuo@xmath27 @xcite and commensurate doping level , the ca - doping results in a decreasing stability of charge order @xcite .",
    "in addition , the dimer spin gap is strongly affected by the doping level , and at low temperatures a finite susceptibility , which is not curie - like , is observed @xcite .",
    "this susceptibility increases with the ca content .",
    "figure  [ fig-2 ] shows the temperature dependence of the magnetization for various ca - doped compounds for @xmath28  t.      it is known that application of chemical pressure through ca - doping leads to a hole transfer from the chains to the ladders in sr@xmath0ca@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the estimated maximal reduction of the number of holes on the chains is one hole out of six per formula unit .",
    "in addition , it is usually assumed that the increased presence of holes on the ladders does not significantly reduce the ladder s spin gap .",
    "therefore , the low - temperature low - field magnetic response should still origin from the chain subsystem only .        in the context of the quantum statistical model , eqs .",
    "( [ js-1 - 1])-([js-1 - 3 ] ) , we investigate a huge variety of doping levels numerically .",
    "the number of spins is @xmath30 , or @xmath31 , whereas the number of holes is varied in the range @xmath32 .",
    "figure  [ fig-3 ] shows a small selection of resulting magnetization curves .",
    "a striking feature of all curves  not only those which are shown  is that for @xmath33 the high temperature part at @xmath34  k does not increase with decreasing number of holes . only for hole levels significantly less than 50  % the chains show a magnetization comparable to the experiment .",
    "the discrepancy between experimental and theoretical results has the following consequences .",
    "antiferromagnetic spin chains of finite length ( 50  % holes ) can not account for the observed behavior .",
    "in general , hole levels above 50  % can not produce the observed high - temperature magnetization .",
    "in addition both scenarios can not explain the low - temperature high - field magnetization .",
    "thermal and field induced dynamics of the holes might be a solution .",
    "in addition , the assumption of a gapped spectrum of hole - doped ladders needs to be justified . on the theory side",
    "the assumption of hole localization should be relaxed , i.e. the system should be investigated in the context of a generalized hubbard model ."
