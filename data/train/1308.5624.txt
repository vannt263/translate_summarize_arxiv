    ". we could therefore define a markov process @xmath10 on @xmath5 with transition function @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a measurable set , @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the indicator function of a set @xmath15 .",
    "a probability measures @xmath16 is called a _ stationary measure _ if for any measurable @xmath15 we have : @xmath17 we call it an absolutely continuous stationary measure ( _ acsm _ ) , if it has a density with respect to the lebesgue measure whenever @xmath5 is a metric space .",
    "+ in this work we consider a different type of perturbation , the observational noise , which consists in replacing the orbit of the point @xmath13 at time @xmath18 , namely @xmath19 with @xmath20 there are several physical motivations to investigate the behavior of this kind of perturbation . in fact , as lalley and noble wrote in @xcite :    _ `` ... in this model our observations take the form @xmath21 , where @xmath22 are independent , mean zero random vectors .",
    "in contrast with the dynamical noise model ( e.g ; the random transformations ) , the noise does not interact with the dynamics : the deterministic character of the system , and its long range dependence , are preserved beneath the noise .",
    "due in part to this dependence , estimation in the observational noise model has not been broadly addressed by statisticians , though the model captures important features of many experimental situations . '' _",
    "judd @xcite , quoted in @xcite , also pointed out that :    _ `` ...",
    "the reality is that many physical systems are indistinguishable from deterministic systems , there is no apparent small dynamic noise , and what is often attributed as such is in fact model error . ''",
    "moreover , a system contaminated by the observational noise raises the natural and practical question whether it would be possible to recover the original signal , in our case the deterministic orbit @xmath23 . in the last years",
    "a few techniques have been proposed for such a noise reduction @xcite : we remind here the remarkable schreiber - lalley method @xcite , which provides a very consistent algorithm to perform the noise reduction when the underlying deterministic dynamical system has strong hyperbolic properties .",
    "another interesting work shows that in the computation of some statistical quantities , the dynamical noise corresponding to random transformations could be considered as an observational noise with the cauchy distribution @xcite .",
    "finally , the paper @xcite proves concentration inequalities for systems perturbed by observational noise .",
    "+ the present work try to re - frame the previous findings in terms of extreme value theory ( evt ) by adding a further motivation driven by the applicability of the whole evt for dynamical systems to experimental data .",
    "it should be a general praxis to check the role of instrument - like - perturbations before applying dynamical systems techniques to experimental datasets . in this sense , the dynamical systems considered in this paper share several properties with observed time series , as the observational noise acts exactly as a physical instrument .",
    "the goal is to exploit the recent advancements of the evt for dynamical systems to define in a more rigorous way the extremes of time series .",
    "a relevant example of a successful application of the theory presented in this paper to experimental datasets is given in @xcite , where temperature data are analyzed with the algorithmic procedure presented in section 4.2 .",
    "more specifically , our interest is to understand which way the results obtained on deterministic dynamical systems are altered by the addition of observational noise and in which cases one can recover classical evls .",
    "we start the discussion by summarizing the main findings of the evt for dynamical systems .",
    "+ the first rigorous mathematical approach to evt in dynamical systems goes back to the pioneer paper by collet @xcite .",
    "important contributions have successively been given in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "here we briefly recall the main findings deferring to the previous papers for the full demonstrations .",
    "+ let us consider a dynamical system @xmath24 , where @xmath5 is the invariant set in some manifold , usually @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the borel @xmath27-algebra , @xmath28 is a measurable map and @xmath29 a probability @xmath30-invariant borel measure .",
    "+ in order to adapt the evt to dynamical systems , we follow @xcite , by considering the stationary stochastic process @xmath31 given by :    @xmath32    where dist is a distance on the ambient space @xmath5 , @xmath33 is a given point and @xmath34 is a suitable function which will be specified later",
    ". this particular functional form has been introduced first by collet @xcite and allows for a direct connection between recurrence properties around a point of the phase space @xmath33 and the existence of evls .",
    "the object of interest is the distribution of @xmath35 , where @xmath36 ; we say that we have an evl for @xmath37 if there is a non - degenerate distribution function  @xmath38 $ ] with @xmath39 and , for every @xmath40 , there exists a sequence of levels @xmath41 , @xmath42 , such that @xmath43 and for which the following limit holds : @xmath44    the motivation for using a normalizing sequence @xmath45 satisfying comes from the case when @xmath46 are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d ) . in this setting , it is clear that @xmath47 , being @xmath48 the cumulative distribution function for the variable @xmath49 .",

    ", if for some constants @xmath59 we have @xmath60 .",
    "when the convergence occurs at continuity points of @xmath61 ( @xmath61 is non - degenerate ) then @xmath62 converges to one of the three evls rewritable in terms of the generalized extreme value ( gev ) distribution as :    @xmath63^{-1/{\\kappa}}\\right\\}. \\label{cumul}\\ ] ]    here @xmath64 is the shape parameter also called the tail index : when @xmath65 , the distribution corresponds to a gumbel evl ; when the tail index is positive , it corresponds to a frchet evl ; when @xmath66 is negative , it corresponds to a weibull evl .",
    "the evl obtained depends on the kind of observable chosen .",
    "in particular , in @xcite the authors have shown that , once taken the observable :    @xmath67    one gets a gumbel evl , here @xmath68 . in the next section",
    "we prove the existence of gumbel law for the maps perturbed with observational noise .",
    "it is in fact possible to introduce other observables than the one specified above in order to get convergence towards frechet and weibull evls .",
    "however , for any choice different from @xmath69 , the tail index depends on the local property of the measure . for every sequence @xmath70",
    "satisfying we define : @xmath71    when @xmath72 are not independent , the standard exponential law still applies under some conditions on the dependence structure .",
    "these conditions are the following :    * condition*[@xmath73[cond : d2 ] we say that @xmath74 holds for the sequence @xmath75 if for all @xmath76 and @xmath77 , @xmath78 where @xmath79 is decreasing in @xmath80 for each @xmath77 and @xmath81 when @xmath82 for some sequence @xmath83 .",
    "now , let @xmath84 be a sequence of integers such that @xmath85    * condition*[@xmath86[cond : d ] we say that @xmath87 holds for the sequence @xmath88 if there exists a sequence @xmath84 satisfying and such that @xmath89    by following freitas and freitas @xcite  theorem 1 , if conditions @xmath74 and @xmath87 hold for @xmath90 then there exists an evl for @xmath37 and @xmath91 + in the paper @xcite , freitas , freitas and todd made the interesting observation that the extreme value laws are intimately related to the concept of local recurrence , in particular to the first hitting time function in small sets . their analysis has been brought to systems perturbed with random transformations in @xcite . in section 3 we will show that these kind of results hold also for systems perturbed with observational noise , first by adapting the definition of first hitting time and then by showing that it follows an exponential law tempered by the strength of the perturbation .",
    "+ we remark that the analogy between extreme value laws and local recurrences is possible for particular observables of the type @xmath92 where @xmath33 is a given point .",
    "as explained in @xcite , the additional choice @xmath93 allows to get the gumbel law ( a direct proof of this fact is given after proposition [ p2 ] ) , and moreover it brings information on the local structure of the invariant measure , as we will explain in a moment .",
    "this represents the main motivation for using such observable although a more detailed discussion and other motivations can be found in @xcite .",
    "+ we conclude this introduction by stressing what we believe is an interesting and very general result .",
    "we will see that the probability @xmath94 which we will use to rule out the distribution of the maxima is the product between the invariant measure @xmath29 and the measure of the noise @xmath95 .",
    "whenever one is able to prove the existence of an extreme value law for the process @xmath96 with the observable ( [ g1 ] ) , then proposition [ p2 ] shows how the two sequences @xmath97 and @xmath98 appearing in the affine choice for @xmath45 ( see above ) , are related to the local behavior of the measure @xmath29 at a local scale given by the intensity of the noise .",
    "this local behavior is related to the fine structure of the measure @xmath29 .",
    "we have therefore a useful tool to detect the fine geometric properties of the invariant measure by calibrating the normalizing sequence @xmath45 until we get the gumbel law , and this at different scales for the noise .",
    "we now show how to adapt the evt for orbits of dynamical systems perturbed by instrument - like - error .",
    "each instrument introduces an effect related to the combined accuracy and precision of the measure by replacing the real ( unknown ) value with the biased indicated by the instrument itself . in general ,",
    "if the real dynamics can be represented by the map @xmath30 , what one observes is formally :    @xmath99    where @xmath100 is the truncation introduced by the instrument precision and @xmath101 is a random displacement from the real value .",
    "this displacement is what we have defined as observational noise .",
    "here it is rewritten as @xmath102 , with the parameter @xmath103 .",
    "+ although the paper is dedicated to the observational noise , for completeness and in light of applications on time series , we want remark also some relevant properties of truncations .",
    "the role of the truncation , important also for numerical computations , has been discussed in the book by knuth @xcite and then analyzed , among others , by @xcite . on the @xmath104 digit ,",
    "the truncation acts essentially as a random noise of variance @xmath105 .",
    "if @xmath106 the measure underlying @xmath107 will match the one of the original dynamics given by the map @xmath30 , if not the support will appear as a collection of dirac s deltas , precluding the convergence to the gev distribution @xcite .",
    "we defer to section 4.1 for a numerical study on the truncation error which should point out for which values of @xmath104 one should take truncations into account and whether @xmath108 ( the common truncation corresponding to a double precision representation ) is a good choice for representing the properties of a deterministic dynamics .",
    "we thus proceed to show that evls persist for chaotic dynamical systems , whenever they are perturbed with the observational noise @xcite .",
    "the proof we give is reminiscent of that of theorem d in @xcite .",
    "we first point out that , in order to guarantee the stationarity of the random process involved in the distribution of the maxima , we need to evaluate the observable @xmath34 at the point @xmath109 , where @xmath13 and @xmath110 is a random vector .",
    "for this reason and in order to avoid ambiguities , we will choose @xmath5 as a torus .",
    "another alternative would be to take @xmath5 which is strictly sent into itself by @xmath30 , @xmath111 , and with all the components of @xmath110 small enough ( see , for instance , proposition 4.5 in @xcite ) .",

    "some of the theoretical findings presented in the previous sections present a practical interest in a wide range of applications namely the analysis of the role of truncation errors for instrument with low accuracy , the statistics of points visited sporadically in the analysis of recurrence of time series and the possibility of computing attractor dimension by using eq .",
    "[ superformula ] as an alternative way to other techniques . for each maps , we present and comment numerical experiments and outline possible further applications . + before introducing such examples , let us make a useful comment .",
    "a close inspection to the proof of proposition [ p1 ] , shows that the parameter @xmath232 appears in the denominator of one factor in the r.h.s . of the term ( ii ) at the end of the proof .",
    "this means that the convergence gets better when @xmath232 is large , which is not surprising since a large value of the perturbation implies a more stochastic independence of the process . on the other hand ,",
    "if we want to use the form of the linear scaling parameter @xmath98 to catch the local properties of the invariant measure @xmath29 , we need small values of @xmath268 .",
    "a judicious balance of the value of @xmath232 between these two regimes is therefore necessary when we pursue such numerical analysis .",
    "the experiment consists in producing 30 orbits starting from different initial conditions taken on the support of the truncated measure .",
    "the length of the orbit is fixed according to the results presented in @xcite to be such that @xmath270 . in order to analyze the effect of varying the bin length combined to the order of the truncation",
    ", we consider three different values of @xmath77 .",
    "each series of @xmath34 is therefore divided in @xmath271 bins and in each of them the maxima @xmath272 are extracted and then fitted to the gev model via the l - moments procedure described in @xcite .",
    "note also that the points @xmath33 are chosen after applying the truncation .",
    "the results are shown in fig [ trunc ] where the behavior of the shape parameter @xmath273 is compared to the asymptotic gumbel law @xmath274 . in the deterministic limit @xmath275 the usual gumbel evl",
    "is recovered , whereas for @xmath276 the discretization of the invariant measure becomes relevant and the asymptotic evl appears as a collection of dirac deltas thus producing a divergence of the shape parameter from @xmath115 .",
    "this is exactly what is visible in fig [ trunc ] : the convergence gets worse when @xmath277 and at @xmath278 we are already unable to fit the gev distribution for all the @xmath33 points considered , although by increasing the bin length @xmath77 the convergence improves as one would expect .",
    "these results , as we tested , are reproducible in other maps and gives a more general indication that computing asymptotic properties on truncated series leads to estimation errors and divergence even at high order of truncation .",
    "+      with the introduction of the observational noise , the scaling parameter @xmath98 depends on the target point @xmath33 _ via _ the local density of the invariant measure in a ball whose radius is given by the error @xmath232 .",
    "in _ consequence 1 _ we said that if the point @xmath33 is visited with less frequency , the local density is of lower order with respect to @xmath232 , which means that one should go to higher values of @xmath77 in order to have a reliable statistics . here",
    "we want to test that the order of @xmath77 needed to get convergence to the asymptotic @xmath98 is lower for a highly recurrent point then for a sporadic one .",
    "as highly recurrent point we choose @xmath279 for the pomeau - manneville map in eq .",
    "[ pm ] and as sporadic one the point @xmath119 of the map introduced by hemmer and reported in eq .",
    "[ hemmereq ] .",
    "the experiment consists in computing @xmath280 realizations of the maps perturbed with observational noise .",
    "again , we fit the maxima of the observable @xmath34 to the gev distribution by using the @xmath281-moments procedure and compare the values of @xmath98 obtained experimentally to the theoretical ones stated in proposition [ p2 ] .",
    "we report here the results for three different bin lengths @xmath282 in fig .",
    "[ pmfig ] for the pomeau manneville map and in fig .",
    "[ hemmerfig ] for hemmer map .",
    "the figures show how @xmath98 varies as a function of the noise @xmath283 , in terms of @xmath284 . in both cases",
    "we observe convergence towards the theoretical values ( solid lines ) for high values of @xmath268 ( low orders in @xmath284 ) whereas in the limit of weak noise one must increase the bin lengths to get convergence .",
    "the main result to be highlighted here is the better convergence of highly recurrent points with respect to the ones visited sporadically .",
    "this important property can be used to study time series recurrences and identify extremes as the points visited rarely for which the convergence towards the asymptotic parameters is bad .",
    "the main advantage of studying recurrence properties in this way over applying other techniques is due to the built - in test of convergence of this method : even for a point rarely recurrent there will be a time scale @xmath77 such that the fit converges . for smaller @xmath77",
    ", we can therefore such a @xmath33 as a _ sporadically recurrent _ point of the orbit as explained in @xcite .",
    "there we show how to use this property to define rigorous recurrences in long temperature records collected at several weather stations .",
    "the convergence or divergence of the fit allows us for discriminating between temperatures belonging to the normal variability associated to the time scales defined by the bin length ( e.g. the seasonal cycle ) or as anormal temperature if there are no or few recurrences in @xmath77 .",
    "as we have already said in _ consequence 3 _ , if the invariant measure is not absolutely continuous , one could still perform the previous analysis , but both the ambient space dimension @xmath139 and the local dimension @xmath250 will enter in the computation of @xmath98 via eq .",
    "[ superformula ] .",
    "this formula can be used in principle to test whether a map has a fractal support by comparing the local dimensions with the the ambient space dimension : it is enough to check how the obtained @xmath98 depend on the intensity of the noise @xmath283 .",
    "we should point out that , as we said in the footnote 1 , we are targeting the hausdorff dimension of the measure .",
    "we test this idea on the classical iterated function system @xmath285 used to produce a cantor set : @xmath286 where @xmath287 $ ] , and we set @xmath288 .",
    "therefore , at each time step , we have the same probability to iterate @xmath289 or @xmath290 ; the _ balanced _ invariant measure associated to the map and the way to construct the orbit to detect the maxima are described in @xcite .",
    "the results for different @xmath77 are reported in fig .",
    "[ bm ] for an average among @xmath280 different realizations and three different bin lengths @xmath291 .",
    "experimental data follow the prediction of eq  [ superformula ] with @xmath292 as hausdorff dimension and @xmath216 as ambient space dimension but only up to a certain noise intensity @xmath284 beyond which they reach a _",
    "plateau_. a justification for this behavior is that when the noise intensity is very small , the system needs longer trajectories - higher @xmath77 - to explore the ball of radius @xmath268 .",
    "this gives an implicit criterion for the selection of the bin length @xmath77 needed to observe reliable results and it says that one should be careful in applications where the intensity of the observational noise is small compared to the scale of the dynamics .",
    "this analysis is confirmed by the results obtained for the lozi map : @xmath293 for which we consider the classical set of parameter @xmath294 and @xmath295 .",
    "young @xcite proved the existence of the srb measure for the lozi map and found the value @xmath296 for the hausdorff dimension of the measure by computing the lyapunov exponents and using a kaplan - yorke like formula .",
    "the experiments is exactly the same described for the cantor set and the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ lozifig ] for the values of @xmath297 .",
    "agreement with the theoretical behavior of @xmath98 , as expected from eq .",
    "[ superformula ] represented in fig .",
    "[ lozifig ] by the solid straight lines , is found for small values of @xmath284 which means for large @xmath268 .",
    "for the lozi map the convergence is worse then for the cantor case .",
    "this phenomenon has been already observed in @xcite and , up to now , there is not a clear explanation for it .",
    "however , by scanning numerically the ( @xmath298 ) space , one can infer the intervals of such parameters such that the @xmath98 converge towards the asymptotic results : for example , when @xmath299 , an order of noise intensity @xmath300 is needed to get convergence to the predicted theoretical values .",
    "since there is only a limited range of @xmath284 such that the @xmath98 convergence to the prediction of eq .",
    "[ superformula ] , one has to take extremely care on using the results obtained with this method to estimate fractal dimensions . a good strategy to overcome",
    "this problem is to discard the value of @xmath98 which show no dependence on @xmath284 and check that the remaining points are sufficient to perform a linear fit of @xmath98 vs @xmath284 .",
    "+ the possibility of computing fractal dimensions by using a random perturbation of a dynamical system is an interesting fact : when random perturbations are applied , one usually expects the orbit to explore asymptotically the ambient space and this normally hide the fractal property of the measure .",
    "instead , as we said at the beginning of this section , for reasonable choices of @xmath77 and @xmath284 , one gets accurate information on the fractal dimension by fitting the @xmath250 parameter of eq . [ superformula ] .",
    "this finding opens new questions , for instance if it is possible to get analogous formulas in the case of random transformations .",
    "an application can be to adapt this theory for multi - scale systems whose description is usually made through an approximation of a dynamic consisting of a deterministic and a stochastic components .",
    "for example , by tuning the strength of the stochastic components , one can study how the noise affects the structure of the deterministic dynamics ; these aspects will be explored in forthcoming works .",
