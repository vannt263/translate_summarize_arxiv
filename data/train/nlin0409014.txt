    "one of the effective methods of analysis of several systems is based on their representation by discrete models . for this one can use the space discretization as well as the time one . using the space discretization the initial ( continuous ) system is modelled by a finite set of elements that are coupled according to some rules , which follows from the nature of the system of interest .",
    "each element of these then occurs to be some ( small ) dynamical system which may be described by a ( small ) set of dynamical variables . if the time is also discretized , i.e. if the evolution of these dynamical subsystems is considered at discrete time  steps , then such subsystems are treated as maps . in this case",
    "spatio - tempotal models are said to be _ lattice _ of coupled maps .",
    "the examples of application of the space ",
    "time discretization in studies of the nonlinear media are numerous . here",
    "we mention the problems related to chaos and noise in distributed systems @xcite , to description of the excitable media @xcite and some other similar problems ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . moreover ,",
    "any numerical analysis of a continuous system has in fact to be reduced to the study of space  time discretized model .    in principle , a variety of different space  time lattices may be used .",
    "the mostly studied are the models where only the nearest ",
    "neighbour ( local ) coupling is taken into account ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . in other models the global coupling , i.e. when all elements of the system are coupled with each other , is assumed @xcite . in lattices with the local coupling , as a rule ,",
    "this is considered as a diffusional one @xcite .",
    "mainly , these models are used to analyse the spatio  temporal chaos , pattern formation , self  organization phenomena , etc .",
    "@xcite    if all the elements are the same , then such lattices are called homogeneous . if , however , elements are different , then the lattice is not a homogeneous one , and its investigation is much more complex . with applied point of view the nonhomegeneity may be two  fold : either elements of the system have different maps , or they have functionally identical maps but with different control parameters .",
    "the nonhomogeneities are usually said to be _",
    "defects_. the relative position of defects may vary from a single localized inclusion to a space  periodic ordering .    in most of studies of coupled map lattices ,",
    "the case of homogeneous lattices ( and mainly numerically ) has been addressed .",
    "however , it is clear , that the assumption of the homogeneity is a crude simplification .",
    "therefore it is rather important to investigate the sensitivity of the lattice dynamics to certain nonhomogeneities ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the present study is devoted to the spatially inhomogeneous 1d lattices ( in fact , chains ) of diffusively coupled piecewise ",
    "linear maps , which refer to some models of the one  dimensional excitable media @xcite .",
    "the defects are determined as maps with different parameter values . using the exact calculation of the lyapunov exponents we analyse the behaviour of the lattice with a localized defect and with the space",
    " periodic nonhomegeneity .",
    "we also describe the structure of the phase space of such systems .",
    "here we consider the dynamics of two models of inhomogeneous active media : one  dimensional ( annular ) chain of coupled maps with periodic nonhomegeneity and with one localized defect . to introduce the notations",
    ", we remind that the term `` map '' is implied transformation of some interval @xmath0 on itself : @xmath1 , where @xmath2\\in { \\bf r}^1 $ ] , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 is some function and @xmath6 is a parameter . in terms of iterations @xmath7 this may be written as @xmath8 , @xmath4 .",
    "the nonhomegeneity means nonuniformity of the parameter @xmath6 along the chain of maps .",
    "the functions @xmath9 are chosen in such a way that they model the one  component active medium .",
    "consider the system of @xmath10 diffusively coupled maps @xmath11 with periodic boundary conditions , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 being the discrete space coordinate , @xmath14 is the discrete time , @xmath15 is the ( constant ) diffusion coefficient , and @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the parameters of the map .",
    "this choice of the coupling means that the spatial and temporal actions in map ( [ main ] ) occur simultaneously .",
    "let @xmath9 be the piecewise linear function : @xmath18 this function @xmath19 is chosen in this form in order to represent ( in the discretized version ) the basic model of the one  component excitable medium , which is described by the kolmogorov  petrovsky ",
    "piskunov type equation : @xmath20 this equation is frequently used in biophysical problems , in the combustion theory , in chemical kinetics ( e.g. in the theory of the belousov  zhabotinsky reaction ) , solid - state physics , etc .",
    "( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "one can see that the piecewise linear function @xmath21 has a constant slope @xmath22 . depending on @xmath23 the map @xmath24",
    "may exhibit qualitatively different behaviour . for @xmath25 ( see fig.[mapg]a ) it gives rise to a regular dynamics with one or two stable point , depending on the value of the parameter @xmath17 ( points a and b in fig.[mapg]a ) , which are attractive for almost all points of the phase space .",
    "for @xmath26 the slope of @xmath27 is larger then one ( see fig.[mapg]b ) .",
    "that means , that for the finite motion of phase points the dynamics would be chaotic .",
    "the uniform model ( [ main ] ) based on the coupled maps , which are described by functions ( [ g ] ) , is known ( see @xcite ) .",
    "following @xcite consider this system as an @xmath10dimensional piecewise  linear map @xmath28 . because @xmath19 is the piecewise  linear function with the constant derivative ,",
    "the differential @xmath29 of the map @xmath30 is a matrix with constant coefficients .",
    "this easily allows us to find the lyapunov exponents @xmath31 of such map .",
    "if @xmath32 are the eigenvalues of @xmath33 , then @xmath34 .",
    "if among all the values @xmath32 there exists an eigenvalue located outside the unit circle on the complex plane , then any trajectory of the map @xmath30 is unstable .",
    "otherwise the model has the regular dynamics .",
    "thus , to know qualitatively the behavior of the system it is sufficient to find the location of the eigenvalues @xmath32 on the complex plane .    to find @xmath32 we should analyse the characteristic polynomial for the differential of the @xmath10dimensional map , which may be expressed via the determinants of three  diagonal matrices of different dimension . for these determinants",
    "recurrent relations may be obtained .",
    "taking the recurrent relations as difference equations with the given initial conditions we can find the solutions which are proportional to the chebyshev polynomials with a linear function of the eigenvalues of @xmath29 @xcite . using",
    "then the properties of the chebyshev polynomials it can be shown that the characteristic polynomial may be reduced to the quadratic trinomial of a certain function @xmath32 .",
    "calculation of @xmath32 and analysis of their location on the complex plane shows that the parametric space of the system ( [ main ] ) , ( [ g ] ) has two regions with qualitatively different behavior ( fig.[d1d2hom ] ) .    1 .",
    "the region @xmath35 , with the values of the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which correspond to the regular dynamics of the model .",
    "this implies that the modules of all the eigenvalues of the differential of the map @xmath30 are less than unity .",
    "the region @xmath38 where at least one of the eigenvalues @xmath32 satisfies the condition @xmath39 . generally , the system may have an infinite dynamics .",
    "however , if the dynamics is finite the system ( [ main ] ) , ( [ g ] ) behaves chaotically @xcite .    the system ( [ main ] ) , ( [ g ] ) is an uniform since all its elements are identical ( one has the same map @xmath40 for all the elements ) .",
    "futher we will assume that each element of the system has the same map @xmath41 but along the chain the values of the control parameter @xmath42 may differ .",
    "but we will see that the dynamics of both uniform and nonuniform chains does not depends on @xmath17 . ] .",
    "we assume that only two types of elements exist in the system .",
    "the corresponding values we denote as @xmath36 and @xmath43 . as for the case of uniform system we will use the periodic boundary conditions , @xmath44 .",
    "the periodic spatial nonhomegeneity implies in our case that the chain has elements with alternating values of the parameters in the map @xmath9 , e.g. @xmath45 .",
    "this particular nonuniform model allows a complete analytical analysis .",
    "consider the system of coupled elements : @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath10 is even ( to satisfy the periodic boundary condition ) , and the function @xmath9 is given by ( [ g ] ) . to analyse the dynamics of this system we calculate the lyapunov exponents using the approach described above .",
    "the differential of the @xmath10dimensional map corresponding to the system ( [ period ] ) reads @xmath48 to find the eigenvalues @xmath32 , @xmath49 of the matrix @xmath50 , we calculate the determinant @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 defined by the relations @xmath54 , @xmath55 . making expansion of the determinant",
    "we obtain : @xmath56 where @xmath57 it is not hard to see that @xmath58 may be obtained from @xmath59 exchanging the arguments @xmath60 .",
    "this suggest the way of finding @xmath59 using the recurrent relation . expanding @xmath61 ( along the first line ) we obtain :",
    "@xmath62 this allows us to express determinants of the odd order via determinants of the even one , @xmath63 and obtain then the recurrent relation for the even determinants @xmath64 one can treat eq.([five ] ) as a difference equation with the initial conditions @xmath65 solving then ( [ five ] ) , ( [ six ] ) together with ( [ four ] ) , we arrive at : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the second order chebyshev polynomial . in turn , for @xmath58 we get : @xmath68 now , using the obtained relations for @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , we finally arrive at : @xmath72    this allows us to find the eigenvalues of the differential of the map ( [ period ] ) , ( [ g ] ) . as follows from eq.([seven ] ) , @xmath73 or , @xmath74 .",
    "here we used the relation between the second order chebyshev polynomials @xmath67 and the first order @xmath75 . since @xmath76 where @xmath77",
    ", then with @xmath78 we obtain from eq.([eight ] ) : @xmath79 or @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath84 , we obtain a simple equation : @xmath85 solving it with respect to @xmath86 , we find the set of eigenvalues of the differential of the map ( [ period ] ) , ( [ g ] ) : @xmath87 where @xmath88 .",
    "the dynamics of the system ( [ period ] ) , ( [ g ] ) would be completely regular if all the values of @xmath32 were within the unit circle on the complex plane .",
    "since all the @xmath89 are real , the condition of the regular dynamics is : @xmath90 the first inequality is always realized when @xmath91 .",
    "thus , second one defines the restriction for the region with regular dynamics .    in its turn , in the region of the parametric space where the lyapunov exponent @xmath92 the condition @xmath93 is satisfied",
    "therefore , the boundary separating two regions with regular and chaotic dynamics is a surface in the three  dimensional parametric space @xmath94 , which is given by the relation : @xmath95 to illustrate the obtained results we show in fig.[d1d2per ] cross  sections of this surface by the planes @xmath96 , with @xmath97 being the nonhomegeneity parameter .",
    "denote @xmath35 the region with regular dynamics and @xmath38 the region where @xmath98 .",
    "these two regions are separated by the boundary , defined ( implicitly ) by eq.([ten ] ) . in fig.[d1d2per ] we also show by dashed line the corresponding boundary between @xmath35 and @xmath38 for the case of _ homogeneous _",
    "@xmath99 system of coupled maps ( fig.[d1d2hom ] ) .",
    "as it follows from the fig.[d1d2per ] , for @xmath100 for all values of @xmath37 , @xmath36 the model demonstrates the chaotic dynamics .",
    "for @xmath101 the region @xmath35 arises where the system has regular dynamics .",
    "this region where @xmath102 is , in fact , a subregion of the corresponding region @xmath35 of the regular dynamics of the homogeneous model .    for @xmath103 there exist such @xmath37 and @xmath36 that the homogeneous model exhibits the chaotic dynamics , while the inhomogeneous still has the regular one .",
    "note that the restriction @xmath104 corresponds to the condition @xmath105 . for @xmath106",
    "the region @xmath35 vanishes and for all @xmath37 , @xmath36 the model ( [ period ] ) , ( [ g ] ) demonstrates only the chaotic dynamics . as it also follows from fig.[d1d2per ] , two qualitatively different regimes make take place : @xmath23 belongs to the region of the regular behavior , @xmath43 to the region of chaos with @xmath98 , with the global dynamics being regular .",
    "similarly one can observe just the opposite case of the chaotic dynamics of the periodically inhomogeneous model .",
    "realisation of the particular regime depends on the value of the diffusion constant @xmath37 .",
    "let us now turn to the case of spatially inhomogeneous model of diffusively coupled maps for the case of a single `` defect '' .",
    "in this case among @xmath10 element of the system only one element has the parameter @xmath43 ( see ( [ g ] ) ) , while the other @xmath107 elements have parameter @xmath36 . assume for simplicity that this element is located at @xmath108 .",
    "then we can write for this model : @xmath109 where @xmath110 . let the function @xmath111 is still given by ( [ g ] ) .",
    "calculate now the differential of the corresponding map for the system ( [ defect ] ) , ( [ g ] ) : @xmath112 if we apply the same approach as previously , to find the lyapunov exponents of the model ( [ defect ] ) , ( [ g ] ) , we should have to get the roots of the polynomial of the @xmath113th order .",
    "this can be done only numerically .",
    "instead we will use somewhat different approach , which significantly facilitates the analysis .    applying the estimate of the eigenvalues of the matrix ( [ twelve ] ) according to the gershgorin s theorem @xcite , we may evaluate the location of the region of the regular dynamics . by this theorem , all the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath114 which belongs to the union of the discs on the complex plane : @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 is either a row almost  norm of the matrix @xmath118 , @xmath119 , or a column almost  norm of the matrix @xmath118 , @xmath120 . since the differential of the map ( [ twelve ] ) is a real symmetric matrix then",
    ", ( i ) the row and column almost  norms are equal , and ( ii ) the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath29 are real .",
    "therefore , the gershgorin s discs transform on the real axis as : @xmath121 because @xmath122 , from ( [ twelve ] ) we get : @xmath123    moreover , since @xmath117 does not depend on @xmath124 and in the differential of map @xmath29 ( [ twelve ] ) there exist only two different diagonal elements , the eigenvalues of @xmath29 belong to the union of the two intervals : @xmath125 then , taking into account that @xmath36 , @xmath43 , @xmath15 , we obtain the _ upper _ bound for the modules of the eigenvalues of @xmath29 : @xmath126 thus , the region @xmath127 in the parametric space @xmath128 , which satisfies the conditions @xmath129 corresponds to the regular dynamics of the inhomogeneous model ( [ defect ] ) , ( [ g ] ) , while the region @xmath130 corresponds to the positive @xmath131 .",
    "the regions @xmath127 and @xmath132 are shown in fig.[tilded1d2in3d ] .",
    "the region @xmath127 is the _ lower _ bound of the region with the regular dynamics , because it is obtained via the _ upper _ bound of the eigenvalues of the map differential .",
    "this means that any point of @xmath127 would correspond to the regular dynamics , while any point of @xmath132 would correspond either the regular dynamics , or ( if the motion is finite ) the chaotic one .",
    "it is significant that the obtained estimate is applicable not only for the model with a single defect , but for a _ wide class _ of annular chains of maps with diffusive coupling ( [ main ] ) , which have only two types of elements @xmath133with different parameters @xmath134 in the function @xmath135 .",
    "this follows from the fact that the particular number of elements of each type and their mutual location is not important .",
    "indeed , almost  norms of the differentials of the maps of all such systems are the same and the centres of the two possible intervals , which contain according to the gershgorin s theorem , the eigenvalues of @xmath29 , do coincide .    in the case when the two intervals , which we use to estimate @xmath32 , do not intersect , there is , according to the gershgorin s theorem , `` clusterization '' of the eigenvalues of the differential of the map .",
    "namely , @xmath136 eigenvalues @xmath32 , @xmath137 , will belong to one interval , and @xmath138 eigenvalues @xmath139 , @xmath140 will belong to the other interval . here",
    "@xmath136 is the number of elements with parameter @xmath23 , and , respectively , @xmath138 is the number of elements with parameter @xmath141 .",
    "unfortunately , this does not help to improve the estimate of the region with the regular dynamics .",
    "let us compare the estimate ( [ thirteen ] ) with the exact result , that has been obtained above for the model with the periodic nonhomegeneity .",
    "obviously , the latter model belongs to the class of models for which the this estimate holds true .",
    "to illustrate this we show the cross ",
    "sections @xmath142 of the region @xmath35 , which corresponds to the regular dynamics of ( [ period ] ) , ( [ g ] ) , and of its estimate , the region @xmath127 ( see fig.[estimexper ] ) . from fig.[estimexper ] it follows that the estimate ( [ thirteen ] ) of the region with the regular dynamics is rather adequate , however it does not show that for @xmath103 the region of the regular dynamics of ( [ period ] ) , ( [ g ] ) includes the region of the regular dynamics of the spatially homogeneous system .",
    "turn now to the map ( [ defect ] ) , ( [ g ] ) , which refer to the case of a single defect and find the eigenvalues of the differential of map ( [ twelve ] ) numerically .",
    "one can write for the characteristic polynomial : @xmath143 where @xmath144 . expanding @xmath145 in the first line we arrive at @xmath146b_{n-1}- 2\\varepsilon ^2b_{n-2}-2(-1)^n\\varepsilon ^n,\\ ] ] with @xmath147 as previously , we use the first line factorization of @xmath61 to obtain the recurrent relation , @xmath148 . using the initial conditions , @xmath149 , @xmath150",
    ", we obtain : @xmath151 where @xmath67 is the second order chebyshev polynomial . taking into account eq.([sixteen ] ) and representation of @xmath67 , @xmath152 where @xmath78 , we recast eq.([fifteen ] ) into the following form : @xmath153 .\\ ] ] thus , the characteristic equation for the differential of the map ( [ twelve ] ) reads @xmath154 finding numerically the roots of this equation , we obtain @xmath32 .",
    "comparing @xmath139 with unity for different sets of @xmath36 , @xmath43 , @xmath37 , for the annular chain of diffusively coupled maps with a single defect we find the regions @xmath35 and @xmath38 with qualitatively different dynamics . in fig.[d1d2singl ] we show cross  sections of these regions by the planes with the fixed values of @xmath155 , where @xmath156 .",
    "the estimate ( [ thirteen ] ) of the region with the regular dynamics is marked by the dashed line .",
    "as in the case of the periodic nonhomegeneity , the actual region for positive @xmath157 is larger than that predicted by the estimate .",
    "however for the negative @xmath157 the estimate is in a perfect agreement with the numerical results as well as with the results corresponding to the homogeneous chain .",
    "thus , if one of the elements of the chain had the parameter smaller than that of the others , there would be no impact on the global dynamics of the system .",
    "on the other hand , if the parameter which refers to the defect had larger value than that of the other elements , this would diminish the region of the regular dynamics as compared to the case of the uniform system .",
    "we investigated the dynamics of diffusively coupled one  dimensional maps , which model one  dimensional excitable medium with space nonhomegeneity .",
    "we considered different types of the nonhomogeneities .",
    "for all systems , with the spatial nonhomegeneity , which may be described in terms of two types of elements with different values of the control parameter , we found _ analytically _ a lower bound of the region in the parametric space where the ensemble exhibits the regular dynamics .",
    "this estimate has been obtained by localizing the eigenvalues of the differential of the map . for two different model of this class",
    "we also obtained exact analytical and numerical results which completely characterize the dynamics of the system .",
    "we observed that all three approaches ( the approximate analytical analysis of the chain with two types of elements ( [ thirteen ] ) , the exact solution for the spatially periodic defects (  2.2 ) and numerical study (  2.3 ) of the model with a single defect ) show the possibility of two qualitatively different types of the ensemble behavior . in the first case",
    "the system demonstrates a regular global behavior when one value of its parameter belongs to the region with the regular dynamics and the other one belongs to the region with the unstable dynamics .",
    "vice versa , in the second case the global dynamics occurs to be unstable , and if the motion is finite  chaotic .",
    "the particular type of the chain behavior depends on the diffusive parameter @xmath158 .",
    "obviously , if @xmath158 is large enough , the global dynamics would not be regular .",
    "we wish to stress that according to our knowledge , the present study is the first attempt of the _ analytical _ description of the dynamics of inhomogeneous systems of coupled maps .",
    "these systems , being of significant importance from the point of view of applications , may exhibit a rich physical behavior , giving rise to a lot of new and interesting problems .",
    "one can mention such problems as properties of the wave travelling along the chain and influence of the defects on these motions , dynamics of the ensemble with time ",
