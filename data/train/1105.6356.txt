    "[ sec : i ] _ navin alahari _ ( chair ) made a short overview of what the community expects to learn , what are the main experimental and theoretical difficulties , and how we can proceed in the future .",
    "in particular , he pointed out that he organized this meeting because  _ there are some questions that can not be answered with google _ \" .",
    "reluctantly , i tend to agree .",
    "there were 77 talks by experts in the field .",
    "i will comment on a few of the physics topics discussed during the presentations .",
    "my description is evidently limited in scope due to the short space .",
    "_ sidney gales _ presented an overview of the future of the spiral 2 facility at ganil , france , which promises to break the high intensity frontier for both stable and ",
    "_ exotic _ \" beams .",
    "the construction will occur in two phases , with the production of radioactive beams planned for 2015 .",
    "physics with radioactive and stable - ion high - intensity beams at 1 - 20 mev / nucleon will allow , among many other processes , the study of fusion - evaporation with very small cross sections , possibly at the nb level .    _",
    "peter thirolf _ introduced the extreme light infrastructure ( eli - nuclear physics ) facility to be built in bucharest , romania , by the european community .",
    "this facility will be devoted to research with high - intensity lasers ( 20 petawatts ) , up to 5 orders of magnitude higher than today s laser intensity .",
    "it would eventually allow to study laser induced fission - fusion events .",
    "if all goes as planned , the facility would be operational by 2015 .    _",
    "monier - garbet _ also described the outcome of a new heavy - weight facility : iter , the _ international project for thermonuclear fusion_. this project ( presently estimated at 15 billion euros ) will open a new epoch for studies of fusion plasmas .",
    "iter is designed to confine a deuteron - tritium plasma in which @xmath0-particle heating dominates all other forms of plasma heating .",
    "iter s principal goal is to design , construct and operate a tokamak experiment at a scale which satisfies the objective of using _ fusion energy for peaceful purposes_. iter s basic research will be atomic physics and material science . the generation of commercial energy by using thermonuclear fusion will be a quest for future post - iter projects .",
    "humanity will profit enormously if this is realized .",
    "as mentioned by _ s. umar _ , no practical ab - initio many - body theory for fusion exists .",
    "all approaches involve two prongs : a ) calculate an ion - ion ( usually one - dimensional ) phenomenological potential ( wood - saxon , proximity , folding , bass , etc . ) using frozen densities , or microscopic , macroscopic - microscopic methods using collective variables ( chf , atdhf , empirical methods ) , and b ) employ quantum mechanical tunneling methods for the reduced one - body problem ( wkb , iwbc ) , incorporating quantum mechanical processes by hand , including neutron transfer and excitations of the entrance channel nuclei ( cc ) .",
    "fusion cross sections can be calculated from the equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the center of mass energy , @xmath3 is the reduced wavelength and @xmath4 .",
    "the cross section is proportional to @xmath5 , the area of the quantum wave .",
    "each part of the wave corresponds to different impact parameters having different probabilities for fusion . as the impact parameter increases , so does the angular momentum , hence the reason for the @xmath6 term .",
    "@xmath7 is the probability that fusion occurs at a given impact parameter , or angular momentum .",
    "the barrier penetration method ( bpm ) assumes that fusion occurs when the particle ( with mass @xmath8 ) penetrates the coulomb barrier and @xmath9 is calculated in a one - dimensional potential model , e.g. by using the wkb approximation or alike .    from @xmath10 one can calculate the average value of @xmath11 from @xmath12 and many other relevant quantities .",
    "sometimes , for a better visualization , or for extrapolation to low energies , one uses the concept of _ astrophysical s - factor _ , redefining the cross section as @xmath13 , \\label{se}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 , with @xmath15 being the relative velocity .",
    "the exponential function is an approximation to @xmath16 for a square - well nuclear potential plus coulomb potential , whereas the factor @xmath17 is proportional to the area appearing in eq .",
    "sometimes one just plots the cross section as @xmath18 $ ] .      in order to use eq .",
    "[ eqnf ] one needs the nucleus - nucleus potential .",
    "this is a _ badly known beast_. in some cases , one includes the effects of other relevant non - fusion channels ( which might be a very large number , say @xmath19 ) .",
    "then one adds an imaginary part to the real potential and it becomes much more than a beast ; something like a combination of the _ devil@xmath20 , the alien@xmath20 _ and _ the predator@xmath20_. some have tried to tame this thing from first principles .",
    "but , except for few heroic attempts , we seem to have given up .",
    "we just fit whatever we can fit and we get whatever parameters of a potential function we can .",
    "then we wisely call it the  op \" .    in this meeting",
    "there were some discussions on the op appropriate for fusion reactions .",
    "_ d. pereira _ reported extensions of the so paulo potential , and a new approach for its imaginary part to account for surface dissipative processes in heavy ion reactions . _",
    "pereira _ showed that this method could reproduce the @xmath21li(25 mev)+@xmath22sn and the @xmath23he(230 mev)+@xmath24c elastic scattering data rather well .",
    "the _ so paulo potential _ has become popular in fusion reactions , due to its simple form @xcite .",
    "so , does the m3y potential , which was originally developed to treat heavy ion collisions at @xmath25 mev / nucleon .",
    "it does not really matter : _ we love delta - function _ potentials .",
    "in fact , looking from very far away , the nucleon - nucleon potential does indeed resembles a delta - function .",
    "an that is why we use them in effective field theories , mean field calculations ( skyrrme interaction ) , and in many other areas .",
    "simple .    _",
    "g. marti _ presented results for @xmath26li + @xmath27se elastic scattering at low energies .",
    "the data seem to show another effect which goes by the name  _ threshold anomaly _ \" .",
    "this was also discussed in the talk by _",
    "m. sinha_. after fitting the op to elastic scattering data , the anomaly appears in plots of energy dependence of the real , @xmath28 , and imaginary , @xmath29 , separate parts of the op at a certain nucleus - nucleus distance .",
    "as the bombarding energy decreases , @xmath29 remains rather flat and below a certain energy value it quickly drops to zero , whereas @xmath28 increases slowly and below the same energy reverses its trend @xcite .",
    "the behavior of @xmath28 and @xmath29 is compatible with dispersion relations ( yes . we believe that the _ op is an analytic function _ in a complex plane ! ) .",
    "fusion with loosely bound nuclei shows a  _ breakup threshold anomaly _ \" , meaning a small rise of the potentials before the anomaly threshold @xcite .",
    "i am not sure what kind of physics one wants to extract from ( breakup ) threshold anomalies .",
    "the physics seems to be non - universal , e.g. , _ marti _ claims that , for the elastic scattering of @xmath21li the behavior of both types of potentials as a function of energy is compatible with the presence of the threshold anomaly . but _ c.s .",
    "palshetkar _ has reported the absence of the anomaly for @xmath30be+@xmath31y system .",
    "do you want to know what anomaly means ?  look !",
    "i have found something new ! \" .    _",
    "lin _ also explored the concept of _  surface anomaly\"_. what is anomalous here ?",
    "the diffuseness parameters @xmath32 of interaction potentials extracted from the fusion data at not only high energies but also extremely low energies are prominent larger than the traditional value ( 0.65 fm ) .",
    "_ s. umar _ discussed results from time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) calculations using skyrme functionals .",
    "his goal was to deduce microscopically the potential barriers needed to calculate fusion reaction cross sections .",
    "although heavy systems pose a greater challenge , such microscopic calculations may provide an insight into these collisions .",
    "it is well know that the bpm does not work .",
    "a good example is shown in figure [ fig:1 ] , taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . only by including coupling to other channels",
    ", the fusion cross sections can be reproduced .",
    "in fact , sub - barrier fusion enhancement can be easily understood .",
    "assume that the initial channel energy @xmath2 splits into two channel energies during fusion , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "then the cross section becomes an approximate energy average of the bpm , @xmath35/2 $ ] . due to the exponential behavior of tunneling probabilities , the decreased cross section @xmath36 more than compensates the increase @xmath37 due to the reduction of the barrier height .    in coupled channels",
    "schemes one expands the total wavefunction for the system as @xmath38 where @xmath39 form the channel basis , @xmath0 is a dynamical variable ( e.g. , the distance between the nuclei ) , and @xmath40 are intrinsic coordinates . inserting this expansion in the schrdinger equation yields a set of cc equations in the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 is whatever potential couples the channels @xmath43 and @xmath44 and @xmath45 is some sort of transition energy , or transition momentum . in the presence of continuum states ,",
    "continuum - continuum coupling(relevant for breakup channels ) can be included by _ discretizing the continuum_. this goes by the name of continuum discretized coupled - channels ( cdcc ) calculations .",
    "fancy , but also vulgar .",
    "there are several variations of cc equations , e.g. , a set of differential equations for the wavefunctions , instead of using basis amplitudes .",
    "coupled channels calculations were discussed in details by _ l.f .",
    "canto _ in his review talk of fusion reactions .",
    "cdcc calculations for d+a with rotational and vibrational channels was reported by _",
    "chauhuu - tai _ , while _",
    "a. moro _ discussed a simultaneous analysis of elastic , breakup , and fusion channels for the @xmath46he+@xmath47pb reaction at energies near the coulomb barrier .",
    "it seems that continuum - continuum couplings hinder fusion , specially above the barrier , but the reason is not well understood .",
    "coupled channels calculations with a large number of channels in continuum couplings , is one of the least controllable calculations in physics .",
    "anything can happen because of the phases of matrix elements : the couplings can add as @xmath48 ( destructive ) or as @xmath49 or as @xmath50 ( constructive ) , depending on the system and on the nuclear model .",
    "such suppressions or enhancements are difficult to understand .",
    "_ it is simply disgusting_. maybe we should not try to understand .",
    "but as wigner once said : _  it is nice that your computer can understand this stuff .",
    "but i wish i could understand it myself\"_.    cdcc calculations were also reported by _",
    "k. hagino _ for @xmath51o+@xmath47pb .",
    "he included collective and non - collective states , weakly coupled , a total of 64 non - collective levels up to 7 mev , with a nearly  complete \" level scheme both for the excitation energies @xmath52 as for the @xmath53 parameters of a deformed nuclear model .",
    "he concluded that the energy dependence of fusion cross section is not altered much by these couplings .",
    "coupled channels calculations were also reported by _ t. ichikawa_. _ c.j .",
    "lin _ also claimed that the  surface anomaly \" ( see section [ sec:2.2 ] ) disappears when cc are taken into account .",
    "one can try to extract some extra juice from a set of experimental data by recasting them in a different way .",
    "for example , assume an extreme classical model in which fusion occurs .",
    "also assume that fusion is hindered by coulomb recoil .",
    "then the fusion cross section is given approximately by @xmath54 where @xmath55 for @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , otherwise .",
    "@xmath58 is the coulomb barrier height and @xmath59 is the touching distance between the nuclei . in this approximation ,",
    "the second derivative of @xmath60 yields @xmath61 i.e. it spikes at the value of the coulomb barrier height .",
    "quantum mechanics smears out the @xmath62-function @xcite , but @xmath63 should still peak at the position of the coulomb barrier height .",
    "coupling to other channels fragments the peak and broadens it further , as seen in experiments .",
    "@xmath63 is thus a probe of _ barrier heights _ @xcite .",
    "_ quasi - elastic scattering _ maybe defined as a sum of all reaction processes other than fusion , e.g. elastic scattering , inelastic scattering , transfer , breakup , and so on . thus fusion and quasi - elastic ( qe ) scattering are complementary to each other : if @xmath64 , a similar relationship should be applicable to @xmath65 .",
    "it turns out that this is true for the ratio of @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "this reasoning leads to @xmath67 \\sim \\delta(e - v_b).\\ ] ] the advantage of using @xmath68/de$ ] over @xmath63 is that less data accuracy is required : a first derivative is much easier to do .",
    "@xmath65 is also a sum of everything : a very simple charged - particle detector can measure it @xcite . measuring @xmath60 requires a specialized recoil separator to separate evaporation residues ( er ) from the incident beam : er and fission for heavy systems .",
    "data for barrier distribution were presented by _",
    "g. montagnoli _ for @xmath69ca+@xmath69ca , by _ c.j . lin _ for @xmath70li+@xmath47pb , @xmath71bi and by _ a. trczciska _ for @xmath27ne+@xmath72ni ( see figure [ fig : bd ] ) .",
    "remarkable agreement between @xmath73/de$ ] and @xmath63 is seen in most data .",
    "_ montagnoli _ infers from her data that below the barrier , the log slope of the excitation function for @xmath69ca+@xmath69ca has a small plateau and starts again increasing at lower energies .",
    "_ a. trczciska _ concludes that for @xmath74ni the distribution has a clearly visible  structure \" ( figure [ fig : bd ] ) , whereas for heavier ni isotopes the structure is smoothed out ( for @xmath75ni partly , for @xmath76ni completely ) .      in figure [ fig:1 ]",
    "one notices that cc calculations do not quite reproduce the data , specially at deep sub - barrier energies .",
    "our colleagues are working hard to gather data and understand this phenomenon .",
    "cross sections need to be measured at very low energies , a real challenge for accelerator and detector development .",
    "as for theorists , there seems to be two main streams of thought .",
    "well , just one : do everything as usual , but modify what happens when nuclei come very close , below the touching distance .",
    "a popular story goes like this : build a potential from the m3y interaction ( there is a huge _ m3y fan - club _ out there ) .",
    "then claim that pauli principle ( quoting _ c. simenel _ : _ if you do not know what to ask , ask me about the pauli principle _ ) modifies the interior of the potential , decreasing its depth .",
    "this solves something , as m3y yields a too deep central part of the potential . in ref",
    "@xcite it was also shown that this procedure also reproduces the nuclear incompressibility and the fusion hindrance in @xmath51o+@xmath47pb deep sub - barrier fusion .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the way to explain fusion hindrance was to assume a neck formation and the onset of damping for distances smaller than the touching radius . in summary , below the touching distance , something weird ( _ damping is a sort of physics hidden under a knob _ ) happens , leading to fusion hindrance .    _",
    "claims that all @xmath77 fusion systems must have an @xmath78 factor maximum , because @xmath79 , when @xmath80 .",
    "makes sense .",
    "this is shown in the rightmost panel of figure [ fig : ji ] .",
    "as for @xmath81 ( most reactions in stars occur in this way ) there is no such requirement .",
    "usually the s - factors remain finite at @xmath82 . but as shown in the two left panels of figure [ fig : ji ] , this is not really the case : a proof that fusion hindrance also occur for @xmath81 fusion reactions . intriguing .",
    "he also reported a first evidence of an s factor maximum in the positive q - value system @xmath69ca+@xmath83ca .",
    "but no firm conclusion can be made about the nature of the @xmath78 factor maximum , which is limited by background levels .",
    "_ a. shrivastava _ reported that no hindrance was observed in the fusion of @xmath21li(@xmath24c)+@xmath84pt .",
    "adamian _ discussed theoretical methods to calculate sub - barrier capture using the _ quantum diffusion approach_. this method takes into account the fluctuation and dissipation effects in collisions which model the coupling of the relative motion with various channels .",
    "he claims that the effect of the change of fall rate of sub - barrier capture cross section should be in the data if we assume that the friction starts to act only when the colliding nuclei approach the barrier .",
    "but at extreme sub - barrier energies the experimental data still have large uncertainties to make a firm experimental conclusion about this effect @xcite .    _",
    "b. yilmaz _ claimed that a classical treatment of the relative motion is a good approximation at near - barrier energies .",
    "also , the quantal effects of the surface modes can not be neglected .",
    "but it is possible to include them within a semi - classical approximation . in this model ,",
    "the force on the nuclei follow the equation @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the nuclear orientation , @xmath87 is a friction coefficient and @xmath88 is a fluctuating force satisfying @xmath89 and @xmath90 , where the temperature @xmath91 is defined by the excitation energy .",
    "quantum fluctuations are allowed through the coupling to surface mode amplitudes @xmath92 .",
