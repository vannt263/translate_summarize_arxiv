    "feynman diagrams of the matrix models correspond to the dynamically triangulated surfaces and the continuum limit of the models then describe the theory of two - dimensional gravity .    due to the double scaling limit",
    "@xcite the sum of the contributions from all topologys of two - dimensional surface can be treated , and thereby the matrix models have been drawn much attention as a non - perturbative definition of non - critical string theories . following the discovery of the double scaling limit ,",
    "many important structures of the models have become clear ; for example , the connection to kdv flow @xcite , the virasoro and @xmath0 constraints @xcite . field theory of non - critical strings @xcite has been constructed based on the matrix models .",

    "this phenomenon can be understood as follows . in the kac table",
    "we can divide the primary fields @xmath6 into those which are inside the the minimal conformal grid @xmath7 and those outside , which correspond to the null states . before dressed by gravity ,",
    "the fields outside the minimal conformal grid decouple @xcite from physical correlators .",
    "after gravitational dressing , they cease to decouple @xcite and become infinite number of scaling operators .",
    "the similar phenomenon has been shown in continuum framework . through the examination of the brst cohomology of the coupled system composed of liouville theory , the ghosts and the minimal matter",
    ", infinite physical states were shown to exist @xcite .",

    "it was shown @xcite that these correlators have more information than those of local operators and that the latter correlators can be extracted from the former correlators explicitly in the case of @xmath13 .",
    "they argued there that macroscopic loops could be replaced by a sum of local operators in a certain situation and thereby obtained the correlators of local operators from those of macroscopic loops .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to generalize the idea in @xcite to the cases of the general unitary minimal models and to clarify the fusion rules for macroscopic loops and all of the scaling operators .",

    "the main conclusion is that the three - point correlators of all of the scaling operators satisfy certain simple fusion rules @xcite and the fusion rules for all of the scaling operators are summarized in a compact form as the fusion rules for three - loop correlators @xcite .    in matrix models ,",
    "there are infinite subset of the scaling operators which do not have their counterparts in the brst cohomology of liouville theory .",
    "in the case of one - matrix model , martinec , moore and seiberg @xcite argued that these operators are boundary operators , which correspond to the vertex operators of open string and couple to the boundaries of two - dimensional surface .",
    "they proved that one of them is in fact a boundary operator which measures the total loop length .",
    "we think , however , the roles of the rest of these operators were not clear",
    ". we also clarify the role of these operators and its connection to the touching of loops in the case of general unitary models @xcite .",
    "we also determine completely the forms of the multi - resolvent correlators , which are the laplace transform of the multi - loop correlators , and point out that the loop correlators have the structures similar to those of the crossing symmetry of the underlying conformal field theory @xcite . in the cases of four- and five - loop",
