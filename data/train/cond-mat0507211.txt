    "a linear resistance is predicted for three - dimensional electrons coupled to two - dimensional critical fluctuations.@xcite  furthermore , in the spin - density - wave scenario a strong increase of the general temperature dependence of the resistivity is expected close to the qcp due to scattering from a strongly increased amount of fluctuations of softened magnetic modes .",
    "we add that @xmath143 of ybagge does not saturate in measurements down to 0.4  k.@xcite this pattern of unconventional low - temperature resistivity and heat capacity has been observed a number of times in , e.g. , heavy fermion systems or weakly magnetic d - metals when approaching a zero - field qcp by changing the chemical composition or applying pressure .",
    "the observation of an nfl resistivity to low temperatures in a wide field region is unusual even in the context of field - induced quantum criticality .",
    "there are no indications for phase transitions at the high - field side of @xmath45 or @xmath128 and therefore the wide nfl range is not created by two nearby qcps",

    ", antiferromagnetic order at low magnetic fields suggests the importance of antiferromagnetic interactions in this material .",
    "the competition between internal antiferromagnetic interactions and the zeeman interaction is likely to be at the origin of enhanced critical fluctuations .",
    "currently , it is unclear by which model the spectrum of the critical fluctuations can be best described .",
    "apart from the spin - density - wave scenario the local character of the f - electrons might be important to categorise a qcp in ybagge taking into account the low kondo temperature @xmath19  k.@xcite  in this respect ybagge could turn out to be similar to cecu@xmath13au@xmath14 at its zero - field qcp , or similar to ybrh@xmath8si@xmath8 at its qcp near zero - field . there",
    "unconventional transport and thermodynamic properties are assigned to the strong localisation of the f - electrons in these systems.@xcite .",
    "we note the formal similarity in the phase diagram of ybrh@xmath8si@xmath8 and ybagge that a feature in the hall resistivity defines a line which originates from the critical field for the suppression of magnetism.@xcite  finally , frustration effects in the quasi - kagome planes might be a relevant ingredient to the fluctuation spectrum of ybagge .",
    "the fluctuation spectrum has to be studied directly by in - field neutron scattering measurements and in - field heat capacity measurements below 0.4  k to learn more about the nature of the low - energy excitations in ybagge .",
    "the impurity - level dependence of the size of the field range , where ybagge shows non - fermi - liquid resistivity , should also be investigated .",
    "the presented measurements of the field and temperature dependent resistivity of single crystals of hexagonal ybagge up to 14  t allow to extend the @xmath1 phase diagrams down to 70  mk .",
    "in particular , for the field applied along the crystallographic a - axis , the critical fields for the suppression of two antiferromagnetic phases have been determined to be @xmath145  t ,",
    "@xmath80  t. a further phase is suppressed at @xmath81  t. for the field applied along the crystallographic c - axis , critical fields for the suppression of phases , which show af1 order and af2 order at zero field , are @xmath124  t and @xmath126  t , respectively . in the low - field magnetically ordered phases the low - temperature dependence of the resistivity is generally characterised by a temperature exponent @xmath62 close to or above 2 . however , close and beyond the highest critical fields for both field directions unconventional exponents @xmath6 describe the low - temperature resistivity , before fermi - liquid behaviour is approached at high fields .",
