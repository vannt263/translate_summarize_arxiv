    "star - to - star abundance variations of the light elements c , n , o , na , mg and al have been observed in every well studied globular cluster ( gc ) to date ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) but are not found in field stars of the same metallicity @xcite . hence these abundance anomalies are somehow the result of the cluster environment . the variations of the elements follow a common pattern : c - n , o - na and mg - al are all anti - correlated @xcite .",
    "the abundances of iron - peak , s and r - process elements do not show the same star - to - star scatter nor do they vary _ with _ the light elements @xcite , although new observations by @xcite suggest that there is real star - to - star scatter amongst heavy element abundances in stars in the metal - rich cluster 47 tucanae .",
    "the other important exception is the massive cluster @xmath2 centauri , whose age and metallicity spread , along with a rise in s - element abundance with increasing [ fe / h ] , suggests that it evolved very differently from other gcs and may even have an extragalactic origin @xcite .",
    "the key points are that o has been destroyed in some stars by up to one dex , the c@xmath3n@xmath3o abundances remain almost constant and there is no evidence for large - scale variation of the neutron - capture elements .",
    "two hypotheses had been proposed to explain these observed abundances .",
    "the first was deep mixing , where the abundance anomalies are produced by internal mixing during the ascent of the giant branch , after the first dredge - up @xcite .",
    "however , star - to - star abundance variations in c , n , o and na were subsequently observed in stars at or near the main - sequence turn - off @xcite .",
    "these observations support the self - pollution scenario , first proposed by @xcite . here a previous generation of stars polluted the atmospheres of stars we observe today or provided part of the material from which those stars formed . because [ fe / h ] is roughly constant in stars in a given gc it has been assumed that polluters were intermediate - mass agb stars with initial masses between @xmath43 to 8@xmath5 rather than supernovae , which produce fe .",
    "the hot bottom burning experienced by these stars provides the hydrogen burning environment ( at least qualitatively ) that can alter the abundances of the light elements .",
    "one consequence is the production of a significant quantity of helium ( @xmath6 , he ; * ? ? ?",
    "the mass lost via the slow winds of agb stars could , in principle , have been retained by the cluster from which new stars may have been born @xcite .",
    "detailed agb models have so far mostly failed to match the observed abundance trends @xcite , but major uncertainties that affect the models undermine the reliability of the predictions and leave room for an agb solution @xcite .",
    "horizontal branch ( hb ) and main - sequence color - magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) @xcite provide increasing evidence for helium enrichment in some gc stars .",
    "the unusual hb morphology of ngc 2808 , which exhibits an extended blue tail and a gap separating the red and blue clumps @xcite , can be most easily explained if the blue stars have a higher helium content ( @xmath7 ) compared to those in the red clump which presumably have primordial @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , ngc 2808 also has a peculiar main sequence @xcite where the bluer stars are inferred to have @xmath9 from fitting theoretical isochrones to the observed data . to reproduce the cmd , @xcite note the absolute necessity of including a small population ( @xmath10% ) of stars with @xmath11 and assume a spread of @xmath6 between 0.24  0.29 to fit the main fraction ( @xmath12% ) .",
    "while the exact maximum value of @xmath6 required to reproduce the cmd is dependent on the color-@xmath13 transformations used in the analysis and therefore rather uncertain , it seems that the most plausible explanation is that the bluest stars have enhanced amounts of helium with @xmath14 .",
    "observations by @xcite show that the blue main - sequence of @xmath2 centauri is more metal - rich than the red sequence , contrary to what is expected from stellar models and @xcite showed that isochrones with @xmath15 best fit the bluest stars . until a better explanation for these intriguing observations is found , we take them as motivation to study the agb self - pollution scenario from a global perspective .    in this paper , we use the @xcite gc chemical evolution model to follow the evolution of helium in the intracluster gas .",
    "we probe agb model uncertainties by using two independent sets of yields , including those used in the previous study which were tailor made for ngc 6752 ( with a metallicity [ fe / h ] @xmath16 @xmath17 for ngc 6752 , m13 , m3 and @xmath2 cen with metallicities from @xcite ; ngc 2808 has [ fe / h ] @xmath18 . ] ) . the evolution of c , n and o is also followed since they impose important empirical constraints , i.e. c@xmath3n@xmath3o @xmath19 constant , that must be met by the model .",
    "prior to the agb both the first and second dredge - up ( sdu ) mix helium to the surface from regions that have undergone some h burning . during the thermally - pulsing - agb phase , partial he - burning results in an abundance of @xmath20 in the intershell region , and each third dredge - up ( tdu ) episode increases the he abundance of the envelope",
    ". hot bottom burning ( hbb ) also produces he via the cno cycle . for massive agb stars",
    "the most important mixing phase is the sdu which results in an increase of @xmath21 .",
    "the first dredge - up is inefficient in low-@xmath22 stars over 3@xmath5 ( see fig .  2 in @xcite ) , and efficient tdu and hbb result in small increases of at most @xmath23 , depending on the time spent on the agb and the temperature at the base of the convective envelope .",
    "the helium yields from the agb models with @xmath24 used by @xcite are shown in table  [ table1 ] as the average mass fraction of @xmath6 in the winds and the total mass of helium expelled into the intracluster medium by each model .",
    "we hereafter refer to the campbell et al .",
    "models as `` our '' models .",
    "we also show the @xmath25 yields from @xcite for comparison and note that the yields agree to within @xmath26% . our yields ( and average @xmath6 ) are systematically larger for @xmath27 , reflecting the different input physics used in the two computations .",
    "@xcite use a different convective model ( full spectrum of turbulence instead of the mixing - length theory ) and mass - loss rate , and observe shallower dredge - up . in table",
    "[ table1 ] an important result can be seen  the average @xmath6 from our models does not monotonically increase with increasing stellar mass but instead peaks at 5@xmath5 .",
    "we observe efficient tdu and hbb plus our models spend longer on the agb thanks to the @xcite mass - loss rate ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the models of @xcite have more efficient envelope convection resulting in larger luminosities and shorter agb lifetimes , owing to their choice of a luminosity - driven mass - loss rate @xcite .",
    "this results in smaller helium yields and consequently less helium in the cluster gas for the ventura et al . yields .",
    "this difference has important consequences for the chemical evolution model , discussed further in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "previously @xcite we compared the stellar yields from the monash models with those from @xcite and @xcite , for varying metallicities and find agreement for he for @xmath28 at the level of @xmath26% , with the exception of @xcite who produce @xmath29% less he .",
    "@xcite also observed that the final surface abundance of @xmath6 in the @xmath30 models ( slightly higher but similar to the average @xmath6 in the winds ) did not monotonically increase with mass but peaked at both @xmath31 ( owing to efficient tdu ) and @xmath32 ( due to hot bottom burning ) .",
    "we conclude that the relatively close agreement between helium yields from various studies indicates they are more robust than other species ( e.g. c and o ) .",
    "this is partly because the net result of hydrogen fusion is helium production regardless of the rates of the various internal cycles ( cno cycle , nena and mgal chains ) .",
    "the gc chemical evolution ( gcce ) model was described in detail in @xcite ; here we summarize the main features and the changes made for this study .",
    "we assume a two - stage formation model whereby the first stage acts as a prompt initial enrichment that brings the cluster gas up to a metallicity of [ fe / h ] = @xmath33 .",
    "this first stage assumes a bimodal top - heavy imf @xcite and zero - metallicity massive star yields from @xcite and @xcite .    during the second stage , we assume that the gc stars form in 10@xmath34 years from this low - metallicity gas compared to @xmath35 that we would get if we assumed scaled - solar initial abundances .",
    "we therefore shift the [ o / fe ] values from @xcite by a factor of 2.5 to account for this difference . ] . in @xcite ,",
    "the @xcite imf was adopted and it was assumed that the gc retained ejecta from stars with @xmath36 ; here we change to a standard salpeter - like imf @xcite and test the effect of different power - law slopes ( see  [ sec : imf ] ) .",
    "furthermore we also run separate simulations using the agb yields from @xcite for helium and the cno isotopes .",
    "these yields cover the mass range @xmath37 ; we extrapolate these yields to 2.5@xmath5 and 6.5@xmath5 and substitute in yields from @xcite for @xmath38 .",
    "we underline here that this extrapolation to higher mass renders uncertain the results obtained in terms of the maximum @xmath6 expected after 50 @xmath39 100 myr when using the @xcite yields .",
    "although , in this case the extrapolation should be fairly reasonable given that the yields are monotonic with mass . no contribution from type",
    "ia sne was included due to the observed uniform [ fe / h ] .",
    "we favor a scenario in which the next ( third ) generation of stars is assumed to _",
    "form _ out of this polluted gas rather than this gas accreting onto their surfaces .",
    "this is because observational evidence shows that there is no dilution of the surface abundances when stars move through the first dredge - up .",
    "the first dredge - up would mix the polluted envelope material with primordial material , yet no changes to o , na , mg or al abundances are observed at this stage @xcite .    in the gcce model",
    "we simply track the composition of the cluster gas as a function of time .",
    "hence the abundance of the gas reflects the continuous addition of agb material as stars of decreasing mass evolve and lose their envelopes via winds .",
    "we do not model the formation of the third stellar generation but we can speculate that star formation will lock up some of this gas in new stars at a rate ( and efficiency ) that does not use up all of the gas from the 6.5@xmath5 stars before the 6@xmath5 stars have added new material ( @xmath10 myr ) .",
    "this is going on star formation timescales for low - mass stars , which can be anything from @xmath40 myr during the proto - star phase to @xmath41 myr to reach the zero - aged main sequence @xcite .",
    "the imf is one of the most uncertain parameters of the gcce model .",
    "hints that the imf is not universal @xcite have come from observations of carbon - enhanced s - process - rich metal - poor stars @xcite , which suggest more s - process - producing agb stars were required at the earliest stages of galactic formation .",
    "observations of the present - day mass function for the arches cluster in the galactic center by @xcite suggest a turnover mass of @xmath42 , with a possible absence of low - mass stars .",
    "@xcite required a factor of @xmath43 more 4  7@xmath5 stars than produced by a salpeter - like imf to return the amount of helium required to form the number of blue hb stars in ngc 2808 .",
    "the lack of observational evidence for enhanced levels of s - process elements or carbon suggests that stars between 1  3@xmath5 are either not produced in significant numbers or they are ejected from the cluster .",
    "dynamical simulations of gcs suggest that top - heavy imfs result in larger velocity dispersions than when using a salpeter - like imf ( downing & sills , in preparation ) , and that cluster masses grow too large if the imf is normalized by the number of blue hb stars .",
    "simple analytical considerations led @xcite to conclude that the top - heavy imfs required to produce the postulated helium enrichment in @xmath2 cen would most likely result in the disintegration of the cluster . with these points in mind , we compute separate simulations with 1 ) a salpeter - like imf and 2 ) a top - heavy imf that increases the number of intermediate - mass agbs by a factor of 10 ; see figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "we hereafter refer to the top - heavy imf as `` ims - enhanced '' ( intermediate - mass star enhanced ) .",
    "in @xcite we present results from simulations that employ a power - law imf with slope of 0.3 .",
    "previously , @xcite conservatively assumed that at the end of the simulation the intracluster gas consists of about three parts agb ejecta to one part primordial material .",
    "if we think about this assumption in terms of @xmath6 , then we begin with an initial @xmath44 and after about 50 myr the most massive agb stars of @xmath45 start losing mass and hence we see an increase in @xmath6 to some value dictated by the maximum @xmath6 in the agb ejecta and the amount of dilution with primordial gas .",
    "the shape of the imf will also dictate when the @xmath6 peak is reached , where a standard salpeter imf will favor the contribution from lower mass agb stars that produce significant helium .",
    "the peak will be offset in time according to the lifetime of these stars ( @xmath46 ) and this is indeed the behavior we see in figure  [ fig2 ] ( a ) , where we show the time evolution of helium using the standard salpeter imf for both sets of yields . in the case with some dilution with primordial material ( the top panel _ a _ )",
    "the helium abundance is not predicted to exceed @xmath47 at any time , where our models predict a maximum @xmath48 and ventura et al.s @xmath49 , both lower than the inferred maximum helium ( @xmath50 ) in hb and blue main - sequence stars . in  [ sec : heprod ] we described that the helium abundance in our agb models does not monotonically increase with stellar mass , but instead peaks at @xmath51 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xcite yields are monotonic with mass so we expect a maximum @xmath6 at the slightly earlier times than when using our yields . from figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "we see that the maximum @xmath6 is reached in just over @xmath52 myr , reflecting the dominant contribution of stars with @xmath53 , favored both by the salpeter imf and by the amount of helium they produce .",
    "the difference in maximum @xmath6 between the sets of yields can be attributed to the different input physics as discussed in  [",
    "sec : heprod ] .",
    "one of the consequences of deep tdu is the production of c which is quickly converted to n by hbb at the base of the convective envelope . in figure  [ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ]",
    "we show the temporal evolution of c , n , and o ( on a @xmath54 scale ) as a function of the helium mass fraction . using a standard salpeter imf ( figure  [ fig3 ] )",
    "we see that the deep tdu observed in our models result in a @xmath55dex increase in c@xmath3n@xmath3o with most of this in the form of n , again reflecting the dominant contribution of intermediate - mass agb stars .",
    "the ventura et al .",
    "yields show a modest increase in c@xmath3n@xmath3o of only @xmath56  dex and oxygen has been destroyed by 0.3  dex in comparison to our results where we see little or no o depletion .",
    "the large increase in cno that the campbell et al .",
    "yields predict is not observed in gc stars whereas the small increase from the ventura et al .",
    "yields is probably within observational uncertainties .",
    "the results of the simulation using the ims - enhanced imf are shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "using our yields , we see a substantial increase in helium , @xmath57 , similar to the value required by isochrones @xcite to match the bluest hb and main - sequence stars of ngc 2808 and @xmath2 centauri .",
    "this increase is also accompanied by a 1  dex increase in cno although now there is a noticeable depletion of o by @xmath58  dex .",
    "the simulation using ventura et al .",
    "yields maintains a constant cno ( to within @xmath58  dex ) but in this case the maximum @xmath6 does not exceed 0.30 .",
    "importantly , the substantial o depletion of @xmath59 dex in this case is similar to the maximum dispersion observed in gc stars ( ignoring the case of the peculiar m13 , where the most o depleted stars with [ o / fe ] @xmath60 are likely the result of enhanced extra - mixing ) . if we compare with observations , the most `` polluted '' stars in a number of different clusters including m5 , m15 , m71 and ngc 6752 have [ o / fe ] @xmath61 @xcite whereas `` normal '' stars have [ o / fe ] @xmath62 , indicating significant o destruction of about 0.8  1 dex .",
    "the simulation with the ims - enhanced imf gives a higher weight to the most massive agb stars which tend to destroy o at the base of the envelope at temperatures @xmath63k .",
    "the dilution with primordial material only affects the smoothness of the resulting curve ( @xmath6 as a function of time ) and the maximum @xmath6 in the cluster gas . to check",
    "this is the case we compute two simulations with pure agb ejecta and no dilution at all , one for each set of yields .",
    "we show the results of these models in figure  [ fig2 ] ( b ) , where we show the evolution of @xmath6 , and in figure  [ fig5 ] , where we show evolution of the cno species as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath6 with mass is seen more clearly in these figures , where the simulation using our yields peaks at @xmath64 , similar to the maximum @xmath6 in the 5@xmath5 model .",
    "note also that @xmath6 keeps increasing after the first initial jump from 0.23 to 0.34 .",
    "the simulations using ventura et al . yields peak very sharply at @xmath65 before decreasing smoothly with time .",
    "the behavior of c@xmath3n@xmath3o is most interesting here .",
    "our models predict a significant increase of @xmath40 dex , as in the previous simulations with some dilution .",
    "the simulation using the ventura et al . yields now also show a large spread in c@xmath3n@xmath3o , varying by @xmath59 dex .",
    "this is because the diluted primordial gas is essentially nitrogen - free , off - setting increases from hbb .",
    "from the results presented in the previous section , it seems clear that the agb self - pollution scenario does not successfully match the observational constraints that we have considered in this study , namely that c@xmath3n@xmath3o is roughly constant and that the maximum @xmath50 . in no case , regardless of yields or the shape of the imf , were we able to simultaneously match these constraints .",
    "the maximum helium abundances inferred from theoretical modeling @xcite of the cmds are quite uncertain and we should give more weight to the spectroscopic observations showing c@xmath3n@xmath3o @xmath19 constant .",
    "we briefly consider the simulations that manage to fit this constraint .",
    "the simulations that most closely match the observed cno data are those employing the ventura et al .",
    "yields , regardless of the shape of the imf ( although see @xcite for models with a flat power - law ) , but with a small amount of dilution of primordial gas . note that some dilution is likely , since the star formation efficiency of low - mass stars is quite small , of the order of @xmath66% @xcite . even assuming a top - heavy imf such as the ims - enhanced imf used in our study , a low - star formation efficiency and _ no _ primordial material would make the job of producing enough polluted stars challenging .",
    "there are many stellar model uncertainties : in particular , the extent of the tdu is far from known and shallower dredge - up , as observed in the ventura et al .",
    "models , would help keep c@xmath3n@xmath3o constant while moderating the maximum @xmath6 .",
    "if this was combined with a long enough hbb lifetime , implying low agb mass - loss rates such as those obtained when using the @xcite prescription , then the required abundance patterns may be obtained by the essentially pure hbb environment .",
    "the hbb lifetime is also dependent on the convective model , and as shown by @xcite more efficient convection , coupled with a luminosity - driven mass - loss rate , results in a shorter agb lifetime .",
    "if abundances of the bluest stars are closer to @xmath67 , instead of @xmath9 then an agb self - pollution scenario , with a top - heavy imf , might work . how then to justify the existence of such an imf for the first generation of gc stars",
    "there is some observational evidence for variations in the imf @xcite but there is ample evidence supporting a universal imf , at least in the field @xcite .",
    "moreover , none of the observational evidence for variations in the imf comes from environments similar to galactic gcs .",
    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies have a total mass comparable to the largest clusters but supposedly did not have such strange imfs ( see for e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this may change as our ability to observe distant galaxies with young gcs increases , but it will be a great challenge to extract a useful mass function from these systems .",
    "our investigation into the chemical evolution of helium in gcs highlights the difficulty the agb self - pollution scenario suffers in trying to explain the large postulated helium enrichment required to fit the horizontal branch of clusters like ngc 2808 . with a standard salpeter imf , the largest predicted helium abundance in the cluster gas is @xmath48 but",
    "this is accompanied by a large increase in the c@xmath3n@xmath3o abundance . using an independent set of agb yields from @xcite we find a maximum @xmath49 and only a modest increase of c@xmath3n@xmath3o @xmath68  dex , probably within the observational errors .",
    "we conclude that with a standard imf it does not seem likely that the agb self - pollution mechanism alone produced the enormous amounts of helium inferred from observations of the bluest hb and main - sequence stars of clusters like ngc 2808 and @xmath2 centauri .",
    "simulations that employ the ims - enhanced imf show larger helium enhancements of @xmath57 but only when accompanied by enormous increases in the total c@xmath3n@xmath3o content of the cluster gas , in violation of observations .",
    "the ventura et al .",
    "yields predict a maximum @xmath69 and the total cno abundance stays constant to within @xmath58dex , although we again point out that this maximum @xmath6 is made uncertain by extrapolating the yields to higher masses .",
    "even with such an extreme imf we have a problem fitting the observational constraints . indeed ,",
    "the use of such an imf does not help the difficulties faced by the self - pollution scenario in matching the constraints that we have considered in this study i.e. @xmath50 and c@xmath3n@xmath3o @xmath19 constant . both sets of yields considered here also fail to match the observed spread of abundances between o , na , mg and al , even though the quantitative predictions of the models are different . for example , the fenner et al .",
    "models produce too much na whereas the ventura et al .",
    "yields destroy sodium , resulting in a o - na correlation .",
    "@xcite discussed the consequences of a number of top - heavy imfs on the evolution of @xmath2 centauri and concluded that the ones most suitable for producing the large helium enrichment would also tear the cluster apart . while @xmath2 cen is",
    "an unusual cluster indicated by the spread in fe , and clearly had a very different chemical enrichment history to the other lower - mass gcs , the conclusions reached about the top - heavy imf on the cluster evolution are applicable to smaller mass , less tightly bound systems .",
    "given the difficulties associated with the self - pollution scenario , we may need to look to other solutions such as pollution from outside the cluster . indeed , perhaps the most unusual of all clusters , @xmath2 cen , is actually just an extreme member and is telling us something useful about all gcs .",
