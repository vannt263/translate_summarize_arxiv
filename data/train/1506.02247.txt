    "this article is devoted to the study of the nonlinear integro - differential problem @xmath0 for @xmath1 .",
    "here , @xmath2 @xmath3 denotes an open and bounded set , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the _ range _",
    "kernel @xmath7 is given as a rescaling @xmath8 of a kernel @xmath9 satisfying the usual properties of nonnegativity and smoothness .",
    "we shall give the precise assumptions in section  [ sec.results ] .",
    "we shall refer to problem ( [ eq.orig])-([eq.orig2 ] ) as to problem p@xmath10 .",
    "the main results contained in this article are :    * theorem  [ th.existenceu ] .",
    "the well - posedness of problem p@xmath10 , the stability property of its solutions with respect to the initial datum , and the time invariance of the level set structure of its solutions . * theorem  [ th.equiv ] .",
    "the equivalence between solutions of problem p@xmath10 and the one - dimensional problem p@xmath11 , where @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the decreasing rearrangement of @xmath14 , see section  [ sec.dec_re ] for definitions .",
    "* theorem  [ th.pde ] .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the solution of problem p@xmath11 with respect to the window size parameter , @xmath15 , as a shock filter .    problem   is related to some problems arising in image analysis , population dynamics and other disciplines .",
    "the general formulation in ( [ eq.orig ] ) includes , for example , a time - continuous version of the neighborhood filter ( nf ) operator : @xmath16 where @xmath15 is a positive constant , and @xmath17 is a normalization factor . in terms of the notation introduced for problem",
    " the nf is recovered setting @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this well known denoising filter is usually employed in the image community through an iterative scheme , @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "it is the simplest particular case of other related filters involving nonlocal terms , notably the yaroslavsky filter @xcite , the bilateral filter @xcite , and the nonlocal means filter @xcite .",
    "these methods have been introduced in the last decades as efficient alternatives to local methods such as those expressed in terms of nonlinear diffusion partial differential equations ( pde s ) , among which the pioneering nonlinear anti - diffusive model of perona and malik @xcite , the theoretical approach of lvarez et al . @xcite and the celebrated rof model of rudin et al .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a review comparing these local and non - local methods .",
    "another image processing task encapsulated by problem   is the _ histogram prescription _ , used for image contrast enhancement : given an initial image @xmath14 , find a companion image @xmath22 such that @xmath22 and @xmath14 share the same level sets structure , and the histogram distribution of @xmath22 is given by a prescribed function @xmath23 .",
    "a widely used choice is @xmath24 , implying that @xmath22 has a uniform histogram distribution . in this case ,",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 is related to the image size and its dynamic range , see sapiro and caselles @xcite for the formulation and analysis of the problem .",
    "nonlinear integro - differential of the form @xmath27 and other nonlinear variations of it have also been recently used ( andreu et al .",
    "@xcite ) to model diffusion processes in population dynamics and other areas .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath28 is thought of as a density at the point @xmath29 at time @xmath30 and @xmath31 is thought of as the probability distribution of jumping from location @xmath32 to location @xmath29 , then @xmath33 is the rate at which individuals are arriving at position @xmath29 from all other places and @xmath34 is the rate at which they are leaving location @xmath29 . in the absence of external or internal sources",
    "this consideration leads immediately to the fact that the density @xmath22 satisfies the equation ( [ mazon ] ) .",
    "these kind of equations are called nonlocal diffusion equations since in them the diffusion of the density @xmath22 at a point @xmath29 and time @xmath30 depends not only on @xmath35 but also on the values of @xmath22 in a set determined ( and weighted ) by the space kernel @xmath36 .",
    "a thoroughfull study of this problem may be found in the monograph by andreu et al .",
    "observe that in problem  , the space kernel is taken as @xmath37 , meaning that the influence of nonlocal diffusion is spread to the whole domain .    as noticed by sapiro and caselles @xcite for the histogram prescription problem , and later by kindermann et al .",
    "@xcite for the iterative neighborhood filter ( [ def.gfv ] ) , or by andreu et al .",
    "@xcite for continuous time problems like ( [ mazon ] ) , these formulations may be deduced from variational considerations .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , the authors consider , for @xmath38 , the functional @xmath39 with an appropriate spatial kernel @xmath36 , and a differentiable filter function @xmath40 .",
    "then , the authors formally deduce the equation for the critical points of @xmath41 .",
    "these critical points coincide with the fixed points of the nonlocal filters they study .",
    "for instance , if @xmath42 and @xmath37 , the critical points satisfy @xmath43 which can be solved through a fixed point iteration mimicking the iterative neighborhood filter scheme ( [ def.gfv ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , choosing @xmath44 ( or some suitable nonlinear variant ) and considering a gradient descent method to approximate the stationary solution , equation ( [ mazon ] ) is deduced .",
    "similarly , @xmath45 and @xmath37 leads to the histogram prescription problem .    although the functional ( [ def.functional ] ) is not convex in general , kindermann et al .",
    "prove that when @xmath9 is the gaussian kernel then the addition to @xmath41 of a convex fidelity term , e.g. @xmath46 gives , for @xmath47 large enough , a convex functional @xmath48 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.1 ) .",
    "thus , the functional @xmath48 may be seen as the starting point for the deduction of problem  , representing the continuous gradient descent formulation of the minimization problem modeling gaussian image denoising .",
    "notice that although the convexity of @xmath48 is only ensured for @xmath26 large enough , the results obtained in this article are independent of such value , and only the usual non - negativity condition on @xmath26 is assumed .    the outline of the article is as follows . in section  [ sec.dec_re ] , we introduce some basic notation and the definition of _ decreasing rearrangement _ of a function .",
    "this is later used to show the equivalence between the general problem   and the reformulation p@xmath11   in terms of a problem with a identical structure but defined in a one - dimensional space domain .",
    "this technique was already used in @xcite for dealing with the time - discrete version of problem  , in the form of the iterative scheme ( [ def.gfv ] ) .",
    "see also @xcite for the problem with non - uniform spatial kernel .",
    "in section  [ sec.results ] , we state our main results .",
    "then , in section  [ sec.numerics ] , we introduce a discretization scheme for the efficient approximation of solutions of problem  , and demonstrate its performance with some examples . in section  [ sec.proofs ] , we provide the proofs of our results , and finally , in section  [ sec.conclusions ] , we give our conclusions .",
    "given an open and bounded ( measurable ) set @xmath2 , @xmath3 let us denote by @xmath49 its lebesgue measure and set @xmath12 . for a lebesgue measurable function @xmath50 , the function @xmath51 is called the _ distribution function _ corresponding to @xmath22 .",
    "function @xmath52 is , by definition , non - increasing and therefore admits a unique generalized inverse , called its _",
    "decreasing rearrangement_. this inverse takes the usual pointwise meaning when the function @xmath22 has not flat regions , i.e. when @xmath53 for any @xmath54 . in general , the decreasing rearrangement @xmath55 is given by : @xmath56 notice that since @xmath57 is non - increasing in @xmath58 , it is continuous but at most a countable subset of @xmath58 . in particular , it is right - continuous for all @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "the notion of rearrangement of a function is classical and was introduced by hardy , littlewood and polya @xcite .",
    "applications include the study of isoperimetric and variational inequalities @xcite , comparison of solutions of partial differential equations @xcite , and others .",
    "we refer the reader to the monograph @xcite for a extensive research on this topic .",
    "two of the most remarkable properties of the decreasing rearrangement are the equi - measurability property @xmath60 for any borel function @xmath61 , and the contractivity @xmath62 for @xmath63 , @xmath64 $ ] .    for the extension of the decreasing rearrangement to families of functions depending on a parameter ,",
    "e.g. @xmath65 $ ] , we first consider , for @xmath30 fixed , the function @xmath66 given by @xmath67 , for any @xmath68 . then we define @xmath69 by @xmath70 .",
    "our first result ensures the well - posedness of problem    for @xmath71 initial data with bounded total variation .",
    "in addition , we show that the level sets structure of the solution is time invariant . before stating our results ,",
    "we collect here the main assumptions on the data problem , to which we shall refer to as * ( h ) * :    * @xmath2 is an open , bounded , and connected set ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "* the final time , @xmath73 , which simulate the time horizon of the diffusion process is a real , positive fixed number . *",
    "the parameter @xmath26 is a real , nonnegative fixed number .",
    "* @xmath74 is nonnegative .",
    "* @xmath75 is assumed to be , without loss of generality , non - negative .",
    "basic facts but also advanced results about the space of bounded variation @xmath76 can be found in the book by ambrosio et al .",
    "notice that , depending on the space dimension @xmath77 we have the continuous injections @xmath78 . when @xmath79 we have @xmath80 .",
    "[ th.existenceu ] assume ( h ) .",
    "then there exists a unique solution @xmath81;{{\\cal x}})$ ] of problem . in addition , if @xmath82 and @xmath83;{{\\cal x}})$ ] are the corresponding solutions to problems @xmath84 then @xmath85 for some constant @xmath86 .",
    "finally , suppose that @xmath87 for some @xmath88 .",

    "the existence and stability results of theorem  [ th.existenceu ] may be extended to more general zero - order terms in the equation ( [ eq.orig ] ) of problem . for instance , we can consider a function @xmath91\\times\\o\\times{\\mathbb{r}}\\to{\\mathbb{r}}$ ] satisfying @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "this regularity coincides with the initially obtained for the integral term of equation ( [ eq.orig ] ) in the approximation procedure to construct the solution .",
    "in addition , if @xmath87 implies @xmath95 , then the time invariance of level sets holds .    replacing the set @xmath96 by @xmath97 and the initial data @xmath98 by @xmath99 , theorem  [ th.existenceu ] ensures the existence of a solution of problem p@xmath11 .",
    "observe that @xmath100 is bounded because @xmath2 is bounded ( assumption @xmath101 ) and this implies @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "in the following result we obtain some properties of solutions of the one - dimensional problem p@xmath104 .",
