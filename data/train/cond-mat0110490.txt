    "<S> these relaxation rates have contributions from different decoherence channels , their calculation from microscopic principles is difficult , and _ a priori _ there is no universal relation between them . </S>",

    "<S> we shall return to this dependence in the end of the paper .    </S>",
    "<S> the landau  zener transition , in the absence of inelastic events , is described by the unitary rotation of the density matrix : @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the amplitudes of the transition and of staying at the same adiabatic level , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> let us assume first that the reservoir temperature is much lower than the gap @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> then the inelastic relaxation processes may be described as attenuation of the amplitude of being in the upper energy state ( the case of higher reservoir temperatures will be discussed later , see eqs .  </S>",

    "<S> ( [ inelastic ] ) describes the probability flow into the lower state due to the inelastic decay . </S>",

    "<S> zener point produces the relative phase rotation of the upper and lower states : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the pauli matrix .    in this way </S>",
    "<S> , the evolution of the density matrix per one sweep is described by the master equation @xmath57    we parameterize the density matrix as @xmath58 the scalar part @xmath59 remains constant , as required by the normalization of the density matrix . </S>",
