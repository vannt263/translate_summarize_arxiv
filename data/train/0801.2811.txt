    "collider experiments ]    in @xmath6 collision experiments , the cross section for the two - photon processes @xmath7 , shown in fig.[fig : two - photon ] , dominates over other processes such as the annihilation process @xmath8 at high energies .",
    "in particular , the two - photon processes in the double - tag events , where one of the virtual photon is very far off shell ( large @xmath9 ) while the other is close to the mass shell ( small @xmath10 ) , can be viewed as deep - inelastic electron - photon scattering and provide us the information on the structure of the photon .",
    "the unpolarized ( spin - averaged ) photon structure functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 of the real photon ( @xmath13 ) have been studied in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "a pioneering work was done by witten @xcite in which he derived the leading order ( lo ) qcd contributions to @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "a few years later , the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections to @xmath14 were calculated @xcite .",
    "a unique and interesting feature of the photon structure functions is that , in contrast with the nucleon case , the target mass squared @xmath16 is not fixed but can take various values and that the structure functions show different behaviors depending on the values of @xmath17 .",
    "the photon has two characters : the photon couples directly to quarks ( pointlike nature ) and sometimes it behaves as vector bosons ( hadronic nature ) .",
    "thus the structure function @xmath11 of real photon ( @xmath18 ) is composed of a pointlike piece and a hadronic piece . the pointlike part , can be calculated , in principle , in a perturbative method . on the other hand , the hadronic part ,",
    "can only be computed by some nonperturbative method like lattice qcd , or estimated by vector meson dominance model .",
    "the lo contribution to @xmath11 , which behaves as @xmath19 , comes from the pointlike part , while the nlo corrections result from both the pointlike and hadronic parts . in terms of the moments ,",
    "the hadronic energy - momentum tensor operator comes into play at n = 2 . because of the conservation of this operator , the hadronic part gives a finite but perturbatively incalculable contribution at @xmath20 .",
    "the fact that definite information on the nlo second moment is missing prevents us from fully predicting the shape and magnitude of the structure function of @xmath11 up to the order @xmath21    the situation changes significantly when we analyze the structure function of a virtual photon with @xmath17 much larger than the qcd parameter @xmath22@xcite .",
    "more specifically , we consider the following kinematical region , @xmath23 in this region , the hadronic component of the photon can also be dealt with _",
    "perturbatively _ and thus a definite prediction of the whole structure function , its shape and magnitude , may become possible .",
    "in fact , the virtual photon structure function @xmath0 in the kinematical region ( [ kinematical ] ) was calculated in the lo ( the order @xmath24 ) @xcite and in the nlo ( the order @xmath25 )  @xcite , and the longitudinal structure function @xmath1 in the lo ( the order @xmath25 )  @xcite without any unknown parameters .    in this",
    "talk i report our investigation @xcite of the virtual photon structure functions @xmath0 up to the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) ( the order @xmath5 ) and @xmath1 up to the nlo ( the order @xmath5 ) in the kinematical region ( [ kinematical ] ) .",
    "we have used the framework of the operator product expansion ( ope ) supplemented by the renormalization group ( rg ) method .",
    "we find that the @xmath26-th moment of @xmath0 for the kinematical region ( [ kinematical ] ) is expressed , up to nnlo , as @xmath27\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad+\\sum_{i}{\\cal a}_i^n\\biggl [ 1-\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s(q^2)}{\\alpha_s(p^2)}\\right)^{d_i^n}\\biggr]\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad+\\sum_{i}{\\cal b}_i^n\\biggl [ 1-\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s(q^2)}{\\alpha_s(p^2)}\\right)^{d_i^n+1}\\biggr ] + { \\cal c}^n \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{-0.3cm}+\\frac{\\alpha_s(q^2)}{4\\pi}\\biggl(\\sum_{i}{\\cal d}_i^n\\biggl [ 1-\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s(q^2)}{\\alpha_s(p^2)}\\right)^{d_i^n-1}\\biggr]\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\sum_{i}{\\cal e}_i^n\\biggl [ 1-\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s(q^2)}{\\alpha_s(p^2)}\\right)^{d_i^n}\\biggr ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\sum_{i}{\\cal f}_i^n\\biggl [ 1-\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s(q^2)}{\\alpha_s(p^2)}\\right)^{d_i^n+1}\\biggr ] + { \\cal g}^n \\biggr ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{-0.3cm}+{\\cal o}(\\alpha_s^2 )   \\biggr\\},\\quad { \\rm with}\\quad i=+ , - , ns~ , \\label{master1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 denotes the eigenvalues of 1-loop anomalous dimension matrices .",

    "the explicit expressions of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are given in eqs.(2.34)-(2.37 ) of ref.@xcite and they are written in terms of the 1- , 2- and 3-loop anomalous dimensions , the 1- and 2-loop coefficient functions and the 1- and 2-loop photon matrix elements of hadronic operators .    for the 3-loop anomalous dimensions , we could use the recently calculated results of the three - loop anomalous dimensions for the quark and gluon operators  @xcite and of the three - loop photon - quark and photon - gluon splitting functions @xcite .",
    "the 2-loop photon matrix elements of hadronic operators were derived from the results of the two - loop operator matrix elements calculated up to the finite terms @xcite by changing color - group factors .",
    "we examine the sum rule of @xmath0 , i.e. , the second moment , numerically .",
    "the nnlo corrections are found to be @xmath38 of the sum of the lo and nlo contributions , when @xmath39 and @xmath40 or @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is three or four .",

    "the corrections are negative and the nnlo curve comes below the nlo one in the region @xmath53 . at the lower @xmath44 region , @xmath54 , the nnlo corrections to the nlo results are found to be negligibly small .",
    "the formula for the @xmath26-th moment of the longitudinal structure function @xmath1 can be obtained from ( [ master1 ] ) only by replacing the hadronic and photonic coefficient functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 with the longitudinal counterparts @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "since there is no contribution of the tree diagrams to the hadronic longitudinal coefficient functions ( and thus we get @xmath59 in the expansion of @xmath57 ) , the moments of @xmath15 starts at the order @xmath25 .",
