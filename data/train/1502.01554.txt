    "deviations from brownian motion are quite ubiquitous in a large variety of complex systems .",
    "mostly such anomalous diffusion processes are characterised by a scaling form of the mean squared displacement ( msd ) , @xmath3 the magnitude of the anomalous scaling exponent @xmath4 distinguishes subdiffusion for @xmath5 and superdiffusion @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "examples for anomalous include the relative diffusion of tracers particles in fully turbulent @xcite or weakly chaotic @xcite systems as well as in groundwater aquifers @xcite .",
    "subdiffusion of charge carriers in amorphous semiconductors was originally analysed some 40 years ago @xcite but is now regaining attention in the study of polymeric semiconductors @xcite .",
    "however , the main current impetus for the study of anomalous diffusion processes is due to modern spectroscopic tools such as fluorescence correlation spectroscopy @xcite and single particle tracking of submicron particles @xcite . by these methods pronounced deviations from normal diffusion ( @xmath7 ) were found in structured and crowded liquids @xcite and in living biological cells @xcite .",
    "similarly , anomalous diffusion is observed in supercomputer studies of , inter alia , flexible networks @xcite and lipid membranes @xcite .",
    "the non - brownian scaling of the msd of the tracer particles may originate from a range of physical mechanisms .",
    "these include the subdiffusive motion on geometric fractals such as percolation clusters close to criticality @xcite or the anomalous diffusion in lorentz gases @xcite . another important class of anomalous diffusion models are continuous time random walks ( ctrws ) , in which the test particle s motion is interrupted by random waiting times @xcite .",
    "if the distribution of these waiting times is scale free , subdiffusion emerges @xcite , a phenomenon closely related to quenched trap models with exponentially distributed trap depths @xcite .",
    "the third class represents processes , in which the particle is driven by fractional gaussian noise which is long range temporally correlated : the fractional brownian motion @xcite or associated fractional langevin equation motion @xcite are connected to viscoelastic environments and represent the motion of tagged monomers in a rouse chain @xcite or a tracer particle in a single file @xcite .",

    "@xcite .    here",
    "we deal with the remaining class of popular stochastic models , in which the diffusion anomaly stems from the explicit position or time dependence of the diffusion coefficient . modelling anomalous diffusion via a coordinate dependent diffusivity goes back to richardson s analysis of relative diffusion in turbulent flows with @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "systematic variations of the local diffusion coefficient in space were , for instance , demonstrated in the cytoplasm of living biological cells @xcite .",
    "a series of publications recently explored the stochastic properties of such heterogeneous diffusion processes ( hdps ) @xcite . instead of the position dependence ,",
    "batchelor introduced a time dependent diffusion coefficient for the description of richardson diffusion @xcite .",
    "scaled brownian motion ( sbm ) with a power law form for the diffusivity is very popular in the phenomenological description of anomalous diffusion @xcite .",
    "its stochastic properties were analysed in detail in refs .",
    "sbm was shown to grasp essential features of granular gases in the homogeneous cooling phase @xcite .",
    "physically , hdps and sbm are quite different : hdps are truly markovian processes ( with multiplicative noise @xcite ) while the time dependence of the diffusion coefficient in sbm already heralds its fundamentally non - stationary character .",
    "indeed experimentally it is often not possible to separate the effects of time and position variation of the diffusivity  compare , for instance , the data in ref .",
    "this poses the question how exactly the position and time dependence of the diffusion coefficient built into hdps and sbm conspire .",
    "how do they compete with each other ? on the level of the stochastic langevin we here analyse in detail generalised diffusion processes ( gdps ) with the position - time dependent diffusion coefficient @xmath9 where the physical dimension of the prefactor @xmath10 is @xmath11=\\mathrm{cm}^{2-\\alpha } \\mathrm{sec}^{-1-\\beta}$ ] .",

    "we also analyse the ageing behaviour and the effects of external confinement .",
    "we will discuss similarities and disparities with other anomalous stochastic processes .",
    "we start by introducing the physical observables , that we are going to analyse in the remainder of this work . the most standard quantity to classify",
    "a stochastic process is the msd ( [ msd ] ) , which is defined in terms of the spatial average @xmath12 over the available space region , where @xmath13 is the probability density function to find the test particle at position @xmath1 at time @xmath2 .",
    "this is typically a good measure when many short trajectories of tracer particles are available . in many single particle tracking experiments",
    ", however , few long time traces @xmath14 of length @xmath15 ( the measurement time ) are available .",

    "the increments are stationary , and the time averaged msd in the limit of long times becomes identical to the ensemble msd : @xmath20 @xcite . due to this identity",
    "we call brownian motion an ergodic process @xcite .",
    "the same is true for anomalous diffusion processes driven by fractional gaussian noise @xcite ( although pronounced transients may become relevant @xcite ) , as well as for diffusion on fractals @xcite .",
    "in contrast , non - stationary processes are subject to the disparity @xmath21 this behaviour is referred to as _ weak ergodicity breaking _ @xcite .",
    "for a range of anomalous diffusion processes , the time averaged msd in the limit @xmath22 was found to scale _ linearly _ in the lag time , @xmath23 despite the anomalous scaling of the ensemble msd ( [ msd ] ) .",
    "simultaneously , the explicit dependence on the measurement time shows that the process is progressively slowing down @xmath24 ) or picking up speed ( @xmath6 ) . the specific form ( [ web_tamsd ] )",
    "was derived , inter alia , for subdiffusive continuous time random walks @xcite , hdps @xcite , and sbm @xcite .",
    "we note that a similar linear lag time dependence of the time averaged msd was also observed in ultraslow processes with a logarithmic form of the ensemble averaged msd @xcite .",
    "ergodic processes are reproducible in the sense that each time we evaluate some observables for a  sufficiently long  measured time series we obtain the same result with only minor deviations . quantified in terms of the dimensionless variable @xcite @xmath25",
    "this means that the associated distribution @xmath26 converges to the delta function , @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "weakly non - ergodic processes have different limit distributions for @xmath28 .",
    "for instance , subdiffusive continuous time random walks have a finite value @xmath29 and a distinct contribution away from the ergodic value @xmath30 @xcite .",

    "as we show below the ergodicity breaking parameter ( [ eq - eb - via - xi ] ) is a sensitive measure for the physical processes generating a given anomalous diffusion process .",
    "other observables such as the ensemble and time averaged msds often feature similar or even identical functional forms for different processes and are thus not suitable to discern a specific process , compare the discussion in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , we address the ageing behaviour of the anomalous diffusion processes . this is the explicit dependence of physical observables on the ageing time @xmath36 elapsing between the initiation of the process at @xmath37 and the start of the measurement at @xmath36 .",

    "alternative power - law scaling of the form @xmath129 corresponding to different structures of the disorder in the system were also examined , @xmath130 often ranging in the interval @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath132 is known for a fully uncorrelated medium in three dimensions . in a biological context",
    ", the power @xmath130 of the tail of the diffusivity depends on the positioning of boundaries in the system .",
    "the latter are typically cell membranes that are only weakly permeable to water or ions .",
    "it was argued that some deceases may caused changes in the brain or muscle tissues that can be detected by measuring the changes in the time dependent diffusivity and the exponent @xmath130 as compared to healthy tissues .",
    "note that in these biological examples with time - dependent diffusivity no complete localisation of particles in the long - time limit exists and the basal diffusivity @xmath133 is finite .    in porous interconnected media , for instance , in a suspension of reflecting spheres @xcite ,",
    "the long - time diffusivity of a tracer can be defined as @xmath134 .",
    "it can again be represented in the time dependent form @xmath135 @xcite .",
    "the leading time dependence for the instantaneous diffusion coefficient is then @xmath136 . here",
    "@xmath137 is the tortuosity of the medium that renormalises the long - time tracer diffusivity due to the presence of inter - connected cavities @xcite .",
    "are such assumptions of an effective , time dependent diffusivity always justified ?",
    "in fact , any anomalous diffusion law ( [ msd ] ) can be interpreted in terms of the effective diffusivity @xmath138 , such that we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ msd ] ) in the form @xmath139 . however , this is not sufficient to identify the observation of anomalous diffusion with the gdp or sbm models studied here .",
    "it is important to either have more detailed knowledge of the underlying physical process , which may support the gdp approach or rather other physical models such as continuous time random walks @xcite . in particular , we note that despite many close similarities , sbm and fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) capture physically strongly different situations .",
    "if direct physical insight is not possible , the stochastic properties of the process need to be scrutinised in more detail by using complementary diagnostic tools @xcite .",
    "similar to these examples , position dependent diffusivities were explored in a range of systems including tracer diffusion in groundwater aquifers @xcite .",
    "the position dependence is directly accessible experimentally and was systematically sampled for the motion of smaller protein tracers in living biological cells @xcite .",
    "we note that hdp and sbm processes may also give rise to ultraslow diffusion with a logarithmic dependence of the msd . for the hdp this corresponds to an exponential variation of the diffusivity in space @xcite while for sbm ultraslow motion emerges in the limit @xmath140 @xcite .",
    "such ultraslow diffusion is equally weakly non - ergodic and ageing , in analogy to diffusion in ageing environments @xcite , diffusion in quenched sinai disorder @xcite , or many particle systems with scale free time evolution @xcite .",
