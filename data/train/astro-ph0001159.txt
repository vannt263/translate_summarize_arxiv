    "the rotation curves of spiral galaxies are typically flat out to about @xmath3 kpc .",
    "this implies that the mass enclosed increases linearly with radius , with a halo of dark matter extending beyond the luminous matter .",
    "the nature of the dark matter is unknown with possible candidates including massive compact halo objects ( machos ) such as brown dwarves , jupiters or black holes and elementary particles , known as weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , such as axions and neutrilinos [ 2 ] .",
    "machos with mass in the range @xmath4 to @xmath5 can be detected via the temporary amplification of background stars which occurs , due to gravitational microlensing , when a macho passes close to the line of sight to a background star [ 9 ] . since the early 1990s several collaborations have been monitoring millions of stars in the large and small magellanic clouds , ( lmc and smc ) , and a number of candidate microlensing events have been observed .",
    "the interpretation of these microlensing events is a matter of much debate . whilst the lenses responsible for these events may be located in the halo of our galaxy ,",
    "it is possible that the contribution to the lensing rate due to other populations of objects has been underestimated . for the standard ",
    "halo model , a cored isothermal sphere , the most likely macho mass function ( mf ) is sharply peaked around @xmath6 , with about half of the total mass of the halo in machos .",
    "this poses a problem for stellar macho candidates ( chemical abundance arguments and direct searches place tight limits on their abundance ) [ 2 ] , and leads to the consideration of more exotic macho candidates such as primordial black holes ( pbhs ) .",
    "pbhs with mass @xmath0 could be formed due to a spike in the primordial density perturbation spectrum at this scale or at the qcd phase transition , where the reduced pressure forces allow pbhs to form more easily [ 5 ] . in both cases",
    "it is not possible to produce an arbitrarily narrow pbh mf and the predicted mf is considerably wider than the sharply peaked mfs which have been fitted to the observed events to date [ 1 ] .",
    "in their analysis of their 2-year data the macho collaboration form a 6 event sub - sample which they argue is a conservative estimate of the events resulting from lenses located in the milky way halo [ 1 ] . we find the maximum likelihood fit , to the 6 event ` halo sub  sample ' , for df , power law and pbh mfs for four sample halo models : the standard ",
    "halo , the standard ",
    "halo including the transverse velocity of the line of sight and 2 power ",
    "law halo models [ 3 ] . for the standard  halo , both with and without the transverse velocity of the line of sight , and one of the power  law halo models , the df mf has the largest maximum likelihood , whilst for the other power  law halo the pbh mf provides the best fit .",
    "the differences in maximum likelihood between mf / halo model combinations are small and , unsurprisingly given the small number of events , it is not possible to differentiate between mfs using the current data , even if the halo model is fixed ( for more details see [ 4 ] ) .",
    "we carried out 400 monte carlo simulations each for @xmath7 and 3162 event samples , assuming a standard  halo and taking the macho mf to be the , comparatively , ` broad ' pbh mf .",
    "for each simulation we found the best fit pbh and delta - function ( df ) mfs .    for each simulation we compared the theoretical event rate distributions produced by the best fit pbh and df mfs with those ` observed ' using a modified form of the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test .",
    "the fraction of the simulations passing the ks test at a given confidence level , for both the pbh and df macho mfs , is shown in fig . 1 for each @xmath8 .    in fig .",
    "2 we plot 1 and 2 @xmath9 contours ( which contain 68% and 95% of the simulations respectively ) , of the mean macho mass and halo fraction , of the best fit pbh mfs .",
    "the values for the input mf are marked with a cross .",
    "we find that fitting a df mf when the true mf is the pbh mf leads to a systematic underestimation of the mean macho mass by @xmath10 . for further details see ref .",
    "assuming that the lenses are located in the milky way halo , and that the correct halo model is known , approximately 500 events should be sufficient to ascertain whether the macho mass function has significant finite width , and also determine the parameters of the mass function to @xmath2 .",
    "if the halo model is not known then the number of events necessary is likely to be increased by a least an order of magnitude [ 6 ] , however the use of a satellite to make parallax measurements of microlensing events would allow simultaneous determination of the lens location and , if appropriate , the halo structure and mass function with of order 100s events [ 7 ] .",
    "if the machos are pbhs then the gravitational waves emitted by pbh - pbh binaries will allow the macho mass distribution to be mapped by the laser interferometer space antenna [ 8 ] .",
