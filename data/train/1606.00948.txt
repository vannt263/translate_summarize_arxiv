    "a quadrangular embedding of @xmath0 is never polyhedral in this sense : if we take a face bounded by @xmath276 then the edge @xmath277 is part of the boundary of some other face , and using these two faces we can find a simple closed curve intersecting the graph at just @xmath71 and @xmath208 , which must be noncontractible .",
    "\\(2 ) we used diamond sums to prove the existence of nonorientable quadrangular embeddings of complete graphs .",
    "we could also use diamond sums to prove the existence of orientable quadrangular embeddings of complete graphs if we could find an orientable quadrangular embedding of @xmath278 , the graph obtained by subdividing one edge of @xmath279 , on @xmath280 .",
    "we could then prove a lemma analogous to lemma [ lem : nonorient ] , saying that if @xmath0 has an orientable quadrangular embedding then so does @xmath41 , and apply this starting from quadrangular embeddings of @xmath28 on @xmath281 and @xmath42 on @xmath282 .",
    "\\(3 ) we can carry out the graphical surface / voltage graph construction from the proof of theorem [ thm : orient ] with non - perfect matchings @xmath142 of @xmath15 as well as with perfect matchings , to give orientable and nonorientable quadrangular embeddings of some graphs @xmath231 with @xmath161 \\subseteq l \\subseteq g[k_4]$ ] .",
    "this provides some further results on minimal quadrangulations , but we omit the details .",
    "\\(4 ) our constructions have a lot of flexibility , particularly the constructions from subsection [ ss : graphical ] and section [ sec : oriquademb ] .",
    "the graphical surface embeddings of @xmath68 in @xmath69 ( with twisted tubes allowed ) require a cyclic order of tubes around the equator of each sphere , and a designation of which tubes are to be twisted .",

    "there are two ways to run the edges along each tube . for theorem [ thm :",
