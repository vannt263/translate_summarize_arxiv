    "the kondo - lattice model , which is the standard model for heavy - fermion systems , consists of a lattice of interacting localized spins or local moments coupled to conduction electrons @xcite . in a typical heavy - fermion material , the local moments are due to f - electrons , and the conduction electrons populate one or more separate bands .",
    "at least two physically distinct quantum phase transitions can occur in such a system as a function of the relative strength of the kondo coupling between the local moments and the conductions electrons on one hand , and the intra - local - moment coupling on the other .",
    "one is a transition from a magnetically ordered phase to a nonmagnetic one ; the other , a transition from an ordinary fermi liquid with a small fermi surface that is comprised of the conduction electrons only to a heavy fermi liquid with a large fermi surface .",
    "the latter transition is produced by a hybridization of the f - electrons with the conduction electrons @xcite .",
    "these two transitions are generically expected to be separate , but they may coincide in some materials . in most heavy - fermion materials",
    "the coupling between the local moments is antiferromagnetic @xcite , but over the years an increasing number of heavy - fermion metals have been discovered that display ferromagnetic order , see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "this raises the issue of a ferromagnetic quantum phase transition in these complex metallic systems .",
    "two obvious questions regarding this ferromagnetic transition are : ( 1 ) what are the properties of this transition ?",
    "in particular , is it continuous ( second order ) or discontinuous ( first order ) ?",
    "( 2 ) what happens to the fermi surface of the conduction electrons across the transition ?",
    "if the hybridization transition that delocalizes the f - electrons coincides with the ferromagnetic transition , then the latter will be accompanied by a concurrent transition from a small fermi surface to a large one , or vice versa @xcite ; otherwise , there will be a succession of magnetic and hybridization transitions .",
    "in this paper we answer the first question : the transition is first order .",
    "we will comment on the second question in the discussion , sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] .",
    "the ferromagnetic quantum phase transition in metals in general has an even longer history than the kondo effect , going back to stoner s mean - field theory @xcite .",
    "hertz @xcite used itinerant ferromagnets as an example for his more general theory of quantum phase transitions .",
    "he concluded that the ferromagnetic quantum phase transition in clean metals is continuous and mean - field like in all dimensions @xmath0 .",
    "it later became clear that this conclusion is not correct @xcite .",
    "the problem lies in soft or gapless particle - hole excitations in the conduction - electron system that couple to the magnetic fluctuations .",
    "hertz theory takes this coupling into account in an approximation that correctly describes landau damping , but is not sufficient for correctly describing the nature of the magnetic quantum phase transition . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the zero - temperature ( @xmath1 ) transition in a clean ferromagnet in dimensions @xmath2 and @xmath3 is _ generically _ first order @xcite .",
    "the physical mechanism behind this conclusion is in many ways analogous to the well - known fluctuation - induced first - order transition in superconductors and liquid crystals @xcite , with the soft fermionic excitations playing the role of the photons ( in the case of superconductors ) or the nematic goldstone mode ( in the case of liquid crystals ) .",
    "an important difference , however , is that the ( fictitious ) quantum ferromagnetic transition in the absence of any coupling to the conduction electrons , which is described by hertz theory , is above its upper critical dimension @xmath4 , as opposed to the transition in a superconductor or liquid crystal , which is below its upper critical dimension @xmath5 . as a result",
    ", the fluctuation - induced first - order transition in quantum ferromagnets is expected to be much more robust again order - parameter fluctuations than its classical counterparts @xcite . at @xmath6",
    "the fermionic soft modes acquire a mass , the fluctuation - induced first - order transition becomes weaker , and with increasing temperature a tricritical point appears in the phase diagram above which the transition is continuous and belongs to the applicable classical universality class @xcite .",
    "the initial theory of the first - order quantum phase transition @xcite was for itinerant ferromagnets .",
    "it was later shown that its conclusions hold much more generally and apply to clean metallic ferromagnets irrespective of whether the ferromagnetism is due to the conduction electrons , or due to electrons in a separate band , and even to ferrimagnets and magnetic nematics @xcite .",
    "this generalization of the theory is important , since many systems in which a discontinuous ferromagnetic quantum phase transition is observed are not itinerant ferromagnets @xcite .",
    "it also raises the question whether kondo lattices , with their complicated interplay between kondo physics and magnetic order , are different in this respect from other metallic quantum ferromagnets .",
    "mean - field approaches @xcite generically ( i.e. , for a simple band structure ) yield a second - order transition , although special features in the density of states can lead to a first - order transition @xcite .",
    "a second - order transition also is implicit in the renormalization - group ( rg ) analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we show that these analyses gave the wrong answer for the order of the transition for the same reason as hertz theory , and that a careful consideration of conduction - electron fluctuations leads to a first - order transition , as it does in all other metallic quantum ferromagnets .",
    "in the general kondo - lattice problem the local moments are coupled to each other by an exchange coupling @xmath7 that can be either antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic .",
    "we are interested in the latter , so we take @xmath8 .",
    "similarly , the coupling @xmath9 between the local moments and the conduction electrons can have either sign .",
    "as we will see , the order of the ferromagnetic transition is independent of the sign of @xmath9 , although the physics related to kondo screening and the hybridization of f - electrons and conduction electrons crucially depend on it . for our purposes we thus do not specify the sign of @xmath9 for now and will come back to this issue in the discussion .",

    "physically , such a term describes the bloch precession of the local moments , and therefore it must also be present in the soft - spin or lgw formulation of the action @xmath35 given above .",
    "however , the coupling to the fermions produces other dynamical terms , the most important of which is the landau - damping term which , in fourier space , takes the form @xcite s_^[m ] = -_k , m(k , ) ( / ) ( -k,- )  .",
    "[ eq:5 ] this term dominates the berry - phase term , as well as other dynamical terms generated by the coupling between the order parameter and the fermions .",
    "this is true both in the paramagnetic phase and at any putative quantum critical point , irrespective of the nature of the quantum phase transition , as is obvious from power counting . as we will show below",
    ", the ferromagnetic quantum phase transition is actually first order , which can be established without considering any dynamical term in @xmath35 .",
    "the fermionic sector is described by a standard action @xmath36 for a fermi liquid . @xmath37 and @xmath38 are fermionic spinor fields , and @xmath36 consists of a term bilinear in @xmath39 and @xmath38 that describes band electrons with electron - momentum relation @xmath40 , and four - fermion terms that describe the electron - electron interaction .",
    "the latter contains in particular a spin - triplet interaction of the form [ eqs:6 ] s_^t = _ t dx  n_s(x ) _",
    "s(x )  . [ eq:6a ] here _",
    "s(x ) = |(x)(x ) [ eq:6b ] is the electronic spin density , and @xmath41 is the spin - triplet interaction amplitude , which for simplicity we consider static and point - like .",
    "since we are not interested in systems where the conduction electrons by themselves develop magnetic order , we assume that @xmath41 is small enough for the system to not be an itinerant ferromagnet .",
    "if one aims to construct a complete effective field theory one can express the fermionic degrees of freedom in terms of bosonic ones that are isomorphic to bilinear products of @xmath39 and @xmath38 , and that capture the soft modes in the fermion sector @xcite .",
    "this would be the preferred strategy if one wanted to perform a systematic rg study of the effective field theory , since the renormalization of the fermionic sector is rather involved if it is formulated in terms of fermionic fields .",
    "however , it turns out that , remarkably , one can establish the first - order transition of the ferromagnetic quantum phase transition by using established properties of fermi liquids without an explicit formulation of the fermionic sector .",
    "( deriving these properties in the first place does , of course , require an explicit formulation . )",
    "we therefore do not dwell on the detailed form of the fermionic sector of the effective field theory .",

    "[ eq:7 ]      we now define an effective order - parameter action by formally integrating out the fermions .",
    "the partition function then takes the form [ eqs:8 ] z = d[m ]  e^s_[m ]  , [ eq:8a ] where we have defined s_[m ] & = & s_[m ] + d[| , ]  e^s_[| , ] + s_c[|,;m ] + & = & s_[m ] + s[m ]  .",

    "this can be done by treating the order parameter in a mean - field approximation . in the current context , this amounts to replacing the fluctuating magnetization @xmath43 by an @xmath44-independent magnetization @xmath45 that we take to point in the 3-direction .",
