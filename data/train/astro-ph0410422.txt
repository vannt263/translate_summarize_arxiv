    "low mass stars are the most populous objects in our galaxy , comprising roughly 70@xmath5 of the stars in the solar neighborhood and almost half of the galactic stellar mass [ @xcite ] . until the last decade , the low luminosities of these stars prevented their study by large scale spectroscopic surveys .",
    "however , efforts such as the palomar / msu nearby star spectroscopic survey [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] , 2mass followup [ @xcite ; @xcite ] , and nltt followup [ @xcite , @xcite ] have characterized global properties of nearby m dwarfs with samples numbering @xmath6 1000 objects .",
    "recently , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) has made it possible to study spectroscopic samples approaching 10,000 low mass stars [ @xcite ] .",
    "in particular , these surveys have provided insight into the magnetic behavior of low mass stars .",
    "there are many diagnostics by which a star may be deemed magnetically active , including x - ray and fuv emission lines , but in optical wavelengths , h@xmath3 is the most readily available signature of activity .",
    "although h@xmath3 in either emission or absorption may indicate the presence of a chromosphere , most large - scale optical studies have used the more restrictive definition of h@xmath3 in emission .",
    "this practice is due to the difficulty in breaking the degeneracy between intermediate activity and truly weak chromospheres , both of which present as weak h@xmath3 absorption ( see @xcite and @xcite for a discussion of this phenomenon ) . in this paper",
    "we use `` active '' to mean the presence of h@xmath3 in emission .",
    "increasingly large studies of active m dwarfs have built on one another to create our current picture of activity at the bottom of the main sequence .",
    "originally , @xcite showed a rise in the fraction of active m dwarfs towards later spectral types , with 100@xmath5 of m5 stars showing activity .",
    "the pmsu investigation of @xcite extended the trend with much better statistics , and found that the fraction of active stars peaked at @xmath760@xmath5 at spectral type m5.5 .",
    "@xcite observed a sample of later type stars from 2mass , and found that the incidence of activity rose to 100@xmath5 at type m7 , but declined at later types .",
    "@xcite added additional late m and l dwarfs to the sample and confirmed that the active fraction decreases past type @xmath7m7 - m8 .",
    "most recently , @xcite used a much larger sample of low mass dwarfs from sdss to further refine the trend : these data reveal a curiously elegant bell curve distribution for the incidence of magnetic activity in low mass stars .",
    "the fraction peaks at @xmath773@xmath5 of m8 stars being active .",
    "several of these studies consider the strength of activity , which is quantified as the ratio of the luminosity in h@xmath8 to the bolometric luminosity .",
    "the activity strength remains relatively constant ( though with large scatter ) at log(l@xmath0/l@xmath1 ) @xmath7 - 3.7 through the early to mid- m spectral types , and appears to decline at types later than m6 , while the active fraction is still rising .",
    "the increasing fraction of active stars may be an age effect ( lower mass stars retain their activity longer ) on the rising branch ( m0 - m8).the activity strength results indicate that some damping mechanism apparently sets in around type m6 . at types",
    "later than m8 , this damping mechanism [ possibly related to the atmospheric temperature , see @xcite ] overwhelms the age effect and results in fewer active dwarfs at lower atmospheric temperature .",
    "the activity fraction and activity strength results , taken together , provide important constraints on models of magnetic dynamos and magnetic field production in m and l dwarfs , particularly as these objects span the mass range where the stars become fully convective and develop degenerate cores .    quantifying the strength of activity as the ratio between h@xmath8 luminosity and bolometric luminosity , while informative ,",
    "is prone to systematic error .",
    "determining luminosities depends on having well - known distances , and as samples get larger ( e.g. from sdss ) the stars are typically well beyond the immediate solar neighborhood ( i.e. @xmath9 25pc from the sun ) .",
    "thus , precise trigonometric parallax measurements are generally not available as in previous local surveys . in principle",
    ", one should be able to calculate the ratio l@xmath0/l@xmath1 and expect the distance dependencies to cancel .",
    "however , in order to get l@xmath1 , one must have determined m@xmath1 , which relies on knowing m@xmath10 , having excellent color measurements , and a reliable bolometric correction .",
    "m@xmath10 generally comes from distance estimates based on spectroscopic and/or photometric parallax determinations , which are not always reliable or in agreement , due primarily to a paucity of calibration data at the bottom of the main sequence .",
    "calculating l@xmath0 , on the other hand , relies on knowing the flux in the continuum near h@xmath3 .",
    "this is often obtained from the photometric colors [ @xcite ] .",
    "alternatively , it may be measured directly from spectrophotometrically calibrated data .",
    "neither method is necessarily congruous with that used to obtain l@xmath1 .",
    "thus , in practice , the ratio usually contains two distances , typically determined in different ways , leading to possible systematic error .    an alternative method is to determine the ratio of the flux in the continuum near h@xmath8 and the bolometric flux .",
    "this ratio , which we call @xmath2 , can then be multiplied by the equivalent width in h@xmath3 for a given star to give the ratio l@xmath0/l@xmath1 .",
    "if one has excellent quality data , the ratio f@xmath4/f@xmath1 may be calculated for each of the stars observed . in this paper",
    ", we use a well - observed sample of nearby m dwarfs and early l dwarfs to determine @xmath2 as a function of several colors ( i@xmath11-k@xmath12 , v - i@xmath11 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) and of spectral type , in effect providing an improved `` bolometric correction '' for low mass dwarfs .",
    "we drew our sample of calibrating stars for early spectral types ( m0.5 to m6.5 ) from the nearby 8 parsec sample [ @xcite ; @xcite , appendix a ; @xcite , @xcite ] and used a sample of cool standard stars from 2mass for later spectral types ( m4.5 to l0 ) [ @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "the overlap of the two samples at midrange spectral types ( m4.5-m6.5 ) ensured that there were no systematic differences in f@xmath4/f@xmath1 for the two samples .",
    "the 8 parsec sample has been well - characterized photometrically ( in the ubvr@xmath11i@xmath11 johnson - cousins filters as well as near - infrared j , h , and k filters ) and spectroscopically .",
    "spectra for the 8 parsec sample were largely obtained using the spectrograph on the palomar 60 inch telescope with a 600 l / mm grating , blazed at @xmath15 6500 , giving a dispersion of 1.5 @xmath16 pix@xmath17 and coverage from @xmath76200 to 7400 @xmath16 .",
    "a 1 arcsec slit was used , giving a resolution element of @xmath72.5 pixels .",
    "most stars fainter than v=16 were observed using the double spectrograph on the palomar 200 inch hale telescope using the 6800 dichroic as a beam splitter , with the blue camera set to cover @xmath156200 - 6800 at a resolution of @xmath70.55 @xmath16 pix@xmath17 and the red camera covering @xmath15 6900 - 7500 at @xmath70.6 @xmath16 pix@xmath17 .",
    "a 1 arcsec slit gives resolution of @xmath73 pixels .",
    "many of the 2mass standards were observed using the low - resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ) on the keck i 10 m telescope on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "the 1200 l / mm grating , centered at @xmath15 = 6800 @xmath16 , yielded coverage from @xmath156120 to 7500 at 0.5 @xmath16/pixel . with a 1 arcsec slit , this gave a resolution of 1.5 @xmath16 .",
    "visible photometry for the sample of late spectral types was not readily available , so i@xmath11 magnitudes were found by convolving the spectra with a cousins i@xmath11 filter response curve .",
    "infrared magnitudes for the late type objects were obtained from the 2mass database .",
    "all spectra for the objects in our sample were spectrophotometrically calibrated in the region near h@xmath3 .    the method to find",
    "@xmath2 is straightforward .",
    "photometric data for the 8 parsec sample were used with the bolometric corrections of @xcite to find apparent bolometric magnitudes for the sample .",
    "the bolometric magnitudes , m@xmath1 , were then transformed to apparent bolometric fluxes , f@xmath1 .",
    "the values of the apparent continuum flux near h@xmath8 , f@xmath4 , defined as the mean between 6555@xmath16 and 6560@xmath16 , were measured directly from the calibrated spectra . for the late - type stars ,",
    "the spectra were convolved with a cousins i@xmath11 filter response , and k@xmath18 ( the short k filter used by 2mass ) was transformed to k@xmath19 ( using relations from @xcite ) for use in the bolometric correction relations .",
    "bolometric corrections were calculated using the @xcite relation in i@xmath11-k@xmath19 , which is more reliable for late spectral types .",
    "bolometric fluxes were computed as for the earlier spectral types , and continuum fluxes at h@xmath3 were measured directly from the spectra . combining the samples , we obtain @xmath2 = f@xmath4/f@xmath1 over the entire spectral range .",
    "the mean values of @xmath2 by spectral type are shown in table [ tbl-1 ] , while specific values for each object in the sample are given in table [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the data and fit to @xmath2 in i@xmath11 - k@xmath12 and v - i@xmath11 , and equations 1 and 2 provide the fits explicitly .",
    "comparison in the overlap region of m4.5 v to m6.5 v shows no difference in the behavior of @xmath2 for the two samples .",
    "we are particularly interested in being able to use @xmath2 with our large sample of sdss spectra .",
    "unfortunately , transformations between the sdss filter system and other common astronomical systems do not extend into the very red color range we require here . to address this problem , we computed fits between average colors by spectral type in traditional and sdss filters .",
    "these fits were used to transform the colors for our sample onto the sdss system . in the following section , figure [ fig2 ]",
    "shows the color transformations used , while equations 3 and 4 provide the relations .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the @xmath2 results for the sdss @xmath13 and @xmath14 colors , and the fits are given in equations 5 and 6 .",
    "equations 7 through 10 and figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] provide fits to f@xmath1 in terms of i@xmath11 , k@xmath12 , i@xmath11 - k@xmath12 and @xmath14 , for use by anyone wishing to obtain , for example , l@xmath20/l@xmath1 for a large sample of stars .",
    "after having obtained @xmath2 across the spectral range , we computed the best fit to the distribution as a function of color .",
    "fits to @xmath21 in v@xmath22i@xmath11 and i@xmath23k@xmath12 are presented below .",
    "mean values for @xmath2 were computed for each spectral type , as shown in table [ tbl-1 ] , enabling an estimate of an object s @xmath2 value in the event color data are not readily available or can not be synthesized .",
    "the relationship between @xmath21 and color can be expressed by the polynomials :    @xmath24 for ranges in color 1.89 @xmath25 i@xmath26 @xmath25 5.12 , and 1.91 @xmath25 v@xmath27 @xmath25 4.40 , respectively .",
    "obtaining fits in terms of sdss filters was somewhat more complicated .",
    "we computed transformations between traditional and sdss colors using average colors by spectral type .",
    "the fits between sdss and cousins-2mass colors , @xmath13 to v@xmath27 and @xmath14 to i@xmath26 , are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the fits obtained are : @xmath28    using these relations , we transformed our sample onto the sdss system , and obtained fits to @xmath21 in terms of @xmath29 and @xmath30 : @xmath31 for ranges in color 0.92 @xmath25 @xmath29 @xmath25 2.27 , and 0.47 @xmath25 @xmath30 @xmath25 2.00 , respectively .",
    "in addition , we also provide fits to f@xmath1 as a function of i@xmath11 , k@xmath12 , i@xmath11 - k@xmath12 and @xmath30 for our full sample : @xmath32",
    "in order to study the strength of magnetic activity as a function of spectral type , we require a distance - independent way of determining the ratio l@xmath0/l@xmath1 .",
    "we used a sample of nearby stars and cool standards from 2mass , spanning spectral types m0.5 to l0 , with ranges in color 1.89 @xmath25 i@xmath26 @xmath25 5.12 , and 1.91 @xmath25 v@xmath27 @xmath25 4.40 . for the 8 parsec sample stars , we obtained the bolometric flux from photometry combined with bolometric corrections . for the 2mass standards ,",
    "optical photometry was obtained by convolving the spectra with filter response , then bolometric corrections were applied .",
    "the flux in the continuum near h@xmath3 was obtained directly from the spectra . in both cases , we computed sdss photometry for the sample using color transformations , provided in section 3 .",
    "we then found the ratio @xmath2 = f@xmath4/f@xmath1 . in section 3 , we provided fits to @xmath2 as a function of color ( v - i@xmath11 , i@xmath11 - k@xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) .",
    "table 1 gives average @xmath2 values at each spectral type in the event photometry is not available , while table 2 provides @xmath2 values for all stars in our sample .",
    "@xmath2 may be multiplied by the measured equivalent width in h@xmath3 for a given star to yield the activity strength ratio , l@xmath0/l@xmath1 . if the reader possesses excellent quality data , the method described here",
    "may also be used to calculate f@xmath4/f@xmath1 for individual program stars .",
    "this method has already yielded cleaner results for activity strength calculations in @xcite , better illuminating trends in magnetic behavior at the end of the main sequence .",
    "improved color transformations and a larger sample of stars with well - calibrated photometry and spectra are required to reduce the scatter in these relations .",
    "we thank i. neill reid for providing data for the 8pc sample and late - type objects from 2mass .",
