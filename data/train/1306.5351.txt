    "this theory , however , has resisted a more conceptual and cohomological interpretation .",
    "associated to @xmath1 there is a canonical ideal which encodes the equivalences of divisors on @xmath1 .",

    "these integers encode very subtle numerical information about the module @xmath20 .",
    "many invariants of @xmath20 ( e.g. its hilbert series ) can be computed using these betti numbers .",
    "there is a standard way to write down a complex of graded modules from a cell complex @xmath31 .",
    "namely , one can label @xmath32-dimensional cells of @xmath31 by monomials , and then extend the labeling to arbitrary faces by labeling each face @xmath33 with the least common multiple of the monomial labels on the vertices in @xmath33 .",
    "the resulting labeled cell complex leads to a complex of free graded @xmath18-modules @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the monomial label of the face @xmath33 .",

    "this construction is so general that the resulting complex is expected not to be exact . in the rare case that we do get an exact sequence , the pair @xmath42",

    "polyhedral cellular free resolution_. if moreover all @xmath43 appearing in the differential maps are non - units in @xmath18 , then we have a _ minimal polyhedral cellular free resolution_.      our first goal is to give a minimal polyhedral cellular free resolution for the ideal @xmath15 . quite surprisingly , many ideas from potential theory on graphs , from lattices and delaunay decomposition , and from ( a generalized version of ) the notion of total unimodularity ( developed in  [ sec : divisors ] and  [ sec : latticesec ] ) fit together nicely to give a direct and self - contained solution to this problem",
    "this is worked out in  [ sec : igresol ] .",
    "note that as a result we obtain a whole family ( as @xmath1 varies ) of ideals with minimal polyhedral cellular free resolution . for complete graphs",
    "this is the scarf complex and for trees this is the koszul complex .",
    "we then step back and define two more ideals ; the _ graphic lawrence ideal _ @xmath44 and one of its initial ideals @xmath45 ( defined after fixing a vertex ) , which we call the _ graphic oriented matroid ideal_. these are special classes of more general ideals studied in @xcite and @xcite . they are intimately related to _",
    "graphic hyperplane arrangements _ and to _ delaunay decomposition of cut lattices _ reviewed in  [ sec : arrg ] . in ",
    "[ sec : matroidlawrence ] we take a close look at these ideals , review some general known results , and prove some new results for our special situation .    roughly speaking , the ideals @xmath44 and",
    "@xmath45 can be thought of as `` orientation '' variants of the `` divisor '' ideals @xmath15 and @xmath14 .",
    "a powerful technique in the theory of divisors on graphs and chip - firing games is to relate divisors to orientations .",
    "given an orientation , one can form a divisor by reading off the associated indegrees or outdegrees ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2.3 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  3.3 ) , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "our next main result shows that , algebraically , there is a good justification for the strength of this method .",
    "we show that the relation between the ideals @xmath44 and @xmath15 ( and similarly @xmath45 and @xmath14 ) can be understood via _",
    "regular sequences_. this is the content of  [ sec : reg ] and  [ sec : main ] .",
    "these regular sequences allow us to compare many algebraic properties and constructions for the ideals @xmath44 and @xmath15 ( and similarly @xmath45 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "for example , one immediate corollary is to obtain a minimal polyhedral cellular free resolution for the ideal @xmath15 from a minimal polyhedral cellular free resolution for the ideal @xmath44 .",
    "this resolution is essentially equivalent to the one obtained by our potential theoretic considerations ( see remark  [ rmk : resolrelation ] ) .",
    "we also obtain a minimal polyhedral cellular free resolution for the ideal @xmath14 from a minimal polyhedral cellular free resolution for the ideal @xmath45 .",
    "it follows that all these resolutions are closely related to delaunay decompositions of the lattice of integral coboundaries ( which we call the _ integral cut lattice _ ) and to the graphic hyperplane arrangement .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0-graded betti numbers of all these ideals coincide .",
    "so @xmath14 and @xmath45 are examples of `` nice '' initial ideals in the sense of @xcite , meaning that one can read the betti numbers of the original ideal from the initial ideal ( see @xcite for some results in this direcrtion ) .",
    "also , we obtain , automatically , an interpretation of the betti numbers in terms of the number of faces of various dimensions in the graphic hyperplane arrangement , or equivalently , the number of orbits of the delaunay cells of various dimensions in the cut or principal lattice . these interpretations also imply that betti numbers can be read from the number of _ acyclic partial orientations _ of @xmath1 ( see remark  [ sec : nopartorient ] , example  [ exam:1 ] , and theorem  [ thm : betti_coincide ] ) . as a corollary",
    ", it follows that the betti table of all these ideals are independent of the base field @xmath10 .    for complete graphs ,",
    "a minimal polyhedral cellular free resolutions for @xmath14 and @xmath15 was given in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the case of general graphs was left open in both works .",
    "our work generalizes these constructions to arbitrary graphs , puts their constructions into a larger context , and resolves several questions and conjectures from these papers .",
    "we should mention that minimal free resolutions and the betti numbers for both @xmath14 and @xmath15 were first established in @xcite and independently in @xcite .",
    "the first betti number for @xmath46 was computed in @xcite .",
    "a minimal _ cellular _",
    "resolution for @xmath14 was given in @xcite .",
    "very recently , the betti numbers for @xmath14 was also computed in @xcite .",
    "we also remark that it is possible to directly give a minimal polyhedral cellular free resolution for the ideal @xmath14 by our potential theoretic techniques in  [ sec : igresol ] , but we have chosen to skip the details of this construction here as all the main ideas appear elsewhere in this writing .",
    "moreover , an essentially equivalent ( see remark  [ rmk : cells](ii ) ) solution for @xmath14 has recently ( and independently ) appeared in @xcite , where they leave the solution for @xmath15 as an open problem .",
    "our techniques allow us to revisit some of the foundational results on _ chip - firing _ games and related fields .",
    "for example , we remark that our potential theoretic interpretation of grbner weights relating @xmath15 to @xmath14 gives a new proof of the result in @xcite interpreting @xmath47-reduced divisors as divisors of _ minimum total potential _ ( see remark  [ rmk : reducedpotential ] ) .",
    "a related problem is to describe the whole grbner cone of the initial ideal @xmath14 .",
    "this was a question of bernd sturmfels which we completely answer in  [ sec : grocone ] .",
    "we show that the rays of the grbner cone associated to @xmath14 correspond , in a precise sense , to green s functions .",
    "the equality of the betti tables of all of our ideals allows one to prove many numerical facts about one ideal by looking instead at another ideal in this family .",
    "we consider a few of such examples in  [ sec : conseq ] .",
    "one example is the computation of multiplicities .",
    "many applications are expected , and will appear in future work .",
    "throughout , we assume @xmath48 contains zero . all rings are commutative with @xmath49 .",
    "a _ graph _ means a finite , connected , unweighted multigraph with no loops . as usual , the set of vertices and edges of a graph @xmath1 are denoted by @xmath3 and @xmath50 . for @xmath51 ,",
