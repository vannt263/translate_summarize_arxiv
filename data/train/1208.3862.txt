    "consider observing a random sample @xmath2 of size @xmath3 , or at noise level @xmath4 , drawn from distribution @xmath5 , and indexed by some unknown parameter @xmath6 .",
    "the bayesian paradigm views the sample as having law @xmath5 conditionally on @xmath7 , that is , @xmath8 , and the law of @xmath7 is a _ prior probability distribution _",
    "@xmath9 on some @xmath10-field @xmath11 of @xmath12 .",
    "the random variable @xmath13 then has a law on @xmath12 which is known as the _ posterior distribution _ , denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "bayesian inference on @xmath7 is then entirely based on this posterior distribution ",
    "it gives access to point estimates for @xmath7 , credible sets and tests in a natural way .",
    "it is of interest to analyse the behaviour of @xmath14 under the frequentist sampling assumption that @xmath2 is drawn from @xmath15 for some fixed nonrandom @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath17 is a _ finite - dimensional _ space , then posterior - based inference has a fundamental justification through the bernstein ",
    "von mises ( bvm ) theorem , first discovered by laplace @xcite , developed by von mises @xcite , and put into the framework of modern parametric statistics by le cam @xcite .",
    "it states that , under mild and universal assumptions on the prior , the posterior distribution approximately equals a normal distribution @xmath18 centered at an efficient estimator @xmath19 for @xmath7 and with a covariance @xmath20 that attains the cramr ",
    "rao bound in the statistical model considered : as @xmath21 @xmath22 as a consequence posterior - based inference asymptotically coincides with inference based on standard efficient , @xmath23-consistent frequentist estimators @xmath19 of @xmath7 , giving a rigorous asymptotic justification of bayesian methods .",
    "the last decade has seen remarkable activity in the development of _ nonparametric _ bayes procedures , where @xmath12 is taken to be an infinite - dimensional space , typically consisting of functions or infinite vectors : nonparametric regression , classification , density estimation , normal means , and gaussian white noise models come to mind , and a variety of nonparametric priors have been devised in the literature for such models .",
    "posteriors can be computed efficiently by algorithms such as mcmc , and they provide broadly applicable bayesian inferential tools for nonparametric problems .",
    "it is natural to ask whether an analogue of ( [ bvm0 ] ) can still be proved in such situations , as it would give a general justification for the use of nonparametric bayes procedures .",
    "although remarkable progress has been made in the understanding of the frequentist properties of nonparametric bayes procedures ( we refer here only to some of the key papers such as @xcite and references therein ) , a fully satisfactory answer to the bvm - question seems not to have been found .",
    "a first reason is perhaps that it is not immediately clear what @xmath24 should be replaced by in the infinite - dimensional situation  gaussian distributions over infinite - dimensional spaces @xmath12 are much more complex objects , and their existence in the form relevant here depends on the topology that @xmath12 is endowed with .",
    "another reason is that the commonly used loss functions in nonparametric statistics ( such as @xmath25-type loss ) do not admit @xmath23-consistent estimators  the lan - type local approximations of the likelihood function used in the proof of the finite - dimensional bvm theorem are thus not accurate enough in such metrics .",
    "one way around these problems is to weaken the loss function on @xmath12 so that @xmath23-consistent estimation with gaussian limits is possible even in nonparametric models .",
    "for example , in the situation where one observes @xmath26 on @xmath27 $ ] , and @xmath28 is the empirical measure estimating @xmath29 , then for any @xmath29-donsker class @xmath30 of functions",
    "@xmath31 \\to\\mathbb r$ ] , @xmath32 in fact @xmath33 is an efficient estimator for @xmath29 in the space @xmath34 of bounded functions on @xmath30 , attaining the cramr ",
    "rao information bound for the fully nonparametric model ; cf .",
    "3.1.11 in @xcite .",
    "hence one may try to prove a bvm - type result by endowing the parameter space @xmath12 with the loss function coming from an @xmath35-type space .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate this approach rigorously in the setting of the gaussian white noise model , and with @xmath30 a ball in a suitable sobolev space defined below .",
    "this makes the mathematical analysis tractable without any severe loss of conceptual generality ; see below for a discussion of extensions to other models .",
    "our main results will imply that for a large and relevant class of nonparametric product priors @xmath9 that satisfy mild assumptions , and which do not require conjugacy , one has @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a gaussian measure on @xmath35 centered at an efficient estimator @xmath19 of  @xmath7 , both to be defined in a precise manner , and where the classes @xmath38 consist of measurable subsets of @xmath35 that have uniformly smooth boundaries for the measure @xmath37 .",
    "we note that some restrictions on the class @xmath38 are necessary as one can show that in the infinite - dimensional situation the bernstein ",
    "von mises theorem can not hold uniformly in all borel sets of @xmath39 ; see after definition [ bvmp ] for discussion .",
    "our assumptions apply to priors that produce posteriors which achieve frequentist optimal contraction rates in stronger loss functions ( such as @xmath1-distance ) and which resemble the state of the art prior choices in the nonparametric bayes literature .",
    "our abstract results only gain relevance through the fact that we can demonstrate their applicability : the general result ( [ bvm1 ] ) will be shown to imply that posterior - based credible regions give asymptotically exact frequentist confidence sets in a variety of concrete problems of nonparametric inference .",
    "a first important application is to weighted @xmath1-ellipsoid credible regions for the unknown parameter @xmath7 , which are shown to have optimal width @xmath40 in @xmath41-loss and which simultaneously are confidence sets that shrink in @xmath1-diameter at the minimax rate ( within log - factors ) over hlder balls .",
    "we further give semiparametric applications to estimation of linear and nonlinear functionals defined on @xmath12 , and to credible bands for estimating an auto - convolution @xmath42 .    a key point in these applications",
    "is related to the notion of the `` plug - in property '' coined by bickel and ritov @xcite .",
    "a nonparametric estimator that is rate - optimal in a standard loss function ( such as @xmath25-loss ) is said to have the plug - in property if it simultaneously efficiently estimates , at @xmath23-rate , a large class of linear functionals .",
    "standard frequentist estimators such as kernel , wavelet and nonparametric maximum likelihood estimators satisfy this property ; in fact , one can even prove a corresponding uniform central limit theorem in @xmath35 for such estimators ; see kiefer and wolfowitz @xcite , nickl @xcite , gin and nickl @xcite .",
    "our results imply that this is also true in the bayesian situation : the posterior contracts at the optimal rate in @xmath1-loss and at the same time satisfies a bernstein ",
    "von mises theorem in @xmath35 .",
    "our techniques of proof rely on the structure of the gaussian white noise model and apply as well , with simple modifications , to fixed design nonparametric regression settings .",
    "our proofs moreover indicate a strategy to obtain bvm results of this kind in general nonparametric sampling models : the idea is to obtain `` semiparametric '' bvm - results for many fixed linear functionals simultaneously , and to re - construct `` nonparametric '' norms from these functionals . at least for density estimation such ideas",
    "can be shown to work as well , and this is subject of forthcoming research .",
    "there is important work on the bvm phenomenon for nonparametric procedures that needs mentioning .",
    "cox @xcite and freedman @xcite have shown the impossibility of a nonparametric bvm result in a strict @xmath1-setting .",
    "leahu @xcite derives interesting results on the possibility and impossibility of bvm - theorems for undersmoothing priors  his negative results will be relevant below .",
    "his positive findings are , however , strongly tied to the gaussian conjugate situation , do not address efficiency questions , and do not give rise to posteriors with the above mentioned `` plug - in property . '' for the related question of obtaining semiparametric bvm - results , general sufficient conditions are given in castillo @xcite and bickel and kleijn @xcite , as well as in rivoirard and rousseau @xcite for linear functionals of probability density functions .",
    "a number of bvm - type results have been obtained for the fixed finite - dimensional posterior with dimension increasing to infinity : ghosal @xcite and bontemps @xcite consider regression with a finite number of regressors , ghosal @xcite and clarke and ghosal @xcite consider exponential families , and the case of discrete probability distributions is treated in boucheron and gassiat @xcite .",
    "this article is organised as follows : in the next two subsections we define a general notion of the nonparametric bvm phenomenon . in section [ confc ] we demonstrate that when this phenomenon holds , posterior - based inference is valid from a frequentist point of view in a variety of concrete examples from nonparametric statistics . in section [ mainbvm ] we prove that for a large class of natural priors on @xmath1 , the bvm phenomenon indeed occurs .",

    "von mises - type result rests typically on the fact that efficient estimation at the rate @xmath23 is possible . in the nonparametric situation",
    "this rules out @xmath25-type loss functions , but leads one to consider weaker @xmath47-type norms discussed in ( [ pipu ] ) .",
    "for the particular choice of @xmath48 equal to an order-@xmath49 sobolev - ball , we can understand this better by using simple but useful hilbert space duality arguments in the nested scale of sobolev spaces @xmath50 on @xmath27 $ ] : we define these in precise detail below , but note for the moment that @xmath51 , so to weaken the norm beyond @xmath1 means that we should decrease @xmath52 to be negative . for @xmath53",
    "the space @xmath54 can be realised in an isometric way as a closed subspace of @xmath55 , explaining heuristically the connection to the discussion surrounding ( [ pipu ] ) above .",
    "the space should be large enough so that the gaussian experiment in ( [ wni ] ) can be realised as a tight random element in @xmath54 . the critical value for this to be the case is @xmath56 , and we define in ( [ spaces ] ) below a ( in a certain sense `` maximal '' ) sobolev space @xmath57 with norm @xmath58 in which the random trajectory @xmath59 defines a tight gaussian borel random variable @xmath60 with mean @xmath7 and covariance @xmath61 .",
    "that is , if we denote by @xmath62 the centered gaussian borel random variable on @xmath57 with covariance @xmath63 , then ( [ wni ] ) can be written as @xmath64 a natural gaussian shift experiment in the hilbert space @xmath57 .",
    "one can show moreover that @xmath60 is an efficient estimator for @xmath7 for the loss function of @xmath57 .",
    "any ( borel or cylindrical ) probability measure on @xmath1 gives rise to a tight probability measure on @xmath57 simply by the continuous ( hilbert  schmidt ) injection @xmath65 .",
    "let thus @xmath9 be a prior on @xmath1 , and let @xmath66 be the posterior distribution on @xmath57 given the observed trajectory from ( [ wni ] ) , or equivalently , from ( [ shift ] ) .",
    "on @xmath57 and for @xmath67 , define the transformation @xmath68 let @xmath69 be the image of the posterior law under @xmath70 .",
    "the shape of @xmath71 reveals how the posterior concentrates on @xmath23-@xmath57-neighborhoods of the efficient estimator @xmath60 .",
    "to compare probability distributions on @xmath57 we may use any metric for weak convergence of probability measures , and we choose the bounded lipschitz metric here for convenience ( it is defined in section [ weak ] ) .",
    "let @xmath72 be the standard gaussian probability measure on @xmath57 with mean zero and covariance @xmath63 constructed in section [ sob ] below .",
    "it should be distinguished from the standard gaussian law @xmath73 on @xmath74 .",
    "[ bvmp ] consider data generated from equation ( [ wni ] ) under a fixed function @xmath75 , and denote by @xmath15 the distribution of @xmath76 .",
    "let @xmath77 be the bounded lipschitz metric for weak convergence of probability measures on @xmath57 .",
    "we say that a prior @xmath9 satisfies the weak bernstein ",
    "von mises phenomenon in @xmath57 if , as @xmath21 , @xmath78    we note that the fact that the result is phrased in a way in which @xmath37 is independent of @xmath3 is important since @xmath77 does not induce a uniformity structure for the topology of weak convergence ; see the remark on page 413 in @xcite .",
    "thus when the weak bernstein ",
    "von mises phenomenon holds , the posterior necessarily has the approximate shape of an infinite - dimensional gaussian distribution .",
    "moreover , we require this gaussian distribution to equal @xmath79 , the canonical choice in view of efficiency considerations . the covariance of @xmath79 is the cramr ",
    "rao bound for estimating @xmath7 in the gaussian shift experiment ( [ shift ] ) in @xmath57-loss , and we shall see how this carries over to sufficiently regular real - valued functionals @xmath80 ; see section [ sec - funct ] below",
    ".    one may ask by analogy to the finite - dimensional situation whether a _ strong _ bernstein ",
    "von mises phenomenon , where @xmath77 is replaced by the total variation norm , can be proved .",
    "it follows from theorem 2 in @xcite that already in the gaussian conjugate situation , such a result is impossible unless one restricts to very specific priors ( which in particular do not possess the plug - in property that will be needed in the key applications below ) .    now with weak instead of total variation convergence",
    ", we can not infer that @xmath69 and @xmath37 are approximately the same for every borel set in @xmath57 , but only for sets @xmath81 that are continuity sets for the probability measure @xmath37 .",
    "for statistical applications of the bernstein ",
    "von mises phenomenon , one typically needs some uniformity in @xmath81 , and this is where total variation results would be particularly useful .",
    "weak convergence in @xmath57 implies that @xmath69 is close to @xmath37 uniformly in certain classes of subsets of @xmath57 whose boundaries are sufficiently regular relative to the measure  @xmath37 ( see section [ weak ] ) , and we show below how this allows for enough uniformity to deal with a variety of concrete nonparametric statistical problems .",

    "this implies that the posterior mean @xmath83 of @xmath84 satisfies @xmath85 so in semiparametric terminology the posterior mean is asymptotically linear in @xmath57 with respect to @xmath60 ; in particular , @xmath86 is an efficient estimator for @xmath7 .",
