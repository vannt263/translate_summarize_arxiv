    "observations of high - z quasars indicate that the intergalactic medium ( igm ) was ionized at z @xmath1 6 .",
    "in addition , the recent _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( wmap ) observations suggest that the universe was reionized as early as z @xmath2 17 ( kogut et al . 2003 ) .",
    "it is still unclear what astrophysical phenomena caused the reionization of the universe , but photoionization by massive stars is among the most promising candidates .",
    "it is hence important to study the star formation in the early universe . the first generation of stars was formed out of unmagnetized gas of primordial composition , which leads to simplification of the relevant physics . on the other hand ,",
    "the formation processes of second - generation stars are more complex because of various feedback effects from the first stars , for example , radiative heating and ionization / dissociation , metal enrichment , secondary density and velocity fluctuations etc .",
    "( e.g. , ciardi & ferrara 2004 ) . for reliably predicting the star formation history and the initial mass function ( imf ) , etc . , it is crucial to understand various feedback effects in the high - redshift universe .    in the context of cold dark matter ( cdm )",
    "cosmology , the first collapsed objects are predicted to have masses corresponding to virial temperature @xmath3 ( hereafter , we refer to such objects as `` small halos '' ) . in such halos , gas cools and contracts further to form stars only via h@xmath0 rovibrational emission .",
    "the first stars , which formed in small halos , are indicated to have masses of a few hundreds m@xmath4 ( abel , bryan & norman 2002 ; bromm , coppi & larson 2002 ; omukai & palla 2003 ) .",
    "once such a massive first star forms in a small halo , an enormous amount of ionizing photons from the star ionizes its surrounding gas ( whalen , abel & norman 2004 ; kitayama et al .",
    "2004 ) and photodissociates the molecular hydrogen .",
    "consequently , star formation in the same halo is completely suppressed ( omukai & nishi 1999 ; glover & brand 2001 ) .",
    "after that , depending on the mass , the central star will explode as a sn or collapse directly into a bh at the end of its lifetime .",
    "zero - metal stars in the ranges 10  40 m@xmath4 and 140  260 m@xmath4 explode as type ii sne or pair - instability sne , respectively ( heger & woosley 2002 ; umeda & nomoto 2002 ) .",
    "the ashes of these first sne pollute their surrounding gas with metals and dust grains , out of which subsequent generations of low - mass stars form ( bromm et al .",
    "2001 ; schneider et al . 2002 ; omukai et al .",
    "2005 ) . however , more often than not , the first stars directly form bhs without sne since the stellar mass range that causes sne is rather limited . after the death of the exciting star , ionized gas in the hii region begins to recombine .",
    "we call such an ex - hii region after the death of the exciting star a fossil hii region ( after oh & haiman 2003 )",
    ". in shock ionized gas in large halos at virialization and sn shells , formation of h@xmath0 and hd molecules are promoted ( mac low & shull 1986 ; shapiro & kang 1987 ; yamada & nishi 1998 ) .",
    "a similar situation can happen also in a fossil hii region .",
    "high ionization degree there facilitates formation of h@xmath0 via the h@xmath5 channel .",
    "the gas can cool and contract owing to the h@xmath0 cooling , thereby producing a subsequent generation of stars in the same halo .",
    "in particular , in those halos , more h@xmath0 is formed and then lower temperature is achieved than in the first star formation because of the initial ionization . the enhanced h@xmath0 cooling and resultant lower temperature environment facilitates hd formation . although the mass of primordial stars is often supposed to be very high , hd cooling , if it becomes important , enables the formation of low - mass stars ( uehara & inutsuka 2000 ; nakamura & umemura 2002 ) .",
    "the problems we try to solve in this paper are the following : does the ionized primordial gas in a small halo cool and subsequently form stars again inside the same halo ? does hd work as an efficient coolant in such situations ? to tackle these problems , we treat the gas as one - dimensional spherically symmetric fluid and follow the evolution with solving chemical reactions in primordial gas .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the numerical model used in this paper .",
    "section 3 presents the results of our simulation , and section 4 is devoted to the discussion .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions . throughout this paper , we adopt a flat @xmath6cdm cosmology with density parameters @xmath7 = 0.73 , @xmath8 = 0.27 , @xmath9 = 0.044 and the hubble parameter @xmath10 ( spergel et al . 2003 ) .",
    "as an evolution of fossil hii regions , which were once stellar ionized regions but now are recombining because of the death of the exciting stars , within small halos in the early universe , we envisage the following scenario .",
    "first , the first star forms at the center of a small halo . then , an enormous amount of ionizing flux from the first star forms an hii region . during the lifetime of the exciting star ,",
    "the radius of gas accelerated by high pressure of the ionized gas reaches @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , @xmath13 are the sound speed of the gas and the lifetime of a massive star , respectively , while the hii region itself extends to an even larger radius . note that despite the shallow potential well of a small halo , photoevaporation does not always occur : since the hii region is smaller than the radius of the halos , gas can avoid photoevaporation if cooling takes place immediately .",
    "if the star explodes as a sn at the end of its lifetime , the gas inside these halos will be swept out by its blast wave ( bromm , yoshida & hernquist 2003 ; wada & venkatesan 2003 ) .",
    "however , here we consider the case where the central star directly forms a bh without a sn explosion .",
    "specifically , we calculate the evolution of the ionized gas starting from the state after the death of the central star ( whalen et al.2004 ; kitayama et al.2004 ) .",
    "we employ one - dimensional hydrodynamics with spherical symmetry along with primordial gas chemistry . in this simulation ,",
    "we ignore any influence of a relic bh , which resides in the central region of the halo , on its surrounding gas , for simplicity . in reality ,",
    "accretion onto the bh generates some photodissociative radiation . according to oshea et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , however , this does not affect the h@xmath0 formation in the halo significantly .",
    "the gravitational effect of the bh is assessed from its bondi accretion radius in this paper . at the outer boundary , since our interest is the central region of the gas , we take the gas radius to be 200 pc , which is the radius of the expanding region according to whalen et al . ( 2004 ) s results , and set the pressure outside the cloud to be zero .",
    "this setting means that only the accelerated region inside the hii region is considered : the matter outside is neglected whether it is ionized or not .",
    "we have also performed runs with a gas radius of 1 kpc that corresponds to the whole hii region and have confirmed that our results remain almost unaltered for the halo mass @xmath14 10@xmath15 m@xmath4 .",
    "we assume spherical symmetry , and neglect both magnetic field and external radiation field except for cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation .",
    "the basic equations of one - dimensional spherically symmetric fluid are the following : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath7 , @xmath27 , @xmath6 are the radius , mass , density , pressure , temperature , internal energy per unit mass , mean molecular weight in units of the proton mass @xmath28 , the total mass interior to @xmath17 , the gravitational constant , the boltzmann constant , the cosmological constant , the hubble parameter at the present - day , and the cooling rate per unit volume , respectively .",
    "the last term of the right - hand side in the second equation represents the correction of the expanding universe . the adiabatic index @xmath29 , which depends on chemical abundances , is calculated at each time - step .",
    "we here neglect the chemical heating / cooling term because it is not important in the density range we considered ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "we solve these equations using the standard second - order - accurate lagrangian finite - difference scheme with von neumann - richtmyer artificial viscosity ( e.g. , mihalas & mihalas 1984 ; thoul & weinberg 1995 ; omukai & nishi 1998 ) . the grids are spaced unequally in mass .",
    "the innermost cell contains 3.7 @xmath31 10@xmath32 m@xmath4 , and the increments in radius between adjacent grid cells are increased by 5 % outwardly .",
    "we take 100 cells and have confirmed that it is enough to follow the evolution near the center .",
    "we need to determine the dark - matter distribution to solve a set of hydrodynamic equations .",
    "we assume that the dark - matter distribution is fixed in time since dark matter has already virialized at the phase that we are interested in .",
    "we adopt the dark - matter density profile derived by navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ) : @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 are the critical density at virialization redshift , characteristic dimensionless density at the center and characteristic radius , respectively .",
    "this density profile has the following three parameters : the mass of a dark matter halo m@xmath37 , the virialization redshift @xmath38 of the halo , and the concentration parameter @xmath39 , which expresses the concentration of mass near the center of the halo .",
    "in particular , by using @xmath39 , the virial radius of the halo @xmath40 . here",
    "we fix @xmath39 = 5 because its small variation does not affect our results .",
    "we incorporate rovibrational line cooling of h@xmath0 and hd , ly@xmath41 line cooling of atomic hydrogen , and compton cooling by cmb radiation since we consider the temperature range @xmath42 2 @xmath31 10@xmath43 k. for line cooling of h@xmath0 we adopt the fitting function given by galli & palla ( 1998 ) .",
    "hd cooling rate is calculated by solving the statistical equilibrium between the first 5 rotational levels . the radiative and collisional transition rate coefficients are the same as those in galli and palla ( 1998 ) .",
    "ly@xmath41 line cooling rate of atomic hydrogen is given by ( dalgarno & mccray 1972 ) @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the number density of neutral hydrogen .",
    "the compton cooling rate is given by ( e.g.,rybicki & lightman 1979 ) @xmath46 where @xmath39 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 are the speed of light , thomson scattering cross section , number density of electron , energy density of photon and photon temperature , respectively .",
    "when the gas temperature decreases as low as the cmb temperature @xmath50 , the heating by the radiation becomes important .",
    "we include this effect by replacing the radiative cooling rate @xmath6 with @xmath51 .",
    "we need to solve chemical reactions as well as hydrodynamic equations since cooling of the gas depends on chemical abundances of the coolants .",
    "we assume that the reactions are only two - body collisional ones and do not include the three - body h@xmath0 formation process because we consider only the low density range ( @xmath52 @xmath42 10@xmath53 @xmath54 ) .",
    "the evolution of chemical species @xmath55 is followed by solving the kinetic equation @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the reaction rate coefficients of destruction and those of formation , respectively .    since no pollution of the gas with metals has taken place in this situation , we consider the following 14 species : h , h@xmath59 , h@xmath60 , h@xmath0 , h@xmath61 , he , he@xmath59 , he@xmath62 , e@xmath60 , d , d@xmath59 , d@xmath60 , hd , hd@xmath59 . the fractions of he and d atoms are assumed to be 0.0833 and 2.5 @xmath31 10@xmath63 , respectively , which are inferred from big bang nucleosynthesis ( romano et al .",
    "reactions among h and he compounds and their rate coefficients are the same as those in abel et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . for d reactions ,",
    "we adopt the compilation by nakamura & umemura ( 2002 ) , although we replace the rate coefficients of the reactions d5 , d9 , d10 and d11 with those by galli & palla ( 2002 ) .",
    "the total number of considered reactions amounts to 37 .",
    "we solve the rate equations for 14 species above using an implicit difference scheme .",
    "we assume that the first star in a small halo is formed around the time of virialization .",
    "the initial epoch of our calculation is after 3 myr , the typical lifetime of massive stars , of virialization .",
    "the evolution of the first hii regions in the early universe has been studied by whalen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and kitayama et al .",
    "we construct the initial density and velocity distributions following whalen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) s results .",
    "their results show that , inside the hii region , there are two distinct regions : the inner region is expanding with outwardly increasing velocity and the velocity reaches the sound speed of the ionized gas at a radius of @xmath2 200 pc , while the gas outside is almost unaccelerated .",
    "we consider only the expanding region in our calculation . also , according to whalen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , the density distribution inside that region is almost constant ( @xmath2 0.06 @xmath54 ) , and the velocity increases gradually from the center outward .",
    "as the fiducial runs , we assume that the density profile of gas is constant at 0.06 @xmath54 , and that the velocity is proportional to the radius . at 200 pc from the center ,",
    "the velocity is about sound speed .",
    "there is no gas outside this region .",
    "we set the initial gas temperature inside the hii region to be 2 @xmath31 10@xmath43 k. the gas is assumed to be fully ionized initially .",
    "this initial condition corresponds to the total baryonic mass of @xmath64 in the fiducial cases . in the case of 10@xmath65 m@xmath4 halos",
    ", this condition leads to too much baryon compared to dark matter .",
    "probably a lower gas - density state is more appropriate as an initial condition for such a small halo .",
    "our choice of the initial condition facilitates the cloud to cool and contract .",
    "even with this favorable condition , however , they do not cool anyway as described later .",
    "then , the results do not change even if the initial gas density is lowered . for simplicity ,",
    "we use the same initial condition for baryons in all the cases .",
    "the size of the flat density region ( @xmath2 200 pc ) is basically the sound speed in the hii region @xmath66 times the lifetime of the exciting stars @xmath67 .",
    "although the size of the flat density region does not depend significantly on halo quantities , there should still be some density variations among halos .",
    "to study the effect of different initial gas densities , we also calculate the cases where the initial gas density is either halved or doubled from the fiducial value .",
    "we follow the evolution until the local hubble time at @xmath38 passes or the central number density reaches the threshold value 10@xmath53 @xmath54 . when the latter condition is satisfied , we regard the gas to have cooled and collapsed .",
    "we take the threshold density at 10@xmath53 @xmath54 , since three - body h@xmath0 formation , which we do not include here , becomes important for higher densities and the evolution can not be followed correctly thereafter .",
    "the results do not depend on the value of the threshold density as long as the free - fall time there is sufficiently shorter than the local hubble time .",

    "we have shown that the temperature in a fossil hii region of the first star drops as low as the cmb temperature by hd cooling even with the primordial composition . in the case of the formation of first - generation stars ,",
    "hd does not become important and such a low temperature is not attained ( bromm et al .",
    "in our situation , the high electron fraction enables molecular hydrogen to form in a larger amount than in an initially un - ionized cloud .",
    "abundant h@xmath0 molecules thus formed cool the gas below the threshold temperature for hd formation ( @xmath70k ; omukai et al .",
    "under such a low temperature environment , with further contraction the gas is expected to fragment into low - mass ( @xmath2 0.1  2 m@xmath4 ) gas clumps ( uehara & inutsuka 2000 ; nakamura & umemura 2002 ) .",
    "uehara & inutsuka ( 2000 ) claimed that subsolar mass stars are formed by hd cooling in a cooled layer behind an ionizing shock due to either virialization or a sn . in the case of a virialization shock ,",
    "the halo must be massive enough to cause a strong shock .",
    "when such large halos are formed in the standard bottom - up scenario of structure formation , star formation and metal - enrichment may have proceeded in building blocks .",
    "similarly , in the case of sn shocked layers , metal - pollution might have taken place at the explosion .",
    "therefore , it is not certain whether the gas in such shock - ionized region remains metal - free . on the other hand , here we have proposed a viable scenario for forming low - mass stars from primordial pristine gas . if those low - mass stars accrete metal - polluted interstellar medium after the formation , they might resemble ultra metal - deficient stars ( e.g. , yoshii 1981 ) .",
    "this may explain the origin of the ultra metal - deficient low - mass stars discovered recently ( christlieb et al .",
    "2002 ; frebel et al . 2005 ) .    here , we estimate the number of second - generation stars forming in a fossil hii region . the mass of the central cooled clump m@xmath71 is about 45 m@xmath4 in the fiducial run ( section 3 ) .",
    "by using the star formation efficiency @xmath72 and the typical mass - scale of the second - generation stars m@xmath73 , the number of the second - generation stars is @xmath74 a few second - generation stars are formed per each first star if they are in relatively massive ( @xmath75 ) halos .",
    "next , we evaluate the accretion rate onto the protostars . as mentioned in section [ sec : results ] , the core radius becomes @xmath76 in the presence of dark matter .",
    "assuming the gas mass in the core @xmath77 falls into the center in the free - fall time @xmath78 , the accretion rate becomes @xmath79 namely , when dark matter dominates the gravity , the accretion rate becomes smaller than that without dark matter by a factor of @xmath80 . in figure",
    "[ fig : mdot ] , we show the mass accretion rate by equation ( [ eq : mdot ] ) for the fiducial run . as a time coordinate , we use the mass of the central star , i.e. , the gas mass that has already accreted at a given time . also shown for comparison",
    "is @xmath81 , which is the accretion rate without dark matter ( shu 1977 ) .",
    "initially , the effects of dark matter is weak in the accretion rate because the self - gravity dominates in the inner part .",
    "the accretion rate is about @xmath82 .",
    "this is smaller than that in the first star formation , @xmath83 because of the lower temperature resulting from hd cooling .",
    "later the discrepancy from @xmath81 becomes significant because of dominant dark - matter gravity : the accretion rate by equation ( [ eq : mdot ] ) remains @xmath84 , while @xmath81 becomes large owing to the higher temperature in the outer part .",

    ", width=377 ]    recently , oshea et al .",
    "( 2005 ) studied the evolution of a fossil hii region from a similar initial condition to ours .",
    "their conclusion agrees with ours in the respect that the enhanced electron fraction promotes h@xmath0 formation and the resultant lower temperature enables formation of lower mass stars than the first - generation stars . since they utilized detailed three - dimensional hydrodynamics ,",
    "their calculation is superior to ours with respect to the dynamics .",
    "however , they did not include deuterium chemistry , which is found to be important in our calculation . in this regard ,",
    "our calculation is complementary to theirs .",
    "they discussed the mass scale of the second - generation stars by comparing the accretion timescale @xmath85 with the kelvin - helmholtz timescale @xmath86 : since it takes a kelvin - helmholtz timescale for a protostellar cloud to contract enough to ignite nuclear fusion , the mass where these two timescales become equal corresponds to the mass of an accreting protostar when it reaches the main sequence . note that in deriving the mass - scale of the stars by equating these two timescales , oshea et al .",
    "( 2005 ) implicitly assumed that the accretion is halted by an unknown mechanism at the onset of the hydrogen burning .",
    "for comparison with oshea et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , if we adopt the same timescale argument , the stellar mass becomes @xmath2 16 m@xmath4 in our case , with the timescales @xmath2 2.2 @xmath31 10@xmath65 yr . in this evaluation",
    ", we used the stellar parameters listed in schaerer ( 2002 ) .",
    "this stellar mass - scale is similar to that by oshea et al .",
    "( 2005 ) owing to the similar accretion rate to theirs ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "this lower accretion rate compared with that of the first stars ( @xmath88 ) is due to lower temperature by the hd cooling in our case , while in oshea et al .",
    "( 2005 ) it is due to high angular momentum of the star forming clumps .",
    "if we included both of these effects , the accretion rate and then the stellar mass - scale would be even lower .",
    "johnson & bromm ( 2005 ) and shchekinov & vasiliev ( 2005 ) stressed the importance of hd chemistry in the early universe , studying evolution of gas ionized by strong shocks .",
    "this situation is similar to that supposed by uehara & inutsuka ( 2000 ) .",
    "although the cause of ionization is different from ours , the final consequence is similar : the hd formation is facilitated by ionization and the temperature declines as low as the cmb temperature .",
    "johnson & bromm ( 2005 ) also mentioned the evolution of fossil hii regions and pointed out the importance of hd .",
    "they suggested that the second - generation stars have lower mass than the first - stars owing to the lower temperature environment .",
    "we here confirmed their claim by more detailed calculations .    in this paper , we do not include external radiative heating , except for the cmb radiation in our calculation . by comparing runs with and without cmb radiation , we find that the sole effect of the cmb radiation is preventing the gas from falling below the radiation temperature : it does not alter the higher temperature behavior at all . if the first stars have already created the uv background radiation , we need to take account of such effects as photoionization / dissociation and photo - heating .",
    "oh & haiman ( 2003 ) discussed that in the presence of a uv radiation field , subsequent star formation is prevented in fossil hii regions .",
    "as a future work , we are planning to include effects of the uv field in our calculation and examine the validity of their claim .",
    "finally , we need to consider the effect of a remnant bh . the radiation from the gas accreted onto a bh can affect the surrounding gas",
    ". however , oshea et al .",
    "( 2005 ) indicated that photodissociation flux expected from this is insufficient to alter the h@xmath0 fraction significantly .",
    "the bh also has an effect on the gas dynamics through the gravitational field .",
    "the length scale of the region influenced by the bh gravity is given by the bondi accretion radius @xmath89 where m@xmath90 and @xmath23 are the bh mass and the mean molecular weight of the gas , respectively .",
    "the mass inside the bondi radius is initially negligible compared to the total mass of the collapsing gas . with cooling and contraction , however , the bondi radius becomes as large as the central core radius .",
    "therefore if the bh exists exactly at the center of the halo , all the cooled gas is eventually accreted into the bh , instead of forming the next generation of stars .",
    "however , even in the case of direct bh formation , part of the mass is likely to be shed non - spherically .",
    "if so , the bh would be kicked out of the shallow potential wells of small halos , or even if it could remain inside the halo , it would be off - center . in these cases ,",
    "the second - generation star formation occurs as shown in our calculation .",
    "we have investigated the evolution of photo - ionized gas in small halos since the death of the exciting first star , by using one - dimensional hydrodynamics incorporating primordial gas chemistry .",
    "we have found that the high electron fraction induces molecular hydrogen formation in a larger amount than in a cloud without initial ionization .",
    "the enhanced h@xmath0 cooling makes temperature in the central region lower than the threshold value for hd formation .",
    "the cooling by hd further drops the temperature below 100 k. we have also shown that the gas in halos with @xmath14 10@xmath15 m@xmath4 cools sufficiently and subsequently forms stars . in those hd - cooling halos , the gas collapses further at @xmath42 100 k and eventually fragments into low - mass cores . inside these cores ,",
    "low - mass stars are expected to form .",
    "the nature of second - generation stars can be quite different from that of first stars despite being composed of the same material .",
