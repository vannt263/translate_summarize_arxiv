    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the milky way ( mw ) and other galaxies is a complex mix of gas and dust .",
    "the processes involved in maintaining the mass , energy , and ionization balance of the ism are not properly understood .",
    "high resolution ultraviolet ( _ uv _ ) spectra provides information about these processes as many absorption lines of atoms , ions and molecules are present in the _ uv _ band of the electromagnetic spectrum , one of the most important of which is o@xmath2 ( o  vi ) , a diagnostic of temperatures of about @xmath3  k @xcite .",
    "such temperatures are found at the interface of hot ( t @xmath4 k ) and warm ( t @xmath5 k ) ionized gas in the ism .",
    "thus , o  vi absorption lines at 1031.9   and 1037.6   are crucial diagnostics of the energetic processes of interface environments in the ism of galaxies",
    ". the gas at such temperatures is cooling radiatively and the cooling is essentially independent of density , metallicity and the heating mechanism @xcite .",
    "o  vi formation by photo - ionization is unable to explain the observed abundances , given the energy of photons needed to get such high ionization ( 114 ev ) .",
    "o  vi is mostly produced by shock heating and is collisionally ionized @xcite .",
    "previous studies of o  vi have been limited to observations by the _ copernicus _ satellite @xcite and the _ hopkins ultraviolet telescope _ @xcite .",
    "@xcite concluded that the hot gas exists in discrete regions rather than being continuously present in the ism .",
    "the launch of _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ ; @xcite enabled a wider and more descriptive study of o  vi absorption and emission in the ism and the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . with a spectral resolution of   20,000 , _",
    "fuse _ has been able to resolve fine details of o  vi in many different environments .",
    "_ fuse _ observed o  vi absorption lines in the local ism of the mw @xcite , disk of the mw @xcite , halo of the mw @xcite , the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ; @xcite ) , the small magellanic cloud ( smc ; @xcite ) , starburst galaxies @xcite , igm @xcite , etc . apart from absorption studies , _ fuse _ has also recorded o  vi spectra in emission from observations of diffuse ism in the mw @xcite and superbubbles in the lmc @xcite . these studies have not only augmented our knowledge about the formation and distribution of o  vi in the mw and the magellanic clouds but have also helped in better understanding of the complexities of the ism .",
    "owing to the contiguity to the mw ( @xmath6 50 kpc ; @xcite ) and being nearly a face - on galaxy with a low inclination angle ( @xmath6 35@xmath7 ; @xcite ) , the lmc has been the subject of numerous studies to understand and interpret the properties of ism .",
    "recent studies of the ism in the lmc include observations of diffuse uv emission @xcite , the _ spitzer _ infrared dust survey ( sage ; @xcite ) , the hi survey @xcite , the h@xmath1 survey @xcite , the o  vi distribution @xcite , and the survey of hot gas in the x - ray bands @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite analyzed the absorption of o  vi , c iv , si iv and n v ions towards four early type stars in the lmc and provide crucial details about the environments that may be probed through the study of these ions .",
    "@xcite surveyed the distribution and kinematics of o  vi towards 12 early type stars in the lmc , which was very selective and the targets were restricted to wolf - rayet stars and o - type stars of spectral types o7 and earlier . here",
    "we report an extensive survey of o  vi absorption at 1032   in the lmc . the observation log is given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the results presented in this survey become important as they not only provide a detailed mapping of the interface gas traced by o  vi but also throw light on the small scale structure of the o  vi distribution in various regions of the lmc .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the lines of sight and different regions of the lmc including the superbubbles ( marked by circles ) that have been studied in this survey .",
    "the _ fuse _ mission and its operations are described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "observations are made through one of 3 apertures : the hirs ( @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 ) ; the mdrs ( @xmath11 @xmath9 @xmath10 ) ; and the lwrs ( @xmath12 @xmath9 @xmath12 ) , with all three obtaining data simultaneously . depending on the coating of the spectrograph , observations are possible through sic and lif channels that are further divided into eight different segments ; the sic 1a , sic 2a , sic 1b and sic 2b segments covering the wavelength range 905 to 1105   and lif 1a , lif 2a , lif 1b and lif 2b segments covering the wavelength range 1000 to 1187  .",
    "the data from sic 2b segment have been known to suffer from a fixed noise .",
    "the sensitivity of lif 1a segment near 1032   is almost double that of other segments and therefore , we have used only the lif 1a observations @xcite .",
    "most of the data are from the large aperture lwrs with a few from the mdrs aperture .",
    "the fully calibrated _ fuse _ spectra were downloaded from the multimission archive at stsci ( mast ) processed by the latest _ fuse _ data reduction pipeline ( calfuse version 3.2 ; @xcite ) .",
    "_ fuse _ made more than 600 pointings in and around the lmc .",
    "several of the observations were rejected initially by just looking at the spectra ( with non - existent or low signal - to - noise of o  vi absorption ) .",
    "70 unique _ fuse _ targets were selected based mainly on the simplicity of the continuum fitting in the vicinity of o  vi ( at 1031.9  ) .",
    "o  vi absorption for 1 of the sightline has been reported by @xcite , 11 have been covered by @xcite survey , 3 by @xcite and 1 by @xcite .",
    "spectral types and other stellar information was taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have downgraded all the spectra reported here to 35 km  s@xmath13 to have a higher signal - to - noise .",
    "this has been done for all the spectra irrespective of the quality to maintain uniformity in the data analysis procedure .",
    "fitting the stellar continuum in the neighbourhood of the o  vi absorption profile has been discussed in detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite have limited their study to early type stars based on the fact that these stars have completely developed o  vi p cygni profiles that are easier to fit as the early type stars have a high mass loss rate and have minimal wind variations . @xcite",
    "have shown that for galactic sight lines , the stellar wind variability has negligible effect on o  vi absorption but may introduce substantial errors towards targets in the magellanic clouds .",
    "@xcite did find variation in the equivalent width and column density towards a lmc star when estimated at two different times .",
    "this warrants for extra care while fitting the continuum for magellanic cloud targets .    as discussed above , for the lmc , the estimation of stellar continuum in the vicinity of o  vi absorption is not trivial .",
    "our background targets are mostly early o and b type stars with several wolf - rayets .",
    "these have been selected based on the fact that the the continuum near the o  vi absorption at 1031.9   is simple to fit .",
    "a few of the lines of sight do show a complex behaviour near o  vi absorption ( for e.g. , sk-67d05 , sk-67d168 , sk-70d115 , etc . ) .",
    "for such exceptional lines of sight , the complexity in the continuum fitting is due to a local dip or a sudden rise near the o  vi absorption and these targets needed a comparatively higher order polynomial for the fitting . for a flavour of the complexity involved ,",
    "sample continuum fitting for three lines of sight , bi13 , sk-70d115 and sk-67d168 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . following the fitting procedure of @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the local stellar continuum was estimated for all the targets and were fitted by a legendre polynomial fit of low order ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "several continua were tested and the uncertainties involved for the complete data set were used in the measurement of the o  vi column densities .",
    "the normalized spectra in the vicinity of o  vi absorption are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "the o  vi absorption may be contaminated by absorption from molecular hydrogen , however , it is minimal in the lmc velocity range .",
    "this is because the molecular fraction of h@xmath15 in the lmc is only about 12% of the molecular fraction in the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "the closest absorption line of h@xmath15 to o  vi absorption in the lmc lies at 1032.35   ( at v@xmath16 + 123 km  s@xmath13 ) , which is due to ( 60 ) r(4 ) transition .",
    "an estimation of possible contamination by h@xmath15 towards 12 lines of sight in the lmc has been done by @xcite where they find that h@xmath15 absorption does not affect the lmc o  vi column densities significantly .",
    "the h@xmath15 absorption feature are usually not a problem for measurements of o  vi absorption at velocities more than 20 km  s@xmath13 apart ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we estimate the contamination from h@xmath15 lines by fitting the ( 60 ) p(3 ) h@xmath15 transition for the mw and ( 60 ) r(4 ) h@xmath15 transition for the lmc ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . from this , we are able to estimate the contamination due to ( 60 ) r(4 ) mw h@xmath15 line and",
    "( 60 ) p(3 ) lmc h@xmath15 line .",
    "noticeable contamination is seen for the sightlines sk-71d45 and sk-67d250 which is well within the error bar of the derived column densities .",
    "an example of a sightline is also shown in fig",
    ". [ fig4 ] in which the lmc o  vi absorption is free from any contamination from molecular hydrogen .",
    "owing to the negligible contribution , we have not excluded the contamination by h@xmath15 in the o  vi measurements for the lmc .",
    "another possible contaminant is the ( 60 ) r(0 ) transition of the hd molecule at 1031.91   that overlaps with the mw o  vi absorption .",
    "several lines of hd molecule is covered by _ fuse _ ( see @xcite for a complete list ) .",
    "column densities are significantly low in the lmc and contamination due to molecular hydrogen lines is non - significant for o  vi measurements in the lmc .",
    "absorption due to hd is about 4 orders weaker compared to h@xmath15 transitions .",
    "therefore , we neglect any contribution from hd molecule to the column densities of o  vi in the lmc .",
    "the measurement of equivalent widths and column densities of o  vi absorption for all the lines of sight were done following @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this apparent optical depth technique @xcite is now commonly used in the analysis of interstellar absorption lines and is applicable to cases with non - saturated absorption profiles .",
    "briefly the technique uses an apparent optical depth in terms of velocity , i.e. , an instrumentally blurred version of the true optical depth , given as    @xmath17,\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 is the estimated continuum intensity and @xmath19 is the intensity of the absorption line as a function of velocity .",
    "if the resolution of the instrument is very high compared to the fwhm of the absorption line , the apparent optical depth is a very good representation of the true optical depth .",
    "the apparent column density ( @xmath20 [ atoms @xmath0 ( km  s@xmath13)@xmath13 ] ) is calculated by the following relation    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the wavelength ( in  ) and _ f _ is the oscillator strength of the atomic species ( for o  vi , _ f _ value of 0.1325 has been adopted from @xcite ) .",
    "similar to @xcite , we find that the 1032   o  vi profile is broad and is fully resolved by _",
    "fuse_. however , the weaker absorption of the o  vi doublet at 1037.6   is found to be inseparable from the cii * and h@xmath15 absorption .",
    "the details of the apparent optical depth measurements are listed in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "the overlap of the o  vi absorption of the mw and the lmc does not allow a precise measurement of column densities for the lmc .",
    "for the lines of sight ( sk-65d21 , sk-67d69 , sk-67d105 , hv2543 , sk-66d100 , hv5936 , sk-67d211 , sk-69d220 , sk-66d172 , sk-68d137 , d301 - 1005 , and d301-nw8 ) where the lmc o  vi is distinct from the mw o  vi , the limits of velocities over which integration was performed were easy to obtain . taking cue from these lines of sight , we estimate the lower velocity limit for the lines of sight where the lmc o  vi was not separated from the mw o  vi . the errors in the equivalent widths and column densities are 1@xmath24 uncertainties derived using the uncertainty in the _ fuse _ data and the fitting procedures . the principal contributor to these errors is the ambiguity in the continuum fitting of several of the spectra .",
    "the lmc spectra were selected based on the quality of the spectra around o  vi spectral feature .",
    "the survey presented here has more - or - less complete coverage of the well known regions of the lmc such as 30 doradus , n11 , lmc 4 , etc . , and thus , is very useful in studying the variation of o  vi at small scales as well .",
    "we find a significant amount of variation in the o  vi column densities in a single region and in different regions of the lmc .",
    "our data cover a wide range of targets ; o type stars , b type stars , wolf - rayet objects , supernova remnants , etc .",
    "the complete list of the background targets is provided in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "these observations give fine details of the small scale structure of o  vi column density in the lmc probing to a scale of @xmath6 10 pc in some regions .",
    "we find the o  vi absorption in the lmc to be very patchy as is true for the mw .",
    "the o  vi column density varies from the lowest value of 5.28 @xmath25 atoms @xmath0 near a hii region ( dem 7 ) to the highest value of 3.74 @xmath26 atoms @xmath0 just north of the lmc bar .",
    "@xcite report the distribution of o  vi in the lmc to be patchy as well with the log  n(o  vi ) value in the lmc varying from 13.9 to 14.6 atoms @xmath0 and a mean of 14.37 atoms @xmath0 .",
    "their data did not provide any small scale variation in the column density of o  vi with the smallest scale probed is about 450500 pc .",
    "given the coverage of our data , we have studied the variation in o  vi absorption in different regions of the lmc .",

    "the mean and median values of log  n(o  vi ) for targets in and around 30 doradus and snr 1987a are 14.30 and 14.27 atoms @xmath0 respectively .",
    "30 doradus is the largest hii region of lmc with a dense concentration of early type massive stars and has thus , attracted extensive research in different wavelength bands @xcite .",
    "we discuss in detail about the o  vi distribution and its properties in 30 doradus region in section 5 .",
    "n11 region , which is associated with several ob associations and has a superbubble at its center , shows a high value of o  vi column density .",
    "the mean of log  n(o  vi ) in the n11 region is 14.21 atoms @xmath0 .",

    "other regions of the lmc also show patchiness in the o  vi distribution .",
    "statistically , the mean of the o  vi column density in the lmc is 1.88 @xmath26 atoms @xmath0 which is lower than 2.34 @xmath26 atoms @xmath0 given by howk et al .",

    "overall we find that there is an ubiquitous presence of o  vi throughout the lmc .",
    "the kinematics of o  vi in the lmc is difficult to study because of the ambiguity in separating the lmc o  vi absorption from the mw absorption .",

    "combining the @xcite and @xcite data for superbubble and non - superbubble lines of sight ( excluding sk-67d05 sightline ; see @xcite for details ) , the o  vi excess in superbubbles is about 46% , which is comparable to our results .",
    "thus , results reported here support and confirm that superbubbles do show higher o  vi abundance in comparison to the general halo absorption seen in other lmc lines of sight . some of the non - superbubble lines of sight show an enhanced o  vi column density owing to local effects .",
    "@xcite compared superbubble and non - superbubble lines of sight for the lmc and found that some quiescent environments showed an enhanced o  vi abundance , sometimes even larger than that of superbubbles .    even in a single superbubble , there are significant variations in the o  vi column densities .",
    "we have four observations each for the superbubbles 30 doradus c and n11 . in the case of 30 doradus c , we find that the variation in n(o  vi ) is more than a factor of 2 ( from the minimum value of n(o  vi ) to the maximum value ) . for n11",
    ", this variation is about a factor of 2.5 .",
    "the variation in n(o  vi ) for n70 is not much ( for the three lines of sight included here ) and this corroborates with the @xcite data .",
    "the 30 doradus region of the lmc is ideally suited to study the interaction between a high rate of star formation and the surrounding ism .",
    "this region is dominated by the star forming cluster ngc 2070 that contains the very interesting star cluster r136 at the center .",
    "the proximity to 30 doradus has allowed extensive research on the stellar content @xcite and initial mass function ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "30 doradus has also been investigated in detail in the infrared bands to study the dust properties @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the 30 doradus in the mid - infrared wavelength band to determine the physical conditions of the ionized gas and found that the local effects of hot stars in 30 doradus appear to dominate over any large - scale trend with distance from the central cluster r136 .",
    "the o  vi abundance in 30 doradus is higher than in other regions of the lmc with the highest value of log  n(o  vi ) being 14.56 atoms @xmath0 near the center of the cluster r136 .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows the change in the log  n(o  vi ) values from the center of r136 up to an angular distance of 1 degree .",
    "we find an overall decrease in the o  vi abundance away from the center of r136 .",
    "an interpretation of this plot could be that the processes involved in the formation of o  vi are likely to be associated with stellar radiation field but local effects can not be neglected on a large angular scale .",
    "it should be noted that we do not find any correlation between o  vi absorption and h@xmath1 emission for lmc and thus , no relation between star formation is established on a larger scale .    as noticed earlier , log  n(o  vi )",
    "does not correlate with x - ray emission for the lmc as a whole but surprisingly there is a good correlation for the 30 doradus lines of sight ( fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) .",
    "the correlation is between log  n(o  vi ) and x - ray emission from 30 doradus considering all the lines of sight within 1 degree around r136 except for one sightline ( sk-69d257 ) that has exceptionally high value of x - ray surface brightness .",
    "one of the reasons for such high x - ray emission from sk-69d257 is its proximity to a high mass x - ray binary lmc x-1 @xcite .",
    "the correlation in 30 doradus suggests that o  vi observed in this region is present in the ism gas surrounding the x - ray emitting plasma , which may be due to the compactness , high density and non - uniform structure of 30 doradus .",
    "the correlation confirms that the x - ray emitting gas cools through temperatures where o  vi is being formed and supports the general consensus about the formation of o  vi by collisional ionization in the interface regions between cooler photo - ionized ism gas and hot exterior ism gas @xcite .",
    "we have presented o  vi column density measurements for the lmc using _ fuse _ data for 70 lines of sight .",
    "this is the widest coverage of the lmc to date .",
    "the results reported here reveal significant variation in o  vi column densities over a very small angular scale thus confirming the patchiness of o  vi distribution in the lmc .",
    "the most important inferences drawn from this work are following :    1 .",
    "this survey probes 70 lines of sight with varying environmental conditions .",
    "we find strong o  vi absorption in the lmc that is not restricted to active regions .",
    "high o  vi abundance is present even in relatively inactive regions of the lmc .",
    "2 .   there are significant variations in the velocity profiles of o  vi absorption .",
    "the o  vi absorption profile is broader than the mw absorption for many lines of sight but it should be noted that unambiguous separation of the mw and the lmc components is not possible for most of the lines of sight .",
    "this proves to be a significant hurdle in interpreting exact kinematics for o  vi in the lmc ( for e.g. outflows from the lmc , etc . ) .",
    "the maximum column density measured for the lmc is log  n(o  vi ) = 14.57 atoms @xmath0 and minimum value is log  n(o  vi ) = 13.72 atoms @xmath0 . the mean value of o  vi column density is @xmath40log  n(o  vi)@xmath41 = 14.23 atoms @xmath0 , which is slightly lower than the earlier reported value .",
    "the median value of o  vi column density in the lmc comes to be 14.22 atoms @xmath0 .",
    "the results corroborates with the previous finding that the distribution of o  vi in the lmc is patchy .",
    "4 .   despite the fact that the lmc has lower metallicity than the mw , the abundance of o  vi and properties of o  vi absorption are similar in both the galaxies .",
    "the mean of log n@xmath29(o  vi ) value for the mw is 14.29 atoms @xmath0 while the projected column density for the lmc , i.e. , log n@xmath29(o  vi ) is 14.15 atoms @xmath0 . a more extensive study for the mw suggests this value to be 14.21 atoms @xmath0 .",
    "the smc with even lower metallicity has higher o  vi abundance with mean log  n(o  vi ) = 14.53 atoms @xmath0 . 5 .",
    "o  vi absorption in the lmc does not correlate with h@xmath1 ( warm gas ) or x - ray ( hot gas ) emission but we find a good correlation between o  vi absorption and x - ray emission in the 30 doradus region .",
    "it is also seen that the o  vi absorption is decreasing with increasing angular distance from the star cluster r136 suggesting some correlation with stellar radiation field .",
    "the observations reported cover 10 superbubbles of the lmc and for 5 superbubbles ( 30 doradus c , n158 , n51 , n11 and n57 ) o  vi absorption is reported for the first time .",
