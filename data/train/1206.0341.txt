    "a surface model for membranes is defined by a mapping @xmath0 from a two - dimensional surface @xmath4 to @xmath3 @xcite .",

    "however , the variable @xmath1 is always assumed to be the euclidean metric @xmath9 or the induced metric @xmath10 of the mapping @xmath0 in the numerical studies that have been performed so far @xcite . in those studies , the variable @xmath1 is fixed in the partition function , and as a consequence a role of @xmath1 in the phase structure of the model remains unclear .",
    "the metric @xmath1 of @xmath4 can be discretized as a variable by using the edge length of triangles in the regge calculus approach @xcite to the triangulated surface model .",
    "the model is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the gaussian bond potential and the bending energy , and @xmath14 $ ] is the bending rigidity @xcite . in this approach , one can see whether or not @xmath1 influences the discontinuous transition between the smooth phase at @xmath5 and the collapsed phase at @xmath15 .",

    "one of the non - trivial results reported in ref .",
    "is that the deficit angle varies almost discontinuously at the transition point , although the discontinuity is very small compared to the deficit angle itself .",
    "however , it is still unclear whether or not such a discontinuity in the internal geometric quantities can also be seen in the case where the edge length of triangles is fixed while the deficit angle is varied .",
    "moreover , it is also nontrivial whether the fluctuating metric influences the phase structure of the model with a constant metric .    in this paper",
    ", we study a surface model with a metric variable , which depends only on the deficit angle of triangles .",
    "since the surface is embedded in @xmath3 , the numerical simulation is more time consuming than that of the model in ref . .",
    "however , the metric is simplified by fixing the edge length @xmath18 of the triangle in @xmath4 such that @xmath19 , and hence the numerical simulations are greatly simplified compared to those for the model in ref . .",

    "<S> this continuous transition is reflected in almost discontinuous changes of the surface area of @xmath4 and that of @xmath8 , where the surface area of @xmath4 is conjugate to the density variable @xmath2 . </S>"
