    "in a recent paper schdel et al . reported a new set of data @xcite including the corrected old measurements @xcite on the projected positions of the star s2(s0 - 2 ) that was observed during the last decade with the eso telescopes in la silla ( chile ) .",
    "the combined data suggest that s2(s0 - 2)is moving on a keplerian orbit with a period of 15.2 yr around the enigmatic strong radiosource sgr a@xmath8 that is widely believed to be a black hole with a mass of about 2.6 @xmath3 10@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the salient feature of the new adaptive optics data is that , between april and may 2002 , s2(s0 - 2 ) apparently sped past the point of closest approach with a velocity @xmath10 @xmath11 6000 km / s at a distance of about 17 light - hours @xcite or 123 au from sgr a@xmath8 .    another star , s0 - 16 ( s14 ) , which was observed during the last few years by ghez et al .",
    "@xcite with the keck telescope in hawaii , made recently a spectacular u - turn , crossing the point of closest approach at an even smaller distance of 8.32 light - hours or 60 au from sgr a@xmath8 with a velocity @xmath10 @xmath11 9000 km / s .",
    "ghez et al . [ 4 ] thus conclude that the gravitational potential around sgr a@xmath8 has approximately @xmath12 form , for radii larger than 60 au , corresponding to 1169 schwarzschild radii of 26 light - seconds or 0.051 au for a 2.6 @xmath3 10@xmath9 black hole .",
    "although the baryonic alternatives are presumably ruled out , this still leaves some room for the interpretation of the supermassive compact dark object at the galactic center in terms of a finite - size non - baryonic dark matter object rather than a black hole .",
    "in fact , the supermassive black hole paradigm may eventually only be proven or ruled out by comparing it with credible alternatives in terms of finite - size non - baryonic objects @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore , using the example of a sterile neutrino as the dark matter particle candidate , the implications of the recent observations for the degenerate fermion ball scenario of the supermassive compact dark objects which was developed during the last decade @xcite .",
    "in a self - gravitating ball of degenerate fermionic matter , the gravitational pressure is balanced by the degeneracy pressure of the fermions due to the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "nonrelativistically , this scenario is described by the lane - emden equation with polytropic index @xmath13 .",
    "thus the radius @xmath14 and mass @xmath15 of a ball of self - gravitating , nearly non - interacting degenerate fermions scale as @xcite @xmath16^{1/3}}\\\\[.5 cm ]    & = & \\displaystyle{3610.66 \\ ; \\mbox{ld }    \\left ( \\frac{15 \\ ; \\mbox{kev}}{mc^{2 } }    \\right)^{8/3 } \\ ; \\left ( \\frac{2}{g } \\right)^{2/3 } \\ ;    \\left ( \\frac{m_{\\odot}}{m } \\right)^{1/3 } } \\ ; \\ ; .",
    "\\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here 1.19129 ld = 1 mpc = 206.265 au , and @xmath17 is the fermion mass .",
    "the degeneracy factor @xmath1 = 2 describes either spin 1/2 fermions ( without antifermions ) or spin 1/2 majorana fermions .",
    "( @xmath18 antifermions ) . for dirac fermions and antifermions , or spin 3/2 fermions ( without antifermions )",
    ", we have @xmath1 = 4 . using the canonical value @xmath19 and @xmath14 @xmath20 60 au for the supermassive compact dark object at the galactic center",
    ", we obtain a minimal fermion mass of @xmath21 = 76.0 kev/@xmath0 for @xmath1 = 2 , or @xmath21 = 63.9 kev/@xmath0 for @xmath1 = 4 .",
    "the maximal mass for a degenerate fermion ball , calculated in a general relativistic framework based on the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations , is the oppenheimer - volkoff ( ov ) limit @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 gev is the planck mass .",
    "thus , for @xmath21 = 76.0 kev/@xmath0 and @xmath1 = 2 , or @xmath21 = 63.9 kev/@xmath0 and @xmath1 = 4 , we obtain @xmath24 in this scenario all supermassive compact dark objects with mass @xmath25 must be black holes , while those with @xmath26 are fermion balls .",
    "choosing as the ov limit the canonical mass of the compact dark object at the center of the galaxy , @xmath27 = 2.6 @xmath3 10@xmath28 @xmath2 , yields a maximal fermion mass of @xmath29 = 491 kev/@xmath0 for @xmath1 = 2 , or @xmath29 = 413 kev/@xmath0 for @xmath1 = 4 . in this ultrarelativistic limit , there is little difference between the black hole and degenerate fermion ball scenarios , as the radius of the fermion ball is 4.45 compared to 3 schwarzschild radii for the radius of the event horizon of a non - rotating black hole of the same mass .",
    "in fact , varying the fermion mass between @xmath21 and @xmath29 , one can smoothly interpolate between a fermion ball of the largest acceptable size and a fermion ball of the smallest possible size , at the limit between fermion balls and black holes .",
    "the masses of the supermassive compact dark objects discovered so far at the centers of both active and inactive galaxies are all in the range @xcite @xmath30 thus , as @xmath31 falls into this range as well , we need both supermassive fermion balls ( @xmath26 ) and black holes ( @xmath25 ) to describe the observed phenomenology . at first sight , such a hybrid scenario does not seem to be particularly attractive .",
    "however , it is important to note that a similar scenario is actually realized in nature , with the co - existence of neutron stars which have masses @xmath32 , and stellar - mass black holes with mass @xmath33 , as observed in stellar binary systems in the galaxy @xcite . here",
    "the ov limit @xmath34 , which includes the nuclear interaction of the neutrons , is somewhat uncertain due to the unknown equation of state .",
    "but the consensus of the experts @xcite is that it must be in the range @xmath35 none of the observed neutron stars have masses larger than 1.4 @xmath2 , while there are at least nine candidates for stellar - mass black holes larger than 3 @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it is thus conceivable that nature allows for the co - existence of supermassive fermion balls and black holes as well .",
    "of course , we would expect characteristic differences in the properties of supermassive fermion balls and black holes .",
    "similarly , pulsars and stellar - mass black holes are quite different , as pulsars have a strong magnetic field and a hard baryonic surface , while black holes are surrounded by an immaterial event horizon instead .",
    "however , one may also argue that the astrophysical differences between supermassive black holes and fermion balls close to the ov limit are not so easy to detect because both objects are of non - baryonic nature .",
    "if the supermassive compact dark object at the galactic center is indeed a degenerate fermion ball of mass @xmath15 = 2.6 @xmath3 10@xmath9 and radius @xmath14 @xmath20 60 au , the fermion mass must be in the range @xmath36 63.9 \\ ; \\mbox{kev}/c^{2 } \\ ; \\leq \\ ; m \\ ; \\leq \\ ; 413 \\ ; \\mbox{kev}/c^{2 } \\ ; \\ ; \\mbox{for } \\ ; \\ ; g = 4 \\ ; \\ ; . \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it would be most economical if this particle could represent the dark matter particle of the universe , as well .",
    "in fact , it has been recently shown @xcite that an extended cloud of degenerate fermionic matter will eventually undergo gravitational collapse and form a degenerate supermassive fermion ball in a few free - fall times , if the collapsed mass is below the ov limit . during the formation",
    ", the binding energy of the nascent fermion ball is released in the form of high - energy ejecta at every bounce of the degenerate fermionic matter through a mechanism similar to gravitational cooling that is taking place in the formation of degenerate boson stars @xcite .",
    "if the mass of the collapsed object is above the ov limit , the collapse inevitably results in a supermassive black hole .",
    "the conjectured fermion could be a sterile neutrino @xmath37 which does not participate in the weak interactions .",
    "we will now assume that its mass and degeneracy factor is @xmath38 = 76.0 kev/@xmath0 and @xmath39 = 2 , corresponding to the largest fermion ball that is consistent with the stellar - dynamical constraints . in order to make sure that this fermion is actually produced in the early universe",
    "it must be mixed with at least one active neutrino , e.g. , the @xmath40 . indeed , for an electron neutrino asymmetry @xmath41 and a mixing angle @xmath42 @xcite , incoherent resonant and non - resonant active neutrino scattering in the early universe produces sterile neutrino matter amounting to the required fraction @xmath43 @xcite of the critical density of the universe today .",
    "here @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the electron neutrino , electron antineutrino and photon number densities , respectively .",
    "an electron neutrino asymmetry of @xmath47 is compatible with the observational limits on @xmath48he abundance , radiation density of the cosmic microwave background at decoupling , and formation of the large scale structure @xcite which constrain the electron neutrino asymmetry to the range @xmath49    within these limits , @xmath50 must be currently regarded as a free parameter which may be determined by future observations , in a similar way as the baryon asymmetry @xmath51 has been determined by big bang nucleosynthesis to @xmath52 = ( 2.6 - 6.2 ) @xmath3 10@xmath53 @xcite and by the cosmic microwave background radiation for @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "there is no reason to expect that @xmath50 and @xmath52 should be of the same order of magnitude .    at this stage",
    "it is interesting to note that incoherent resonant scattering of active neutrinos produces quasi - degenerate sterile neutrino matter , while incoherent non - resonant active neutrino scattering yields sterile neutrino matter that has approximately a thermal spectrum @xcite .",
    "quasi - degenerate sterile neutrino matter may contribute towards the formation of the supermassive compact dark objects at the galactic centers , while thermal sterile neutrino matter is mainly contributing to the dark matter of the galactic halos .",
    "the mixing of the sterile neutrino with at least one of the active neutrinos necessarily causes the main decay mode of the @xmath37 into three active neutrinos @xcite with a lifetime of @xmath55 which is presumably unobservable as the available neutrino energy is too small . here",
    "@xmath56 and @xmath57 are the lifetime and mass of the muon .",
    "however , there is a subdominant radiative decay mode of the sterile into an active neutrino and a photon with a branching ratio @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the fine structure constant .",
    "the lifetime of this potentially observable decay mode is thus @xmath60 yielding , for @xmath61 and @xmath38 = 76.0 kev/@xmath0 , a lifetime of @xmath62 yr .    although the x - ray luminosity due to the radiative decay of diffuse sterile neutrino dark matter in the universe is presumably not observable , because it is well below the x - ray background radiation at this energy @xcite , it is perhaps possible to detect such hard x - rays in the case of sufficiently concentrated dark matter objects .",
    "in fact , this could be the smoking gun for both the existence of the sterile neutrino and the fermion balls .",
    "for instance , a ball of @xmath63 consisting of degenerate sterile neutrinos of mass @xmath38 = 76.0 kev/@xmath0 @xcite , degeneracy factor @xmath39 = 2 , and mixing angle @xmath64 = 10@xmath65 would emit 38 kev photons with a luminosity @xmath66 within a radius of 60 au , 8.32 light hours or 7.6 @xmath3 10@xmath67 arcsec of sgr a@xmath8 , assumed to be at a distance of 8 kpc .",
    "the current upper limit for x - ray emission from the vicinity of sgr a@xmath8 is @xmath68 erg / s , for an x - ray energy of @xmath69 kev @xcite , where @xmath70 is the spectral luminosity .",
    "thus the x - ray line at 38 kev could presumably only be detected if either the angular or the energy resolution or both , of the present x - ray detectors are increased .",
