    "for the past few decades , gravity of cosmic strings and gravitational waves from them have been investigated by many researchers@xcite@xcite .",
    "there are two physical contexts to investigate gravity of cosmic strings .",
    "one is the cosmological context and another is in the technical problem in general relativity : the treatment of concentrated line sources .    in the cosmological context ,",
    "cosmic strings are topological defects associated with the symmetry breaking in unified theories@xcite . in the simplest case , the dynamics of cosmic strings",
    "is governed by the nambu - goto action .",
    "if the self - gravity of strings is ignored ( test string case ) , the nambu - goto action admits oscillatory solutions .",
    "it is considered that these oscillations lead the emission of gravitational waves and strings gradually lose their kinetic energy by this emission@xcite .",
    "further , relic gravitational waves emitted by cosmic strings might be detectable by the gravitational wave detectors to be constructed in the near future@xcite . though this is a quite fascinating prediction , it is not clear whether or not it can be taken seriously . recently , by taking into account the self - gravity of the nambu - goto string , it is shown that the oscillatory behavior of a self - gravitating string coupled to gravitational wave is quite different from that of a test string@xcite .",
    "the dynamical degree of freedom concerning the perturbative oscillations of an infinite string is completely determined by that of gravitational waves and a self - gravitating infinite string does not oscillate spontaneously unlike an infinite test string .    to give a completely precise dynamics of gravitating cosmic strings",
    ", we must solve the einstein equations and the evolution equations of the higgs and gauge fields from generic initial data , which is impossible at present .",
    "so it will be instructive to replace a cosmic string by a concentrated line source and clarify its gravity at first@xcite .",
    "however , it is known that the mathematical description of a self - gravitating thin string is delicate because the support of a string is a surface of co - dimension two . in general relativity , there is no simple prescription of an arbitrary concentrated line source where the metric becomes singular@xcite .    in spite of these difficulties , a conical singularity , which appears in some exact solutions to the einstein equations ,",
    "is often regarded as a self - gravitating cosmic string .",
    "( for example , see ref.@xcite . )",
    "this is one of the idealizations of the concentrated matter sources .",
    "since a spacetime containing a straight gauge string has the asymptotically conical structure@xcite , this idealization seems plausible when the string thickness is much smaller than the other physical scale of interests .    as an extension of this idealization",
    ", one might expect that an oscillating cosmic string can be also idealized by an oscillating conical singularity .",
    "however , as pointed out by unruh et al.@xcite , the worldsheet of a conical singularity is totally geodesic .",
    "this behavior is also seen in the time symmetric initial data of gravity of a loop conical singularity@xcite and similar results are also obtained in refs.@xcite .",
    "the dynamics of conical singularities is completely determined without their equations of motion .",
    "this geodesic property of a conical singularity shows that the idealization of cosmic strings by conical singularities might gives the different dynamics from that of cosmic strings in the early universe which have their finite thickness .",
    "further , this implies that the dynamics of cosmic strings is not idealized by that of conical singularities , though it seems natural to expect that loops of cosmic string can be regarded as conical singularities when the loop radius is much larger than the string thickness .    in this paper ,",
    "we reconsider the above geodesic property pointed out in ref.@xcite using a time symmetric initial data containing a thick loop string .",
    "we show that the zero thickness of strings is essential to this geodesic property . because of the singular metric , gravity near the loop conical singularity is so strong that the loop itself is a geodesic on the initial surface . on the other hand ,",
    "the core of the thick loop string is not a geodesic on the initial surface and the curvature of a test loop on a flat space is naturally reproduced in the limit @xmath2 where @xmath3 is newton s gravitational constant .",
    "then , the geodesic property in ref.@xcite should not be taken seriously when we consider the dynamics of cosmic strings , since cosmic strings in the early universe have their own finite thickness .",
    "this also implies that we must take into account the effect of the string thickness when we discuss the dynamics of cosmic strings .",
    "this behavior of the gravity of a thick string loop also suggests that there is a criterion in the string thickness at which the linear perturbation theory around a flat background spacetime fails to describe the gravity of cosmic strings .",
    "we call this thickness `` _ critical thickness _ '' and evaluate this criterion in this paper . the geodesic property in ref.@xcite does not depend on the loop radius and its deficit angle . when the spacetime contains a sufficiently small loop conical singularity ,",
    "this loop is a geodesic on this spacetime and the other geodesics on this spacetime are quite different from those on the flat spacetime , on which geodesics are straight lines . on the other hand , gravity of a thick loop string",
    "is not so strong as mentioned above .",
    "this suggests that the linear gravity is plausible if the string is sufficiently thick .",
    "then , for a fixed loop radius and a fixed deficit angle , there exists a critical thickness and the linear gravity on a flat background spacetime is valid if the string thickness is much greater than this critical thickness .    to discuss the initial data of the gravity of a thick string loop and evaluate the above critical thickness",
    ", we first construct an example of the initial data in which the matter concentrates on the torus shell . since the gravity of a cosmic string has asymptotically conical structure , we use the initial data derived by frolov et al.@xcite as a solution outside the torus . using this example",
    ", we explicitly show that the core of the loop string is not a geodesic if the string has its finite thickness , while the loop approaches to a geodesic in the zero - thickness limit .",
    "though the matter distribution in this example is too artificial as a realistic cosmic string loop , our conclusion is also true even if the matter distribution is smooth .",
    "our example also shows that the initial data derived by frolov et al.@xcite may be regarded as the gravitational field produced by a smooth matter distribution .",
    "so , using this initial data as the geometry outside the matter field , we derive the above critical thickness of a string by comparing with a linear solution on the flat space background .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec.[sec : general - formalizm ] , we briefly review the adm initial constraints and the treatment of the @xmath4-function distribution of the matter field on the initial surface to construct an example of the gravitational field produced by a loop matter distribution . in sec.[sec : loop - thick - string - initial ] , we construct an initial data of a thick loop string and discuss whether the string is a geodesic on the initial surface or not . we discuss the above critical thickness in sec.[sec : liniear ] . the final section ( sec.[sec : disucssion ] )",
    "is devoted to summary and discussions .    throughout this paper",
    "we work in relativistic units , so that the speed of light is equal to unity .",
    "in 4-dimensional spacetime @xmath5 , we consider a zero extrinsic curvature 3-dimensional spacelike submanifold @xmath6 .",
    "we denote the unit normal vector of @xmath7 in @xmath8 by @xmath9 .",
    "the induced metric @xmath10 on @xmath7 from the metric @xmath11 on @xmath8 is given by @xmath12 .",
    "the zero extrinsic curvature means the spacetime is momentarily static at @xmath6 .",
    "the adm initial - value constraints for a momentarily static hypersurface @xmath6 are reduced to@xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the ricci scalar curvature of @xmath7 and @xmath15 is the energy density of the matter field on the hypersurface @xmath7 . in terms of a conformally transformed metric @xmath16 , the constraint ( [ hamiltonian_constraint-1 ] ) is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the covariant derivative and the scalar curvature associated with the metric @xmath20 , respectively . in this paper , we concentrate only on the geometry of @xmath7 using the constraint ( [ hamiltonian - constraint-2 ] ) ( or ( [ hamiltonian_constraint-1 ] ) ) .    for simplicity ,",
    "we consider @xmath4-function distribution of matter energy density at the 2-dimensional hypersurface @xmath21 on @xmath7 to construct an example of solutions to eq.([hamiltonian - constraint-2 ] ) .",
    "to treat @xmath4-function distribution of the matter energy , we apply israel s condition@xcite on the initial surface , which is derived from the constraint ( [ hamiltonian - constraint-2 ] ) . to derive this condition",
    ", we first divide @xmath6 into two manifolds @xmath22 with the boundaries @xmath23 and then identify @xmath24 .",
    "this identification implies @xmath25 , where @xmath26 are the unit normal vector of @xmath23 on @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the induced metrics @xmath28 on @xmath23 from @xmath29 are given by @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "since @xmath23 are diffeomorphic to each other , @xmath28 satisfy the condition @xmath31    by virtue of the constraint ( [ hamiltonian_constraint-1 ] ) , the @xmath4-function distribution of the matter energy density also gives the gap of the extrinsic curvatures @xmath32 of @xmath23 facing to @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath32 are defined by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the covariant derivative associated with the metric @xmath10 . introducing the gaussian normal coordinate @xmath35 in the neighborhood of @xmath21 by @xmath36 , the scalar curvature @xmath14 on @xmath7 is decomposed as follows : @xmath37 when @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 the integration of ( [ hamiltonian_constraint-1 ] ) over the infinitesimal interval of @xmath35 yields @xmath40 hence all conditions for the identification @xmath41 on the momentarily static initial data are ( [ constraint - junction - intrinsic ] ) and ( [ constraint - junction - extrinsic ] ) .",
    "here , we consider a momentarily static initial data of gravity produced by a thick loop string . in this paper , we assume that the vacuum region outside the loop is given by the initial data for a loop conical singularity derived by frolov et al.@xcite as mentioned in the introduction ( sec.[sec : introduction ] ) . in this section ,",
    "we first review the conformally flat version of the initial data for a loop conical singularity in ref.@xcite .",
    "second , replacing the conical singularity by a matter distribution , we construct an example of a gravitating thick loop string",
    ". then we discuss whether the loop is a geodesic on the initial surface or not .",
    "though we concentrate only on a conformally flat initial data , the similar behavior is also seen in the conformally non - flat version .",

    "thus , the inside matter torus shell , the orbit of @xmath95 is not a geodesic on the whole initial surface @xmath7 if a string has its finite thickness .",
    "when the torus shell of the matter field is sufficiently thin ( @xmath110 ) , @xmath118 behaves @xmath126 this shows that the limit torus approaches to a geodesic on the initial surface @xmath6 as the string thickness approaches to zero , which is the similar situation to eq.([frolov - israel - unrhu - kappa ] ) .",
    "eq.([kappa - inside - thin - string ] ) also shows that @xmath127 when the outside deficit angle vanishes ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "this is the `` acceleration '' of the loop with the radius @xmath1 on a flat space , i.e. , a test string .",
    "thus , only by introducing the string thickness , we have obtained the natural behavior of @xmath118 which includes the case of a conical singularity and that of a test string .",
    "hence , we may say that the zero thickness of a string is the essential reason of the geodesic properties obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "though the matter distribution in sec.([sec : thick - initial ] ) is too artificial for a gauge string loop , we may say that a cosmic string loop is not a geodesic if the loop has its finite proper length and if its energy density does not diverge at the core of the string ( @xmath53 ) . from the metric ( [ physical - three - metric ] ) , the proper length of the killing orbit of @xmath95 is @xmath128 .",
    "the core @xmath53 has a finite proper length only when @xmath129 . in this case , the right hand side of eq.([hamiltonian - constraint-2 ] ) behaves @xmath130 together with the hamiltonian constraint ( [ hamiltonian - constraint-2 ] ) , eq.([order - of - tpp ] ) yields that the energy density @xmath38 of matter fields does not contribute to @xmath131 nor @xmath132 of the conformal factor @xmath91 unless @xmath38 diverges at @xmath53 .",
    "when we solve eq.([hamiltonian - constraint-2 ] ) , we should impose the boundary conditions ( i ) , ( ii ) and @xmath92 from the regularity at the limit torus .",
    "then , the asymptotic form of @xmath107 in eq.([phi+phi - asympt ] ) is true up to the order of @xmath133 even if we consider the smooth distribution of @xmath38 .",
    "further , @xmath123 and @xmath124 in eq.([phi+phi - asympt ] ) remain constants .",
    "these constants @xmath123 and @xmath124 are determined by the boundary conditions at the surface of the matter distribution or the asymptotically flatness at the infinity as in our torus shell model .",
    "then , we obtain eq.([kappa - vacuum ] ) , again .",
    "thus , the limit torus @xmath53 must not be a geodesic even if the distribution of @xmath38 is smooth and a loop string has its finite proper length .",
    "in the last section , we have seen a thick loop energy distribution is not a geodesic on the initial surface , while a loop conical singularity is .",
    "the example in the last section also shows that the initial data derived in ref.@xcite may be regarded as the gravitational field produced a smooth matter distribution .",
    "further , as mentioned in the introduction ( sec.[sec : introduction ] ) , this also suggests that , for the fixed loop radius , there exists a criterion in the string thickness of the validity of a linear gravity .",
    "we call `` _ critical thickness _ ''",
    ". this critical thickness can be evaluated by the discrepancy of a linear gravity from the initial data in the previous section .",
    "the solution to the linearized hamiltonian constraint is derived by choosing the line element on @xmath7 so that @xmath134 the linearized hamiltonian constraint ( [ hamiltonian - constraint-2 ] ) is given by @xmath135 in the leading order of @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is the laplacian on the flat space .",
    "this is just newton s equation of gravity .",
    "however , we should comment that cosmic string does not generate the usual newton potential in the linearized einstein gravity because of its huge tension .",
    "we must note that @xmath136 in ( [ newton - eq ] ) does not have the usual meaning of the newton potential .",
    "we consider the matter energy density distribution given by @xmath138 .",

    "to derive this solution ( [ newton - pot ] ) , we identified the line energy density @xmath139 with the hiscock mass @xmath143@xcite .    comparing with eq.([asymptotic - metric ] ) and eq.([newton - line - element ] )",
    ", we easily see that @xmath144 coincides with @xmath136 in the asymptotically flat region @xmath145 . as an example , @xmath146 and @xmath136 on the equatorial plane with @xmath147",
    "are shown in fig.[fig : fig3 ] .",
    "we evaluate the validity of the linear perturbation theory with the flat space background by @xmath148 at the same circumference radius of the killing orbit of @xmath95 .",
    "we evaluate @xmath4 on the equatorial plane ( @xmath51 or @xmath149 ) .",
    "the discrepancy @xmath4 diverges at the locus of the loop due to the divergence in @xmath136 : @xmath150 while @xmath151 in the asymptotically flat region .",
    "this means that @xmath4 becomes order of unity at some points .",
    "these points give the `` critical thickness '' .",
    "if the string thickness is smaller than this critical thickness , we may regard that the linear perturbation theory on a flat space fails to describe gravity of a loop string .",
    "now , we evaluate this criterion .",
    "there are two circumference radii on the equatorial plane at which @xmath152 .",
    "we denote these by @xmath153 .",
    "@xmath154 is in the region @xmath155 ( @xmath156 ) and",
    "@xmath154 is in @xmath157 ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "we evaluate the critical thickness in the string thickness by @xmath159 .",
    "if a loop string has the larger thickness than @xmath160 , we may regard that the linear perturbation with a flat space background is plausible .",
    "the critical thickness @xmath160 for each deficit angle are shown in fig.[fig : fig4 ] .",
    "fig.[fig : fig4 ] shows that the linear perturbation theory with a flat space background is plausible when its thickness is larger than @xmath161 for @xmath162 ( gut string case ) .",
    "this critical thickness is also roughly estimated as follows : the divergence in @xmath4 is due to the logarithmic one in @xmath163 . since @xmath164 and @xmath165 near the loop , we obtain @xmath166 for @xmath167 . though this estimation is about one quarter of the result shown in fig.[fig : fig4 ] , it will be due to higher order corrections in @xmath136 or @xmath146 .",
    "we have considered the initial data of gravity produced by a loop string and showed that the core of a thick string is not a geodesic on the initial surface , while a loop conical singularity is . to see this",
    ", we first consider an example in which the matter concentrates on the torus surface .",
    "this geodesic property is unchanged if a loop string has its finite proper length and the matter energy density does not diverge .",
    "then , we may say that the geodesic property obtained in ref.@xcite should not be taken seriously when we consider the dynamics of cosmic strings in the early universe , because realistic cosmic strings have their own finite thickness .",
    "further , using the above example , we have seen that the loop approaches to a geodesic on the initial surface in the zero thickness limit .",
    "this behavior in our example also suggests that the metric perturbation on a flat space background loses its validity when a string is sufficiently thin .",
    "we also considered the critical thickness which is the criterion of the validity of the linear gravity around a flat space background .",
    "we evaluate this criterion using the circumference radii at which the discrepancy @xmath4 defined by eq.([delta - def ] ) becomes unity .",
    "fig.[fig : fig4 ] shows that a linear perturbation is plausible when the string thickness is larger than @xmath168 where @xmath1 is the string bending scale .",
    "it is not clear from the arguments in this paper whether all behaviors of the `` acceleration '' @xmath118 of the killing orbit in our example are maintained in generic situations . to confirm this",
    ", we must solve the hamiltonian constraint ( [ hamiltonian - constraint-2 ] ) with smooth matter energy distribution , numerically .",
    "however , we expect that these are also true even when the matter distribution is smooth because the coefficients @xmath123 and @xmath124 in eq.([kappa - vacuum ] ) are completely determined by the regularity at the limit torus and the asymptotically conical structure .",
    "fig.[fig : fig3](a ) also shows that there is the discrepancy of @xmath136 and @xmath146 in the region near loop axis @xmath51",
    ". this will be due to the degree of freedom of gravitational waves on the initial surface .",
    "this speculation is also suggested the fact that the usual newton potential does not generated by a cosmic string because of its huge tension as commented in the previous section . to confirm this speculation",
    ", we must solve the time evolution from this initial data .",
    "however , @xmath4 in this region is smaller than unity and this discrepancy will be described by the linear perturbation with the minkowski spacetime background .",
    "so this discrepancy is not important for the above criterion .    in ref.@xcite , we discussed the dynamics of a fluctuating infinite string and showed that the displacement of a string vanishes for a zero thickness string .",
    "these results in ref.@xcite is due to the same situation discussed here . from the viewpoint of the idealization problem of",
    "concentrated line sources in general relativity , we may say that the thickness should be remained finite when we investigate the dynamics of self - gravitating strings and their gravitational wave emission .",
    "we must note that our conclusion here does not contradict to our conclusion in ref.@xcite : there is no dynamical degree of freedom of the free oscillations of a nambu - goto string within the first order with respect to its oscillation amplitude . in ref.@xcite",
    ", we have carefully excluded the gauge freedom of perturbations .",
    "the result obtained here suggests that we may use the linear perturbation theory with minkowski background if the string thickness is much larger than the above critical thickness , though we must bear in our mind that the effect of higgs and gauge fields constructing cosmic string will dominate in a realistic cosmic string . in this case",
    ", we have to exclude gauge freedom of the perturbations carefully as in ref.@xcite .",
    "this will be our future work .",
    "finally , we must also comment that our arguments here and in ref.@xcite are those for a string in the situation where its bending scale is much larger than its thickness .",
    "so , from the conclusion here , we can not say anything about the geometry of near cusps or kinks , which may arise in the complex dynamics of cosmic strings@xcite .",
    "when cusps or kinks appear by the dynamics from large loop , we will have to take into account the dynamics of higgs and gauge fields .",
    "this will be not the problem in general relativity but the field theory itself .",

    "since the coefficients @xmath94 in eq.([an_in_cnf - version ] ) are constants determined by the locus of the torus matter shell , we conclude that the limit torus @xmath53 is not a geodesic on @xmath6 . as in the case in sec.[sec : is - a - loop - string - is - geodesic ] , when the matter torus shell is sufficiently thin ( @xmath110 ) , @xmath118 behaves @xmath203 where @xmath204 is the proper distance from @xmath125 to the limit torus @xmath53 .",
    "eq.([kappa - conformally - nonflat - asympt ] ) shows that when the thickness of the string is sufficiently smaller than its curvature radius ( @xmath205 ) , the loop approaches to a geodesic on @xmath6 .",
