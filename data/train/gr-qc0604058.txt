    "it is by now well established that the physics associated with classical and quantum fields in curved spacetimes can be reproduced , within certain approximations , in a variety of different physical systems  the so - called `` analogue models of general relativity ( gr ) ''  @xcite .",
    "the simplest example of such a system is provided by acoustic disturbances propagating in a barotropic , irrotational and viscosity - free fluid . in the context of analogue models",
    "it is natural to separate the kinematical aspects of gr from the dynamical ones . in general , within a sufficiently complex analogue model one can reproduce any pre - specified spacetime  and the kinematics of fields evolving on it  independently of whether or not it satisfies the classical ( or semiclassical ) einstein equations  @xcite .",
    "indeed , to date there are no analogue models whose effective geometry is determined by einstein equations . in this sense",
    "we currently have both analogue spacetimes and analogues of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes , but ( strictly speaking ) no analogue model for gr itself  @xcite . in order to reproduce a specific spacetime geometry within an analogue model",
    ", one would have to take advantage of the specific equations describing the latter ( for example , for fluid models , the euler and continuity equations , together with an equation of state ) , plus the possibility of manipulating the system by applying appropriate external forces . in the analysis of this paper",
    "we will think of the spacetime configuration as `` externally given '' , assuming that it has been set up as desired by external means  any back - reaction on the geometry is neglected as in principle we can counter - balance its effects using the external forces . in the context of analogue models",
    "this is not merely a hypothesis introduced solely for theoretical simplicity , but rather a realistic situation that is in principle quite achievable .",
    "specifically , in this paper we analyze in simple terms the issue of quantum quasi - particle creation by several externally specified @xmath1-dimensional analogue geometries simulating the formation of black hole - like configurations .",
    "( in a previous companion paper  @xcite we investigated the causal structure of these , and other , spacetimes . ) in this analysis we have in mind , on the one hand , the possibility of setting up laboratory experiments exhibiting hawking - like radiation  @xcite and , on the other hand , the acquisition of new insights into the physics of black hole evaporation in semiclassical gravity .",
    "all the discussion holds for a scalar field obeying the dalembert wave equation in a curved spacetime .",
    "this means that we are not ( for current purposes ) considering the deviations from the phononic dispersion relations that show up at high energies owing to the atomic structure underlying any condensed matter system .",
    "we shall briefly comment on these modifications at the end of the paper . for simplicity , throughout the paper",
    "we adopt a terminology based on acoustics in moving fluids ( we will use terms such as acoustic spacetimes , sonic points , fluid velocity , etc . ) , but our results are far more general and apply to many other analogue gravity models not based on acoustics .",
    "we summarise the main conclusions below .",
    "first of all , we recover the standard hawking result when considering fluid flows that generate a supersonic regime at finite time .",
    "( that is , we recover a stationary creation of quasi - particles with a planckian spectrum . )",
    "we then analyze the quasi - particle creation associated with other types of configurations .",
    "in particular , we shall discuss in detail a `` critical black hole ''  a flow configuration that presents an acoustic horizon without an associated supersonic region . from this analysis",
    "we want to highlight two key results :    * the existence of a supersonic regime ( sound velocity @xmath2 strictly smaller than fluid velocity @xmath3 ) is not needed in order to reproduce hawking s stationary particle creation .",
    "we demonstrate this fact by calculating the quantity of quasi - particle production in an evolving geometry which generates only an isolated sonic point ( @xmath0 ) , but without a supersonic region , in a finite amount of laboratory time .",
    "* moreover , in order to produce a hawking - like effect it is not even necessary to generate a sonic point at finite time .",
    "all one needs is that a sonic point develops in the asymptotic future ( that is , for @xmath4 ) _ with sufficient rapidity _ ( we shall explain in due course what we exactly mean by this ) .    from the point of view of the reproducibility of a hawking - like effect in a laboratory , the latter result is particularly interesting . in general , the formation of a supersonic regime in a fluid flow  normally considered to be the crucial requirement to produce hawking emission  is associated with various different types of instability ( landau instability in superfluids , quantized vortex formation in bose ",
    "einstein condensates , etc . ) that could mask the hawking effect . to reproduce a hawking - like effect without invoking a supersonic regime",
    "could alleviate this situation . from the point of view of gr",
    ", we believe that our result could also have some relevance , as it suggests a possible alternative scenario for the formation and semiclassical evaporation of black hole - like objects .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in the next section we introduce the various acoustic spacetimes on which we focus our attention , spacetimes that describe the formation of acoustic black holes of different types . in section  [ sec :",
    "creation ] we present separately the specific calculations of redshift for sound rays that pass asymptotically close to the event horizon of these black holes . by invoking standard techniques of quantum field theory in curved spacetime , one can then immediately say when particle production with a planckian spectrum takes place . finally , in the last section of the paper we summarise and discuss the results obtained .",
    "associated with the flow of a barotropic , viscosity - free fluid along an infinitely long thin pipe , with density and velocity fields constant on any cross section orthogonal to the pipe , there is a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional _ acoustic spacetime _",
    "@xmath5 , where the manifold @xmath6 is diffeomorphic to @xmath7 . using the laboratory time @xmath8 and physical distance @xmath9 along the pipe",
    "as coordinates on @xmath6 , the _ acoustic metric _ on @xmath6 can be written as@xmath10 = \\omega^2\\left[-c^2\\,d t^2 + ( \\d x+v\\,\\d t)^2\\right ] \\;,\\label{metric}\\]]where @xmath2 is the speed of sound , @xmath3 is the fluid velocity , and @xmath11 is an unspecified non - vanishing function  @xcite . in general , all these quantities depend on the laboratory coordinates @xmath12 and @xmath13 . here",
    ", we shall assume that @xmath2 is a constant .",
    "hence , it is the velocity @xmath14 that contains all the relevant information about the causal structure of the acoustic spacetime @xmath5 .",
    "we direct the reader to the companion paper  @xcite for a detailed analysis of the causal structure associated with a broad class of @xmath1-dimensional acoustic geometries , both static and dynamic .      the sonic points , where @xmath15 , correspond to the so - called acoustic apparent horizons  apparent horizons for the lorentzian geometry defined on @xmath6 by the metric ( [ metric ] ) .",
    "the fact of having an underlying minkowski structure associated with the laboratory observer makes the definition of apparent horizons in acoustic models less troublesome than in gr ( see  reference @xcite , pp .",
    "consider a monotonically non - decreasing function @xmath16 such that @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "if one chooses @xmath20 in ( [ metric ] ) , the corresponding acoustic spacetime represents , for observers with @xmath21 , a static black hole with the horizon located at @xmath22 ( in this case apparent and event horizon coincide ) , a black hole region for @xmath23 , and a ( right - sided ) surface gravity@xmath24we can , moreover , distinguish three cases :    * @xmath25 and @xmath26 for @xmath23 : a non - extremal black hole ; * @xmath25 and @xmath27 for @xmath23 : a `` critical '' black hole ; * @xmath28 and @xmath27 for @xmath23 : an extremal black hole .",
    "now , taking the above @xmath16 , let us consider @xmath13-dependent velocity functions@xmath29with @xmath30 a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath13 , such that @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "( the first condition serves to guarantee that spacetime is flat at early times , whereas we impose the second one only for simplicity . all the analysis in the paper",
    "could be performed without adopting this assumption , leaving the physical results unchanged . however , that would require more case - by - case splitting , only to cover new situations without physical interest . )",
    "there are basically two possibilities for @xmath30 , according to whether the value @xmath33 is attained for a finite laboratory time @xmath34 or asymptotically for an infinite future value of laboratory time . in the first case @xmath35 and the corresponding metric ( [ metric ] ) represents the formation of a non - extremal , critical , or extremal black hole , respectively . for small values of @xmath36",

    "hence the function @xmath30 behaves , qualitatively , as shown in figure  [ f : xi - bh ] .",
    "apart from this feature , the detailed behaviour of @xmath30 is largely irrelevant for our purposes . if instead @xmath39 is attained only at infinite future time , that is @xmath40 , one is describing the asymptotic formation of either a critical black hole ( if @xmath41 ; obviously , in this case choosing the non - extremal or the critical @xmath42 profile is irrelevant ) or an extremal black hole ( if @xmath28 ) .",
    "now the function @xmath30 behaves , qualitatively , as shown in figure  [ f : xi - cbh ] .",
    "the relevant feature of @xmath43 is its asymptotic behaviour as @xmath44 . in the following",
    "we shall consider two possibilities for this asymptotics , although others can , of course , be envisaged :    exponential : @xmath45 , with @xmath46 a positive constant , in general different from @xmath47 , and @xmath48 ;    power law : @xmath49 , with @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "for all the situations considered so far , spacetime is minkowskian in the two asymptotic regions corresponding to @xmath52 , and to @xmath4 , @xmath19 ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively , adopting the notation of reference  @xcite ) . starting with a quantum scalar field in its natural minkowskian vacuum at @xmath52 ,",
    "we want to know the total quantity of quasi - particle production to be detected at the right asymptotic region at late times , @xmath4 , caused by the dynamical evolution of the velocity profile @xmath14 . in the geometric acoustic approximation ,",
    "a right - going sound ray is an integral curve of the differential equation@xmath55we are interested in sound rays propagating from @xmath56 ( see figure  [ f : conf - bh ] ) ; that is , in solutions of ( [ diffeq ] ) that satisfy an initial condition @xmath57 , with @xmath58 in the limit @xmath59 ( so @xmath60 can be thought of as an `` initial '' event corresponding to the emission of the acoustic signal ) .",
    "if such a ray ends up on @xmath61 , we can identify `` final '' events @xmath62 on it , with @xmath63 as @xmath64 . for a ray connecting @xmath53 to @xmath54 one can also find an event @xmath65 such that @xmath66 , which corresponds to the crossing of the `` kink '' in @xmath3 , located at @xmath67 according to equation ( [ velocity ] ) , by the sound signal . finally , we can define , for such a ray , two parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 as follows:@xmath70@xmath71such parameters correspond to null coordinates in spacetime .",
    "if an acoustic event horizon @xmath72 is present in the spacetime , the coordinate @xmath68 is regular on it ( , @xmath68 attains some finite value on @xmath72 ) , whereas @xmath69 tends to @xmath73 as @xmath74 is approached .",
    "we can express both @xmath68 and @xmath69 in terms of the velocity profile ( shape and dynamics ) and of the crossing time @xmath75 .",
    "to this end , we can integrate equation ( [ diffeq ] ) , first between @xmath76 and @xmath77:@xmath78then between @xmath77 and @xmath79:@xmath80on replacing @xmath81 from equation ( [ xi - x ] ) into ( [ u ] ) , we find the value of @xmath68 for a generic right - moving ray that crosses the kink at laboratory time @xmath75:@xmath82similarly , substituting @xmath83 from equation ( [ t - t ] ) into ( [ u ] ) , then adding and subtracting the quantity @xmath84 , we find@xmath85 in the analysis below , our chief goal consists of finding the relation between @xmath68 and @xmath69 for a sound ray that is close to the horizon , , in the asymptotic regime @xmath86 .",
    "from such a relation it is then a standard procedure to find the bogoliubov @xmath87 coefficients and hence the total quasi - particle content to be measured , in this case , by an asymptotic observer at @xmath54 .",
    "( see , for example , reference  @xcite ) . in the case of an exponential relation between @xmath68 and @xmath69 it is a well established result that a planckian spectrum is observed at late times  @xcite , so hawking - like radiation will be recovered .",
    "when the apparent horizon forms at a finite laboratory time , say at @xmath88 , an event horizon always exists , generated by the right - moving ray that eventually remains frozen on the apparent horizon , at @xmath22 .",
    "for such a ray @xmath89 , and since @xmath35 , the @xmath68 parameter has the finite value@xmath90for a ray with @xmath91 we then obtain , combining equations ( [ uu ] ) and ( [ uh - fin]):@xmath92this _ exact _ equation is now in a form suitable for conveniently extracting _ approximate _ results in the region @xmath93 , corresponding to sound rays that `` skim '' the horizon .    on the other hand , when the trapping horizon consists of just one single sonic point located at @xmath94 , it is not obvious that an event horizon exists . loosely speaking ,",
    "in this case it might happen that the trapping horizon form `` after '' every right - going ray from @xmath53 has managed to cross @xmath22 . since there is a competition between two infinite quantities  the time at which the trapping horizon forms , and the time at which the `` last '' right - going signal that connects @xmath95 with @xmath96 crosses @xmath22  a careful case - by - case analysis is in order .",
    "this is essentially all that can be said without relying on specific features of @xmath16 .",
    "we now consider separately the various situations of interest , focussing first on the issue of the existence of the event horizon .      in the case of a non - extremal black hole ,",

    "value @xmath101 of the coordinate @xmath68 .",
    "hence , in this situation an event horizon always exists .",
    "this is also clear from the fact that the vertical half - line @xmath22 , @xmath102 in figure  [ f : tx - bh ] is an apparent horizon .",
    "the function @xmath16 behaves as shown in figure  [ f : v - cbh ] .",
    "regarding the right side of the profile , @xmath21 , it is indistinguishable from the profile of a non - extremal black hole ( figure  [ f : v - bh ] ) .      when the function @xmath43 is of the form ( [ appxi - bh ] ) , that is , when the apparent horizon is formed at a finite amount of laboratory time , the situation is exactly the same as for the non - extremal black hole discussed above .",
    "consider now that the sonic point is approached in an infinite amount of time , so the function @xmath43 behaves as in figure  [ f : xi - cbh ] .",
    "the worldlines of right - moving sound rays are shown in figure  [ f : tx - cbh ] .",
    "as in the formation of the non - critical black hole , the portion of the diagram to the right of the curve @xmath67 ( , to the right of the moving kink in the velocity profile ) corresponds to a static spacetime , and for @xmath52 the geometry is minkowskian  the worldlines tend to approach straight lines with slope @xmath99 .",
    "however , now the apparent horizon is just the asymptotic point located at @xmath22 , @xmath4 , and in order to establish whether an event horizon does , or does not , exist one must perform an actual calculation of @xmath101 for the `` last '' ray that crosses the kink .",
    "the expression for @xmath101 is again obtained from equation ( [ uu ] ) , noticing that now @xmath103 along the generator of the would - be horizon , so@xmath104the necessary and sufficient condition for the event horizon to exist is that the limit on right hand side of equation ( [ baru - cbh ] ) be finite .",
    "the integrand on right hand side of ( [ baru - cbh ] ) can be approximated , for @xmath105 , as @xmath106 , while for @xmath52 it just approaches zero .",
    "hence @xmath101 is , up to a finite constant , equal to @xmath107 times the integral of @xmath30 , evaluated at @xmath108 . here",

    "approaching zero from positive values we can write@xmath110where @xmath111 is a constant .",
    "as far as dynamics is concerned , we must distinguish the cases in which the apparent horizon is formed at finite laboratory time @xmath34 , and in an infinite time ( , for @xmath4 ) .",

    "( note that the critical value of the exponent , @xmath114 , is now _ not _ the same as for the critical black hole , @xmath115 . )",
    "the configurations we have analyzed until now are the simplest from a purely mathematical point of view . however , having in mind acoustic analogue geometries reproducible in a one - dimensional pipe in the laboratory , it is more sensible to consider double - sided configurations . by this",
    "we mean that , after passing ( or approaching ) the sonic / supersonic regime at @xmath22 , and traversing an interval of width @xmath116 , the fluid again goes back to a subsonic regime as @xmath117 .",

    "the asymptotic behaviour of the function @xmath43 at @xmath123 ensures that all the right - going rays start to the left of the right - moving kink ( , the one in the region @xmath23 ) , then catch up with it , and begin to propagate through the intermediate region at a velocity @xmath124 that depends only on @xmath13 .",
    "before they reach the point @xmath22 , such rays might be overtaken by the right - moving kink , but only to start the chase again .",
    "after several mutual overtakings ( if the function @xmath43 is sufficiently complicated ) , the rays will always make an ultimate overtaking of the right - moving kink , embarking upon a final encounter with the left - moving kink on the right ( , in the region @xmath21 ) .",
    "let us denote by @xmath125 the time of such a last crossing of the right - moving kink , so the corresponding event is @xmath126 .",

    "one need also consider subdominant terms in @xmath43 , so the results will depend on the details of formation . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the above results are pertinent to a purely mathematical model .",
    "their physical relevance has to be assessed with respect to their application to both experimental reproduction of the analogue hawking radiation , and to the lessons they can provide concerning the possible behavior of black hole formation and evaporation in semiclassical gravity .",
    "we now turn to separately consider these two issues .",
    "the study carried on in this paper has identified several velocity profiles that are potentially interesting for experiments . in particular",
    "the critical black hole models seem worth taking into consideration in connection with the realizability of a hawking - like flux in the laboratory . the creation of supersonic configurations in a laboratory is usually associated with the development of instabilities .",
    "there are many examples of the latter in the literature ; in reference  @xcite it was shown that in an analogue model based on ripplons on the interface between two different sliding superfluids ( for instance , @xmath211he - phase a and @xmath211he - phase b ) , the formation of an ergoregion would make the ripplons acquire an amplification factor that eventually would destroy the configuration .",
    "therefore , this analogue system , although very interesting in its own right , will prove to be useless in terms of detecting a hawking - like flux .",
    "however , by creating , instead of an ergoregion , a critical configuration one should be able , at least , to have a better control of the incipient instability , while at the same time producing a dynamically controllable hawking - like flux . nevertheless , the actual realization of a critical configuration could also appear as a problematic task for entirely different reasons .",
    "the corresponding velocity profiles are characterized by discontinuities in the derivatives , so one might wonder whether they would be amenable to experimental construction , given that the continuum model is only an approximation .",
    "let us therefore discuss in some detail the validity of the latter for realistic systems .",
    "the main difference between an ideal perfect fluid model and a realistic condensed matter analogue is due to the microscopic structure of the system considered . in particular , it is generic to have a length scale @xmath212 which characterizes the breakdown of the continuum model ( @xmath212 is of the order of the intermolecular distance for an ordinary fluid ; of the coherence length for a superfluid ; and of the healing length for a bose  einstein condensate ) . in general , the viability of the analogue model requires one to consider distances @xmath213 of order of at least a few @xmath212 , depending on the accuracy of the experiment performed . in particular ,",
    "wave propagation is well defined only for wavelengths larger than @xmath212 ( generally with an intermediate regime , for wavelengths between @xmath212 and @xmath213 , where the phenomena exhibit deviations with respect to the predictions based on the continuum model ) . in general , a mathematical description based on the continuum model contains details involving scales smaller than @xmath213 ( for example , in the velocity profile ) .",
    "these details should , however , be regarded as unphysical : they are present in the model , but do not correspond to properties of the real physical system . in particular",
    ", they can not be detected experimentally , because this would require using wavelengths smaller than @xmath213 , which do not behave according to the predictions of the model ( and for wavelengths smaller than @xmath212 do not even make physical sense ) .",
    "for the mathematical models considered in the present paper , all this implies that one will not be able to distinguish , on empirical grounds , between those cases for which the velocity profiles differ from each other only by small - scale details",
    ". in particular , double - sided configurations with @xmath150 should be equivalent to configurations with a small , but non - zero , thickness @xmath214 .",
    "also , one would not be able to distinguish between two velocity profiles that differ only in a neighborhood @xmath213 of @xmath22 , one of which corresponds to a critical black hole , while the other describes an extremal one . in particular hawking radiation",
    "will not distinguish between the models within each of these pairs .",
    "this fact would not be troublesome , had our analysis led to identical results for the acoustic black holes of each pair .",
    "however , this is not the case ( see table  [ table ] ) .",
    "but then what shall we see if we realize these models in a laboratory ?",
    "in realistic situations , what is relevant for hawking radiation is a coarse - grained profile obtained by averaging over a scale of order @xmath213 , thus neglecting the unphysical small scale details in @xmath16 .",
    "this implies that as far as double - sided critical black holes are concerned , the reliable results are those pertinent to the non - zero thickness case ( @xmath215 ) .",
    "similarly , since these extremal black holes are never exactly realizable in a laboratory ( as this would require tuning the velocity profile on arbitrary small scales ) , only the predictions based on the critical black hole mathematical model will survive in an experimental setting .",
    "indeed , the relevant surface gravity will be defined by averaging the slope of the velocity profile over scales which are of order of @xmath213",
    ". this averaged surface gravity will be non - zero for both the critical and the extremal black hole , but will be approximately equal to the surface gravity at the horizon of the critical black hole , while it will obviously not coincide with the one of the extremal ( which is zero ) .      in the body of the paper",
    "we have used a terminology particularly suitable to dealing with analogue models based on acoustics .",
    "let us now discuss the most relevant features of our findings using a language more natural to gr .",
    "when the geometry associated with the formation of a spherically symmetric black hole through classical gravitational collapse ( as , for example , in the oppenheimer - snyder model  @xcite ) is described in terms of painlev - gullstrand  @xcite coordinates ( whose counterpart , in the context of acoustic geometries , are the natural laboratory coordinates @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) , the apparent horizon forms in a finite amount of coordinate time . in this regard",
    ", the painlev - gullstrand time behaves similarly to the proper time measured by a freely - falling observer attached to the surface of the collapsing star .",
    "the non - extremal , non - critical @xmath1-dimensional model analysed in this paper , captures the main features of the formation of a ( non - extremal ) black hole .",
    "the dynamical collapse is represented by the function @xmath43 in our calculations . in the language of gr",
    ", we can think of @xmath43 as the radial distance between the surface of a collapsing star and its schwarzschild radius ; @xmath35 corresponds to the moment in which the surface of the star enters its schwarzschild radius , and this moment corresponds to a finite time ( which we took to be @xmath34 ) . for this model",
    "we recovered hawking s result that the formation of ( non - extremal ) black holes causes the quantum emission towards infinity of a stationary stream of radiation with a planckian spectrum , at temperature @xmath166 .",
    "the mechanism for particle creation is somewhat `` more than dynamical '' as the characteristics of the stationary stream of particles are `` universal '' and only depend on the properties of the geometry at the horizon , @xmath47 , and not on any detail of the dynamical collapse . indeed , for @xmath43 given by equation ( [ appxi - bh ] )",
    " apparent horizon formation in a finite amount of time  we have seen that asymptotic quasi - particle creation does not depend even on the coefficient @xmath38 .",
    "that is , particle production does not depend on the velocity with which the surface of the collapsing star enters its schwarzschild radius .",
    "this picture leans toward the ( quite standard ) view that hawking s process is not just dynamical , but relies on the actual existence of an apparent horizon and an `` ergoregion '' beyond it , able to absorb the negative energy pairs  @xcite .",
    "however , by analyzing alternative models , in this paper we have seen two unexpected things :    i ) : :    one can also produce a truly hawking flux with a temperature    @xmath166 through the formation in a finite amount    of time of either a single - sided critical black hole , or a    double - sided critical black hole of finite  thickness \" , or even one of    zero  thickness \" ( see figure  [ f : spike ] ) .",
    "this is an intriguing result ,    as in none of these cases there is an `` ergoregion '' beyond the    apparent horizon , and in the last case there is just a single sonic    point .",
    "( in the language of gr , this last configuration corresponds to    stopping the collapse of a star at the very moment in which its    surface reaches the schwarzschild radius . )",
    "ii ) : :    moreover , one can also produce a stationary and planckian emission of    quasi - particles by , instead of actually forming the apparent horizon ,    just approaching its formation asymptotically in time with sufficient    rapidity ( @xmath216 ) . in this case",
    "the temperature is not    @xmath166 but @xmath217 ,    with@xmath218and    ( at any finite time ) there is neither an apparent horizon nor an    ergoregion within the configuration .",
    "explanations of particle    production based on tunneling then seem not viable , and the phenomenon    is closer to being interpreted as dynamical in origin .",
    "if fact , these    configurations interpolate between situations in which the dynamics    appears more prominently  when    @xmath219 we have that the temperature    goes as @xmath220  and others in which the    characteristics of the approached configuration are the more relevant    and `` universality '' is recovered  when @xmath221 we have that the temperature goes as    @xmath166 , indistinguishable from hawking s result .    by looking at our simple critical model",
    ", we can say that , in geometrical ( kinematical ) terms , in order to obtain a steady and universal flux of particles from a collapsing ( spherically symmetric ) star there is no need for its surface to actually cross the schwarzschild radius ; it is sufficient that it tend towards it asymptotically ( in proper time ) , with sufficient rapidity .",
    "our critical configurations could prove to be relevant also in the overall picture of semiclassical collapse and evaporation of black hole - like objects .",
    "our results based on critical configurations suggest an alternative scenario to the standard paradigm . at this stage",
    "we are only able to present it in qualitative and somewhat speculative terms .",
    "being aware of the various assumptions that could ultimately prove to be untenable , we still think it is worth to present this possible alternative scenario .",
    "imagine a dynamically collapsing star .",
    "the collapse process starts to create particles dynamically before the surface of the star crosses its schwarzschild radius ( this particle creation is normally associated with a transient regime and has nothing to do with hawking s planckian radiation ) .",
    "the energy extracted from the star in this way will make ( due to energy conservation ) its total mass decrease , and so also its schwarzschild radius . by this argument alone",
    ", we can see that a process is established in which the surface of the star starts to closely chase its schwarzschild radius while both collapse towards zero ( this situation was already described by boulware in reference  @xcite ) .",
    "now , the question is : will the surface of the shrinking star capture its shrinking schwarzschild radius in a finite amount of proper time ?",
    "let us rephrase this question in the language of this paper .",
    "in an evaporating situation our function @xmath43 still represents the distance between the surface of the star and its schwarzschild radius .",
    "the standard answer to the previous question is that @xmath43 becomes zero in a finite amount of proper time . to our knowledge , this view ( while certainly plausible ) is not guaranteed by explicit systematic and compelling calculations but still relies on somewhat qualitative arguments .",
    "the standard reasoning can be presented as follows : for sufficiently massive collapsing objects , the classical behaviour of the geometry should dominate any quantum back - reaction at any and all stages of the collapse process , as hawking s temperature ( considered as an estimate of the strength of this back - reaction ) is very low ; quantum effects would be expected to become important only at the last stages of the evaporation process . however , in opposition to this standard view , stephens , t hooft , and whiting  @xcite have argued for the mutual incompatibility of the existence of external observers measuring a hawking flux and , at the same time , the existence of infalling observers describing magnitudes beyond the apparent horizon .",
    "the reason is that the operators describing any feature of the hawking flux do not commute ( and this non - commutation blows up at late times ) with the infalling components of the energy - momentum tensor operator at the horizon .",
    "therefore , if we accept this argument , the presence of a hawking flux at infinity would be incompatible with the actual formation of the trapping horizon , which would be destroyed by the back - reaction associated to hawking particles .",
    "this fact leads these authors ( seeking for self consistency ) , to look for the existence of a hawking flux ( or at least a flux looking very much like it ) in background geometries in which the collapse process of the star is halted , just before crossing the schwarzschild radius , producing a bounce .",
    "( in our language this could be represented by a function @xmath43 monotonically decreasing from @xmath222 to some @xmath223 , at which it reaches a very small positive value , and then monotonically increasing from @xmath223 to @xmath224 . ) in their analysis they found exactly that : an approximately planckian spectrum of particles present at infinity during a sufficiently long time interval .",
    "however , the modified behaviour that deviates the least from the classical collapse picture , and at the same time eliminates the trapping horizon , is that in which @xmath43 does not reach zero , but just `` asymptotically approaches zero '' at infinite proper time , and does that very quickly .",
    "this is represented in our critical configurations by the exponential behaviour @xmath225 with a very large @xmath46 .",
    "the interesting point is that the analysis in this paper suggests that with quasi - stationary configurations like this , one could expect quasi - stationary planckian radiation at a temperature very close to @xmath166 , just like in the hawking process .",
    "standard gr suggests that the surface gravity @xmath47 ( inversely proportional to the total mass of the star ) would increase with time through the back - reaction caused by the quantum dissipation .",
    "moreover , it is sensible to think that during the evaporation process @xmath46 would also depend on @xmath13 . as the evaporation temperature increases ( @xmath47 increases )",
    "the back - reaction would become more efficient and therefore we might expect that @xmath46 decreases .",
    "then , one could arrive at a situation as the one portrayed in figure  [ f : critical - collapse ] .",
    "the evolution of the evaporation temperature would interpolate between a starting temperature completely controlled by @xmath47 and a late time temperature completely controlled by @xmath46 , showing a possible semiclassical mechanism for regularizing the end point of the evaporation process .",
    "in this scenario the complete semiclassical geometry will have neither an apparent horizon nor an event horizon .",
    "in this circumstance there would be no trans - planckian problem , nor information loss associated with the collapse and evaporation of this black hole - like object .",
    "whether this scenario is viable or not will be the subject of future work .",
    "let us end by making a brief comment concerning modified dispersion relations .",
    "everything we said in this paper assumes strict adherence to lorentz symmetry .",
    "even if semiclassical gravity contained lorentz - violating traces in the form of modified dispersion relations at high energy , one would still expect that the resulting scenario for the collapse and evaporation of a black hole - like object would keep the quasi - stationary hawking - like flux of particles as a robust prediction  @xcite .",
    "however , the complete conceptual scenario could be very different . in the presence of dispersion at high energies ,",
    "the notion of horizon itself shows up only as a low - energy concept .",
    "for example , with superluminal modifications of the dispersion relations , high energy signals will be able to escape from the trapped region .",
    "the non - analytic behaviour of some sets of modes at the horizon become regularized . therefore , the stephenst hooft  whiting obstruction described above forbidding the formation of a ( now approximate ) trapping horizon need no longer apply . we expect that by analyzing different analogue models in which the lorentz violating terms appear at different energy scales one would be able to explore the transition between all these alternative paradigms .",

    "<S> it is sufficient to set up a dynamically changing flow _ either _ eventually generating an arbitrarily small sonic region @xmath0 , but without any ergoregion , _ or _ even just asymptotically , in laboratory time , approaching a sonic regime with sufficient rapidity . </S>",
