    "during the past decades several studies have revealed a connection between the mass of black holes hosted in galactic nuclei and the properties of their host galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the redshift evolution of the cosmic star formation rate ( sfr ) and smbh accretion rate density are very similar @xcite . this  co - evolution \" has led various authors to investigate a possible connection between the presence of active galactic nuclei ( agn , which traces the smbh growth ) and the star formation properties of galaxies .",
    "a correlation was indeed observed between star formation and nuclear activity in numerous works at high agn luminosities ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while at low agn luminosities this link is more debated , with @xcite reporting no significant difference in the sfr between active and inactive galaxies , while @xcite found a slight enhancement for agn - hosting galaxies .",
    "they also reported that the enhancement of star formation activity in agn with respect to the bulk of inactive galaxies disappeared if quiescent galaxies were discarded , i.e. agn are more likely hosted in star forming galaxies .",
    "the gas content is often regarded as a more fundamental property of galaxies , with respect to the sfr .",
    "the sfr is tightly related to the gas content through the schmidt - kennicutt relation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* sk relation hereafter ) .",
    "currently , one of the most favored scenarios is that the cosmic evolution of the star formation rate in galaxies is mostly a consequence , through the sk relation , of the more fundamental evolution of their ( molecular ) gas content ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    within the context of agns , gas is the fundamental ingredient both for nuclear activity and star formation .",
    "possible differences in terms of star formation properties between agns hosts and inactive galaxies could be due to more fundamental differences in terms of gas content , as recently argued by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is most important to obtain information on the gas content of agn host galaxies , possibly as a function of galaxy properties ( e.g. stellar mass ) and redshift .",
    "the molecular gas content can be inferred from the luminosity of the co millimeter transitions , by assuming a proper co - to - h@xmath2 conversion factor . however , co observations are very time consuming , and surveys of large samples are extremely difficult and time demanding .",
    "alternatively , the total ( molecular and atomic ) gas mass can be derived from the dust content , inferred from the fir - submm sed , by assuming a dust - to - gas ratio ( dgr ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the uncertainties on the dust - to - gas ratio and its dependence on metallicity are similar to those affecting the co - to - h@xmath2 conversion factor , making the two methods comparable in terms of accuracy , at least at metallicities 12+log(o / h)@xmath38.0 @xcite .    in this work",
    "we exploit the dust method for measuring the gas masses in agn host galaxies . in particular",
    ", gas masses are obtained from the dust mass derived from the fir sed of several hundred agn host galaxies at z@xmath01 , along with a control sample of normal galaxies selected in the same stellar mass and redshift ranges .",
    "the aim of this work is to investigate differences in terms of gas content between agn hosts and the bulk of the galaxy population ( i.e. star forming and quiescent galaxies ) , in bins of stellar mass and redshift , to avoid potential biases caused by the dependency of the gas content on these two quantities .",
    "we make use of a stacking procedure to increase the luminosity completeness of the studied samples (   [ stack ] ) .",
    "we selected a sample of agn at @xmath4 ( as well as normal galaxies for the control sample ) in the cosmos , goods - s and goods - n fields .",
    "the choice of these fields was driven by the wide multiwavelength coverage provided by a number of surveys , which is crucial to derive reliable properties ( redshift , stellar mass , star - formation rate and dust mass ) .",
    "we used the far - infrared ( fir ) data from the pacs evolutionary probe ( pep , @xcite ) and the herschel multi - tiered extra - galactic survey ( hermes , @xcite ) programs , which cover the three fields used in this work .",
    "the former was performed with the pacs camera ( 70 , 100 and @xmath5 ; @xcite ) while the latter with the spire camera ( 250 , 350 and @xmath6 ; @xcite ) , both on board of the herschel space observatory @xcite .",
    "herschel catalogues are based on prior information on mips @xmath7 positions and fluxes .",
    "the pep catalogue was described by @xcite and @xcite , while the hermes catalogue was presented by @xcite . since only the goods - s field",
    "was observed at 70 @xmath8 , following ( * ? ? ?",
    "* s13 hereafter ) , who reported that the exclusion of that band does not significantly affect the results , we will not use the 70 @xmath8 data , to use a consistent procedure among all the fields .    for the goods - s field we used the optical / near - ir photometric data from the goods - music catalogue @xcite and the x - ray counterpart information from the 4 ms _ chandra _ deep field south ( cdf - s ) main catalogue @xcite .",
    "in the goods - n field we collected the multiwavelength data from the pep team catalogue @xcite and the x - ray data from the 2 ms _ chandra _ deep field north catalogue @xcite .",
    "finally , in the cosmos field we used the @xcite and @xcite multiwavelength catalogues and the _ chandra _ @xcite and xmm @xcite cosmos optical identification catalogues , complemented by the photometric redshifts presented by @xcite .",
    "all the catalogues are supplemented with spectroscopic or photometric redshifts .",
    "photometric redshift for inactive galaxies in cosmos and goods - n lacking redshift information in the above - mentioned catalogues were computed by using the eazy code @xcite .",
    "we applied two selection criteria to the parent sample in the three fields : 1 ) signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) @xmath9 in the k - band ; 2 ) @xmath10 .",
    "the k - band selection ensures that we can derive reliable estimates for the stellar mass ( following @xcite ) , while the redshift cut ensures that the herschel bands are not probing rest - frame wavelengths that may be significantly affected by agn heating and reprocessing ( which may affect our estimation of the dust masses ) .",
    "indeed , @xcite have shown that out to z@xmath111 the pacs colors are consistent with those typical of star forming galaxies , while some agn contamination to the 100@xmath12 m may occur at higher redshift .",
    "once these selections are applied , we divided the resulting objects into agn and a galaxy samples . in cosmos , we considered an x - ray detected object to be an agn following its optical classification @xcite or best - fitting sed template @xcite or if its absorption - corrected luminosity in the rest - frame @xmath13 band , where available , is @xmath14 .",
    "this threshold is a compromise between the sample size and the contamination by purely powerful star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "the luminosities were collected from @xcite and @xcite , who performed a spectral analysis on a sample of bright sources in the _",
    "chandra_-cosmos @xcite and xmm - cosmos @xcite catalogues , respectively . intrinsic luminosities of all the xmm - cosmos selected sources were also derived by the xmm - cosmos team using the observed fluxes and hardness ratio hr ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in goods - s we assumed the @xcite classification and luminosity for the x - ray sources . in goods -",
    "n we used the x - ray detected agn sample of @xcite .",
    "the luminosities of the x - ray selected agn for which this information could be retrieved are in the range @xmath15 , and only @xmath16 per cent of them have @xmath17 . given the limiting fluxes of the x - ray samples , the most obscured agn can still remain undetected . in order to at least partially recover them , we applied the irac power - law selection by @xcite .",
    "the resulting agn sample consists in 801 objects , of which 631 x - ray selected ( in any x - ray band considered in the above - mentioned catalogues ; 486 in cosmos and 145 in goods - s+n ) and 255 irac selected ( 241 in cosmos and 14 in goods - s+n ) .",
    "eighty - five agn ( 78 in cosmos and 7 in goods - s+n ) are in common between the two selections .",
    "all the sources which do not satisfy any of the agn selection criterion in each field are automatically classified as inactive galaxies ( @xmath18 objects ) .",
    "in this section we describe how the physical parameters for our sample of agn and galaxies were derived . in order to avoid selection effects due to redshift , stellar mass and luminosity affecting the dust mass ( and hence the gas mass ) measurement and distribution",
    ", we adopted a stacking technique to derive the average fir fluxes in bins of stellar mass and redshift .",
    "this method ensures a high level of completeness , since only a small fraction of sources are individually detected by herschel , especially in the longest wavelength bands .",
    "stellar masses for agn - hosting galaxies in the sample were derived using the same method as in @xcite , where several consistency tests were also performed .",
    "the observed optical photometry was fitted with a combined library of stellar synthetic templates @xcite and pure agn emission templates affected by levels of absorption @xcite associated with different column densities @xmath19 .    in order to break the degeneracies between the different fit parameters ,",
    "the agn were classified into type i ( unabsorbed ) and type ii ( absorbed ) sources on the basis of optical spectroscopic classification ( where available ) , best - fitting spectral energy distribution ( sed ) template from @xcite and intrinsic absorption derived from x - ray data analysis @xcite .",
    "sources for which all these priors are lacking , as well as x - ray undetected agn ( i.e. spitzer selected agn ) were considered as compton - thin type ii agn . moreover , by averaging the two templates of moderate absorption , the four @xcite templates were reduced to three : unabsorbed ( @xmath20 ) , compton - thin absorbed ( @xmath21 ) and compton - thick absorbed ( @xmath22 ) . only the most suitable template , based on the above classification ,",
    "was fitted to each agn . in particular , the unabsorbed , absorbed compton thin and absorbed compton thick templates were used for 100 , 694 and 7 sources , respectively .",
    "the fit was performed through a @xmath23 minimization up to @xmath24 rest - frame , since the @xcite templates do not include emission from dust reprocessing , assuming an exponentially declining star - formation history and a salpeter imf for the stellar component .",
    "each flux was weighted by the inverse of the photometric error and the redshift of each object was fixed during the fit .",
    "the stellar mass was derived by the best - fitting stellar component alone .",
    "agn and galaxies are divided into 6 stellar mass bins ( from @xmath25 to 12 ) and 4 redshift bins .",
    "the number of agn and galaxies in each bin is reported in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "hereafter , the stellar mass corresponding to each bin is assumed to be the mean stellar mass of the objects in the bin , with uncertainty equal to one standard deviation ( typically @xmath26 dex for both agn and galaxies ) .",
    "we adopt the stacking procedure implemented by @xcite , where details on the stacking procedure are given ( see also @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . however , in contrast with santini et al . , we do not bin in star formation rate ( sfr ) , since our goal is to investigate if differences in terms of gas content between agns and normal galaxies may actually be at the origin of their claimed sfr differences , hence we do not want to include any _ a priori _ selection or binning on the sfr .",
    "details on the stacking procedure are given in @xcite .",
    "here we only briefly summarize the basic steps .",
    "for each herschel band we excluded areas on the map where the integration time is lower than half the maximum , to avoid regions of high noise level .",
    "then , for each @xmath27 bin containing at least 10 objects , we stack on the residual image ( in which all the 3@xmath1 detected objects were subtracted ) of each herschel band at the position of the undetected sources in the bin , weighting with the inverse of the square of the error map .",
    "fluxes on the stacked images were measured through a psf fitting ( for the pacs bands ) or from the value of the central pixel ( on the spire images ) .",
    "errors on the stacked fluxes were computed through a bootstrap procedure .",
    "finally , the average flux s in each herschel band is computed as :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the stacked flux of the @xmath30 undetected objects in the bin and @xmath31 is the flux of each of the @xmath32 detected objects at the @xmath33 confidence level .",
    "[ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     since gas accretion onto super massive black holes ( smbh ) is the process at the origin of nuclear activity , whatever the mechanisms that drives the gas into the central regions are , it is not surprising that agns are preferentially hosted by gas rich galaxies ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "indeed , the conditions for gas accretion are statistically easier to be fulfilled in presence of a larger gas content . beyond these simple statistical arguments",
    ", models have been proposed that ascribe agn secular fuelling to disk instabilities @xcite , which are stronger in gas rich disks .",
    "our results support this scenario .",
    "as discussed above , the gas content is also the fundamental ingredient driving star formation in galaxies , through the sk relation .",
    "several works have found a relation between strong nuclear activity and enhanced sfr with respect to inactive galaxies ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite found that the herschel detection fraction for agn is higher than for galaxies and concluded that agn are more likely to be hosted by star forming galaxies .    given the dependency of the sfr on the gas content and the result obtained by us , the enhanced star formation in agn galaxies appears to be primarily the result of a larger ( on average ) gas content , with respect to the bulk of the galaxy population ( star forming and quiescent ) at similar stellar masses , as already suggested by @xcite and @xcite . however , the differences in terms of sfr are less clear with respect to the differences found by us in terms of gas content , probably because of the additional spread introduced by the sk relation , and the contribution of triggering mechanisms ( e.g. galaxy interactions ) , which may affect the star formation efficiency per unit gas mass .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to further discuss the level and nature of enhanced sfr in agn hosts .",
    "the main important result of our work is that agn host galaxies are characterized by much larger amounts of gas , strongly suggesting that generally agn activity in galaxies is simply fostered by a larger content of gas , without invoking specific triggering mechanisms .",
    "bins.,width=302 ]     bins.,width=302 ]",
    "making use of the wide multiwavelength data available in the cosmos , goods - s and goods - n fields , we selected a sample of agn and galaxies at @xmath34 .",
    "a stacking procedure on the herschel maps was implemented to derive the average herschel fluxes in bins of stellar mass and redshift .",
    "the stacked fir fluxes were then used to derive the average dust mass and , under reasonable assumptions , the average gas mass of agn hosts and normal galaxies .",
    "finally we compared the average gas mass of agn hosts and inactive galaxies in the same @xmath35 bins .",
    "we find that , at a given stellar mass and redshift , agns are hosted in galaxies much more gas - rich than inactive ones .",
    "the difference is strongest at low stellar masses , @xmath36 , where the gas mass in agn hosts is on average ten times higher than in normal galaxies ( a result significant at @xmath37 ) .",
    "significantly higher gas masses , relative to the normal galaxy population , are however also observed in agn hosts with stellar masses higher than @xmath38 .",
    "taken altogether , in nearly all stellar mass and redshift bins agn host galaxies have higher gas content than normal galaxies ; in almost half of the sample the gas fraction of agn host galaxies is more than three times higher than in normal galaxies .",
    "our result strongly suggests that the likelihood of having an agn in a galaxy is primarily given by the amount of gas in the host galaxy , while dynamical triggering processes ( bars , galaxy mergers and interactions ) likely play a secondary role , at least in the luminosity range probed by us .",
    "this result can be interpreted in simple statistics terms that it is more likely that a gas cloud falls into the potential of the supermassive black hole if there are overall more gas clouds in the host galaxy .",
    "more elaborated models , in which secular fuelling of agns is caused by disk instabilities , which are stronger in more gas rich disks , are also supported by our results .",
