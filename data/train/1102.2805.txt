    "in recent years , two dimensional grid based statistical mechanical models have been the focus of much research .",
    "these discrete models often possess a _ critical point _ , where there is an abrupt change of behavior , called the _",
    "phase transition_. at this point , the models can exhibit macroscopic randomness .",
    "this leads to studying the _ scaling limit _ ,",
    "i.e. the behavior of the model when the lattice spacing tends to zero .    before taking the scaling limit , consider the _ off - critical model _ which is a perturbation from the critical point .",
    "these types of models , in general , do not feature any macroscopic randomness and taking the scaling limit of such a model gives a trivial measure .",
    "however , one could consider the behavior when the lattice size tends to zero while simultaneously moving the parameters towards the critical point .",
    "we call this limit a _ scaling window_. by choosing an appropriate re - scaling , we often find non - trivial scaling window measures for off - critical statistical mechanical models . studying these measures",
    "sometimes provides additional information about the critical point behavior .    in this paper , we focus on the dimer model ( for the original paper , see @xcite ) on a bipartite planar graph , which is a particular two dimensional statistical mechanical model , defined as follows for a finite graph . call a _ dimer configuration _ to be a subset of edges in which each vertex is incident to one edge .",
    "the _ dimer model _ is a probability measure on the set of all dimer configurations of the underlying graph .",
    "weights can be applied to the edges so that the probability of a configuration is proportional to the product of the edge weights",
    ".      let @xmath0 be an infinite planar bipartite graph .",
    "as @xmath0 is bipartite , we can define a _ height function _ which is in one - to - one correspondence ( up to height level ) with each dimer configuration ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this gives the viewpoint that the dimer model is the graph of a random function from @xmath1 , i.e. a random surface ( see @xcite for more details of random surfaces ) .",
    "a precise definition of the _ height function _ for the dimer model can be found in @xcite .",
    "informally , the height function can be defined as follows .",
    "suppose @xmath2 is the number of edges incident to each vertex and that @xmath2 is fixed for @xmath0 .",
    "the height function is a continuous function from @xmath3 to @xmath4 which is integer valued at the center of each face of @xmath0 .",
    "the height change between the centers of two faces sharing an edge is @xmath5 if there is a dimer covering the shared edge or @xmath6 if there is no dimer covering that shared edge .",
    "we choose the following sign convention : suppose that the black vertex is to the left when traversing the shared edge between two faces .",
    "the height change along the traversal is @xmath7 if there is a dimer covering the shared edge and -1 otherwise . with this setup",
    ", it can easily be seen that the total height change at the centers of the faces surrounding each vertex is zero .",
    "define the toroidal graph @xmath8 to be the quotient of @xmath9 , that is , the action of @xmath10 on @xmath0 by horizontal and vertical translations .",
    "let @xmath11 denote the set of all dimer coverings on @xmath8 .",
    "define a probability measure @xmath12 for @xmath13 so that the probability of observing @xmath14 is proportional to the product of all the edge weights . for dimer models on periodic graphs ,",
    "there is a limiting measure @xmath15 when the system size is sent to infinity .",
    "this limiting measure is a _ gibbs _",
    "measure and is called the _ thermodynamic limit_.    as mentioned above , the scaling window represents the limiting measure ( of an observable ) when the lattice spacing tends to zero while simultaneously moving the parameters to the critical point .",
    "we use the following notation for scaling windows : for an order @xmath16 perturbation from criticality , the _ scaling window _",
    "@xmath17 of a measure is the limiting measure when re - scaling the horizontal axis by @xmath18 , the vertical axis by @xmath19 and @xmath20 for @xmath21 . in other words , a box consisting of @xmath22 lattice points",
    "is sent to a box with continuum area 1 under the scaling window @xmath17 . in the literature",
    ", scaling windows have appeared in different guises such as _ critical windows _ or _",
    "intermediate phases_. in section [ sec : intro : related ] , we briefly survey some of these results for other two dimensional discrete models and provide some motivating remarks .",
    "this paper considers two differently weighted dimer models of the square grid .",
    "we say that the dimer model is _ flipped _ if the edge weights alternate between @xmath23 and @xmath24 along a vertical line and between @xmath25 and @xmath26 along a horizontal line .",
    "let @xmath27 denote the flipped dimer model with edge weights @xmath28 and @xmath26 .",

    "the random spanning tree can be constructed using wilson s algorithm @xcite with random walk probabilities @xmath38 for the north , east , south and west steps .",
    "the flipped dimer model also defines a spanning tree ( and dual tree ) with the root at infinity but this tree can not be constructed using wilson s algorithm with a massive random walk .",
    "it follows from theorem [ intro : thm : equivmeas ] that these two trees are equal in distribution .",
    "it is not known whether there is combinatorial construction which gives a bijection between these two trees .",
    "the dimer model @xmath39 ( or @xmath40 ) is a critical statistical model @xcite .",

    "we find that    [ intro : thm : non - gauss ]    in the thermodynamic limit , the height fluctuations for the flipped dimer model @xmath41 in the scaling window @xmath42 are non - gaussian .",
    "the proof of non - gaussian fluctuations is based on showing that the fourth moments of the height function can not be written as the sum of a product of paired moments , i.e. does not satisfy wick s theorem .",
    "note that in the limit as @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the fluctuations are gaussian and are given by the gaussian free field @xcite .",
    "if @xmath43 and @xmath45 , the fluctuations are given by white noise .",
    "the probability distribution of the fluctuations of the height function of @xmath46 under the scaling window @xmath42 remains an open problem .",
    "we provide some of the ( recent ) results that are closely connected with scaling limits and windows of the dimer model and random directed spanning trees .",
    "richard kenyon , in @xcite and @xcite , showed that the scaling limit of the height fluctuations of the critical dimer model on the square grid is conformally invariant and is given by a gaussian free field ( see @xcite for more details on the gff ) .",
    "this is the same measure if we take the scaling window @xmath42 followed by the limit @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",
    "recently , there have been many different results such as @xcite proving that the contours of the discrete gaussian free field converge to sle(4 ) ( schramm loewner evolution ) in the scaling limit .",
    "sle(4 ) is also the conjectured distribution of paths formed from the scaling limit of the critical double dimer model .",
    "excellent surveys of sle can be be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the uniform spanning tree has been of considerable interest and many results can be found in @xcite .",
    "the kpw - temperely bijection @xcite shows that the uniform spanning tree is in bijection with the critical dimer model .",
    "this bijection allows some further computations , which are accessible using the dimer model technology .",
    "indeed , @xcite provided the first rigorous computational evidence that the uniform spanning tree has some conformal structure .",
    "it has been shown that the scaling limit of the peano curve of the 2d uniform spanning tree is sle(8 ) ( @xcite ) .    scaling windows of other discrete models",
    "have also been considered . in the literature ,",
    "these have often been called near - critical or intermediate phase .",
    "for 2d site percolation on a triangular lattice , @xcite classified the different scaling windows while @xcite shows that there are an infinite number of small loops for near - critical percolation under a certain choice of scaling window .",
    "there exists scaling windows of models whose scaling limits give sle .",
    "these objects are called massive sle @xcite .",
    "they can be constructed by perturbing the fugacity and performing the scaling window with respect to the fugacity .",
    "for example , the off - critical lerw features loops with a small weight and the lattice is then re - scaled while simultaneously sending the small weight to zero ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is not known whether the scaling windows of the dimer models studied in this paper are connected with massive sle .",
    "non - gaussian fluctuations are not uncommon for 2d statistical mechanical models perturbed from criticality .",
    "for example , the so - called 2d @xmath49-model has non - gaussian fluctuations in the scaling limit @xcite .    the motivation behind theorem [ intro : thm : non - gauss ] was to find properties of the height fluctuations between the scaling limit of the critical and off - critical dimer model on the square grid .",
    "in order to determine whether the off - critical model under re - scaling provided some non - trivial behavior , we needed to send the parameters of the model to the critical point while simultaneously sending the mesh size to zero which is defined as the scaling window in section [ sec : intro : briefsetup ] . the choice of the scaling window parameter exponents @xmath50 and @xmath51 are chosen so that the correlation length of height function is finite under re - scaling .",
    "other symmetric choices of the scaling window parameter exponents leads to the fluctuations governed by either the gaussian free field or white noise depending on whether the re - scaling is too slow or too fast .",
    "finally , many physical models are studied away from the critical point using perturbation theory with the goal that they belong to some universality class . for an example related to the dimer model on the square grid",
    ", @xcite considers the six - vertex model close to the critical point and shows the scaling under a certain limit is the same as the critical sine - gordon model @xcite .",
    "we believe that the model studied in this paper belongs to the universality class of free field theory deformed by a certain operator but the exact details of this remains open .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : setup ] , we provide some background information about the dimer model , such as , the kasteleyn method .",
    "the proof of theorem [ intro : thm : equivmeas ] , the bijections of the discrete models as well as the operators for the underlying random walks are given in section [ sec : discrete ] . in section [ sec : scalingwindow ] , we compute the relevant green s functions for the operators , which allow us to prove theorem [ intro : thm : non - gauss ] . in the same section",
    ", we also provide the amoeba interpretation of the scaling window .",
    "we refer to the graph @xmath52 as the fundamental domain .",
    "orient the edges of @xmath52 so that the number of counter clockwise edges per face is odd .",
