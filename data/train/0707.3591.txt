    "<S> these problems would not occur if @xmath13 were the first radial scalar excitation of the proton . </S>",
    "<S> the roper resonance can then be interpreted within a coupled - channel meson exchange model based on an effective chiral - symmetric lagrangian @xcite ; no genuine @xmath14 ( 3 quark ) resonance was needed to fit @xmath15 phase shifts and inelasticities , in agreement with @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath17 , a baryon with positive strangeness , which may have been observed in low - statistics photo - production experiments @xcite , made the roper resonance @xcite and/or the @xmath13 @xcite to viable pentaquark candidates . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a very narrow @xmath0 state in the mass region 1650 - 1750 mev was investigated in  @xcite . the fading evidence for @xmath17 @xcite makes this interpretation less attractive . morsch and zupranski @xcite suggested the roper mass region might house two resonances , one at 1390mev with a small elastic width and large coupling to @xmath18 , and a second one at higher mass  around 1460mev  with a large elastic width and small @xmath18 coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the former resonance was found to be produced in @xmath15 scattering , and in @xmath19-proton scattering using an @xmath19 beam of @xmath20gev kinetic energy ; the latter resonance was suggested to be excited by @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the two resonances may have rather different wave functions @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the discrepancies show the difficulties of extracting total cross sections when the full phase space is not covered by the detector . </S>",
    "<S> note that the extrapolation was done differently : the cb - elsa and the a2-taps collaborations used the result of this partial wave analysis ; the graal collaboration used a simulation based on @xmath40 and @xmath41 phase space . the inclusion of both , cb - elsa and taps data , provides an additional tool to estimate the systematic error of the experimental data . the fit curves in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> its decay fraction into @xmath23 ( @xmath44 ) is not in conflict with the pdg mean value ( 20 - 30% ) ; only the @xmath3 partial decay width deviates significantly from pdg . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath45 while pdg gives 5 - 10% .    </S>",
    "<S> due to its larger phase space , decays into @xmath46 are more frequent than those into @xmath3 even though the latter decay mode provides the largest coupling . for a radial excitation , </S>",
    "<S> this is not unexpected : about 50% of all @xmath47 resonances decay into j/@xmath48 , more than 25% of @xmath49 resonances decay via @xmath50 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the large value of @xmath51 might therefore support the interpretation of the roper resonance as radial excitation .    </S>",
    "<S> an alternative interpretation of the @xmath18 decay is offered by hernandez , oset and vicente - vacas @xcite who take into account the re - scattering of the two final state pions . </S>",
    "<S> the authors of @xcite do not fit data ; instead they show that they can reproduce qualitatively the phenomenology of @xmath52 decays by rescattering thus avoiding the need to introduce a genuine @xmath53 amplitude .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we have presented new data on photoproduction of two neutral pions in the energy range from the 2@xmath31 production threshold up to a photon energy of 820mev ( mainz ) and up to 1300mev ( bonn ) and reported results from a partial wave analysis of this and of related reactions .    </S>",
    "<S> the focus of this letter is the roper resonance . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the data are incompatible with the conjecture that conflicting results on its properties could originate from the presence of two similar resonances and their interference , where both are in the @xmath0 wave and both fall into the 1300 to 1500mev mass region . due to the fact that the roper properties are over - constrained by the data , we can rule out this possibility . </S>",
    "<S> the decay pattern is consistent with an interpretation of the roper resonance as first radial excitation of the nucleon . </S>"
