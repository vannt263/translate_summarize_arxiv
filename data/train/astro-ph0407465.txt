    "understanding the metal enrichment history of the universe , in environments ranging from the low - density intergalactic medium to the highest overdensity regions in galaxies and galaxy clusters , has emerged as one of the pressing challenges of current cosmology and galaxy evolution studies .",
    "measurements of abundances in qso absorption line systems have shown remarkably little evolution of metallicity from @xmath0  @xmath10 4 down to @xmath0  @xmath11 1 . moreover ,",
    "this lack of evolution is evident in all absorber samples regardless of column density , ranging from the low - density ly@xmath1  clouds with @xmath12 ( ) @xmath13 @xmath14 ( e.g. , songaila 2001 ; pettini et al .",
    "2003 ; schaye et al .",
    "2003 ; simcoe , sargent , & rauch 2004 ) up to the highest - column density damped ly@xmath1  absorbers with @xmath12 ( ) @xmath15 @xmath14 ( e.g. , pettini et al .",
    "1999 ; prochaska & wolfe 2002 ) ; these absorbers span several orders of magnitude in overdensity @xmath16 .",
    "it does appear that at any particular redshift , the lower-@xmath12()/lower@xmath17 absorbers generally have lower overall metallicities , but it should be noted that as @xmath12 ( ) decreases , the abundance measurements become increasingly sensitive to ionization corrections ( see , e.g. , figure 13 in schaye et al .",
    "there are also indications that absorber metallicities are highly inhomogeneous ( schaye et al .",
    "2003 ) , and it remains possible that some absorption systems are metal - free ( e.g. , levshakov et al . 2003 ; simcoe et al . 2004",
    "; aracil et al .",
    "2004 ) .    for the damped ly@xmath1  absorbers ( dlas ) in particular ,",
    "the observation of weak evolution with redshift is intriguing .",
    "after all , the milky way is a damped ly@xmath1  absorber , and its ism metallicity ( in the vicinity of the sun ) is substantially higher than the dla metallicity trend extrapolated to @xmath18 0 . if the dlas arise in the bound interstellar media of objects that are the precursors of today s spiral galaxies , which has long been the canonical view ( e.g. , wolfe et al .",
    "1986 ) , then why are the abundances not increasing at a rate sufficient to reach solar metallicity at @xmath19 0 ? recently , prochaska et al . ( 2003 ) have presented evidence of slowly increasing metallicity with decreasing @xmath20 based on a sample of 125 dlas , but they note that the extrapolation to @xmath20 = 0 still falls @xmath21 below the milky way metallicity .",
    "we note , though , that the evolution of dla metallicity with redshift still suffers from considerable uncertainty due to the limited number of robust abundance measurements in low@xmath9 dlas ( see below ) .",
    "theoretical studies employing hydrodynamic simulations have reproduced the slow evolution of the dlas but generally predict substantially higher mean metallicities than observed ( cen et al .",
    "2003 ; nagamine , springel , & hernquist 2004 ) , a discrepancy that is attributed to either a bias in the observations due to obscured qsos ( but see counterarguments in ellison et al . 2001",
    "; prochaska 2003 ) or inadequate treatment of supernova feedback and the multiphase nature of the gas .    however , all current observational studies are dominated by absorbers with @xmath0  @xmath22 2 .",
    "the lookback time increases quickly with redshift , and the current samples only probe the first @xmath2320% of the history of the universe . indeed , if the dla metallicities reported by prochaska et al . ( 2003 ) are expressed as a function of cosmic time instead of redshift",
    ", then these latest data indicate that dla metallicites appear to be doubling every billion years at @xmath24 . without the lowest - redshift bin , extrapolation of this trend vs. time to the current epoch would predict highly super - solar abundances in dlas at @xmath19 0 .",
    "clearly , the lowest - redshift dlas now present the key to understanding dla metallicity evolution , and it is crucial to examine how the absorption systems evolve in the relatively unstudied 80% of the age of the universe between @xmath25 2 and now .",
    "for the most part , this requires observations from space ( the optimal absorption lines for abundance measurements are in the uv at these redshifts ) , a task which presents several challenges .",
    "low - redshift high-@xmath12 ( ) absorption systems are rarely found in traditionally constructed unbiased surveys ; e.g. , jannuzi et al . ( 1998 ) found only one dla in a survey of 83 qsos with the _ hst _ faint object spectrograph .",
    "rao & turnshek ( 2000 ) have demonstrated that the low@xmath9 dla sample can be increased more rapidly by selecting targets known to show the @xmath262796.35 , 2803.53 doublet a priori , but even dlas found in this way are slowly yielding metallicities , partly because the background qsos are still too faint for follow - up high - resolution spectroscopy with current space - borne instrumentation .",
    "the lowest - redshift dlas are especially interesting because these absorbers provide the greatest opportunity to understand the nature of the dla progenitor .",
    "for example , we have found a dla that originates in a low - surface brightness galaxy at @xmath20 = 0.009 ( bowen et al .",
    "2001a , b ) ; this galaxy would be challenging to detect at even moderate redshifts .",
    "for these reasons , we are pleased to report in this paper the serendipitous discovery of a new damped ly@xmath1  system at @xmath0  = 0.00632 in the direction of pg1216 + 069 . using the e140 m echelle mode of the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on board _ hst",
    "_ , we have been conducting a large survey for low@xmath9 absorption lines , which appear to harbor a significant fraction of the baryons at the present epoch ( tripp et al . 2000a , b ; savage et al .",
    "2002 ; richter et al . 2004",
    "; sembach et al .",
    "the sight line to one of the qsos observed under the auspices of this survey , pg1216 + 069 , passes through a very interesting region of the nearby universe .",
    "as shown in figure  [ xraymap ] , this sight line pierces the southwest periphery of the virgo galaxy cluster .",
    "the pg1216 + 069 sight line is outside of the 6@xmath27 cluster core defined by tully & shaya ( 1984 ) , but it is within the sphere of influence of the cluster according to those authors .",
    "an even more intriguing aspect of this sight line is that it is @xmath23400 kpc in projection from the center of the ngc4261 galaxy group .",
    "this group , which is at a redshift close to ( but slightly higher than ) the redshift of the virgo cluster proper , is known to have a hot intragroup medium from _ rosat _ detection of diffuse x - ray emission ( davis et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "while observations of pg1216 + 069 made with the first - generation _ hst _ spectrographs had revealed a strong ly@xmath1  line at @xmath0  @xmath11 0.006 , i.e. , near the redshift of the virgo cluster ( bowen et al .",
    "1996 ; impey , petry , & flint 1999 ) , the low spectral resolution of the early _ hst _ spectra precluded recognition of the damped nature of this absorption system .",
    "a portion of the new stis spectrum of this qso covering the ly@xmath1  line in virgo is shown in figure  [ dlaspec ] .",
    "this ly@xmath1  line has well - developed damping wings . technically , even though the damping wings are quite obvious , the column density of the @xmath0  = 0.00632 system is too low to qualify as a `` damped '' ly@xmath1  absorber according to the standard definition , which requires log @xmath12 ( ) @xmath28 20.3 .",
    "hence , we will refer to this system as a `` sub - dla '' .",
    "originally , the standard dla definition was mainly an observational convenience for early low - resolution spectroscopic studies .",
    "in many respects , sub - dlas can have physical characteristics that are similar to the higher @xmath12 ( ) dlas .",
    "however , ionization corrections can be more important in sub - dlas ( e.g. , dessauges - zavadsky et al . 2003 ; proux et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "in this paper we present the remarkable properties of this new , nearby sub - dla in the immediate vicinity of the virgo cluster .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : after presenting the observations and absorption line measurements in   [ obsec ] and   [ abmeas ] , respectively , we derive the absolute and relative metal abundances of the absorber in   [ abund ] , including analyses of potentially important sources of systematic errors such as unresolved line saturation and ionization corrections . in   [ physcon ] , we briefly discuss the physical conditions in the absorbing gas .",
    "we then provide information on the environment in which the system is found (   [ abenv ] ) and limits on absorption associated with the ngc4261 group (   [ whimsec ] ) before offering some comments on the nature and implications of the absorber properies in ",
    "[ disec ] .",
    "we close with a summary of the main results in   [ sumsec ] , and the appendix briefly discusses stis wavelength calibration errors .",
    "pg1216 + 069 was observed with the e140 m spectroscopic mode of stis on 7 occasions in 2003 may - june ; the total integration time was 69.8 ksec .",
    "this echelle spectrograph provides a resolution of 7 km s@xmath29  ( fwhm ) with @xmath232 pixels per resolution element and covers the @xmath30   range with only a few small gaps between orders at @xmath31   ( woodgate et al .",
    "1998 ; kimble et al . 1998 ) . the observations",
    "employed the @xmath32 slit in order to minimize the wings in the line - spread function ( see figure 13.91 in the stis instrument handbook , kim quijano et al .",
    "the data were reduced as described in tripp et al .",
    "( 2001 ) using the stis team version of calstis at the goddard space flight center .",
    "we encountered three minor calibration issues when we reduced these data .",
    "first , there are a significant number of warm / hot pixels on the detector .",
    "some of these were successfully fixed with an automatic identification and interpolation algorithm using pixels adjacent to the hot pixels , but many of the warm pixels are not easily identified and corrected in the individual exposures due to low count rates , and these remained in the data after the hot - pixel cleaning procedure . when the individual exposures were combined into a single final spectrum ,",
    "these pixels became more evident .",
    "fortunately , there is no clear evidence that the important absorption lines discussed in this paper are significantly affected by warm / hot pixels .",
    "second , after flux calibration , overlapping regions of adjacent orders showed slight flux discrepancies , mainly very close to order edges .",
    "we used the recently improved ripple correction ( as of 2003 july ) , but nevertheless these small discrepanices are likely due to residual imperfections in the ripple correction . to avoid spurious features at order edges , when we coadded the overlapping regions of adjacent orders , we smoothly decreased the weight given to the 50 pixels approaching the order edges with the last 10 pixels thrown out all together .",
    "third , we noticed and corrected small errors ( @xmath33 pixel ) in the relative wavelength calibration .",
    "these wavelength calibration errors are larger than expected , and indeed are larger than we have seen in many other observations with this mode of stis , so we have summarized the evidence of this problem in the appendix .",
    "nevertheless , compared to archival spectra available from other uv instruments / facilities , the stis relative wavelength calibration is still excellent , and moreover these small shifts would have very little effect on our measurements and science conclusions even if they were neglected .",
    "pg1216 + 069 was also observed with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ in a single visit on 2001 february 6 for 12.4 ksec ( dataset root p10721 ) .",
    "this is a short exposure compared to typical _ fuse _ observations of extragalactic objects , and indeed the final _ fuse _ spectrum of pg1216 + 069 is relatively noisy .",
    "nevertheless , we shall see that by virtue of its unique wavelength coverage , this _ fuse _ spectrum provides useful constraints for our analysis of the virgo sub - dla . to reduce the _ fuse _",
    "data , we first calibrated the raw time - tagged data frames using the calfuse pipeline reduction ( version 2.4.0 ) .",
    "the calibrated datasets comprised six individual sub - exposures for each _ fuse _ channel .",
    "the signal - to - noise of each subexposure was too low to permit us to derive any shifts between sub - exposures , so we simply summed the total number of counts in each pixel from all six sub - exposures .",
    "however , our experience with _ fuse _ observations of substantially brighter targets indicates that shifts between sub - exposures are small or negligible in a single visit , so our procedure for coaddition of the pg1216 + 069 data should result in little or no degradation of spectral resolution .",
    "we binned the final coadded _ fuse _ spectrum to @xmath34 km s@xmath29  pixels , which provides @xmath232 pixels per resolution element . only the lif channels",
    "contained enough signal to be useful , so the effective wavelength coverage of the _ fuse _ spectrum is 1000 - 1185  .",
    "the usual strong ism lines ( e.g. , @xmath351020.70 , @xmath361031.93,1037.62 , @xmath351036.34 , @xmath351144.94 ) are readily apparent in the final _ fuse _ spectrum along with several extragalactic absorption lines . in this paper",
    ", we will make use of the _ fuse _ data for two purposes .",
    "first , we will use the lif2a segment to search for @xmath351083.99 absorption at the redshift of the virgo sub - dla .",
    "second , we will use the lif1a and lif2b segments to place constraints on associated with the ngc4261 group and the sub - dla . to calibrate the zero point of the lif2a wavelength scale , we aligned the @xmath351144.94 absorption profile with the profile of the @xmath351608.45 line in the stis spectrum . for the lif1a and lif2b spectra , we compared the @xmath351036.34 and @xmath351334.53 lines from the _ fuse _ and stis spectra , respectively . these and transitions have similar strengths , and this procedure results in a zero - point velocity uncertainty of 5@xmath3710 km s@xmath29 . due to the low s",
    "/ n ratios of the individual spectra , we aligned and coadded the lif1a and lif2b segments for the measurements .",
    "this may degrade the spectral resolution , but examination of the coadded spectrum indicates that the degradation is minimal . in the case of the line , only the lif2a spectrum had the right wavelength coverage and sufficient s / n to place useful constraints .",
    "a selected portion of the final , coadded stis spectrum is shown in figure  [ dlaspec ] .",
    "the strong ly@xmath1  absorption line at @xmath0  = 0.00632 is readily apparent along with adjacent lines from various redshifts including the damped ly@xmath1  line due to galactic , ly@xmath38 at @xmath0  = 0.28228 , and ly@xmath1  at @xmath0  = 0.00375 .",
    "the ly@xmath38 line is recorded at low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) due to its location in the pit of the milky way ly@xmath1  absorption .",
    "nevertheless , the ly@xmath38 identification is secure because @xmath1011 other lyman series lines are detected at @xmath0  = 0.28228 . only ly@xmath1  is detected at @xmath0  = 0.00375 .",
    "we note that ly@xmath1  absorbers are frequently detected at 0.003 @xmath39 @xmath0  @xmath39 0.008 in the spectra of qsos in the general direction of the virgo cluster ( e.g. , bowen et al . 1996 ; impey , petry , & flint 1999 ; tripp et al . 2002",
    "; rosenberg et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the well - developed lorentzian wings of the ly@xmath1  line at @xmath0  = 0.00632 tightly constrain the column density .",
    "since the @xmath0  = 0.00632 ly@xmath1  line is positioned in the red wing of the milky way damped ly@xmath1  profile ( see figure  [ dlaspec ] ) , we fitted the milky way line as well as the @xmath0  = 0.00632 absorber .",

    "the column derived from the milky way ly@xmath1  profile is in good agreement with the @xmath12 ( ) reported by lockman & savage ( 1995 ) based on 21 cm emission in the direction of pg1216 + 069 .",

    ", , and are not apparent at the 3@xmath41 significance level .",
    "the strong @xmath351206.50 line is redshifted into the core of the galactic ly@xmath1  line and consequently can not be reliably measured .",
    "selected absorption - line profiles of detected species are shown in figure  [ normprofs ] ; non - detections are plotted in figure  [ nocum ] .",
    "we have measured the rest - frame equivalent widths using the techniques of sembach & savage ( 1992 ) , which include continuum placement uncertainty as well as a 2% uncertainty in the stis flux zero level .",
    "these equivalent widths are listed in table  [ intprop ] along with upper limits on undetected species of interest .",
    "we have used two techniques to estimate the column densities of metals in the sub - dla .",
    "first , we used standard voigt - profile fitting with the program of fitzpatrick & spitzer ( 1997 ) and the line - spread functions from the stis handbook ( kim quijano et al .",
    "2003 ) . inspection of the absorption profiles ( see figure  [ normprofs ] ) reveals two well - detected components at @xmath42 0 and 28 km s@xmath29  in the absorber velocity frame .",
    "the strongest lines show marginal evidence of additional , barely detectable components at @xmath43 km s@xmath29 .",
    "these possible components are too poorly defined to justify any attempts to fit them with voigt profiles .",
    "thus , we have elected to only fit the two well - detected components ; we discuss below how inclusion of the additional weak features at @xmath44 0 km s@xmath29could affect our conclusions . results from voigt - profile fitting are summarized in table  [ voigtfit ] including the velocity centroid , @xmath45value , and column density for the two primary components .    for our second approach ,",
    "we use the more generalized technique of directly integrating the `` apparent column density '' profiles ( see savage & sembach 1991 ; jenkins 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "this method does not incorporate any assumption that the velocity profile is inherently gaussian . instead , each pixel is used to calculate the apparent optical depth as a function of velocity , @xmath46 $ ] , where @xmath47 is the observed intensity and @xmath48 is the estimated continuum intensity at velocity @xmath49 . in turn",
    ", @xmath50 is used to calculate the apparent column density , @xmath51 .",
    "if the profiles do not contain narrow , saturated structures that are degraded by instrumental smoothing , then @xmath52  can be directly integrated to obtain a good measurement of the total column density , @xmath53 . as in the equivalent width measurements , we used the methods of sembach & savage ( 1992 ) to incorporate the uncertainties due to continuum placement and the flux zero point in the overall @xmath52  error bars .",
    "the column densities from direct integration of @xmath52  profiles are given in table  [ intprop ] .",
    "we list both the _ total _ column densities ( integrated across both components ) and the integrated columns for the strongest component ( at @xmath54 km s@xmath29 ) only .",
    "we will make use of the measurements for the strongest component only when we examine relative abundances in   [ relmet ] .",
    "it is important to note that several of the metal lines are strong and narrow ( see figure  [ normprofs ] ) , and we should be concerned about whether unresolved saturation could cause the column densities to be underestimated .",
    "voigt profile fitting can adequately correct for unresolved saturation to some extent by adjusting the line width , but it has been shown that when lines are significantly affected by unresolved saturation , profile fitting can produce erroneous results ( e.g. , shull et al . 2000 ; sembach et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the apparent column density technique can also be used to check ( and correct ) for unresolved saturation given two or more transitions of a particular ion with significantly differing @xmath55 values .",
    "if the lines are not affected by saturation , then the @xmath52  profiles of weaker and stronger transitions will agree .",
    "conversely , if the profiles are affected by saturated components , then weaker transitions will yield significantly higher apparent column densities than corresponding stronger transitions .    to check for saturation in the metal lines of the sub - dla of this paper , we made use of the fact that exhibits a generous array of transitions within our spectral coverage .",
    "we detected the @xmath36 1190.42 , 1260.42 , 1304.37 , and 1526.71 transitions ( the 1193.29   line could not be used due to strong blending with galactic absorption ) ; the weakest and strongest lines in this set differ by a factor of 12 in @xmath55 ( see table  [ intprop ] ) . when we compared the apparent optical depths of the different lines , it was clear that they did not scale in proportion to the values of @xmath55 , indicating the presence of unresolved saturation .",
    "a method to correct @xmath52  profiles for unresolved saturation has been outlined by jenkins ( 1996 ) .",
    "the discussion in jenkins ( 1996 ) applies to the analysis of doublets , but the arguments can be generalized to include simultaneously many lines of differing strength .",
    "we have applied this method to the sub - dla lines in order to correct for the unresolved saturation . at each velocity , we solved for the minimum values of the @xmath56 in all of the recorded intensities by allowing two parameters to vary : the true column density per unit velocity @xmath57 and a saturation parameter , one that is directly analogous to the @xmath45value in a classical application of a curve of growth to measurements of equivalent widths .",
    "much of the detail in the final outcome is governed by the strongest line , since it has the greatest sensitivity to small changes in @xmath57",
    ". nevertheless , the weaker lines are able to influence the shape of the profile where the stronger lines are affected by saturation , creating an outcome that corrects for the distortion caused by unresolved , saturated structures .",
    "this method also automatically gives the greatest weight to the most useful transition for each velocity element .",
    "that is , moderate optical depths prevail over the weak ones buried in the noise or the very strong ones that are more subject to systematic errors .",
    "the saturation - corrected , composite profile is compared to the @xmath351302.17 and @xmath351334.53 profiles in figure  [ navplot ] .",
    "the correction implied by the @xmath52  profiles turned out to be relatively small , and the total column derived from integration of the saturation - corrected composite profile is log @xmath12 ( ) = 13.52 .",
    "this saturation - corrected total column is in excellent agreement with the results from profile fitting ( summing the two components , see table  [ voigtfit ] ) , which suggests that the profile fitting properly accounts for the saturation in the case of since it provides the best match to all transitions simultaneously .",
    "what about the and profiles , for which we do not have the benefit of multiple transitions for saturation checking ?",
    "it is possible that the and especially the profiles are affected by unresolved saturation , but the effects of saturation are likely to be modest .",
    "we note that the shapes of the and @xmath52  profiles are in good agreement with the saturation - corrected profile in the main ( strongest ) component .",
    "25 km s@xmath29  in figure  [ navplot ] .",
    "while these differences could be due to inadequate correction for the wavelength calibration errors noted in the appendix or could be real differences , given the weakness of this component , the disagreement could be due to noise or the possible presence of a warm pixel at the red edge of the @xmath58 profile .",
    "] moreover , the and @xmath45values derived from profile fitting are in excellent agreement with the @xmath45values ( see table  [ voigtfit ] ) ; the profile - fitting results likely correct for the saturation adequately well .",
    "good abundances based on are particularly valuable , but we will show below that we reach the same essential conclusions for the abundances of the sub - dla if we build our analysis mainly on the saturation - corrected measurements , which are robust against this source of systematic error .",
    "we note that the column density from profile fitting is 0.2 dex higher than @xmath12 ( ) obtained from @xmath52  integration",
    ". however , the measurements are the noisiest in the set of detected lines , and in fact the columns from the two techniques agree within their 1@xmath41 uncertainties .",
    "we now turn to the abundances implied by the column densities contained in tables  [ h1col]-[voigtfit ] .",
    "we begin with the absolute metallicity of the absorber (   [ absmet ] ) , and then we examine the patterns of relative abundances from element to element and explore their implications regarding the dust content and nucleosynthetic history of the sub - dla (   [ relmet ] ) . throughout this paper",
    ", we use the solar oxygen and carbon abundances from allende prieto et al .",
    "( 2001,2002 ) , and we take the n , si , and fe solar abundances from holweger ( 2001 ) .",
    "abundance measurements in dlas and sub - dlas can suffer from uncertain corrections for ionization ( e.g. , howk & sembach 1999 ; prochaska et al .",
    "2002a ) and depletion by dust ( prochaska 2003 ) .",
    "it is well known that these problems can be largely avoided by using to determine the absolute metallicity of an absorber because ( 1 ) the ionization potentials of and are very similar , and is strongly tied to by resonant charge exchange ( field & steigman 1971 ) ; consequently , the ionization correction is so small that it can largely be neglected for , and ( 2 ) evidence from the local region of our galaxy indicates that oxygen is only lightly depleted by dust ( meyer et al . 1998 ; moos et al .",
    "2002 ; andr et al .",
    "our measurement of @xmath12 ( ) is therefore particularly advantageous for constraining the metallicity of the @xmath0  = 0.00632 absorber . using the summed column from voigt - profile fitting for the two main components ( see table  [ voigtfit ] ) and @xmath12 ( ) from the ly@xmath1  fit , we obtain @xmath59 = -1.60^{+0.09}_{-0.11}\\label{absabun}\\ ] ] where",

    ", we find that the column increases by 0.11 dex and @xmath12 ( ) increases by 0.09 dex . therefore these extra components have only a small effect ; inclusion of these components increases the metallicity by @xmath230.1 dex .",
    "another possible source of uncertainty in the oxygen abundance is the possibility that saturation has led to a substantial underestimate of @xmath12 ( ) . we have argued that saturation is unlikely to be a major problem (   [ abmeas ] ) , but we can alternatively constrain the metallicity using the saturation - corrected measurements",

    "2002 ) than that of the virgo sub - dla .",
    "therefore while the virgo absorber is apparently not as pristine as the high@xmath9 ly@xmath1 forest , it nevertheless is relatively metal - poor compared to analogous objects in the nearby universe .      beyond the overall metallicity",
    ", we have two motivations for scrutinizing the detailed pattern of element - to - element abundances in the sub - dla .",
    "first , relative abundances can provide valuable constraints on the nucleosynthetic history of the object , as has been widely discussed in the stellar abundance and qso absorption - line literature ( e.g. , lauroesch et al . 1996 ; mcwilliam 1997 ) .",
    "second , relative abundances can reveal the presence of dust through the patterns of differential depletion ( e.g. , savage & sembach 1996 ; jenkins 2003 ) .",
    "unfortunately , for many elements the nucleosynthesis signatures and dust depletion patterns can be degenerate ( prochaska 2003 ) .",
    "for this reason , nitrogen abundances are particularly valuable .",
    "nitrogen nucleosynthesis depends on the initial metallicity of the gas , and consequently in `` chemically young '' gas , nitrogen is expected ( and observed ) to be significantly underabundant ( e.g. vila costas & edmunds 1993 ; pettini et al .",
    "1995 ; henry et al .",
    "nitrogen is only lightly depleted by dust ( meyer et al . 1997 ) , so n / o provides a probe of the nucleosynthetic history that is not highly confused by dust depletion .",
    "good iron abundances are also particularly useful because fe is highly prone to depletion by dust , even in low - density , halo gas clouds ( e.g. , savage & sembach 1996 ) . consequently , iron can reveal the presence of dust when many other elements show no depletion ( see further discussion in jenkins 2003 ) .",
    "we begin our examination of the relative abundances with iron .",
    "we have only detected a single line , and moreover the line is weak and narrow .",
    "the column densities from direct integration and profile fitting agree to within their 1@xmath41 uncertainties , but the best values from the two techniques differ by 0.2 dex .",
    "if we neglect ionization corrections , we find [ fe / o ] = 0.15@xmath78 or [ fe / o ] = 0.35@xmath79 using the columns from direct integration and profile fitting , respectively . dust depletion would lead to iron underabundance , but in this case the opposite trend is seen : fe is marginally overabundant with respect to oxygen .",
    "therefore , the iron measurements indicate that _ this absorption system contains very little dust_. in principle , can also require substantial ionization corrections .",
    "however , it can be seen from figure  [ photmodel ] that with the upper limit on @xmath65 imposed by the high ions , the ionization correction is small .",
    "indeed , the ionization model in figure  [ photmodel ] adequately reproduces the column densities of all detections and limits ( except the limit ) , without requiring any depletion , at log @xmath70 .    using the 3@xmath41 upper limit on @xmath12 ( ) from table  [ intprop ] and neglecting ionization corrections , we find [ n / o ] @xmath80 in the strongest component of the pg1216 + 069 sub - dla .",
    "while this underabundance could be due to ionization effects ( e.g. , sofia & jenkins 1998 ) , the ionization model in figure  [ photmodel ] shows that this is probably not due to ionization in this case if the gas is photoionized by the background radiation from qsos .",
    "the model in figure  [ photmodel ] , which assumes that the relative abundance of nitrogen to oxygen is solar , predicts a neutral nitrogen column that is @xmath230.25 dex higher than the 3@xmath41 upper limit on @xmath12 ( ) at the best value of @xmath65 . increasing @xmath65 decreases this discrepancy , but at the upper limit on @xmath65 set by the absence of , the model still exceeds the 3@xmath41 upper limit ( see figure  [ photmodel ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the paucity of reflects a true nitrogen underabundance .",
    "our upper limit on @xmath12 ( ) in table  [ intprop ] only assumes that the linear curve of growth is applicable ; no other assumptions about the @xmath45value were made .",
    "figure  [ nitrounder ] shows the predicted profiles for both of the main components , if we assume that the n / o ratio is solar and that the components have the same @xmath45value as the detected components .",
    "although the region of the strongest transition is close to a few warm pixels , it is nevertheless evident from figure  [ nitrounder ] that a solar n / o abundance does not agree with the data .",
    "but what if the gas is also photoionized by _ embedded _",
    "stars that have a much softer spectrum than the background flux employed in figure  [ photmodel ] ?",
    "it is conceivable that the outer envelope of could provide enough shielding to prevent penetration of the absorber by photons with appropriate energy , which includes such photons , they are inefficient at production of and . ] to produce significant amounts of and , thereby satisfying the observational upper limits on these species , but lower - energy photons from internal stars could still ionize the nitrogen leading to a deficit of . in high - redshift dlas ,",
    "a striking correspondence between the absorption - profile structure of and lower - ionization stages dla and sub - dla systems often show strong high - ion absorption from species such as and , but usually the / component structure is significantly different from that of the low ions and ( see , e.g. , lu et al . 1996 ; dessauges - zavadsky et al .",

    "2000 ; lehner et al .",
    "2003 ) ; in this context , the low columns are quite probably due to ionization effects since other observations of sight lines extending beyond the local bubble boundaries suggest that the interstellar nitrogen abundance is rather uniform in the solar neighborhood , and moreover nitrogen in this region is not underabundant ( e.g. , meyer et al . 1997 ) .    considering these observations of high@xmath9 dlas and the local bubble ism , we have multiple motivations to investigate whether ionization by light from embedded stars could be responsible for the paucity of in the pg1216 + 069 sub - dla . the most straightforward way to test this hypothesis is to search for the @xmath351083.99 absorption line at the sub - dla redshift ; if the lack of is due to ionization from soft sources , then should be correspondingly strong .",
    "figure  [ fusen2spec ] shows the portion of the _ fuse _ spectrum covering the @xmath351083.99 transition at @xmath0  = 0.00632 .",
    "no significant absorption is apparent at the expected wavelength .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of the _ fuse _ spectrum is not overwhelming , but the clear detection of absorption lines from other redshifts ( see also figure  [ fuseo6spec ] ) demonstrates that the spectrum is adequate to reveal at the expected strength . due to the lower spectral resolution of _ fuse _ , the two main components of the sub - dla are blended , so we have integrated over both components to place limits on .",
    "we find that @xmath81 140.4 m  at the 3@xmath41 level . assuming the linear curve - of - growth applies , this corresponds to log @xmath12 ( ) @xmath82 14.07 .",
    "what does the limit imply ?",
    "we have computed several cloudy photoionization models assuming various soft ionizing radiation fields including stellar ionizing radiation approximated by a kurucz model atmosphere with either @xmath83 = 30,000 or 50,000 k as well as an estimate of the interstellar radiation field in the disk of the milky way ( black 1987 ) .",
    "of these three models , only the kurucz stellar atmophere spectrum with @xmath83 = 50,000 k satisfies the observed upper limit on / in the virgo sub - dla ( the other two models can not produce a low enough / ratio ) . however , when the / limit is satisfied , the 50,000 k stellar spectrum produces an column density that exceeds our 3@xmath41 upper limit . based on these models and the limit ,",
    "we conclude that internal ionization by soft sources is also an unlikely explanation of the absence of nitrogen absorption in the pg1216 + 069 sub - dla .",

    "we note that the column density ratios agree in both components to within the measurement uncertainties . the column density , however , is more reliably measured in the weaker component [ @xmath12 ( ) is uncertain in the stronger component due to saturation ] , and the carbon and oxygen columns indicate that [ c / o ] @xmath11 0 if ionization corrections are neglected .",

    "2004a ) , but so far these studies have not had sufficient information regarding the nearby galaxies to establish if they form a bound group with the overdensity expected in the fukugita et al .",
    "hypothesis or if they are situated in lower overdensity unvirialized environments as expected from the cosmological simulations .",
    "a few preliminary searches for associated with well - defined galaxy groups have been attempted ( e.g. , wakker et al .",
    "2003 ; pisano et al .",
    "2004 ) , but no definitive detections of have yet been reported . the pg1216 + 069 sight line through",
    "the ngc4261 group is appealing for this purpose because the diffuse x - ray emission establishes that the group certainly contains intragroup gas , at least in its inner regions , and because the sight line impact parameter is relatively small ( compared to available qso / group pairs bright enough for high - resolution uv spectroscopy with current facilities ) .",
    "figure  [ fuseo6spec ] shows the portion of the _ fuse _ spectrum of pg1216 + 069 covering the doublet at the redshifts of the ngc4261 group ( the expected wavelengths of at the redshift of the sub - dla are also marked ) .",
    "no absorption is evident at the ngc4261 or sub - dla redshifts .",
    "unfortunately , the stronger @xmath351031.93 line falls in a messy region affected by the galactic @xmath351039.23 absorption , a ly@xmath121 line at @xmath0  = 0.01258 , and terrestrial airglow emission lines ( feldman et al .",
    "2001).1302.17 transition in the stis spectrum , @xmath351039.23 should be detectable in the _ fuse _ data . evidently the 1039.23 line is largely filled in by terrestrial @xmath351039.23 emission . ]",
    "consequently , we must rely on the weaker line to place upper limits on the column density . integrating over the velocity range of the detected low - ionization lines in the sub - dla",
    ", we obtain a 3@xmath41 upper limit of log @xmath12 ( ) @xmath82 14.26 ; limits at the slightly higher redshift of the ngc4261 group are similar assuming a comparable velocity integration range .",
    "this constraint is limited by the modest signal - to - noise ratio of the data . nevertheless , the upper limit is comparable to the column densities of the stronger absorbers detected in other directions ( e.g. , tripp et al . 2000a ; chen & prochaska 2000 ; savage et al .",
    "2002 ; howk , prochaska , & chen 2004 ) . given the detection of x - ray emitting gas with rosat ( davis et al .",
    "1995 ) , it seems possible that the intragroup gas is too hot to show ( i.e. , the oxygen is predominantly in higher ionization stages ) .",
    "however , in this case the sub - dla might be expected to show , e.g. , from the interface between the hot x - ray gas and the low - ionization gas .",
    "the absorber properties derived above for the pg1216 + 069 sub - dla are , in some regards , surprising .",
    "the gas metallicity is extremely low given the location of the gas in a region of relatively high galaxy density near the virgo cluster and an x - ray bright galaxy group .",
    "in fact , the absolute abundance of this sub - dla is comparable to the lowest _ gas - phase _ metallicities known in the nearby universe ( see figure  [ undern ] ) .",
    "for example , the blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies i zw 18 and sbs0335 - 052 are among the most metal - poor galaxies so far found at low redshifts .",
    "analysis of region emission lines indicates that these bcd galaxies have gas - phase metallicities @xmath122 ( izotov et al .",
    "measurement of absorption lines in i zw 18 yield similar low metallicities ; possibly the abundances in the diffuse regions probed by the absorption lines are a few tenths of a dex lower than the region abundances ( aloisi et al .",
    "2003 ; lecavelier des etangs et al .",
    "even lower metallcities have been observed in high@xmath9 qso absorption systems and some galactic stars , but high@xmath9 absorbers and low - metallcity stars both probe earlier epochs in the history of the universe ; the dla discussed in this paper provides information about the _",
    "current _ metallicity of the absorbing entity .",
    "but what is the nature of the absorbing entity ?",
    "the absorber has similarites to some well - studied low@xmath9 objects .",
    "the pg1216 + 069 sub - dla is reminiscent of the bcd galaxy i zw 18 in many ways .",
    "as already noted , both objects have extremely low gas - phase metallicities . like the pg1216 + 069 sub - dla ,",
    "i zw 18 contains a lot of neutral gas ( van zee et al .",
    "1998b ; aloisi et al . 2003 ; lecavelier des etangs et al . 2004 ) . however , the most intriguing similarities of the sub - dla and the bcd galaxy are the relative metal abundances .",
    "aloisi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) find that nitrogen is highly underabundant in i zw 18 , and yet they find no clear indication of @xmath84element overabundances . on the contrary , they report that the @xmath84elements o and si are marginally _ underabundant _ with respect to iron .",
    "the abundance pattern in i zw 18 is apparently similar to the abundance pattern that we find in the virgo sub - dla ( see   [ abund ] ) .",
    "the apparent lack of an identified counterpart for the pg1216 + 069 sub - dla could be used to argue against the hypothesis that the sub - dla is somehow related to a bcd galaxy .",
    "one might expect to see evidence of a i zw 18-like galaxy in the image shown in figure  [ wfpcimage ] .",
    "however , the qso itself as well as the bright foreground star could mask a faint galaxy close to the sight line .",
    "the high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) in the vicinity of the milky way are also similar to the pg1216 + 069 sub - dla in several respects .",
    "the hvcs have comparable column densities ( wakker & van woerden 1997 ; wakker 2001 ) , and when hvc metallicities have been measured , they have showed similar abundance patterns .",
    "for example , hvc complex c has a sub - solar absolute abundance , [ o / h ] @xmath123 , it shows a significant nitrogen underabundance , and complex c iron abundances indicate that there is little or no dust depletion ( murphy et al .",
    "2000 ; richter et al . 2001 ; gibson et al .",
    "2001 ; collins et al 2003 ; tripp et al . 2003 ; sembach et al .",
    "2004b ) . in all of these respects , the pg1216 + 069",
    "virgo sub - dla is analogous to complex c , although the sub - dla has a substantially lower overall metallicity than complex c. some redshifted gas clouds analogous to the milky way hvcs have been detected in 21 cm emission studies , e.g. , the leo ring in the m96 group ( schneider 1989 ) or the large cloud near 3c 273 ( giovanelli & haynes 1989 ) .",
    "usually these 21 cm clouds have been shown to be closely associated with some type of galaxy , albeit faint in some cases ( e.g. , salzer et al . 1991 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that a lack of @xmath84element enhancement ( with respect to fe ) at low absolute metallicity has been also been observed in stars in several nearby dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies ( shetrone , ct , & sargent 2001 ; tolstoy et al .",
    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies generally have only small amounts of associated neutral interstellar gas , at least in the main galaxy where the stars are found ( e.g. , carignan 1999 ) .",
    "nevertheless , there may be a connection between high-@xmath12 ( ) absorbers and dsph s .",
    "consider the sculptor dsph galaxy . in this galaxy ,",
    "21 cm observations show little emission centered on the stars in the galaxy , but two lobes of 21 cm emission are detected at offsets of @xmath124 from the optical ( stellar ) galaxy ( carignan et al .",
    "the symmetric morphology of the 21 cm emission is suggestive of a bipolar outflow .",
    "removal of interstellar gas from dsph s , either by supernovae - driven winds or by dynamical processes ( tidal or ram - pressure stripping ) , would help to explain the paradoxical indications of extended periods of star - formation in dsph galaxies , which is difficult to reconcile with their current lack of interstellar gas ( blitz & robishaw 2000 ; grebel , gallagher , & harbeck 2003 ) .",
    "once the gas has been removed from the dsph galaxy , it could then give rise to a dla .",
    "if a qso sight line happened to pass through one of the 21 cm emission lobes near sculptor , for example , the resulting absorber properties would likely be very similar to the pg1216 + 069 sub - dla .",
    "bowen et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have searched for absorption lines in the vicinity of the dsph galaxy leo i using three background qsos / agns at projected distances ranging from 2 - 8 kpc .",
    "one of their spectra has insufficient signal - to - noise to place interesting limits , but the spectra of the other two qsos show no absorption at the velocity of leo i , and bowen et al .",
    "argue that @xmath12 ( ) @xmath125 @xmath14 within 2 - 4 kpc of that dsph .",
    "leo i therefore presents an interesting contrast to the sculptor dsph , and the bowen et al .",
    "study argues against the hypothesis that dsph s are a source of high-@xmath12 ( ) absorption systems .",
    "there are various possible explanations for the differences between sculptor , which shows high-@xmath12 ( ) in its immediate vicinity , and leo i , which apparently does not .",
    "sculptor is one of the nearest of the satellite galaxies of the milky way ; leo i is at least twice as far away .",
    "perhaps gas is only stripped when the dsph s pass close to the milky way ( blitz & robishaw 2000 ; grebel et al .",
    "2003 ) and then dissapates relatively quickly ( see bowen et al . 1997 ) . however , there are no known luminous , large galaxies near the pg1216 + 069 sight line , so if this is the correct explanation for the difference between sculptor and leo i , it then seems unlikely that the pg1216 + 069 sub - dla is related to a dsph .",
    "another possibility is that sculptor and its associated clouds are related to the magellanic stream , which is located in the sculptor direction and has similar velocities ( putman et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "a final possibility is that the pg1216 + 069 sub - dla arises in a small , ancient dark - matter minihalo that formed before the epoch of reionization and subsequently evolved largely undistrubed .",
    "abel & mo ( 1998 ) have argued that minihalos formed before reionization could accumulate and retain substantial quantities of , and moreover their densities would likely be high enough so that the objects would remain neutral after the substantial increase in background uv flux at the reionization epoch .",
    "minihalos formed after reionization would , in contrast , be more highly ionized , hotter , and less able to accrete and retain gas ( e.g. , bullock , kravtsov , & weinberg 2000 ) .",
    "maller et al . (",
    "2003 ) have recently revisited this idea , and they conclude that while minihalos are unlikely to give rise to lyman limit absorbers , they could be a significant source of sub - dla systems .",
    "the simple kinematical structure of the pg1216 + 069 sub - dla is consistent with expectations for minihalos , which would have circular velocities @xmath126 30 km s@xmath29 .",
    "kepner et al . (",
    "1999 ) have modeled the absorption - line signatures of photoionized gas in dark - matter minihalos , and their column density predictions , including the column density , the upper limit on molecular hydrogen , and the low ion / high ion column density ratios of the metals , are consistent with the observed properties of the virgo sub - dla if the sight line intercepts the minihalo at @xmath127 1 kpc ( see figures 2 and 5 in kepner et al ) .",
    "bearing in mind the caveats of ",
    "[ physcon ] , it is interesting to note that the line - of - sight thickness of the best - fitting cloudy model shown in figure  [ photmodel ] would be consistent with the size implied by the kepner et al .",
    "model if log @xmath128 .",
    "given that there could be some starlight that contributes to the ionizing flux ( which makes the absorber thickness smaller ) , the kepner et al .",
    "size can be reconciled with the photoionization models for the pg1216 + 069 sub - dla .",
    "the sub - dla metallicity is larger than metallicities typically derived for diffuse ly@xmath1 forest gas at high redshifts , so this hypothesis would require some self - enrichment from internal stars in the minihalo .",
    "very low - level star formation and self enrichment are plausible , e.g. , triggered by occassional perturbations of the gas , but one weakness of this idea is that a small number of supernovae could blow away the gas in the minihalo .",
    "using a new high - resolution observation of pg1216 + 069 obtained with the e140 m echelle mode of stis , we have identified a nearby sub - damped ly@xmath1  absorber at @xmath0  = 0.00632 with log @xmath12 ( ) = 19.32@xmath20.03 .",
    "this absorption system has several remarkable properties .",
    "first , the overall metal abundance is surprisingly low ; we find [ o / h ] = @xmath3 and @xmath129 [ si / h ] @xmath130 .",
    "these are among the lowest metallicity measurements _ in the gas phase _ known in the nearby universe ( stars can have much lower abundances , but low stellar abundances are fossils that mainly provide information about earlier epochs ) .",
    "second , the iron abundance indicates that this absorber harbors very little dust .",
    "third , nitrogen is significantly underabundant , which indicates that the gas is `` chemically young '' .",
    "however , comparison of the oxygen , silicon , and iron abundances shows no significant evidence of @xmath84element overabundances .",
    "fourth , although the gas is situated in the outer reaches of the virgo galaxy cluster and the ngc4261 galaxy group , there are no known luminous galaxies within the projected distance that might be expected for such a high-@xmath12 ( ) absorber .",
    "the nearest @xmath7 galaxy is ngc4260 at a projected distance of 246 @xmath114 kpc , and even the closest known sub - luminous galaxy is at a substantial projected distance , @xmath6 kpc .",
    "we place limits on absorption associated with the ngc4261 galaxy group , which is known to have hot intragroup gas from detection for diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "the abundance patterns in the sub - dla are reminiscent of abundances in nearby dwarf galaxies and of gas - phase abundances in high - velocity clouds near the milky way .",
    "we discuss the possibility that this absorber is related to a dwarf galaxy and/or a high - velocity cloud in the outer region of the virgo galaxy cluster .",
    "it is also possible that the pg1216 + 069 sub - dla arises in a small dark - matter halo . in this case , it is likely that the halo formed and accumlated gas in the early universe before reionization occurred , and since that time has only undergone meager self - enrichment from internal star formation .",
    "several future measurements would be helpful for understanding the nature of this absorber .",
    "better measurements of the fe abundance would be valuable for learning about relative abundance patterns in the sub - dla ; in addition , the strong lines and higher signal - to - noise achievable with the far - uv mode of stis would enable detection of weaker absorption components .",
    "we have shown that weak components will not affect the derived total abundances much , but the _ kinematics _ implied by the presence ( or absence ) of higher velocity features would be useful for testing the small dark - matter halo interpretation . a minihalo should have a low circular velocity and simple kinematics , and high - velocity weak components are not expected in this model .",
    "a deep 21 cm emission map with high spatial resolution at virgo redshifts would test several of the possible interpretations we have presented for the sub - dla . for example , if the sub - dla is part of a tidally - stripped gas structure or is analogous to the ring in the m96 group or the giovanelli & haynes cloud , this would be revealed by deep 21 cm observations .",
    "moreover , such structures would have clearly different morphologies from a minihalo or compact high - velocity cloud .",
    "narrow - band h@xmath1 imaging could also provide useful clues about the nature of the sub - dla , e.g. , to search for evidence of a faint star - forming galaxy near the sight line .",
    "regardless of the detailed nature of the absorber , this observation unambiguously shows that relatively primitive gas that has undergone little chemical enrichment ( compared to metallicities in high - redshift gases ) is still found at the present epoch .",
    "this paper benefitted from valuable discussions with ari maller , max pettini , blair savage , ken sembach , and jason tumlinson .",
    "we also appreciate useful comments from the referee .",
    "the stis observations were obtained under the auspices of _ hst _ program 9184 , with financial support through nasa grant hst - go-9184.08-a from the space telescope science institute .",
    "we also appreciate and acknowledge support from nasa ltsa grant nng04gg73 g .",
    "the _ fuse _ data were obtained by the pi team of the nasa - cnes - csa _ fuse _ project , which is operated by johns hopkins university with financial support through nasa contract nas 5 - 32985 .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with nasa .",
    "according to the cycle 13 stis handbook , the relative wavelength calibration of stis spectra recorded with the mama detectors is accurate to 0.25 - 0.5 pixels across an exposure , and the absolute wavelength calibration ( i.e. , the zero point ) is good to 0.5@xmath371.0 pixels ( kim quijano et al .",
    "we have examined many spectra obtained with the stis echelle modes ( which use the mama detectors ) , and in general we have found the wavelength calibration to be excellent .",
    "jenkins & tripp ( 2001 ) noticed small wavelength calibration errors in a particular order of a set of e230h spectra , but in various projects using stis e140 m spectra of a large number of targets , we have usually found that absorption lines ( that are appropriate for comparison ) are well - aligned across the full wavelength range of stis echelle spectra , in agreement with the accuracies reported in the stis handbook .",
    "consequently , we were surprised to find evidence of somewhat larger wavelength calibration errors in the stis e140 m echelle spectrum of pg1216 + 069 .",
    "we find indications that the relative wavelength calibration errors are as large as @xmath231 pixel .",
    "some of this evidence is shown in figures  [ oshift]-[feshift ] .",
    "figures  [ oshift ] and [ sishift ] compare @xmath52  profiles of several of the absorption lines in the @xmath0  = 0.00632 absorption system . in the left panels in these figures ,",
    "no shifts have been applied to the wavelength scale in the final reduced spectrum .",
    "differences in the velocity centroids of these lines are readily apparent . in the right panels in figures  [ oshift]-[sishift ] , shifts of @xmath231 pixel have been applied to several of the lines , as described in the captions .",
    "clearly , the @xmath231 pixel corrections improve the alignment of the various lines observed in this absorber . in this paper , we have shifted lines at @xmath131 1200   and @xmath132 1330   by + 3.5 km s@xmath29 .",
    "do we expect the transitions in figures  [ oshift]-[sishift ] to be well aligned ? could some multiphase / multicomponent aspect of the absorber cause real differences in the kinematics of the various species compared in these figures ? the transitions in figure  [ sishift ] should all show the same kinematical behavior .",
    "multiple components that are blended and unresolved could lead to confusing line profile differences in comparisons of strong and weak transitions of a particular species ( because column density components can be detectable in the strong lines but not the weak ones ) .",
    "however , comparisons of the weaker transitions ( e.g. , 1304.37 vs. 1526.71 ) as well as weak vs. strong transitions ( e.g. , 1260.42 and 1526.71 ) consistently require the same shifts , which suggests that this not a component structure effect .",
    "moreover , several other line comparisions consistently indicate that the same wavelength scale corrections are needed .",
    "we find that lines at @xmath133 1330   and @xmath134 1200   must be shifted compared to lines within the 1200 - 1330   range .",
    "for example , figure  [ oshift ] shows several species that are the dominant ionization stage in regions ; these lines require the same shifts seen in the lines in figure  [ sishift ] . in principle , dominant ions such as , , and could arise in ionized gas as well as the neutral gas , and this could cause profile differences , but the fact that the same shifts are indicated by the data in figure  [ oshift ] argues that this is not an ionization effect . similarly , figure  [ feshift ] overplots the milky way @xmath351259.52 and @xmath351608.45 @xmath52profiles , and the same shift leads to significantly improved alignment of these galactic lines .",
    "the and lines in figure  [ feshift ] are expected to have very similar strengths based on the abundances of these species in the ism and their atomic data , and these lines are expected to be well - aligned . in this case , greater depletion of fe by dust might generate profile differences , but since the same velocity shift is again mandated , we believe that the difference in the left panel of figure  [ feshift ] is more likely due to wavelength calibration errors .",
    "we have also reduced the pg1216 + 069 e140 m spectrum using the stsci pipeline , and we find that the final pipeline spectrum is very similar to our spectrum ( which was reduced with the stis team software ) and shows the same evidence of wavelength scale errors .",
    "we conclude that the pg1216 + 069 spectrum shows unusually large relative wavelength errors compared to most stis echelle spectra that we have studied . however , even with these larger errors , the wavelength calibration is still very good compared to most archival uv spectra obtained with other _ hst _ instruments and other space - borne uv facilities .",

    "<S> the absorber shows no evidence of highly - ionized gas , which places constraints on `` warm - hot '' missing baryons in the x - ray bright ngc4261 group . </S>",
    "<S> the well - developed damping wings of the ly@xmath1  line tightly constrain the column density ; we find log n ( ) = 19.32@xmath20.03 . </S>",
    "<S> the metallicity of this sub - dla is remarkably low , [ o / h ] = @xmath3 , which is comparable to many analogous high - redshift systems , and the iron abundance indicates that this absorber contains little or no dust . </S>",
    "<S> nitrogen is underabundant : we detect neither nor , and we show that the absence of nitrogen is not due to ionization effects but rather indicates that [ n / o ] @xmath4 . despite the proximity of the sight line to ngc4261 group , there are no bright galaxies with small impact parameters at the absorption redshift : the nearest known galaxy is a sub@xmath5 galaxy with a projected distance @xmath6 kpc , while the closest @xmath7 galaxy is ngc4260 at @xmath8 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> the low metallicity and nitrogen underabundance indicate that this low@xmath9 sub - dla is a relatively primitive gas cloud . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the nature and origin of the sub - dla , and we discuss several possibilities . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of the sub - dla are similar to those of the interstellar media in blue compact dwarf galaxies and are also reminiscent of milky way hvcs . </S>",
    "<S> the sub - dla could also be related to a dwarf spheroidal galaxy , if the absorption arises in gas ejected or stripped from such an object . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the object could simply be a small dark - matter halo , self - enriched by a small amount of internal star formation but mostly undisturbed since its initial formation . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the small halo would likely be an ancient building block of galaxy formation that formed before the epoch of reionization . </S>"
