    ", several models were computed to study the overshoot of convective motions from unstable into the upper stable layer in a non - rotating configuration .",
    "it was found that the motions from the convective region penetrate a significant fraction of pressure scale height into the stable layer above .",
    "singh et al . (",
    "1994 ) also found that the penetration distance above the convection zone ( @xmath3 ) scales as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the input flux and @xmath6 is the density at the top of the convection zone .",
    "robinson et al . ( 2004 ) performed three - dimensional simulations of the upper radiation - convection transition layer with more realistic modeling for three subgiant stars .",
    "for the present sun they found the overshoot to be @xmath7 , for the @xmath8-gyr subgiant it was @xmath9 , while for a @xmath10-gyr subgiant it was approximately @xmath11 , @xmath12 being the local pressure scale height .",

    "( 2007 ) examined the behaviour of penetrative convection below a convection zone under the influence of rotation by means of three - dimensional simulations .",
    "they found that with an increase in rotational velocity , the downward penetration decreased .",
    "a similar behaviour was observed when the stability of the lower stable layer was increased in a rotating configuration .",
    "furthermore , the relative stability parameter @xmath2 showed an @xmath13 dependence on the penetration distance implying the existence of a thermal adjustment region in the lower stable layer rather than a nearly adiabatic penetration zone .",
    "ziegler & rdiger ( 2003 ) and kpyl et al . ( 2004 ) , using their 3d mhd codes also found that , as a general feature , the overshooting at the bottom decreases as a function of increasing rotation at a given latitude .    browning et al .",
    "( 2004 ) performed three - dimensional simulations of core convection within a - type stars at a range of rotation rates .",
    "they found that as convective motions enter the stable stratification of the radiative envelope , increasing the rotation rate enhances the overshooting .    in this paper",
    ", we perform large eddy simulations of turbulent convection in a _ f_-plane configuration to study the effect of rotation on the penetration distance above the convection zone .",
    "a total of 17 two - layer ( lower unstable  upper stable ) models have been set up to examine the effect of rotation rate ( @xmath0 ) and colatitude ( @xmath1 ) on the penetration distance . in some models",

    "the general behaviour of convective transport in a stellar - type setting has been studied using large eddy simulation ( les ) approach by several groups ( chan & sofia 1986 , hossain & mullan 1991 , 1993 , muthsam et al .",

    "( 2007 ) numerically solved the navir - stokes equations and incorporated the rotational effects by considering an _ f_-plane configuration .",
    "a plane parallel layer of perfect gas was considered in a rectangular box which can be viewed as a small portion of a spherical shell .",
    "we use a configuration that is similar to that of pal et al .",
    "( 2007 ) except that the computational domain has two layers ( lower unstable  upper stable ) rather than their three layer sandwich ( stable - unstable - stable ) configuration .",
    "the choice is justified as we are interested in studying the behaviour of penetrative convection above a convection zone rather than below as was the aim of pal et al .",
    "the spherical shell rotates around the polar axis from west to east and the angular velocity vector @xmath0 points toward the north pole .",

    "the rectangular computational domain has an aspect ratio of 1.5 and a mesh of @xmath19 points .",
    "the top and bottom boundaries are kept impenetrable and stress - free while the side boundaries are made periodic .",
    "the domain is divided into two layers with the convectively unstable layer positioned below the convectively stable one .",
    "a constant flux @xmath20 is fed from the bottom and all the thermodynamic variables are expressed in units which set the total depth and initial density , pressure and temperature at the top to unity .",

    "models r1 to r13 are computed to examine the effect of rate of rotation ( @xmath0 ) and the angle ( @xmath1 ) between the rotation vector and the vertical axis on the extent of penetration below the convectively stable layer .",
    "the polytropic index of the upper stable layer is taken to be 2.0 in all these models ( r1-r13 ) . in models",

    "r7 , and r12 , @xmath0 is 0.25 , 0.5 and 1.0 , respectively , while @xmath1 is fixed at @xmath56 . in the last set of models",
    "r14 to r16 , polytropic index of the upper stable layer is varied from 3 to 5 while all the other parameters are the same as model r7 .",
    "another model r17 , having a grid of @xmath57 points and all other parameters same as r7 ( @xmath0 @xmath58 ) is computed to examine the effect of increase in the number of grid points ( resolution ) in the horizontal plane .    as described , four models , namely , r7",
    ", r14 , r15 and r16 have been set - up to examine the effect of stability of the upper stable layer on the penetration height of these rotating configurations .",
    "each of these four models have different polytropic indices in the upper stable layer , namely , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 for the cases r7 , r14 , r15 and r16 , respectively . for all these four models , the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "are kept constant at 0.5 and @xmath56 respectively .",
    "similar to the relative stability parameter @xmath2 for the lower stable layer ( hurlburt et al .",
    "1994 , singh et al .",
    "1995 , pal et al .",
    "2007 ) , we can define a relative stability parameter for the upper stable layer for these four cases as :      where @xmath60 denote the polytropic indices of the upper stable layer for various cases , @xmath61 is the polytropic index of the upper stable layer for our case r7 and @xmath62 is the adiabatic index . here , we have taken @xmath63 as 5/3 .",
    "thus , for our reference case r7 the relative stability parameter @xmath2 is equal to unity and for cases r14 , r15 and r16 it comes out to be 3 , 5 and 7 , respectively .       for rotation about a vertical axis ( @xmath64 ) , the penetration into the upper stable region increases as the angular rotational velocity ( @xmath0 ) increases or the rossby number ( @xmath42 ) decreases .",
    "however , this trend is reversed for rotation around an inclined axis .",
    "when the angle ( @xmath65 ) , the penetration distance into the radiative envelope decreases with increasing @xmath0 owing to horizontal mixing .",
    "to see the effect of change of angle of inclination on penetration , angle @xmath1 is systematically varied from @xmath55 to @xmath54 in steps of @xmath53 for five models with a fixed angular velocity @xmath0@xmath66 .",
    "we again find that the penetration distance decreases as the colatitude @xmath1 is increased .",
    "we do not see this behaviour changing even when the resolution is increased .",
    "we also find that the penetration distance above the convection zone obeys a scaling relation of the form @xmath67 appropriate for nearly adiabatic penetration even in the presence of rotation .",
    "the present simulations need to be extended to include more realistic input physics and a higher resolution to enable us to get a better insight into the dynamics of rotating convection near the convective - radiative interface .",
    "since the motivation of the study was to look into the effect of varying rotation rates on the penetration distance , we needed to compute several models . due to the restrictions in speed and memory , we were unable to increase the resolution of all the models .",
    "we hope to achieve this in future studies .",
