    "nonequilibrium phenomena are observed throughout nature and society , and can often be thought of as some kind of driven diffusive system @xcite .",
    "examples include chemical kinetics , the motion of interacting molecular motors along a substrate , population dynamics in an ecology , the exchange of wealth or commodities in an economy , traffic flow and many more .",
    "the ongoing interest in driven systems has been sustained by the wide variety of behaviour the model systems exhibit , which incorporate not only elements familiar from equilibrium statistical mechanics , such as phase transitions , cooperative behaviour , and so on , but also many dramatic new features .",
    "these include phase transitions induced by external driving and even in one dimension ; long - range ( i.e. power - law ) correlations , not only at criticality , but generically in the steady state ; and very rich dynamics .    model driven diffusive systems are typically defined on a lattice on which particles hop from site to site , where the precise definition of the stochastic particle dynamics is motivated on physical grounds .",
    "nonequilibrium steady states are constructed by driving a current of particles through the system . despite being simply stated , they still exhibit the wide range of phenomena .",
    "indeed , a virtue of their simplicity is that in some cases the models can be solved exactly .",
    "however , most cases elude exact solution ; moreover , even in cases where the steady state can be written down , the task of computing macroscopic observables may be too difficult . for these reasons , it is necessary to develop approximate techniques .",
    "a technique that has been hugely successful in equilibrium statistical mechanics is the renormalisation group procedure . here",
    ", we show how one can adapt these equilibrium methods to nonequilibrium systems , where we devise a way to accommodate the feature that distinguishes the nonequilibrium steady state from its equilibrium counterpart  the existence of currents  in the renormalisation group prescription .",
    "in particular , our approach includes the effects of fluctuations , which , in certain equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems , destroy the transitions predicted by mean field theory .",
    "thus our approach builds on previous prescriptions @xcite , and it complements real - space techniques devised for quantum - spin chains , and adapted to stochastic models @xcite .",
    "we test our approach using the asymmetric simple exclusion process with open boundaries , which we introduce and review in section [ asep ] . in section [ mp ]",
    ", we outline the matrix product formulation of the master equation .",
    "this formulation provides a convenient notation for the purposes of the steady state renormalisation which we describe in section [ ssrg ] .",
    "we recover the exact critical point and find qualitative agreement for the phase diagram .",
    "we extend the renormalisation to the dynamics in section [ drg ] and again we obtain qualitative agreement with the exact predictions for the relaxation dynamics .",
    "the asymmetric simple exclusion process with open boundaries is one of the most widely studied driven diffusive systems .",
    "exact results show that it undergoes both first- and second order phase transitions in the steady state and exhibits different relaxation dynamics in each of its phases . for these reasons",
    ", it represents an ideal test bed with which to assess the efficacy of approximate methods .",
    "the model is defined on a chain of @xmath0 sites , labelled @xmath1 .",
    "the occupation variable @xmath2 if site @xmath3 is vacant and @xmath4 if it is occupied ; multiple occupancy is forbidden .",
    "the stochastic dynamics are illustrated in figure [ asep dynamics ] : in continuous time , a particle at site @xmath5 hops to its nearest neighbour site to the right with rate @xmath6 , provided it is empty .",
    "if site 1 is vacant , it becomes occupied with rate @xmath7 , and if there is a particle at site @xmath0 , it leaves the system with rate @xmath8 .",
    "the phase diagram for this model is known exactly @xcite . in the limit of large @xmath0 , depending on the values of the ratios @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the system may reside in one of three possible phases ( see figure [ phase diagram ] ) : for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the system is in a low density phase with particle density @xmath13 ; for @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the system is in a high density phase , @xmath16 ; for @xmath17 and @xmath18 the current , @xmath19,through the system assumes its maximum value @xmath20 and the density @xmath21 .",
    "the transition between the high and low density phases , indicated by the dotted line in the phase diagram , is first order  along the transition line a low density region coexists with a high density region and the system density @xmath21 .",
    "the transition between these low current phases and the maximum current phase , indicated by the solid line in the phase diagram , is second order .",
    "the relaxation dynamics have also been obtained recently using the bethe ansatz @xcite : in the maximum current phase the relaxation time scales as @xmath22 where the dynamic exponent @xmath23 ; along the coexistence line @xmath24 ; in the two low current phases away from the coexistence line , the relaxation times are finite .",
    "the exact solution for the steady state of the asep was obtained using a matrix product technique @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the aim is to represent the probability that one observes the system in a configuration @xmath25 at time @xmath26 , @xmath27 , as @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are ( in general time - dependent ) matrices , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are ( time - independent ) vectors . here",
    ", @xmath33 is a normalisation given by @xmath34 where we have introduced the ( time - independent ) matrix @xmath35 .",
    "thus , a string of matrices is used to represent a configuration of the particles in the system , where the matrix @xmath29 is used to represent an occupied site and @xmath30 a vacant site .      in the limit @xmath36 , it was shown in @xcite that",
    "( [ probabilities ] ) and ( [ normalisation ] ) do indeed give the steady state probabilities provided the matrices @xmath29 and @xmath30 and the vectors @xmath31 and @xmath32 satisfy the algebra @xmath37 moreover , matrix representations were found which satisfy ( [ bulk algebra])-([rh boundary condition ] ) .",
    "we remark however that in order to compute the probabilities to observe a particular configuration , it is not necessary to find such matrix representations ; it is instead sufficient to use ( [ bulk algebra ] ) to order all the matrices @xmath30 to the left of the matrices @xmath29 , and then use the boundary conditions ( [ lh boundary condition ] ) and ( [ rh boundary condition ] ) to obtain probabilities in terms of @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath6 .      in @xcite , it was shown how the steady state algebra can be generalised to a full dynamic algebra such that ( [ probabilities ] ) and ( [ normalisation ] ) represent the probabilities at all times @xmath26 . in this case",
    ", the matrices and vectors must satisfy @xmath38\\;,\\label{eqn of motion}\\\\ \\lambda c^{-1}d = dc^{-1}\\lambda\\;,\\\\ \\langle w|(\\alpha / p - c^{-1}\\lambda ) = 0\\;,\\\\ ( \\beta / p - \\lambda c^{-1}|v\\rangle = 0\\label{dynamic rh bc}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is a current operator ( capturing the fact that in order for a particle to hop there must be a particle to the left of a vacancy ) .",
    "the key feature which distinguishes nonequilibrium steady states from equilibrium ones is the presence of currents .",
    "moreover , in driven diffusive systems with open boundaries , the boundary dynamics determine the particle current and density throughout the bulk of the system .",
    "this is in marked contrast to equilibrium systems where boundary effects are typically localised to the vicinity of the boundary .    in this section",
    ", we present a renormalisation group method which accounts for these currents by employing a blocking procedure designed to accommodate the influence of the boundaries throughout the bulk of the system .",
    "a blocking transformation is implemented by grouping sites of the lattice into blocks where each block contains @xmath40 sites , as illustrated for the case @xmath41 in figure [ blocking ] .     sites . ]",
    "these blocks are then identified with the sites of a renormalised lattice with a number of sites @xmath42 .",
    "this must be supplemented by a prescription which identifies particle configurations within a block with a single coarse - grained block variable .",
    "we achieve this by using a majority rule identification , which for @xmath41 is @xmath43    the issue for any such renormalisation group treatment then is what quantities are held fixed under the blocking and which are rescaled . we keep the current across each bond @xmath19 and the bulk density @xmath44 fixed , and rescale the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 . to achieve this , we consider pairs of adjacent blocks separately , and replace the effect of particle exchange with the rest of the system with particle injection and ejection at the boundaries of the pair of blocks , with rates @xmath9 and @xmath10 , as illustrated in figure [ asep blocking ] .    . ]",
    "thus the current and density in the rescaled system are written @xmath45 under the majority rule matching between configurations , ( [ maj d ] ) , ( [ maj e ] ) , the block current @xmath19 and the block density @xmath44 assume the form @xmath46 note that we impose that neither the vectors and @xmath31 and @xmath32 nor the matrix algebra ( [ bulk algebra ] ) to ( [ rh boundary condition ] ) are changed under the rescaling .",
    "this reflects the fact that both the scaled and the unscaled configurations are taken to evolve under the same stochastic dynamics : any extension of the parameter space is prohibited under the rescaling .",
    "finally , the rescaling of the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 is achieved by setting @xmath47 and @xmath48 .      up to this point",
    ", the use of the matrix product formulation has been nothing more than a choice of notation .",
    "the task now is to evaluate the correlation functions ( [ j ] ) to ( [ rho ] ) and this is relatively straightforward if one makes use of the algebra ( [ bulk algebra ] ) to ( [ rh boundary condition ] ) , though we remark that even here the algebra only simplifies the calculations : one could evaluate the relevant correlations directly from the master equation , for example . for the case",
    "@xmath50 one obtains ( still for @xmath41 ) @xmath51 which is also the result obtained in the exact solution for @xmath52 , and @xmath53 from matching @xmath47 , where @xmath54 .",
    "stable fixed points of this equation , @xmath55 , are found at @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and these are separated by an unstable fixed point at @xmath58 . at the unstable fixed point , @xmath59 .",
    "thus the @xmath56 fixed point represents the low - current phase , and the transition between this phase and the maximum current phase is given by the unstable fixed point , for which we recover the exact value @xmath58 .",
    "moreover the current and density at this point are also given by their exactly known values throughout the maximum current phase : @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "for @xmath61 the scaling equations are straightforward to obtain , but rather lengthy so we do not include them here .",
    "their fixed point structure is given in table [ fixed points ] .",
    ".fixed points of the steady state blocking transformation for @xmath41 .",
    "the values given as decimals are evaluated numerically  all the rest are determined analytically .",
    "the fixed points depicted in the flow diagram shown in figure [ flow diagram ] are labelled a to g. [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we also show the exact values which have only recently been obtained @xcite .",
    "our results appear to capture the crossover from @xmath23 dynamics in the maximum current phase ( represented by point a ) to @xmath24 dynamics along the coexistence line ( represented by point d ) .",
    "one can also obtain scaling equations for the case @xmath62 in order to probe the dynamics at points b and c in the flow diagram , points which represent the high and low density phases , respectively .",
    "one finds that at both b and c , @xmath63 for all @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "this implies there is no system size dependence in the leading contribution to the gap for large @xmath0 , which is consistent with the exact prediction of finite relaxation times in the low current phases away from the coexistence line @xcite .",
    "we have developed a renormalisation group procedure which we have applied to the boundary driven asymmetric simple exclusion process . in the steady state transformation , exact results for the critical point are recovered as well as a flow diagram that shares the qualitative structure of the exact phase diagram .",
    "the dynamic scaling also captures the crossovers in the exactly computed relaxation dynamics in each phase of the asep .",
    "these scaling methods seem to be widely applicable : they can be generalised to higher dimensions , multiple particle species and multiple site occupancy . since only small clusters give , through the scaling , even the highly correlated properties , the scaling does not depend on the availability of exact results , and may be particularly useful in cases where the exact steady state can be written down but any calculation of macroscopic properties remains difficult .",
    "they are also direct and straightforward to interpret , without requiring any translation from quantum spins or abstract fields as in field - theoretic methods .",
