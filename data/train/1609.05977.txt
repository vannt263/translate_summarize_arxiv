    "invasion of influenza virus into a host s upper respiratory tract leads to infection of healthy epithelial cells and subsequent production of progeny virions @xcite .",
    "infection also triggers a variety of immune responses . in the early stage of infection a temporary non - specific response ( innate immunity ) contributes to the rapid control of viral growth while in the late stage of infection , the adaptive immune response dominates viral clearance @xcite .",
    "the early immune response involves production of antiviral cytokines and cells , e.g. type 1 interferon ( ifn ) and natural killer cells ( nk cells ) , and is independent of virus type @xcite . in the special case of a first infection in a naive host ,",
    "the adaptive immune response , mediated by the differentiation of naive t cells and b cells and subsequent production of virus - specific t cells and antibodies @xcite , leads to not only a prolonged killing of infected cells and virus but also the formation of memory cells which can generate a rapid immune response to secondary infection with the same virus @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 t cells , which form a major component of adaptive immunity , play an important role in efficient viral clearance @xcite .",
    "however , available evidence suggests they are unable to clear virus in the absence of antibodies @xcite except in hosts with a very high level of pre - existing naive or memory @xmath0 t cells @xcite .",
    "some studies indicate that depletion of @xmath0 t cells could decrease the viral clearance rate and thus prolong the duration of infection @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a recent study of human a(h7n9 ) hospitalized patients has implicated the number of effector @xmath0 t cells as an important driver of the duration of infection @xcite .",
    "this diverse experimental and clinical data , sourced from a number of host - species , indicates that timely activation and elevation of @xmath0 t cell levels may play a major role in the rapid and successful clearance of influenza virus from the host .",
    "these observations motivate our modeling study of the role of @xmath0 t cells in influenza virus clearance .",
    "viral dynamics models have been extensively applied to the investigation of the antiviral mechanisms of @xmath0 t cell immunity against a range of pathogens , with major contributions for chronic infections such as hiv / siv @xcite , htlv - i @xcite and chronic lcmv @xcite . however , for acute infections such as measles @xcite and influenza @xcite , highly dynamical interactions between the viral load and the immune response occur within a very short time window , presenting new challenges for the development of models incorporating @xmath0 t cell immunity .",
    "existing influenza viral dynamics models , introduced to study specific aspects of influenza infection , are limited in their ability to capture all major aspects of the natural history of infection , hindering their use in studying the role of @xmath0 t cells in viral clearance .",
    "some models show a severe depletion of target cells ( i.e healthy epithelial cells susceptible to viral infection ) after viral infection @xcite",
    ". depletion may be due to either infection or immune - mediated protection .",
    "either way , these models are arguably incompatible with recent evidence that the host is susceptible to re - infection with a second strain of influenza a short period following primary exposure @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as reviewed by dobrovolny _",
    "@xcite , target cell depletion in these models strongly limits viral expansion so that virus can be effectively controlled or cleared at early stage of infection even in the absence of adaptive immunity , which contradicts the experimental finding that influenza virus remains elevated in the absence of adaptive immune response @xcite . while a few models do avoid target cell depletion @xcite , they either assume immediate replenishment of target cells @xcite or a slow rate of virus invasion into target cells resulting in a much delayed peak of virus titer at day 5 post - infection ( rather than the observed peak at day 2 ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , models with missing or unspecified major immune components , e.g. no innate immunity @xcite , no antibodies @xcite or unspecified adaptive immunity @xcite , also indicate the need for further model development . for an in - depth review of the current virus dynamics literature on influenza ,",

    "panel ( b ) demonstrates how the presence of pre - existing memory @xmath0 t cells ( solid dots ) leads to a shorter recovery time when compared to the case where no memory @xmath0 t cells are established ( open circles ) .",
    "note the time scale difference in panels ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "this simulation is based on the assumption that the level of pre - existing memory @xmath0 t cells is assumed to be either 1% or 5% ( as indicated in the legend ) of the maximum effector @xmath0 t cell number due to primary viral infection .",
    "the memory cell number ( which is not shown in this figure ) is about 30 time as many as the naive cell number shown in the figure , i.e.  30 naive cells result in about 900 memory cells before re - infection . ]",
    "8a shows how the pre - existing memory @xmath0 t cell number ( @xmath75 ) changes the exponential relationship between naive @xmath0 t cells and recovery time .",
    "importantly , as the number of memory @xmath0 t cells increases , the recovery time decreases for any level of naive @xmath0 t cells and the exponential relationship remains .",
    "the extent of reduction in the recovery time for a relatively low level of naive @xmath0 t cells is greater than that for a relatively high level of naive @xmath0 t cells .",
    "this suggests that people with a lower level of naive @xmath0 t cells may benefit more through induction of memory @xmath0 t cells , emphasizing the potential importance for taking prior population immunity into consideration when designing @xmath0 t cell - based vaccines @xcite .",
    "the above result is based on the assumption that the initial memory @xmath0 t cell number upon re - infection is independent of the number of naive @xmath0 t cells available during the previous infection .",
    "however , it has also been found that the stationary level of memory @xmath0 t cells is usually maintained at about 510% of the maximum antigen - specific @xmath0 t cell number during primary viral infection @xcite .",
    "this indicates that people with a low naive @xmath0 t cell number may also develop a low level of memory @xmath0 t cells following infection . in consequence",
    ", such individuals may be relatively more susceptible to viral re - infection @xcite .",
    "this alternative and arguably more realistic relationship between the numbers of naive and memory @xmath0 t cells is simulated in fig .",
    "8b where memory @xmath0 t cell levels are set to 5% of the maximum of the effector @xmath0 t cell level .",
    "results suggest that , upon viral re - infection , pre - existing memory @xmath0 t cells are able to significantly improve recovery time except for in hosts with a very low level of naive @xmath0 t cells ( fig .",
    "this is in accordance with the assumption that a smaller naive pool leads to a smaller memory pool and in turn a weaker shortening in recovery time .",
    "although the model suggests that the failure of memory @xmath0 t cells to protect the host is unlikely to be observed ( because of the approximately 30 fold increase in the size of the memory pool relative to the naive pool ) , the failure range may be increased if the memory pool size is much smaller ( modulated by , say , changing 5% to 1% in the model ) .",
    "therefore , for people with a low naive @xmath0 t cell number , the level of memory @xmath0 t cells may be insufficient and prior infection may provide very limited benefit , further emphasizing the opportunity for novel vaccines that are able to induce a strong memory @xmath0 t cell response to improve clinical outcomes .       t cell number and recovery time .",
    "recovery time is defined to be the time when viral load falls to 1 @xmath68 .",
    "different antibody levels are simulated by varying the initial number of naive b cells ( i.e. @xmath52 at @xmath80 ) . ]",
    "antibodies appear at a similar time as effector @xmath0 t cells during influenza viral infection and may enhance the reduction in the recovery time in addition to @xmath0 t cells . by varying the naive b cell number @xmath52 ( as a convenient , but by no means unique , way to influence antibody level ) , we find that increasing the antibody level shortens the recovery time regardless of the initial naive @xmath0 t cell number , leaving the exponential relation largely intact ( fig .  9 ) .",
    "a slight saturation occurs for the case in which levels of both naive b cells and @xmath0 t cells are low .",
    "moreover , variation in naive b cell number also results in a wider variation in recovery time for a lower naive @xmath0 t cell level , suggesting that people with a lower level of naive @xmath0 t cells may , once again , receive a more significant benefit ( in terms of recovery time ) through effective induction of an antibody response via vaccination .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the role of @xmath0 t cells in clearing influenza virus from the host using a viral dynamics model .",
    "the model was calibrated on a set of published murine data from miao _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and has been further shown to be able to reproduce a range of published data from experiments with different immune components knocked out . by avoiding target - cell depletion ,",
    "our model is also compatible with re - infection data @xcite , providing a strong platform on which to examine the role of @xmath0 t cells in determining recovery time from infection .",
    "our primary finding is that the time of recovery from influenza viral infection is negatively correlated with the level of effector @xmath0 t cells in an approximately exponential manner .",
    "this robust property of infection has been identified from the model when calibrated against influenza a(h3n2 ) infection data in mice @xcite , but also observed in clinical case series of influenza a(h7n9 ) infection in humans ( fig .",
    "7 ) @xcite .",
    "our findings , in conjunction with conclusions on the potential role for a t cell vaccine that stimulates and/or boosts the memory response , suggest new directions for research in both non - human species and further studies in humans on the association between @xmath0 t cell levels and clinical outcomes .",
    "further research , including detailed statistical fitting of our model to an extensive panel of infection data ( as yet unavailable ) from human and non - human species , is required to establish the generality of these relationships and provide quantitative insights for specific viruses in relevant hosts .",
    "the non - linear relationship between effector @xmath0 t cell level and recovery time may be useful in clinical treatment .",
    "the saturated property of the relation implies that a linear increase in the effector @xmath0 t cell level may result in diminishing incremental improvements in patient recovery times .",
    "with evidence of a possible age - dependent loss of naive t cells @xcite , our model results imply that boosting the @xmath0 t cell response via t cell vaccination may be particularly useful for those with insufficient naive @xmath0 t cells .",
    "the population - level consequences of such boosting strategies , while beyond the scope of this work , have previously been considered by the authors @xcite .",
    "we also investigated the effect of memory @xmath0 t cell level on viral clearance and found unsurprisingly that a high pre - existing level of memory @xmath0 t cells was always beneficial .",
    "however , our results suggest that pre - existing memory @xmath0 t cells may be particularly beneficial for certain groups of people . for example , if the memory @xmath0 t cell number induced by viral infection or vaccination is assumed to be relatively constant for everyone , people with less naive @xmath0 t cells would benefit more upon viral re - infection ( see fig .  8a ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if assuming pre - existing memory @xmath0 t cell number is positively correlated with the number of naive @xmath0 t cells ( simulated in fig .",
    "8b ) , people with more naive @xmath0 t cells would benefit more upon viral re - infection .",
    "emerging evidence suggests that the relationship between the level of memory @xmath0 t cells and naive precursor frequencies is likely to be deeply complicated @xcite . in that context ,",
    "our model predictions emphasize the importance for further research in this area , and the necessity to take prior population immunity into consideration when designing @xmath0 t cell vaccines @xcite .",
    "we modeled both short - lived and long - lived antibody responses .",
    "experimental data and model predictions consistently show that the short - lived antibody response results in a temporary reduction in virus level whereas the long - lived antibody response is responsible for complete viral clearance ( fig .",
    "we emphasize here that although the model is able to capture the observed short - lived and long - lived antibody responses ( in order to study the virus - immune response interactions ) , it is not designed to investigate the mechanisms inducing different antibody responses .",
    "the observed difference in antibody decay profile may be a result of many factors including the life times of different antibody - secreting cell types @xcite , different antibody life times @xcite and antibody consumption through neutralizing free virions .",
    "detailed study of these phenomena requires a more detailed model and associated data for parameter estimation and model validation , and is thus left for future work .",
    "similarly , @xmath81 t cells are also known to perform a variety of functions in the development of immunity , such as facilitation of the formation and optimal recall of @xmath0 t cells or even direct killing of infected cells during viral infection @xcite .",
    "their depletion due to , say , hiv infection has also been associated with more severe clinical outcomes following influenza infection @xcite .",
    "some of the major functions of @xmath81 t cells may be considered to be implicitly modeled through relevant parameters such as the rate of recall of memory @xmath0 t cells ( modeled by the delay @xmath82 ) in our extended model which includes memory @xmath0 t cells .",
    "however , a detailed viral dynamics study of the role of @xmath81 t cells in influenza infection , including in hiv infected patients with depleted @xmath81 t cells , remains an open and important challenge .    in a recent theoretical study",
    ", it was found that spatial heterogeneity in the t cell distribution may influence viral clearance @xcite .",
    "resident @xmath0 t cells in the lungs have a more direct and significant effect on timely viral clearance than do naive and memory pools resident in lymph nodes .",
    "although this factor has been partially taken into consideration in our model by introducing a delay for naive / memory @xmath0 t cells , lack of explicit modeling of the spatial dynamics limits a direct application of our model to investigate these spatial effects .    finally , as noted in the results , one of the influenza a(h7n9)-infected patients ( patient a79 )",
    "was not included in our analysis of the clinical data ( fig .",
    "although our model suggests some possibilities for the source of variation due to possible variation in parameter values , large variations in recovery time are only expected to occur for relatively low levels of naive @xmath0 t cells , nominally incompatible with this patient s moderate @xmath0 t cell response but a relatively long recovery time .",
    "however , we note that @xmath83 t cell counts for this patient were only collected at days 10 and 23 , and that the count at day 10 was particularly low and much lower than that at day 23 ( see _ dataset s1 _ ) .",
    "we suspect that delayed , rather than weakened , production ( to at least day 10 ) of the @xmath83 t cell response in this patient substantially contributed to the observed delay in recovery .",
    "further investigation of this patient s clinical course and clinical samples is currently being undertaken .",

    "we emphasize that , although the default parameter set is successful in reproducing a multitude of experimental observations ( e.g. full immune , knockout , re - infection ) as presented in the main text , we by no means claim that this parameter set is unique .",
