    "the lack of lorentz invariance leads to a number of unusual electrodynamic properties , such as splitting of the dispersion relation of electromagnetic waves,@xcite and a possibility of superluminal ( faster than the slowest electromagnetic wave velocity ) fluxon motion , accompanied by cherenkov - like radiation .",

    "it is seen that variation of junction resistances strongly suppresses high - frequency resonances.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    our simulations demonstrate that superluminal resonances @xmath192 can be excited by subluminal flux - flow @xmath39 , which is in agreement with experimental data reported above .",
    "although such possibility was not discussed before , it is probably not surprising because qualitatively the same happens with out - of - phase resonances .",
    "the necessary condition is given by eq .",
    "( [ mres ] ) , which clearly allows excitation of superluminal modes @xmath193 at @xmath39 .",
    "for example , in the considered case @xmath112 , the first fastest @xmath194 mode can be excited at @xmath195 , provided @xmath196 .",
    "the quality factor @xmath197 is an important characteristic of the resonance . here , @xmath198 is the effective damping resistance and @xmath199 the capacitance of the junction .",
    "high - quality geometrical resonances are crucial for realization of coherent ffos:@xcite    a.   they amplify the emission power @xmath200 .",
    "this is especially important for stacked ffos since there is no lorentz contraction of the fluxon at the velocity matching condition,@xcite which is used for amplification of the electric field in a single junction ffo.@xcite",
    "b.   they reduce the radiation linewidth of the ffo @xmath201 .",
    "c.   they may impose their order on the fluxon lattice even at subluminal flux - flow velocities , as follows from numerical simulations in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](a ) .",
    "in particular , in - phase resonances may stabilize the rectangular fluxon lattice , facilitating coherent amplification of radiation @xmath202 .",
    "the forced transformation of the fluxon lattice occurs when the resonant standing wave electric field @xmath203 is larger than the fields of the fluxons .",
    "therefore , high @xmath204 is critical for such forced transformation .",
    "although numerical simulations presented above describe well the subluminal @xmath180 part of experimental flux - flow branches [ cf .",
    "[ fig : fig5](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ] , there is a clear discrepancy in the superluminal regime .",
    "numerical simulations@xcite predict very strong superluminal fiske steps , which have even larger amplitudes than the out - of - phase steps at @xmath205 , as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](b ) . in those simulations",
    "larger @xmath204 for higher fiske steps is simply the consequence of linear growth of @xmath206 for constant @xmath198 and @xmath199 . to clarify this discrepancy we consider the quality factors of different modes @xmath45 , @xmath207 here @xmath44 is the junction length",
    "there are two counteracting contributions . on the one hand , @xmath208 and",
    "should be larger for high speed and large @xmath60 modes .",
    "on the other hand , the effective resistance @xmath209 is decreasing with increasing frequency .",
    "for single josephson junctions it is very well established that at high frequencies @xmath209 is approaching the radiative resistance of the circuitry @xmath210@xcite due to predominance of radiative losses into outer - space .    as emphasized in ref .",
    "[ ] , in stacked junctions @xmath209 strongly depends on @xmath53 .",
    "out - of - phase modes interfere destructively , cancelling radiative losses .",
    "therefore , @xmath204 of those non - emitting modes is determined by the large qp resistance @xmath211 : @xmath212 taking parameters for our mesa  1 , @xmath213 , @xmath214 at @xmath92 , intrinsic capacitance @xmath215 , @xmath216 , @xmath217 , and @xmath218 we obtain @xmath219 .",
    "this very large value is consistent with the sharp , large amplitude @xmath220 steps seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](a ) .",
    "it is also consistent with observation of out - of - phase fiske steps in much longer junctions @xmath221.@xcite the same is true for other destructively interfering , non - radiative modes @xmath222.\\ ] ] for the in - phase mode electric fields from all junctions interfere constructively resulting in large coherent emission .",
    "in this case @xmath198 is determined by radiative losses , @xmath223 using parameters of mesa 1 , @xmath224 , and assuming @xmath225 we obtain @xmath226 .",
    "thus , radiative geometric resonances should have substantially smaller @xmath204 than the non - radiative ones.@xcite    for mesa  1 with @xmath112 all even-@xmath53 modes are non - radiative , eq .  ( [ mnonrad ] ) .",
    "fiske steps due to such resonances should have the highest @xmath204 and amplitude .",
    "this is consistent with our observation that even-@xmath53 modes correspond to the most prominent fiske steps , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "similarly , more smeared , high - voltage fiske steps at larger fields could indicate enhanced emission and radiative losses from the radiative superluminal resonances .",
    "the asymmetry between even and odd @xmath53 fiske steps is an indirect evidence for significant coherent radiation emission from the stack.@xcite      collective , high - voltage fiske steps can also be suppressed by another trivial reason : due to the spread in junction resistances @xmath227 . indeed , if junctions in the stack have slightly different qp resistances @xmath228 , the fiske step @xmath184 would occur at different currents @xmath229 .",
    "therefore , the collective fiske step could be observed only if the amplitude of the steps @xmath230 .",
    "apparently , this condition is more difficult to satisfy for high voltage and low @xmath204 resonances .    to demonstrate this , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](c ) we present numerical simulations for nonuniform damping @xmath231 , increasing by @xmath174 per ijj from the top to the bottom of the mesa and with the corresponding spread in the qp resistances @xmath232 .",
    "the rest of the parameters are similar to that in panels ( a ) and ( b ) . from comparison with panel ( b )",
    "it is clear that the amplitude of low frequency out - of - phase @xmath18 steps @xmath233 mv is unchanged , but all high frequency superluminal resonances are strongly reduced .",
    "the fastest in - phase resonances are practically nonexisting .",
    "we emphasize that in the considered case this is not due to radiative losses , but is caused by the trivial reason that junctions can not be synchronized because it is impossible to keep them at the same voltage for a given current .",
    "note that the spread in @xmath234 is not preventing the synchronization and is , therefore , much less detrimental for resonances , as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](b ) . in practice",
    ", both low @xmath204 due to radiative losses@xcite and enhanced sensitivity to resistance spread may explain the abundance of the highest speed fiske steps in experiment .",

    "small number of ijjs in the mesa allowed accurate identification of different resonant modes .",
    "different resonance modes , including superluminal with velocities larger than the lowest velocity of electromagnetic waves @xmath18 , were observed .",
