    "after the first hints@xcite , the trucations theorems were proven at the level of primaries ( for half integer spins ) in ref.@xcite , the final complete proof being given in a recent paper of ours@xcite . in ref.@xcite , and in the present article ,",
    "we analyse further the physics of these theories and begin solving the topological models proposed in ref.@xcite , where gravity is in the strong coupling regime .    in the strong coupling regime ,",
    "the screening charges are complex , so that the dimensions of primaries are not real in general .",
    "these truncation theorems express the fact that , nevertheless , at the special values of @xmath4 the operator algebra of the chiral intertwinors  that appear as chiral components of the powers of the liouville exponentials  has a consistent restriction to verma modules with real virasoro highest weights .",
    "thus one is led to consider that strongly coupled two dimensional gravity should be expressible entirely in terms of the corresponding chiral components .",
    "this brings in drastic changes with respect to the weakly coupled regime .",
    "it rules out the liouville exponentials , which are the well known local fields of the present description of 2d gravity in the conformal gauge , both classically and at the weakly coupled quantum level@xcite .",
    "however , a new set of local fields may be constructed , which is consistent with the truncation theorems .",
    "then the corresponding physics follows quite naturally , using methods very similar to the weak coupling ones .",
    "in ref.@xcite we emphasized that the transition from weak to strong coupling may be characterized by a deconfinement of chirality .",
    "indeed , in the weak coupling regime , the liouville exponentials may be consistently restricted to the sector where left and right chiral components have the same virasoro weight , so that we may say that chirality ( of gravity ) is confined . in this regime",
    ", the quantum numbers associated with each screening charge may take independent values . in the strong coupling regime , on the contrary , the reality condition forces us to link the quantum numbers associated with the two screening charges , for each chirality .",
    "this is however incompatible with the equality between left and right weights , so that the ( gravity ) chirality fluctuates : it is deconfined . the main motivation to study",
    "the strongly coupled regime is of course the building of the ( so called ) non critical strings .",
    "indeed , the balance of central charges prevents us from doing so in the weak coupling regime .",
    "the actual construction is still too complicated beyond the three point functions , but we have set up@xcite models  which we call topological since their only degrees of freedom are zero modes  where gravity is strongly coupled .",
    "we shall present details about their solution which were left out from ref.@xcite .",
    "the article is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we derive the string susceptibility , drawing a parallel with the weak coupling calculation . in section 3 ,",
    "we study the three point functions of our topological models .",
    "it was derived earlier@xcite only with the same screening choice for the three legs , but we need to treat the mixed case .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the derivation of the n point function from the ward identities generated by taking derivatives with respect to the strong - coupling cosmological constant .",
    "using mathematica , we derive irreducible irreducible vertices , up to six legs , which give a consistent perturbation theory up to sixth order .",
    "this is similar to earlier studies in the weak coupling regime@xcite but we let the screening number fluctuate , contrary to this reference . consistency of the perturbative expansion of the topological models leads us to counting rules for its relation with the feynman path integrals , which could not be guessed a priori .",
    "however , at the end we verify that the same rules also hold in the weak coupling regime , if the screening numbers are allowed to fluctate . as a matter of fact",
    ", the two types of topological models ( i.e. the continuous version of matrix models , and our new ones ) are found to be very similar technically , although gravity and matter quantum numbers are entangled completely differently .",
    "to begin with , we review the derivation in the weak coupling regime , following essentially ref.@xcite . we shall provide details left out previously which will shed light on the strong coupling case .",
    "in particular , it will be useful to draw a close parallel with the ddk argument . with our notations , the latter follows from the following effective action , with cosmological constant @xmath5 , background metric @xmath6 : @xmath7",

    "one only uses the fact that the dependence upon this parameter in eq.[1.4 ] is entirely contained  by definition  in the last term of @xmath167 . in the strong coupling regime another cosmological term ( @xmath168 ) appears , and it is reasonable to assume that the higher point functions will be determined from the associated ward identities . in this case , however , the vertex operators create and destroy gravity chirality , so that the effective action can not be constructed out of an ordinary world sheet boson .",
    "it should rather involve two independent chiral bosons with opposite chiralities .",
    "we leave its derivation for further studies , since its explicit form does not matter so much at present .",
    "we only assume that this theory can be described by an effective action including the new cosmological term : s__c = s_0+_c 0 , 0 , [ ns ] where the action @xmath169 does not depend on the cosmological constant @xmath5 .",
    "so , we consider n - point correlators e^-s__c , -_1 - 1 , j_2,_2 , ... j_n,_n , = _ _ c where the integral sign stands for the functional integration and the integration over the position of the @xmath106 insertion points .",

    "derivation with respect to the cosmological constant of these @xmath106 point functions gives @xmath170 point functions with one external momentum put to zero : _",
    "_ c = _ _ c [ der1 ] .",
    "if this model can indeed be described by such an effective action , its perturbative expansion must yield feynman rules .",
    "we already computed the three point vertices previously and we represent it graphically with an outgoing momentum for the leg @xmath171 : _ _ c = j_1 , _ 1 , j_2 , _ 2 , j_3 , _ 3 ,   _ c^p_1+p_2 + p_3 -s+24 = [ f3p2b ] with j , , = 1 , j , , = 1 , from previous sections .",

    "p__c(j_i,_i)= p_i = [ prop ] . on the other hand , by taking derivatives , one gets higher order correlators .",
    "the derivatives of the three point functions yields four point functions with one external moment put to zero .",
    "however , the @xmath106-point functions should be symmetric in their @xmath106 legs when expressed in terms of the variables we are using .",
    "( this is true for @xmath174 ) and we get by symmetrisation the generic four - point function @xmath175 ( q_m4 - 1 ) [ f4p1 ] if we believe in this effective action description , it must yield feynman rules by perturbative expansion .",
    "this total four point function [ f4p1 ] can therefore be obtained from the following diagrams [ f4ps ] the last one being the one particule irreducible amplitude .",
    "it is clear on this example that , by choosing one incoming and @xmath176 outgoing momenta , we have consistently restricted ourselves to feynman rules which only involve one particle irreducible vertices of the same type .",
    "our purpose here is to get those one particule irreducible vertices , which are the basic ingredients of the theory . to do this",
    ", we shall substract from the total four point function [ f4p1 ] the first three diagrams of [ f4ps ] which we shall compute from the previous feynman rules ( the propagator [ prop ] and the vertices [ f3p2b ] with their selection rules integer ... ] ) .",
    "let us figure out what shall give such a computation . in a diagram of the type [ f4p1d ] , and in any diagram",
    ", it can easily be verified that the leg factors coming from the propagators and the ones coming from the vertices cancel out . there",
    "only remains the leg factors attached to the external legs and we will consequently stop writing them down as the general dependency in @xmath177 is now well known . ] .",
    "so , the value of such a diagram is essentially given by the momentum @xmath178 given in [ pi ] coming from the propagator [ prop ] for @xmath179 .",
    "we can then easily imagine that the sum of three such diagrams ( see [ f4ps ] ) can give something not very different from the total four point function [ f4p1 ] , and hence by difference a quite simple four point one particule irreducible function .",
    "however , it does not work this way .",
    "due to the screening charges , or equivalently to the selection rules of the three point functions , the momentum is not conserved . in terms of spins , it means that in the previous diagram one can have @xmath180 and @xmath181 where @xmath182 and @xmath183 are the number of screening charges attached to the second vertex ( right hand side ) .",
    "these numbers can be any positive integers provided they do not exceed the total number of screening charges @xmath184 ( this stems from the selection rules for the first vertex ) . and",
    "so , the only consistent way to proceed is to sum over all the possible internal momenta or spins ( @xmath185 ) .",

    "2=0^__2=0^ [ _-(j_3+j_4-+12 ) + _+(_3+_4-+12 ) ] [ calcfeyn ] .",
    "we notice that these selection rules give arithmetic progressions for the spins @xmath186 and @xmath187 and that the propagator is linear in these spins .",
    "it is hence clear that such a sum shall yield an overall ( combinatorial ) factor equal to the number of terms in it ( @xmath188 in this case ) .",
    "it can be verified on each case . as a consequence",
    "the summation of the first three diagrams of [ f4ps ] over their possible internal momenta will not give something close to the value of the total four point function [ f4p1 ] , as they include this extra combinatorial factor .",
    "we then conclude that the right value of the total four point function should include this factor .",
    "we consequently define the physical @xmath106 point amplitudes by @xmath189 = ( ^+n-3_n-3 ) ( ^+n-3_n-3 ) .",
    "[ aphys ] the combinatorial factors of the type @xmath190 are the number of ways of placing @xmath191 screening charges on the @xmath192 vertices of a @xmath106 point function the expression @xmath193 .",

    "it is remarquable that it may be expressed as a number of choices of @xmath196 ( or @xmath191 ) objects among @xmath197 , however we have no interpretation of it by now . ] .",
    "of course , this modifies the derivation rule [ der1 ] in the following way : @xmath198 = ( + n-2n-2 ) ( + n-2n-2 ) ^ a^(n ) _ ( , ) ( ( j_1,_1 ) , ( j_2,_2 ) ...",

    "substracting from this total four point function the first three reducible diagrams of [ f4ps ] , which are given by sums of the type [ calcfeyn ] , one gets the one particle irreducible correlator @xmath200 = ( + 1)(+1 ) 14 ( -(2+s ) + q_m2(_-+_+ ) ) [ f4pirr ] which does not depend on the momenta .",
    "it works similarly for the higher order correlators , with a very quickly growing complexity however .",
    "first of all , every diagram gets more complicated : instead of the double sum [ calcfeyn ] the @xmath106 point diagrams may include @xmath201 nested sums .",
    "then , the number of diagrams go from 4 diagrams with 2 different skeletons for the four point function ( cf [ f4ps ] ) to 26 diagrams of 5 different ( oriented ) skeletons incoming legs ( @xmath202 ) .",
    "the exchange with the outgoing leg @xmath203 gives a different oriented skeleton and leads to different computations because of the different selection rules and directions of internal arrows ( first and second diagrams of [ f5ptop ] for instance ) .",
    "] for the five point function , that we represent here : , [ f5ptop ] to 236 diagrams with 12 different oriented skeletons at six points , 2752 diagrams with 34 skeletons at seven points ... the five point function seems already almost out of reach of human computationnal capabilities .",
    "this is why we used a computer and the `` mathematica '' program for symbolic calculation .",
    "we defined an oriented diagram as a tree of which root is the outgoing momentum .",
    "we generated all of them recursively , keeping only one diagram with each different skeleton in order to speed up computation .",
    "each of them was then computed recursively , the result being given by multiple sums .",
    "they could be computed thanks to appropriate rules for simplification and computation of sums .",
    "and we eventually obtained all the diagrams by symmetrising each diagram with a given skeleton .",
    "we were able to do that up to the six point functions , which already required some hours of cpu time .",
    "the one particule irreducible five and six point correlators were then obtained by difference between the total correlators and these reducible diagrams .",
    "we got for the five point function : @xmath204 = ( ^+2_2 ) ( ^+2_2 ) ( b^(5 ) ( , ) - _ i=1 ^ 5 ( p_i ) ^2 ) [ f5pirr ] where @xmath205 is the following polynomial of degree 2 in @xmath206 @xmath207 - 5____3 - 5____3 -11 ^ 2 _ _",

    "the polynomials @xmath216 and @xmath217 are rather complicated and by now we have no interpretation of them .",
    "on the other hand , the way these irreducible correlation functions depend on the momenta is particularly interesting .",
    "first , they are symmetric in all of their legs , including the outgoing one , which is not the case of the reducible diagram .",
    "second , they are symmetric under the exchange of @xmath218 into @xmath219 ( or equivalently @xmath220 into @xmath221 ) , as we only have even powers of the momenta ( 0 or 2 ) .",
    "this is necessary to have a really symmetric correlator as one leg is outgoing ( this was not true for the total correlators , see [ f4p2 ] e.g. ) .",
    "this feature was already noticed in the weak coupling regime@xcite , where higher order correlators where computed at @xmath222 in the case without screening charges ( for matter ) .",
    "it was obtained there that the irreducible @xmath106 point functions only depend on momenta at even power @xmath223 int@xmath224 , which is similar to the present results in the strong coupling regime in the case with screenings .",
    "this symmetry of the irreducible correlation functions seems to be a good check of consistency of this description by an effective action .",
    "we draw a parallel with the case of weak coupling in order to show that many things in the previous derivation are not specific to the strong coupling regime . similarly , we use two copies of the construction of the weak coupling regime , one for matter and the other for gravity , and get the dressed operators already introduced in eqs.[vertexdef],[vcdef ] .",
    "one knows from the so - called seiberg bound that this second type of dressing is to be chosen only for negative momenta of matter , and this is why we reverse the spins in the `` conj '' operators .",
    "this was discussed in details in ref.@xcite , and it was shown there that the integral representations give non vanishing results only for one negative momentum , the others being positive .",
    "we shall simply follow this guide here and not go through the whole discussion as our main purpose is simply to show that many aspects of the previous derivations were not specific of the strong coupling regime .",
    "so we only consider ( at least in a first step ) correlators of the type _ _ c .",
    "their scaling law was computed in eq.[1.5 ] and may be rewritten _ _ c ~_c^_i _ i -(n2 - 1 ) ( 1 + h ) [ mudepw ] with _",
    "i = - ( j_i+12 ) + ( _ i + 12 ) h = _ i _ - + 12 ( 1 + h ) = _ i _ - + q2_- [ qi ] .",
    "the three point functions are obtained from previous computations and are equal to one , up to ( different ) leg factors : @xmath225 = j_1 , _ 1 , j_2 , _ 2 , j_3 , _ 3 , _ c^_1+_2 + _ 3 -12 ( 1+h ) [ f3p2bw ] with j , , = 1f(1 + 2j+ ) , j , , = 1f(1 + 2+j ) . from the particular three point function with one momentum put to zero , one deduces the two point function by integration .",
    "the propagator is given by its inverse and is again given by the moment : p__c(j_i,_i)= _ i = [ propw ] where from now on we omit the leg factors and the @xmath5 dependence .",
    "all these derivations seem really similar to the ones performed in the case of strong coupling . and",
    "it is actually possible to show that , up to some correpondance , all the diagrammatic computations are equivalent .",
    "although the underlying physics is completely different the following correspondence    ccc j_i,_i , & & j_i,_i , + j_i,_i , & & j_i,_i , + j_i & & j_i + _ i & & _ i + p_i & & _ i + q_m_-/4 & & -1 + q_m_+/4 & & /h=_-^2/2    [ corresp ] relates both diagramatics .",
    "this can easily be checked for the dependence in @xmath5 ( eqs.[mudep3 ] and [ mudepw ] respectively . ] ) , for the momenta ( eqs.[pi ] and [ qi ] ) , for the three point function ( eqs.[f3p2b ] and [ f3p2bw ] respectively ) , and for the propagators ( eqs.[prop ] and [ propw ] ) .",
    "consequently the higher order correlators and diagrams obtained either by derivation or from these feynman rules obey the same correspondence .",
