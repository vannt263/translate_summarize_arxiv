    "recently carbon nanotubes(cnts )  @xcite have attracted much attention from various points of view .",
    "especially their unique mechanical , electrical , chemical properties have stimulated many people s interest in the analysis of cnts  @xcite .",
    "they have exceptional strength and stability , and they can exhibit either metallic or semiconducting properties depending on the diameter and helicity  @xcite . because of their small size , properties of cnts should be governed by the law of quantum mechanics .",
    "therefore it is quite important to understand the quantum behavior of electrons in cnts .",
    "however in low energy region ( @xmath0 $ ] ) , we do not have to examine all electrons in the system but low energy excitations near the fermi level .",
    "low energy excitations at half filling move along the tubule axis because the circumference degree of freedom ( an excitation in the compactified direction ) is frozen by a wide energy gap ( @xmath1 $ ] ) .",
    "hence this system can be described as a 1 + 1 dimensional system .",
    "furthermore in the case of metallic cnts , the system describing small fluctuations around the fermi points is equivalent to the two components  massless \" fermions in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "this allows us to analyze the low energy excitations with sufficient accuracy by means of technique in quantum field theory .",
    "quantum mechanical behavior of the  massless \" fermions in metallic cnts is governed by many kinds of interactions . among others",
    "the coulomb interaction is the most important interaction and drives the system into a strongly correlated system .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate how the coulomb interaction plays the role when the system is perturbed .",
    "particularly we try to answer the following basic question :  what is happening when we put an external charge on a metallic carbon nanotube ?",
    "\" the external charge which we consider in this paper is externally fixed spinless particle .",
    "this is thought to be a charged impurity in a metallic nanotube  @xcite . to answer the above question we investigate the charging energy and charge screening effect  @xcite .",
    "this paper is composed as follows .",
    "a model hamiltonian for low energy excitations in metallic nanotubes is constructed in sec.[sec : hamiltonian ] . in sec.[sec : quantization ] , we rewrite the kinetic hamiltonian in terms of current operators . then we examine the hamiltonian including the long - range coulomb interaction and analyze some effects of the coulomb interaction on charging energy and charge screening effect in sec.[sec : coulomb ] . in sec.[sec : gate ] we consider the gate - electron interaction to show the effect of the long - range coulomb interaction against an external perturbation .",
    "conclusion and discussion are given in sec.[sec : discussion ] .",
    "an another type of the coulomb potential is considered in app.[app:2 ] .",

    "low energy excitations in metallic carbon nanotubes consist of four independent fermion fields .",
    "their quanta are spin up(@xmath2 ) and down(@xmath3 ) electrons in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 fermi points .",
    "we denote these fields as , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a label for the four fermions and these fermions are expressed by @xmath8 respectively .",
    "for example , the field @xmath9 expresses the spin up electron field in the @xmath4 fermi point .",
    "hereafter we use @xmath10 as an element of the set : @xmath11 as in eq.([eq:4fermions ] ) .",
    "each fermion field consist of two components spinor that we name them @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this two components structure is due to the specific lattice structure of the graphite sheet  @xcite .",
    "the subscripts l and r denote left - handed component and right - handed component respectively .",
    "the left and right are defined by the eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the @xmath16-component of the pauli spin matrix .",
    "time evolution of these fields is governed by the complicated hamiltonian in realistic circumstances .",
    "for example , tubes are not strict straight line but generally bend  @xcite and the end of a tube(cap ) might mix the wave - functions of different fermi points  @xcite .",
    "we restrict our attention to the most basic and important interactions : kinetic interaction , one - dimensional long - range coulomb interaction and gate - electron interaction with a simple boundary condition .",
    "the kinetic term is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the momentum in the tubule axis direction(@xmath19",
    "\\equiv d$ ] ) and @xmath20 is the fermi velocity .",
    "it is remarkable that the dispersion relation is linear due to the special band structure of the @xmath21 electrons in the graphite sheet .",
    "therefore we call these fermions  massless \" fermions",

    "when we write the coulomb interaction without the cutoff , it has an ultraviolet divergence in the limit of @xmath29 . to avoid the divergence",
    ", we need to introduce a cutoff .",
    "it is appropriate to set it the diameter of a tube because when two electrons on a nanotube come from opposite sides of the tubule axis direction , they repeal and pass each other . at the moment they approach most",
    ", there is still a distance about the diameter of a nanotube to decrease the energy of such event .",
    "this is an origin of the cutoff .",
    "similar kind of cutoff  @xcite in the coulomb potential is derived from integrating out the circumference degree of the coulomb interaction .",
    "both potentials have the same behavior at long distance scale @xmath30 .",
    "however there is a significant difference at short distance scale @xmath31 .",
    "some detailed discussions about this potential are given in app .",

    "it should be noted that the gate voltage is not usually equivalent to a voltage of the gate itself because of the capacitance of a substrate .",
    "we may consider the position dependent gate voltage @xmath34 as a model for an electrical contact or as an external perturbation to a nanotube .",
    "response of the system against a local gate voltage is investigated in sec.[sec : gate ] . by comparing the system including the long - range coulomb interaction with the one excluding the interaction ,",
    "we show how the long - range coulomb interaction changes the response to the local gate voltage .",

    "it is possible to construct the fermion fock space by acting bosonic creation operators which are bi - linear of the fermion operators on the vacuum .",

    "this charge measures the left - right asymmetry of the vacuum and is defined by the difference of the left charge and the right charge on the vacuum . note",

    "the one - dimensional long - range coulomb interaction in metallic nanotubes is given by the following potential form @xmath76 where @xmath24 is the diameter of a nanotube and this is the traces of the pseudo one - dimensional nature of carbon nanotubes .",
    "total hamiltonian of this system consists of the kinetic hamiltonian and the coulomb interaction .",
    "the kinetic hamiltonian is written in terms of the current operators as is shown in the previous section .",
    "the coulomb interaction can also be rewritten in terms of the current operators because total charge density in the coulomb interaction is a sum of the left and right current operators , @xmath77 hence , by replacing @xmath25 by eq.([eq : j ] ) in the coulomb interaction([eq:1dmycoulomb ] ) , we obtain @xmath78 we have introduced the fourier components of the coulomb potential , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the circumference ( @xmath81 ) of a nanotube .",

    "the plots in fig.[fig : screen - gate ] show that the long - range coulomb interaction between internal electrons significantly changes the response of the system to the external perturbation .",
    "the effect of the coulomb interaction on the induced charge density appears in the denominator of the above result .",

    "the solid line is given by the formula([eq : induced - gate ] ) and the dashed line is given by the same formula however without the coulomb interaction(@xmath198 ) .",
    "we set @xmath199 for a metallic nanotube with @xmath200 $ ] and @xmath201 $ ] . ]",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the charge screening effect in metallic carbon nanotubes .",
    "the significance of our present work is put as follows .",
    "we modeled the hamiltonian([eq : hamiltonian ] ) describing the low energy excitations in metallic nanotubes and solved the system in the presence of the external charge .",
    "it was found that when we put an external particle on a metallic nanotube , the electric charge of the particle is screened by internal electrons due to the long - range coulomb interaction between the particle and internal electrons .",
    "the coulomb interaction is strong as compared with the energy scale of the kinetic hamiltonian([eq : ratio ] ) .",
    "this fact makes the quantum mechanical screening complete .",
    "the screening length is given by about the diameter of a nanotube in regard to the long - range coulomb potential([eq:1dmycoulomb ] ) .",
    "however the length depends on the cutoff in the potential of the coulomb interaction(see app.[app:2 ] ) , therefore it is important to understand the short distance behavior of the potential to find more accurate value of the screening length .",
    "this is a nontrivial problem because the short distance corresponds to the high energy region , hence we necessarily examine other bands in addition to the linear bands . anyway",
    "the effective range of screening(about the diameter of a nanotube or less than that ) is very small compared with the length of a nanotube , the end of a nanotube(cap ) can be thought to be ineffective to the screening phenomena .",
    "the formula for the induced charge density in the presence of a point particle is given by eq.([eq : final - delta ] ) .",
    "the summention of @xmath202 in this equation converges due to eq.([eq : ratio ] ) . because of that an extra cutoff of @xmath202 is not necessary  @xcite . in substance",
    "the summention converges up to @xmath203 .",
    "however , the high frequency modes@xmath204 of the long - range coulomb interaction might be influenced by the other bands which do not belong to the ` massless ' dispersion bands .",
    "we would like to make a quantitative analysis of these massive bands in a future report .",
    "we may use an another kind of the long - range coulomb potential which is derived from integrating out the circumference degree of the coulomb interaction with a cutoff @xmath205  @xcite . the interaction is given by , @xmath206 with the potential , @xmath207 @xmath208 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind and the cutoff @xmath209 denotes the average distance between a @xmath210 electron and the nucleus .",
    "it should be noted that a new length scale @xmath205 in addition to @xmath38(length of a nanotube ) and @xmath24(diameter ) is coming out .",
    "this scale modifies the behavior of the potential at short distance(@xmath211 ) as is shown in fig.[fig : potential ] .",
    "hence fourier components of the potential , @xmath213 are different from the previous one @xmath214 .",
    "we plot the induced charge density using eq.([app : fourier ] ) in fig.[fig : induced - egger ] .",
    "it can be seen that the screening length is about one half the length of the diameter .",
    "it is important to note that the effective range of @xmath202 summention in the formula of the induced charge density becomes large compared with the coulomb interaction in the text . within this plot",
    ", the summention converges up to @xmath215 .",
    "so , it is not clear if the screening effect can be recognized in the framework of the  low energy \" excitations . in order to answer such question",
    ", we introduce a regulator to examine if the high frequency modes of the potential give a significant contribution to the final result  @xcite . here",
    "we take a simple regulator , @xmath216 + 1 } , \\label{eq : reg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath217 .",
    "we define the following induced charge density , @xmath218 this function is also shown in fig.[fig : induced - egger ] .",
    "we see from this figure that the induced charge density oscillates .",
    "this is due to the regulator and does not have any physical meaning .",
    "what needs to be emphasized at this point is that the screening effect arises from the contribution of the low energy region @xmath219 .",
    "thus it is concluded that the charge screening can be analyzed in the low energy physics .",
    "let us consider nanotubes which have different diameter .",
    "fig.[fig : d - depened - egger - screen - delta ] shows the induced charge distribution for nanotubes with @xmath181 $ ] by means of the coulomb potential ( [ eq : coulomb2 ] ) .",
    "here we suppose that these nanotubes have the same length @xmath220 $ ] . it should be noted that the screening length is proportional to the diameter of a nanotube .",
    "however as compared with the previous potential case ( fig.[fig : d - depened - screen - delta ] ) the diameter dependence is rather week .    ) with @xmath172 .",
    "the solid line is given by the formula for the four fermions case([eq : final - delta ] ) , the dashed line is for the one fermion case([eq:1fermion ] ) .",
    "the dotted - dashed line shows the function in eq.([eq : cutoff ] ) that is regularized by the function([eq : reg ] ) with @xmath221 .",
    "we use the fourier components@xmath222 and take @xmath223[ ] , @xmath170 $ ] and @xmath46 $ ] in these plots . ]    .",
    "the solid line is for @xmath183 $ ] metallic nanotube , the dashed line is for @xmath184 $ ] case and the dashed - dotted line is for @xmath185 $ ] .",
    "we use the fourier components@xmath222 and take @xmath223[ ] and @xmath224 $ ] in these plots . ]      here we derive the final results eq.([eq : finalcharging ] ) and eq.([eq : finalinduce ] ) , using the operator decomposition into spin and charge .",
    "first we consider the density operator for @xmath225 fermi point .",
    "we define the following operators for the @xmath225 point @xmath226 where we omit spatial dependence of these operator for simplicity and @xmath227 express the charge and spin operators of left handed fermions in the @xmath225 fermi point . similarly for the right - handed sector at @xmath225 fermi point",
    ", we define @xmath228 the commutation relations between these operators can be calculated by using the commutation relation of original operators(@xmath229 ) .",
    "for example , we obtain the following commutation relation @xmath230 = 2 \\frac{i}{2\\pi } \\partial_x \\delta ( x - y).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath231 fermi point , similarly we define @xmath232 using above definitions of the density operators , we define the symmetric and antisymmetric combination concerning two fermi points using the above spin and charge operators for left - handed sector as follows : @xmath233 similarly for right - handed sector , @xmath234 we get the following kinetic hamiltonian in term of these new density operators @xmath235   \\nonumber \\\\ * & & +   \\delta \\left [   \\frac{l}{8 } \\int_d : j_{l , c_-}(x)^2 + j_{r , c_-}(x)^2 : dx - \\frac{1}{12 }   \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ * & & +   \\delta \\left [   \\frac{l}{8 } \\int_d : j_{l , s_+}(x)^2 + j_{r , s_+}(x)^2 : dx - \\frac{1}{12 }   \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ * & & +   \\delta \\left [   \\frac{l}{8 } \\int_d : j_{l , s_-}(x)^2 + j_{r , s_-}(x)^2 : dx - \\frac{1}{12 }   \\right ] . \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us define the following operator and this is actually equivalent to the charge density operator , @xmath236 therefore we find that the total charge sector is decouple from other operators and this is famous spin and charge separation in one dimensional systems . the coulomb interaction is written only by the total charge density . hence we combine the kinetic term and the long - range coulomb term and define @xmath237 sector as follows : @xmath238   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{e^2}{8\\pi } \\int \\!\\!\\ ! \\int_d",

    "the current operators is defined by the same way in the previous section @xmath239 notice that the commutation relation is modified @xmath240 = 4\\frac{i}{2\\pi } \\partial_x \\delta(x - y),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and we obtain the current algebra @xmath241 =   4n \\delta_{nm } , \\\\ & & \\left [ j_{r , c_+}^n , ( j_{r , c_+}^m)^\\dagger \\right ] =   4n \\delta_{nm}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] analysis of the above hamiltonian can be done like one fermion case .",
