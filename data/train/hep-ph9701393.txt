    "the violation of baryon number ( b ) in the hot , symmetric phase of electroweak theory plays a crucial role in scenarios for electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "the rate of b violation is tied , through the electroweak anomaly , to the the rate of topological transitions of the electroweak gauge fields . for the symmetric phase , this rate is not calculable by any perturbative method . in this paper ,",
    "i address whether the topological transition rate can , in principle , be extracted from lattice simulations .",
    "the discussion will reveal some surprising features of real - time thermal field theory on the lattice .",
    "it has long been appreciated that , at finite temperature , topological transitions in real time are not directly related to topological transitions in euclidean time @xcite . as a result , there is no apparent way to measure the real - time thermal transition rate in a standard , euclidean - time , lattice simulation of quantum field theory .",
    "several years ago , ambjrn and krasnitz @xcite cleverly implemented the observation @xcite that a full simulation of _ quantum _ field theory is not actually required .",
    "topological transitions occur in the symmetric phase through large configurations which are essentially classical .",
    "indeed , _ all _ long - distance bosonic physics in a hot , ultrarelativistic plasma is effectively classical because of bose enhancement .",
    "the number of quanta per mode in low - energy modes is given by the bose distribution @xmath2 and , by the correspondence principle , this is the classical regime . unlike quantum field theory ,",
    "real - time simulations of classical field theory are tractable : just evolve the classical equations of motion .",
    "classical thermal field theory has an ultraviolet catastrophe , historically famous in the context of black - body radiation . because every mode has energy @xmath3 by the classical equipartition theorem , and because there are an infinite number of modes per unit volume in continuum field theory",
    ", the energy density is infinite . in quantum field theory ,",
    "in contrast , the ultraviolet contribution is cut off at momenta of order @xmath4 .",
    "ambjrn and krasnitz reasoned that the details of short - distance physics should not affect the long - distance physics of topological transitions . in their simulations , they put their classical system on a spatial lattice and then evolved it in continuous real time .",
    "the ultraviolet catastrophe was cut off by the lattice spacing , which they progressively made smaller and smaller .",
    "son , yaffe , and i @xcite have recently pointed out that short - distance effects do not decouple as cleanly as ambjrn and krasnitz hoped . in particular , the short - distance modes cause damping of the long - distance dynamics , and this damping affects the transition rate .",
    "we showed that damping reduces the transition rate by a factor of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the weak fine structure constant . because the damping is caused by short - distance physics",
    ", it is not universal , and so a comparison of theories with different short - distance physics becomes non - trivial . in the classical lattice theory used by ambjrn and krasnitz , for example",
    ", damping reduces the rate instead by a factor of @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the lattice spacing .",
    "as i shall discuss , there is an even more serious problem : because damping is dominated by short - distance physics , it knows about the anisotropies of the lattice . as we shall see explicitly , and as was first noted by bodeker _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , the effective long - distance physics of the classical lattice theory is not even rotationally invariant .",
    "this is in striking contrast to the familiar situation of euclidean - time simulations , where rotational invariance is always recovered in the continuum limit .",
    "i shall assume that our analysis of damping in ref .",
    "@xcite is correct and will eventually be borne out by numerical simulations at sufficiently weak coupling . in this paper ,",
    "i focus on the natural follow - up question : given that the real quantum theory and the classical lattice theory have different long - distance physics , is there any way to measure the real topological transition rate ?",
    "the answer is yes  in principle  but an exact calculation requires a careful choice of lattice action and the numerical extraction of a somewhat awkward limit .",
    "but i shall also propose a rough numerical measure of the suitability of generic lattice actions and argue that even results from simple , canonical actions should be in the right ballpark if properly interpreted .",
    "i shall not address at all the complicated problem of how one measures topological transitions on the lattice in the first place , which has a long , difficult history for euclidean - time quantum simulations and a shorter but still confusing one for real - time classical simulations .",
    "i simply focus on dynamics and assume the measurement problem will eventually be solved , using cooling or some other technique .",
    "section 2 of this paper outlines my method for taking a measurement of the topological transition rate in a theory with one ultraviolet cut - off ( _ e.g. _  a classical spatial lattice theory ) and using it to predict the rate in the same theory with a different ultraviolet cut - off ( _ e.g. _ the real , continuum , quantum field theory ) .",
    "the procedure will require , however , that the long - distance dynamics be rotationally invariant in both cases , and this poses a problem for the lattice that will eventually be dealt with .",
    "section 2 rests on a very rough and schematic discussion of the effective long - distance dynamics , and i return in section 3 to do a better job of reviewing the correct long - distance theory .",
    "i review the derivation of `` hard thermal loop '' effective theory but add a small twist .",
    "the usual discussions in the literature are based on the assumption that hard ( _ i.e. _  high - momentum ) excitations in the plasma move at the speed of light .",
    "this is not true for lattice theories , and i show how the usual results easily generalize . in section 4 , as a warm - up example of a rotational - invariant classical theory , i consider continuum classical thermal field theory with the ultraviolet regulated by higher - derivative interactions . in section 5 , i turn to the canonical definition of the classical theory on a simple cubic spatial lattice . by explicit computation ,",
    "the damping at long distances is shown to be anisotropic and to have an interesting structure of cusp and logarithmic singularities in its angular distribution .",
    "i discuss the origin of these singularities",
    ". then i argue that measurements of the topological transition rate in simple lattice theories can still ( if properly interpreted ) be used to estimate the real transition rate , and i propose a rough measure of the systematic error arising from the anisotropy of the lattice . in section 6 ,",
    "i propose that the real transition rate could in principle be measured arbitrarily well from lattice simulations by implementing a lattice version of the higher - derivative continuum theory discussed in section 4 . in section 7 , i briefly discuss some possibilities of alternative lattice theories that may be more rotational - invariant than the canonical one , yet easier to implement than my proposal of section 6 . section 8 explores two quantities important to thermal field theory but slightly tangential to the main thrust of this paper : the plasma frequency and the debye mass .",
    "i compute both for classical , thermal gauge theory on the lattice .",
    "the results provide one test of whether lattice simulations of a given size are indeed in the small coupling limit , and i comment on the application of this test to the simulations of ref .",
    "section 9 offers my conclusions and a summary of what remains to be done .",
    "the origin of the basic scales associated with topological transitions is reviewed in the introduction of ref .",
    "@xcite , and i shall simply quote here the standard result : topological transitions proceed through non - perturbative gauge configurations of spatial size @xmath9 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we then showed that the time scale associated with such transitions is @xmath10 and that the transition occurs through slowly varying magnetic configurations .",
    "( more technically , the relevant , low - frequency gauge fields are transversally rather than longitudinally polarized . )",
    "my current endeavor can be summarized as follows .",
    "consider the effective long - distance and long - time theory corresponding to frequencies and spatial momenta of order @xmath11 .",
    "what is the correspondence of those theories between ( a ) the real quantum theory , and ( b ) a cut - off classical theory ?    the important characteristics of the long - distance effective theory for topological transitions , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , can be roughly introduced as follows : the behavior of the long - distance modes is analogous to a pendulum moving in hot molasses , where the molasses represents the short - distance modes , and non - perturbative physics such as the topological transition rate corresponds to large - amplitude fluctuations of the pendulum .",
    "a slightly non - linear pendulum is described by an equation of the form @xmath12 a pendulum in ( idealized ) hot molasses is described instead by a langevin equation of the form @xmath13 there is a damping term with coefficient @xmath14 due to the viscous interaction with the molasses .",
    "there is also a random force @xmath15 due to the buffeting of the pendulum by random thermal fluctuations of the molasses .",
    "the two are related by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "ignoring the non - linearity of the pendulum , the random force in ( [ eq : pendulum ] ) must have a white - noise spectrum with normalization @xmath16 : @xmath17 the frequency response of such a pendulum is @xmath18 with a power spectrum @xmath19 which includes small - amplitude , high - frequency fluctuations and larger - amplitude , low - frequency ones .",
    "if the pendulum is strongly damped , @xmath20 , then the characteristic inverse time for the largest amplitude fluctuations is @xmath21 in this case , the @xmath22 term is ignorable in ( [ eq : response ] ) , and the large - amplitude fluctuations of the system can be described by replacing ( [ eq : pendulum ] ) with the simpler equation @xmath23    in the case of gauge theory , the damping coefficient with the plasmon damping rate : they refer to different kinematic regimes . @xmath14 describes the damping of nearly - static magnetic fields in the plasma , for which @xmath24 and @xmath25 is @xmath26 . in this case",
    ", @xmath25 is dominated by hard contributions .",
    "the plasmon damping rate , on the other hand , describes the damping of propagating plasma waves , for which @xmath27 and @xmath25 is @xmath28 . in this case , the dominant contribution to @xmath25 depends on soft as well as hard physics . ]",
    "@xmath14 is determined from the imaginary part of the ( retarded ) thermal self - energy @xmath29 .",
    "the effective equation of the long - distance modes is , in frequency and momentum space , @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "the dominant contribution to @xmath32 for @xmath33 is well - known @xcite and is generated by interactions with short - distance ( momenta @xmath34 ) degrees of freedom . in the frequency region of interest ( @xmath35 ) , and for transverse ( _ i.e. _  magnetic ) fluctuations , it is given in weak coupling by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the ( leading order ) debye mass . for the case of pure gauge theory , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the adjoint casimir and @xmath40 for su(@xmath41 ) .",
    "so , for each mode @xmath42 , the damping coefficient @xmath14 of ( [ eq : pendulum ] ) is just @xmath43    for the spatial momentum scale of topological fluctuations , @xmath44 , ( [ eq : omega ] ) confirms that @xmath45 and shows that the effective theory can be described by a simplified langevin equation of the form ( [ eq : pendulum simplified ] ) .",
    "so far , i have been very schematic .",
    "most significantly , i have blithely ignored all the terms in the above equations labeled `` higher order in @xmath46 . '' since i am ultimately interested in non - perturbative phenomena , i need to do a better job .",
    "i will review the full , unadulterated equations of motion of the effective theory in the next section .",
    "however , the schematic equations presented so far are adequate to explain the basic idea of how to compare theories with different ultraviolet behavior .    ignoring the higher - order terms altogether for now , consider two theories with different ultraviolet cut - offs  say , the real quantum theory and some cut - off classical theory .",
    "the self - energy @xmath32 will be different in the two theories , and so the damping constant @xmath14 will be different .",
    "the long - distance effective equations of motion are then also superficially different :    [ eq:2 eqs]@xmath47    but , as i ve written them , these two equations are trivially related by a rescaling of time : @xmath48 [ that this transformation maps @xmath49 can be verified from ( [ eq : noise 0 ] ) . ]",
    "that means that the topological transition rates @xmath50 of the two theories are related by a simple rescaling of time : @xmath51 the prescription for measuring the real topological rate is then : ( a ) to measure it in some uv cut - off classical theory , ( b ) to perturbatively compute the self - energy and hence the values of @xmath14 in both the real theory and the classical theory , and then ( c ) to convert the measured rate by ( [ eq : convert 1 ] ) .",
    "the fly in the ointment is that generically , in lattice theories , @xmath14 is not rotationally invariant but depends on the direction of @xmath42 with respect to the axis of the lattice .",
    "i shall demonstrate this later by explicit calculation .",
    "this means that there is no single rescaling of time that can relate the equations ( [ eq:2 eqs ] ) for all the long - distance modes of the theories .",
    "so there is another step required in the prescription : ( step 0 ) find a classical lattice theory where the ultraviolet cut - off is as rotationally invariant as possible .",
    "i should emphasize that , unlike the more familiar case of euclidean - time simulations , this last step is a theoretical necessity and not merely a numerical convenience . in euclidean simulations , improving the rotational invariance of the action improves the rate of approach to the continuum limit as the lattice spacing is decreased , but ( in principle ) any lattice action will do as long as the lattice spacing is small enough . here , that is not the case .    the chink in the armor of rotation invariance can already be seen in the result ( [ eq : pi ] ) for the self - energy in the real , rotational - invariant theory .",
    "in euclidean time , consider effective interactions of the long - distance degrees of freedom that are induced by the short - distance degrees of freedom .",
    "such interactions can be taylor expanded in the small , long - distance momenta @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "the cubic symmetry of the lattice is enough to guarantee that any interaction up to two derivatives @xmath55 is in fact rotationally invariant as well .",
    "interactions involving four derivatives need not be rotationally invariant , but such interactions are irrelevant and decouple from the long - distance physics .",
    "the crucial assumption of this argument is the analyticity of the interactions at @xmath56 .",
    "it has long been known that real - time thermal interactions generated by short - distance physics _ fail _ this analyticity criterion , as can be seen explicitly in ( [ eq : pi ] ) .",
    "the standard mechanism by which rotational invariance is recovered in euclidean time is therefore no longer operative .    before proceeding to flesh out the proposals made in this section , i should fix a point of nomenclature .",
    "often in this paper i shall refer to the `` real '' rate @xmath57 of topological transitions in continuum , quantum , pure non - abelian gauge theory at high temperature and weak coupling .",
    "if one s interest is in actual electroweak theory in the same limit , with its accompanying higgs and fermion fields , it is easy to convert if one ignores the small effects of the weinberg mixing angle .",
    "the debye mass in electroweak theory is @xcite @xmath58 for a single doublet higgs and @xmath59 families . by the conversion procedure ( [ eq :",
    "convert 1 ] ) outlined above and by ( [ eq : gamma 0 ] ) , the electroweak rate @xmath60 is related to the pure su(2 ) gauge theory rate `` @xmath57 '' by @xmath61 eq .",
    "( [ eq : ew ] ) and",
    "the analysis of this paper applies whenever the temperature is sufficiently high that the infrared dynamics of the higgs is irrelevant at lengths of @xmath62 .",
    "this is the case either ( 1 ) far above the electroweak phase transition or crossover , or ( 2 ) in the symmetric phase at the transition in cases where there is a 1st - order transition and the transition is not exceedingly weak .",
    "other cases could be handled by including the infrared dynamics of the higgs into the discussion and into simulations .",
    "it is now well - established how to write a set of non - local equations describing the dominant interactions of long - distance modes in hot , real - time , non - abelian gauge theory when the random force term @xmath63 discussed earlier is ignored .",
    "these interactions go by the name of `` hard thermal loops , '' since they are generated by integrating out the hard , short - distance modes of the theory .",
    "though there is a great deal of literature on this subject , it is almost universally geared to hard particles that travel at the speed of light . in a lattice theory ,",
    "in contrast , the hard particles have a more complicated dispersion relationship than @xmath64 .",
    "it will therefore be useful to briefly review the derivation of the hard thermal loop equations so that i can motivate the ( simple ) modifications required for applying them to lattice theories .",
    "hard thermal loops were originally derived through diagrammatic analysis by braaten and pisarski . for my purpose ,",
    "the quickest way to get at them is by an alternate method formalized by blaizot and iancu @xcite , which i shall present heuristically .",
    "( see also ref .",
    "the method is a generalization of the description of qed plasmas via vlasov equations .",
    "the vlasov equations are an effective description where soft photons are represented by gauge fields @xmath65 in the usual way , but all the hard , charged particles are represented by a locally defined flow density @xmath66 , which is the density of particles at time @xmath67 and position @xmath68 with ( hard ) momentum @xmath69 .",

    "( rather than a simple color - diagonal number operator , @xmath82 now represents a correlation between the colors that the gauge bosons convert between . )",

    "the final result ( [ eq : basic 1 ] ) of the previous section is in fact sufficient for the comparison of different theories , but , for the sake of completeness , i will review the random force term as well .",
    "the vlasov equations of the previous section describe the relaxation or propagation of deviations from equilibrium ; they do not , as formulated above , describe the fluctuations that occur in equilibrium itself .",
    "however , fluctuations are related to dissipation through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . introduce a random force term by writing @xmath114 if we momentarily ignore the non - linearity of ( [ eq : basic ] ) , which arises from the non - abelian nature of the theory , then the characteristics of the random force can be taken from ( [ eq : noise 0 ] ) : @xmath115 where @xmath8 and @xmath116 are adjoint color indices .",
