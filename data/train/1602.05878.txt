    "the theoretical @xcite@xcite and experimental @xcite discoveries of quantum spin hall effect in 2d followed by its extension to the idea of topological insulators in 3d @xcite have become one of the most exciting developments in condensed matter physics in the @xmath3 century @xcite.topological insulators ( tis ) are characterized by novel response properties the most striking of which is an electromagnetic response called magnetoelectric ( tme ) effect in 3d topological insulators , where an applied magnetic field @xmath4 induces electric ( charge ) polarization @xmath5 ( or applied electric field @xmath6 induces magnetization @xmath7).in topological field theory @xcite , this effect is derived from the effective action @xmath8 known as axion electrodynamics @xcite , giving rise to magnetoelectric response @xmath9.axion term also leads to witten effect where a unit magnetic monopole binds a generally fractional electric charge in a medium with @xmath10 , as also studied in topological insulator context @xcite.the @xmath11 is the pseudoscalar axion field ; odd under parity and also odd under time reversal.for static time - reversal invariant systems , @xmath12 or @xmath13 , corresponding to ordinary and topological insulators respectively.when time reversal symmetry is broken , @xmath14 .",
    "when the system is dynamical @xcite , the @xmath11 becomes a time - dependent function , which we will later denote by @xmath15 .",
    "we will study this dynamical case and focus on @xmath16 response .    to study this magnetoelectric response of 3d topological insulators",
    ", we will consider fu - kane - mele ( fkm ) model of 3d ti @xcite given by    @xmath17    where @xmath18",
    "are the sites of 3d diamond lattice , @xmath19 is the electron creation ( annihilation ) operator at site @xmath20 , @xmath21 the hopping integral , @xmath22 the spin - orbit coupling strength , @xmath23 the cubic unit cell size , @xmath24 the pauli spin matrix vector , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are two consecutive nearest - neighbor vectors connecting two second - neighbor sites.the 3d topological insulators are characterized by a set of four @xmath27 topological invariants @xmath28 @xcite@xcite.the phase diagram of fkm model of 3d tis contains weak topological insulator ( wti ) phase ( @xmath29 , essentially equivalent to ordinary insulator ) which is not robust to weak perturbation and disorder and strong topological insulator ( sti ) phase ( @xmath30 ) , which is robust to weak perturbation and disorder.a number of materials have been predicted to be 3d stis , such as @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 under axial strain @xcite.the topological phase transition between the two phases is normally marked by a gap closing point @xcite.however , the gap itself can not be used as an ` order parameter ' of the transition as the gap is nonzero in both ordinary and topological insulating phases of 3d tis.this is what motivates our work here where we consider dynamical axion response of 3d tis and obtain as our main results ; 1)tme effect can be described in linear response theory with a vector potential involving axion field.2)correlation function of topological current is used to define a dynamical current susceptibility which in its static limit surprisingly gives an ` order parameter ' of the topological phase transition.3)the ( real part of ) dynamical current susceptibility shows a sign - changing singularity whose strength is suppressed in the topological insulating state.the latter two results provide the signatures of the topological phase transition in 3d tis .",
    "most of the existing studies on the electromagnetic response in solids employed the abstract berry phase formalism @xcite@xcite@xcite.in this paper , we employ current density formalism @xcite@xcite which is more physically motivated as it works directly with such measurable quantities as current.we study the response of a charged particle system to electromagnetic fields described by 4-vector potential @xmath34.we focus on the case with an applied magnetic field and choose a gauge where @xmath35@xcite.the hamiltonian is given by @xmath36 where we use a non - relativistic fermion system of mass @xmath37 and charge @xmath38 as an example , giving rise to charge current operator @xmath39 @xmath40\\ ] ] @xmath41 the first and the second terms are known as the paramagnetic current @xmath42 and the diamagnetic @xmath42 current , respectively ; @xmath43.such decomposition also works for relativistic fermion systems @xcite@xcite . in 3d tis , the applied magnetic field",

    "we find the expression for @xmath50 by solving the field equations derived from the lagrangian involving the axion term.in the presence of axion term mentioned in the beginning , rewritten as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the coupling constant , and @xmath15 is the generally time - dependent axion field added to the standard maxwellian electrodynamics described by @xmath53 , the field equations are modified and are given as @xcite@xcite @xmath54 @xmath55 we note the presence of extra terms in the form of additional charge density in eq.([mae1 ] ) and current density in eq.([mae2 ] ) due to the axion field @xmath15.considering a situation with no free charge density ( @xmath56 ) and no free current density ( @xmath44 ) _ within _ a periodic solid subjected to an _ external _ spatially uniform magnetic field @xmath4 , we found that the axion field @xmath15 @xcite generates an electric field @xmath6 given by @xmath57 this electric field then induces polarization @xmath5 in the solid , manifesting the tme effect .",
    "since the axion field @xmath15 is time - dependent , the resulting electric field @xmath6 and polarization @xmath5 are also time-dependent.as a result , one obtains a charge current following from @xmath58.dynamical axion ensures the presence of a charge current even when the magnetic field is static.this current further modifies the vector potential @xmath50.we found that the vector potential @xmath50 for a general time - dependent uniform magnetic field becomes @xcite @xmath59 @xmath60 we note that @xmath50 now acquires a new term in addition to the standard @xmath61 ; the axion term @xmath62 , which is proportional to the applied uniform magnetic field @xmath4 , implying that the polarization @xmath5 acquires a component along the direction of @xmath4 , according to eqs.([p - j ] ) and ( [ current]).this is the topological polarization of the tme effect .",
    "we now consider inversion - symmetric fu - kane - mele model of 3d tis @xcite for concreteness , where the maxwellian @xmath63 term generates no polarization @xcite , so that we can focus on the topological part of @xmath50 of interest.considering general space - time dependent axion field @xmath64 and treating the paramagnetic and diamagnetic parts on equal footing @xcite , we obtain the following equation for the topological induced current , @xmath65 @xmath66\\ ] ] where the paramagnetic and diamagnetic contributions take parallel form.we seek to characterize the response of topological insulators in terms of this quantity .",

    "the result eq.([totaldyncurrsuscept ] ) suggests that we can adopt @xmath2 to study the response of 3d tis and its dependence on the frequency and microscopic parameters of @xmath77 , especially the hopping integral , as we tune the system across its topological phase transition.this @xmath2 can be used as a dynamical characterization of the tme effect of 3d ti in response to a uniform magnetic field applied along an appropriate direction.the response will be dominated by the diagonal elements of @xmath2 because in tme effect @xmath5 is collinear with @xmath4.we will explicitly compute @xmath78 as example .",

    "we show the profile for @xmath78 in the static limit @xmath98 corresponding to static susceptibility in fig.1 , demonstrating its variation as function of the deformation @xmath99 of hopping integral @xmath100 along two different directions ; @xmath101 $ ] and @xmath102 $ ] directions , each separately and simultaneously.the deformation of hopping integral can be accomplished by appropriate chemical doping which creates point defects of the type vacancies or substitutional defects in the semiconductors @xcite.the topological phase diagram obtained in fu - kane - mele s seminal work @xcite suggests that one has wti ( reducible to ordinary insulator ) for @xmath103 , sti ( true topological insulator ) for @xmath104 , and quantum critical point semimetal at @xmath105 for deformation along [ 111 ] while keeping @xmath105 along @xmath102 $ ] and vice versa , as well as when the hopping integral is deformed along the two directions simultaneously .",

    "this critical behavior of @xmath107 is nontrivial because naively , the susceptibility should only depend on the projection of the direction of electron hopping to the direction of applied magnetic field and thus should not depend on how the deformation of the hopping integral is implemented , given the two fixed directions.this turns out to hold only if the solid is always in the same phase relevant to its current response , e.g. weak topological ( equivalent to ordinary ) insulating phase.now the current susceptibility shows such unexpected behavior as one crosses a topological phase transition , even if the two directions of hopping deformation are fixed .",
    "@xmath107 thus can serve as an ` order parameter ' for this topological phase transition which fig.1 suggests to be continuous , in agreement with experiments @xcite.this is also consistent with the expectation for a phase transition obtained by continuously tuning a parameter in a non - interacting fermion model eq.([3dtifkmmodel]).the computed static orbital polarizability also agrees with the result of berry phase theories @xcite .",
    "theoretically , this nontrivial behavior originates from the @xmath115 symmetry of the band structure of the fkm model eq.([3dtifkmmodel ] ) under @xmath13 rotation about the @xmath116 axis preserved under simultaneous deformation of the hopping integrals with equal strength along @xmath101 $ ] and @xmath102 $ ] directions , but broken when the deformation is applied separately in one of the two directions.this @xmath115 symmetry manifests its @xmath27 effect @xmath117 in the current susceptibility for ( strong ) topological insulator since the surface fermi arc encloses odd number of dirac points ( @xmath30 ) while the effect vanishes in the weak topological ( ordinary ) insulator since the arc encloses even number of them ( @xmath29)@xcite.we have checked and confirmed numerically that such a critical behavior in @xmath118 would never occur if we set the spin - orbit coupling to zero for example , where only one type of insulator ; ordinary insulator ( at any @xmath119 ) could exist @xcite .",
    "we now present the outcome for the dynamical response function @xmath78 in the ordinary and topological insulator phases as well as at the quantum critical point between them in fig.2.apart from the numerical fluctuations due to the finite - size effect around some critical frequencies , the profile of @xmath78 is consistent with the familiar @xmath120 behavior of the two - body ( e.g.density-density , current - current ) response functions that have a sign - changing singularity at a critical frequency @xmath121 at which the functions flip sign.using eq.([totaldyncurrsuscept ] ) and noting the magnitude of @xmath98 from figs.1 and 2 , it is clear that the singularity and the sign change also occur to the @xmath122 measurable in experiment.the ordinary and topological insulator phases can be distinguished by the overall strength of the singularity around @xmath121.in general , we find that topological insulating phase leads to suppression of the strength of singularity in the dynamical response function at around @xmath121.the switch from negative to positive correlation across @xmath121 is nontrivial but can be nicely explained in terms of the continuity equation obeyed by the charge density and the current induced by the polarization generated by the magnetic field via the tme effect @xcite .",

    "this consistency further corroborates our identification of the dynamical current susceptibility @xmath79 as a characterization of the tme effect and the order parameter @xmath107 as an order parameter of the topological phase transition in 3d topological insulators .",
    "the experiment that we propose in the main text can be illustrated as in fig.4 . a thick slab sample of 3d ti candidate material is coated on each of its surfaces with a layer of ferromagnet with magnetization @xmath7 perpendicular to the interface @xcite , whose dynamical spin wave ( magnon ) provides the dynamical axion field @xmath15 that couples to the electric field @xmath6 induced by a generally time - dependent spatially uniform magnetic field @xmath4 applied parallel to the front and rear surfaces , which are normal to @xmath101 $ ] or @xmath102 $ ] direction .",
    "this magnetization is also needed to obtain the time reversal symmetry breaking in analogy to the effect of magnetic field in quantum hall effect , in order to observe the tme effect @xcite .",
    "consider a static magnetic field first . then there will be a polarization parallel to the magnetic field and which induces a charge density of opposite signs at the bottom and top ends of the sample . since the axion field is dynamical ,",
    "this polarization is readily time - dependent and gives rise to a current , following from @xmath58 and a time - dependent charge density according to continuity equation @xmath196 .",
    "applying time - dependent magnetic field gives rise to additional current which together with the charge density always satisfies the continuity equation . in this setup ,",
    "the current will be uniformly distributed over the front and rear surfaces ( assuming edge effect is negligible ) so that point contact measurement is equivalent anywhere on the surface , corresponding therefore directly to the space - averaged value of the quantity of interest .",
    "now suppose that the current is slowly increasing on the front surface , then the charge density on the bottom front as a result is decreasing .",
    "but charge conservation demands that the current on the rear surface should be decreasing and the charge density at the rear bottom end be slowly increasing , for slow enough time variation of the current .",
    "this implies that the currents on the front and rear surfaces are anticorrelated at small frequencies .",
    "this is in complete agreement with our explicit calculations represented in fig . 1 and fig . 2 where the current cross - correlation is negative at dc and low frequencies @xmath197 .",
    "at larger than critical frequencies , the currents on the two surfaces are positively correlated and there will be flow of charge from inside the bulk to supply for charge accumulation or depletion at the top and bottom ends of the sample .",
    "this is easy to understand if we note that in the energy band dispersion in @xmath83 space , low frequency photons only excite surface state electrons or states near fermi energy whereas high frequency photons excite electrons deep within bulk bands .",
    "the explanation for why the strength of sign - changing singularity is weaker in the ( strong ) topological insulating than in the weak topological ( or ordinary ) insulating phase is more curious but intuitively it relates to the surface state .",
    "in general , the presence of surface state facilitates the flow of charge and helps the electromagnetic field to excite low energy electrons near fermi energy .",
    "since the surface state of sti encloses an odd number of dirac points and so has at least one such dirac point , the transition from negative to positive current correlation is smoother as it is facilitated by the surface state , compared to a wti or ordinary insulator , which has no surface state or has surface state that encloses an even number of dirac points ( the effect of which may cancel out each other ) , the photons work by themselves in exciting the electrons without extra assistance from the surface state and this results in more dramatic sudden change from the negative to positive current correlation across the critical frequency @xmath121 .",
