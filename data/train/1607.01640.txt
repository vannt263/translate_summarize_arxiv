    "one of the most remarkable characteristics of organic semiconductors is long spin coherence times , which makes these materials suitable for various applications in spintronics @xcite and magnetotransport devices .",
    "@xcite the reason behind this valuable property is that the light elements as hydrogen and carbon , from which organic semiconductors are composed , have very weak spin - orbit interaction .",
    "for the same reason , the hyperfine coupling between the charge carrier and hydrogen nuclear spins is often the dominant source of the carrier spin scattering , @xcite and the resulting spin relaxation .    due to the inherently present disorder ,",
    "charge transport in organic semiconductors occurs via incoherent diffusive random walk over the charge carrying molecules or @xmath2-conjugated segments of polymers . during the waiting time between two consecutive hops",
    "the carrier spin and the local hydrogen nuclear spins couple by a hyperfine interaction .",
    "existing theories of hyperfine - induced spin relaxation and more general spin - dependent phenomena in organic semiconductors approximate the hyperfine interaction by locally random static magnetic fields , acting on the carrier spin . @xcite this provides a semiclassical approximation to the quantum spin dynamics .",
    "the distribution of random magnetic fields is taken to be gaussian .",
    "the hyperfine interaction strength is then controlled by the mean square deviation of the gaussian distribution , @xmath3 .",
    "experimentally established values of @xmath3 are of order of few mt .",
    "the semiclassical approximation neglects the action of the carrier spin on the local nuclear spin environment .",
    "thus it is good for relatively slow nuclear spin dynamics and fast carrier hopping .",
    "however , the semiclassical approximation may be inadequate if the carrier spends long times at the molecular sites , leading to sizeable changes in the local spin environments .",
    "this can happen , e.g. , if the carrier moves in effectively lower dimensions , so that its random walk trajectory undergoes multiple self - intersections . in the case of one - dimensional diffusive random walk of a total duration @xmath4 ,",
    "the average time spent by a carrier on a site on its trajectory is @xmath5 , and in @xmath6 dimensions this time is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the average waiting time , i.e. , the average time between consecutive hops .",
    "@xcite in both these cases the total time spent by the carrier at a site can become sufficiently long for the quantum dynamics of local spin environment to be important .    in this paper we investigate the effect of nuclear spin quantum dynamics on the spin relaxation in @xmath9 .",
    "we utilize numerical simulations based on a monte carlo sampling of random walk trajectories . to simulate the spin dynamics of small systems with up to @xmath10 total number of nuclear spins we employ the suzuki - trotter decomposition of evolution operator .",
    "@xcite for systems with larger number of nuclear spins we make use of the coherent - state @xmath0-representation approach for quantum central spin dynamics .",
    "@xcite    we study the time decay of average spin polarization of a carrier spin , @xmath11 , initially injected into an organic layer in the spin - up state [ @xmath12 .",
    "the spin polarization evolves as the carrier walks randomly over a linear chain of @xmath13 molecular sites , and its spin interacts with @xmath14 nuclear spins at each site .",
    "the decay of @xmath11 is controlled by the dimensionless combination , @xmath15 , @xcite which is the average precession angle of carrier spin between two consecutive hops ( we take @xmath16 and the electron gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath17 , making the magnetic fields and the larmor frequencies equivalent ) .",
    "we focus on small @xmath18 , characteristic for organic semiconductors featuring long spin coherence time .",
    "our calculations prove that the initial , dominant decay of spin polarization , down to about @xmath19 , is insensitive to the dynamics of nuclear spins and can be obtained very accurately from the semiclassical approximation .",
    "therefore the results of previous studies based on the semiclassical approach @xcite remain valid for the initial decay of @xmath11 .",
    "the effect of quantum dynamics of nuclear spins develops at longer times . for relatively small @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    ", we observe a plateau - like long - time behavior of @xmath11 , where its value is about @xmath20 , independently from @xmath21 .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the semiclassical behavior . for finite @xmath14 and @xmath22",
    "we find yet another unique long - time dependence , namely @xmath23 , where @xmath24 . on the other hand , for finite @xmath13 and increasing @xmath14 , the long - time polarization disappears and @xmath11 simply regains the semiclassical form .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the hyperfine interaction between the carrier and hydrogen nuclear spins , and its semiclassical description in terms of random static magnetic fields .",
    "our results on the spin relaxation by a quantum nuclear spin bath and their comparison with those of the semiclassical approximation are presented in sect .",
    "[ seccalcul ] .",
    "we discuss our results and provide explanations for the common features and differences of the quantum and semiclassical results in sec .",
    "[ secdiscuss ] .",
    "we consider a diffusive random walk of a carrier over a linear chain of @xmath13 molecular sites .",
    "accordingly , the sites are enumerated by the scalar coordinate , @xmath25 . at each molecular site",
    "@xmath26 , the carrier spin @xmath27 couples to @xmath28 nuclear spins @xmath29 by a hyperfine interaction .",
    "we will consider an isotropic hyperfine coupling , governed by the hamiltonian @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the external magnetic field along the @xmath32-axis , and @xmath33 are the hyperfine coupling constants .",
    "this description implies that the carrier - host molecular sties are identical , so that @xmath34 do not depend on @xmath26 .",
    "quite generally , theories of spin related phenomena in organic semiconductors approximate the quantum overhauser field , given by the sum in eq .",

    "( [ locham ] ) , the nuclear spin precession period scales as @xmath36 .",
    "@xcite therefore , for large @xmath14 one can neglect the slow dynamics and consider the nuclear spins being static . for large @xmath14",
    "it is also reasonable to approximate the distribution of @xmath37 by the gaussian with the standard deviation , @xmath38 .    while one expects that the approximation eq .",
    "( [ bi ] ) is good for increasingly large @xmath14 , its accuracy for finite @xmath14 is questionable . in organic materials",
    "@xmath39 is the expected number of hydrogen nuclei coupled to a carrier spin at a molecular site .",
    "@xcite with this large @xmath14 , the relaxation of a diffusing carrier spin can still be sensitive to the quantum dynamics of nuclear spins .",
    "in this section we calculate the spin relaxation of a carrier performing a diffusive random walk over a linear chain of @xmath13 sites . at each site",
    "the carrier spin couples to @xmath14 nuclear spins according to the hamiltonian ( [ locham ] ) .",
    "we assume that the random hops occur between the nearest neighbor sites with equal probability .",
    "accordingly , the random waiting times have the average , @xmath8 , uniform for all sites and the waiting time distribution at each site is poissonian , @xmath40 . for finite @xmath13 ,",
    "boundary conditions for the random walk should also be specified .",
    "however , simulations with periodic or reflective boundaries yield very close results , so that we present the ones with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "our calculation of the spin relaxation is based on the following simple consideration .",
    "a carrier , initially injected at @xmath41 in the spin - up state @xmath42 , diffusively moves over the available molecular sites and suffers spin flips .",
    "the system thus begins its evolution from the initial spin state , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the initial wavefunction of all @xmath45 nuclear spins .",
    "in the course of carrier random walk with the trajectory @xmath46 , the spin state of the system evolves according to the schrdinger equation , @xmath47 .",
    "its solution can be formally written in terms of the time - ordered exponent , @xmath48 by writing @xmath49 $ ] in the argument we emphasize that @xmath50)\\rangle$ ] is the spin wavevector after time @xmath4 , provided that the carrier underwent a random walk with the trajectory @xmath46 .",
    "the carrier spin polarization can be defined as @xmath51 with the bar standing for a triple average , where the first is the quantum mechanical average , the second is the average over the possible quantum states of the nuclear spin bath , and the third extends over different realizations of random walk trajectories .",

    ", there is a strong discrepancy between the quantum and semiclassical results at longer times .",
    "thus the true long - time behavior of @xmath11 is not captured by the semiclassical approximation ; while the latter predicts a vanishing spin polarization , the decay of @xmath11 shows a long - time plateau behavior , quenching at a small but finite value .    definitely , the quenching of @xmath11 at long times , seen in fig .",
    "[ quantsemi ] , is a consequence of the nuclear spin dynamics .",

    "we employ the @xmath0-representation method for quantum spin system simulation , proposed in ref .",
    "( see also ref . ) .",
    "the method is based on a monte carlo sampling of the density matrix in the spin coherent - sate basis , allowing an efficient modeling of large quantum systems with thousands of bath spins .",
    "it also allows to assess the spin dynamics at considerably longer times .    to check the accuracy of the @xmath0-representation method for the problem at hand , we compare its outcome for systems of up to @xmath10 nuclear spins with the results of exact simulation .",

    "in particular , we examine the long - time behavior of the spin relaxation in the regime of small @xmath18 , where the relaxation is slow .",
    "our @xmath0-representation simulations reinforce the previous conclusion that at long times the decay of @xmath11 is very slow , so that the spin polarization nearly quenches to a few percents of its original value .",

    "as we have shown above , the quantum dynamics of nuclear spins does not influence the initial relaxation of @xmath11 but shows up at long times , as a plateau for finite @xmath90 , or as a slow decay @xmath91 for @xmath22 .",
    "the fact that the initial decay of @xmath11 is not affected by the nuclear spin dynamics can be understood from the following reasoning . defining the cumulant expansion , @xmath92 $ ] , where @xmath93 , from eq .",
    "( [ trpav ] ) one can find the first non - vanishing cumulant , @xmath94 , to be @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the green function of the random walk over @xmath13 sites .",
    "equation ( [ k2 ] ) exactly coincides with the second cumulant function which can be found from the semiclassical approximation .",
    "@xcite this explains why the initial relaxation is insensitive to the quantum dynamics of nuclear spin , even in the ultra - quantum case @xmath89 .",
    "similarly to the semiclassical result , @xcite the approximation @xmath97 $ ] correctly describes the dominant spin relaxation , so that the spin relaxation time , @xmath98 , is set by @xmath99 and is insensitive to the nuclear spin dynamics . for large number of sites ( @xmath100 )",
    "the form @xmath101 $ ] with @xmath102 follows from the results of previous semiclassical treatments .",
    "@xcite    our findings for the long - time behavior of @xmath11 can be summarized in the formula , @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a constant .",
    "the combination in the brackets of eq .",
    "( [ tailvsln ] ) is approximately the inverse number of sites visited by the carrier .",
    "indeed , for small @xmath13 and @xmath105 , all the @xmath13 sites are visited equally many times and the inverse number of visited sites is @xmath106 . for @xmath22 , on the other hand , the average number of sites visited by the carrier is @xmath107 , and thus its inverse , @xmath108 .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ tailvsln ] ) is the inverse number of nuclear spins that couple to the carrier spin during a long - term diffusion .    to further elucidate this behavior we note that the hamiltonian ( [ locham ] ) conserves the @xmath32-component of the total spin",
    "therefore the initial carrier spin polarization does not average to zero but gets redistributed between the carrier and nuclear spins .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that for systems with smaller number of nuclear spins @xmath11 can be essentially non - zero for arbitrarily long times . however , the fact that this redistribution leads to a non - oscillatory , fixed or slowly changing @xmath11 at long times is highly nontrivial .",
    "moreover , the peculiar dependence eq .",
    "( [ tailvsln ] ) means that the polarization becomes evenly distributed between the carrier spin and nuclear spins which couple to the carrier spin in the course of diffusion .",
    "it is also remarkable that the amplitude of the tail is almost independent of @xmath21 , but is determined by @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this independence resembles the central spin problem ( @xmath82 , large @xmath14 ) , where the central spin polarization evolves into @xmath109 of its initial value regardless of the interaction strength , @xcite and relaxes from this value very slowly .",
    "@xcite    in conclusion , we have demonstrated that the quantum dynamics of nuclear spins leads to the long - time steady or slowly decreasing carrier spin polarization ; a feature which is not captured by the semiclassical approximation .",
    "the long - time behavior extends up to the times when other relaxation mechanisms become important ( e.g. , carrier spin - lattice relaxation times , or hydrogen nuclear spin dephasing times ) .",
    "the effect can be strong for carriers diffusing over fewer molecular sites , e.g. , in the situation realizing in tunnel magnetoresistance experiments in organic spin valves , at the onset of multiple - step tunneling .",
