    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most luminous explosions in the universe since the big bang .",
    "they fall into two ( partially overlapping ) populations according to their observed duration : @xmath1-ray durations ( measured as the time in which 90% of the fluence is emitted ) longer than 2  s are defined as long grbs ( lgrbs ) while bursts with duration shorter than 2  s are defined as short grbs ( sgrbs ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is widely accepted that at least the majority of lgrbs are driven by the collapse of massive stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , although some lgrbs may be generated by the merger of compact objects ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the strongest evidence for the collapsar scenario is the detection of bright ic sn component photometrically and spectroscopically associated with nearby lgrbs such as grb980425 , grb030329 , grb031203 , and xrf060218 ( @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", sgrbs may be powered by the merger of binary compact objects ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this connection is observationally bolstered by the association of some sgrbs with old stellar populations and lack of accompanying bright sn components in cases such as grb050509b ( @xcite ) , grb050709 ( @xcite ) and grb050724 ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , challenging this simple picture some sgrbs displayed violent x - ray flares occurring at least @xmath3 s after the triggers , e.g. , grb050709 ( @xcite ) and grb050724 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests long - lasting activity of the central engine and hence the current understanding of the grb progenitor mechanism may be too simple ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there is also evidence for activity of the inner engine on much longer time - scales ( several days ) for grb050709 ( @xcite ) and grb070707 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the whole picture became more complicated after the discovery of grb060505 and grb060614 , because both bursts are nearby lgrbs according to the conventional taxonomy but they are observationally not associated with sne down to very strict limits ( @xcite ) . in this sense , they share the expected observational properties of both conventional lgrbs and sgrbs .",
    "grb060505 had a fluence of @xmath4  erg  @xmath5 in the @xmath6  kev band , and a @xmath7 duration of @xmath8  s ( @xcite ) .",
    "it was found to be associated with a bright , star - forming region within its host galaxy at @xmath9 ( @xcite ) . in the compact - star merger scenario",
    "the diameter of the region and the location of the grb within it suggest that the delay time from birth to explosion of grb060505 was @xmath10 myr .",
    "this is marginally matching the lower limit of the delay - time region for sgrbs ( @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the age of the region of @xmath11 myr ( @xcite ) is consistent with the expectation for core - collapse in a massive star .",
    "the prompt emission of grb060614 consisted of a hard - spectrum component lasting @xmath12  s followed by a soft - spectrum component lasting @xmath3  s. @xcite reported a photon index @xmath13 for the time interval [ -2.83,-5.62 ] s since the bat trigger ( @xmath14 ) and @xmath15 for 5.62 - 97.0 s since the bat trigger ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the fluences in the two components are @xmath17  erg  @xmath5 and @xmath18  erg  @xmath5 in the 15 - 350 kev band , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "its host galaxy has a redshift of @xmath19 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the host of grb060614 is very faint with an absolute magnitude of about @xmath20 ( @xcite ) .",
    "its specific star - formation rate is quite low , but within the range covered by lgrb hosts ( similar , e.g. , to that of the grb050824 host galaxy , @xcite ) .",
    "the spectral lag has been invoked as a quantity that can be used to classify bursts such that sgrbs have zero lag and lgrbs fall on a well defined lag - luminosity relation @xcite . for grb060614 @xcite",
    "found that the spectral lags for the hard and soft components in the prompt @xmath1-ray emission are both consistent with zero lag , falling entirely within the range for sgrbs .",
    "for grb060505 , on the other hand , @xcite found using the _ suzaku_/wam and _ swift_/bat data that the spectral lag for the prompt @xmath1-ray emission is @xmath21  s , consistent with a lgrb identity .",
    "furthermore , lags of lgrbs and sgrbs , regardless of their physical origins , appear to overlap quite significantly according to statistics of 265 _ swift _ bursts ( see fig . 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , the so - called amati relation can be used to provide hints on which class grb060505 and grb060614 belong to . according to this relation derived from the observed grbs with sufficient data , all sgrbs are outliers because of their relatively higher @xmath22 peak energy , while all lgrbs , except the peculiar long grb980425 , are consistent with this relation .",
    "amati et al.(2007 ) find that grb060614 follows the relation whereas grb060505 does not .",
    "hence , based on properties of the prompt emission other than the duration it seems impossible to establish clear evidence about which class of bursts grb060505 and grb060614 belong to .    to gain further insight on this topic , in this work we add our own observational data to already published data and study the afterglows of grb060505 and grb060614 .",
    "we aim to determine from the afterglow properties whether these two bursts differ from other lgrbs , besides being sn - less , to provide further clues to the nature of their progenitors .",
    "the observations of the two afterglows and data reduction are presented in   2.1 and   2.2 .",
    "at the beginning of   3 , we briefly introduce the leading external shock wave model employed to explain grb afterglows , and apply it to grb060505 in   3.1 .",
    "grb060614 has been studied by @xcite ; in   3.2 and   3.3 we re -",
    "analyze this burst and provide analytical and numerical constraints on the afterglow parameters , respectively . in   4 we discuss possible progenitors of these two bursts in comparison with the recently discovered grb080503 , which we define as the first hard - spike @xmath0 hard - tail _ swift _ grb .",
    "throughout this paper we use the notation @xmath23 for the afterglow monochromatic flux as a function of time , where @xmath24 represents the observed frequency and @xmath25 is the energy index which is related to the photon index @xmath26 in the form of @xmath27 . the convention @xmath28 has been adopted in cgs .",
    "in addition , we consider a standard cosmology model with @xmath29 km s@xmath30 mpc@xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "the field of grb060505 was observed with the european southern observatory ( eso ) very large telescope ( vlt ) and the fors1 instrument on two epochs ( see also @xcite ) . on may 6.4 , slightly more than one day after the burst , the field was observed in the @xmath33 and @xmath34 bands . in order to be able to subtract the underlying host galaxy , in particular the hosting star - forming region within the host galaxy ( @xcite ) , the field was observed again on september 14.2 , again in the @xmath35 and @xmath34 bands .",
    "the journal of observations is given in table 1 .",
    "due to strong fringing and lack of calibration data we decided not to include the @xmath34 band data in the analysis .",
    "the optical data were corrected for bias and flat - fielded using standard techniques . in order to subtract the underlying emission from the host galaxy we used the isis software ( @xcite ) . in fig .",
    "[ image_subtraction ] we show the result of the image subtraction .",
    "as can be seen , the afterglow is clearly detected in all four bands .",
    "we then performed photometry on the afterglow in the following way .",
    "we first duplicated an isolated , non - saturated star in each of the the first epoch images to a new empty position such that it also appeared in the subtracted image .",
    "we then used daophot ( @xcite ) to perform relative photometry between the afterglow and the star .",
    "finally , we obtained the photometry on the standard system by measuring the magnitude of the comparison star using aperture photometry and the photometric zeropoints obtained based on landolt stars by the eso observatory calibration plan on the same night .",
    "swift_/xrt data were processed in a standard way using the _ swift _ software version 29 ( released 2008 june 29 as part of heasoft 6.5.1 ) .",

    "the @xmath36-band data by the watcher telescope were processed and made public for the first time , which not only are consistent with other @xmath36-band data but provide the accurate peak time , 0.3 days since the bat trigger , of the @xmath36-band afterglow lightcurve .",

    "we use the standard fireball afterglow theory reviewed by , e.g. , @xcite , with the simple microphysical assumptions of constant energy fractions imparted to the swept - up electrons , @xmath43 , and to the generated magnetic field , @xmath44 , respectively . for the evolution of the synchrotron spectrum",

    ", we follow the general treatment of @xcite and @xcite , that is , one first calculates the overall dynamical evolution of the grb outflow , and then calculates the synchrotron radiation at different times , including different corrections such as , e.g. , the equal - arrival - time - surface effect and the synchrotron - self - absorption effect .      to establish a broadband spectral energy distribution ( sed )",
    "we extrapolate the x - ray flux to the epoch of the optical data ( i.e. , 1.125 days after the burst ) .",
    "the optical data were corrected for foreground galactic extinction of @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "we fit the sed in count space ( see @xcite ) with an absorbed power law model , where galactic absorption in the x - rays is fixed at @xmath51 @xmath5 @xcite and intrinsic x - ray absorption and optical / uv extinction in the host galaxy are free parameters .",
    "solar metallicity is assumed in the x - ray absorption model , and extinction in the host is assumed to be smc - like @xcite .",

    "the fit has a @xmath56/dof of 5.3/4 .",
    "the index @xmath57 indicates that the cooling frequency @xmath58 is already below the optical at this time and the energy spectral index @xmath46 is slightly larger than 2 .",
    "indeed , the numerical fit , shown in fig .  [ 0505lc ] , yields @xmath59 , and other afterglow parameters are @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and the half - opening jet angle @xmath64 .",
    "these parameters are within the range of lgrb afterglows , but the limited data prevent us from getting more insight on the properties of this afterglow .",
    "both the sed measurement and the numerical fit tend to render it unnecessary to employ _ ad hoc _ models ( e.g. , macronova in @xcite ) to interpret this afterglow .",
    "we constructed afterglow seds in grb060614 at three epochs , i.e. , 0.187 days , 0.798 days , and 1.905 days .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ sedresults ] and shown in fig .",
    "[ grb060614sed ] .",
    "our seds are fully consistent with those in @xcite measured at 0.116 , 0.347 , 0.694 , and 1.736 days .",
    "both works show that there exists a spectral break between the optical and the x - ray before @xmath650.26 days while afterwards both the optical and the x - ray are in the same spectral segment with the spectral index @xmath66 .",
    "the afterglow lightcurves show that energy injection exists between @xmath67 and @xmath68 days , which presumably would change the sed during this period .",
    "if the injection frequency is between the optical and the x - ray , then it may lead to that the lightcurves have a very shallow rising in the optical band and a very shallow decay in the x - ray band .",
    "indeed , the observational data fit this interpretation very well ( @xcite ) .",
    "we found that this optical - to - xray lightcurve behavior still holds after performing different corrections .",
    "the result of our analysis shows that a flat or gradually increasing lightcurve is generally a description as good as a slow decaying except in the x - ray band .",
    "a temporal peak , clearly shown in optical bands , exists @xmath69 days after the burst .",
    "afterwards the afterglow decays with @xmath70 until @xmath71 days when it steepens significantly to @xmath72 .",
    "there is only one @xmath73-band upper limit before @xmath67 days , the starting time of energy injection .",
    "therefore , to constrain the afterglow properties we use data after @xmath68 days .",
    "the index @xmath74 after @xmath68 days indicates that the afterglow is in the slow cooling case of @xmath75 until at least a few days . using the afterglow closure relations we find @xmath76 , which gives the energy spectral index @xmath77 , which then gives the decay index @xmath78 , in good agreement with the observed decay law ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "furthermore , this @xmath46 value of @xmath79 is very close to the observed decay index of @xmath80 after @xmath81 days , in good agreement with the theoretically predicted decay law after a jet break , i.e. , @xmath82 at any wavelength from x - ray to optical .",
    "therefore , as discussed by @xcite , the break at @xmath83 days is likely the so - called _ jet break _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the optical decay is never faster than the x - ray decay , there is no indication of a wind - like circumburst medium for this afterglow . also since radio data are not available , analytical constraint on @xmath84 is impossible for this afterglow .",
    "using the earliest useful data , we put a lower limit on @xmath85 and an upper limit on @xmath86 as @xmath87 and @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath19 .",
    "using the latest useful data , we put the lower limit on @xmath58 as @xmath90 where @xmath91 . in detail , the above three equations give rise to the constraints @xmath92      we find that the afterglow data can be reasonably reproduced by the following parameters ( see fig .",
    "[ 0614lc ] for a plot of our fit ) : @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 erg , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 rad .",
    "the energy injection takes place at @xmath99  s and ends at @xmath100  s after the burst , and the energy injection is nearly a constant with a rate @xmath101 . substituting these parameters into equation ( 8) ,",
    "the numerical constraint is in agreement with the analytical constraint .",
    "if the energy injection is from the wind of a millisecond magnetar , to fit the observational data at the late stage of the whole energy injection period , the magnetar is required to have dipole radiation @xmath102^{-2}$ ] , where @xmath103 is the dipole magnetic field strength of the magnetar , @xmath104 is the radius of the magnetar , @xmath105 is the initial angular frequency of radiation , @xmath106  s is the initial spin - down timescale of the magnetar , and @xmath107 is the typical moment of inertia of the magnetar ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , because the optical flux is roughly proportional to @xmath108 , where @xmath108 is the sum of the isotropic - equivalent kinetic energy @xmath109 and the injected energy , then the predicted optical flux at the early stage of the energy injection period ( e.g. , @xmath110 days in fig .",
    "5 ) would be much higher than the observed flux . in detail , at @xmath111 day , there would be @xmath112 , indicating that the predicted optical flux should be @xmath653 times the observed flux .",
    "therefore the magnetar model is not convincing .",
    "note that the prompt @xmath113ray lightcurve may have two components : the earlier hard spike with an isotropic energy @xmath114 erg and the latter soft tail ( sometimes called extended emission ) with an isotropic energy @xmath115 erg .",
    "the early part is spectrally hard thus the outflow might be ultra - relativistic , while the latter part is spectrally soft suggesting the bulk lorentz factor of the outflow became lower .",
    "this is because the optically thin condition yields a lower limit on @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the total luminosity of the outflow , and @xmath118 is the typical variability timescale of the late soft @xmath113ray emission ( @xcite ) . in our numerical calculation",
    ", we find the bulk lorentz factor of the forward shock @xmath119 at @xmath120  s while @xmath121 at @xmath122  s. if the energy carried by the material of the late time grb ejecta satisfies the relation @xmath123 ( @xcite ) for @xmath124 , the constant energy injection form taken in the afterglow modeling can be reproduced ( @xcite ) . in this model , for the outflow accounting for the hard spike emission",
    "the energy efficiency is @xmath125 , while for the outflow accounting for the soft tail emission , the energy efficiency is @xmath126\\sim 8\\%$ ] .",
    "the decreasing efficiencies from early spike to late tail may be due to the smaller contrast between the lorentz factors of the fast material and that of the slow material .",
    "as shown in several early papers , for grb060505 ( @xcite ) and grb060614 ( @xcite ) there is no accompanying sn emission , down to limits hundreds of times fainter than the archetypical sn1998bw that accompanied grb980425 , and fainter than any type ic sn ever observed .",
    "multi - wavelength observations of the early afterglow exclude the possibility of significant dust obscuration .",
    "for grb060505 the properties of the host galaxy ( @xcite ) as well as the spectral lag of the prompt emission ( @xcite ) is most consistent with the properties expected for the long - duration class of grbs .",
    "for grb060614 the duration of the prompt emission places the burst firmly within the long - duration class of grbs , but the negligible spectral lag ( @xcite ) and the relatively modest star - formation activity of the host galaxy is more similar to the expected properties for the short - duration class of grbs . in this paper",
    "we have investigated whether or not the properties of the two afterglows could provide some hints to the most likely progenitor types for these bursts .    for grb060505 ,",
    "the numerical fit of its afterglow shows that the standard jetted external shock wave model is consistent with the data , yielding a typical interstellar medium density of @xmath127 , a wide jet angle @xmath128 , and a possible jet break at @xmath129 days . for grb060614 ,",
    "the standard external shock wave model is again consistent with the data , but apparently needing to invoke energy injection .",
    "the afterglow shows the clearest achromatic jet break among all bursts studied so far , decaying in a broken power - law from @xmath130 to @xmath131 at @xmath132 days .",
    "an achromatic peak , especially in the _ ubvr _ bands , occurs at @xmath133 days , which we interpret as resulting from an episode of strong energy injection as @xcite suggested .",
    "numerical fit yields a circumburst density of @xmath134 , being consistent with the inferred value in @xcite , and a jet angle of @xmath135 .",
    "the inferred afterglow parameters for the two bursts fall within the range for other lgrbs .",
    "if it had not been for the observed absence of associated sne we would have no reason , from the afterglow properties , to question their classification as lgrbs .",
    "after discovery of these two grbs , to reconcile all sn - observed and sn - less grbs within the conventional framework of short ( @xmath136 s ) and long ( @xmath137 s ) grbs , a new classification was proposed , in which grbs featuring a short - hard spike and a ( possible ) long - soft tail would be ascribed to the conventional short class , or type i in the new taxonomy , while all other grbs , or type ii , would comprise the conventional long class ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "the new classification expands the range of the conventional short class , and is applicable to grb060505 and grb060614 , which then would be sn - less due to a merger - related progenitor rather than sn - less massive stellar death .",
    "however , a recent burst , grb080503 , seems to challenge the new classification .",
    "this burst also has a temporal spike @xmath0 tail structure in the prompt emission phase .",
    "the @xmath138 values of the initial spike and the total emission in the 15 - 150 kev band are @xmath139  s and @xmath140  s , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fluence of the non - spike emission measured from 5  s to 140  s after the bat trigger in the 15 - 150 kev band is @xmath141 , being around 30 times that of the spike emission in the same band .",
    "this fluence ratio is much higher than the ratio of around 6 for grb060614 , and higher than any previous similar _ swift _ grb . for grb060614 and grb080503 we extracted the bat lightcurves in different energy bins , shown in fig .",
    "[ comparison ] , for comparison study . for grb080503",
    "we have analysed the spectral evolution during the prompt emission period by bat and xrt and list our analysis and that of other groups in table [ 080503 ] . from these",
    "we conclude that : ( 1 ) the results of different groups are fully consistent with each other .",
    "( 2 ) the photon indices for the spike and non - spike emissions are consistent within their error regions ( @xmath142 confidence level ) . a strong spectral softening from the spike phase to the non - spike phase",
    "can be excluded .",
    "a cutoff power - law fit does not improve the fitting , yielding the error of @xmath143 larger than 100% .",
    "( 3 ) during the bat - xrt overlap period , the xrt spectra are always harder than the bat spectra , which implies that the bat@xmath0xrt spectra ( 0.3 - 150 kev ) would be harder than the bat spectra ( 15 - 150 kev ) alone .",
    "this adds more evidence that from spike to non - spike the spectra did not soften considerably .",
    "in addition , note that for all conventional lgrbs ( e.g. , from batse ) , there is a general trend that the spectra during the prompt emission would soften mildly from the beginning time to the ending time ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the prompt spectral evolution of grb080503 is different from that of grb060614 .",
    "in addition , we computed the spectral lags in different energy bands using the 64 ms binning lightcurves , following the method in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the lag during the initial spike phase is consistent with zero . from 5 to 50",
    "s since bat trigger , the lags are @xmath144 s for the 25 - 50 kev vs. 15 - 25 kev band and @xmath145 s for the 50 - 100 kev vs. 15 - 25 kev band respectively , both well above the lag range for sgrbs . again",
    "the lag of grb080503 is in contrast with that of grb060614 .",
    "the redshift of grb080503 was not measured mainly because its optical and x - ray afterglows became very faint shortly after the bat trigger ( never exceeding 25 mag in deep observations starting at @xmath146 hr since trigger ) , but the g - band photometric detection imposes a limit of approximately z@xmath1474 ( @xcite ) . in fig .",
    "[ sl ] we show the possible position of grb080503 in the spectral lag - peak luminosity plane relative to the positions of previous lgrbs and sgrbs .",
    "as can be seen , for the extended emission of grb080503 , its position is outside the sgrb population at a very high confidence level regardless of its redshfit . for the spike emission of grb080503 ,",
    "its position is within the sgrb population because of a peak luminosity comparable to that of the extended emission , as well as a negligible spectral lag .",
    "the very faint optical and x - ray afterglows of grb080503 may indicate the circumburst density is very low .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the afterglow is located away from any host galaxy down to 28.5 mag in deep _",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "imaging ( @xcite ) .",
    "these observational signatures contribute to put grb080503 into the merger class .",
    "if we ignore the lag function in classifying grbs and relax the restriction of `` soft - tail '' for a type i grb to `` either soft- or hard- tail '' , then it would be ( even more ) ambiguous , also operationally difficult to define the type of spike@xmath0tail grbs among all long grbs , especially among those at @xmath148 for which a sn search in their afterglows is difficult or impossible .",
    "bearing in mind that grbs can be either luminous or under - luminous , and the redshift could be either high or low , then the problems would be : up to what duration should be classified as a spike , and how much should the flux ratio be for the spike component over the non - spike component ? if grb080503 is interpreted as a merger burst , then it enhances the possibility that a merger could produce a long grb , at least in the prompt emission phase , mimicking the one produced by a collapsar .",
    "grb080503 is a dark burst with the optical - to - xray spectral slope @xmath149 well below 0.5 , the critical value for defining a dark burst ( @xcite ) , at 0.05 days after the burst .",
    "we speculate that some other dark bursts may have their progenitor same as grb080503 .",
    "the progenitors of grb060505 and grb060614 remain uncertain based on their observations and the current grb and sn theory .",
    "other than the lack of a sn component , their afterglows are actually not peculiar when compared with the afterglows of other lgrbs .",
    "according to the current theoretical study , in the core - collapse scenario the `` fallback''-formed black holes or progenitors with relatively low angular momentum could produce such sn - less grbs ( e.g. , @xcite for observational existence of an extremely faint ibc sn ) , or in the merger scenario the two compact objects also could produce such sn - less grbs if the formed remnant , a differentially rotating neutron star or an uniformly rotating magnetar , has not collapsed into a black hole immediately @xcite .",
    "a difference existing in the afterglows between these two scenarios is that the collapsar model predicts a wind - like circumburst medium created by the wolf - rayet progenitor star while the merger model does not . as a matter of fact the wind signature is not clearly evident in most lgrbs , but this should not necessarily lead to the merger origin for these bursts because the definite wind signature is an ideal case for a constant wind off a massive star .",
    "if lucky enough , the core - collapse origin for a sn - less grb ( no matter whether it has the hard - spike @xmath0 soft - tail structure ) will be quite certain if in the afterglow , either the x - ray flux @xmath150 decays as @xmath151 with its spectrum as @xmath152 for the @xmath153 phase ( normally in early afterglow ) , or the optical decay index is larger than the x - ray decay index by a factor of @xmath154 for the slow cooling phase of the wind scenario .",

    "<S> grb060505 and grb060614 are nearby long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( lgrbs ) without accompanying supernovae ( sne ) down to very strict limits . </S>",

    "<S> we combine new observational data with published data and investigate the multi - band temporal and spectral properties of the two afterglows . </S>",
    "<S> we find that both afterglows can be well interpreted within the framework of the jetted standard external shock wave model , and that the afterglow parameters for both bursts fall well within the range observed for other lgrbs . </S>",
    "<S> hence , from the properties of the afterglows there is nothing to suggest that these bursts should have another progenitor than other lgrbs . </S>",
