    "the local toric version replaces a fan by a single cone and a smooth star subdivision of the fan by a smooth star subdivision of the cone together with a choice of one cone in the subdivision .",

    "j.  wodarczyk has noted that is makes sense to consider the local toric factorization problem also for a vector @xmath17 with rationally dependent coordinates , and this problem can be reduced to the rationally independent case .",
    "we bring here an argument for such a reduction .",
    "similar reduction appears in s.  d.  cutkosky s proof of the monomialization theorem @xcite .    consider a nonsingular @xmath35-dimensional cone @xmath18 and a vector @xmath36 , with possibly rationally dependent coordinates .",
    "a star subdivision of @xmath18 along @xmath17 is a star subdivision of @xmath18 and a choice of an @xmath35-dimensional cone in the subdivision containing @xmath17 ( i.e. , in case there are more than one such cone , we are free to choose any one of them ) .",
    "the factorization problem then is : given two @xmath35-dimensional nonsingular cones @xmath146 and a vector @xmath20 , there exists a nonsingular cone @xmath21 obtained from both @xmath19 and @xmath18 by sequences of star subdivisions along @xmath17 .",
    "it is clear that the factorization problem has a solution only if the interiors of @xmath18 and @xmath19 intersect nontrivially .",
    "we assume that this is the case initially and after every subdivision we choose a cone containing @xmath17 such that this condition again holds .",
    "an extreme case of the factorization problem is when @xmath147 .",
    "then a factorization along any vector @xmath148 ( for instance , @xmath149 with rationally independent coordinates ) is also a factorization along @xmath17 . if @xmath150 , we reduce the factorization problem to the case of @xmath17 with rationally independent coordinates as follows .",
    "the first reduction step is to star subdivide both @xmath19 and @xmath18 along @xmath17 to get to the situation where @xmath151 , @xmath34 and @xmath152 such that the coordinates of @xmath17 with respect to @xmath153 ( hence also with respect to @xmath154 ) are rationally independent . for this write @xmath155 and",
    "consider the vector @xmath156 with nonnegative entries .",
    "it is a simple exercise to show that after a finite sequence of column operations where one subtracts @xmath95 from @xmath157 for @xmath158 , we get to the vector ( after reordering the components ) @xmath159 , such that @xmath160 are linearly independent over @xmath39 . after a similar sequence of star subdivisions of @xmath18",
    ", we get @xmath161 .",
    "note that @xmath162 is the smallest subspace of @xmath163 spanned by rational vectors and containing @xmath17 .",
    "the next step is to use the rationally independent case and factor @xmath164 .",
    "thus after a finite sequence of star subdivisions of @xmath18 and @xmath19 we may assume that the two cones have a common face @xmath165 containing @xmath17 .",
    "after additional subdivisions of @xmath19 we may also assume that @xmath166 .",
    "the final step is to consider the projection @xmath167 , and proceed by induction on dimension the same way as in the proof of theorem  [ thm2 ] .",
    "we recall in this section the monomialization theorem of s. d. cutkosky , and then prove theorem  [ thm1 ] .",
    "let @xmath168 be a regular local ring of dimension @xmath35 containing a field @xmath9 of characteristic zero , and let @xmath11 be a valuation on the fraction field of @xmath7 , such that the valuation ring @xmath169 dominates @xmath7 .",

    "more precisely , if @xmath11 has rank @xmath96 and rational rank @xmath35 ( i.e. , the value group can be embedded in @xmath178 and it contains @xmath35 rationally independent elements ) , then after a finite sequence of monoidal transforms , we may assume that a system @xmath179 of regular parameters of @xmath8 can be expressed in terms of regular parameters @xmath180 of @xmath7 as : @xmath181 where @xmath182 are nonnegative integers and @xmath183 .",
