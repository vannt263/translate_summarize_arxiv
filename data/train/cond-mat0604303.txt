    "the challenge of obtaining a correct band structure for the bismuth - telluride compounds is probably best illustrated by the attempts to calculate the band structure of the well - known thermoelectric compound bi@xmath13te@xmath14 .",
    "de - hass - van alphen experiments@xcite and angle - resolved photo - emission studies@xcite have shown that both the lowest conduction band ( lcb ) and the highest valence band ( hvb ) have six - fold degenerate band edges .",
    "only recently has this been reproduced by band structure calculations@xcite and only very recently has also the gap been correctly predicted.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows : first we briefly review the crystal structure and measured thermoelectric properties .",
    "we then discuss the size of the band gap and compare the theoretical prediction with the experimental measurements .",

    "von neumanns principle relates the point group symmetry of the crystal structure ( monoclinic ) to the tensor properties of the crystal .",
    "the monoclinic symmetry with @xmath21 means that the conductivity tensor will have the symmetry =    _ aa & 0 & _ ac + 0 & _ bb & 0 + _ ca & 0 & _ cc +    and similarly for the seebeck coefficient .    experimentally a good conductivity was only found parallel to the short @xmath19-axis,@xcite as would be expected from the crystal structure .",
    "consequently good thermoelectric properties were only found when measured parallel to the @xmath19-axis.@xcite the measured seebeck coefficient rises monotonically up to approximately 275  k ( @xmath22v / k ) and starts to decrease at higher temperatures .",
    "this is in good agreement with the very narrow band gaps , ranging from 0.04 to 0.1  ev , found experimentally@xcite and means that  only has favorable thermoelectric properties at low temperatures .",
    "it is also important for the thermoelectric properties of  that a high electrical conductivity ( @xmath23  s / cm at 250  k ) and an extremely low lattice thermal conductivity of @xmath24  w / mk ( calculated by using the wiedemann - franz law to subtract @xmath25 from the measured @xmath5 ) parallel to the @xmath19-axis were found.@xcite",
    "the calculations were performed using the l / apw+lo method@xcite as implemented in the wien2k code.@xcite a plane wave cutoff defined by min@xmath26max@xmath27 and sphere sizes of 2.7 were used .",
    "the exchange - correlation potential was calculated with the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe)@xcite and the engel - vosko ( ev)@xcite generalized gradient approximations ( ggas ) .",
    "36 @xmath28-points on a shifted mesh in the ibz were used for the scf calculations    as will be discussed later we find a band gap of zero using the pbe - gga .",

    "can be included in the second variational step.@xcite because of a strong spin - orbit splitting of the bi @xmath12-states at the fermi - level , a correct description of relativistic effects is extremely important and the second variational basis - set must be well converged .",
    "we first performed a calculation using the default energy cut - off ( 1.5  ry ) of the wien code and did find that this induces a small gap of 0.012  ev . to test convergence",
    "we then performed two calculations : one setting a high energy cut - off ( 6.0  ry ) and another with a smaller cut - off ( 2.0  ry ) but including @xmath29 local orbitals@xcite for the bi atoms at energies close to the fermi level .",
    "both calculations found a band gap of zero and a very good agreement between the two calculations was found .",
    "no details about the second variational basis set were reported in the earlier paper,@xcite but it should be pointed out that a published study on bi@xmath13te@xmath14,@xcite had to be corrected due poor treatment of the @xmath29 contribution.@xcite    the earlier paper@xcite found the lcb minimum at the ( 0.881,0.881,0.175 ) position in the primitive reciprocal basis used in that study . this is the ( 0.238,0,-0.175 ) position in the @xmath18-side reciprocal basis used here .",

    "the earlier paper does not report the procedure used to find the minimum , but only reports using 13 @xmath30 points in the ibz for the self - consistent calculation , which is certainly to coarse a mesh for an exact location of the lcb minimum .",

    "the transport coefficients can be calculated as a function of temperature and chemical potential by integrating the transport distribution @xmath37 the bands , and hence @xmath38 , are left fixed ( thus `` the rigid band approach '' ) and therefore only one band structure calculation needs to be performed per compound . the number of carriers is changed by varying the chemical potential in eqs .",

    "our approach in the present work is too treat it as a constant .",
    "the seebeck coefficient , @xmath39 , is then independent of @xmath35 and can thus be calculated on an absolute scale .",
    "the conductivity can only be calculated with respect to the relaxation time .",
