    "to benefit from the recent progress on the calculation of field - theoretic bound states in light - cone quantization @xcite , we explore methods by which form factors and scattering amplitudes can be extracted nonperturbatively . in the case of form factors , this is relatively straightforward ; well - known formulas @xcite yield the form factors as overlap integrals of fock - state wave functions . for scattering amplitudes ,",
    "the way is less certain .",
    "one possible method @xcite is discussed briefly here .",
    "others have been considered by krger @xcite , ji and surya @xcite , and fuda @xcite .",
    "the formulations given are in terms of light - cone coordinates @xcite , where @xmath1 plays the role of time and the conjugate variable @xmath2 is the light - cone energy .",
    "the light - cone three - momentum is @xmath3 .",
    "an eigenstate @xmath4 of the light - cone hamiltonian operators @xmath5 , @xmath6 and helicity @xmath7 is written as a fock - state expansion @xmath8[d^2k_\\perp ]                \\psi_{p,\\sigma}^{(n)}(x,{\\bf k}_\\perp )                          |n:\\underline{p}_i \\rangle\\ , , \\nonumber\\ ] ] with @xmath9[d^2k_\\perp]=\\int\\delta(1-\\sum_i x_i )                         \\prod_i \\frac{dx_i}{\\sqrt{x_i } }             16\\pi^3\\delta(\\sum_i { \\bf k}_{\\perp i } )                  \\prod_i \\frac{d^2k_{\\perp i}}{16\\pi^3}\\ ] ] and where the @xmath10 are wave functions for @xmath11 particles , @xmath12 are longitudinal momentum fractions , and @xmath13 are relative transverse momenta .",
    "use of light - cone coordinates brings several advantages , including boost invariance of the wave functions .    the eigenvalue problem @xmath14 for fixed @xmath7 determines the wave functions as solutions of a coupled set of integral equations .",
    "a method frequently applied to these equations is discrete light - cone quantization ( dlcq ) @xcite , which approximates the integrals by the trapezoidal rule and computes the wave functions on an equally spaced momentum grid .",
    "any bound - state property can then , in principle , be calculated from these wave functions .",
    "the grid is parameterized by a longitudinal resolution @xmath15 and transverse resolution @xmath16 , such that longitudinal momentum fractions are multiples of @xmath17 and transverse momenta have as many as @xmath18 values in each direction .",
    "the value of @xmath16 is associated with a cutoff @xmath19 on the invariant mass of each constituent and with the choice of transverse momentum scale @xmath20 .",
    "for a spin-@xmath21 fermion , the two form factors can be obtained from matrix elements of the plus component of the electromagnetic current @xmath22 @xmath23 these can be reduced to overlap integrals @xcite @xmath24[d^2k_\\perp ]      \\psi_{p+q,1/2}^{(n)*}(x,{\\bf k}_\\perp^\\prime )     \\psi_{p,1/2}^{(n)}(x,{\\bf k}_\\perp)\\,,\\ ] ] @xmath25[d^2k_\\perp ]      \\psi_{p+q,1/2}^{(n)*}(x,{\\bf k}_\\perp^\\prime )     \\psi_{p,-1/2}^{(n)}(x,{\\bf k}_\\perp)\\ , ,   \\nonumber\\ ] ] in the frame where the photon momentum @xmath26 is written @xmath27 and @xmath28    for the model studied by brodsky , hiller , and mccartor @xcite , an explicit calculation of @xmath29 has been done @xcite . in this model , a bare fermion acts as a source and sink for bosons of mass @xmath30 .",
    "the lowest massive eigenstate is a fermion dressed by a boson cloud .",
    "the theory is regulated by a pauli  villars boson @xcite with an imaginary coupling , and renormalized by fits of physical quantities to `` data . '' because no spin - flip interactions are included , @xmath31 is zero .",
    "results for @xmath29 are shown in fig .",
