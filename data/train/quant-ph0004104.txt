    "how can we turn quantum systems into useful and practical information processing devices ? at present",
    "we do not know a detailed implementation but we have taken important steps both theoretically and experimentally to resolve this question . the ultimate such device will be a quantum computer ( qc ) , and although such devices are beyond today s experimental reach , we do have related devices which are capable of performing information processing .",
    "quantum processors ( qp ) use the laws of quantum mechanics for computation , communication , and information storage  @xcite .",
    "what distinguishes quantum processors from classical ones is the ability to operate quantum mechanically on superpositions of quantum states and to exploit the resulting interference effects . to take advantage of qip",
    "therefore requires quantum mechanically controllable physical devices .",
    "the difficulty of building suitable devices can not be overestimated : the extreme fragility of quantum information compared to its classical counterpart makes robust manipulations much more difficult .",
    "furthermore , it is exactly these fragile states that needs to be harnessed to achieve the potential of qip . to turn qip into a useful technology requires exploring vast , new territories of quantum mechanics to advance our understanding and our control of quantum mechanical systems  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , as this volume shows , there is a rich variety of proposals for qip implementations .    to evaluate , compare and measure the success of quantum devices for qip requires milestones on the long road towards building a quantum computer .",
    "a qp is a physical device that operates via the laws of quantum mechanics , whose evolution can be adequately controlled , with noise and decoherence  @xcite held in check .",
    "ultimately this control will lead to scalability , permitting fault tolerant computations such as shor s factoring algorithm or quantum physics simulations .",
    "qps can be compared on the basis of their controllability , reliability , scale and efficiency .",
    "while all proposals for qip devices include provisions for reliable control , to our knowledge scalability can only be achieved through the key theoretical discovery of fault tolerant quantum computing . before this discovery",
    ", it was suggested that most computationally interesting problems would never be solved using quantum computers  @xcite : without methods of error control quantum computers lose their power .",
    "fault tolerant quantum computing is based on the existence of quantum error correcting codes  @xcite .",
    "the main result is the accuracy threshold theorem  @xcite which shows that errors in control can be tolerated : it is possible to efficiently compute as accurately as desired provided the basic device s precision exceeds a threshold .",
    "consequently , errors of real devices are not a fundamental obstacle to qip .",
    "the accuracy threshold depends on the types of noise that can affect a device and estimates for the maximum allowable error probabilities range from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "fidelity of control is perhaps the most useful benchmark for comparing qps , being directly related to the scalability of quantum devices .    in this contribution",
    "we discuss current and proposed roles for nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) based qip , including liquid state , solid state and engineered systems ( see also the contribution by jones @xcite ) .",
    "the relationship between information theory and nmr extends back to the beginning of nmr s experimental explorations . in 1946 , the groups of purcell  @xcite and bloch  @xcite observed for the first time the magnetic induction of nuclear spins .",
    "this opened a new field of research leading to many important applications such as molecular structure determination , dynamics studies both in the liquid and solid state  @xcite , and magnetic resonance imaging  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the clearest example of early connections to information theory is the spin echo  @xcite where hahn demonstrated that inhomogeneous interactions could be refocused to the extent that the phase of the nuclear spins retain information about the local field .",
    "this was followed by the magic echo in the solid state  @xcite which inverts the dipolar hamiltonian so that the system can be returned to a prior state by using the fact that the history of spin evolution is stored in the density matrix .",
    "indeed , the idea of using nuclear spins for information storage was suggested by anderson and hahn as early as  1955  @xcite .",
    "recently , nmr was proposed as an accessible technology for qip  @xcite .",
    "the nmr proposals are unique in that the first generation devices based on liquid state nmr have already manipulated systems of up to seven qubits using commercial technology .",
    "the main achievement of this technology has been to turn theoretical quantum algorithms into experimental ones .",
    "it is a technology where one can test the assumptions of the theory and where one can learn to deal with the imperfections of typical physical devices .",
    "the experiments have also inspired new theoretical investigations of qip  @xcite .",
    "solid state nmr experiments provide a precedent for the controlled manipulation of very high order quantum coherences .",
    "for example , pines and colleagues have demonstrated that systems of hundreds of spin @xmath2 particles can be coherently controlled  @xcite . in the solid state",
    "the decoherence rate can be reduced through coherent averaging and phase coherence times in the seconds have been achieved  @xcite . as the time for basic quantum operations is of the order of 100@xmath3 , the operational accuracy is in principle close to what is needed for scalable fault tolerance .",
    "one of the key lessons of nmr spectroscopy over the last four decades and of nmr qip over the last few years is that nuclear spin @xmath2 systems are extremely robust quantum systems .",
    "their coherence can be precisely manipulated and they decohere slowly on the time scale of the qubit interactions .",
    "our present efforts towards building a qp is based on nuclear spins , with key steps being :    * to develop liquid and solid state nmr methods for coherent control . * to move to solid state nmr , developing methods for achieving high polarization . * to use engineered systems with the goal of increasing clock rate and complexity .",
    "this contribution is organized as follow .",
    "we introduce qip , stressing the fact that qip devices , which are first and foremost controllable quantum systems , emerge as an aspect of general principles of quantum simulation .",
    "the crucial elements required for understanding nmr qip are introduced .",
    "these elements are dynamics , state initialization , and readout .",
    "we then explain the advantages and point out the limitations of the current nmr qip prototypes based on the liquid state . to overcome these limitations ,",
    "we propose a next generation of nmr qps using solid state techniques .",
    "this generation will have very high polarization , faster gate times , slower decoherence rates , and will include resettable qubits to implement error correction .",
    "we conclude by reviewing what has been learned to date by nmr qips and give a brief discussion of the required steps for constructing scalable quantum computers .",
    "in the first chapter of this volume , divincenzo describes the five requirements for a general purpose , scalable , quantum computer , they can be summarized as follows :    * a scalable mapping of the basic units of qip , qubits , into physical systems . * the ability to initialize the state of the physical system to a known initial state corresponding via the mapping to a standard initial state of the qubits . *",
    "the availability of sufficient control via time - dependent hamiltonians for implementing a universal set of quantum gates .",
    "* the availability of sufficient control of the relevant noise mechanism , allowing the implementation of fault tolerant qip . * a qubit specific measurement capability .",
    "this description assumes that qc are based on qubits and states .",
    "there is a more general description using observables and subsystems which is especially important for realizing fault tolerance in noisy quantum systems @xcite . here",
    "we will conform to the state / qubit description but we believe that future qp will be based on an operator description , permitting the direct mapping of observables , and thereby the proper use of subsystems . when designing qps it is helpful to consider the five requirements in the context of a general quantum simulation .",
    "quantum simulation is best described by a diagram ( fig .",
    "[ figure : simphys ] ) which relates the abstract notion of a qp to its physical realization . in this diagram ,",
    "the requirements correspond naturally to the crucial components , as will be explained shortly .    ) , is mapped onto an ideal physical system ( @xmath4 ) whose evolution is made to mimic that of the simulated system by modulating the physical system s internal hamiltonian using average hamiltonian theory .",
    "the mapping is linear and invertible , and any hamiltonian available in the physical space can be explored .",
    "the ideal physical system is implemented by a real physical system ( @xmath5 ) subject to noise.,width=576,height=480 ]    the goal of qip is to transform an initial state @xmath6 by a series of quantum operations .",
    "it is implicitly assumed that the initial state is one that it is relatively easy to reach , such as a thermal state or the ground state so that we do not hide the difficulty of reaching a final state in the starting state .",
    "once the final state is reached , we make a qubit specific measurement",
    ". we can restrict ourselves to measurements on a single qubit ( e.g. qubit # 1 ) for deterministic algorithms .",
    "the process can be summarized by the following steps : @xmath7    the task is to take a physical system and engineer it in such a way as to fashion a qp from its controlled dynamics .",
    "any qp is thus first and foremost a physical system with its own internal and interaction hamiltonians and modes of decoherence .",
    "this physical system is used to in effect simulate qubits , initial states , quantum gates , and measurements .",
    "the diagram of fig .",
    "[ figure : simphys ] shows the relationship between the ideal qp and the physical system in two steps ( top to bottom ) , the first involving an ideal , noiseless physical system , and the second showing the process associated with the actual , noisy system .",
    "the correspondence between divincenzo s five requirements and the key steps in the simulation are described explicitly in the following subsections .",
    "the simplest building block for qip is the qubit @xcite .",
    "a qubit is a two level system with basic states @xmath8 and @xmath9 corresponding to the configurations of a classical bit .",
    "qubits can be represented by distinguishable spin @xmath2 particles to obtain a straightforward mapping from the computational to the physical space .",
    "when describing states of multi - qubits we will suppress the tensor product operator between them so that @xmath10 will written as @xmath11 .",
    "the states of the qp are related to states of the ( ideal ) physical system by the scalable mapping @xmath12 ( fig .",
    "[ figure : simphys ] ) .",
    "scalability requires that the mapping can be efficiently extended to cover additional qubits .",
    "the preparation of a known initial state is accomplished by preparing the state mapped by @xmath12 in the physical system , @xmath13    in most proposals for a qc requirement # 2 , preparing a known starting state , is achieved by cooling the system to the ground state either by contact to a cold reservoir or by active means .",
    "examples of cooling methods in nmr include optical pumping @xcite and dynamic nuclear polarization @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is to map the initial state of the system into a state that behaves the same with respect to expectation value measurements up to an overall scale factor .",
    "such states are called pseudo - pure states .",
    "they can be created from highly mixed states states as was shown early in the development of nmr qip  @xcite .",
    "[ subsection : pps ] gives a detailed implementation .",
    "their use requires sufficiently high signal - to - noise in the measurements which limits their scalability at high temperature .",
    "nevertheless pseudo - pure states can be used to investigate and benchmark small qps , and this is the approach taken in liquid state nmr . on the other hand , some efficient algorithms with no known efficient classical counterparts can be implemented with initial highly mixed states which are scalable  @xcite .",
    "in qip we can think of applying control through a sequence of gates .",
    "the complete set of quantum gates are constructed by using time - varying hamiltonians in the physical system to simulate the gates at each step .",
    "thus the overall propagator in the ideal physical system is @xmath14 .",
    "a method to analyze coherent control using time - varying hamiltonians has been developed years ago ( much before the advent of qip ) by waugh and his colleagues  @xcite called average hamiltonian theory ( aht ) .",
    "aht provides a quantitative approach to understanding questions of coherent control and is complementary to the gate based methods of qip .",
    "it enables one to solve for the evolution of the state at a time @xmath15 by writing the evolution of a time independent average hamiltonian @xmath16 .",
    "average hamiltonian theory separates the dynamics into a time invariant internal hamiltonian , @xmath17 , and a time dependent external hamiltonian , @xmath18 , giving a total hamiltonian of @xmath19 .",
    "the overall dynamics after a period of evolution is then given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the dyson time ordering operator .",
    "the average hamiltonian defined by this equation is the time independent hamiltonian that would result in the same propagator if it were applied over the same period . if the total hamiltonian commutes with itself at all times , @xmath22",
    "this is rarely the case . for sufficiently small @xmath15",
    ", the magnus expansion  @xcite provides a formal means of calculating the average hamiltonian : @xmath23 where , @xmath24.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] examples of the use of aht to implement quantum gates are included in the following section .",
    "the development of aht is a prime example of how the development of nmr anticipated many of the ideas of qip using a different language . in the context of nmr",
    "waugh demonstrated that :    * aht can be used to design a control scheme for implementing a desired average hamiltonian , * any average hamiltonian ( up to a scalar multiple ) can be implemented in most nmr systems of distinguishable spins  @xcite . *",
    "the average hamiltonian can be implemented to an arbitrary precision if decoherence ( random noise in the system and in the control ) is neglected .",
    "aht solves the problem of making available a complete set of gates in the physical systems to meet requirement # 3 .",
    "the nuclear spins in a molecule can be chosen to be coupled by internal hamiltonians in a connected coupling network ( explained in sec",
    ".  [ section : nmr ] ) , and the results of aht given above show that in this case , a complete set of gates can be implemented in principle .",
    "there are many equivalent sets of gates that are complete for the purpose of qip .",
    "there are minimal sets consisting of one gate only , but for efficient physical implementation , other sets are more convenient  @xcite .",
    "the basic property of these gate sets are that any unitary transformation can in principle be decomposed to arbitrary precision into a sequence of gates from the set .",
    "one such set consists of the operations on one and two qubits given in the next two equations , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a real unit vector .",
    "this defines a rotation by @xmath12 around @xmath27 in the bloch ( or poincar ) sphere associated with the state space of a qubit .",
    "the standard two qubit operation is the controlled - not defined by @xmath28 it flips the second qubit only if the first bit is in the state @xmath9 .",
    "the gates in this set can be applied to any one or two qubits in the computational space .",
    "example nmr implementations of these gates are given in sec .",
    "[ section : nmr ] .",
    "the extent to which requirement # 3 is met in nmr depends on the details of the system used .",
    "since , as explained above , the control is in principle sufficient to implement the desired gates with arbitrarily accuracy , it is the extent to which random noise affects the gates that is important .",
    "probabilities of errors per gate due to random noise can be as low as @xmath29 in liquid state systems for the most easily implementable two qubit gates .",
    "noise can be controlled in principle through quantum error correction . in order",
    "that fault tolerant method be effective it is sufficient to be below an accuracy threshold , i.e. that the noise per gate be smaller than a threshold value .",
    "the threshold is determined by the the types of errors and control we have over the device . in order to implement these fault tolerant procedures we have to increase the size of the physical system but only by a `` reasonable '' amount ( polynomial in the size of th problem considered ) .",
    "the measurement of one or more qubits translates via @xmath12 to a corresponding measurement in the physical system .",
    "usually the measurement is required to be projective . however , for most purposes , it is sufficient to make a noisy expectation value measurement of a single qubit ( this works for all computations where a specific answer is desired  @xcite ) . projective measurements with known outcomes are in fact useful only for improvements in efficiency .",
    "thus we require that it is possible to measure @xmath30 $ ] with constant signal to noise .",
    "if it were possible to measure this with infinite signal to noise , i.e. exactly , then an apparently much more powerful model of computation is obtained , with simple algorithms for solving np hard problems .",
    "the quantity measured corresponds to @xmath31 $ ] in the physical system .",
    "the ability to make expectation value measurements as demanded by our version of requirement # 5 is easily available in nmr and is what makes nmr such a useful technology .",
    "nmr provides a valuable test bed for qip ideas , since both the internal hamiltonian and the relaxation superoperator are well known and reliable methods for controlling the dynamics are available .",
    "no other technology has so far reached the ability to control the number of qubits accessible in nmr ( currently seven ) . in addition , there are forty years of experience in using nmr to explore chemical structure , dynamics and reactions .",
    "such experience has led to robust instrumentation capable of complex experiments and to a wealth of practical methods for understanding spin dynamics .    a block diagram of an nmr spectrometer for qip is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : spec ] . even though the goals of standard nmr experiments and qip are quite different , the instrumentation requirements are very similar and the same device can be used for both purposes . in liquid state nmr spectroscopy",
    "the goal is to characterize the chemistry / dynamics of a solution containing known or unknown molecules via a series of well characterized experiments tailored to elicit specific components of the hamiltonian or relaxation superoperator in an easy to interpret fashion . in nmr qip",
    "the goal is to characterize the effective overall transformation of a complex series of operations on a very well characterized sample whose internal hamiltonian and relaxation superoperator are precisely known .",
    "ultimately the goal is to apply series of transformations sufficiently complex to be beyond the capacity of a classical computer .      in nmr ,",
    "the qubits are spin @xmath2 nuclei in a molecule .",
    "although in principle other nuclei can be used by observing that a spin @xmath32 nucleus can represent @xmath33 qubits , this however increases the complexity of implementing the standard quantum gates given the hamiltonians that are usually available for control .",
    "distinguishable spin @xmath2 particles are convenient physical qubits since , being two state systems , the mapping from the computational space is usually straightforward and consists of associating each qubit with one of the spins . for the liquid and solid state nmr devices the spins",
    "are distinguishable on the basis of the internal hamiltonian which is given by the chemistry of the sample . for engineered systems",
    "it is assumed that nuclear spins and thus qubits can be spatially localized .",
    "the robustness of spin @xmath2 particles is due to the fact that they can interact directly only with magnetic , not with electric fields .",
    "this is particularly valuable since other than adjacent qubits , sources of magnetic fields , will generally be distant and as a result the interaction takes on a dipole - dipole symmetry .",
    "nuclear spins have the additional advantage of being shielded by the electron cloud and thus being very well isolated from most sources of fluctuating magnetic fields , leading typically to long decoherence times .",
    "nmr relies on a strong applied magnetic field to provide the dominant terms of the internal hamiltonian .",
    "the zeeman interaction then provides a convenient and uniform axis of quantization , with the sum of the @xmath34 giving useful quantum numbers . as a result ,",
    "in the weak coupling limit ( i.e when the difference between chemical shifts is much larger than the coupling between spins ) , the eigenstructure of the internal hamiltonian is easy to determine .",
    "the form of the internal hamiltonian of a molecule s nuclear spins is then to very good approximation , @xmath35 where the summation is over the nuclear spins . for liquid state nmr",
    "a typical sample contains @xmath36 molecules , each one acting as an independent qp .",
    "many copies are necessary since the zeeman interaction is very weak and approximately @xmath37 spins are necessary to observe a signal .",
    "the spectrometer records the average state of the spins and the computation has to preserve the hilbert space spanned by a single molecule .",
    "the through space , spin - spin , dipolar interaction between molecules is averaged to zero by random molecular motions on the time scale of the control and measurement normally used , and is therefore only indirectly observable via the effect on decoherence .",
    "the form of the hamiltonian is convenient for qip .",
    "the single particle terms are naturally useful to distinguish qubits , while the two - particle terms form the building blocks of conditional , two qubit gates .",
    "the constants @xmath38 and @xmath39 depend on the structure and electron configuration of the molecule .",
    "the resonance frequencies @xmath38 depend on the efficiency of screening of the nuclear spins from the applied magnetic field by the surrounding electrons and the scalar couplings @xmath39 are mediated by electrons in molecular orbitals that overlap both nuclear spins .",
    "the constants of the internal hamiltonian of the nuclear spins of a molecule can be derived from an nmr spectrum acquired following a non - selective rf excitation pulse .",
    "[ figure : alanine ] shows the spectrum for @xmath40 labeled alanine .",
    "( the @xmath41 s were removed from the hamiltonian ( and spectrum ) through spin decoupling , described in sec .",
    "[ subsection : decoupling ] . )",
    "the constants can be read off ( in frequency units ) from the positions of the peaks .",
    "thus the three @xmath40 nuclei at @xmath42 are governed by the hamiltonian @xmath43 + { } \\nonumber\\\\   & & ( \\pi/2)[53\\,\\sigma_z^a\\sigma_z^b +   38\\ , \\sigma_z^a\\sigma_z^c + 1.2\\,\\sigma_z^b\\sigma_z^c],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where all of the frequencies are given in hz .",
    "the last two terms of the first line induce so - called chemical shifts which distinguish qubits .",
    "the second line gives the couplings between qubits .",
    "the simplicity of the internal hamiltonian also carries over to the allowed modes of decoherence since there is no energy change associated with a phase shift about the applied external field .",
    "the interaction of the environment thus only attenuates the off diagonal elements of the density matrix ( it does not mix these ) , and the liouvillian has a simple and sparse form .",
    "the relaxation superoperator is simplest to describe in terms of a set of product operators in the raising and lowering basis of the quantization axis .",
    "the state of the system at any time on the other hand can be described as a sum of direct products of the states of the individual spins , and these product states have very simple transformation rules under both the internal and external hamiltonians@xcite .    in nmr",
    "the relaxation superoperator @xcite is called the redfield kite , named after alfred redfield who first described it .",
    "it is called a kite to provide a descriptive name for the structure of the non - zero elements . for a three spin system ,",
    "the superoperator has @xmath44 elements , of which only 120 are non - zero in the absence of cross - correlation .",
    "the form of the relaxation superoperator is summarized compactly in the following table .",

    "the number following the colon on the vertical axis indicates the number of elements that are grouped together by symmetry .",
    "the grouping is convenient because if each spin sees the same fluctuating field , then these elements will decohere at the same rate .",
    "control over the spin state is achieved through externally controllable hamiltonians describing the interactions of the spin with either rf pulses or magnetic field gradients .",
    "the applied hamiltonian has the following form , assuming only one nuclear species : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the carrier frequency of the rf pulse and @xmath63 is the effective amplitude of the rf field .",
    "the rf pulses can be applied non - selectively ( to uniformly tilt all spins ) by choosing @xmath64 , or to selectively excite a single spin by choosing and modulating @xmath63 subject to @xmath65 . here",
    "@xmath66 is the difference between the transmitter frequency and that of the off - resonant spins .",
    "the selective version of @xmath67 directly implements a useful version of the single qubit gate , provided that the pulse time is kept short compared to @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the largest coupling constant .",
    "it is useful to perform computation with gates easily implemented by the physical system .",
    "for example , many quantum algorithms are written in terms of hadamard gates , @xmath70 which in terms of a time independent hamiltonian corresponds to a @xmath71 rotation about the @xmath72 direction .",
    "the hadamard gate is used to rotate basis states into superpositions .",
    "superpositions can also be reached through a @xmath73 rotation about the @xmath74-axis , @xmath75 which is simpler to implement in nmr .",
    "often a computation can be written in terms of gates that correspond more directly to the physical system .",
    "a second example of physical gates are selective z - rotations which may be obtained from a series of rf pulses .",
    "this uses the fact that rotations around the @xmath74 and @xmath76 do not commute giving rise to z - rotations .",
    "another possibility to implement z - rotation is to make a change of reference frame . referring back to the block diagram of the spectrometer ( and recalling that z - rotations commute with the internal hamiltonian ) we see that z - rotations can be accounted for in the reference phase of the individual transmitters and thus in general no explicit pulses",
    "are required . keeping track of z - rotations",
    "becomes a book - keeping task .",
    "a somewhat neglected part of qip is the ability to introduce selective decoherence at will .",
    "this is convenient for preparing specific states and required for removing undesired information . since nmr methods are ensemble measurements we may take advantage of the spatial distribution of the sample to create qubit selective decoherence .",
    "decoherence is obtained by the action of a magnetic field gradient followed by molecular diffusion to remove all recoverable spatial correlation .",
    "the essential feature is that the spectrometer is normally equipped with a magnetic field gradient coil connected to a programmable current source , so the hamiltonian is , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the gyromagnetic ratio , and @xmath79 is the spatial location of the spin along the gradient direction .",
    "the action of the gradient is to create a linear phase ramp throughout the sample @xcite which provides a decoherence mechanism with relaxation rate given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the time during which the spin system evolved in the magnetic field gradient , and the experiment consists of two strong , short and ( effectively ) opposite gradient pulses separated by the decoherence interval .",
    "we will now show that through a combination of the internal hamiltonian , modulated via time - dependent external hamiltonians designed following the prescriptions of average hamiltonian theory , any desired unitary operator can be achieved .",
    "it is only necessary to do this for a complete set of gates such as the c - not and single qubit gates ( described above ) , but we will start by exploring a no - operation gate .",
    "a useful benchmark of qip is the ability to suppress the internal hamiltonian and thus to leave the system in whatever state it started in .",
    "this will also permit us to describe coherent averaging in some detail .",
    "[ subsection : decoupling ]    one interesting feature of nmr compared to a device like the ion trap is that the coupling between qubits is always active .",
    "refocusing methods have been invented to selectively turn off undesired couplings , so as to suppress their contribution to the effective propagator over some time interval .",
    "for example , starting with the internal hamiltonian for a three qubit system : @xmath82 we can implement the identity operation using the sequence of rf pulses shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : noop ] .    the effect of the sequence of fig .",
    "[ figure : noop ] can be appreciated by breaking up the evolution into its four equal time parts , assuming that the rf pulses are effectively instantaneous , and transforming to a time - dependent interaction frame defined by the rf pulses ( termed toggling frame hamiltonian by waugh  @xcite ) . the interaction - frame form of the internal hamiltonian can be broken up into commuting parts .",

    "this is facilitated by the fact that in the solid state both the chemical shift and dipolar coupling retain their anisotropy and hence reorientation of the sample relative to the external magnetic field provides a convenient way for controlling their relative strengths .",
    "an important goal is to ensure that the spectral separation between any two qubits is appreciably larger than their dipolar coupling .",

    "first , the deuterium lattice is polarized by transfer of the free electron polarization . then this polarization is transferred to the qp s spins via cross polarization  @xcite .",
    "since the heat capacity of the lattice is much greater than that of the dilute molecules of the qp this transfer will polarize the qp close to the initial polarization of the electrons .    to increase the dnp signal enhancement the system is kept at @xmath167 , at which temperatures the electron spins are nearly in a pure state .",
    "the system is also arranged so that the qps are far enough apart that they do not directly see the color centers , which under normal circumstances would be the primary source of decoherence ( the crystal is well below its debye temperature ) . at such low temperatures the spin - spin interactions are more important than the phonon motions and",
    "the only fluctuating magnetic fields arise from the lifetimes of the z - component of the electron spin , which has a relatively short spin - lattice relaxation time .",
    "the double quantum decoupling method mentioned earlier also decouples the deuterium spins from one another so that spin transport through the lattice is quenched and the color centers no longer play a significant relaxation role  @xcite .",
    "thus the decoherence times of the qps will be very long ( of order @xmath168 seconds ) . notice that the electrons play no role in the computation and their short decoherence time is in fact a benefit for rapid state preparation without in any way limiting the achievable computational complexity .",
    "in future implementations it may be feasible to include an erasable quantum register .",
    "this permits the complete purification of states through polarization pumping  @xcite , the efficient implementation of quantum error - correction codes , and provides a source of decoherence to mimic the effect of strong measurements .",
    "this register could be composed from a set of quadrupolar spins in the molecule of a qp that are engineered to be coupled to the qp s qubits .",
    "quadrupolar nuclear spins couple to the local electric field gradient and thus are sensitive to acoustic modulations  @xcite which enhance decoherence rates .",
    "an acoustic pulse can thus decohere the erasable register , while leaving the spin @xmath2 nuclei in the qp in any given state .",
    "the erasable register must then be repolarized .",
    "this use of erasable ancilla results in even small qcs being quite powerful since quantum resources need not to be borrowed for non - computational tasks .",
    "the five requirements of a physical quantum computer are explored below .",
    "we hope to convince the reader that the requisites for building a functional prototype quantum computer are within reach through an amalgamation of solid state nmr methods . at the same time",
    "we caution that the proposed qip device will function on 10 through perhaps 30 qubits , which while making it by far the largest quantum processor to date ( and possibly just beyond what can presently be simulated on a classical computer ) the system will not be scalable .",
    "we believe however that it is only through the exploration of such quantum devices that scalable quantum computers might someday be realized .",
    "we consider each requirement in turn .",
    "although the correspondence between qubits and spin @xmath2 nuclei is clear in this case , its scaling is in fact limited by the need for having readily crystallizable molecules . in principle",
    ", adequate addressability of the qubits is available , if necessary by using quantum cellular automata implementation methods .",
    "we believe that it is possible to design appropriate molecules for up to perhaps 30 qubits .",
    "a more immediate obstacle to implementing this mapping is the presence of an internal hamiltonian which does not preserve the standard basis for qubits , thus requiring active manipulation even for preserving the state .",
    "we address the issue of state preservation in the context of the requirement for implementing a sufficient set of gates .",
    "the complexity of the internal hamiltonian leads to two complications for viewing the spin system as a system of qubits .",
    "first , the eigenbasis is no longer known and so there is not a convenient and stable computational basis , and second the resonances are broadened by the many spin configurations of equal energy ( configurational broadening ) .",
    "the second part is of little concern since we must fully control the internal hamiltonian to have a qp , but the first point implies that individual qubits can not be identified or addressed with rf pulses as easily as is the case in liquid state .",
    "the way out of the this difficulty is to realize that the flip - flop term does not commute with the difference of @xmath34 operators , and that provided a spectral difference ( such as that introduced by chemical shifts ) can be made stronger than the dipolar couplings , the dynamics from the flip - flop term are effectively quenched by second averaging .",
    "such a quenching is of course guaranteed in the case of heteronuclear coupling since the differences in larmor frequencies are some mhz while the dipolar couplings at most in the tens of khz .    for the molecular system to be used in this proposal",
    "we need only concern ourselves with the spins that make up the individual qps , since the deuterated bath will be decoupled from these , and each molecular qp will be well isolated from all other copies .",
    "the qp molecules should thus have the following properties :    * crystallize easily into large single crystals with only one molecule per unit cell .",
    "* have high debye temperatures ( @xmath169 ) .",
    "* be dielectric . *",
    "be composed of a few elements in addition to @xmath41 for which there is an isotope with no spin , and another with spin @xmath170 ( such as @xmath40 ) .",
    "* have an orientation in which all spins are individually addressable .",
    "the complete chemical shift tensors ( with principal axis systems ) are only known precisely for a few molecules since there has been little motivation to measure these",
    ". however , there are enough to ensure that finding a 10 qubit system with the above properties is only a modest challenge .",
    "we will start by exploring organic acids since they have been widely studied , and crystallize well .",
    "an illustrative example is malonic acid  @xcite , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : malonic ] .",
    "an excellent area for appreciating the complexity of homonuclear dipolar coupled spins is zero field spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "zero - field spectroscopy removes the symmetry breaking introduced by the applied magnetic field and permits single crystal like spectra to be acquired for powdered samples .",
    "pines and coworkers have reported both experiments and simulations of small spin systems that show the power and complexity of these methods , and with coupling constants spanning a range of 60 khz for small organic molecules  @xcite .",
    "the state preparation , while perhaps appearing to be complex , is actually the simplest part of the protocol .",
    "we take advantage of the large zeeman splitting of the electron spins so that we have a highly polarized quantum bath at liquid helium temperatures .",
    "this saves us from having to work at the much more challenging mk temperatures .",
    "this polarization can be transferred to the deuterium nuclei by an overhauser type effect through dynamic nuclear polarization , where a single microwave transition is saturated .",
    "the relatively short spin lattice relaxation time of the electrons coupled with their high photon energy provides a large effective heat capacity from which to cool the deuterons . in existing experiments , diamagnetic crystal polarizations of greater than 90% were achieved by such means  @xcite .",
    "an experiment more closely related to this proposal is de boer s polarization of a deuterated sample of ethanediol ( a sample containing @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath171 nuclei ) .",
    "the polarization for @xmath41 and @xmath171 reached 80% and 30% , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the cooling of the deuterium bath to sub - mk spin temperatures is a preparation step that is done before starting the computation . following this",
    "the electrons will no longer take part in any aspect of the computation and the deuterium will act as a polarized bath of nearly infinite heat capacity that the qubits of the qp can be brought into contact at will .",
    "connection to the polarized deuterium bath will be accomplished through hartmann - hahn cross polarization transfer  @xcite , where two nuclear species are put into an interaction frame in which their apparent zeeman energies are matched .",
    "since the qcs are only very dilute in the deuterium bath , the heat capacity of the bath will be much greater than that of the qc meaning that the final polarization of the qc and bath ( following cross - polarization ) will be very nearly the initial polarization of the bath and the bath may be in contact repeatedly without a need to refresh it from the electrons .",
    "of course the suggestion that the bath may be reused implies that as we decouple it we must do so in such a way as to preserve its polarization .",
    "finally , although the qc has been prepared in a state that is quite close to a pure state , we will still need to rely on pseudo - pure or state purification schemes  @xcite , perhaps in conjunction with the resettable register , to achieve a reliable pure state .",
    "the internal hamiltonian in conjunction with the coupling to rf fields provide all of the components necessary to create , in principle , any gate . under the assumption that the resonance frequencies of the spins are sufficiently far apart",
    ", single qubit gates can be implemented by selective rf pulses , while two - qubit gates are implemented by delays which exploit the connected coupling network of the internal hamiltonian .",
    "appropriate refocusing schemes are required to eliminate unwanted contributions from the internal hamiltonian .",
    "in particular , there must be a means for suppressing the internal hamiltonian completely .",
    "if we can suspend the evolution of the internal motions , then we can always add back in any parts we desire . in earlier work",
    "we and others have devised time - suspension sequences that suppress the internal hamiltonian to any desired precision  @xcite and have shown how to add back desired pieces of it  @xcite .",
    "the complications introduced here are that the gates should never interfere with the procedure for @xmath171 decoupling of the bath from the qp .",
    "this requires synchronizing the various multiple - pulse cycles and designing them from the start to work together .",
    "decoherence times of dielectric crystals below their debye temperature are notoriously long in nmr since there is no spontaneous emission and the phonon spectrum is very sparse .",
    "the only relaxation pathway is via defects , and thus will be very sample dependent .",
    "the relaxation rate @xmath172 goes as @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the field due to the electrons , @xmath175 is the applied magnetic field , @xmath176 is the electron relaxation time and @xmath177 the electron polarization .",
    "so in this approximation , as the electrons become polarized , the nuclear relaxation rate vanishes  @xcite .    in a system of dilute molecules with the spin transport through",
    "the lattice turned off through multiple - pulse decoupling , we expect that the decoherence times will be even longer than those typically observed for concentrated samples of abundant spins  @xcite .",
    "times on the order of hours are common ( malonic acid crystals have a @xmath165 of order one hour ) and for clean cubic systems there are examples of relaxation times being so long as to be unmeasurable . even given relatively slow clock speeds in the ms , it is clear that spin lattice relaxation will not significantly limit the computational complexity of the proposed quantum computer .",
    "of course there is the related issue of the spin - spin relaxation time .",
    "any difference between the spin - spin and the spin - lattice relaxation times are due to spin - spin interactions within the qp and these interactions must be precisely controlled to have a functional quantum computer .",
    "this puts a premium on our ability to apply average hamiltonian theory , with multiple pulse cycles to take full control of the spin system , but this is exactly where nmr spectroscopy excels .",
    "the measurement process does not significantly differ from that used in liquid state nmr .",
    "the sample is still an ensemble of processors , and though the polarization is higher and the sample much more dilute , there will still be a sufficient number of spins to have good statistics .",
    "although we hope to reach quite complex hilbert spaces with the solid state nmr approach to qip , this still does not yield a scalable quantum computer .",
    "the number of qubits is limited by the addressing scheme , the gates are far too slow , and the cost of additional qubits too high . while the progression towards more complex qips is stepwise , it is useful to have a trajectory in mind for a path to a scalable quantum computer .    keeping to our model of a qp as a quantum simulation run on a physical system ,",
    "there are two general approaches to implement the required dynamics :    * use the internal hamiltonian and limited external control and move to an appropriate interaction frame to enable qubit - specific operations .",
    "this approach is limited as we can only scale down part of the hamiltonian . *",
    "modify the local hamiltonian by near field interactions that are qubit - selective based on their spatial position and extent .",
    "it appears that the second ( or engineered ) approach will be the eventual direction , but control that relies on the internal hamiltonian is what can be done with high fidelity today .",
    "although there have been some steps taken towards engineered systems  @xcite , little is known about how to manufacture such devices , and even less about how to control them .",
    "as the field progresses towards more complex qip it appears that there are three regimes of complexity / decoherence :    * small scale qps : fully coherent control over a small quantum system , decoherence is not a significant problem and the dynamics could be simulated on a work station ",
    "this is where we are today . *",
    "medium scale qps : complex and high fidelity coherent control of a modest quantum system .",
    "decoherence is present but we can demonstrate accessibility of the full hilbert space .",
    "the dynamics are no longer easily simulated on classical computers  this is where solid state nmr qip is headed . *",
    "large scale qps : local near field control of qps components making general transformations of many qubits much more accessible .",
    "the effects of decoherence on these systems is much more significant requiring sophisticated error - control schemes .",
    "the proposed solid state nmr device is intended to be medium scale , allowing exploration of problems not classically accessible while avoiding the decoherence problems of the more scalable near - field devices .",
    "by enabling reasonably reliable manipulations of quantum information , nmr offers a useful test bed for qip . the elements essential @xcite for quantum information have been demonstrated .",
    "it is also moving theoretical successes from the desk to the laboratory benchtop and helps in understanding the difficulties of harnessing the power of quantum computation .",
    "nmr techniques have been developed in the spectroscopy community to deal with a wide range of coherent errors and although the final technology for quantum computation might not resemble what we can imagine today , the set of techniques being developed are needed to make progress .",
    "another important contribution from nmr has been to question some of the naive explanations of the power of quantum computation such as the need for pure states and entanglement . as a result",
    ", it has been realized that qip extends well beyond quantum computing or communication , and the relative computational power of devices which do not fit the standard model is starting to be explored .    despite the limitations of liquid state nmr ,",
    "it is likely to be the first technology to control ten qubits .",
    "many of these limitations will be overcome by a second generation of nmr based devices which has the potential to exceed the classical predictable realm .",
    "our solid state proposal , by starting with high polarization and having a resettable register , allows a better understanding of practical quantum error correction .",
    "it is our hope that it will also allow a better understanding of quantum simulation and decoherence .",
    "as qip devices access increasing numbers of qubits , it becomes increasingly difficult to simulate them using classical computers ( and is impossible at around 30 - 40 qubits ) .",
    "this should be seen as an opportunity to investigate a new territory inaccessible to classical simulations .",
    "systematic ways to deal with the complexity of these systems will have to be developed such as benchmarking and trouble shooting imperfections of physical devices . on the other hand",
    "the number of qubits available in solid state nmr is still small compared to what is needed for implementing the gamut of fault tolerant techniques .",
    "we will thus have to develop methods to investigate extremely large hilbert spaces and verify the quality of the implemented operations .",
    "the work in nmr will contribute to these developments .",
    "the recent discovery that quantum mechanics allows more powerful manipulations of information than its classical counterpart has the potential to revolutionize information processing .",
    "although the accuracy threshold theorem shows that in principle , the limitations of quantum systems due to noise and decoherence can be overcome , this does not mean that the road to scalable qip will be without difficulties .",
    "the required accuracies will be hard to achieve in practice , and at present we can only explore small scale quantum information .",
    "it is of course possible that we will not be able to reach the accuracy threshold nor ever implement algorithmically interesting quantum computations .",
    "however , as more than 100 spin coherences have been manipulated , controlled and observed in solid state nmr , the main concern is our ability to maintain information in effectively distinguishable qubits .",
    "this is both a question of complexity and of stability .",
    "so while we are still struggling with the new quantum technology and its control , we are approaching the situation where we can ask whether there is any new physics which prohibits scalable manipulations of quantum information . as a result ,",
