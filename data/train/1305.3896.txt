    "in recent years there has been a great deal of interest in the question of locating the zeros of modular forms .",
    "much of this work stems from results of f. rankin and swinnerton - dyer  @xcite , who showed that the zeros of the classical eisenstein series @xmath5 , for even @xmath6 , lie on the lower boundary of the standard fundamental domain for @xmath7 .",
    "similar results have been obtained for eisenstein series for a number of other congruence subgroups in the papers  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the zeros for hecke eigenforms of level 1 become equidistributed in the fundamental domain , rather than congregating on its boundary , as the weight increases ( see  @xcite and  @xcite )",
    ". even considering this equidistribution , though , some zeros still appear on the boundary ; ghosh and sarnak  @xcite showed that for these eigenforms , the number of zeros on the boundary and center line of the fundamental domain for @xmath7 also grows with the weight .",
    "the second author , with duke  @xcite and with garthwaite  @xcite , studied the zeros of weakly holomorphic modular forms of level @xmath8 .",
    "specifically , they showed that for a two - parameter family of weakly holomorphic modular forms that is a canonical basis for the space , almost all of the basis elements have all ( if @xmath9 ) or most ( if @xmath10 ) of their zeros on a lower boundary of a fundamental domain for @xmath11 .",
    "thus , most or all of the zeros of these families of weakly holomorphic forms are the `` real zeros '' studied by ghosh and sarnak .    in this paper , we examine the zeros of a canonical basis for the space of weakly holomorphic modular forms of level @xmath2 which are holomorphic away from the cusp at @xmath3 , and show that most of the zeros lie on a circular arc along the lower boundary of a fundamental domain .",
    "additionally , we give a generating function for this canonical basis and show that the fourier coefficients of the basis elements satisfy several interesting properties .",
    "we let @xmath12 be the space of holomorphic modular forms of even integer weight @xmath1 for the group @xmath13 , and we let @xmath14 be the space of weakly holomorphic modular forms , or modular forms that are holomorphic on the upper half plane and meromorphic at the cusps . in this paper , we specifically examine the space @xmath15 , which is the subspace of @xmath16 that is holomorphic away from the cusp at infinity .",
    "atkinson  @xcite studied modular forms in @xmath16 and @xmath0 , giving explicit descriptions of the action of a differential operator , recurrences for their coefficients , and an identity for the exponents of their infinite product expansions .",
    "this generalized work of bruinier , kohnen , and ono  @xcite in level @xmath17 and of ahlgren  @xcite for levels @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "any fundamental domain for @xmath4 has three cusps , which can be taken to be @xmath3 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 . the fundamental domain we use is bordered by the lines @xmath22 and the semicircles defined by @xmath23 for @xmath24 $ ] . as shown in figure  [ figure 1 ] , instead of taking a single cusp at @xmath25 , we take a symmetric fundamental domain which meets the real line at @xmath20 and @xmath26 .",
    "the bottom left semicircle is equivalent to the bottom right semicircle under the action of the matrix @xmath27 , and the left border is equivalent to the right border by using the matrix @xmath28 .",
    "we recall that the valence formula for level @xmath2 is given by @xmath29 so that a modular form in @xmath16 has a weighted sum of exactly @xmath30 zeros and poles .",
    "we next define several useful modular forms of level @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath31 , as usual .",
    "it is well known that @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the classical theta function .",
    "we note that @xmath34 has its single zero at the cusp at @xmath25 .",
    "we also define @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the classical eisenstein series of weight @xmath37 .",
    "the valence formula shows that @xmath38 has a simple zero at @xmath3 , and vanishes nowhere else in the fundamental domain . with these functions",
    ", we can define a hauptmodul for @xmath4 by @xmath39 the function @xmath40 has a pole at @xmath3 and vanishes at the cusp at @xmath21 .",
    "we can define similar weight 0 hauptmoduln by modifying the constant term ; specifically , we define @xmath41 which has zero constant term and vanishes at @xmath42 , and @xmath43 which vanishes at the cusp at @xmath20 .",
    "we now define a canonical basis for @xmath44 similar to the bases defined for levels @xmath45 , and @xmath46 in  @xcite . for any even weight @xmath47 ,",
    "the elements @xmath48 of this basis have a fourier expansion of the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the order of the pole at infinity .",
    "these basis elements can be constructed recursively : the first basis element @xmath51 is given by @xmath52 , and @xmath48 is constructed from @xmath53 by multiplying by @xmath54 and subtracting off integral linear combinations of previously constructed basis elements @xmath55 with @xmath56 to obtain the appropriate gap in the fourier expansion . in general , these basis elements take the form @xmath57 , where @xmath58 $ ] is a generalized faber polynomial of degree @xmath59 ( see  @xcite ) . from the valence formula ,",
    "since @xmath60 has a pole of order @xmath61 at @xmath3 and no other poles , it must have @xmath62 zeros elsewhere in the fundamental domain or at the cusps @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "since @xmath63 gives a bijection between the fundamental domain and the riemann sphere , these zeros all lie on the bottom arc of the fundamental domain if and only if the zeros of the polynomial @xmath64 are real and lie in the interval @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "the main theorem of this paper is as follows .",
    "[ mainthm ] let @xmath48 be defined as above .",
    "if @xmath66 and @xmath67 , or if @xmath68 and @xmath69 , then at least @xmath70 of the @xmath71 nontrivial zeros of @xmath48 in the fundamental domain for @xmath4 lie on the lower boundary of the fundamental domain .    we note that this bound is not sharp",
    ". computations of faber polynomials show that most of these basis elements appear to have more zeros on this arc .",
    "however , in some cases , we do not expect all of the zeros to be on the arc .",
    "for instance , if the faber polynomial @xmath72 $ ] is of very small degree , then for large enough @xmath73 its zeros may be computed to be outside of the interval @xmath74 $ ] , and thus the zeros of the corresponding basis element are not on the lower boundary of the fundamental domain .",
    "we can define a similar basis for a subspace of @xmath44 consisting of forms that vanish at the cusps @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we denote the basis elements as @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "the @xmath77 can be constructed in a manner similar to the @xmath48 ; the first basis element is given by @xmath78 , and they have the general form @xmath79 , where @xmath80 $ ] is a faber polynomial of degree @xmath81 . they have a correspondingly smaller gap in their fourier expansions .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ mainthm ] can be modified to show that the majority of the zeros of the @xmath77 in a fundamental domain for @xmath4 also lie on the lower boundary .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath60 and the @xmath82 are closely related and share several interesting properties .",
    "for instance , in examining the fourier expansions of several basis elements of weight @xmath83 , we see that @xmath84 while the corresponding basis elements in weight @xmath85 have the following fourier expansions .",
    "@xmath86 in these examples , the basis elements have fourier expansions with exponents that are all even or all odd , and the coefficient of @xmath87 in @xmath48 is the negative of the coefficient of @xmath88 in @xmath89 .",
    "these properties hold in general , and we will prove the following theorems .",
    "[ duality ] let @xmath48 and @xmath77 be defined as above .",
    "then for all integers @xmath90 with @xmath1 even , we have the duality of coefficients @xmath91    [ evenodd ] let @xmath48 be defined as above . if @xmath92 , then @xmath93 .",
    "theorem  [ duality ] establishes the duality of fourier coefficients between the basis elements @xmath60 of weight @xmath1 and the basis elements @xmath94 of weight @xmath95 , while theorem  [ evenodd ] shows that the exponents appearing in the fourier expansion of @xmath48 are either all even or all odd .",
    "the duality results are analogous to similar dualities first proved in  @xcite for integral weight modular forms of level @xmath17 and in  @xcite for half integral weight modular forms of level @xmath2 .    the remainder of the paper proceeds as follows . in section  [ genfn ]",
    "we give a generating function for the @xmath48 and prove theorems  [ duality ] and  [ evenodd ] . in section  [ bounds ]",
    "we use this generating function to approximate the @xmath60 by trigonometric functions along the lower boundary arc of the fundamental domain and prove theorem  [ mainthm ] . in section  [ computations ]",

    "in this section , we prove theorem  [ duality ] and give a generating function for the basis elements @xmath48 and @xmath77 . we also prove theorem  [ evenodd ] .",
    "we rely heavily on a theorem of el - guindy  @xcite , which gives duality results and generating functions for modular forms in any level for which there exist modular forms of weights @xmath20 and @xmath37 with properties similar to that of the @xmath96 and the @xmath97 .",
    "ahlgren  @xcite proved that the levels given by the genus zero primes @xmath98 satisfy the appropriate properties , and el - guindy showed that they hold for prime levels @xmath99 for which the modular curve @xmath100 is hyperelliptic .",
    "we first note that the constant term of @xmath101 is given by @xmath102 .",

    "thus , the constant term of @xmath103 must be 0 , and we obtain the duality @xmath107 , proving theorem  [ duality ] .    to obtain a generating function for weight @xmath108 , we follow the proof of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.1 ) , replacing el - guindy s @xmath109 with the modular form @xmath110 and his @xmath111 with @xmath112 .",
    "the reader may verify that these forms satisfy the appropriate conditions for the argument .",

    "let @xmath124 be the unique modular form in @xmath0 that vanishes at the cusp 0 and has fourier expansion beginning @xmath125 , and let @xmath126 be the unique modular form in @xmath0 that vanishes at the cusp @xmath21 and has fourier expansion beginning @xmath125 .",
    "these forms may also be generated recursively in much the same way as the @xmath60 .",
    "el - guindy s theorem 1.2 , with @xmath127 , now gives a generating function @xmath128 note that the denominator of the generating function has not changed , since @xmath129 , and that a similar duality theorem between the coefficients of the @xmath130 and the @xmath131 may be obtained by a similar argument as above or via el - guindy s theorem .",
    "previously , atkinson  @xcite obtained this generating function in level @xmath2 for the the @xmath132 and the @xmath133 , but this is not quite sufficient to apply el - guindy s theorem and obtain generating functions for all weights .",

    "this approximation is good enough that to prove that most of the zeros must lie along this arc .",

    "when the argument inside the cosine function takes on a value of @xmath218 for @xmath219 , the cosine term will be @xmath220 .",

    "the valence formula predicts that @xmath225 has exactly @xmath30 zeros in the fundamental domain ; the pole of order @xmath61 at @xmath3 means that @xmath226 zeros remain .",
    "these must be simple and lie on the lower boundary if the weighted modular form is close enough to the cosine function .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to move the contour down far enough to capture all of the zeros on the bottom arc without picking up additional residues or increasing the difficulty of bounding the integral .",
    "we settle for showing that the majority of the zeros are on the arc by picking a contour of a fixed height that is low enough to capture most zeros , but not low enough to pick up extra images of @xmath188 under the action of @xmath4 .",

    "we pick the contour @xmath228 , which has a height of @xmath229 . fixing",
    "the height of the contour for @xmath182 means that we must also limit @xmath188 so that it does not cross below that height , giving a zero in the denominator .",

    "this restriction on @xmath217 also determines the number of zeros we can prove are on the arc .",
    "when @xmath233 , the term in the cosine function takes on the value @xmath234 ; when @xmath235 , this term takes on the value @xmath236 .",
    "we take the difference of these terms and find that @xmath237 zeros must lie on the arc .",

    "we do so by finding an upper bound for the absolute values of the derivatives of @xmath285 with respect to @xmath217 and @xmath286 with respect to @xmath182 .",

    "the derivative of @xmath245 with respect to @xmath217 is given by @xmath288 taking absolute values and again using derivatives of the geometric series , we find that @xmath289 which we calculate yields @xmath290    if we evaluate @xmath274 at the points @xmath291 for @xmath292 , the spacing between the points is small enough that on the entire interval , @xmath274 can not be below @xmath293 less than its minimum value on these points .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath294 on these points is at least @xmath295 and @xmath276 is negligible , so the smallest that @xmath274 can be on @xmath296 is @xmath297 .",
