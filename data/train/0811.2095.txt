    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are currently the most mature cosmological distance indicator which led to the discovery of the acceleration of the universe ( riess et a. 1998 ; perlmutter et al .",
    "their use as distance indicators relies on the well calibrated light curve characteristics , namely a phenomenological relation between the peak luminosity and the light curve width ( `` phillips relation '' or `` stretching factor '' ; phillips 1993 ; perlmutter et al . 1997 ; phillips et al .",
    "1999 ) .    by clarifying natures of progenitor system(s ) of sne ia ( livio 2000 : hillebrandt & niemeyer 2000 ; nomoto et al . 2003 )",
    ", one expects to obtain deep knowledge on the origin of the light curve relation for the better luminosity calibration , as well as new application of sne ia to a range of cosmological study . a progenitor of normal sne ia ( branch et al .",
    "1993 ; li et al .",
    "2001 ) is believed to be a white dwarf ( wd ) having nearly the chandrasekhar - mass .",
    "recently , a few sne ia have been suggested to have originated from a wd whose mass exceeds the chandrasekhar - mass of a non - rotating wd , raising a possibility that not all sne ia are from a single class of progenitor system .",
    "the suggestion mainly relies on their exceptionally large luminosity , which requires more than @xmath1 of @xmath0ni synthesized and ejected during the explosion .",
    "the thermonuclear explosion converts the initial wd compositions partly to @xmath0ni .",
    "@xmath2-rays from radioactive decay @xmath0ni @xmath3 @xmath0co @xmath3 @xmath0fe , through compton scatterings and thermalization , power the optical emission of sne ia .",
    "thus , the peak luminosity is closely related to the mass of @xmath0ni initially synthesized ( hereafter @xmath4 ) .    historically , the first observationally - based suggestion for the super - chandrasekhar wd explosion was made for sn ia 1991 t , as is summarized by lira et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and fisher et al .",
    "however , the distance to this sn has been actively debated , and the smaller value is now favored ( e.g. , saha et al . 2001 ) . as a result ,",
    "@xmath4 required to explain the peak bolometric luminosity has been reduced down ; for the reddening @xmath5 and the distance modulus @xmath6 as adopted by stritzinger et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the peak @xmath7-band magnitude is @xmath8 .",
    "stritzinger et al .",
    "( 2006 ) derived the mass of @xmath0ni , @xmath9 , based on the peak bolometric luminosity @xmath10 erg s@xmath11 .",
    "this amount of @xmath0ni could be marginally explained even by a chandrasekhar - mass model , although one may need an extreme , purely detonation - driven explosion ( khokhlov , mller , & hflich 1993 ) .",
    "the progress had to wait until a discovery of over - luminous sne ia , which require that @xmath12 .",
    "the first candidate , sn 2003fg ( snls-03d3bb ) , was reported by howell et al .",
    "the sn reached @xmath13 mag at peak and @xmath14 erg s@xmath11 . from this , howell et al .",
    "( 2006 ) estimated that @xmath15 , using an approximate relation between the peak luminosity and @xmath4 .",
    "since there should be other elements required both theoretically ( i.e. , all the well studied chandrasekhar - mass models do not produce more than @xmath1 of @xmath0ni ; khokhlov et al .",
    "1993 ; iwamoto et al .",
    "1999 ; rpke et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) and observationally ( i.e. , the maximum - light spectrum of sn 2003fg was dominated by intermediate mass elements ) , howell et al .",
    "( 2006 ) argued that sn 2003fg should come from a super - chandrasekhar - mass wd .",
    "two other over - luminous sne ia , thus candidates of the super - chandrasekhar - mass wd explosions , have been reported : sne ia 2006gz ( hicken et al .",
    "2007 ) and 2007if ( yuan et al . 2007 ) . for sn 2006gz ,",
    "hicken et al . (",
    "2007 ) adopted @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( but also see  2 ) , deriving @xmath18 at peak and @xmath19 erg s@xmath11 , and thus @xmath20(@xmath0ni ) @xmath21 .",
    "in addition to the large luminosity , they are unique also in their spectra .",
    "temporal sequence of the optical spectra of sn 2006gz is presented by hicken et al .",
    "they identified c ii @xmath224745 , 5490 , 6580 , and 7324 , in the spectra taken @xmath23 days before the maximum brightness , with the equivalent width reaching @xmath24  and at the velocity of @xmath25 km s@xmath11 .",
    "this is the strongest evidence for unburned carbon of any sne ia observed so far ( sn 1990n by leibundgut et al .",
    "1991 ; sn 2006d by thomas et al .",
    "adding to this , a si ii 6355  absorption velocity was unusually low well before the maximum ( @xmath26 km s@xmath11 at @xmath27 days before the maximum ) . without rapid decline observed in typical sne ia ( benetti et al .",
    "2005 ) , the si ii velocity at the maximum brightness settled down to @xmath28 km s@xmath11 , a value typical of normal sne ia . based on this unusually slow decline in the si ii velocity , hicken et al .",
    "( 2007 ) speculated that this might be a result of a dense unburned c+o envelope overlying a si - rich region ; the dense c+o envelope may be expected in the merger of two wds leading to the formation of the super - chandrasekhar - mass wd progenitor .",
    "howell et al .",
    "( 2006 ) also reported the probable detection of a c ii feature in the spectrum of sn 2003fg around the maximum brightness ; if pre - maximum spectra had been available , the c ii feature may have been in the spectra early on .",
    "these spectroscopic features suggest that the strong c ii and the slow evolution of si ii velocity may be a distinct feature of over - luminous sne ia . however , the spectral sequence is only available for sn 2006gz , and it has not been clarified to what extent these features are common in over - luminous sne ia .",
    "furthermore , it has not been clarified yet how these features , e.g. , the dense c+o envelope , are related to the progenitor system ( e.g. , see maeda et al .",
    "2008b for a caution of interpreting the c+o - rich region as an outcome of merging two wds ) .",
    "summarizing , the main argument for the super - chandrasekhar model is the large peak luminosity and the mass of @xmath0ni , with spectroscopic features only indicative .",
    "detailed study on observed characteristics of super - chandrasekhar - mass models is missing . clearly , the luminosity is not the only quantity that is dependent on the underlying models .",
    "the suggestion by howell et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , about the super - chandrasekhar - model for sn 2003fg , is actually based on another observed character , i.e. , the velocity of the expanding sn materials as deduced from its spectra .",
    "sn 2003fg showed exceptionally small velocity around the maximum brightness ( @xmath29 km s@xmath11 ) compare to that of normal sne ia ( @xmath30 km s@xmath11 ) . at the first look",
    ", this seems fully consistent with the expectation , since the super - chandrasekhar - mass wd provides the large binding energy , and thus the small kinetic energy per mass as compared to an explosion of a chandrasekhar - mass wd .",
    "jeffery , branch , and baron ( 2006 ) confirmed this statement on the relation between the wd mass and the velocity - scale .",
    "although the argument may sound satisfactory , it is not a whole story .",
    "studying emission processes should add further constraints on the underlying models .",
    "there are two over - luminous sne ia whose observed characteristics are available in the literature , i.e. , 2003fg and 2006gz .",
    "extensive observational data set for the moderately over - luminous sn 1991 t is also available . by examining these observations (  2 ) , we clarify that they have quite different properties .",
    "for example , sn 2006gz showed the velocity similar to normal sne ia - then , the argument for the super - chandrasekhar - mass model for sn 2006gz may be flawed .",
    "the aim of this paper is to examine if the observed characteristics can be explained by super - chandrasekhar - mass models , by means of radiation transfer calculations .",
    "we especially focus on sne 2003fg and 2006gz . in  3 , we describe sn ia models and summarize a method for the radiation transfer calculations .",
    "results based on an extensive set of model calculations are shown in  4 .",
    "discussion is given in  5 , where we examine uncertainties involved in our calculations .",
    "we also discuss the nature of these peculiar over - luminous sne ia .",
    "the emphasis is placed on our finding that not every observed characteristics can be interpreted within the context of the simple ( spherical ) super - chandrasekhar - mass wd models , and on our suggestion that the progenitor should largely deviate from spherical symmetry to account for the observed features ( at least for sn 2003fg ) .",
    "implications on sn 1991 t are also discussed .",
    "the paper is closed in  6 with concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , we summarize observed features relevant to this work , for sne 1991 t , 2003fg , and 2006gz .",
    "howell et al .",
    "( 2006 ) presented their observational data of sn ia 2003fg .",
    "the multi - band light curves are fitted well by @xmath31-corrected template light curves with the stretching factor ( perlmutter et al .",

    "the corresponding @xmath33 ( the magnitude change in the first 15 days past @xmath34 maximum : phillips 1993 ) is the following : @xmath35 , using equation ( 5 ) of perlmutter et al .",

    "<S> a few type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) have been suggested to be an explosion of a super - chandrasekhar - mass white dwarf ( wd ) to account for their large luminosities , requiring a large amount of @xmath0ni . </S>",
    "<S> however , the candidate over - luminous sne ia 2003fg , 2006gz , and ( moderately over - luminous ) sn 1991 t , have very different observational features : the characteristic time - scale and velocity are very different . we examine if and how the diversity can be explained , by 1d _ spherical _ radiation transport calculations covering a wide range of model parameters ( e.g. , wd mass ) . the observations of sn 2006gz are naturally explained by the super - chandrasekhar - mass model . </S>",

    "<S> the low velocity and short time - scale seen in sn 2003fg indicate that the ejecta mass is smaller than the chandrasekhar - mass , which is an apparent contradiction to the large luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the problem is solved if the progenitor wd , and thus the sn explosion , is aspherical . </S>",
    "<S> this may reflect a rapid rotation of the progenitor star , likely a consequence of the super - chandrasekhar - mass wd progenitor . </S>",
