    "the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) provided the first unbiased survey of the sky at mid and far - infrared wavelengths , giving us a comprehensive census of the infrared emission properties of galaxies in the local universe .",
    "the high luminosity tail of the infrared luminosity function can be approximated by a power - law ( l@xmath11 ) , which implies a space density for the most luminous infrared sources which is well in excess of what is found in the optical for local galaxies ( e.g. , schechter 1976 ) . at the highest luminosities , ultraluminous infrared galaxies , or ulirgs ( those galaxies with l@xmath12 ) have a space density that is a factor of @xmath13 higher than that of optically selected qsos , the only other known objects with comparable bolometric luminosities ( schmidt & green 1983 ) .",
    "multi - wavelength imaging surveys have shown that nearly all ulirgs are found in systems which have undergone strong tidal perturbations due to the merger of pairs of gas - rich disk galaxies ( armus et al .",
    "1987 ; sanders et al .",
    "1988a , b ; murphy et al .",
    "1996,2001a ) .",
    "they have enhanced star formation rates compared to non - interacting galaxies , and the fraction of sources with active galactic nuclei ( agn ) increases as a function of increasing @xmath14 ( armus , et al .",
    "1989 ; murphy et al . 1999,2001b ; veilleux et al . 1995,1997",
    "; kim et al . 1998 ) .",
    "ulirgs may represent an important evolutionary stage in the formation of qsos ( e.g. , sanders et al .",
    "1988a , b ) and perhaps powerful radio galaxies ( mazzarella et al .",
    "1993 ; evans et al . 2005 ) .",
    "in fact , numerical simulations have shown that tidal dissipation in mergers can be very effective in driving material from a gas - rich galaxy disk towards the nucleus , fueling a starburst and/or a nascent agn ( e.g. , barnes & hernquist 1992 ) .",
    "morphological and kinematic studies of ulirgs also suggest that their stellar populations are evolving into relaxed , elliptical - like distributions ( wright , et al .",
    "1990 ; genzel et al .",
    "2001 ; tacconi et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "luminous infrared galaxies , or lirgs ( those galaxies with l@xmath15 ) , are interesting phenomena in their own right , but they also may play a central role in our understanding of the general evolution of galaxies and black holes , as demonstrated by two key observational results .",
    "first , observations with iso and spitzer have shown that lirgs comprise a significant fraction ( @xmath16)of the cosmic infrared background and dominate the star - formation activity at @xmath17 ( elbaz et al .",
    "2002 ; le floch et al . 2005 ; caputi et al .",
    "2007 , magnelli et al . 2009 ) . in comparison to the local universe where they are relatively rare , ulirgs are about a thousand times more common at @xmath18 ( blain et al .",
    "2002 ; chapman et al .",
    "second , the ubiquity of super - massive nuclear black holes in quiescent galaxies and the scaling of their masses with stellar bulge masses ( magorrian et al . 1998 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al . 2000 ) suggest an intimate connection between the evolution of massive galaxies and their central black holes .",
    "one explanation for the relationship is that mass accretion onto the black hole occurs during episodes of nuclear star formation .",
    "the study of a large , complete sample of local lirgs spanning all merger and interaction stages can shed critical light on the co - evolution of black holes and stellar bulges in massive galaxies .",
    "the great observatories all - sky lirg survey ( goals ) combines data from nasa s spitzer , hubble , chandra and galex observatories in a comprehensive imaging and spectroscopic survey of over 200 low redshift ( @xmath1 ) lirgs ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the primary new data sets consist of spitzer irac and mips imaging , irs spectroscopy , hst acs , nicmos , and wfpc2 imaging , chandra acis imaging , and galex far and near - uv observations .",
    "the majority of the new observations are being led by goals team members , but we also make use of the spitzer , hst , chandra and galex archives to fill out the sample data ( see table 2 ) . in addition ,",
    "optical and k - band imaging ( ishida et al . 2004 ) , optical spectra ( kim et al . 1995 ) , j , h , and ks - band near - infrared images from 2mass ( skrutskie et al . 2006 ) , sub - millimeter images ( dunne et al . 2000 ) , co and hcn ( sanders , scoville & soifer 1991 ; gao & solomon 2004 ) , and 20 cm vla imaging ( condon et al . 1990 ) exist for various sub - sets of the lirgs in goals , besides the iras data with which the sources were selected ( sanders et al . 2003 ) . in this paper",
    "we introduce the main components of the survey , present our primary science objectives , and discuss the multi - wavelength results for one source , vv 340 .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "the scientific objectives are discussed in section 2 , followed by a definition of the sample in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we describe the observations , in section 5 we outline the spitzer legacy data products being delivered , and in section 6 we present results for the lirg vv 340 .",
    "while a great deal of effort has been devoted to the study of ulirgs , lirgs have , in comparison , suffered from a lack of attention .",
    "ground - based optical and near infrared imaging studies of low - redshift lirgs have been performed ( e.g. , ishida 2004 ) , but multi - wavelength imaging and spectroscopic surveys of a large sample of the nearest and brightest lirgs have not been completed .",
    "this is undoubtedly due to the fact that lirgs form a morphologically diverse group of galaxies , unlike ulirgs which are nearly always involved in the final stages of a violent and spectacular merger .",
    "lirgs are also much harder to detect and analyze at high redshift in many shallow surveys , which has traditionally removed much of the impetus behind establishing a robust library of low - redshift analogs .",
    "this has changed recently , with surveys such as cosmos ( scoville et al . 2007 ) and goods ( dickinson et al . 2003 ) , which include significant samples of lirgs at cosmologically interesting epochs .",
    "an important question regarding the nature of lirgs , is what is the source of their power ?",
    "what mechanism is responsible for generating energy at a rate that is tens to hundreds of times larger than emitted by a typical galaxy ?",
    "interactions between large , late - type galaxies are evident in many systems , but a significant fraction of lirgs show no morphological evidence ( e.g. , double nuclei , tidal tails or stellar bridges , etc . ) for a major merger .",
    "large molecular gas masses , large gas fractions , or unusual dynamics may all play a role .",
    "regardless of the trigger , an agn or an intense starburst is often invoked as the most likely source of the energy in lirgs .",
    "the relative importance of agn and starburst activity within individual systems , for the generation of far - infrared radiation from lirgs as a class , and how the dominant energy source changes as a function of merger stage are all important questions that can only be answered by studying a large , unbiased sample at a wide variety of wavelengths .",
    "this is the primary motivation behind the goals project .    by their very nature ,",
    "lirgs are dusty galaxies , wherein a large fraction ( over 90% for the most luminous systems ) of the uv light emitted by stars and/or agn is absorbed by grains and re - radiated in the far - infrared .",
    "this makes traditonal , uv and optical spectroscopic techniques for detecting and measuring starbursts and agn ( e.g. , emission line ratios and linewidths ) difficult to link quantitatively to the ultimate source of the ir emission .",
    "however , by combining these data with observations in the infrared , hard x - ray , and radio , it is possible to penetrate the dust and better understand the lirg engine .    with the iras data we have been able to construct unbiased , flux - limited samples of lirgs and",
    "measure their global far - infrared colors , albeit with little or no information about the distribution of the dust , due to the large iras beam sizes .",
    "the overall lirg spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are shaped by the relative locations of the dust and the young stars , as well as the presence of an active nucleus . at a basic level",
    ", the size of the warm dust emiting region can give an indication of the power source , since a starburst will be spread out on kpc scales while the region heated by an agn will be @xmath19 orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "spitzer imaging with irac and mips can give us our first estimates of the size of the ir - emitting regions in the nearest lirgs , although higher spatial resolution is required for the vast majority of systems if we are to place meaningful constraints on , for example , the luminosity density of the nuclear starburst .",
    "ground - based @xmath20 m imaging can provide a high spatial resolution view of the nucleus , but these wavelengths are most sensitive to the hottest dust , and extrapolations to the far - infrared are always required .",
    "the irac data provides the finest spatial resolution on spitzer , and since the irac bands for low - redshift galaxies are dominated by stars , hot dust , and finally pah emission as one progresses from @xmath21 m to @xmath22 m , the nuclear colors themselves can indicate the presence of an agn ( lacy et al .",
    "2004 ; stern et al .",
    "although the spatial resolution of the mips data is limited , the flux ratios give an indication of the dust temperature and hence , the importance of an agn to the overall energy budget . when coupled with the radio continuum data , the mips fluxes",
    "can also be used to estimate the radio  far - infrared flux ratio , itself an indicator of the presence of a ( radio loud ) agn .",
    "mid - infrared and x - ray spectroscopy provide powerful tools for not only uncovering buried agn , but also measuring the physical properties of the gas and dust surrounding the central source .",
    "the low - resolution irs spectra are ideal for measuring the broad pah features at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 , and @xmath23 m , the silicate absorption features at 9.7 and @xmath24 m , and water or hydrocarbon ices at @xmath25 m ( e.g. , spoon et al . 2004 ; armus et al .",
    "the pah ratios indicate the size and ionization state of the small grains ( e.g. , draine & li 2001 ) , while the silicate absorption gives a direct measure of the optical depth towards the nuclei and clues as to the geometry of the obscuring medium ( e.g. levenson et al . 2007 , sirocky et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the ratio of the pah emission to the underlying ( hot dust ) continuum can be used as a measure of the strength of an agn , since seyert galaxies and quasars typically have extremely low pah equivalent widths ( eqw ) compared to starburst galaxies ( genzel et al .",
    "1998 ; sturm et al .",
    "2002 , armus et al .",
    "2004,2006,2007 ) . among ulirgs",
    ", the pah eqw have even been shown to decrease with increasing luminosity ( tran et al .",
    "2001 ; desai et al .",
    "2007 ) suggesting an increasing importance of an agn in the highest luminosity systems .",
    "since the strengths of the pah features can dominate broad - band , mid - infrared filter photometry , it is critical to understand how the relative strengths of the pah features vary within the lirg population and how they affect the colors with redshift ( see armus et al .",
    "in addition , the shape of the silicate absorption can indicate the presence of crystalline silicates , themselves a clear sign of violent , and recent , grain processing ( e.g. , spoon et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the high - resolution irs spectra are ideally suited for measuring the equivalent widths and relative line strengths of the narrow , fine - structure atomic emission lines such as [ s iv ] @xmath26 m , [ ne ii ] @xmath27 m , [ ne iii ] @xmath28 m , [ ne v ] 14.3 and @xmath29 m , [ o iv ] @xmath30 m , [ s iii ] 18.7 and @xmath31 m , [ si ii ] @xmath32 m , [ fe ii ] 17.9 and @xmath30 m , as well as the pure rotational h@xmath33 lines at @xmath34 m , @xmath35 m , @xmath36 m and @xmath37 m . these lines provide a sensitive measure of the ionization state and density of the gas , and they can be also used to infer the basic properties ( e.g. , t@xmath38 ) of the young stellar population . the h@xmath33 lines probe the warm ( 100 - 500 k ) molecular gas and , when combined with measurements of the cold molecular gas via the mm co line , can be used to infer the warm - to - cold molecular gas fraction as a function of evolutionary state ( e.g. higdon et al .",
    "the high resolution spectra can also indicate the presence of a warm , interstellar medium , via absorption features of c@xmath33h@xmath33 and hcn at @xmath39 m and @xmath40 m , respectively ( see lahuis et al .",
    "2007 ) .    the low background of the acis detector ,",
    "together with the excellent spatial resolution of chandra , provide an unprecedented view of the @xmath41 kev x - ray emission in lirgs .",
    "x - ray binaries , an agn , and hot gas associated with an outflowing wind can all contribute to the measured x - ray emission on different physical scales and at different characteristic energies .",
    "the x - ray images will allow us to quantify the amount and extent of resolved x - ray emission in lirgs as an indication of extent of the starburst , and/or the presence of an outflowing wind .",
    "the winds are driven through the combined action of overlapping supernovae , producing both a hot central component and soft , extended emission , made up predominantly of shocked , swept - up gas in the ism ( e.g. , fabbiano , heckman & keel 1990 ; heckman et al .",
    "1990 ; armus et al .",
    "1995 ; read , ponman & strickland 1997 ; dahlem , weaver & heckman 1998 ; strickland et al .",
    "2004a , b ) .",
    "an agn , on the other hand , will produce unresolved hard x - ray emission , sometimes accompanied by a strong neutral or ionized iron line .",
    "the penetrating power of the hard x - rays implies that even obscured agn should be visible to chandra ( e.g. , komossa et al .",
    "unresolved , hard x - ray ( @xmath42 kev ) flux with strong iron line emission is a clear indication of an agn , and by fitting the spectrum we can derive both the intrinsic luminosity and the hi column toward the accretion disk(s ) .",
    "of course , identifying the true nature of the nuclear emission from the chandra spectra alone is difficult for sources where the hi column density exceeds @xmath43@xmath8 , but the combination of x - ray spectral and spatial information can help disentangle the extended starburst emission from the unresolved , harder emission from an agn in many lirgs . of particular interest among the lirg sample is whether or not the x - ray luminosity can be used as a quantitative measure of the star formation rate . in galaxies dominated by star formation , where the x - ray emission is dominated by high - mass x - ray binaries",
    ", there is a correlation between the x - ray luminosity and the star formation rate as measured by the infrared or radio emission ( ranalli et al . 2003 ; grimm et al . 2003 ) .",
    "it will be interesting to determine whether or not this relation holds for the powerful starbursts found in lirgs .",
    "the radio emission from galaxies is immune to the effects of dust obscuration , and the far - infrared to radio flux ratio , @xmath44 ( helou et al .",
    "1985 ) , shows a tight correlation for star - forming galaxies ( yun , reddy & condon 2001 ) .",
    "in addition , the radio spectral index and the radio morphology can be used to identify buried agn and/or jets in the nuclei of lirgs at the high spatial resolution afforded with the vla . the available ghz radio data for the goals sample ( condon et al . 1990 )",
    "will therefore provide a critical baseline for understanding the power sources and the ism properties of the goals sample .",
    "in particular , it will be valuable to compare the radio and far - infrared morphologies of the nearest lirgs and explore the far - infrared  radio correlation in detail within luminous infrared galaxies , such has been done for other nearby samples ( e.g. , murphy et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "in addition to uncovering buried agn and nuclear starbursts in lirgs , goals provides an excellent opportunity to study star - formation in lirg disks as a function of merger stage .",
    "the wide wavelength coverage and sensitivity provide a detailed look at the old and young stars , the dust , and the gas across the merger sequence .",
    "goals will allow us to answer some important questions about galactic mergers , such as , what fraction of the star - formation occurs in in extra - nuclear ( super ) star clusters ? can the ages and locations of these clusters be used to reconstruct the merger history and refine detailed models of the merger process and what are the physical processes that drive star - formation on different scales in the merger ? a simple question that still needs to be addressed is the range in uv properties of lirgs .",
    "are lirgs as a class , weak or strong uv emitters ? how much of the ionizing flux emerges , and is the ratio of ir to uv emission related to any of the other properties , e.g. the merger state or the distribution of the dust ?",
    "galex has provided our first look at the properties of large numbers of uv - selected starburst and agn as a function of cosmic epoch ( e.g. , gil de paz , et al .",
    "2007 ; xu , et al . 2007",
    "; martin , et al . 2007 ; schiminovich , et al .",
    "2007 ) . by combining the galex and spitzer data",
    ", we will be able to make a full accounting of the energy balance throughout the goals sample , relating the uv emission to the infrared photometric and spectroscopic properties of a complete sample of low - redshift lirgs . in the goals targets that are resolved by galex ( a small but important sub - sample )",
    ", we will be able to separate the nucleus and disk in single systems , and the individual galaxies in interacting systems , in order to measure the relative uv emission escaping from the systems and directly compare this to the far - infrared emission measured with spitzer .",
    "this will provide a detailed look at the variation in the ir to uv ratio within interacting galaxies at all stages .",
    "the hst imaging data in goals provides our sharpest look at the stellar clusters and detailed morphological features in lirgs .",
    "the depth and high spatial resolution of the hst imaging with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) wide field camera ( wfc ) allows for a sensitive search for faint remnants of past , or less - disruptive ( minor ) mergers ( e.g. , shells , fading tails , etc . ) , small scale nuclear bars , and even close , double nuclei , although the latter are notoriously difficult to measure at optical wavelengths in heavily obscured systems . these data will be used to fit models of galaxy surface brightness profiles with standard programs ( e.g. , galfit ) and estimate basic structural parameters ( e.g. bulge to disk ratio , half - light radius ) for the lirgs as a class , and as a function of nuclear properties ( e.g. , agn or starburst dominated spectra as determined from the spitzer irs and chandra data ) .",
    "the sub - arcsec resolution of the acs also allows a sensitive search for and quantitative measurement of the young , star - forming clusters in lirgs .",
    "the cluster populations can be placed on color magnitude diagrams in order to estimate their ages , and the number and luminosity of such systems can be studied as a function of the relative age of the merger .",
    "particularly powerful in studying the cluster ages will be the combination of visual and uv imaging with acs ( the latter obtained with the solar blind channel , sbc ) since the colors will then allow us to break the age - reddening degeneracy over a large range in cluster ages ( @xmath45 yrs ) .",
    "the cluster results can then be compared to models of the interaction , as has been done in some well - studied mergers ( e.g. , ngc 4038/9  whitmore & schweizer 1995 ; whitmore , et al .",
    "2005,2007 ; mengel , et al .",
    "2001,2005 ) .",
    "for example , it has recently been shown that while the interacting lirg ngc 2623 posesses a large number of young star clusters that probably formed in the interaction , they account for a negligible fraction ( @xmath46 ) of the bolometric luminosity ( evans et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "our understanding of the uv emission properties of lirgs will be greatly enhanced by the addition of the high - resolution acs far - uv imaging data .",
    "only a handful of lirgs have been imaged in the vacuum ultraviolet at high resolution ( e.g. goldader et al .",
    "although the study of the cluster populations is the primary scientific goal for the acs imaging , they will be extremely valuable for understanding the physical conditions that drive luminous infrared galaxies away from the well - known irx-@xmath47 correlation - the correlation between infrared excess and uv spectral slope ( see meurer et al .",
    "1999 ; goldader et al .",
    "ulirgs fall well off the correlation established for starburst galaxies , and this is usually interpreted simply as disconnect between the sources of the observed uv and far - infrared emission caused by dust obscuration .",
    "however , the physical conditions over which this occurs , and when this sets in during the merger process is not known . by combining the acs , galex and spitzer imaging data",
    ", we will be able to greatly extend the luminosity range over which the uv ( and ir ) emission has been mapped , as well as sample galaxies along the merger sequence .",
    "to understand the true stellar distribution in the dusty circumnuclear regions in lirgs , it is important to combine high resolution and long - wavelength imaging .",
    "the sub - arcsecond hst nicmos imaging in goals will provide us with our clearest picture of the stellar mass in the lirg nuclei , and allow us to accurately de - redden the stellar clusters seen in the acs data . with these data we will be able to search for very small scale , extremely red point sources which may be buried agn , and find secondary nuclei hidden from even the deepest acs optical observations .",
    "in addition , we will be able to find optically faint or even invisible clusters around the nuclei , and together with the acs data , assemble a true cluster luminosity function unaffected by dust .",
    "the h - band imaging provides us with the best ( existing ) near - infrared imaging resolution , and it samples the peak in the stellar light curve for the old stars which will dominate the mass in these galaxies . while the nicmos f160w and the irac @xmath21 m data are both effective tracers of the old stars and stellar mass , the nicmos data have a spatial resolution which is an order of magnitude higher - on the order of 100 pc or better for many of the lirgs . by combining the irac imaging of the entire sample with the nicmos imaging of the luminous goals systems",
    ", we will be able to trace the stellar masses from the largest to the smallest scales .",
    "a basic result from the spitzer imaging in goals will be a much better understanding of the distribution of the dust in mergers .",
    "since many of the lirgs are interacting , yet not fully merged , the irac and mips images allow us to separate the contribution from each galaxy to the total far - infrared flux as measured by iras .",
    "they also allow us to separate nuclear from disk emission in many systems , pinpointing the location of the enhanced infrared luminosity as a function of merger state .",
    "the mips images provide a clean separation between the warm dust ( t@xmath48k ) at @xmath49 m and @xmath50 m , and the cold dust , which contributes most at @xmath51 m .",
    "one of the most remarkable results from iso was the discovery that most of the far - infrared emission in the merging galaxy ngc 4038/9 ( the antennae ) originates from the disk overlap region which is extremely faint in the uv and optical ( mirabel et al .",
    "the spitzer goals images will allow us to find other systems like the antennae , and determine the frequency of this completely dust - enshrouded starburst state among the lirg population as a whole .",
    "taken together , the imaging and spectroscopic data in goals will provide the most comprehensive look at the lirg population in the local universe . by studying lirgs from the x - ray through the radio and far - infrared ,",
    "we can piece together an understanding of the stars , central black holes , and the interstellar - medium in some of the most actively evolving galaxies today .",
    "these observations will be invaluable as a local library with which to interpret the limited photometric and spectroscopic information garnered from deep surveys of lirgs at high - redshift , providing an in - depth glimpse of the co - evolution of starbursts and black holes at late times , and the role of feedback on the ism of merging galaxies .",
    "the iras revised bright galaxy sample ( rbgs ; sanders et al .",
    "2003 ) is a complete sample of extragalactic objects with iras @xmath52 jy , covering the full sky above a galactic latitude of @xmath53 degrees .",
    "the rbgs objects are the brightest 60-micron sources in the extragalactic sky , and as such they are the best sources for studying the far - infrared emission processes in galaxies and for comparing them with observations at other wavelengths .",
    "the 629 objects in the rbgs all have @xmath1 , and near - infrared properties spanning a wide range from normal , isolated gas - rich spirals at low luminosities ( l@xmath54 ) through an increasing fraction of interacting galaxy pairs and ongoing mergers among the more luminous lirgs and ulirgs .",
    "the sample includes numerous galaxies with optical nuclear spectra classified as starbursts , type 1 and 2 seyfert nuclei , and liners .",
    "the 21 ulirgs ( 3% ) and 181 lirgs ( 29% ) in the rbgs form a large , statiscally complete sample of 202 infrared luminous , local galaxies which are excellent analogs for comparisons with infrared and sub - mm selected galaxies at high redshift .",
    "these infrared - luminous sources define a set of galaxies sufficiently large to sample each stage of interaction and provide a temporal picture of the merger process and it s link to the generation of far - infrared radiation .",
    "the full sample of lirgs , along with their basic properties , is listed in table 1 .",

    "<S> the lirgs are a complete subset of the iras revised bright galaxy sample ( rbgs ) , which comprises 629 extragalactic objects with @xmath2 m flux densities above 5.24 jy , and galactic latitudes above five degrees . </S>",
    "<S> the lirgs targeted in goals span the full range of nuclear spectral types defined via traditional optical line - ratio diagrams ( type-1 and type-2 agn , liners , and starbursts ) as well as interaction stages ( major mergers , minor mergers , and isolated galaxies ) . </S>",
    "<S> they provide an unbiased picture of the processes responsible for enhanced infrared emission in galaxies in the local universe . as an example of the analytic power of the multi - wavelength goals </S>",
    "<S> dataset , we present spitzer , chandra , hubble and galex images and spectra for the interacting system vv 340 ( iras f14547 + 2449 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spitzer mips imaging data indicates that between @xmath3% of the total far - infrared emission ( or about @xmath4l@xmath5 ) originates in vv 340 north . </S>",
    "<S> while the spitzer irac colors of vv 340 north and south are consistent with star - forming galaxies , both the spitzer irs and chandra acis data indicate the presence of an agn in vv 340 north . </S>",
    "<S> the observed line fluxes , without correction for extinction , imply the agn accounts for less than @xmath6% of the observed infrared emission . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray data are consistent with a heavily absorbed ( n@xmath7@xmath8 ) agn . </S>",
    "<S> the galex far and near - uv fluxes imply a extremely large infrared  excess \" ( irx ) for the system ( f@xmath9/f@xmath10 ) which is well above the correlation seen in starburst galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> most of this excess is driven by vv 340 n , which has an ir excess of nearly 400 . </S>",
    "<S> the vv 340 system seems to be comprised of two very different galaxies  an infrared luminous edge - on galaxy ( vv 340 north ) that dominates the long - wavelength emission from the system and which hosts a buried agn , and a face - on starburst ( vv 340 south ) that dominates the short - wavelength emission . </S>"
