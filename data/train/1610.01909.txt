    "even after the discovery of the higgs boson at lhc , understanding the origin of smallness associated with neutrino mass still remains an open question . in this respect seesaw mechanism",
    "serves as a guiding tool hinting toward the existence of new physics beyond the electroweak scale ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the conventional type - i seesaw  @xcite tries to explain the smallness of neutrino mass by adding three right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos @xmath6 to the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "they have majorana mass @xmath7 which is representative of the lepton number violation . with the yukawa couplings of order unity , the left handed neutrinos can be light enough , @xmath8 , provided",
    "the new physics scale @xmath7 is sufficiently high @xmath9 gev or so .",
    "though it suggests an interesting and natural explanation of why neutrinos are so light , such a high new physics scale is beyond the reach of present and future neutrino experiments .",
    "inverse seesaw  @xcite on the other hand turns out to be a viable alternate scenario where the new physics scale responsible for neutrino mass generation can be brought down near tev scale at the expense of involving additional fields ( sm singlet fermions @xmath10 ) . in presence of additional symmetry like a global @xmath11 , the corresponding neutral lepton @xmath12 mass matrix takes the form @xmath13 using the basis @xmath14 . note that at this level , neutrinos are massless . once the lepton number violating term @xmath15 is introduced with @xmath16 , the effective @xmath17 light neutrino mass matrix is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "since the lepton number turns out to be only an approximate symmetry of nature , it is perhaps more natural to be broken by a small amount @xmath20 rather than by a large mass @xmath7 as happened in case of type - i seesaw .",
    "also note that the other mass scale @xmath21 ( say the new physics scale ) in eq .",
    "( [ cm ] ) can be as low as tev since there exists a double suppression by this new physics scale through eq.([mnudef ] ) and smallness of @xmath20 is then justified to produce correct amount of light neutrino mass .    apart from the smallness associated with the neutrino mass , the origin of lepton mixing matrix , being quite different from the quark mixing , needs to be understood .",
    "the study of underlying principle behind this typical mixing is particularly interesting with the recent finding of nonzero @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the present global analysis @xcite from several experimental data @xcite can be summarized as    @xmath22 , @xmath23 , + @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 .    in this regard , a particular pattern yielding @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    "is called the tri - bimaximal mixing ( tbm )  @xcite .",
    "it has received a lot of attention as such a pattern can be elegantly generated using flavor symmetries .",
    "use of non - abelian discrete symmetries ( for a review see  @xcite ) like @xmath29 etc .",
    "is very well known  @xcite in this context .",
    "however a deformation from tbm mixing becomes essential after the precise measurement of @xmath1 .",
    "the details of such deformation are studied for type - i  @xcite and type - ii seesaw   @xcite in the context of @xmath0 . in general , flavon fields (",
    "sm singlet scalar fields transforming non - trivially under the flavor symmetry ) are employed for this approach .",
    "once these fields get their vacuum expectation values ( vev ) , the flavor structure is generated .    in this work",
    "we aim to study the lepton mixing matrix in the inverse seesaw framework based on an @xmath0 flavor symmetry . in its minimal form ,",
    "ref @xcite discusses how a tbm pattern can be incorporated in an @xmath0 symmetric inverse seesaw scenario .",
    "they have shown ( among one of the few possibilities discussed there ) that if @xmath30 and @xmath20 matrices all posses the following structure : @xmath31 the light neutrino mass matrix obtains a typical form , @xcite @xmath32 the diagonalizing matrix of @xmath33 is representative of the tbm mixing in the basis where charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal . in @xcite , authors have shown that in a @xmath34 based inverse seesaw , nonzero @xmath1 can be generated from the correction in the charged lepton sector .",
    "few earlier attempts in realizing inverse seesaw in the framework of discrete flavour symmetries can be found in  @xcite . here",
    "the construction is such that the charged lepton mass matrix becomes diagonal . with a simpler form for @xmath35 and @xmath21 ( where @xmath36 and @xmath37 in @xmath38 ) , the structure of @xmath20 matrix is found to be same as @xmath38",
    "this would generate the tbm pattern of lepton mixing matrix .",
    "therefore we finally adopt a @xmath20 matrix different from @xmath38 structure so as to accommodate the observed value of @xmath1 .",
    "we have discussed the possible correlation between the dirac cp phase ( @xmath2 ) with @xmath1 and other parameters involved .",
    "we have tried to address the smallness associated with the @xmath20 term by considering its origin from a higher dimensional operator . the @xmath0 symmetry along with other non - abelian discrete symmetries like @xmath39 play important role .",
    "we have estimated the effective neutrino mass parameter associated with neutrinoless double beta decay and studied the correlation with @xmath2 as well .",
    "furthermore @xmath35 being close to @xmath21 , in general the inverse seesaw framework allows non - negligible mixing between the light and heavy neutrino states resulting non - unitarity contributions to the lepton flavor mixing . since the flavor structure",
    "is completely known in our framework , we are then able to study the non - unitarity involved in the set - up and in turn constrain some of the parameters .",
    "lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) decays also result from this non - unitarity effect .",
    "however it turns out in our scenario that branching ratio of those lfv decays are vanishingly small due to exact cancellation of elements involved followed from the particular flavour structure we have considered .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the section 2 below ,",
    "we describe the construction of the model based on the symmetries of the framework .",
    "the detailed phenomenology constraining the parameters of the model from the available data of neutrino experiments takes place in section 3 and 4 .",
    "section 5 is devoted in studying the non - unitarity effect and we comment on lepton flavor violating decays and additional contribution to neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "finally we conclude in section 6 .",
    "in order to realize the usual inverse seesaw mechanism for the generation of light neutrino masses , we extend he sm particle content by introducing three rh neutrinos , @xmath40 , and three other singlet fermions , @xmath10 as already mentioned .",
    "in addition few flavons ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) are included to understand the flavor structure of the lepton mixing .",
    "an additional global @xmath11 symmetry is considered along with the flavor symmetry @xmath46 .",

    "this is an artifact of the special flavor structure of the @xmath67 .",
    "below we try to argue naively why this scenario predicts vanishingly small branching ratio for lfv decays .",

    "hence the form of @xmath266 can be considered as @xmath303 . since we know the form of @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( dictated by flavour symmetry ) , we try to find the form of @xmath200 and it takes an approximate form as @xmath304 where we have kept the terms in first order in @xmath300 only .",

    "it is elaborated in appendix .",
    "it then turns out that @xmath308 and hence @xmath309 indicating that lfv branching ratios would be zero upto order @xmath300 .",
    "note that the loop factor @xmath310 in eq .",
    "[ br ] can be taken outside the summation as a common factor since we have six almost degenerate rh neutrinos followed after diagonalizing @xmath202 and considering @xmath311 .",
    "usually it is expected that @xmath312 and hence lfv can have a sizable magnitude .",
    "however here due to specific structure of @xmath202 , the leading order contribution is cancelled out while terms upto order @xmath300 is considered .",
    "we note that in addition to the standard contribution to the effective mass parameter involved in neutrinoless double beta decay as described in section [ sec3 ] , there will be additional contribution due the presence of mixing between light and heavy neutrinos ( @xmath107 with nonzero @xmath313 ) .",
    "hence the half life associated with neutrinoless double beta can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath314 where @xmath315 is the phase space factor and @xmath316 mev@xmath317  @xcite .",
    "here @xmath318 is the mass of electron , @xmath319 is the mass of proton , @xmath320 is the nuclear matrix element for light neutrino states and @xmath321 is nuclear matrix element for heavy neutrino states . here",
    "the first and second contribution in eq .",
    "( [ half - life ] ) is due to the light and heavy neutrinos respectively .",
    "we already have an estimate for the first contribution ( with @xmath322 ) as provided in several tables of section 4 , which turns out to be of order @xmath323 ev . now with some specific choice of @xmath228 and @xmath292",
    ", we can determine the @xmath205 matrix numerically as discussed in the previous subsection where information on other parameters @xmath324 are taken from section 4 ( different cases ) .",

    ", we consider lowest value of @xmath223 which is allowed from eq .",
    "( [ vflimit ] ) .",
    "it turns out then that the second contribution remains sub - dominant ( @xmath326 ev or less ) compared to the first contribution of eq .",
    "( [ half - life ] ) .",
    "the smallness of the second term can also be understood from our finding for @xmath266 as @xmath327 . a naive estimate for this contribution ( to @xmath328 )",
    "therefore is of order @xmath329 .",
    "the using the lowest possible @xmath223 consistent with eq .",
    "( [ vflimit ] ) , the estimate indicates that this contribution is essentially small compared to the first contribution .",
    "so the effective mass involved in the neutrinoless double beta decay process is mostly unaffected with the presence of heavy neutrinos in the present set - up .",
    "we have considered an inverse seesaw framework embedded in a flavor symmetric environment in order to study whether it can accommodate the neutrino masses and mixing as suggested from present experimental data , particularly in view of nonzero @xmath1 .",
    "we employ an @xmath330 discrete symmetry which is concocted with a global @xmath331 symmetry .",
    "we note that the flavor structure of light neutrino mass matrix is essentially dictated by that of the @xmath20 matrix itself , which is the matrix containing the lepton number breaking contribution in the inverse seesaw scenario .",
    "the flavor structure of @xmath20 matrix is generated when the flavons have vevs .",
    "we notice that the typical structure of this matrix can lead to a lepton mixing consistent with neutrino data where the charged lepton mass matrix is found to be diagonal in the framework . in doing this analysis ,",
    "we have studied the correlation between different parameters of the model and their dependence on the neutrino parameters such as mass - squared differences , mixing angles etc .",
    ", evaluated from experimental results . dependency on the dirac",
    "cp violating phase is also studied .",
    "since there exists a small mixing between light and heavy neutrino states in the framework , we have also checked the non - unitarity effects in our set - up which contribute to lfv processes , neutrinoless double beta decay etc .. we have found that owing to the typical flavor structure of the neutrino mass matrix here , the effective contribution of it to the lfv processes and neutrinoless double beta decays are vanishingly small .",
    "it can be noted that the @xmath20 matrix results from the breaking of a flavon which carries charge under the global @xmath11 .",
    "hence we expect to have goldstone boson or majoron ( @xmath332 ) @xcite .",
    "it may open higgs boson decay channel ( @xmath333 ) and demands extensive analysis in the context of current and future lhc data .",
    "discussions in this direction can be found in  @xcite .",
    "particularly current 13 tev run of lhc will be important for such analysis .",
    "however further discussion in this regard is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "the @xmath202 matrix can be block diagonalized by a matrix @xmath334 as @xmath335 where @xmath334 is given by ( in our scenario both @xmath20 and @xmath21 are symmetric matrices ) @xmath336 where we have neglected the terms involving higher orders in @xmath300 .",
    "now , the upper @xmath337 and lower @xmath338 blocks matrices of @xmath339 carry the form of @xmath20 matrix itself ( or @xmath33 ) once we redefine the parameter @xmath340 by @xmath341 ( see eq .",
    "( [ md - m ] ) and ( [ mumatrix ] ) ) .",
    "therefore we can follow the similar prescription for diagonalizing these blocks as we did in case of @xmath33 diagonalization",
    ". hence @xmath339 can be diagonalized by @xmath342 with @xmath343 where @xmath305 has the form similar to @xmath81 , @xmath107 @xmath344 therefore the diagonalizing matrix of @xmath202 can be written as @xmath345 with @xmath303 , we get        100 p.  minkowski , phys .",
