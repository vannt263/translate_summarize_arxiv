    "the quantum and classical fluctuations of the electromagnetic field are at the origin of several physical phenomena such as the existence of a force , even in vacuum ( the ground state of electromagnetic field ) , between any couple of polarizable bodies .",
    "this effect , usually known as casimir - lifshitz effect between macroscopic bodies and casimir - polder force when one or more atoms are involved , was first theoretically predicted in 1948 by casimir and polder @xcite for ideal reflecting bodies at @xmath0 , and later extended to real bodies at non - zero temperature by dzyaloshinskii , lifshitz , and pitaevskii @xcite .",
    "recently their predictions have been experimentally verified for several different geometrical configurations @xcite .",
    "while these forces have been typically studied at thermal equilibrium , it was shown in 2005 that systems out of thermal equilibrium show indeed new qualitative features , such as a strong tunability of the force and the possibility of switching from an attractive to a repulsive behavior @xcite .",
    "these theoretical predictions were at the origin of the first measurement of the temperature dependence of casimir force @xcite by using a bec of rubidium atoms as a micro - mechanical sensor of force @xcite .",
    "these results triggered a new interest in the study of casimir interactions in several different non - equilibrium scenarios including both body - body @xcite and atom - body @xcite configurations .",
    "the absence of thermal equilibrium is at the origin of a more familiar physical phenomenon also originating from the electromagnetic field fluctuations , namely the radiative heat transfer @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this effect shares a close theoretical formalism with casimir - lifshitz forces , and has also been recently experimentally assessed in different geometries @xcite .    in last years , a number of theories have been developed to describe casimir force and heat transfer out of thermal equilibrium between bodies with arbitrary geometries and dielectric properties @xcite .",
    "these theories are based on different approaches ( such as scattering matrices , green s functions and fluctuating surface currents ) but all share the use of flucutation - dissipation theorem as the main tool to describe the correlations of the electromagnetic field radiated by each body out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "some of these theories @xcite have been presented in a general way in order to be able to deal with the general problem of an arbitrary number of bodies .",
    "nevertheless , closed form expressions and numerical applications have been presented only for two interacting bodies .",
    "non - equilibrium studies dealt also with several applications , as for the case of the heat transfer between two nanogratings @xcite . more recently",
    ", the absence of equilibrium has been proposed as a tool to manipulate the quantum state of an atom when placed in proximity of a body , realizing a new cooling mechanism and the inversion of the atomic populations @xcite .",
    "it has been also suggested to exploit non - equilibrium configurations to produce and protect steady entanglement for two quits @xcite .",
    "the heat transfer in configurations involving more than two bodies has been also investigated : heat transfer for three nanoparticles in the dipole approximation @xcite , the time - dependent heating and cooling in a system of an arbitrary number of dipoles in @xcite , the heat transfer in a collection of nanoparticles interacting with an external laser source @xcite , and genuine three - body effect proposed to amplify the heat - transfer in a set of three parallel slabs @xcite . concerning the force ,",
    "only the three - body force for three atoms at thermal equilibrium has been calculated @xcite .    in this work",
    "we develop in detail a general approach to the casimir force out of thermal equilibrium and heat transfer in a system of three bodies immersed in an environment .",
    "the theory we present is valid for arbitrary dielectric and geometrical properties of the body , as well as for arbitrary values of the four temperatures involved ( the three temperatures of the bodies and the environmental one ) .",
    "as a side result we obtain the three - body expression for the casimir - lifshitz force at thermal equilibrium for arbitrary bodies . as for the theory for two bodies first presented in @xcite ,",
    "of which this work is a generalization , in our work we take into account the properties of each body independently by means of its scattering ( reflection and transmission ) operators .",

    "we gather from now on the expressions relative to force and heat flux in a unique notation , by introducing an index @xmath52 whose value @xmath53 is associated to heat flux and @xmath54 to the force . in particular , we define @xmath55 using the results of @xcite , the _ generalized flux _ can be cast under the form @xmath56 in this expression we have introduced the matrix elements of the operator @xmath57 , defined in terms of the correlation functions of the field amplitutes propagating in directions @xmath12 and @xmath58 in the region where @xmath59 is located throug the formula @xmath60 from we have @xmath61\\bigr\\},\\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the kronecker delta , we have introduced the trace operator @xmath63 and defined @xmath64 @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) being the projector on the propagative ( evanescent ) sector .",

    "the connection between total and source fields can be made explicit by introducing the reflection and transmission operators associated to each body and by writing down a self - consistent system of equations , in analogy with the method used in @xcite , describing the multiple reflections occurring in the three - body configuration . for the reflection and transmission operators of body @xmath1",
    "we will use the notations @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where @xmath12 describes the direction of propagation of the outgoing field .",
    "for example , the matrix element @xmath71 gives the amplitude of the field mode @xmath6 reflected by body @xmath1 for an incoming field mode @xmath72 : the frequency , implicitly contained in the reflection operator , is conserved since we consider only time - invariant configurations ( for more details see @xcite ) .",

    "this was already done in the case of two bodies @xcite , where the operators @xmath79 have been defined , describing the infinite series of multiple reflections in the _ cavity _ formed by bodies 1 and 2 .",
    "this interpretation explains why only @xmath80 and @xmath81 appear , i.e. the reflection operators of each body associated to the side on which the other body is located .",
    "we generalize here this definition by first introducing two - body reflection and transmission operators using the following intuitive definition given in the particular case of bodies 1 and 2 @xmath82 for example , the scattering processes participating to the definition of @xmath83 [ reflection on the right - hand side of the couple of bodies ( 1,2 ) ] are both single reflection on body 2 ( @xmath84 ) and the transmission inside the cavity ( 1,2 ) , the series of multiple reflections , and finally the transmission out of the cavity ( described by the second term of the sum ) .",
    "an appropriate modification of eq . gives the definition of the two - body reflection and transmission operators for the couple ( 2,3 ) .",
    "the definition allows now to define iteratively three - body intracavity @xmath85 operators such as @xmath86 and finally three - body reflection and transmission operators @xmath87 it is clear that in eq . , in order to write the three - body reflection and transmission operators , we have conceptually separated them in the two groups : ( 1,2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "it is possible to show that the alternative choice [ 1 and ( 2,3 ) ] , giving for example @xmath88 leads to equivalent results .",

    "<S> we study the casimir - lifshitz force and the radiative heat transfer in a system consisting of three bodies held at three independent temperatures and immersed in a thermal environment , the whole system being in a stationary configuration out of thermal equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> the theory we develop is valid for arbitrary bodies , i.e. for any set of temperatures , dielectric and geometrical properties , and describes each body by means of its scattering operators . </S>",
    "<S> for the three - body system we provide a closed - form unified expression of the radiative heat transfer and of the casimir - lifshitz force ( both in and out of thermal equilibrium ) . </S>",
    "<S> this expression is thus first applied to the case of three planar parallel slabs . in this context </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the non - additivity of the force at thermal equilibrium , as well as the equilibrium temperature of the intermediate slab as a function of its position between two external slabs having different temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we consider the force acting on an atom inside a planar cavity . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , differently from the equilibrium configuration , the absence of thermal equilibrium admits one or more positions of minima for the atomic potential . </S>",
    "<S> while the corresponding atomic potential depths are very small for typical ground state atoms , they may become particularly relevant for rydberg atoms , becoming a promising tool to produce an atomic trap . </S>"
