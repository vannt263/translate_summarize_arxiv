    "hard x - ray surveys are not strongly affected by dust obscuration and thus provide a relatively unbiased view of the agn phenomenon .",
    "deep chandra x - ray surveys have allowed us to test the basic prediction of population synthesis models of the x - ray background , namely , that a combination of obscured and unobscured agn is needed to explain the x - ray background hard spectral shape @xcite . according to the agn unification paradigm ,",
    "obscuration comes from optically thick dust blocking the central engine along some lines of sight .",
    "the temperature in this structure , which can range up to 1000  k ( dust sublimation temperature ) , and the roughly isotropic emission toward longer wavelengths should make both obscured and unobscured agn very bright in the mid - far infrared bands .",
    "this prediction was tested by iras ( e.g. , @xcite ) and iso ( e.g. , @xcite ) observations , which discovered a population of very luminous infrared sources coincident with x - ray emitters and therefore very good candidates to be obscured agn . with relatively bright flux limits",
    ", however , these surveys sample the nearby universe or extremely luminous , rare agn .",
    "very deep surveys were possible with iso ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but only over a very small area . with the spitzer space telescope , it is now possible to perform very deep infrared surveys , @xmath0100 - 1000 times deeper than typical iras observations , over appreciable areas , @xmath010 - 1,000 times more area than the deep iso surveys , thus permitting us , for the first time , to study a representative sample of the agn population at cosmologically - significant distances",
    "since agn comprise most of the x - ray background and are also very bright infrared sources , it is natural to ask what fraction of the extragalactic infrared background they may contribute .",
    "based on previous observations , the predicted contribution of agn to the infrared background ranged from @xmath020% @xcite to just a few percent @xcite , depending mostly on the assumptions for the amount of energy re - radiated in the infrared and the spatial density of obscured agn .",
    "the deeper infrared observations possible with spitzer are important for understanding the true contribution of agn to the extragalactic infrared background light .",
    "multiwavelength observations of a large , uniformly selected sample of moderate - luminosity agn at cosmologically significant distances provide a complete picture of the agn emission across the frequency spectrum and establish the total contribution of these sources to the energy budget of the universe .",
    "this is one of the main goals of the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) , a 0.1-square - degree study divided in two fields that overlap with the deepest x - ray observations , the chandra deep fields north @xcite and south @xcite .",
    "it consists of deep imaging in the optical with the hubble space telescope @xcite and in the infrared with the spitzer space telescope @xcite .",
    "these very deep multiwavelength observations allow a highly complete , relatively unbiased , view of the agn phenomenon and a test of the agn unification paradigm , well established in the local universe , at higher redshifts .",
    "in this paper we present spitzer observations of the agn in the goods fields , from 3.6 to 24 microns . in ",
    "2 we describe the spitzer irac and mips observations .",
    "results and discussion are presented in ",
    "3 , addressing the infrared luminosities of agn and normal galaxies , the x - ray to infrared ratios for goods and local agn , the infrared number counts of agn , and the agn contribution to the extragalactic infrared background light .",

    "the goods north and south fields , which cover @xmath0160 square arcminutes each , were observed with the spitzer space telescope as part of the goods legacy program ( pi : mark dickinson ) .",
    "observations were performed using the irac camera @xcite in the four available bands ( 3.6 - 8@xmath3 m ) and the mips instrument @xcite in the 24  @xmath3 m band .",
    "exposure times per sky - pixel for each field were @xmath023 hours in the irac bands .",
    "the mips 24-micron observations , available to us only in the goods - north field , had an exposure time of @xmath010.3 hours .",
    "individual images were processed through the spitzer science center basic calibrated data pipeline , and then post - processed and combined using customized routines developed by the goods team ( m. dickinson et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "sources were detected using sextractor @xcite on a combined 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath3 m band image filtered using a 5@xmath85 pixel gaussian profile with a fwhm of 1.8@xmath9 .",
    "photometry was performed using sextractor .",
    "the auto magnitude was used since aperture corrections , which we do not apply , would be very small , according to simulations ( m. dickinson et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "if instead we perform aperture photometry ( with an aperture diameter of 4@xmath9 ) and make the corresponding aperture corrections , which range from 0.3 magnitudes in the 3.6 @xmath3 m band to 0.7 at 8 @xmath3 m then the auto and aperture - corrected magnitudes differ by less than 0.2 magnitudes on average , with no obvious dependence on magnitude and no significant outliers . therefore our results do not depend significantly on the method used to perform the photometry .",
    "the formal @xmath10 , background - limited flux limits for an isolated point source in the four irac channels are 0.13 , 0.22 , 1.45 , and 1.61 @xmath3jy respectively . in practice ,",
    "the photometric uncertainty for a given source depends on the degree of crowding in the images , and on the details of how the photometry and source deblending are carried out .",
    "this increases the photometric errors , which we evaluate using monte carlo simulations of artificial sources added to the real data . according to simulations , all the irac images are 90% complete at @xmath014  @xmath3jy .    the mips 24-@xmath3 m image of the goods north field",
    "was reduced using a combination of the standard spitzer science center pipeline and customized routines created by the goods team ( r. chary et al .",

    "the 5@xmath11 flux limit for the mips observations is @xmath025  @xmath3jy and are 84% complete at that flux .",
    "the relatively large aperture used to calculate fluxes in both the irac and mips observations means that the light from the agn and the host galaxy are summed ; in any case , given the limited spatial resolution , the two contributions can not be separated from the infrared imaging alone .    in order to define the agn sample",
    "we start with the x - ray catalogs for the chandra deep fields north and south of @xcite , with the associations to the goods hst optical catalog from @xcite which uses the likelihood method described by @xcite .",
    "specifically , our sample consists of sources detected in the hard ( 28 kev ) chandra band that do not have multiple optical counterparts in the goods acs @xmath2-band image .",
    "only 3 sources in the south field and 6 in the north have multiple optical counterparts , so excluding these sources from the sample does not bias our results .",
    "( we do include sources with no @xmath2-band counterpart down to the limit @xmath2@xmath1227  mag . ) a large fraction of the sample , @xmath060% , have spectroscopic redshifts , obtained by @xcite in the south field and by @xcite in the north .",
    "most of the x - ray sources are obscured agn at moderate redshift , 0.5@xmath131 , and unobscured agn up to @xmath144 .",
    "more distant obscured agn are too faint for optical spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "sources with spectroscopic redshifts and hard x - ray luminosity lower than @xmath15  ergs  s@xmath5 are probably not agn dominated , since the most x - ray luminous star - forming galaxy known , ngc 3256 , has a total x - ray luminosity @xmath16  ergs  s@xmath5 in the 0.5 - 10 kev band @xcite ; so these were removed from our sample .",
    "this criterion removes 12 sources in the south field and 25 in the north . with these constraints ,",
    "the final sample includes 126 x - ray sources in the goods - south field and 179 in the -north field .    in order to look for spitzer counterparts of the chandra sources ,",
    "several search radii were tried , looking to maximize the number of sources with counterparts while keeping a low number of sources with multiple counterparts .",
    "the best results were obtained using a search radius of 2@xmath9 .",
    "typical astrometric errors are @xmath00.5@xmath9 in x - rays and @xmath00.2@xmath9 in the irac bands ; therefore , astrometric errors can be safely neglected when using a search radius of 2@xmath9 . in the north field",
    "160 sources ( 90% ) have a single irac counterpart , while in the south field 118 sources ( 94% ) have a single counterpart ; the rest have multiple counterparts . _",
    "this means that 100% of the x - ray sources are also bright in the near - infrared_. most of the x - ray sources have an infrared counterpart separated by less than 1@xmath9 , and in many cases this distance is smaller than 0.5@xmath9 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ off_dist ] . assuming a poissonian spatial distribution of infrared sources , the median chance of a random association is 0.74% and therefore we have high confidence that the correct infrared counterpart was identified correctly in all but one or two cases .",
    "the full catalog of agn detected in the goods field used in this work is presented in the on - line version of the journal , while for clarity a fraction of the information is presented in table  [ catalog ] .",
    "our sample only considers agn selected based on the x - ray information . because of this , highly obscured agn in which most of the x - ray emission is absorbed will be missed in our sample .",
    "the effects of this incompleteness are discussed in  4 .",
    "recently , agn selection methods based only on irac and mips colors ( e.g. , @xcite ) or a combination of spitzer infrared and radio properties ( e.g. , @xcite ) were presented . in the work of @xcite , agn are found in the region defined by 0.0@xmath1@xmath17@xmath10.3 , 0.2@xmath1@xmath18@xmath10.5 , 0.3@xmath1@xmath19@xmath10.7 , 0.1@xmath1@xmath20@xmath10.3 , 0.3@xmath1@xmath21@xmath10.5 and 0.1@xmath1@xmath22@xmath10.3 using only the irac bands ( fig . 8 on @xcite ) .",
    "although this criterion was defined only for agn at @xmath2@xmath231 , k corrections are very small so this method can be extended to higher redshifts .",
    "only 79 sources satisfy the agn criterion of @xcite in both the goods north and south fields . of these ,",
    "only 18 ( @xmath06% ) sources are detected in hard x - rays .",
    "this means that using this selection method misses a large fraction of the agn in the field , but it is useful to separate agn continuum - dominated sources from normal galaxies .",
    "this can be explained because a power - law continuum is assumed for the infrared emission in agn , while it is possible that most sources are dominated by the torus thermal emission in the infrared ( van duyne et al . , in prep ) .",
    "the selection method of @xcite is based mostly in radio emission and it is effective to detect luminous obscured quasars . using the infrared criterion of @xcite on the goods north field ,",
    "where mips data were available , only 3 sources have @xmath24@xmath25300  @xmath3jy and @xmath26@xmath2345  @xmath3jy and are detected in hard x - rays .",
    "unfortunately , neither spectroscopic nor photometric redshifts are available for those sources , so we can not ( yet ) classify them as obscured quasars .",
    "the fact that only a small number of sources are selected using this criterion is not surprising since only very luminous sources are found in this way and such sources are very rare and thus not easily detected in narrow - field surveys like goods .",
    "when spectroscopic redshifts were not available , we used photometric redshifts computed by @xcite for the south field and @xcite for the north field . using both spectroscopic and photometric redshifts , we were able to calculate luminosities for 93 sources ( 74% ) in the south field and 105 sources ( 59% ) in the north field . in order to study the quality of photometric redshifts we compared them with spectroscopic redshifts for sources in which both measurements are available",
    "the average value of the quantity ( @xmath27-@xmath28)/(1+@xmath29 ) is 0.02 , which indicates that photometric redshifts can be used in a statistical sense to study the properties of a sample of sources .",
    "however , errors in the photometric redshifts for individual sources can be large .",
    "about 30% of the sources compared here had a difference between photometric and spectroscopic redshift determination greater than 0.3 .",
    "therefore , photometric redshifts are used only to calculate statistical properties of a sample , not for individual sources .",
    "the observed - frame luminosity distributions for goods agn in the irac 3.6  @xmath3 m and mips 24  @xmath3 m bands are shown in fig .",
    "[ lum_hist ] .",
    "the vast majority of the sources can be classified as moderate - luminosity agn , in the range 10@xmath30 to @xmath010@xmath31  ergs  s@xmath5 .",
    "no k correction was attempted . however , from the theoretical agn sed library of @xcite , which spans unobscured to fully obscured agn over 4 decades in luminosity , we estimate that infrared luminosities in the 3 - 20 micron range would change by at most a factor of two due to k corrections . this is smaller than the bin size used in these histograms",
    ", so we do not expect the figure to change significantly were we able to do accurate k corrections .    for comparison , in fig .",
    "[ lum_hist ] we also show the observed - frame 3.6 and 24 micron luminosity distributions for normal galaxies in the goods fields , randomly selected to follow the same redshift distribution as the agn sample .",
    "redshifts for the normal galaxies were obtained from the spectroscopic surveys of @xcite and @xcite in the north field and from the vimos vlt deep survey @xcite in the south field . comparing the median infrared luminosities of agn and normal galaxies , agn are brighter by a factor of @xmath010 in the irac bands and @xmath015 in the mips 24 @xmath3 m band .",
    "there is a fair amount of overlap between the two populations , indicating that for low - luminosity agn ( @xmath010@xmath3010@xmath32  ergs  s@xmath5 ) the host galaxy can provide a significant contribution and perhaps even dominate the infrared emission .",
    "additionally , the luminosity distribution for sources with hard x - ray luminosity lower than 10@xmath30  ergs  s@xmath5 ( and thus removed from our agn sample ) is also shown in fig .  [ lum_hist ] .",
    "these sources have a luminosity distribution similar to that of normal galaxies and therefore we conclude that the x - ray emission in those sources is not from agn origin and most likely from star - formation activity .    in order to understand the relative contributions of infrared emission from active nucleus and galaxy , we performed a simple simulation in which we randomly paired a normal galaxy from the redshift - equivalent distribution ( infrared emission from stars only ) to each agn in the sample ( infrared emission from stars plus active nucleus ) .",
    "we then calculated the distribution of the ratio of galaxy to nuclear light , assuming the assigned galaxy correctly represented the emission from the host galaxy .",
    "this process was repeated 150 times with different random pairings .",
    "if indeed these normal galaxies correctly represent the host galaxy emission , which is of course uncertain but which is certainly true at optical wavelengths ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the ensuing distribution indicates the relative importance of the two components .",
    "the results of a set of these simulations are shown in fig .",
    "[ frac ] for the 8 and 24 micron bands .",
    "we find that at 8  @xmath3 m , @xmath33% of the sample is dominated by the agn ( i.e. , the luminosity of the active nucleus is greater than the galaxy luminosity ) . separating the sample in three luminosity bins , each with equal numbers of agn , we find that for total agn luminosities below @xmath34  ergs  s@xmath5 , roughly 3/4 of the sample is agn - dominated . for @xmath35  ergs  s@xmath5 , the fraction of agn - dominated sources is roughly 90% , and for higher luminosities",

    "the fractions are similar . at 24  @xmath3 m , @xmath080% of the sources",

    "of course , because of the limited spatial resolution , we can not say from the infrared data alone whether the agn host galaxies are similar to normal galaxies in the same redshift range .",
    "given the similarity of the optical properties , however , it would require a fairly contrived scenario to have the infrared properties be massively mismatched .",
    "the correlation of infrared and x - ray flux ( next section ) also supports the idea that the infrared emission from agn is dominated by the active nucleus .      in fig .",
    "[ x_ir ] we show the ratio of hard x - ray ( 28 kev ) to infrared ( 8  @xmath3 m ) luminosity versus hard x - ray and infrared luminosity for goods agn with spectroscopic redshifts and thus reliable luminosities . using the x - ray spectrum to separate obscured and unobscured agn",

    "[ x_ir ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the agn unification paradigm since both hard x - ray and infrared emission are _ relatively _ isotropic and unaffected by the amount of dust in the line of sight .",
    "similar results are found if the 24 micron fluxes are used instead ; however , these fluxes are only available for half of our sample and thus we decided to use the 8 micron fluxes .    in order to compare with previously known sources , in fig .",

    "there is no statistically significant discrepancy between the goods and local samples , although there is a hint that the values might diverge at high x - ray luminosity ( @xmath232@xmath11 significance ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that malmquist bias , which would make the average luminosity to appear to be higher at higher redshifts , can play a role in this difference .",
    "the trend for the average ratio of x - ray to infrared luminosity to increase with x - ray luminosity in the goods sample can be explained by the contribution of the host galaxy to the infrared light at low luminosities . assuming that this ratio has a value of 0.35 for the highest luminosity sources , which are clearly agn - dominated , and adding to the infrared luminosity the contribution from an average host galaxy ( estimated from the median 8  @xmath3 m luminosity for our random sample of galaxies , 7.67@xmath810@xmath30  ergs  s@xmath5 ) , we were able to reproduce the observed trend of x - ray to infrared luminosity ratio with x - ray luminosity ( solid line in fig .",

    "the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ x_ir ] show the effects of a spread in host galaxy luminosity , which is particularly important for low - luminosity agn and can account for most of the observed spread in the x - ray to infrared luminosity ratio at these luminosities .    performing a partial correlation analysis we found no significant correlation between the hard x - ray to infrared luminosity ratio and either hard x - ray or infrared luminosity , or with redshift or absorbing column density ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "we found only a mildly significant correlation between hard x - ray and infrared luminosities , with a pearson coefficient of @xmath00.604 and a correlation of similar significance between hard x - ray and infrared fluxes , indicating that the fluxes in these bands are directly related to the luminosity of the central engine .",

    "model details are as described in @xcite and modified by @xcite to include a decrease in the number of obscured agn with increasing luminosity , with the exception that we no longer interpolate between the near - infrared and optical spectra because this artificially over - predicts the mid - infrared flux .",
    "the obscured - to - unobscured agn ratio for sources with spectroscopic redshifts ( and thus @xmath36 determinations ) in our sample is @xmath01.5:1 , but this is consistent with the assumed ratio in the model , given that most of the obscured agn do not have spectroscopic redshift since they are optically faint , and some obscured agn are even missed in x - rays .",

    "a representative lower limit can be obtained simply by summing the infrared emission from the agn detected in the goods fields , weighted by the effective area at that x - ray flux . in fig .

    "[ agn_frac ] we use the previously described agn model to estimate the agn fraction as a function of infrared flux , correcting for agn missed by the x - ray selection . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ agn_frac ] , the decrease in the agn fraction with decreasing infrared flux is still observed , even after correcting for agn missed in x - rays .",
    "previous reports of the agn contribution in general estimated a higher contribution to the integrated emission .",
    "earlier infrared observations with iso ( e.g. , @xcite ) in the 15-micron band at brighter fluxes give higher values for the agn contribution ( 17% at 15@xmath3 m ) but depend on large extrapolations to lower fluxes .",
    "( the goods mips observations are @xmath025 times deeper than the iso data on the lockman hole . )",
    "@xcite made an estimate based on iso observations of bright unobscured agn in the elais s1 field . if , in order to calculate the total agn contribution from their measured value for unobscured agn we assume an obscured - to - unobscured ratio of @xmath04:1 , their results are consistent with the observed values obtained from the goods observations .",
    "an estimate based on x - ray samples and an average x - ray - to - infrared ratio by @xcite is @xmath050 - 80% higher than the values obtained directly from the spitzer observations . using a backward evolution model based on iras and iso observations and infrared luminosity functions , the agn contribution to the infrared background",
    "was also calculated by @xcite . in this case",
    "only an infrared color criterion was used to identify agn .",
    "this prediction is similar to the observed values in the 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath3 m bands but estimates a lower contribution at longer wavelengths , @xmath055% lower at 24  @xmath3 m .",
    "a recent study of agn detected by chandra using spitzer performed by @xcite , reported a value for the agn contribution to the infrared background of 10%-15% at 24  @xmath3 m in good agreement with our results .",
    "the earlier estimates of the agn contribution to the integrated extragalactic infrared light are therefore largely consistent with our results ; the earlier numbers differ mainly because of large extrapolations to lower fluxes .",
    "summarizing , the more precise values from our deep chandra and spitzer observations are 2.4% at 3.6  @xmath3 m , 3.0% at 4.5  @xmath3 m , 5.6% at 5.7  @xmath3 m , 4.7% at 8  @xmath3 m and 10.7% at 24  @xmath3 m . these numbers should be multiplied by a factor of @xmath01.45 in order to account for the contribution by compton - thick agn not detected in x - rays by chandra , namely , 3.5% at 3.6  @xmath3 m , 4.4% at 4.5  @xmath3 m , 8.1% at 5.7  @xmath3 m , 6.8% at 8  @xmath3 m and 15.5% at 24  @xmath3 m .",
    "we present here spitzer observations of the moderate - luminosity , moderate- to high - redshift agn in the goods fields , which include the deepest infrared and x - ray observations to date . in general",
    "these sources have similar x - ray to infrared luminosity ratios as agn in the local universe .",
    "agn are @xmath010 - 15 times brighter in the infrared than normal galaxies , although there is some overlap between the luminosity distribution of agn and normal galaxies , indicating that for low - luminosity agn the contribution to the infrared light from the host galaxy can be very important and may well dominate the observed emission .",
    "this can explain the observed trend of the x - ray - to - infrared luminosity ratio to increase with x - ray luminosity .",
    "we report the observed infrared flux distribution for goods agn , which has a slope of @xmath121.5 to 0.9 for fluxes higher than @xmath0100  @xmath3jy , with a source density of @xmath121000 agn per square degree at a depth of @xmath050 @xmath3jy in the irac bands . comparing to the expectations of a unification model for agn",
    ", we find reasonable agreement , showing that the basic properties of the moderate to high redshift agn population are well explained by the same unification paradigm that fits local sources very well , but with a factor of two less dust in the circumnuclear region .    from the spitzer observations , we calculate the minimum agn contribution to the extragalactic near - mid infrared background , obtaining a lower value than previously estimated , ranging from 2% to 10% in the 3 - 24 micron range .",
    "accounting for heavily obscured agn that are not detected in x - ray , the agn contribution to the infrared background increases by @xmath045% , to @xmath03 - 15% .",
