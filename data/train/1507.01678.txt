    "chern - simons theories play a central role in modern string theory . two major subjects in early days are open string field theory @xcite and topological string theory @xcite .",
    "it was known not only that chern - simons theory satisfies the axiom of topological field theory but also that the topological theory can be lifted to topological string theory .",
    "also , the beautiful gauge invariant structure was used to construct the covariant open string field theory .",
    "both of these developments are deeply related to understanding non - perturbative aspects of string theory .",
    "the relation between the chern - simons theory and the non - perturbative string theory becomes even more important in the supersymmetrization .",
    "it was known that up to @xmath4 the supersymmetric chern - simons theory can be constructed for any gauge group and any representation @xcite .",
    "also , it was noted that when the levels are summed up to zero , the theory enjoys the conformal symmetry @xcite .",
    "after some special arguments of the @xmath5 enhancements @xcite , finally it was found that when the gauge group is @xmath6 with the subscripts denoting levels @xmath7 and @xmath8 and the matters are in the bifundamental representation , the supersymmetry is enhanced to @xmath9 @xcite , which is called the abjm theory .",
    "later , it was also found @xcite that even when the ranks of two factors in the gauge group are different , @xmath10 , the chern - simons theory still enjoys the enhanced supersymmetry @xmath9 , which is called the abj theory .",
    "so we shall often refer to them inclusively as abj(m ) theory .",
    "the discovery of this maximal supersymmetric conformal chern - simons theory enables us to open up another window to non - perturbative aspects of string theory . in the study of the non - perturbative effects in string theory",
    ", we were naturally led to a conjecture that there exists an eleven - dimensional theory , which is dubbed m - theory @xcite .",
    "it is expected that this theory is the _ mother _ theory with fundamental _ membrane _ excitation from which our perturbative string theory stems after compactifications , though only little is known about this _",
    "mysterious _ theory . from the supergravity analysis ,",
    "it is known that , besides the fundamental electric m2-branes , there exist solitonic magnetic m5-branes . also , from the ads / cft correspondence , we know that the degrees of freedom of @xmath0 m2-branes and @xmath0 m5-branes are @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively @xcite .    the abjm theory describes a stack of @xmath0 multiple m2-branes put on the target space @xmath13 , while the abj theory describes a composite system of both @xmath14 multiple m2-branes and @xmath15 multiple fractional m2-branes for @xmath16 . for other superconformal chern - simons theory with less supersymmetries",
    "@xcite , we expect that they describe multiple m2-branes on various backgrounds with less supersymmetries .",
    "it is then natural to ask whether we can reproduce the degrees of freedom by studying the free energy of the abjm theory in the large @xmath0 limit . also , it is interesting to see how the large @xmath0 corrections behave and whether there is any interesting physical implication in it .",
    "in contrast to chern - simons theory , let us shortly comment on yang - mills theory .",
    "along with the chern - simons theory , yang - mills theory also plays a crucial role in modern string theory .",
    "especially , it is known that multiple d - branes are described by the maximally supersymmetric yang - mills theory with the gauge group @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "this was found by identifying the dynamical degrees of freedom of d - branes as open string excitations appearing in each pair of the multiple d - branes .",
    "the free energy @xmath18 in the large @xmath0 limit is interpreted as the number of the matrix elements and matches with the supergravity computation @xcite .",
    "although the maximally supersymmetric chern - simons theory selects a special gauge group and a special representation , the maximally supersymmetric yang - mills theory is defined for general gauge groups and representations .",
    "then , it is natural to expect that the gauge group and the matter contents of the abj(m ) theory are special .",
    "in fact it was observed in @xcite that , when we look at the matrix model appearing after applying the localization techniques , the gauge group and the matter content have a good interpretation in the supergroup @xmath19 .",
    "interestingly , the relation to the supergroup @xmath19 persists even in the one - point function of the half - bps wilson loop . the underlying relation to the supergroup may go beyond the accidental relation after the localization techniques and plays some roles in understanding the abj(m ) theory itself .",
    "in the supersymmetric theory , it was found that when we compute the partition function or the correlation function preserving supersymmetries , the infinite - dimensional path integral reduces to a finite - dimensional matrix integration @xcite . for more careful explanation of the localization techniques ,",
    "see a review @xcite in this volume .",
    "after the localization techniques , the partition function of the abj(m ) theory is reduced to a matrix model @xcite .",
    "although many works are concentrated on the matrix model expression itself , solving the matrix model is an interesting and important subject . in physics",
    "solving one theory classically means finding the exact solutions to the equation of motion , while solving one theory on the quantum - mechanical level means performing the path integral exactly .",
    "since the localization techniques already reduce the infinite - dimensional path integral into a matrix integration , solving the abj(m ) theory amounts to performing the matrix integration exactly .",
    "this is our main results in @xcite and we shall explain it in more details in the remaining part of the introduction .    before explaining the details ,",
    "let us try to discuss our motivation and expectation for the results .",
    "first of all , the full expression of the abj(m ) partition function may provide some hidden structures of the m2-branes . after reproducing the predicted @xmath11 behavior in the large @xmath0 limit from the matrix model @xcite ,",
    "it is natural to ask how the corrections look like . especially , compared with the matrix interpretation of the @xmath18 behavior for the d - branes , it is perplexing to find the @xmath11 behavior for the m2-branes .",
    "we expect that finding out all the corrections will give us some hints to this mysterious @xmath11 behavior of the m2-branes .",
    "prior to the discovery of the abj(m ) theory , there were attempts in finding out the worldvolume theory of the m2-branes from a generalization of the lie algebra @xcite .",
    "though it turned out the algebra is very restricted and is not explored extensively any more , these works may suggest a hidden novel structure in m2-branes to be discovered .",
    "secondly , the abj(m ) theory is one of the maximally supersymmetric theories .",
    "if we consider that the uniqueness of string theory stems from the maximum in the supersymmetrization , we expect that the maximally supersymmetric theories will play a crucial role in understanding string theory .",
    "at this point it should be important to study carefully all of fundamental quantities in the maximally supersymmetric theories .",
    "thirdly , let us stress the importance of the exact solution .",
    "the main method in studying physics is the perturbation theory .",
    "however , in a standard situation , the physics beyond the perturbation theory has a very rich structure .",
    "we expect that the exact instanton expansion will provide us a window to understand non - perturbative effects .    in the remaining part of the introduction ,",
    "let us shortly recapitulate the main results of a series of our works @xcite .",
    "we will see that the results provide some insights to the above questions .      after applying the localization techniques",
    ", the partition function of the abj(m ) theory reduces to a matrix model @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 denotes the product taking over all of pairs @xmath23 satisfying @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively , while the product @xmath26 denotes @xmath27 .",
    "the integration is defined by @xmath28 the derivation of this partition function is originally done in @xcite . here",
    "we shall not go into the details of the derivation and instead take this abj(m ) matrix model as our starting point .",
    "this matrix model comes from the maximally superconformal chern - simons theory .",
    "let us shortly comment on the beauty of this matrix model @xcite . in the most complicated part of this partition function is probably the measure @xmath29 this measure can be simplified largely by dropping one factor of the gauge group @xmath30 this measure is the famous one of the chern - simons matrix model . if the reader is not familiar with it , she can replace the hyperbolic function by a rational function @xmath31 this is nothing but the @xmath32 invariant vandermonde measure appearing in the diagonalization of the @xmath33 hermite matrix in the gaussian matrix model .",
    "we can restore the hyperbolic function by exponentiating the variables @xmath34 into @xmath35 .",
    "if we want to restore the dependence of the variables @xmath36 , all we have to do is the supersymmetrization . namely we replace the invariant measure of @xmath32 by that of the supergroup @xmath19 @xmath37 after exponentiating @xmath38 into @xmath39 respectively",
    ", we come back to the original measure of the abj(m ) matrix model .",
    "the explanation is summarized in table [ gaussian ] .    in this sense",
    ", we can say that the abj(m ) matrix model is the generalization of the most fundamental gaussian matrix model with the simultaneous deformation of the supersymmetrization and the chern - simons deformation . as a message",
    ", we would like to stress that , aside from the physical interpretation , even purely from a mathematical viewpoint , the abj(m ) matrix model is one of the most fundamental matrix models which deserve careful study .",
    "@xmath40      now let us summarize the result found in a series of works @xcite for both the abjm case and the abj case .",
    "let us reparametrize the arguments of the partition function @xmath41 in as @xmath42 with @xmath43 and define the grand canonical partition function @xmath44 with @xmath45 and the ( modified ) grand potential @xmath46 with @xcite @xmath47 by regarding the rank @xmath0 as the number of particles and introducing the chemical potential @xmath34 dual to @xmath0 .",
    "note that the phase dependence of the partition function @xmath42 was studied carefully in @xcite and to make contact with the topological string theory we have to take the absolute value of the partition function in defining the grand potential @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that the large @xmath0 physics in the canonical ensemble is governed by the large @xmath34 limit in the grand canonical ensemble , thus below we focus on this expansion .",
    "note that the grand canonical partition function defined originally in is symmetric under the @xmath48 shift of the chemical potential @xmath49 due to the periodicity the grand partition function contains an oscillatory behavior in an apparent sense @xcite .",
    "the ( modified ) grand potential in is defined by getting rid of this oscillation . in the inverse transformation ,",
    "the partition function is given in terms of the grand canonical partition function @xmath44 by@xmath50 while in the grand potential by @xmath51 this difference plays crucial roles , for example , in discussing the generalizations of the abjm theory in @xcite .",
    "let us first display our main result , and explain how it was found and what the physical implication is later in the subsequent subsections .",
    "the large @xmath34 results of the grand potential can be summarized as follows .",
    "the grand potential is split into the `` perturbative '' part and the `` non - perturbative '' part @xmath52 where `` effective '' chemical potential @xmath53 will be explained later .",
    "the perturbative part is given by @xmath54 where the coefficients @xmath55 and @xmath56 are @xcite @xmath57 while @xmath58 is @xcite @xmath59 for integral @xmath7 , the integration is performed explicitly .",
    "the non - perturbative part is given by @xmath60 .",

    "namely , the function @xmath68 is the free energy of the refined topological string theory , while @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the free energy of the original topological string theory and the free energy in the so - called nekrasov - shatashvili ( ns ) limit .",
    "the integers @xmath71 are the bps indices , which are topological invariants counting modes on the manifolds .",
    "the relation between two khler parameters @xmath72 and the chemical potential @xmath34 is given by @xmath73 while the string coupling @xmath74 is identified to the level @xmath7 as @xmath75 note that , in , we need to substitute for the effective chemical potential @xmath76 it is interesting to find that the abj(m ) matrix model has a deep relation to the topological string theory @xcite .",
    "this result , with the effective chemical potential plugged in , shows that the non - perturbative effects consist of terms @xmath77 with @xmath78 being polynomials of @xmath34 . here",
    "the effect of @xmath79 is identified with the worldsheet instanton , which is a fundamental string wrapping the holomorphic cycle @xmath80 in @xmath13 on the gravity side @xcite , and that of @xmath81 is the membrane instantons , which is a d2-brane wrapping the lagrangian submanifold @xmath82 @xcite . in particular",
    ", the coefficients @xmath78 with @xmath83 or @xmath84 take the following form @xcite @xmath85 besides the worldsheet instantons and the membrane instantons , the full instanton series contains the bound states of these two instantons .      here",
    "we shall explain how the result with and was found in chronological order . from the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence , the @xmath11 behavior of the degrees of freedom of the @xmath0 multiple m2-branes @xcite in the large @xmath0 limit was known from the gravity side about two decades ago .",
    "the study from the gauge theory side to reproduce the @xmath11 behavior and investigate the corrections , on the other hand , was started quite recently @xcite after the discovery of the worldvolume theory of the multiple m2-branes @xcite .",
    "for the explanation , we shall mainly concentrate on the abjm case .",
    "since the partition function was reduced to a matrix integration from the localizations of the supersymmetric theories @xcite , we can apply t hooft expansion , the standard matrix model technique to it .",
    "the t hooft expansion is to consider the t hooft limit @xmath86 and keep track of the @xmath87 corrections .",
    "then , the free energy @xmath88 is given by @xmath89 which can be regarded as the genus expansion . from this viewpoint , it is not difficult to imagine that the t hooft expansion has a good interpretation in string theory .    the first important work of the abjm matrix model is the reproduction of the @xmath11 behavior @xcite in the t hooft limit . in @xcite",
    "it was further noted that the expansion has infinitely many @xmath87 corrections @xmath90 where we only present the result schematically .",
    "especially , the coefficients are not displayed and the t hooft coupling constant is slightly shifted from the original one , but we will only come back to these points later .",
    "the study of the @xmath87 corrections is most easily done by observing the relation between the abj(m ) matrix model and the topological string theory on local @xmath91 @xcite and studying with the holomorphic anomaly equation @xcite from the topological string theory .",
    "here it is interesting to notice a triangular structure in the expansion .",
    "namely , by going to one higher genus from @xmath92 to @xmath93 we always gain only one more perturbative term and the perturbative terms in @xmath94 range between @xmath95 and @xmath96 in the large @xmath97 limit .",
    "this means that the large @xmath0 expansion can be alternatively obtained by taking the large @xmath0 limit with @xmath98 @xmath99 fixed . if we look at the coefficients carefully , it is not difficult to observe that after introducing @xcite @xmath100 the infinite expansion can be taken care of partially .",
    "so the remaining question is whether we can perform the other summation by dropping the non - perturbative terms and solving the perturbative holomorphic anomaly equation . in @xcite",
    "it was found that if we drop the non - perturbative corrections all of the perturbative expansions can be summed up to the airy function @xmath101.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in @xcite the constant @xmath58 was not taken care of but this constant was later pointed out in @xcite and studied carefully in @xcite .",
    "there are many arguments on the meaning of the airy function appearing in the summation of the perturbative corrections .",
    "technically it suggests the viewpoint of the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "namely , the integral representation of the airy function is @xmath102 where the integral contour @xmath103 comes from the infinity in the region with angle @xmath104 seen from the origin and goes to the infinity in the region with angle @xmath105 . comparing this expression with the inverse transformation , it is not difficult to find that the complicated airy function is mapped to a simple cubic function .",
    "this suggests that the full expression is clearer in the grand canonical ensemble .    as pointed out in @xcite , there are dissatisfactions with the t hooft expansion . in the t hooft expansion ,",
    "the large @xmath0 limit is taken by fixing the t hooft coupling @xmath106 . however , in approaching to the m - theory regime in the large @xmath0 limit , the parameter we want to fix is the level @xmath7 itself which characterizes the m - theory background @xmath13 , @xmath107    these ideas were incarnated in @xcite , by rewriting the partition function of the abjm theory with gauge group @xmath6 into that of a fermi gas system with @xmath0 non - interacting particles whose hamiltonian is given by @xmath108 with the canonical commutation relation @xmath109=i\\hbar$ ] where the chern - simons level plays the role of the planck constant , @xmath110 .",
    "this beautiful rewriting directly suggests another analysis for the study of the abjm matrix model .",
    "namely , we can study the grand canonical ensemble of the abjm matrix model from the wkb expansion around @xmath111 @xcite . in this expansion",
    ", we first expand the whole grand potential in the small @xmath7 region @xmath112 and further study each term separately in the large @xmath34 expansion .",
    "after that , we collect all terms of the same order in @xmath34 and hope that we can sum up the @xmath7 expansion . in this sense",
    "we can separate the small @xmath7 expansion and the large @xmath34 expansion and take the large @xmath34 limit by keeping the level @xmath7 fixed .",
    "both the t hooft expansion and the wkb expansion are powerful to study the matrix model to some extent . on one hand ,",
    "the t hooft expansion detects not only the perturbative part of the airy function but also the worldsheet instanton part , though is sensible to neither the membrane instanton part nor the bound state part .",
    "this is because after plugging in the stationary condition for @xmath34 @xmath113 the worldsheet instanton factor and the membrane instanton factor in become @xmath114 on the other hand , the wkb expansion detect only the perturbative part and the membrane instanton part , but not the worldsheet instanton part or the bound state part .",
    "so , unfortunately , for the bound state of the worldsheet instantons and the membrane instantons , neither the t hooft expansion nor the wkb expansion is applicable .",
    "the only method we have is the numerical analysis and the pole cancellation mechanism , which we will explain in the next subsection .      in determining the non - perturbative effects",
    ", the so - called pole cancellation mechanism plays an important role .",
    "let us recapitulate it shortly .",
    "for this purpose we display the explicit forms of the first few worldsheet instantons in @xmath115 and membrane instantons @xcite @xmath116 it is not difficult to find that the coefficients of the @xmath117-th worldsheet instanton contain poles when @xmath118 , while the coefficients of the @xmath119-th membrane instanton contain poles when @xmath120 .",
    "however , it is interesting to observe that whenever one coefficient is divergent the other coefficient is always divergent as well and totally the coefficient is completely finite .",
    "this property was first observed in @xcite and the importance was stressed in @xcite .",
    "this property is probably due to the supersymmetries .",
    "since there is no phase transition in theories with enough supersymmetries , the partition function should be finite . from the viewpoint of applications , this property can be used to fix first few instanton coefficients .",
    "in fact the first few coefficients of the membrane instantons listed above were found from this pole cancellation mechanism .",
    "the existence of the membrane instantons was first observed in @xcite .",
    "it is surprising that the first quantitative study of the membrane instanton is performed in this way .",
    "we can proceed to the bound states and find a similar pole cancellation mechanism there .",
    "namely , instead of the simple pole cancellation mechanism between the worldsheet instanton and the membrane instanton , for higher instanton effects the bound state of the worldsheet instanton and the membrane instanton appears as well .",
    "hence , we need to consider the cancellation among all of the bound states besides the pure worldsheet instanton and the pure membrane instanton .",
    "in @xcite we find that the effect of the bound states can be incorporated into that of the worldsheet instantons by shifting the chemical potential as in . as a bonus , after shifting the chemical potential @xmath34 into the effective one @xmath121 , we find that the quadratic polynomial coefficients of the pure membrane instanton @xmath122 become linear polynomials , where the coefficients of the linear terms and constant terms obey a derivative relation . finally , in @xcite ,",
    "all of these structure are reexpressed in terms of the refined topological string theory as in .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to review the beautiful aspects of the abj(m ) matrix model and its generalizations . after reviewing the history of the progress in section [ history ] and section [ cancellation ] , it is not difficult to imagine that the explanation would be the simplest if we start with reviewing the fermi gas formalism .",
    "we shall do this in the next section first for the abjm matrix model and then generalize to the abj matrix model .",
    "after that , in section [ npcorr ] , we shall proceed to various analysis including the wkb expansion , the exact evaluation of the partition function , the numerical study of the grand potential , the pole cancellation mechanism and the viewpoint from the topological string theory .",
    "finally , in section [ topics ] we summarize some recent progress in the supersymmetry enhanced case and more general cases .",
    "in this section , let us explain how the fermi gas formalism is applied to the abjm and abj matrix model .      in this subsection , we shall explain the fermi gas formalism for the abjm matrix model @xcite .",
    "namely , we shall study by restricting ourselves to the case of @xmath123 and define @xmath124 using the cauchy identity @xmath125 one can show that is rewritten as @xmath126 note that the two determinant factors are identical , though we write them separately , so that the structure is clearer . using a determinantal formula in @xcite , we can combine the two determinants @xmath127 note that here @xmath128 stands for the integration @xmath129 in other words , we regard two ingredients @xmath130 and @xmath131 as matrices with the continuous indices @xmath34 and @xmath36 . as in the discrete case , where we perform the matrix multiplication by contracting the indices , here",
    "the contractions of the continuous indices are done by the integrations given in .    after expanding the determinant of and rescaling the integration variables @xmath132 ,",
    "@xmath133 , we find that it can be expressed as a sum over permutations",
    "@xmath134 @xmath135 with @xmath136 given by @xmath137 if we use the fourier transformation @xmath138 by introducing the coordinate operator @xmath139 and the momentum operator @xmath140 satisfying @xmath141=i\\hbar$ ] with @xmath110 and the coordinate eigenstate @xmath142 normalized by @xmath143 , we find that @xmath136 can be expressed as @xmath144 after some further canonical transformations with the help of the formula @xmath145 and a similarity transformation , we finally find that @xmath146 can be interpreted as a density matrix of a quantum mechanical system @xmath147 with , which leads to the expression @xmath148 the formula can be regarded as the @xmath149-graded partition function of a particle propagating from a state labeled by the coordinate @xmath150 to the permutated coordinate @xmath151 .",
    "this is nothing but the partition function of a fermi gas system . to avoid unnecessary complexities ,",
    "hereafter we shall often drop the hats for the operators @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "it is convenient to define the grand partition function @xmath152 by introducing the chemical potential @xmath34 conjugate to @xmath0 and summing over @xmath0 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath152 can be written as a fredholm determinant of @xmath153 @xmath154 and the grand potential @xmath155 is given by is different from the modified one defined in . ]",
    "@xmath156 the expression of the fredholm determinant and its expansion can be shown by relating the coefficients of @xmath157 , to the combinatorics of distributing @xmath0 into an assembly of @xmath158 cycles of length @xmath119 satisfying @xmath159 @xcite .    in terms of the eigenvalues @xmath160 of the hamiltonian @xmath161 , the grand partition function is given by @xmath162 hence the problem boils down to the diagonalization of the hamiltonian .",
    "the study of the spectrum of the abjm hamiltonian was initiated in @xcite using the hankel matrix representation of @xmath153 , which was later generalized to other models .",
    "note also that the partition function can also be rewritten as @xmath163 which is useful to discuss the generalization to the abj model .      in the previous subsection",
    ", we have given the fermi gas formalism for the abjm matrix model .",
    "using this fermi gas formalism , we shall explain how the exact instanton expansion was found in the next section .",
    "before it , let us comment that the fermi gas formalism is also applicable to the abj matrix model where the gauge group @xmath10 has different ranks . in generalizing the discussions in the previous subsection , there are two fermi gas formalisms for the abj matrix model",
    "one is to dress the density matrix in by extra factors with the traces kept unchanged , while the other is to keep the density matrix and introduce the endpoints for the density matrix .    since the extra physical ingredients of the abj theory compared with the abjm theory is the fractional m2-branes , two formalisms amount to expressing the fractional branes by changing the closed string backgrounds or from the open string excitations .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to call these two formalisms as closed string formalism and open string formalism respectively .",
    "after the perturbative coefficients @xmath164 , @xmath56 and @xmath58 and the worldsheet instantons were found from the consistency with the t hooft expansion @xcite , the topological string on local @xmath165 and the abjm limit @xmath166 , we can use either of these fermi gas formalisms to further study the membrane instantons and the bound states .",
    "let us start the study of the abj matrix model with different ranks . in what follows , we will set @xmath167 and assume @xmath168 without loss of generality .",
    "first let us note that the partition function for @xmath169 is nothing but the bosonic @xmath170 chern - simons matrix model , which is given by @xcite @xmath171 as discussed in @xcite , if we define @xmath172 to be the absolute value of the partition function @xmath173 normalized by the chern - simons case ( @xmath169 ) , @xmath174 we find that @xmath172 is given by an integration @xmath175 with a dressing factor @xmath176 which is very similar to in the abjm matrix model .",
    "the seiberg - like duality of the abj theory @xmath177 implies that @xmath178 is invariant under the exchange @xmath179 with @xmath7 and @xmath0 fixed . also , note that the original partition function @xmath173 ( as well as the chern - simons case @xmath180 ) vanishes when @xmath181 , which is consistent with the conjecture that the supersymmetry of the abj theory is spontaneously broken for @xmath181 .",
    "again , using the cauchy identity , @xmath178 can be recast as a fermi gas form @xmath182 with the density matrix changed into @xmath183 using this dressed density matrix , the grand partition function @xmath44 in is given by @xmath184      having seen the description of the fractional branes by changing the closed string background in the previous subsubsection , here let us turn to the description from the open string @xcite .",
    "this formalism has a benefit in the compatibility with the vacuum expectation values of the half - bps wilson loop , since we end up with an ultimate fermi gas formalism which includes both the m2 fractional branes and the half - bps wilson loop . as a corollary of this formalism",
    ", we can reproduce , on one hand , the fermi gas formalism for the vacuum expectation values of the half - bps wilson loop @xcite , and on the other hand , that for the partition function of the m2 fractional branes @xcite .    to state the results we need some preparations . instead of the partition function itself , since the formalism incorporates the insertion of the half - bps wilson loop as well , let us consider the vacuum expectation value of the half - bps wilson loop .",
    "after the localization of the supersymmetric theory , it was found @xcite that the insertion means to include a loop operator in the matrix model @xmath185 ^ 2 e^{\\frac{ik}{4\\pi}(\\sum_{i=1}^{n_1}\\mu_i^2-\\sum_{j=1}^{n_2}\\nu_j^2)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the loop operator @xmath186 is the so - called supersymmetric schur polynomial , which is nothing but the character of the hidden supergroup @xmath19 .",

    "it is probably the simplest to find out this supersymmetric schur polynomial by expressing the original schur polynomial in terms of a diagonal matrix @xmath191 and the trace @xmath192 ( in other words , the power sum symmetric polynomials ) and replacing the diagonal matrix by a diagonal supermatrix @xmath193 and the trace by a supertrace .",
    "for example , let us consider the supersymmetric schur polynomial of the second symmetric tensor in the supergroup @xmath19 with @xmath14 and @xmath188 being large enough @xmath194{2}}(e^\\mu)=\\frac{1}{2}(\\operatorname{tr}\\operatorname{diag}(e^{\\mu}))^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{tr}\\operatorname{diag}(e^{2\\mu}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then after the replacement we find that the supersymmetric schur polynomial can be decomposed into the original one by @xmath194{2}}(e^\\mu|e^\\nu)=s_{\\young[-1]{2}}(e^\\mu ) + s_{\\young[-1]{1}}(e^\\mu)s_{\\young[-1]{1}}(e^\\nu ) + s_{\\young[-2]{11}}(e^\\nu).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    also , let us define the vacuum expectation value in the grand canonical ensemble @xmath195^\\text{gc}_{k , m}(z)=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\langle s_y\\rangle_k(n , n+m)z^n,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as for the partition function .",

    "first of all , we regard @xmath200 and @xmath201 as matrices and @xmath202 as a vector with continuous indices @xmath34 and @xmath36 . again , as explained below , we multiply matrices with continuous indices by the integrations .",
    "so each expression is a scalar constructed by the inner product of two vectors with many matrices sandwiched in between .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath200 , @xmath201 and @xmath202 is @xmath203 now let us turn to the integers @xmath204 and @xmath205 . in short , these integers are @xmath206-th leg length and @xmath207-th arm length , which appear in the frobenius symbol @xmath208 .",
    "the frobenius symbol for the abjm @xmath209 case is found by drawing the diagonal line for the young diagram and counting the number of boxes horizontally or vertically for the arm length or the leg length , respectively .",
    "for the general abj case with @xmath210 , all we have to do is to shift the diagonal line by @xmath211 boxes .",
    "note that , after shifting the diagonal line , the number of the arm lengths and that of the leg lengths are not equal any more .",
    "hence , we can not consider the determinant of the square matrix .",
    "we can restore , however , the equality of the numbers by consider the `` inverse '' arm length as well .",
    "the subscript @xmath212 appearing in is nothing but this inverse arm length .",
    "therefore , we can say that the lower expression in comes from the usual arm length while the upper one is from the inverse arm length .",
    "( see e.g.  @xcite for figures explaining the frobenuis symbol . )    before explaining how the expression is obtained , let us first see how this formula is beautiful and useful simultaneously .",
    "first let us consider the abjm case @xmath213 with a non - trivial insertion of the loop operator . then , we find that @xmath214 and the upper expression of @xmath215 is absent .",
    "if we further use the same formula for the hook young tableaux @xmath216 then , as a corollary of the above formula , we can express the vacuum expectation value of a general loop operator as the determinant of those of the hook loop operators constructed by taking all combinations of the arm lengths and the leg lengths from the original young tableaux @xcite @xmath217 note that , without taking the vacuum expectation value , it is a classical mathematical result stating that the character itself satisfies the same type of formula @xmath218 which is called giambelli formula .",
    "hence , in other words , what we have shown is that we can put to each loop operator in the giambelli formula the normalized vacuum expectation values in the sense of the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "namely , the normalized vacuum expectation values defined in is giambelli compatible .    next ,",
    "let us turn to another special case of the partition function with no insertions @xmath219 .",
    "then , we find @xmath220 since @xmath221 in this case . if we regard the trace operator without endpoints as closed strings and the meson operators @xmath222 which appears by expanding the expression in as open strings , this formula seems to state that the fractional m2-branes can be constructed from the open strings .",
    "this is reminiscent of the fact that classical d - brane solutions can be studied from open string field theory @xcite .",
    "so far we have stressed the beauty of this formula .",
    "it is also interesting to note that this formula is actually very useful . in section [ exactvalues ]",
    ", we shall see that the special form of the density matrix is very useful to compute the powers of the density matrix .",
    "our formula in also shows the same computability .",
    "namely , due to the expression of the meson operator , we can start with a vector @xmath223 and multiply matrices @xmath224 and @xmath225 to it one after another without difficulty .",
    "let us now turn to the explanation how this expression is obtained .",
    "first let us explain the formula for the partition function @xmath226 .",
    "again our starting point is the matrix model . instead of the cauchy determinant formula ,",
    "let us consider the following formula @xmath227 this is a natural combination of the vandermonde determinant and the cauchy determinant , which reduces to the vandermonde determinant for the special case of @xmath228 , while reduces to the cauchy determinant for @xmath213 .",
    "this formula can be proved by starting with the cauchy determinant with matrix size @xmath229 and sending @xmath230 , @xmath231 , @xmath232 , @xmath233 to infinity one after another .",
    "@xmath234    then , after plugging in @xmath235 and @xmath236 , we can reproduce the measure of the abj matrix model .",
    "let us see how we can put the measure into a fredholm determinantal expression as in the case of the abjm matrix model .",
    "since the substitution can be done at any stage , for simplicity , let us stick to the variables @xmath237 and @xmath238 .    since in the partition function we have two factors of this measure , we have two determinants .",
    "( see table [ twodet ] . )",
    "so there are a lot of terms in expanding the determinant .",
    "suppose we pick up one element from the lower @xmath239 submatrix of the first determinant , say @xmath240 .",
    "this means that , in this term , we are not allowed to pick up the other elements in the same row or in the same column .",
    "this element @xmath240 is associated to the integration of the variable @xmath241 .",
    "to finish the integration of @xmath241 , we need to decide which element to pick up from the first column in the second determinant .",
    "if we pick up one element from the lower @xmath239 submatrix of the second determinant , say @xmath242 , again this means that we do not pick up the others in the same row or column .",
    "then , we do not have other elements depending on the variable @xmath241 and we can complete the @xmath241 integration .    instead ,",
    "suppose in the second determinant we pick up another element from the upper @xmath243 submatrix , say @xmath244 .",
    "then , again there are no other elements associated with the variable @xmath241 and we can integrate @xmath241 .",
    "but now we are associated with the integration of another variable @xmath245 .",
    "to finish the @xmath245 integration , we need to pick up one element from the first row of the first determinant , say @xmath246 .",
    "( note that we can no more pick up the element @xmath247 from the first determinant , because we already pick up @xmath240 . )",
    "then , we are associated with the integration of the other variable @xmath248 .",
    "now , in the second determinant , if we choose from the lower @xmath239 submatrix , then we finish the @xmath248 integration .",
    "but if we choose from the upper @xmath243 submatrix , we need to finish another integration of the variable @xmath249",
    ".    we can continue this process and find a term consisting of a series of matrix multiplications , with two monomials of @xmath250 on the two ends connected by products of @xmath251 . after plugging in @xmath235 and @xmath236 ,",
    "essentially @xmath250 on the two ends turns into @xmath223 while @xmath251 becomes @xmath252 .",
    "this can be regarded as an open string with chan - paton factors on the two ends .",
    "of course , there are also contributions from the pure traces without ends .",
    "now the only problem is to count the combinatorial factor correctly .",
    "the answer can be found more efficiently by preparing a mathematical formula for the matrix multiplications .",
    "this was done in @xcite .    for the vacuum expectation values of the loop operator",
    ", we can use another beautiful formula @xcite , stating that the supersymmetric schur polynomial can be expressed as a ratio of two determinants , where the determinant in the denominator is nothing but the vandermonde - cauchy determinant we encounter in .",
    "hence , by combining the supersymmetric schur polynomial with the measure , we find that one of the two determinants appearing in the measure of the partition function is replaced by another determinant .",
    "hence , we can repeat the process explained in table [ twodet ] and find out the formula .",
    "after presenting the fermi gas formalism for the abj(m ) matrix model in the previous section , we can now start our study of the large @xmath34 expansion for the grand potential . for simplicity , we will mainly focus on the abjm case .",
    "since the expression as the partition function of a fermi gas system already suggests a statistical mechanical method , we first start with the wkb @xmath253 expansion . after that we turn to the study of the exact values of the partition function at finite @xmath0 and see how these exact values lead to the numerical study of the grand partition function .",
    "finally , we compare with the free energy of the topological string theory and see how the exact expression is found .",
    "as emphasized in @xcite , the fermi gas formalism enables us to study the m - theory regime .",

    "the higher order correction of the wkb expansion can be systematically computed by the method of wigner transformation @xcite , or the semi - classical analysis of the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) equation @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the coefficient @xmath164 and @xmath260 in do not receive corrections higher than @xmath261 and @xmath262 , respectively . on the other hand ,",

    ", one can check that the large @xmath34 expansion in table  [ nonpert ] is correctly reproduced .    in the following ,",
    "we briefly explain how to obtain these results . here",
    "we focus on the case of @xmath374 .",
    "what we should do is to take the limit @xmath381 in the general formula . as mentioned before ,",
    "both the worldsheet instanton correction and the membrane instanton correction are divergent in this limit , but the sum of them is finite . since we already know the divergences are canceled , we can focus on the finite parts .",
    "let us see the worldsheet instanton part in .",
    "it is easy to see that the finite part comes only from @xmath382 .",
    "the @xmath383 part is trivial . in the limit @xmath381 ,",
    "each term of the @xmath384 part is @xmath385 where @xmath386 means that we extract only the finite part .",
    "therefore the finite part of the worldsheet instanton correction is finally given by @xmath387 where @xmath388 is the instanton part in @xmath389 .",
    "we have used the relation @xmath390 at @xmath374 .",
    "similarly , as shown in @xcite , the finite part of the membrane instanton correction is finally given by @xmath391 from these results , one obtains the exact expressions .",
    "once the modified grand potential is known , one can compute the grand partition function . as seen before",
    ", the grand potential is constructed from @xmath361 by , with the subscript @xmath211 dropped here .",
    "let us plug the result into . for @xmath374 , using @xmath392,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath393 we find that the grand partition function is expressed in terms of the elliptic theta function by @xmath394 similarly , the grand partition function at @xmath373 is given by @xmath395 we stress that these expressions are _",
    "exact_. all the instanton corrections are encoded through the topological string free energies @xmath368 , @xmath369 and @xmath370 .",
    "there are two important consequences of the exact expressions and .",
    "one is that one can know the eigenvalues of the density matrix @xmath153 as the zeros of @xmath152 .",
    "in fact , it is well - known that the theta function has an infinite number of zeros .",
    "it was confirmed in @xcite that the zeros in and precisely reproduce the eigenvalues of @xmath396 at @xmath302 , numerically computed by the exact quantization condition in @xcite .",
    "the other important point is that it is possible to analytically continue @xmath152 from @xmath397 to @xmath398 .",
    "the continuation is essentially the modular s - transformation @xmath399 . in @xcite , this analytic continuation",
    "was indeed performed , and then the small @xmath400 expansion was computed .",
    "the results perfectly agree with the exact values of the partition function in table  [ tab : exactz ] ( see @xcite for more values ) !    furthermore , in @xcite the exact results for abjm at @xmath274 and abj at @xmath401 were presented .",
    "these also reproduce the known results perfectly .",
    "note that at @xmath274 the supersymmetry is no longer enhanced .",
    "nevertheless , we can write down the grand potential in a closed form . moreover , in @xcite , exact functional equations among the grand partition functions in the abj matrix model were found .",
    "these relations are quite similar to so - called quantum wronskian relations @xcite .",
    "it seems to imply an interesting connection to integrable models .      throughout this paper ,",
    "we focus on the large @xmath0 expansion in the m - theory limit . as already seen in subsection [ history ] , it is also interesting to consider the t hooft limit . in this limit ,",
    "the abjm theory is dual to type iia string theory on @xmath402 , and the large @xmath0 expansion is related to the genus expansion in this string theory . in the t hooft limit , the free energy admits the large @xmath0 expansion .",
    "the genus @xmath403 free energy @xmath92 can be exactly computed by using the holomorphic anomaly equation order by order @xcite .",
    "then , the genus expansion turned out to be an asymptotic series for given finite @xmath97 .",
    "the standard way to resum such formal asymptotic series is known as borel resummations . for the genus expansion ,",
    "let us define its borel transform by @xmath404 remarkably , as observed in @xcite , this borel transform has no singularities on the positive real axis .",
    "therefore the following borel summation is well - defined : @xmath405 the crucial conclusion in @xcite is that this borel summation does not reproduce the exact values of @xmath406 .",
    "there is an exponentially suppressed correction between them : @xmath407 this correction is nothing but the membrane instanton correction !",
    "it is not captured by the perturbative @xmath87 expansion .",
    "thus in the t hooft limit , the perturbative genus expansion and its borel resummation are insufficient to reconstruct the exact free energy .",
    "we need to take into account the membrane instanton corrections in addition to the perturbative expansion .",
    "it is an open problem how to incorporate such membrane instantons in the borel analysis .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , such corrections should be related to complex singularities of the borel transform .    as reviewed in this paper , we already know the complete m - theoretic expansion of the free energy with the help of the topological string",
    ". it should be in principle possible to use this result to understand the membrane instanton corrections to the genus expansion .",
    "interestingly , it was observed in @xcite that the borel resummation already contains a membrane instanton - like correction in the m - theoretic expansion from the fermi gas result .",
    "it would be interesting to reveal a quantitative relation between the t hooft expansion and the m - theoretic expansion .",
    "in section [ n=8 ] we have seen special cases with supersymmetry enhancements . here",
    ", let us see how the analysis can be generalized to other theories of the m2-branes . especially , when we are interested in gaining the universal property of the m2-branes , it is very important to generalize to as many theories as possible .",
    "we shall list some results obtained recently .",
    "first , let us give a viewpoint from the quiver diagrams , where the vertices represent the gauge group factor @xmath17 and the edges represent the bi - fundamental matters between the two factors connected . using the quiver diagram , the abjm matrix model is nothing but the dynkin diagram of affine @xmath408 or @xmath409 .",
    "then , it is natural to ask how about a general matrix model associated with @xmath410 .",
    "it was already found in @xcite that if the density matrix is hermitian , the perturbative part of any @xmath410 matrix model is summed up to the airy function with the coefficient @xmath103 given explicitly in @xcite .",
    "the other coefficients are not easy to obtain in general . in @xcite",
    "it was found that as long as the quiver diagram associated with the levels is a repetition of an original quiver diagram , we can express the grand potential of the new quiver diagram completely in terms of that of the original diagram . in @xcite",
    "it was restricted to the @xmath5 case @xcite where the chern - simons levels are given by @xmath411 and the explicit form of the coefficient @xmath357 was found to be @xmath412 with @xmath413,\\nonumber\\\\ b^{(2)}&=\\frac{1}{24}\\biggl[\\sigma(q)\\sigma(p ) -12\\biggl(\\frac{\\sigma(q , p , q)}{\\sigma(q ) } + \\frac{\\sigma(p , q , p)}{\\sigma(p ) } -\\frac{\\sigma(q , p)\\sigma(p , q)}{\\sigma(q)\\sigma(p)}\\biggr)\\biggr ] .",
    "\\label{b0b2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we adopt the notation of @xmath414 , with @xmath415 denoting an alternating sequence of @xmath207 and @xmath206 , whose definition is given by @xmath416 note that the condition in each sum can be stated as the requirement that we choose @xmath417 and @xmath418 out of a sequence @xmath419 by respecting its ordering .",
    "furthermore , if we restrict ourselves to the special @xmath5 @xmath420 model where the @xmath207 edges with @xmath421 and the @xmath206 edges with @xmath422 are separated , we find that the coefficient @xmath423 is given in terms of that of the abjm matrix model by @xcite @xmath424 a similar proposal was made in @xcite for the so - called m - theoretic matrix model @xcite , whose fermi gas hamiltonian is related to that of the @xmath425 model by a canonical transformation @xcite . in @xcite , the membrane instanton of the @xmath420 model was studied and a systematic expansion in terms of the derivative operators acting on the classical expression was found . using the results we were able to study the @xmath426 model in full details @xcite and find that the non - perturbative effects are given by the refined topological string theory as in the abjm matrix model .",
    "it still awaits to identify the calabi - yau manifold whose bps index describes the @xmath426 model , but we observed that the diagonal gopakumar - vafa invariant is nothing but that of the @xmath427 del pezzo surface .",
    "it is interesting to find that the correspondence between the topological string theory and the matrix model coming from the superconformal theory , is not restricted to the case of the abjm theory . in @xcite ,",
    "the non - perturbative effects were further explored .",
    "based on the systematic wkb analysis and exact computations in various special cases , analytic expressions of the first few membrane instanton corrections and worldsheet instanton corrections were conjectured for general @xmath420 and @xmath7 .",
    "the generalization , however , is not restricted to the @xmath428 quiver . in @xcite",
    "an @xmath429 sector was specified by requiring the long range force among the eigenvalues vanishes .",
    "it is then interesting to ask whether there is a fermi gas formalism for these series and whether the perturbative corrections are still summed up to the airy function . in @xcite",
    "we continue to study the @xmath430 quiver .",
    "we find that after using the cauchy determinant in a different way we can still give a fermi gas formalism to this type of theories and prove the previous proposal @xcite @xmath431 with the variables @xmath432 given as @xmath433 by the reordered @xmath434 , @xmath435 as in the @xmath5 case of the @xmath428 quiver , here we can also restrict ourselves to the case of uniform @xmath436 , @xmath437 , and find that the coefficient @xmath423 is consistent with @xmath438 up to @xmath439 , which is very similar to for the @xmath420 model .",
    "we hope that all these findings will finally be completed to a more systematic understanding .",
    "in this review article , we have explained carefully the quantum effects of the abjm theory and the abj theory , where the partition function and the vacuum expectation values of the half - bps wilson loop can be studied in full details including both the perturbative and non - perturbative corrections .",
    "we have seen many interesting properties .",
    "for example , the leading large @xmath0 behavior of the free energy is given by @xmath440 .",
    "the perturbative @xmath87 corrections are summed up to an airy function .",
    "the non - perturbative corrections include the effects interpreted as worldsheet instantons and those interpreted as membrane instantons . in general",
    ", the coefficients of both instantons and their bound states can be divergent at certain values of @xmath7 , though as a whole the divergences in these instanton effects cancel among themselves and the final result is completely finite .",
    "also , in section [ generalization ] we have seen that many generalizations enjoy these interesting properties . hence , one further direction is to generalize our analysis to as many theories as possible and identify this class clearly .",
    "it is surprising to find that the superconformal chern - simons theory of the @xmath430 quiver can also be formulated with the fermi gas system .",
    "it is then natural to ask whether we can apply the same method even for the @xmath441 quiver or their cousins with the orthogonal groups or the symplectic groups @xcite .",
    "we hope that through these studies we will end up with a universal understanding of the m2-branes .",
    "next , let us also stress that , after a large number of numerical analysis , our large @xmath34 expansion of the grand potential ( or large @xmath0 expansion of the partition function ) remains to be a conjecture .",
    "it is of course interesting to see how this conjecture is proved from a mathematical method .",
    "the study explained in section [ n=8 ] would be a first attempt in this direction .",
    "finally , let us come back to a more physical question .",
    "our original motivation in studying the abjm partition function is to understand the m2-branes .",
    "after seen all of the perturbative and non - perturbative corrections , it is reasonable to come back to ask what we have learned on the m2-brane interactions .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have much to say about it at this stage , except that some of the results can be rederived from the supergravity @xcite .",
    "however , we believe that the beautiful structure we find would be a guide towards a clearer understanding of the @xmath442 law or even a better description of the mysterious m - theory .",
