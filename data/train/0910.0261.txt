    "the sun is widely thought to be formed from material representative of local physical conditions in the galaxy at the time of its formation and to represent a standard chemical composition .",
    "homogeneity hypothesis _ has been often put in question because of many improvements in the observations techniques and data analysis . with the discovery of new planetary systems , the already known _",
    "sources ( stellar nucleosynthesis , stellar formation process ) have gained a new perspective and brought new questions .",
    "it is now a fact that stars with giant planets are , on average , richer in metals than those for which no planet was detected ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gonzalez 2006 ) and references therein ) .",
    "some authors suggested that this kind of anomaly may not only involve the content of heavy elements but also some light elements like li , c , n , and o ( ( * ? ? ? * ecuvillon et al .",
    "2006 ) and references therein ) .",
    "other authors found no difference in the abundance of light elements when comparing stars with and without planets ( see ( * ? ? ? * ecuvillon et al .",
    "2004 ) and references therein ) .",
    "the studies above are not conclusive yet .",
    "we need new tests , using more accurate and homogeneous data , with a larger number of stars .",
    "abundances of these elements in solar - like stars will bring new information that will surely help to distinguish the different stellar and planetary formation processes .",
    "this is the purpose of our work , in which we analyzed a sample of 200 stars to homogeneously measure the photospheric parameters and c abundances .",
    "our sample consists of 200 single solar - like stars in the solar neighborhood , observed in high signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath1  200 ) and high resolution ( 42000 ) with the elodie spectrograph ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* baranne et al . 1996 ) ) of the haute provence observatory ( france ) , and for which data are publicly available ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* moultaka et al . 2004 ) ) .",
    "we obtained @xmath2 , [ fe / h ] , log(g ) , and @xmath3 ( through the excitation equilibrium of neutron iron and the ionization equilibrium between fe  i and fe  ii ) .",
    "we also performed spectral synthesis of some regions containing bands of the @xmath4 swan system ( e.g. at @xmath55165 ) , using the moog lte code ( sneden 2000 , http://verdi.as.utexas.edu/moog.html ) .",
    "the present work is still ongoing and we show here our first results : photospheric parameters and c abundances based on the intensity of the @xmath4  ( 0,0 ) band head at @xmath55165 .",
    "a comparison of the photospheric parameters here obtained to those published by other works having stars in common shows a good agreement between the samples .",
    "figure  [ fig ] ( left ) shows the solar spectrum and synthetic spectra for different c abundances .",
    "the right panel shows the diagram [ c / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] , comparing stars with and without planets .",
    "it seems that stars with planets are slightly richer in c than field stars , but a larger number of planetary systems is required to confirm this possibility .",
    "the preliminary results on c abundances are presented here for a large number of nearby solar - like stars , based on homogeneous photospheric parameters obtained from spectra with high signal - to - noise ratio and high resolution .",
    "our analysis used public spectra from the elodie database , which represent about 90% of all data .",
    "the remaining 10% include many stars with detected planets and having many observations that shall be analyzed in the same way as soon as they become available to the scientific community , since they will contribute to more reliable conclusions ."
