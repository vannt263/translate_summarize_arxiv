    "the numerical treatment of nonlinear problems that arise in areas such as fluid mechanics often requires solving large systems of nonlinear equations .",
    "many methods have been proposed that attempt to solve these systems efficiently ; one such class of methods are two - level methods that reduce the computational time .",
    "the computational attractions of the methods are that they require the solution of only a small system of nonlinear equations on coarse mesh and one linear system of equations on fine mesh .",
    "apparently , the two - level method was proposed first in @xcite and used for semilinear elliptic problems .",
    "the method was implemented for the velocity - pressure formulation of the navier - stokes equations in @xcite and for the stream function formulation of the navier - stokes equations in @xcite .",
    "the navier - stokes equations may be solved using either the primitive variable or stream function formulation .",
    "here we use the stream function formulation .",
    "the attractions of the stream function formulation are that the incompressibility constraint is automatically satisfied , the pressure is not present in the weak form , and there is only one scalar unknown to solve for .",
    "the standard weak formulation of the stream function version first appeared in 1979 in @xcite . in this direction ,",
    "cayco and nicolaides @xcite studied a general analysis of convergence for this standard weak formulation .",
    "the goal of this paper is to demonstrate that the two - level method can be implemented to approximate solutions for incompressible viscous flow problems with high reynolds number .",
    "consider the navier - stokes equations describing the flow of an incompressible fluid @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denotes the unknown velocity and pressure field , respectively , in a bounded , simply connected polygonal domain @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 is a given body force and re is the reynolds number .    the introduction of a stream function @xmath5 defined by @xmath6 means that the continuity equation ( [ nse2 ] ) is satisfied identically .",
    "the pressure may then be eliminated from ( [ nse1 ] ) to give @xmath7 where @xmath8 represents the outward unit normal to @xmath9 . in order to write ( [ sf1])-([sf3 ] ) in a variational form",
    ", we define the sobolev spaces @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the space of square integrable functions on @xmath9 and @xmath12 represents differentiation with respect to @xmath13 or @xmath14 . for each @xmath15 , define @xmath16 .",
    "the standard weak form of equations ( [ sf1])-([sf3 ] ) is : @xmath17 where @xmath18",
    "for the standard finite element discretization of ( [ cont_stream_form ] ) we choose subspace @xmath19 .",
    "we then    @xmath20    one can prove existence and uniqueness for the solution of the discrete problem ( [ disc_stream_form ] ) ; see @xcite for low reynolds numbers and see @xcite for high reynolds numbers .",
    "once the finite element spaces are prescribed , the discrete problem ( [ disc_stream_form ] ) reduces to solving a system of nonlinear algebraic equations which has a jacobian which is large , sparse and bounded .",
    "various iterative methods can be used to solve the nonlinear problem ( [ disc_stream_form ] ) .",
    "for example , a standard approach is to use newton s method to linearize ( [ disc_stream_form ] ) for a fixed mesh of size @xmath21 . since only one",
    "fixed mesh spacing is used , we will refer to this approach as a one - level approach . in the next section",
    "we will describe a two - level method for solving the discrete problem ( [ disc_stream_form ] ) .",
    "we consider the approximate solution of ( [ sf1 ] ) by a two - level , finite - element procedure .",
    "let @xmath22 denote two conforming finite - element meshes with @xmath23 .",
    "the method we consider computes an approximate solution @xmath24 in the finite - element space @xmath25 by solving one linear system for the degrees of freedom on @xmath25 .",
    "this particular linear problem requires the construction of a finite - element space @xmath26 upon a very coarse mesh of width @xmath23 , and then the solution of a much smaller system of nonlinear equations for an approximation in @xmath26 .",
    "the solution procedure is then given in algorithm [ two_level_alg ] .",
    "solve the nonlinear system on coarse mesh for @xmath27 : @xmath28 solve the linear system on fine mesh for @xmath29 : @xmath30    the inclusion @xmath19 requires the use of finite - element functions that are continuously differentiable over @xmath9 .",
    "we shall give some examples of finite - element spaces for the stream function formulation   ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "we will impose boundary conditions by setting all the degrees of freedom at the boundary nodes to be zero and the normal derivative equal to zero at all vertices and nodes on the boundary .",
    "* argyis triangle*. the functions are quintic polynomials within each triangle and the 21 degrees of freedom are chosen to be the function value , the first and second derivatives at the vertices , and the normal derivative at the midsides .    *",
    "clough - tocher triangle*. here we subdivide each triangle into three triangles by joining the vertices to the centroid . in each of the smaller triangles ,",
    "the functions are cubic polynomials .",
    "there are then 30 degrees of freedom needed to determine the three different cubic polynomials associated with the three triangles .",
    "eighteen of these are used to ensure that , within the big triangle , the functions are continuously differentiable .",
    "the remaining 12 degrees of freedom are chosen to be the function values and the first derivatives at the vertices and the normal derivative at the midsides .    *",
    "bogner - fox - schmit rectangle*. the functions are bicubic polynomials within each rectangle .",
    "the degrees of freedom are chosen to be the function value , the first derivatives , and the mixed second derivative at the vertices .",
    "we set the function and the normal derivative values equal to zero at all vertices on the boundary .",
    "* bicubic spline rectangle*. the functions are the product of cubic splines .",
    "these functions are bicubic polynomials within each rectangle , are twice continuously differentiable over @xmath9 , and their degrees of freedom are the function values at the nodes ( plus some additional ones on the boundary ) .",
    "the question which automatically arises is how to choose @xmath26 and @xmath25 so that we obtain optimal accuracy .",
    "this question was addressed from a theoretical standpoint in @xcite and the results are summarized below . in @xcite , it was proven that the algorithm produces an approximate solution which satisfies the error bound @xmath31 as an example , consider the case of the clough - tocher triangle . for this element",
    "we have the following inequalities : @xmath32 thus , if we seek an approximate solution @xmath24 with the same asymptotic accuracy as @xmath24 in @xmath33 , the above error bound shows that the superlinear scaling , between coarse and fine meshes , @xmath34 suffices .",
    "analogous scalings between coarse and fine meshes can be calculated from ( [ error ] ) by balancing error terms on the right - hand side of ( [ error ] ) in the same way . for each of the elements described above , we give , in table  [ table1 ] , the scaling between coarse and fine meshes .",

    "in this section we describe some numerical results obtained by implementing the two - level algorithm for which we have an exact solution and the second is the well - known driven cavity problem .",
    "we chose the later problem because there are numerous results in the literature with which to compare .",
    "for both examples , the region @xmath9 is the unit square @xmath43 and for the finite element discretization we use the bogner - fox - schmit elements . in order to compare the efficiency of the proposed method all linear and nonlinear systems were solved in the same way .",
    "all nonlinear problems were solved by newton s method until the norm of the difference in successive iterates and the norm of residual were within a fixed tolerance . in each newton s iteration , we need to solve a linear system . the resulting linear system is non - symmetric whose symmetric part is positive definite . moreover , the resulting matrix is sparse matrix .",
    "we choose the bi - conjugate gradient stabilized method ( bicgstab ) which requires two matrix - vector products and four inner products in each iteration .",
    "bicgstab is given and discussed in  @xcite .",
    "when solving the linearized problem with a mesh spacing @xmath21 we need the solution @xmath44 generated on a mesh with spacing @xmath45 .",
    "to do this we interpolate the solution @xmath44 onto the grid with spacing @xmath21 .",
    "we consider as a test example the 2d navier - stokes equations ( [ nse1])- ( [ nse3 ] ) on the unit square @xmath46 where we define the right hand side by @xmath47 with the following prescribed exact solution @xmath48 for this test problem , all requirements of the theory concerning the geometry of the domain and the smoothness of the data are satisfied .",
