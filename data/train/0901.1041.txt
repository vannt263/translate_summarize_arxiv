    "multicomponent bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) have been subject of growing interest in recent years as they open intriguing possibilities for a number of important physical applications , including coherent storage and processing of optical fields @xcite , quantum simulation @xcite , quantum interferometry _",
    "etc_. experimentally , multicomponent becs can be realized by simultaneous trapping of different species of atoms @xcite or atoms of the same isotope in different hyperfine states .",

    "attractive intracomponent interaction have , on the other hand , received less attention and only one - dimensional vector structures have been studied so far @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional and 3d cases , however , demands special attention since the phenomenon of collapse is possible in attractive becs .",
    "interactions between the atoms in the same and different states can be controlled ( including changing the sign of the interactions ) via a feshbach resonance .",
    "theoretical and experimental studies have shown that inter - component interaction plays a crucial role in dynamics of nonlinear structures in multicomponent becs .",
    "recently , two - component becs with tunable inter - component interaction were realized experimentally @xcite .",
    "note that in nonlinear optics , where similar model equations ( without the trapping potential ) are used to describe the soliton - induced waveguides @xcite , the nonlinear coefficients are always of the same sign .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study 2d nonlinear localized vector structures in the form of soliton - vortex and vortex - vortex pairs in a binary mixture of disc - shaped becs with attractive intracomponent and attractive or repulsive intercomponent interactions .",
    "by means of a linear stability analysis , we investigate the stability of these structures and show that pairs of soliton and single - charged vortex can be stable both for attractive and repulsive interactions between different components .",
