    "ultracompact ( uc ) hii regions are very small ( d@xmath70.1  pc ) , dense ( @xmath8@xmath910@xmath10  @xmath11 ) , and bright ( em@xmath910@xmath12  pc  @xmath13 ) photoionized gas regions ( wood @xmath14 churchwell 1989a ; kurtz , churchwell , @xmath14 wood 1994 ) .",
    "they are thought to represent an early stage of massive - star evolution , such that the newly formed stars are still embedded in their natal molecular clouds .",
    "recently , however , it has been found that most uc  hii  regions are not isolated but surrounded by diffuse extended emission ( koo et al .",
    "1996 ; kim & koo 1996 , 2001 ; kurtz et al .",
    "1999 ) . in kim & koo ( 2001 , hereafter paper  i ) , we did a radio continuum and radio recombination line ( rrl ) survey towards 16 uc  hii  regions with simple morphology and large ratios of single - dish to vla fluxes , and detected extended emission towards all the sources .",
    "the extended emission consists of one to several compact ( @xmath151@xmath16 or 0.5@xmath15 pc ) components and diffuse extended ( 2@xmath16@xmath112@xmath16 or 4@xmath119 pc ) envelope .",
    "all the uc  hii  regions but 2 spherical ones are located in the compact components , where they always correspond to the peaks of their associated compact components .",
    "( this positional coincidence we refer to as ` the compact components with uc  hii  regions ' or ` the compact hii  regions with uc  hii  regions ' throughout this paper . )",
    "moreover , the compact components with uc  hii  regions are smaller and denser than those without uc  hii  regions . based on these morphological relations and rrl observations",
    ", it seems certain that the ultracompact , compact , and extended components in each source are physically associated , and it is likely that they are excited by the same ionizing source .",
    "thus almost all ( 14/16 ) the uc  hii  regions may not be bona - fide ionization - bounded ` uc  hii  regions ' but rather ultracompact cores of more extended hii  regions .",
    "a simple statistical analysis of single - dish to vla flux ratios further suggested that most uc  hii  regions previously known are associated with extended emission like our sources .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to explain how the ultracompact , compact , and extended components , which have very different dynamical time scales , can coexist .    in paper",
    "i , we proposed a model in which the coexistence of the three components can be easily explained by combining the champagne flow model with the hierarchical structure of molecular clouds .",
    "recent high - resolution molecular line observations of massive star - forming regions revealed molecular clumps ( @xmath151  pc ) and hot cores ( @xmath70.1  pc ) therein ( see kurtz et al . 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "the hot cores are likely to be the sites of massive star formation .",
    "an interesting feature is that typical sizes of the hot cores and molecular clumps are , respectively , in rough agreement with those of uc  hii  regions and their associated compact components .",
    "our model suggested , on the basis of these results , that when an o star formed off - center within a hot core embedded in a molecular clump , the hii  region would continue to be ultracompact inside the hot core for a long ( @xmath910@xmath17  yr ) time while it grows to a few 1 pc outside the hot core . in the light of the model",
    ", the coexistence of ultracompact , compact , and extended components does not seem to be unusual for hii  regions that expand in hierarchically clumpy molecular clouds , and the ultracompact and compact components would disappear one by one when the host hot core and then molecular clump are destroyed by the exciting star(s ) . in the past decade",
    "a number of groups have undertaken studies on hot cores and molecular clumps associated with uc  hii  regions ( e.g. , cesaroni et al .",
    "1994 ; garay & rodrguez 1990 ) .",
    "however , there has been no holistic study of the relationship between the three components of hii  regions and their molecular gas counterparts .    in this study",
    ", we made @xmath0co , cs , and c@xmath2s  line observations of molecular clouds associated with the 16 uc  hii  regions with extended envelopes in paper  i. the main scientific goals of our observations are ( 1 ) to explore the physical characteristics of the molecular clouds undergoing active massive star formation , ( 2 ) to investigate how the hii region complexes interact with their parental molecular clouds on diverse length scales , and ( 3 ) to understand the origin of the extended envelopes of uc  hii  regions .",
    "the observational details are described in   2 and the results are presented in   3 .",
    "we discuss the physical properties and star formation of the molecular clouds , the interaction between the ionized and molecular gas , the origin of the extended halos of uc  hii  regions , and the implication of our results for the blister model of hii  regions in ",
    "some individual sources are discussed in   5 .",
    "we conclude with a summary of our main results in the last section .",
    "we have carried out @xmath0co j=1@xmath10  ( 110.20135  ghz ) line observations of molecular clouds associated with the 16 uc  hii  regions studied in paper  iusing the 12 m telescope of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) at kitt peak in 1997 june .",

    "the observations were made with the 14 m telescope of the taeduk radio astronomy observatory ( trao ) , fwhms of which are 60@xmath18 at 98 ghz and 46@xmath18 at 147 ghz .",
    "the line intensity was obtained on the @xmath22  scale from chopper - wheel calibration .",
    "the telescope has main beam efficiencies of 0.48 ( 98 ghz ) and 0.39 ( 147 ghz ) .",
    "all observations were made in the position switching mode with reference positions checked to be free from appreciable cs emission ( table 3 ) .",
    "we used sis mixer receivers with 256 channel filterbanks of 64  mhz bandwidth as the backend .",
    "the velocity resolutions were 0.77  km  s@xmath19  and 0.51  km  s@xmath19  at 98 ghz and 147 ghz , respectively .",

    ", however , it is not difficult to find the velocity component associated with h76@xmath24  rrl emission , the center velocity of which is depicted by the vertical dotted line ( paper  i ) . the h76@xmath24  line is significantly ( @xmath255  km  s@xmath19 ) shifted from the associated @xmath0co  line in 6 sources : g5.97@xmath11.17 , g10.15@xmath10.34 , g10.30@xmath10.15 , g12.21@xmath10.10 , g23.71 + 0.17 , and g27.28 + 0.15 .",

    "thus such a velocity difference between the ionized and molecular gas seems to be a common feature .",

    "the observed @xmath57-@xmath41  relationship with a similar power - law index for the host clouds and cores might be direct evidence supporting the idea .",
    "the molecular clouds in our sample are associated with extended radio hii  regions , each of which consists of an uc  hii  region , compact component(s ) , and diffuse extended envelope . as mentioned in   1 , the uc  hii  regions and their associated compact components are likely to be ionized by the same sources . in case where there are two or more compact components , e.g. , g29.96@xmath10.02 ( fig .",
    "8@xmath64 ) , the compact components may be produced by separate ionizing sources ( paper  i ) .",

    "these molecular clouds appear to form lower - mass stars than our molecular clouds , since the associated hii  regions are usually excited by early b or late o stars .",
    "they have sizes of 10@xmath150  pc , masses of ( 1@xmath17)@xmath3710@xmath10  @xmath4 , and line widths ( fwhms ) of 2@xmath16  km  s@xmath19 . despite similar sizes the molecular clouds in our sample have considerably larger masses and velocity dispersions .",
    "such molecular clouds were also studied in cs j=2@xmath11  line emission ( zinchenko et al .",
    "1994 ; carpenter , snell , & schloerb 1995b ) .",
    "their cs - emitting regions have sizes of 1@xmath15  pc , masses of ( 1@xmath1140)@xmath3710@xmath43  @xmath4 , and line widths ( fwhms ) of 2@xmath13  km  s@xmath19 .",
    "the cs - emitting regions of our molecular clouds are significantly larger , more massive , and more turbulent . in table 5",
    "we give the estimated fraction of the cs - emitting region to the whole cloud in mass and area of our sample .",
    "the cs - emitting regions on average contain 45@xmath2618% of the total mass and occupy 20@xmath268% of the total area .",
    "the measured fractions are much higher than estimates for the nearby molecular clouds with sharpless hii  regions . for example , the mass and area fractions are , respectively , 2% and 1% for the gemini ob1 cloud complex that contains several sharpless hii  regions ( carpenter et al",
    ". 1995b ) .",
    "this result is compatible with the finding of carpenter et al .",
    "( 1995b ) that more luminous @xmath65 sources are in general associated with more massive cs cores in the gemini complex , which strongly implies that more massive stars form in more massive cores .",
    "similar trends have been observed in the l1630 molecular cloud ( lada 1992 ) and the rosette molecular cloud ( phelps & lada 1997 ) as well . in these molecular clouds the embedded clusters are associated with the most massive cores .",
    "thus it was suggested that both high gas density and high gas mass are required for the formation of stellar clusters . in view of this , it is not surprising that our molecular clouds , which form rich stellar clusters and/or very massive single stars , have very massive cs cores .",

    "the extended envelopes can be interpreted as consequences of champagne flows in at least 10 sources in our sample : g5.97@xmath11.17 , g8.14 + 0.23 , g10.15@xmath10.34 , g10.30@xmath10.15 , g12.21@xmath10.10 , g12.43@xmath10.05 , g23.46@xmath10.23 , g23.71 + 0.17 , g23.96 + 0.15 , and g27.28 + 0.15 ( israel 1978 ; tenorio - tagle 1979 ; franco , tenorio - tagle , & bodenheimer 1990 ) .",
    "it should be noted that an obvious anti - correlation between the distributions of the ionized and molecular gas can not be seen unless the inclination of the champagne flow is large , and that low resolution and coarse sampling of our rrl observations prevent us from examining the internal velocity gradient of the ionized gas in the majority of our sources .",
    "the results of this inspection on the individual sources will be discussed in   5 .",
    "we investigate the association between compact hii  regions and @xmath0co  cores from figure 8 .",
    "the vast majority of compact hii  regions are associated with @xmath0co  cores , which are in general the densest ones in the individual sources .",
    "however , the radio continuum peaks and their associated @xmath0co  peaks usually do not overlap .",
    "this is more clearly shown in figure 9 , which is a histogram demonstrating the number of compact hii  regions at each separation interval between the peaks of radio continuum and @xmath0co  intensities .",
    "figure 9 also displays that there may be no significant difference in statistics between the compact hii  regions with and without uc  hii  regions .",
    "we performed a similar analysis for cs cores as well .",
    "all the compact hii regions with uc  hii  regions are intimately related to cs peaks , whereas those without uc  hii  regions are mainly shifted from the peaks ( see , e.g. , figs .",
    "3@xmath74 & 3@xmath87 ) .",
    "cs gas was detected only at the positions of uc  hii  regions in the sources not mapped , as said earlier .",
    "we did not analyze statistically the separation of the radio continuum peaks and the associated cs peaks , because the sampling interval ( 60@xmath18 ) of our cs line maps is comparable to or larger than the typical angular separation between the two peaks .      in paper",
    "i  we suggested a simple model to explain the origin of the extended envelopes of uc  hii  regions ( see also   1 ) . in the model the extended envelopes are produced by champagne flows originating from hot cores of molecular clouds .",
    "however , we could not completely exclude the possibility that they are formed during the initial ionization of hii  regions .",
    "this is possible if hot cores and molecular clumps are so clumpy that ultraviolet ( uv ) photons can propagate a few 1  pc from the central stars .",
    "how can we distinguish between the two possibilities ?",
    "for doing this it seems to be important to compare in detail the ionized gas distribution in the envelopes with the ambient molecular gas distribution .",
    "the extended envelopes are expected to stretch out in the direction of decreasing molecular gas density in both cases .",
    "if they were formed very soon after the central stars turned on , the density distribution of ionized gas would be very similar to that of molecular gas because it is not yet significantly affected by dynamical evolution .",
    "on the contrary , the two density distributions could be substantially different each other if the extended envelopes were formed by champagne flows . in this context ,",
    "our data appear to support the champagne flow model . in g8.14",
    "+ 0.23 at a distance of 4.2  kpc , for example , the ionized gas protuberances extend into molecular gas hollows that lie north and south of the central dense core ( fig .",
    "8@xmath74 ) .",
    "we can also see similar features in other sources at relatively small ( @xmath74@xmath886  kpc ) distances , such as the eastern part of g10.15@xmath10.34 and the northern part of g10.30@xmath10.15 ( fig .",
    "8@xmath89 ) .",
    "in particular , a velocity variation of @xmath1510  km  s@xmath19  was actually observed along @xmath90 in the extended envelope of g10.15@xmath10.34 ( kim & koo 2002 ) .",
    "there is sometimes a significant velocity difference between the rrl and molecular line emission observed towards each uc  hii  region .",
    "the rrl width is generally larger in the compact hii  regions , especially the ones with uc  hii  regions , than in the extended envelopes ( paper  i ; garay & rodrguez 1983 )",
    ". these might be also strong arguments in favor of the champagne flow model , even though detailed comparison of radio continuum and rrl data with molecular line data at a higher resolution is needed to clarify this issue .",
    "we found in paper  i  that the compact hii  regions with uc  hii  regions are smaller and denser than those without uc  hii  regions , and proposed that the former might be in an earlier evolutionary phase than the latter .",
    "since massive stars emit strong uv radiation , stellar winds , and energetic bipolar outflows even at the earliest evolutionary stage , the host dense cores should be disrupted with time .",
    "thus our suggestion matches with that the compact hii  regions with uc  hii  regions are more closely associated with cs peaks than those without uc  hii  regions .",
    "these observations are consistent with our model . on the other hand , two spherical uc  hii  regions in our sample , g23.46@xmath10.23 and g25.72 + 0.05 , have no associated compact hii  regions ( figs .",
    "8@xmath91 & 8@xmath92 ) .",
    "g25.72 + 0.02 is coincident with a @xmath0co  core and has detectable cs emission only at the uc  hii  region position , but g23.46@xmath10.20 is significantly offset from the nearby @xmath0co  and cs peaks ( figs .",
    "2@xmath91 & 3@xmath47 ) .",
    "the absence of associated dense core and compact hii  region indicates that g23.46@xmath10.23 may be an externally ionized dense clump .",
    "in contrast , g25.72 + 0.05 is likely to be the only bina - fide ionization - bounded uc  hii  region out of the 16 uc  hii  regions in our sample . +      zuckerman ( 1973 ) for the first time suggested that the orion nebula is a blister - like hii  region located on the near edge of an associated molecular cloud .",
    "after that israel ( 1978 ) found from a comparison of optical hii  regions and molecular clouds that the majority of hii  regions in his sample have similar structures to the orion nebula and further proposed that the formation of massive stars occur near the surfaces of molecular clouds ( see also israel 1976 , 1977 ) .",
    "subsequent numerical simulations successfully demonstrated that such a blister - like morphology of hii  regions can be produced by champagne flows derived by density contrast between molecular clouds and intercloud medium and/or strong negative density gradient in molecular clouds ( e.g. , tenorio - tagle 1979 ; franco et al .",
    ". however , waller et al . (",
    "1987 ) showed by comparing radio hii  regions and molecular clouds that radio hii  regions are preferentially concentrated toward the centers of molecular clouds , and argued that the result conflicts with the blister picture .    on the other hand ,",
    "our data show that the compact ( and ultracompact ) components of hii  regions are closely associated with dense cores of molecular clouds .",
    "since most of the dense cores are deeply embedded in molecular clouds , it is likely that massive stars in general form in the interiors rather than on the surfaces of molecular clouds .",
    "this is consistent with what waller et al .",
    "( 1987 ) found .",
    "however , our data strongly suggest that the diffuse extended envelopes of hii  regions are produced by champagne flows .",
    "thus the blister picture appears to be still applicable to most hii regions .",
    "it seems possible because massive star - forming molecular clouds have hierarchical structure and are of irregular morphology . in view of our model ,",
    "the peaks of optical hii  regions are likely to be located around the edges of associated molecular clouds not because the exciting star(s ) formed there , but because the side of the molecular cloud had already been disrupted by champagne flows .",
    "this molecular cloud provides a good example showing that the molecular clouds in our sample are very clumpy and of irregular morphology ( fig .",
    "2@xmath85 ) .",
    "the molecular cloud is moderately elongated in the northwest - southeast direction on the whole and is largely divided into three components : central , northwestern , and southeastern ones . apparently massive star formation is ongoing only in the central component .",
    "the central component has two dense cores , which are associated with the strong compact components in the radio continuum ( fig .",
    "8@xmath85 ) .",
    "the uc  hii  region is located in the western denser core , which is consistent with the idea that the compact components with uc  hii  regions are in an earlier evolutionary stage than those without uc  hii  regions .      among our sources",
    "this is the nearest ( 1.9  kpc ) one and so the molecular cloud reveals very well the clumpy structure ( fig .",
    "2@xmath93 ) .",
    "the cloud is composed of an extended ( @xmath156@xmath16@xmath3710@xmath16 ) component and an arclike structure , which emanates from the former to the southeast .",
    "the arclike structure has radio continuum counterpart ( fig .",
    "8@xmath93 ) .",
    "the uc  hii  region is associated with a weak dense core , which resides at the edge of the central component .",
    "the strongest @xmath0co  core is located northwest of the cloud but shows no indication of ongoing massive star formation in radio and mid - infrared continuum emission ( crowther & conti 2003 ) . as pointed out in paper  i , our extended radio hii  region is the dense part of the well - known lagoon nebula ( m8 ) .",
    "it seems that the dense part is ionized mainly by herschel 36 ( o7 ) , nearly corresponding to the uc  hii  region in position , while more extended optical nebulosity is excited by other o stars , including 9  sgr ( o4(f ) ) ( elliot et al .",
    "the ionized gas is significantly (",
    "@xmath95  km  s@xmath19 ) blue - shifted from the molecular gas ( fig .",
    "1@xmath93 and table 5 of paper  i ) , which indicates that the hii  region is on the front edge of the host molecular cloud and the ionized gas is approaching the earth with respect to the molecular cloud , as proposed by lada et al .",
    "the star 9 sgr is located about 3@xmath16 east of uc  hii  region , i.e. , @xmath94= ( @xmath95 , @xmath96 ) .",
    "thus the eastern hollow may have been produced by strong uv radiation and stellar winds from the star 9 sgr .",
    "consequently , the molecular cloud seems to have been considerably disrupted by o stars therein .",
    "this is compatible with the fact that the molecular cloud has a much higher sfe , 7.0% , in comparison with other clouds in our sample ( table 6 ) .",
    "the molecular cloud is largely extended in the northeast - southwest direction , but the central dense part is elongated in the east - west direction ( figs 2@xmath74 & 3@xmath97 ) .",
    "the uc  hii  region is placed in the flattened dense core , a little west of the peak , which strongly supports that the bipolar morphology of hii  region is the result of champagne flows originating from a thin molecular cloud ( see   4.2 ) . in the view of the model presented in paper  i , this object is a good example of bipolar blister - type hii  regions observed at a viewing angle close to 90@xmath98 .",
    "this region is known as the w31 hii  region / molecular cloud complex .",
    "the molecular cloud seems to be an incomplete shell , being open to the northwest , on the whole ( fig .",
    "2@xmath89 ) .",
    "the two uc  hii  regions are located in the southern spherical dense region and in the northern flat one , respectively .",
    "we found convincing observational evidence that their extended ionized envelopes have been produced by champagne flows ( e.g. , see fig .",
    "8@xmath89 ) .",
    "a detailed radio and infrared study on this region was presented in a separate paper ( kim &  koo 2002 ) .",
    "the uc  hii  region is situated outside the @xmath0co  core , although it has an associated compact component in the radio continuum ( fig .",
    "8@xmath47 ) .",
    "we have detected weak ( @xmath22@xmath450.3  k ) cs j=2@xmath11  line emission only at the position of the uc  hii  region ( fig .",
    "1@xmath91 ) .",
    "the associated compact component is the largest and most diffuse among the 14 compact components with uc  hii  regions in our sample ( see tables 3 & 4 of paper  i ) . in the picture of our model , it may suggest that the natal hot core has been almost destroyed by the ionizing star(s ) .",
    "thus the compact component is likely on the verge of being one without ultracompact core .",
    "g23.46@xmath10.20 is one of the two spherical uc  hii  regions that have no associated compact components in the radio continuum images .",
    "it is located near the boundary of extended envelope ( fig .",
    "8@xmath91 ) .",
    "there are no associated @xmath0co  or cs cores as well ( figs .",
    "2@xmath91 & 3@xmath47 ) .",
    "therefore , g23.46@xmath10.20 might be a dense clump externally ionized by nearby luminous stars .",
    "the molecular cloud is roughly extended in the northwest - southeast direction , while the diffuse envelope of hii  region is elongated in the east - west direction . according to rrl data obtained in paper  i ,",
    "the northern and western parts are blue - shifted by @xmath154  km  s@xmath19from the central region , which has approximately the same ( @xmath15104  km  s@xmath19 ) center velocity as the molecular gas ( fig .",
    "1@xmath46 ) .",
    "these observations may indicate that the extended envelope is the result of champagne flows .",
    "the uc  hii  region corresponds to the peak of an extended hii  region whose compact component is associated with a @xmath0co  core ( fig 8@xmath46 ) .",
    "cs j=2@xmath11 and j=3@xmath12 emission were detected only towards the uc  hii   region ( table 3 ) . the h76@xmath24  line ( 103.0  km  s@xmath19 ) is blueshifted from the @xmath0co  and cs lines by about 12  km  s@xmath19  ( fig 1@xmath99 ) , suggesting that the hii  region may be located on the near edge of the molecular cloud",
    "the situation is very similar to g5.17@xmath11.17 (   5.2 ) or the orion nebula ( zuckerman 1973 ) , even if this object is at a much larger ( 9  kpc ) distance .",
    "the viewing angle does not seem to be very small because the diffuse envelope of the hii  region is more extended to the northeast .",
    "these two uc  hii  regions are located in @xmath0co  and cs cores .",
    "the molecular clouds are elongated in the north - south direction , while the diffuse envelopes of hii  regions fairly extended in the perpendicular direction ( figs 8@xmath99 & 8@xmath100 ) .",
    "thus the extended envelopes can be interpreted as champagne flows .",
    "however , we could not observe any internal velocity gradient due to low ( fwhm@xmath452@xmath16 ) angular resolution of rrl observations .",
    "the uc  hii  region is associated with a local @xmath0co  peak , whereas it is located in the strongest cs peak ( figs 2@xmath64 & 3@xmath99 ) .",
    "the dense region of the molecular cloud is somewhat elongated in the northeast - southwest direction . in the channel maps of both @xmath0co  and cs line data , a significant ( @xmath158  km  s@xmath19 ) velocity gradient is present .",
    "strong @xmath0co- and cs - emitting regions move from northeast to southwest as the velocity increases from @xmath44@xmath4592  km  s@xmath19  to 100  km  s@xmath19 .",
    "we can find a similar velocity gradient in the rrls taken in approximately full - beam spacing along @xmath24(1950 ) @xmath101 @xmath102 ( see table 5 of paper  i ) .",
    "we carried out @xmath0co j=1@xmath10 , cs , and c@xmath2s j=2@xmath11 and j=3@xmath12 line observations of the parental molecular clouds of 16 uc  hii  regions with extended envelopes , which give rise to rich stellar clusters and/or very massive ( o7@xmath1o4 ) stars .",
    "the molecular clouds in our sample are very clumpy and of irregular morphology .",
    "our molecular clouds and dense cores usually have much larger masses and velocity dispersions than those associated with sharpless hii  regions that are ionized by early b or late o stars .",
    "the cs - emitting regions on average contain @xmath1545% of the total cloud mass and occupy @xmath1520% of the total area for the 10 sources mapped in the cs j=2@xmath11 line .",
    "the estimated fractions are one order of magnitude higher than the values for the molecular clouds that form early b or late o stars .",
    "this result is consistent with the earlier findings for smaller dense cores that more massive stars form in more massive cores .",
    "@xmath0co  cores are in general associated with compact hii  regions regardless of the presence of uc  hii  regions therein , while cs cores are preferentially associated with those with uc  hii  regions . along with the fact that the compact hii  regions with uc  hii  regions are more compact than those without uc  hii  regions ,",
    "this strongly suggests that the former are in an earlier evolutionary stage than the latter .",
    "the extended envelopes of hii  regions tend to develop towards molecular regions of low density .",
    "it was found in some sources at relatively small ( @xmath74@xmath886  kpc ) distances that the density distribution of ionized gas in the envelopes is substantially different from that of the ambient molecular gas , indicating that the ionized gas distribution have been significantly affected by dynamical evolution .",
    "thus it seems likely that the extended envelopes have been formed by champagne flows rather than the initial ionization , although higher - resolution radio continuum , molecular line , and especially rrl observations are required to clarify this issue .",
    "based on the morphological comparison of hii  regions and molecular clouds , the velocity gradient in h76@xmath24  line emission , and the velocity difference between h76@xmath24  and molecular lines , the extended ionized envelopes are likely to be the consequences of champagne flows in at least 10 sources in our sample .",
    "together , these results appear to support our model that explains the presence of low - density halos of uc  hii  regions by combining the champagne flow model with the hierarchical structure of molecular clouds , taking into account various inclinations and low resolutions of our data .",
    "our results do not imply , however , that the formation of massive stars takes place near the surfaces of molecular clouds as proposed by the original blister model of hii  regions ( israel 1978 ) .",
    "instead , since the uc and compact components of hii  regions mainly correspond to the dense cores embedded in molecular clouds , massive stars seem to form in the interiors of molecular clouds .",
    "nevertheless , the diffuse extended envelopes of hii  regions can be produced by champagne flows because massive star - forming molecular clouds have hierarchical structure and irregular morphology .",

    "<S> they usually have much larger masses , velocity dispersions , and fractions of dense gas than molecular clouds that form early b or late o stars . </S>",
    "<S> this is compatible with earlier findings that more massive stars form in more massive cores . </S>",
    "<S> the ir luminosity - to - mass ratio has a mean value of 9  @xmath3/@xmath4and is little correlated with the cloud mass . </S>",
    "<S> most molecular clouds have star formation efficiencies ( sfe s ) of 1%@xmath12% . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath0co  cores are in general associated with compact hii  regions regardless of the presence of uc  hii  regions therein . in contrast , cs cores are preferentially associated with compact hii  regions that contain uc  hii  regions . as with the fact that the compact hii  regions containing uc  hii  regions are more compact than those not associated with uc  hii  regions , these indicate that the former may be in an earlier evolutionary phase than the latter . </S>",
    "<S> the diffuse extended envelopes of hii  regions often develop in the direction of decreasing molecular gas density . based on detailed comparison of molecular line data with radio continuum and recombination line data , </S>",
    "<S> the extended ionized envelopes are likely the results of champagne flows in at least 10 sources in our sample . </S>",
    "<S> together these results appear to support a published suggestion that the extended emission around uc  hii  regions can be naturally understood by combining the champagne flow model with the hierarchical structure of molecular clouds , taking into account various inclinations and low resolutions of our data . </S>",
    "<S> additionally the blister model seems to be still applicable to most hii  regions , even though massive stars usually form in the interiors rather than on the surfaces of molecular clouds . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible because massive star - forming clouds have hierarchical structure and irregular morphology . </S>"
