    "non - unitarity of the leptonic mixing matrix at low energies is a generic manifestation of new physics in the lepton sector often related to the mechanism responsible for the generation of neutrino masses .",
    "non - unitarity appears whenever additional heavy particles mix with the light neutrinos or their charged lepton partners . after integrating the heavy states out of the theory ,",
    "the @xmath4 submatrix of the light neutrinos remains as an effective mixing matrix .",
    "this low - energy leptonic mixing matrix is , in general , not unitary .",
    "one example where non - unitarity is predicted is the generic type - i seesaw mechanism  @xcite , where the standard model ( sm ) is extended by ( typically three ) right - handed neutrinos",
    ". if the type - i seesaw mechanism operates at energies as high as the grand unification scale ( gut scale ) , then non - unitarity effects are tiny . however , if the seesaw mechanism is realized at low energies close to the electroweak scale , then non - unitarity is enhanced and can be observable",
    ". it may then provide important hints to the origin of neutrino masses .",
    "it is important to note that , in low - energy seesaw scenarios , the smallness of the neutrino masses is not explained by the largeness of the seesaw scale",
    ". however it can be explained in a technically natural way by a lepton number symmetry which is broken only by a small amount @xcite .",
    "while the neutrino masses in the type - i seesaw mechanism are effectively described by the unique lepton number violating weinberg operator of @xmath1 , the non - unitarity of the leptonic mixing matrix is generated by the lepton number conserving @xmath2 operator contributing to the kinetic terms of the neutrinos @xcite . in low - energy seesaw scenarios with approximately conserved lepton number",
    ", the @xmath2 operator can cause significant effects , since it is not suppressed by the smallness of the neutrino masses .",
    "one attractive feature of the seesaw mechanism is that it can explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe via the mechanism of leptogenesis  @xcite ( for a recent review , see ref .",
    "if the seesaw mechanism , and thus also the mechanism of thermal leptogenesis , operates at high energies , the decay asymmetries for leptogenesis are typically dominated by the @xmath1 operator . unfortunately the high - energy parameters which control leptogenesis can not be fully reconstructed from the measurements at low energy , since combinations of the yukawa couplings different from those in the @xmath1 operator also appear .    on the other hand , if the seesaw mechanism operates at lower energies , predicting an observable non - unitarity of the leptonic mixing matrix , one may in principle obtain enough information from low - energy measurements to reconstruct the full lagrangian and , therefore , the parameters that control leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to clarify the relation between the high - energy parameters that control successful leptogenesis and their low - energy manifestations , _",
    "i.e. _ , neutrino masses and mixings and deviations from unitarity of the leptonic mixing matrix , making special emphasis on the latter . in section [ sec : reconstruction ] we describe in detail the method and conditions under which the full high - energy lagrangian can be reconstructed from the low - energy effects . in section [ sec : model ] we introduce a `` minimalistic '' low - scale seesaw model with three right - handed neutrinos in which the smallness of neutrino masses is explained by an approximate lepton number symmetry .",
    "however , deviations from unitary mixing induced by the @xmath2 operator are not protected by the symmetry and can be sizeable , leading to effects that could , in principle , be tested in precision electroweak measurements . in section [ sec : lepto ] we discuss how , in this model , leptogenesis could be driven by the @xmath2 operator that induces the deviation from unitary mixing via flavoured leptogenesis . in section [ sec : equilibration ] we point out that the same @xmath2 operator that drives flavoured leptogenesis can also lead to a flavour equilibration , which could wash out the generation of lepton number .",

    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] , we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "in this section we describe how the full lagrangian of the type - i seesaw can , in principle , be reconstructed from the low - energy observations of neutrino masses and mixings , including deviations from unitary mixing .",

    "we conclude that , in the considered scenario , successful leptogenesis is incompatible with observable non - unitarity signals .",
    "we have investigated the relation between non - unitarity of the leptonic mixing matrix and baryogenesis via thermal leptogenesis .",
    "we have first studied how all parameters of the canonical type - i seesaw mechanism can , in principle , be reconstructed from the neutrino mass matrix and a measurement of the deviation of the effective low - energy leptonic mixing matrix from unitary . in the effective low - energy theory , neutrino masses and non - unitarity",
    "are encoded in the lepton number violating @xmath1 ( weinberg ) operator and in the @xmath2 operator contributing to the neutrino kinetic terms after electroweak symmetry breaking , respectively .    for the case",
    "that the mass @xmath0 of the lightest right - handed neutrino is lighter than the masses of the others , we show that its decay asymmetries for flavour - dependent leptogenesis can be expressed in terms of two contributions , one depending on the unique @xmath1 operator generating neutrino masses and one depending on the @xmath2 operator associated with non - unitarity .",
    "we have argued that in low - energy seesaw scenarios , where small lepton number violation explains the smallness of neutrino masses , the lepton number conserving @xmath2 operator contribution , linked to non - unitarity , generically dominates over the @xmath1 operator contribution which results in a strong enhancement of the flavour - dependent decay asymmetries without any resonance effects .",
    "we have referred to this case as _ non - unitarity driven leptogenesis_.    to calculate the produced final baryon asymmetry , however , we found that lepton flavour equilibrating effects directly related to non - unitarity play a crucial role and their effects have to be included . in the simple realization of non - unitarity driven leptogenesis considered here ,",
    "they turn out to forbid lowering the leptogenesis scale down to the tev scale . nevertheless , lowering of the leptogenesis scale , _",
    "i.e. _ , the mass of the lightest right - handed neutrino @xmath0 , to about @xmath3  gev is possible , which is more than one order of magnitude below the scale of standard thermal leptogenesis .",
    "the reduced leptogenesis scale in non - unitarity driven leptogenesis can improve consistency between leptogenesis and gravitino ( or similar ) constraints in supergravity theories . on the other hand , the deviation from unitarity for the case of @xmath210  gev is far below the experimentally accessible region .",
