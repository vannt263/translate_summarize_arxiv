    "the analysis measured the upper limit 4.3% at 95% confidence level and found an unexpected result : the @xmath0 mass distribution of 1496 annihilations at rest @xmath8 had a narrow peak at about 755 mev/@xmath3 .",
    "this distribution is shown in fig .",
    "1a .    a @xmath9 fit of this distribution found that the peak had a significance of about 4.5 standard deviations ( sd ) and a width lower than the experimental resolution .",

    "the properties of the annihilations were undestood at the beginning of 1990s @xcite .",
    "a reanalysis of the rsc data proved that this reaction is dominated by the channel @xmath12 followed by the @xmath13 decay into @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 indicates the @xmath0 @xmath17 s - wave interaction .",

    "1b , togheter with the rsc distribution normalized to the obelix combinations ( crosses ) .",
    "this figure shows that the @xmath0 distributions of both experiments are in agreement with the only exception of the peak at 755 mev/@xmath3 that is not shown by the obelix data . at that time , the absence of the peak in the obelix data confirmed the opinion that the rsc peak was a fluctuation .",

    "figure  1a shows the prediction of this fit ( solid lines ) and of the polynomial background of the same fit ( dotted line ) .",
    "of the peak in the obelix @xmath0 mass distributions can have two explanations : ( i ) the rsc peak was a fluctuation ; ( ii ) the obelix collaboration did not see the peak because the detector had a resolution poorer than our bubble chamber experiment .",
    "the explanation ( i ) seems improbable because the unbinned maximum likelihood fits with the signals parametrizations ( b ) and ( c ) have the significance 5.2 sd .",
    "the explanation ( ii ) is possible because the obelix detector measured the charged pion tracks after they had traveled through the liquid hydrogen of the target and the material of the cryogenic vessel .",
    "an indication that the obelix collaboration could not have seen the peak because a poorer resolution is given by smoothing the rsc distribution .",
    "the solid line in fig .",
    "1b shows the convolution obtained by substituting a gaussian having @xmath11 mev/@xmath3 to all the @xmath0 masses of the rsc sample .",

    "there is a more convincing argument that supports the explanation ( ii ) .",
    "the @xmath0 mass distribution is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the amplitude of reaction that depends on the @xmath0 mass @xmath41 and on a set @xmath42 of other kinematical variables , @xmath43 is the element of the phase space volume , @xmath44 is the phase space distribution , and @xmath45 is the value of @xmath46 mediated on the variables @xmath42 . @xmath45 is the ratio between the experimental distribution and the phase space ( redps ) @xmath47    figure  3a shows this ratio for the rsc data .",
    "it has two maxima : one at about 755 mev/@xmath3 , and the other at about 1250 mev/@xmath3 .",
    "the first maximum is generated by the peak under study , the second is probably due to the production of the @xmath48 meson .",
    "this ratio shows also an ankle at the @xmath49 threshold and does not show any evidence for the debated @xmath50 meson .",
    "fig  3b shows the redps of the obelix data .",
    "it has the same behaviour shown by the redps of the rsc , and confirm the peaking at about 755 mev/@xmath3 .",
    "but its maximum is wider than that of the rsc and is not reproduced by the prediction of fit f.     mass distibution and the phase space predictions .",

    "( b ) ratio of the obelix data . in both diagrams",
    "the dashed line is the prediction of the fit made in ref.@xcite , the solid line is the prediction of the unbinned maximum likelihood fit of the rsc data with the formulae and , and the dotted line is the polinomial background estimated by the same fit . ]",
    "redps distributions prove that there is an amplitude peaking at about 755 mev/@xmath3 .",
    "this peaking can not be generated by a reflection because no significative correlations were found between the @xmath0 peak and other mass and angular distributions .",
    "the low mass suggests that it can not have @xmath51 .",
    "furthermore , the redps peak is too narrow for being produced by the @xmath52 resonance and its mass is 25 mev/@xmath3 far from that of the @xmath53 meson .",
    "lastly , the peak can not be due to the @xmath54 interference .",
    "in fact , the annihilations are dominated by the s - wave initial states @xcite . because the g - parity conservation , the channel @xmath55 is generated by the @xmath56 state , while the channel @xmath57 is generated by the @xmath58 state .",
    "these states can not interfere because they are not coherent .    therefore , the best hypothesis is that the peak is generated by the @xmath6 interaction .",
    "it could be generated by an unknown scalar meson or could be a property of the @xmath16 interaction that was not reproduced in the previous analysis @xcite .",
    "in fact , the phase - shits parametrization shown in fig .  2a is below @xmath59 till up 862 mev/@xmath3 .",
    "this hypothesis sugests that the peak could be reproduced by forcing the phase shift parametrization to pass at @xmath59 at 757.4 mev/@xmath60 .",
    "unfortunately , the events of the rsc are too low for allowing a convincing study of the effects of the variations of the @xmath17 s - wave amplitude .",
    "fit f measures the following parameters for the narrow @xmath0 peak shown in fig .",
    "1a @xmath61 where the systematic error has been evaluated by using the mean of the difference between the parameters found in fit f and those measured in the other five fits .",
    "the mass @xmath62 is close to the values measured by troyan et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there is no evidence for double peak production in the same event .",
    "therefore , one evaluates from that the fraction of the channel @xmath63 in the @xmath64 is @xmath65 since the frequency of the annihilation at rest is @xmath66 @xcite , the frequency of the peak is @xmath67 = \\frac{n}{1496 } \\ ,   f(\\bar{p } n \\rightarrow 2 \\pi^+ 3 \\pi^- ) =         ( 1.03 \\pm 0.21_{\\rm stat } \\pm 0.21_{\\rm sys})\\% .\\ ] ]",
