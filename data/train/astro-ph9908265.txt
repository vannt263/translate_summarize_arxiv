    "( 1999 , henceforth crn99 ) performed an h@xmath0 objective - prism survey in the chamaeleon i dark cloud , a site of on - going and/or recent low- and intermediate - mass star formation , and presented six new low - mass late - type ( @xmath2 m6 ) objects with h@xmath0 emission , called cha  h@xmath0 1 to 6 . their strong h@xmath0 emission , if having the same origin as in t  tauri stars ( tts ) , is an indicator of youth , and therefore of membership to the star forming region at @xmath3 pc .",
    "luminosities obtained from vijhk photometry made it possible to place the objects in the h - r diagram where , according to different sets of pre - main sequence evolutionary tracks , they all lie near or below the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy with high s / n of the lowest - mass object , cha  h@xmath0  1 , confirmed its sub - stellar nature ( neuhuser & comern 1998 , henceforth nc98 ) and allowed an accurate determination of its spectral type to be m7.5-m8 .",
    "comparision with evolutionary tracks and isochrones yielded a mass of @xmath4 and an age of @xmath5  myrs .",
    "cha  h@xmath0  1 is the first brown dwarf ( bd ) detected in x - rays ( nc98 ) .",
    "young brown dwarfs were also found in other star forming regions , namely @xmath6 oph ( rieke & rieke 1990 ; comern et al .",
    "1993 , 1998 ; luhman et al . 1997 ; wilking et al .",
    "1999 ) , taurus ( luhman et al . 1998 ; briceo et al .",
    "1998 ; white et al . 1999 ; reid & hawley 1999 ) , and orion ( bjar et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the sub - stellar nature of suspected brown dwarfs can usually be confirmed by detection of lithium 6708  absorption , because lithium is burned rapidly and fully by proton capture in low - mass , i.e. fully convective stars ( magazz et al .",
    "1993 ) with masses above @xmath7 .",
    "this lithium test can not be applied to very young objects , which are not old enough , yet , to have burned all their initial lithium : for example , objects younger than @xmath8 myr with a mass below @xmath9 have burned less than @xmath10 of their original lithium , and the percentage is even lower for less massive objects of the same age ( dantona & mazzitelli 1997 , baraffe et al .",
    "1998 , and a. burrows , private communication ) . for this reason",
    ", a lithium detection in the spectrum of a suspected brown dwarf member of a star forming region does not directly confirm its substellar character , but it does support strongly its membership in the star forming region ( the alternative possibility , namely the object is evolved and foreground , automatically implies that it is a brown dwarf because of the lithium detection ) .",
    "once such membership and , hence , distance is established , the mass can be inferred from the spectral type and luminosity by comparison to theoretical evolutionary tracks for very low mass objects .    in this paper , we present medium - resolution spectra of cha  h@xmath0  1 to 6 , two additional late m - type objects ( cha h@xmath0 7 and 8) , also first detected in an h@xmath0 objective prism survey ( comern et al . , in preparation ) , as well as four m - type tts in cha i. signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) and resolution of these new spectra are better than those in crn99 , so that we can investigate not only h@xmath0 emission , but also lithium absorption and radial velocities .",

    "the spectra were obtained in the nights of 17 and 18 april 1999 at the 3.5m - new technology telescope ( ntt ) of the european southern observatory ( eso ) on la silla with the eso multi mode instrument ( emmi ) in the red medium dispersion mode .",
    "grating @xmath66 was used covering the range 6485 to 7105 , providing a dispersion of 0.32  per each 0.27 `` pixel ( ccd  @xmath67 ) , and a resolution of @xmath68 5800 ( with the 1.0 '' slit used ) .",
    "one or several spectra were obtained for each object , with exposure time and number of spectra according to the measured instrumental throughput and the available r - band photometry . to keep the cosmic ray density in the resulting images reasonably low , the longest exposure times per frame were never longer than 45 min , always placing two objects into the 330 \" long slit .",
    "each spectrum was extracted individually from the corresponding bias - subtracted , flat - fielded two - dimensional image using tasks in the apextract package layered on iraf .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed by obtaining spectra of a he - ar lamp immediately before and after each individual exposure , to ensure that wavelength shifts due to the rotation of the instrument during the exposure in the nasmyth focus were kept to a minimum .",
    "a full dispersion solution was obtained for one of the he - ar spectra , which was then used as the master wavelength calibration frame . zero - point shifts with respect to this spectrum",
    "were then obtained for each of the other he - ar lamp exposures and applied to the extracted spectra of the targets .",
    "these zero - point shifts were based on spectra of the calibration lamp extracted over a narrow range of rows of the detector centered on the position of the object . in this way",
    ", the determined shifts included the corrections due both to flexures of the instrument , and to the slight curvature of the spectral lines across the surface of the detector , which amounts to a significant four - pixel difference between the center and the edges .",
    "correction for telluric features was performed by observing the bright star @xmath69 cha at intervals of about 2.5 hours per night .",
    "the high rotation velocity of this star ( 255  km / s , hoffleit et al .",
    "1982 ) allows an easy separation between the narrow telluric and the broad photospheric lines .",
    "the spectra of @xmath69 cha were interpolated linearly in the wavelength intervals containing photospheric lines .",
    "then , each individual spectrum of our targets was ratioed by the one of @xmath69 cha obtained at the most similar airmass .",
    "the next step was the modification of the wavelength axis of each object to correct for the observer s motion with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) .",
    "the lsr velocities for each object were computed with the rvcorrect task under iraf , and the spectra were then accordingly doppler - shifted .",
    "finally , all the wavelength - calibrated , telluric - corrected spectra in the lsr frame for each object were added together to produce the combined spectra ( fig .",
    "radial velocities are derived by fourier cross - correlation using the 6600 to 7100  part of the spectrum of chxr 74 as a reference template .",
    "the zero - point is derived from the lithium doublet , using 6707.815  as central wavelength . the quality and s / n of the spectra were insufficient , however , to obtain reliable rotational velocities .",
    "results are listed in table 1 .",
    "in addition , we obtained ground - based , high - s / n , low - resolution optical and infrared spectra over a much broader wavelength range than shown in fig . 1 or in crn99 , in order to better constrain the spectral types of the cha h@xmath0 objects , as well as additional photometry and iso data , all of which are to be presented elsewhere ( comern et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "spectral types  as listed in table 1  are determined by comparison with late m - type standards ( kirkpatrick et al .",
    "1991 , 1995 ) and spectra indices as in crn99 .",
    "we converted them to effective temperatures @xmath58 using the relation recently presented by luhman ( 1999 ) for young m - type objects in ic 348 .",
    "to investigate kinematic membership to cha i , we compare the radial velocities of our objects with those of known tts members of cha i and the local molecular gas , both having lsr radial velocities peaking at @xmath70 km / s with a @xmath71 scatter of @xmath72 km / s ( dubath et al .",
    "1996 , covino et al .",
    "1997 , see also our fig .",
    "the tts observed here also have such velocities .",
    "hence , within the errors , cha  h@xmath0  1 to 8 all have radial velocities in this range , i.e. are kinematic members of the cha i association ( see fig .",
    "cha i membership can also be investigated by looking for youth signatures , such as h@xmath0 emission or lithium absorption .",
    "gravity sensitive features and thermal infrared excess emission observed by isocam will be discussed in a companion paper ( comern et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .    for most of our objects , @xmath61 is variable by a factor of @xmath73 , comparing the results from crn99 with our data .",
    "this can be taken as indication for strong chromospheric activity , i.e. young age .",
    "furthermore , cha h@xmath0 1 , 3 , and 6 , classified here as bona - fide bds , are x - ray sources ( nc98 ) , an indication for magnetic activity , i.e. youth .    comparing @xmath13(li ) of our candidate and bona - fide bds with tts ( fig .",
    "3 ) shows that the lithium strength seems to drop after m5 ( b 34 , @xmath74 ) and to increase again from @xmath68 m7 to m8 .",
    "however , objects with @xmath75 , i.e. @xmath76 , burn less than @xmath10 of their initial lithium in the first @xmath68 10 myrs , so that the apparent gap may be due either to missing objects or to an effect of molecular lines ( eg .",
    "tio in late m - type objects ) on the lithium curves - of - growth , i.e. on how the lithium abundance depends on @xmath58 and @xmath13(li ) , so that the lithium - iso - abundance lines do not increase monotonically anymore in the @xmath13(li ) versus @xmath58 plot , as they do for g- and k - type stars ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . moreover , the similar positions of our objects and of the pleiades brown dwarfs ( basri et al . 1996 , rebolo et al . 1996 ,",
    "stauffer et al . 1998 ) in the @xmath58 versus @xmath13(li ) diagram , despite a difference of more than one order of magnitude in age between both populations , seem to rule out evolutionary factors as the cause of the apparent gap .",
    "any object with detected lithium is young or sub - stellar or both .",
    "however , for any specific age ( or age range or upper age limit ) , any object later than some specific spectral type is a bd . for the pleiades ( 125 myrs ) ,",
    "martn et al . ( 1996 ) and stauffer et al . (",
    "1998 ) found that any member later than m6.5 is a bd .",
    "one can also see from evolutionary tracks and isochrones that any object with an age of @xmath1  myrs which is cooler than the temperature corresponding to m6.5 lies below the hydrogen burning limit ( dantona & mazzitelli 1997 , burrows et al .",
    "1997 , baraffe et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "cha i members are younger than the pleiades , i.e. lie higher above the main sequence , so that they are slightly hotter at any given spectral type ( luhman et al . 1997 ) , corresponding to roughly @xmath56 sub - classes . considering also @xmath56 error in assigning the spectral classes , we should be sure that any cha i member with spectral type m7 ( i.e. @xmath77 k , luhman 1999 ) or later is sub - stellar .",
    "this is the case for cha  h@xmath0  1 , 3 , 6 , and 7 , classified as bona - fide bds in table 1 .",
    "this classification is correct , regardless of whether the objects are young : either they are younger than @xmath68 125 myrs and , hence , lie below the sub - stellar limit in the h - r diagram because of the late spectral type and the young age ( see tracks and isochrones by dantona & mazzitelli 1997 , burrows et al .",
    "1997 , baraffe et al .",
    "1998 ) ; or , alternatively , if they are not young , then they are sub - stellar because of the lithium .",
    "actualy , because most cha i tts ( see lawson et al . 1996 ) as well as cha  h@xmath0  1 to 6 ( see crn99 ) are @xmath5  myrs old , all our bona - fide and candidate bds are probably of that young age , too , i.e. much younger than @xmath78  myrs .",
    "given the spectral types of cha  h@xmath0  2 , 4 , 5 , and 8 , they are located too close to the limit for definitive discrimination .",
