    "the observational evidence of  dark energy \" with an effective negative pressure has revolutionized cosmology in the last decade . since the first evidence of dark energy in 1998  @xcite , there has been substantial observational and theoretical research aimed at understanding the true nature of this phenomenon . in recent years , many authors have started exploring the possibility that dark energy , and the observed acceleration of the expansion of the universe , could be the consequence of an incomplete theory of gravity on cosmological scales and may require modifications to einstein s theory of general relativity .",
    "a prime goal of precision cosmology in the next decades is to provide cosmological observables in a theoretical model independent way for a fair judgement of confirmation or exclusion . in other words",
    ", cosmic observation should be unplugged from our prior knowledge of underlying sciences .",
    "we study the theoretical model independent observational tool to probe the distance measures and the growth functions through the alcock ",
    "paczynski test using the anisotropy spectra of redshift distortions .",
    "the full history of cosmic expansion can be reconstructed using galaxy redshift surveys . despite the enriched nonlinear structures , the zero - th order description of our current universe is homogeneous and isotropic over sufficiently large scales  @xcite .",
    "the measured spatial distribution of galaxies is determined by the density fluctuations and the coherent peculiar velocities of galaxies . even though we expect the clustering of galaxies in real space to have no preferred direction , galaxy maps produced by estimating distances from redshifts obtained in spectroscopic surveys reveal an anisotropic galaxy distribution , known as redshift distortions .",
    "the anisotropies arise because galaxy recession velocities , from which distances are inferred , include components from both the hubble flow and peculiar velocities driven by the clustering of matter .",
    "measurements of the anisotropies allow constraints to be placed on the rate of growth of clustering and hubble flow along the line of sight  @xcite    the observed spectra in redshift space depend not only on fluctuations of density and velocity fields but also on distance measures of components perpendicular and parallel to the line of sight  @xcite . unfortunately , those are not simultaneously decomposed out of redshift distortions due to high degeneracy among observables .",
    "we can , in principle , resolve this problem if we understand the shape of the power spectrum precisely . in the context of standard cosmology",
    ", the shape of spectra is determined before the last scattering surface , and in linear theory , it evolves coherently through all scales . in this case , the shape of spectra is determined by cmb experiments , both the coherent growth functions of density and velocity and the distance measures can be determined separately in precision using the alcock ",
    "paczynski test in fourier space  @xcite .    in this paper , we present the alcock ",
    "paczynski test in the 2d configuration space where galaxy clustering is described by correlation function of @xmath5 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the separation of galaxy pair parallel and perpendicular to the line - of - sight , respectively .",
    "if we connect all tip points of bao peaks observed in @xmath5 , it forms a great circle which is called as 2d bao circle  @xcite .",
    "the shape of spectra is assumed to be determined at the last scattering surface by cmb experiments .",
    "then the 2d bao circle becomes invariant to the variation of either density or velocity growth function .",
    "however , the 2d bao circle is altered transversely to the variation of the angular diameter distance @xmath3 , and radially to the variation of the inverse of hubble rate @xmath4 .",
    "this feature explains us how to measure both transverse and radial distances simultaneously with structure formation .",
    "note that the use of the broadband shape of correlation function or power spectrum in the alcock ",
    "paczynski test has been already advocated before ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but these previous works have mainly focused on the cases with featureless initial spectrum . taking account of the bao as standard ruler , the broadband alcock ",
    "paczynski test can give a much more impact on the precision estimation of geometric distances .",
    "the impact of bao structure has been studied in many literatures . in configuration space ,",
    "the cosmological impact of bao has been mostly explored with the analysis based on the multipole expansion , or angle - averaged quantities such as clustering wedges ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) . in this paper , we are particularly interested in the 2d bao .",
    "we will discuss the mechanism to break degeneracy among distances and growth functions in further detail using the 2d bao circle .",
    "there are actually several reasons why we here consider the 2d correlation function .",
    "one obvious reason is that the 2d bao circle in @xmath6-plane is robust against various systematics , as we mentioned above .",
    "this implies that we can in principle measure the quantities , @xmath3 and @xmath7 in a purely geometrical manner without introducing a detailed model of correlation function .",
    "another reason to use @xmath5 , instead of the multipole correlation function , appears when we simultaneously measure the growth of structure with the redshift distortions . with the full 2d correlation function",
    ", one can easily distinguish between the geometric and velocity ( redshift distortions ) effects , clarifying the physical interpretation . in practice , to estimate the growth of structure , a detailed theoretical template of correlation function is necessary , however , the 2d correlation function measured in the binned space of @xmath1 and @xmath2 is useful to handle non - perturbative systematics such as the finger of god effect . just discarding bins which are contaminated by unknown systematics , robust and reliable cosmological analysis is made possible with recently proposed models of redshift distortion based on the perturbation theory calculations @xcite . while the angle - averaged statistics such as those based on the multipole expansion have appeared very popular and been frequently used in the literature , it is generally difficult to exclude the data along the line - of - sight from the angle - averaged quantities .",
    "it is thus meaningful to present the analysis of the 2d correlation function , without angular averaging , at least as a complementary method .    in this paper , based on the perturbation theory model of redshift distortions developed by  @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , we test our new broadband alcock ",
    "paczynski test as a tool to measure @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and the growth function of coherent motion .",
    "the improved model used here gives a more elaborate description of the correlation function than simple factorized formulation .",
    "the resultant formula looks very similar to the phenomelogical formula frequently used in the literature , but includes correction terms at next - to - leading orders , which assist us to achieve better fit to the simulated data of dark matter and halo distributions .",
    "the model further helps to reconstruct the density and velocity power spectra simultaneously in an unbiased way @xcite . with this improved template , in this paper , broadband alcock ",
    "paczynski test is examined with 611 boss mocking catalogues at @xmath8 .",
    "those observables are marginalized with unknown galaxy bias and non  perturbative finger of god effect .",
    "the results indicate that the precise measurements of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and the growth function of coherent motion are possible by our treatment . here",
    "are layouts of the paper . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the improved model of redshift distortions . in section 3",
    ", we introduce the mock catalogues which we use . in section 4",
    ", we explain the broadband alcock ",
    "paczynski test . in section 5 and 6 ,",
    "results and conclusion are presented .",
    "as we mentioned in sec .  1 , the redshift  space two  point correlation function of mass tracers , @xmath9 , exhibits anisotropies mainly due to the peculiar motions of galaxies  @xcite , and is described as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are again the separations between the mass tracers perpendicular and parallel to the line - of - sight direction , respectively .",
    "typically , for the separation along the line of sight ( i.e. , @xmath10 ) , the clustering in redshift space shows an elongated structure , and the resultant redshift - space correlation function is compressed or supperessed . at small separation , the suppression appears due to the nonlinear velocity dispersions of galaxies , known as finger of god effect , while the compression in correlation function becomes manifest at large separation , and the clustering pattern is squashed by the coherent infalls toward overdense regions , called kaiser effect .    in the linear regime of gravitational instability",
    ", the density and velocity fields are coherently evolved through the continuity equation .",
    "this is exactly the situation characterized by the kaiser effect , and the redshift - space correlation function @xmath5 is uniquely mapped from the real - space correlation function @xmath11 , which is computed with the linear theory of gravitational instability  @xcite .",
    "note that the commonly used streaming model  @xcite , in which the function @xmath9 is given by the convolution of real - space correlation function with velocity distribution function , also recovers the kaiser limit of redshift - space correlation in the the large - scale limit .",
    "it is , however , important to note that the resultant correlation function @xmath5 differs from the real - space correlation function for all configurations , even those perpendicular to the line of sight  ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the redshift - space power spectrum .    in our previous work",
    "@xcite , as a simple theoretical model , the linear squashing effect is combined in a multiplicative way with the gaussian damping function characterizing the finger of god ( hereafter fog ) effect . in comparing it with the measured correlation function at @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the cut  off strategy",
    "is applied to eliminate bins in non  linear regime at which the theoretical model of the redshift distortions is broken down",
    ". then the rest of bins at large separations successfully fits to the theory , and provides us coherent motions at low redshifts .",
    "recently , boss released dr9 data , and with this data set , it is now able to uncover the correlation function @xmath5 at larger @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where 2d bao structure is clearly visible .",
    "this implies that making full use of alcock  paczynski effect , we may simultaneously measure the geometric distance and the coherent motion field .",
    "however , it turned out that measurements of coherent motion from redshift distortion maps suffers from the nonlinear systematic effects . while the bao basically lies at the scales close to the linear regime , because of the nonlinear gravitational evolution , the small peak structure of bao tends to be smeared out .",
    "further , the cosmological density and velocity fields couple together , and they evolve nonlinearly .",
    "then , due to its nonlinear nature of the mapping formula between the real and redshift space , the resultant correlation function can get a noticiable nonlinear correction even at bao scales .",
    "hence , in order to unlock the full cosmological power of the bao as well as the redshift distortions , a simple factorized model of redshift - space correlation function is insufficient to describe the measured 2d bao structure , and we need a more elaborate description , for which we will discuss below .      before presenting an improved model of correlation function , let us first consider the redshift - space power spectrum . on large scales ,",
    "the observed large - scale structure is basically described by a small perturbation to the homogeneous universe . ignoring the higher - order contributions , the two - dimensional power spectrum in redshift space , @xmath14 , given as the function of wavenumber @xmath15 and directional cosine @xmath16 between line - of - sight direction and @xmath15 ,",
    "is solely characterized by the kaiser effect , and can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath17 as we mentioned , the observed redshift - space power spectra suffers significantly from nonlinear corrections even at large scales .",
    "one important effect is the gravitational evolution .",
    "further , the random motion of galaxies is known to cause the fog effect .",
    "the approximate prescription to describe these nonlinear effects was proposed by scoccimarro , and it is expressed as  @xcite ( k , ) = \\{p_(k ) + 2 ^ 2 p_(k ) + ^4 p_(k ) } g^fog(k_p ) .",
    "[ eq : s04 ] where @xmath18 is the one - dimensional velocity dispersion .",
    "nonlinear corrections due to the random motion is described by the factor @xmath19 which is given in the gaussian function , g^fog(k_p ) = \\{-(k_p)^2 } , [ eq : ggauss ] the auto- and cross - power spectra of the two fields expressed as @xmath20 , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 being either @xmath23 or @xmath24 , are the nonlinear generalization of the linear counterpart @xmath20 in eq .",
    "[ eq : kaiser ] . with the model given by eq .",
    "[ eq : s04 ] , the prediction of redshift - space correlation function @xmath25 reproduces reasonalby well the anisotropic clustering structure at scales of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "however , it fails to match the observed 2d bao peak structure .    beyond a simple model prescription , one crucial aspect of the redshift distortions",
    "may be that the linear squeezing and nonlinear smearing effects on distorted maps are not separately treated .",
    "taking account of this fact , taruya , nishimichi & saito  @xcite proposed an improved model of the redshift - space power spectrum , in which the coupling between the density and velocity fields associated with the kaiser and the fog effects is perturbatively incorporated into the power spectrum expression .",
    "the resultant expression looks similar to eq .",
    "[ eq : s04 ] , but includes nonlinear corrections consisting of higher - order polynomials  @xcite : ( k , ) & = & \\{p_(k ) + 2 ^ 2 p_(k ) + ^4 p_(k ) + & + & a(k , ) + b(k,)}g^fog . [ eq : tns10 ] here the @xmath28 and @xmath29 terms are the nonlinear corrections , and are expanded as power series of @xmath16 , including the powers up to @xmath30 for the @xmath31 term and @xmath32 for the @xmath33 term . in this paper , adopting the model given in eq .",
    "[ eq : tns10 ] , we will proceed to the cosmological analysis , and investigate the impact of these nonlinear corrections .",
    "in computing the power spectrum , we need to properly take into account the effect of nonlinear gravitational evolution not only for the @xmath31 and @xmath33 terms but also for the auto- and cross - power spectra @xmath34 .",
    "since the standard perturbation theory is known to produce ill - behaved epansion leading to the bad uv behavior , a consistent calculation of correlation function should be made with the improved perturbation theory with an appropriate uv regularization .",
    "here , we apply the resummed perturbation theory called regpt  @xcite , and following the prescription described in  @xcite , we compute the power spectra @xmath34 as well as the @xmath31 and @xmath33 terms , including the nonlinear corrections up to the two - loop order , i.e. , next - to - next - leading order .",
    "note that the regpt shceme is based on a multipoint propagator expansion , and with this scheme , any statistical quantities consisting of density and velocity fields are built up with multipoint propagators , in which nonperturbative properties of gravitational growth are wholly encapsulated  @xcite . making use of the analytic properties of the propagators ,",
    "a novel regularized treatment has been implemented  @xcite , showing that the proposed scheme can be used to give a percent - level prediction of power spectrum and correlation function at weakly nonlinear regime in both real and redshift spaces  @xcite .    with the regpt scheme ,",
    "we pre - compute the nonlinear corrections to the auto- and cross - power spectra @xmath35 in the fiducial cosmological model : [ eq : closure ] p_xy^fid(k ) = p_xy^fid(k ) - p_xy^fid , lin(k ) . adding up linear and nonlinear parts",
    ", we have p_xy(k ) = \\{p_xy^fid , lin(k)+p_xy^fid(k)}. here , the prefactor @xmath36 includes the information on the structure growth and galaxy bias , which will be later clarified in sec .",

    "although this may lead to an additional uncertainty in the parameter estimation , our previous analysis suggests that as long as we consider the weakly nonlinear scales , cosmological analysis can be made independently of the functional form of fog effect .",
    "the functions @xmath39 are given by [ eq : q ] q_0(k)&=&p_^lin(k ) + p_(k ) , + q_2(k)&=&2p_^lin(k ) + 2p_(k)+ c_2(k ) , + q_4(k)&=&p_^lin(k)+p_(k)+ c_4(k ) , + q_6(k)&=&c_6(k ) , + q_8(k)&=&c_8(k ) , where @xmath40 includes the nonlinear correction terms @xmath31 and @xmath33 , and we assume the perfect correlation between linear density and velocity fields , i.e. , @xmath41^{1/2}$ ] .",

    "the 2d bao circle itself is unchanged .    the anisotropic amplification of s  type contours is generated with the increment of @xmath98 , because the cross  correlation of density and velocity is a leading term of @xmath110  @xcite . for b",

    "when @xmath98 decreases , the bao tip points run away from the pivot point on the same circle .",
    "if the correct distances are known , the tip points of bao peaks form a invariant great circle regardless of galaxy bias and coherent motion .",
    "when @xmath3 is unknown , the 2d bao circle becomes uncertain transversely .",
    "we decrease @xmath3 by 10@xmath111 .",
