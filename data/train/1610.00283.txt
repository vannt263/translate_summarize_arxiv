    "one of the most important open question in extragalactic studies regards cosmic reionization and clarifying which sources drive this important phase transition in the early universe . while much evidence suggests that the process might be driven by galaxies ( e.g. , robertson et al .",
    "2013 , 2015 ; mitra et al .  2015 ; bouwens et al .",
    "2015 ) , others have suggested that quasars could provide the dominant contribution ( giallongo et al .",
    "2015 ; madau & haardt 2015 ; mitra et al .",
    "2016 ) .",
    "the important issues appear to be whether large numbers of faint quasars exist at high redshift ( e.g. , willott et al .  2010 ; mcgreer et al .",
    "2013 ) , whether faint galaxies show an appreciable ( @xmath95% ) escape fraction ( e.g. , siana et al .  2010 , 2015 ;",
    "vanzella et al .",
    "2012 , 2016 ; nestor et al .",
    "2013 ) , and what the total emissivity is in the rest - frame @xmath10 in faint galaxies beyond the limits of current surveys in the _ hubble _ ultra deep field ( hudf : beckwith et al .  2006 ; ellis et al .",
    "2013 ; illingworth et al .",
    "important issues for the latter question are the precise values of the faint - end slopes and the faint - end cut - off to the @xmath10 luminosity function .",
    "depending on the value of the faint - end slope and the luminosity where a cut - off in the lf occurs ( kuhlen & faucher - gigure 2012 ; bouwens et al .",
    "2012 ; robertson et al .  2013 ; bouwens 2016 ) , the total emissivity from galaxies in the @xmath10 can vary by factors of @xmath42 - 10 .    one potentially promising way to constrain the total luminosity density in the rest - frame @xmath10 is by taking advantage of the impact of gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters for magnifying individual sources .",
    "this can bring extremely faint galaxies into view such that they can be detected with current telescopes ( e.g. , bradac et al .",
    "2009 ; maizy et al .",
    "2010 ; coe et al .",
    "there has been a significant investment in this approach by _ hst _ in the form of the _ hubble _ frontier fields program ( coe et al .",

    ", it has been similarly possible ( alavi et al .",
    "2014 , 2016 ) to probe to @xmath4@xmath12 mag taking advantage of very deep wfc3/uvis observations over abell 1689 and various clusters in the hff program . based on these deep searches , the volume density of galaxies at @xmath616 mag have been estimated , with quoted faint - end slopes for @xmath13 - 3 lfs that range from @xmath14 to @xmath15 ( alavi et al .",

    "is not trivial .",
    "the entire enterprise is fraught with sources of systematic error .",
    "one of these sources of systematic error concerns the assumed size distribution of extremely faint galaxies ( bouwens et al .",
    "2016 ; grazian et al .  2011",
    "; oesch et al .",
    "small differences in the assumed half - light radii have the potential to change the inferred faint - end slopes by large factors , i.e. , @xmath17 depending on whether the mean size of extremely faint galaxies is 120 mas , 30 mas , or 7.5 mas ( e.g. , see figure 2 from bouwens et al .",
    "fortunately , we found that most of the extremely faint sources seem consistent with being almost unresolved , i.e. , with intrinsic sizes of @xmath1810 - 30 mas ( bouwens et al .",
    "2016 ; see also kawamata et al .",
    "2014 ; laporte et al .",
    "2016 ) , making this issue much more manageable in terms of its impact ; but it still remains an uncertainty . a second source of systematic error arises from errors in the magnification maps , since this can have a profound impact on the lfs derived . finally , there are issues related to subtraction of the foreground cluster light , contamination from individual sources in the clusters ( e.g. , globular clusters ) , and from other less important systematic effects that affect determinations of the volume densities in the field vs. the cluster .- band , which is useful for discriminating between @xmath0 and @xmath19 galaxies , while the hudf and candels ( grogin et al .  2011 ; koekemoer et al .",
    "2011 ) programs do feature deep integrations in this filter . the availability or not of deep observations in the @xmath20 band could impact the @xmath0 and @xmath19 samples and lf results derived from these data sets in different ways . ]    even without such considerations",
    ", it is easy to see that systematics could be a concern for lf studies from lensing clusters , simply by comparing several recent lf results from clusters with similar results based on deep field studies using the hudf .",
    "to give one recent example , alavi et al .",
    "( 2016 ) reported a faint - end slope @xmath21 of @xmath22 for the @xmath10 lf at @xmath23 based on an analysis of sources behind 3 lensing clusters , while parsa et al .",
    "( 2016 ) reported a faint - end slope of @xmath24 based on a deep @xmath23 search over the hudf .",
    "these results differ at a significance level of @xmath49@xmath8 taking at face value the quoted statistical errors .",
    "this is but one example of the large differences frequently present between lf results derived from deep field studies and those derived on the basis of lensing clusters ( see figure 1 for several other examples ) .",
    "in addition to the clear scientific importance of the faint - end slope @xmath21 for computing the total ionizing emissivity from faint galaxies , the observations also allow us to test for a possible flattening or turn - over of the @xmath10 lf at low luminosities .",
    "many cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation predict a flattening in the @xmath10 lf at @xmath25 or @xmath26 due to less efficient atomic and molecular hydrogen cooling , respectively ( muoz & loeb 2011 ; krumholz & dekel 2012 ; kuhlen et al .",

    "2016a ; gnedin 2016 ; finlator et al .  2016 ) , while other simulations predict a flattening in the range @xmath27 to @xmath25 mag due to the impact of radiative feedback ( oshea et al .  2015",

    "current observations likely provide us with some constraints in this regime . however , given the significant systematics that appear to be present in current determinations of the faint - end slope @xmath21 from lensing clusters ( vs. field results ) , it is not at all clear that current constraints on the form of the @xmath10 lf at @xmath615 mag are reliable , particularly at @xmath28 .    in the present paper ,",
    "we take the next step in our examination of the impact of systematic errors on derived lf results from lensing clusters , after our previous paper on this subject , i.e. , bouwens et al .",
    "( 2016 ) , where the emphasis was on the uncertain sizes of faint sources . here",
    "the focus will be more on the uncertainties in lf results that arise from errors in the gravitational lensing models .",
    "as we will demonstrate explicitly , the recovered lf from a straightforward analysis tends to migrate towards a faint - end slope of @xmath29 ( or slightly steeper ) , if uncertainties in the magnification factor are large .",
    "the impact of these uncertainties is to wash out features in the lf , particularly at low luminosities . given that magnification factors @xmath30 necessarily become uncertain when these factors are high , i.e. , @xmath31 and especially @xmath32 , accurately constraining the shape of the lf at extremely low luminosities and also detecting a turn - over or flattening is very challenging .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to look at the constraints we can set on the faint end of the @xmath0 @xmath10 lf with a thorough assessment of the possible systematic errors . in doing so , we will look for possible evidence for a turn - over in the lf at very low luminosities and if not present , what constraints can be placed on the luminosity of a turn - over .",
    "evidence for a turn - over will be evaluated through the introduction of a _ curvature parameter _ which we constrain through extensive markov - chain monte - carlo ( mcmc ) trials .",
    "the confidence intervals we obtain on the shape of the @xmath10 lf at faint magnitudes will provide theorists with some important constraints for comparison with models and cosmological hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "most importantly , these results provide balance to some discussion in the literature arguably making premature claims for the lf rising steeply to very low luminosities . to keep the focus of this paper on our new techniques , we restrict our analysis to just the @xmath0 lf from the first four hff clusters .",
    "the plan for this paper is as follows .",
    " 2 summarizes the data sets we use to select our @xmath0 sample and derive constraints on the @xmath0 lf . ",

    "the parametric models generally provided the best estimates of the magnification for individual sources in the hff comparison project ( meneghetti et al .",
    "2016 ) , but we emphasize that many non - parametric magnification models also performed very well .",
    "we present in figure  [ fig : sample ] the distribution of absolute magnitudes and magnification factors we estimate for sources in our @xmath0 sample .",
    "we set an arbitrary maximum magnification factor of 100 , given the lack of predictive power for magnification maps at such high values ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "this constraint affects very few sources .",
    "our selection includes sources ranging from @xmath52 mag to @xmath53 and with magnification factors ranging from 1.2 to 50 , with the bulk of the sources having absolute magnitudes of @xmath54 and magnification factors of @xmath42 .",
    "we should emphasize that the inferred luminosities and total magnitudes we report for sources are intended to provide a rather complete accounting for light in individual sources .",
    "they are based on scaled - aperture photometry following the kron ( 1980 ) method , with a correction for flux on the wings of the psf ( e.g. , see bouwens et al .",
    "however , in comparing our total magnitude measurements with the magnitude measurements from other groups ( e.g. , l16 : see  6.1.2 ) , we have found some sources being reported to have apparent magnitude measurements fainter by @xmath40.7 - 1.0 mag than what we measure for the same sources ( including the very faint @xmath55 source reported by l16 that anchors their lf at the faint end : see  6.1.2 and  6.2 ) .",

    "2016 and kawamata et al .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the low luminosities claimed by measuring magnitudes in this way exaggerate how faint the hff program probes .",
    "we discuss this further in  6.1.2 and  6.2 .",
    "we prefer our photometric scheme for accounting for the total light in faint sources .",
    "an important aspect of the present efforts to provide constraints on the @xmath0 lf will be our explicit efforts to include a full accounting of the uncertainties present in the magnification models we utilize .",
    "we begin by looking first at the general size of errors in the magnification models and second at how the errors would impact lfs derived from lensing clusters .      in making use of various gravitational lensing models to derive constraints on the prevalence of extremely faint galaxies at high redshift , it is important to obtain an estimate of how predictive the lensing models are for the true magnification factors .",
    "one way of addressing this issue is the fully end - to - end approach pursued by meneghetti et al .",
    "( 2016 ) and involves constructing highly - realistic mock data sets , analyzing the mock data sets using exactly the same approach as are used on the real observations , and then quantifying the performance of the different methods by comparing with the actual magnification maps . while each of the methods did fairly well in reproducing the magnification maps to magnification factors of @xmath410 , the best performing methods for reconstructing the magnification maps of clusters were the parametric models , with perhaps the best reconstructions achieved by the glafic models , the sharon / johnson models , and the cats models .",
    "an alternate way of addressing this issue is by comparing the public lensing models against each other .",
    "here we pursue such an approach .",
    "we treat one of the models as the truth and then to quantify the effectiveness of the other magnification models taken as a set for predicting that model s magnifiction map .",
    "we consider both the case that the true mass profile of the hff clusters is considered ( 1 ) to lie among parametric class of models built on nfw - type mass profiles and ( 2 ) to lie among the non - parametric class of models which allow for more freedom in the modeling process .",
    "we take the former models to include the glafic , cats , sharon / johnson , and zitrin - nfw models , and the latter to include the bradac [ 2009 ] , grale [ liesenborgs et al .",
    "2006 ; sebesta et al .",
    "2016 ] , and zitrin - ltm [ zitrin et al .  2012 , 2015 ] .",
    "a brief description of the general properties of the public lensing models can be found in table  [ tab : lensingmodel ] . in performing this test",
    ", we assume that the median of the magnification models provides our best means for predicting magnifications in the model we are treating as the truth . the truth model is always excluded when constructing the median magnification map for this test .",
    "the results of this exercise are presented in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : predpow ] for both the parametric and non - parametric model cases .",
    "the geometric mean of the predictive power for each of the parametric ( glafic , cats , sharon / johnson , zitrin - nfw ) and non - parametric ( grale , bradac , zitrin - ltm ) models is presented as an assessment of the predictive power of each approach for similar classes of models .",
    "the upper and lower bounds of the shaded regions give the predictive power for models corresponding to best and worst performing cluster , while the solid line in the center of the shaded region gives the median performance .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig : predpow ] shows the position - to - position scatter around the median magnification in the model treated as the truth . from this exercise ,",
    "it is clear that the magnification maps have excellent predictive power to magnification factors of @xmath410 in all cases and perhaps to even higher magnification factors assuming that the magnification profiles of hff clusters are as well behaved as in the parametric models .",
    "the scatter , however , is already very large at magnification factors of 10 .",
    "we will extend this exercise in a future work ( r.j .",
    "bouwens et al .",
    "2016 , in prep ) .",
    "the exercise we perform in this section shows similarities in philosophy to the analyses that priewe et al .",
    "( 2016 ) pursue , in comparing magnification models over the hff clusters with each other to determine the probable errors in the individual magnification maps .",
    "one prominent conclusion from that study was that differences between the magnification maps was almost always larger than the estimated errors in the magnification for a given map , pointing to large systematics in the construction of the individual maps .",
    "this provides some motivation for the tests we perform here and in future sections in this paper , and confirmation of the importance of this study .",

    "how well can we recover these lfs given uncertainties in the magnification maps ?",
    "we can evaluate this by generating a mock catalog of sources for each of the first four clusters from the hff program using one set of magnification models ( `` input '' models ) and then attempting to recover the lf using another set of magnification models ( `` recovery '' models ) . in computing the impact of lensing ,",

    "sources are binned according to luminosity using the `` recovery '' magnification model .",

    "the lowest two rows of panels in figure  [ fig : illust ] show the results using the latest magnification models by grale , cats , zitrin - ltm , and the median of the cats , sharon / johnson , and zitrin - nfw models where available .",
    "these simulation results demonstrate that the recovery process appears to work very well for input lfs with faint - end slopes of @xmath57 ( _ left panels _ in figure  [ fig : illust ] ) independent of the magnification model , with all recovered lfs showing a very similar form to the input lfs .",
    "very different results are , however , obtained in our attempts to recover input lfs with a turn - over at @xmath115 mag ( _ right panels _ in figure  [ fig : illust ] ) using magnification models that are different from the input model .",
    "for all four magnification models we consider , the recovered lfs look very similar to the lf example we just considered .",

    "what is striking is that they do not reproduce the turn - over present in the input model at @xmath11 mag .",

    "the glafic magnification model is not used when constructing the median parametric magnification model .",
    "both examples demonstrate that the faint - end slope for the recovered lfs tend to gravitate towards a value of @xmath57 .",

    ", the recovered lf closely matches the input lf ; dramatically , however , faintward of @xmath11 mag ( and even @xmath116 mag for some models ) , the recovered lfs steepen and asymptote again towards a faint - end slope of @xmath4@xmath57 ( or steeper if sources are resolved ) , even if the actual slope of the lf is much shallower ( or the lf turns over ! ) .",
    "each of these examples demonstrate that , regardless of the input lf , a faint - end slope @xmath21 of @xmath29 will be recovered whenever the magnification uncertainties are large .",
    "one can not , therefore , use the consistent recovery of a steep faint - end slope based on a large suite of lensing models to argue that the actual lf maintains a steep form to extremely low luminosities ( as was done by l16 using their figure 11 ) .",
    "the presented examples show this is not a valid argument .",
    "how then can one interpret lf results from lensing clusters when a steep lf @xmath64 is found ?",
    "as we have demonstrated , such a result could be indicative of the lfs truly being steep or simply an artifact of large magnification uncertainties .",
    "to determine which is the case , the safest course of action is to simulate all steps in the lf recovery process , to determine the impact of magnification uncertainties on the shape of the lf , and finally to interpret the recovered lfs from the observations . while we showed a few examples here",
    ", we formalize the process in the next section .",

    "the lf recovery results presented in  3 ( figure  [ fig : illust ] ) illustrate the impact that errors in the magnification maps can have on the recovered lfs .",
    "input lfs , of very different form , can be driven towards a faint - end slope @xmath21 of @xmath57 at the faint end , after accounting for the impact of magnification errors .",
    "the results from  3.2 demonstrate the importance of forward modeling the entire lf recovery process to ensure that both the results and uncertainties are reliable .",
    "we then utilize our forward - modeling approach to derive constraints on the @xmath0 lf .",
    "the basic idea behind our approach follows closely from the simulations we ran in the previous section and is illustrated in figure  [ fig : flowchart ] .",
    "we begin by treating one of the public magnification models as providing an exact representation of reality . in conjunction with an input lf ,",
    "those models are used to create a mock data set for the four hff clusters considered .",
    "the mock data set is then interpreted using other magnification models for the clusters to determine the distribution of sources vs. @xmath10 luminosity @xmath65 and also to recover the @xmath10 lf . as illustrated by the lf recovery experiments presented in  3.2 ,",
    "the recovery could be done with the models individually or by using some combination of models like the median .",
    "there are many advantages to using the present procedure to derive accurate errors on the overall shape of the @xmath10 lf .",
    "probably the most significant of these is inherent in the end - to - end nature of the present procedure and our relying significantly on forward modeling to arrive at accurate errors on the observational results . through the construction of many mock data sets using plausible magnification models and recovery using other similarly plausible models ,",
    "the proposed procedure allows us to determine the full range of allowed lfs .",
    "in addition , the advocated procedure provides us with a natural means to account for `` noise '' in the lensing model magnification maps .",
    "the presence of lensing model `` noise '' is obvious looking at the range in magnification factors across the various models ( e.g. , compare the glafic and grale critical lines in figure  [ fig : flowchart ] or see the lower panel in figure  [ fig : predpow ] ) .",
    "such noise can even be present in a median magnification model created from the combination of many individual models , as there will be regions where the high - magnification regions of the lensing maps simply overlap due to chance coincidence .",
    "analogous to considerations of low - significance sources in imaging observations , the robustness of specific magnification factors in the median map can be assessed , by considering comparisons with independent determinations of the same map . through the treatment of one of the public magnification models as the truth",
    ", the present forward - modeling approach effectively formalizes such a technique to determine the robustness of specific features in the magnification maps .",
    "the advantage of the current procedure is that this robustness can be determined using the full magnification maps available for each cluster ( and not just at a limited number of positions where candidate high - magnification @xmath31 sources happen to be found in the real observations ) , while also allowing us to derive more reliable likelihood distributions ( with realistic errors ) .",
    "another advantage of our forward modeling procedure is that it explicitly incorporates source selection .",
    "this is important , since the selection efficiency @xmath66 could depend on the magnification factor @xmath30 in the sense that the most magnified sources would also be the most incomplete , as is likely the case for the brightest and most extended objects , due to the impact of lensing shear on source detection ( oesch et al .",
    "if the same situation applied to the faintest sources in the hffs ( and one did not utilize a procedure that included forward modeling or an explicit correction ) , the recovered lfs would be biased .",
    "this is due to the fact that the actual surface density of the sources on the sky is @xmath67 , but it is assumed to be proportional to @xmath68 and @xmath69 at high magnifications @xmath31 ( figure  [ fig : predpow ] ) .",
    "the recovered lf would therefore be higher by the factor @xmath70 .",
    "we would expect such an issue to affect recovered lfs , in all cases where sources have non - zero size ( since the selection efficiency would then depend on the magnification factor ) .",
    "for example , if the completeness of sources shows an inverse correlation with the magnification factor as oesch et al .",
    "( 2015 ) find , i.e. , @xmath71 ( e.g. , as in their figure 3 ) , a direct approach would recover a faint - end slope that is @xmath72 steeper than in reality ( figure  [ fig : illustsize ] from appendix b ) , at very low luminosities where @xmath31 ( where @xmath18@xmath73@xmath9 is typically less than @xmath18@xmath74@xmath9 ) .    remarkably , there is no evidence that this issue is even considered in many recently derived lfs , which is worrisome given the size assumptions which were made .",
    "this is most problematic for analyses pushing to very low luminosities , i.e. , @xmath75 mag , while quoting tiny statistical uncertainties ( e.g. , l16 who quote statistical uncertainties on @xmath21 of @xmath70.04 vs. this bias which is @xmath48@xmath3 larger ) .",
    "we perform our forward modeling simulations at the catalog level , to ensure that the time requirements on these simulations are manageable .",
    "this involves the construction of catalogs of sources with precise positions and apparent magnitudes .",
    "both in the construction of the mock catalogs and in recovering the lf from these catalogs , the selection efficiency @xmath66 must be accounted for , which is in general a function of the apparent magnitude @xmath76 and magnification factor @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath77 . for the lowest luminosity @xmath78 - 8 galaxies",
    ", there is little evidence to suggest that these sources show significant spatial extension ( bouwens et al .",
    "2016 ) , which implies that we can credibly treat their selection efficiencies as just a function of the apparent magnitudes , i.e. , @xmath79 .",
    "we describe our procedure for estimating @xmath79 in this case in appendix a.    in putting together the mock suite of observations for each lf parameter set we are considering , i.e. , @xmath80 , @xmath21 , and a third parameter @xmath81 to be introduced in the next section , @xmath42@xmath310@xmath82 sources are inserted at random positions ( uniformly in the source plane ) across the 4 hff cluster fields we are using ( figure  [ fig : flowchart ] ) . in constructing the mock set of observations , we include sources in the catalogs in proportion to their estimated selection efficiencies @xmath77 from appendix a. all sources in the input catalogs",
    "are assumed to have the same input redshift @xmath58 . during the recovery process",
    ", sources are placed into individual bins in @xmath10 luminosity using a `` recovery '' magnification model , which we take to be the median of the parametric magnification models . during the recovery process",
    ", the redshift is taken to have the same mean value as assumed in constructing the mock catalogs , i.e. , @xmath83 , but with a @xmath84 uncertainty of 0.3 .",
    "this is to account for the impact of uncertainties in the estimated redshifts of individual sources on the recovered lfs .",
    "we use the results of the simulations we run for each parameter set ( each with @xmath42@xmath310@xmath82 sources ) to establish the expectation values for the number of sources per luminosity bin ( in the same 0.5-mag intervals used in the previous section ) .",
    "we then compute the likelihood of a given parameterization of the lf by comparing the observed number of galaxies per bin in luminosity ( considering all 4 clusters at the same time ) with the expected numbers assuming a poissonian distribution , as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the expected number of sources in a given bin in intrinsic @xmath10 luminosity .",
    "the observed number of sources in a given bin in @xmath10 luminosity @xmath87 is computed from the median parametric magnification maps , as done in  2 ( figure  [ fig : sample ] ) . a flow chart showing one example of our forward - modeling approach",
    "is provided in figure  [ fig : flowchart ] .",
    "use of a parametric form to the lf is particularly useful for examining the overall lf constraints on the shape of the @xmath10 lf in lensed fields , due to uncertainties that exist on the magnification factors , and hence luminosities , of individual sources used in the construction of the lf .",
    "this makes it difficult to place sources in specific bins of the @xmath10 lf ( resulting in each bin showing a larger error ) .    for the parametric modeling",
    "we do of the lf , we start with a general schechter form for the lf : @xmath88 however , we modify the basic form of the schechter function by multiplying the general schechter form by the following expression faintward of @xmath89 mag : @xmath90 positive values of @xmath81 result in the lf turning over faintward of @xmath89 mag , while negative values of @xmath81 result in the lf becoming steeper faintward of @xmath89 mag . an illustration of this parameterization is provided in figure  [ fig : param ] .",
    "our use of @xmath89 mag allows us to test for possible curvature in the shape of the lf at @xmath616 mag , as predicted by some models ( e.g. , kuhlen et al .",

    "ocvirk et al .",
    "@xmath89 mag is also just faintward of luminosities probed in field studies ( i.e. , @xmath91 mag : bouwens et al .",
    "finally , since @xmath92 mag corresponds to the luminosity of @xmath31 faint sources in the hffs , our fitting for a curvature parameter @xmath81 allows us to investigate how well the shape of the lf can be recovered in the regime where the magnification factors are large .    with this parameterization ,",
    "the turn - over luminosity @xmath93 can be easily shown to be @xmath94 assuming that @xmath95 .",

    "l16 claimed evidence against a turn - over in the @xmath0 lf 3.1 mag fainter than what we do ( taking the glafic - vs .- median magnification map uncertainties to be typical ) , despite their examining just half the present data set and with a smaller @xmath0 sample .",
    "how could they claim stronger constraints ?",
    "remarkably , we believe the reason lies not in the faintest source they report , but instead in the very high volume densities they estimate for the @xmath10 lf in the range @xmath141 to @xmath11 ( which lie in significant excess of our own determinations , by factors of @xmath160 - 4 : see figure  [ fig : lf6comp ] ) .    when compared to brighter points in the lf , the volume density of sources they report over the luminosity range @xmath141 to @xmath11 is sufficiently high ( and possessing such small error bars ) as to suggest a lf form which steepens further at lower luminosities , i.e. , @xmath179 , rather than one which retains a fixed faint - end slope and then flattens towards lower luminosities , i.e. , @xmath95 ( using our formalism ) . given the inclusion of these points , with a `` concave up '' feature at @xmath180 mag ( _ indicated in figure  [ fig : lf6comp ] with the short dotted line feature _ ) , in their lf fits , we suspect it would be very difficult indeed for l16 to find evidence for a turn - over at intermediate luminosities ( since all the `` evidence '' would seem to point in the opposite direction ) . given the statistical weight of this feature at @xmath180 to @xmath11 mag and the points brighter than @xmath141 mag , l16 would find that they needed to probe very faint indeed to find a luminosity where a turn - over was allowed .",
    "even if we ignore such issues , l16 present a second piece of evidence to argue against a possible turn - over at @xmath26 mag and this involves a @xmath0 candidate reported to be at @xmath181 mag and on whose basis they estimate a volume density of @xmath46 galaxies per mpc@xmath182 at @xmath183 mag .",
    "if robust , this candidate could also argue against a turn - over in the lf at higher luminosities .",
    "this @xmath0 candidate from l16 is also detected in our catalogs .",
    "however , it fails to meet our selection criteria , due to the fact that the integrated likelihood of the candidate lying at @xmath47 is @xmath450% and therefore we do not include it in our @xmath0 sample .",
    "however , the source may still correspond to a @xmath0 galaxy and therefore it is worthwhile to consider .",
    "on the basis of our own photometry , we estimate the source to have a total magnitude of 28.9 mag . using the magnification factor of 60.6@xmath184 l16 estimate for the source based on current magnification models which are publicly available and a redshift of @xmath0",

    "it is not surprising that we recover lower volume densities than recovered by l16 , given our use of smaller sizes for the faint @xmath92 mag population as now appears to be appropriate ( bouwens et al .",

    "we also checked that the inclusion of this source only had a moderate impact on the allowed luminosity of a turn - over .",

    "here we describe our procedure for estimating the effective selection volumes for faint galaxies behind the hff clusters we examine .",
    "our baseline treatment is to model faint galaxies as point sources in estimating their selection volumes .",
    "this choice is motivated by our demonstration in bouwens et al .",
    "( 2016 ) that the faintest @xmath13 - 8 galaxies behind the hff clusters appeared consistent with having essentially point - source spatial profiles , with no discernible extension along the expected shear axes .",
    "also , no discernible dependence was found for the measured surface densities as a function of the predicted shear in the high - magnification regions . nonetheless , as such small sizes for galaxies are unexpected ( e.g. , liu et al .",
    "2016b ; kratsov 2013 ) , we also consider the impact of larger sizes ( and a larger incompleteness ) on the lf results throughout the paper .    as point sources ,",
    "the only quantity of importance from the lensing model is the magnification factor ; the form of the deflection ( or shear ) map has no impact on the results .",
    "this simplifies the selection volume simulations enormously , since it means we can estimate the selection volumes for extremely faint sources in the presence of lensing in exactly the same way we would estimate the selection volumes in the absence of lensing",
    ". the only quantity of importance in estimating the selection volumes is the apparent magnitudes of the sources .",
    "bouwens et al .",
    "( 2016 ) discuss this in their  6.3 .",
    "we adopt a median value of @xmath218 for the @xmath10-continuum slope for galaxies in our simulations to match that found in the observations ( e.g. , bouwens et al .",
    "2014 : see also wilkins et al .",
    "2011 ; bouwens et al .",
    "2012 ; finkelstein et al .  2012 ; dunlop et al .  2013",
    "; rogers et al .  2014 ; duncan & conselice 2015 ) .    adopting these assumptions for the color of the sources and a point - source assumption for the size",
    ", we create artificial images for each source over the full suite of passbands and insert these images into the real observations .",
    "we then do object detection and photometry using the same procedure as we use in constructing our catalogs (  3 ) and then apply our selection criteria . in this way",
    ", we derive the completeness for sources in different regimes .",
    "selection volumes are computed by multiplying the cosmological volume element by the estimated completeness and integrating over redshift .",
    "the impact of magnification errors on the derived lf can also depend on source size , as discussed in  4.1 .",
    "this can occur as a result of the fact that higher magnification sources are more generally more difficult to detect , if they are spatially extended , than if their magnification is lower .",
    "in other words , the selection efficiency @xmath66 is a function of the magnification factor @xmath30 .",
    "the issue is that while the actual surface density of sources in our catalogs is proportional to @xmath67 , the selection volumes we estimate for these sources is @xmath68 .",
    "this results in the recovered volume density for these sources being higher than the true surface density by the factor @xmath18@xmath67@xmath9@xmath219@xmath18@xmath68@xmath9 .",
    "@xmath4 @xmath18@xmath74@xmath9 , no bias is present in the recovery volume density of sources .",
    "however , when @xmath18@xmath73@xmath9 is less than @xmath18@xmath74@xmath9 , as is often the case at higher magnifications @xmath31 ( figure  [ fig : predpow ] ) , the recovered surface density of sources can be significantly higher than reality .",
    "for example , assuming that @xmath220 as in figure 3 of oesch et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , the lf asymptotes towards a faint - end slope of @xmath168 .    to illustrate the impact of source size and different assumptions about @xmath221 , we consider two different cases : the first involving point sources where @xmath66 is independent of @xmath30 and the second involving extended sources where @xmath221 is proportional to @xmath222 .",
    "similar to the simulations run in  3.2 , we use the glafic model to construct mock catalogs and then recover the lf using either the grale model ( _ red line _ ) or the median parametric magnification model ( _ blue line _ ) . in the two cases ,",
    "we incorporate the different dependencies of @xmath66 on the magnification factor @xmath30 for both the catalog construction and recovery of the lf .",
    "the input lf for the simulations has a faint - end slope of @xmath63 , with no turn - over at the faint end .",
    "the results are presented in figure  [ fig : illustsize ] , and the differences between the two size cases are immediately obvious . in the point source case , the faint - end slope asymptotes to @xmath57 . however , in the case of extended sources , the faint - end slope instead asymptotes to @xmath168 . in either case , the lfs asymptotically approach these slopes faintward of @xmath89 mag assuming the grale model and faintward of @xmath11 assuming the median parametric magnification model .",
    "this example should reinforce how difficult it is to obtain accurate constraints on the shape of the lf at @xmath75 mag and thus to detect the existence of a flattening or turn - over in the lf .",
    "not only do the results depend on the magnification level to which magnification maps retain their predictive power ( e.g. , see figure  [ fig : predpow ] ) , but the results also depend significantly ( i.e. , @xmath72 ) on the size distribution for faint sources .    we emphasize that the impact this has on the lf shape is distinct from the effect already discussed in the companion study to the present one ( bouwens et al .",
    "2016 ) , where the faint - end slope @xmath21 of the lf could be biased if the sizes and hence selection volumes were improperly estimated .",
    "this bias explicitly arises _ because of errors in the magnification map _ and due to mismatches between @xmath18@xmath67@xmath9 and @xmath18@xmath68@xmath9 .    if faint sources are slightly resolved ( after magnification )  as assumed in many recent studies of faint galaxies  this bias has the potential to be quite significant at absolute magnitudes @xmath65 of @xmath75 mag where @xmath223 .",
    "amazingly , however , previous work appear to have neither recognized the importance of such a bias , not made use of procedures that would allow for its correction , even though given the size assumptions in e.g. l16 , this bias would constitute an important effect .",
    "errors in the magnification maps can have a substantial impact on the shape of the @xmath0 lf faintward of @xmath11 mag .",
    "we already illustrated this in  3.2 of this paper using a lf which turned over at @xmath11 mag ( figure  [ fig : illust ] ) .",
    "here we show the impact of these magnification errors using a @xmath0 lf with a faint - end slope @xmath63 , which we intentionally take to be substantially shallower than @xmath57 ( the direction in which magnification errors drive the apparent faint - end slope ) .",
    "again , we use a forward modeling procedure where we create the mock catalogs using the glafic magnification maps and then alternatively recover the lfs with the cats , grale , zitrin - ltm , and median parametric magnification maps .    the result is shown in figure  [ fig : illust15 ] , and excellent recovery of the lf is observed brightward of @xmath224 mag for all magnification maps .",
    "the best performance is achieved using the median magnification map ; however , we note that faintward of @xmath11 mag , the recovered lf still diverges from the input lf , rapidly transitioning faintward of @xmath11 to a faint - end slope of @xmath57 .",
    "in utilizing the data from the hff clusters to map out the faint - end of the uv lf and derive faint - end slope results , it is valuable to perform this exercise using only the hff samples to preserve the independence of the faint - end slope determinations from those derived from the field ( i.e. , the hudf ) . by doing so , one can conduct fair comparisons between faint - end slope results @xmath21 derived using lensing clusters and from the field to test for consistency .    towards this end",
    ", we have taken the binned lf results from l16 on the hff clusters and fit the results to a power law to estimate a faint - end slope @xmath21 .",
    "the results are presented in figure  [ fig : livfit ] as the solid lines and give slopes of @xmath225 , @xmath226 , and @xmath227 at @xmath0 , @xmath19 , and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "interestingly , these results are mostly steeper than the faint - end slopes inferred from field searches at the relevant redshifts .",
    "part of this difference could be due to the modest bias towards steeper slopes as a result of the large sizes l16 use in estimating the selection volumes ( bouwens et al .",
    "2016 : see their figure 2 ) .",
    "we can obtain even stronger constraints on the faint - end slope @xmath21 results from the hff clusters by having at least one point on the bright end of the lf from field searches to use as an anchor .",
    "there is not much search volume available behind clusters to constrain this part of the lf , and so including this information is useful .",
    "we therefore refit the @xmath0 , @xmath19 , and @xmath45 lf results on the hff clusters from l16 , anchoring the fit results to the field lf results from the same group , i.e. , finkelstein et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , at @xmath228 mag using their best - fit schechter function .",
    "we chose @xmath228 mag somewhat arbitrarily to be close enough to the knee of the lf , i.e. , @xmath229 mag , while not being so bright as to be affected by uncertainties in the assumed characteristic luminosity or form of the bright end of the lf ( schechter vs. power - law : i.e. , bowler et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "the fits are presented in figure  [ fig : livfit ] as the dotted lines .",
    "the faint - end slopes in this case are @xmath230 , @xmath231 , and @xmath232 for the @xmath0 , @xmath19 , and @xmath45 lfs , respectively .",
    "these values are consistent with the faint - end slope @xmath21 results we derive from the hff results from l16 without a bright anchor point ."
