    "the possible existence of molecular anions ( negatively charged ions ) in the interstellar medium was discussed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated that the large electron affinity of carbon - chain molecules and hydrocarbon radicals would lead to efficient radiative electron attachment rate coefficients for species with more than 4 - 5 atoms resulting in anion - to - neutral ratios on the order of a few percent .",
    "confirmation of this hypothesis was achieved following the measurement of the rotational spectrum of the molecular anion , c@xmath2h@xmath3 , in the laboratory by @xcite .",
    "this measurement allowed the verification , from existing astronomical spectra @xcite , of the presence of c@xmath2h@xmath3 in the envelope of the carbon rich evolved star , irc+10216 , at an abundance 1%-5% that of the neutral molecule . a successful astronomical search for c@xmath2h@xmath3 in tmc-1(cp ) by @xcite determined an anion - to - neutral ratio of @xmath4 2.5% in this source .",
    "the rotational spectra of c@xmath5h@xmath3 , c@xmath6h@xmath3 , and c@xmath7n@xmath3 have since been measured in the laboratory @xcite with subsequent detections of c@xmath5h@xmath3 @xcite , c@xmath6h@xmath3 @xcite , and c@xmath7n@xmath3 @xcite in the envelope of irc+10216 and c@xmath6h@xmath3 in tmc-1 @xcite .",
    "prompted by the observation of various carbon - chain molecules with large abundances in l1527 , a class o / i protostar , by @xcite , c@xmath2h@xmath3 was searched for and confirmed to be present in this source @xcite followed closely by the detection of c@xmath5h@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "a survey of galactic molecular sources by @xcite detected c@xmath2h@xmath3 in two futher sources , the pre - stellar cloud , l1544 , and the protostellar object , l1521f , suggestive of the ubiquitousness of molecular anions and c@xmath2h@xmath3 in particular .",
    "@xcite have attributed a series of rotational lines observed in the envelope of irc+10216 to a new molecular anion , c@xmath8n@xmath3 , although confirmation of this detection awaits successful measurement of the rotational spectrum of the molecule in the laboratory .    following the identification of c@xmath2h@xmath3 in the envelope of irc+10216 and the detection in tmc-1 ,",
    "@xcite expanded the current release of the umist database for astrochemistry @xcite and the existing chemical network for the envelope of irc+10216 @xcite to include the molecular anions , c@xmath0@xmath9 with n = 5 - 10 and c@xmath0h@xmath3 with n = 4 - 10 , using calculated rate coefficients for radiative electron attachment .",
    "their results were limited to calculated anionic and precursor neutral column densities . for tmc-1 ( cp ) , they found that the calculated ` early time ' c@xmath2h@xmath3 column density of @xmath10 @xmath11 was very close to that measured by @xcite , @xmath12 @xmath11 .",
    "the calculated anion - to - neutral ratio of 5.2% was also in good agreement with the observed value of 2.5% .",
    "more recently , @xcite investigated the chemistry of the protostellar object , l1527 , concentrating on the formation and depletion of molecular anions . @xcite",
    "considered the effects of negatively charged pahs ( polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ) on dense cloud chemistry and found that pah@xmath3 can replace electrons as the dominant negative charge carrier , an effect which depends strongly on the size of the pahs considered .",
    "the presence of molecular anions at significant abundances in the sources discussed above suggests that anions play a more significant role in the chemistry of astrophysical environments than previously believed . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the effects that the inclusion of molecular anion chemistry has on the chemistry of dark clouds by running simple pseudo - time - dependent models using the most recent release of the umist database for astrochemistry @xcite , henceforth referred to as ` rate06 ' , and the latest osu ( ohio state university ) network , osu.03.2008 ( see http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/@xmath4eric/ ) .",
    "we compare our calculated fractional abundances for models both excluding and including anions with fractional abundances observed towards the cyanopolyyne ( cp ) peak of the dark cloud core , tmc-1 , to determine the role that these species play in the gas - phase chemistry of dark clouds .    in section [ chemmod ]",
    ", we describe our anionic chemistry and the initial chemical abundances and physical conditions adopted for our standard model .",
    "section [ res ] contains detailed results obtained with and without anions for both networks , discusses the effects of anions on the chemistry of selected classes of neutral species and compares our results with observations towards the molecular - rich region , tmc-1 ( cp ) .",
    "section [ crich ] shows how our results are affected by the use of carbon - rich elemental abundances .",
    "finally , in section [ disc ] we summarize our main findings .",
    "we have expanded both rate06 and the osu network to include the molecular anions c@xmath0@xmath3 ( n = 3 - 10 ) , c@xmath0h@xmath3 ( n = 4 - 10 ) , and c@xmath0n@xmath3 ( n = 3 , 5 ) , building upon the previous work by @xcite by increasing the number of molecular anions studied and expanding the reaction set for each anion to incorporate new reaction channels and rate coefficients from recently published experimental work @xcite .",
    "we use the dipole - enhanced version of rate06 , which includes an enhancement of ion - neutral rate coefficients at low temperatures for reactions where the neutral has a large , permanent dipole moment ( @xmath13 0.9 debye ) .",
    "the resulting rate coefficients have a t@xmath14 dependence at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "a similar but not identical enhancement for the rate coefficients of ion - dipolar reactions is used in the osu network @xcite .",
    "the anions are formed primarily via radiative electron attachment , @xmath15 with updated attachment rate coefficients from recent theoretical calculations by @xcite .",
    "the hydrocarbon anions are destroyed through reactions with h , c , o , n , by photo - detachment , and by mutual neutralization with abundant cations such as c@xmath16 .",
    "the destruction channels are listed in reactions ( [ hreact ] ) to ( [ mutneut ] ) with m = 0 or 1 : @xmath17 we have taken the rate coefficients for reaction ( [ hreact ] ) from @xcite and for reactions ( [ creact ] ) , ( [ oreact ] ) , and ( [ nreact ] ) from @xcite for the species for which they were measured . in the absence of laboratory data , we have used estimated rate coefficients based on the experimental measurements .",
    "the rate coefficients and reaction channels for reaction ( [ nreact ] ) are particularly uncertain because @xcite were unable to detect associative detachment as a reaction channel , a potentially important synthetic route to the hc@xmath0n molecules .",
    "we discuss the implications of these uncertainties in  [ hcnn ] .",
    "the photo - detachment rate coefficients ( reaction [ [ photreact ] ] ) adopted are those listed in table 1 of @xcite , although in our model , this is an unimportant destruction mechanism as tmc-1 is well - shielded from external sources of uv radiation .",
    "the mutual neutralization reactions ( reaction [ [ mutneut ] ] ) each have a rate coefficient @xmath18 @xmath19 s@xmath20 as included by @xcite in their chemical model of l1527 .",
    "we have assumed in all instances where appropriate that the products are obtained by a simple electron transfer .",
    "the c@xmath7n@xmath3 chemistry we have added includes that listed in table 1 of @xcite plus formation routes via the molecular anions , c@xmath0@xmath3 and c@xmath0h@xmath3 ( eq . [ [ nreact ] ] ) , as observed in the experimental results of @xcite .",
    "we have included c@xmath8n@xmath3 using the same destruction reactions and rate coefficients as for c@xmath7n@xmath3 with a formation reaction rate coefficient ( reaction [ [ e - attach ] ] ) calculated by e. herbst ( private communication ) using the method of @xcite , to be @xmath21 @xmath19 s@xmath20 . due to the inclusion of c@xmath22@xmath3 and c@xmath22h@xmath3",
    ", we extrapolated both networks to include further hydrocarbon species containing 10 carbon atoms hence restricting the hydrocarbon chemistry to molecules with 11 carbon atoms or less .",
    "we model the gas - phase chemistry of a dark cloud core by treating the source as an homogeneous , isotropic cloud with the constant physical parameters , n(h@xmath1 ) = 10@xmath23 @xmath24 , t = 10 k , and a@xmath25 = 10 mag , using a cosmic - ray ionisation rate of @xmath26 s@xmath20 , and performing pseudo - time - dependent calculations , in which the chemistry evolves from initial abundances that are atomic except for molecular hydrogen , which is produced efficiently at an earlier stage .",
    "we employ the commonly used oxygen - rich low - metal elemental abundances , as listed in table [ table1 ] and suggested originally by @xcite . because pseudo - time - dependent gas - phase models of dark clouds are relatively predictive compared with more complex physical models , using such a simplified model helps us to accurately identify particular reactions or , more commonly , systems of reactions that are important and require further study .    any comparison between our modelled results and observations in tmc-1 ( cp ) could , of course , be compromised by our use of a simplified model for a dark cloud .",
    "we would expect that employing a more detailed physical model could lead to different results from those presented here ; however , such models are certainly not unique and therefore bring their own limitations .",
    "for example , recent work by @xcite , in which a chemical dynamical - model following both the gas - phase and surface chemistry as a dense cloud forms via a shock , finds little difference in the gas - phase abundances of large molecules although the time - scales for formation are certainly different . chemical factors , such as our neglect of accretion of gas - phase species onto dust grains , will also affect gas - phase abundances , although the timescales we are discussing here , @xmath27 yr , are only just at the stage where accretion becomes important for the conditions we have adopted .",
    "table  [ table2 ] shows our calculated abundances using both networks for an assortment of molecules at the times of best agreement ( typically @xmath28 yr ) for tmc-1 ( cp ) along with the observed values or upper limits .",
    "model results are shown for calculations with and without anions . as can be seen",
    ", there is little difference between the results obtained with rate06 and with the osu network .",
    "we first discuss the anions and then consider families of neutral species strongly affected by the inclusion of anions . throughout this section",
    ", we display the results from the models using rate06 only because the results from the models using the osu network are similar .",
    "the calculated fractional abundances of the molecular anions , c@xmath29h@xmath3 for n = 4 , 6 , 8 , and 10 , c@xmath29@xmath3 for n = 4 , 6 , 8 , and 10 , and c@xmath29n@xmath3 for n = 3 and 5 , along with the neutral precursor or each anion , are plotted as a function of time in figures  [ figure1 ]  ( a ) , [ figure1 ]  ( b ) and [ figure1 ]  ( c ) , respectively . because the main route of formation of the anions at all times is radiative electron attachment ,",
    "the abundances of the anions follow that of their neutral precursors with both generally inversely proportional to molecular size .",
    "an exception is the abundance of c@xmath5h@xmath3 , which at @xmath30 yr is comparable to that of c@xmath2h@xmath3 because of the slow radiative electron attachment rate coefficient calculated for c@xmath5h @xcite .",
    "the larger abundance of c@xmath8n@xmath3 compared with c@xmath7n@xmath3 at all times , despite the smaller abundance of c@xmath8n compared with c@xmath7n , is due to the much larger electron attachment rate coefficient calculated for c@xmath8n ( @xmath31 @xmath32 s@xmath20 compared with @xmath33 @xmath32 s@xmath20 ) . although the reaction rate coefficient for the formation of c@xmath7n@xmath3 via dissociative attachment of hnc@xmath7 is two orders of magnitude larger than that of the radiative electron attachment ( see table 1 of @xcite ) the abundance of hnc@xmath7 only reaches @xmath4 0.01 that of c@xmath7n after @xmath27 yr when dissociative attachment becomes comparable with radiative attachment .",
    "the abundances of both the anions and neutrals peak around @xmath34 yr and the destruction of the anions is dominated by reactions with h , c , o and c@xmath16 ( reactions [ [ hreact ] ] , [ [ creact ] ] , [ [ oreact ] ] , and [ [ mutneut ] ] , respectively ) .    in the absence of anions , the main destruction channels for c@xmath0h are via reactions with c , o , and n : @xmath35 the inclusion of anions introduces radiative electron attachment ( reaction [ [ e - attach ] ] ) as a destruction mechanism and it is this channel that dominates the destruction of the c@xmath0h molecules at all times , excepting c@xmath5h for which the destruction via the reaction with o is comparable .",
    "anionic chemistry also introduces new formation routes for the c@xmath0h radicals .",
    "ordinarily , these radicals are formed primarily via dissociative electron attachment to hydrocarbon cations as well as via carbon insertion reactions ( in reaction [ [ elecattach ] ] m = 2 or 3 ) : @xmath36 new formation routes become important past @xmath37 yr when appreciable abundances of molecular anions have built up and c@xmath0h is formed via associative electron detachment from carbon - chain anion and hydrocarbon anion precursors ( see reactions [ [ hreact ] ] and [ [ creact ] ] ) : @xmath38    radiative electron attachment of the bare carbon - chain neutrals , c@xmath0 , as a destruction mechanism , only dominates prior to @xmath39 yr , at which point reactions with o become comparable to this channel . as with the hydrocarbon radicals ,",
    "the inclusion of bare carbon - chain anions opens up an additional formation route to the bare carbon - chain neutrals via associative electron detachment ( reaction [ [ creact ] ] ) : @xmath40    as can be seen in table  [ table2 ] , the abundances for c@xmath2h@xmath3 and c@xmath6h@xmath3 are over - predicted at the time of best overall agreement by around an order of magnitude , with the abundance for c@xmath5h@xmath3 around 50 times greater than the estimated upper limit by @xcite .",
    "there is a sharp decline in the predicted c@xmath41h@xmath9 abundances at somewhat later times , however , as can be seen in figure  [ figure1 ]  ( a ) .",
    "the abundance of c@xmath5h@xmath3 only falls below the upper limit estimated by @xcite after @xmath4 10@xmath42 yr indicating that our electron attachment rate for c@xmath5h is too large or that we are neglecting further destruction mechanisms for this species .",
    "in contrast to the anions already discussed , the predicted abundance of c@xmath43n@xmath3 at the time of best overall agreement is in accordance with the upper limit determined by @xcite .",
    "the calculated anion - to - neutral ratio , c@xmath0h@xmath9/c@xmath0h for n = 4 , 6 , 8 , and 10 is plotted as a function of time in figure  [ figure2 ] , along with the observed ratios for c@xmath2h and c@xmath6h .",
    "the calculated ratio for all species reaches a minimum around 10@xmath44 yr , the same time that the peak in individual fractional abundances is reached .",
    "the model results for rate06 yield 5.2% for the c@xmath2h ratio and 3.9% for the c@xmath6h ratio .",
    "these compare with the observed values for c@xmath2h and c@xmath6h of 1.6% and 4.6% , respectively .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to investigate the effects that the inclusion of anions has on the abundances and evolutionary behavior of other species in established chemical models .",
    "we have identified several families of species that are affected ; these include the neutral precursors of the anions , c@xmath0 , c@xmath0h , and c@xmath0n as well as the families of molecules c@xmath0h@xmath1 and hc@xmath0n . the sensitivity of species in these families to the inclusion of anions can be seen in table [ table2 ] for both networks .      figure  [ figure3 ]  ( a ) displays the fractional abundances of the neutral c@xmath0 molecules for n = 4 , 6 , 8 , and 10 as a function of time for the models with and without anions .",
    "it is immediately apparent that the abundances of c@xmath2 , c@xmath6 , and c@xmath22 are enhanced at all times .",
    "the relative enhancement is more significant with increasing molecular size with little change in the abundance of c@xmath5 , in contrast to that of c@xmath22 , which increases by around 2 orders of magnitude in the presence of anions ( see table [ table2 ] ) . as discussed previously in ",
    "[ anions ] , introducing anions to the chemistry includes a new formation route via associative electron detachment ( reaction [ [ assdetach3 ] ] ) whereby larger neutral carbon - chains can build up from smaller anionic precursors through repeated insertion of a carbon atom .",
    "figure  [ figure3 ]  ( b ) shows the fractional abundances of the c@xmath0h molecules for the models with and without anions . as in figure  [ figure3 ]  ( a ) for c@xmath0",
    ", there is an obvious enhancement of the larger hydrocarbon radicals , c@xmath2h , c@xmath6h , and c@xmath22h , at all times prior to @xmath46 yr with the enhancement increasing with molecular size .",
    "the addition of anions introduces two new formation mechanisms via associative detachment from bare carbon - chain anions ( reaction [ [ assdetach1 ] ] ) and hydrocarbon anions ( reaction [ [ assdetach2 ] ] ) , again introducing a new route to the formation of larger hydrocarbon radicals from smaller ones . at the time of overall best agreement , as seen in table [ table2 ] , the inclusion of anions enhances the abundance of c@xmath2h from a value which is @xmath47 3 times smaller than observed to one @xmath47 3 times larger than observed , while the abundance of c@xmath6h is enhanced from a value @xmath47 4 times smaller to one @xmath47 14 times larger than observed .",
    "there is no enhancement of the c@xmath5h abundance , which remains a factor of @xmath47 5 below the observed value . as in the case for the hydrocarbon anions , the abundances of both c@xmath2h and c@xmath6h reach their best agreement with observation at slightly later times , while that of c@xmath5h diminishes further .",
    "the fractional abundances of the c@xmath0n radicals , with n = 3 , 5 , 7 , and 9 , are plotted in figure  [ figure3 ]  ( c ) , as a function of time .",
    "the abundances of all of these species are enhanced in the model with anions , compared with the results for the model without anions , prior to @xmath48 yr .",
    "as with the carbon chains and hydrocarbons , the biggest relative enhancement is seen in the larger species , c@xmath49n and c@xmath50n , with the peak fractional abundance of c@xmath50n increasing by around 2 orders of magnitude from @xmath51 to @xmath52 . when anions are not included in the model , the main routes to the formation of c@xmath0n for n = 5 , 7 , and 9 are @xmath53 with destruction via reactions with o and n atoms .",
    "reaction ( [ cnnform1 ] ) dominates the formation up to @xmath27 yr after which reaction ( [ cnnform3 ] ) is comparable to or dominates over reaction ( [ cnnform1 ] ) . for c@xmath7n , reaction ( [ cnnform3 ] ) is the main route of formation at all times .",
    "the inclusion of anions introduces a new formation route via the bare carbon chain anions , c@xmath0@xmath3 : @xmath54 and it is this route that dominates the formation for n = 5 , 7 , and 9 up to @xmath27 yr after which reactions ( [ cnnform1 ] ) and ( [ cnnform3 ] ) take over . as in the case without anions , the main formation route for c@xmath7n is through reaction ( [ cnnform3 ] ) . as the abundances of the c@xmath0h radicals",
    "are enhanced with the inclusion of anions this also increases the influence of reaction ( [ cnnform3 ] ) over that of reaction ( [ cnnform1 ] ) in contrast to the case without anions .",
    "whilst the effect on the abundances of c@xmath29 and c@xmath29h due to the inclusion of their respective anions may come as little surprise , other families of species are also affected .",
    "figure  [ figure4 ]  ( a ) shows the time - dependent fractional abundance of c@xmath29h@xmath1 for n = 4 , 6 , 8 , and 10 .",
    "the abundances of all species are enhanced at all times in the model with anions included , with a more marked effect for c@xmath6h@xmath1 and c@xmath22h@xmath1 . in the absence of anions , the c@xmath29h@xmath1 species form via dissociative recombination , e.g. reactions ( [ dissattach1 ] ) and ( [ dissattach2 ] ) , or via neutral - neutral reactions , @xmath55 adding anions to the chemistry opens a new synthetic channel via associative detachment of the hydrocarbon anions , c@xmath0h@xmath3 , with h atoms ( reaction [ [ hreact ] ] ) and it is this channel which dominates up to @xmath56 yr .",
    "the c@xmath0h@xmath1 species in the dominant polyyne isomer , hc@xmath0h , are not observable via rotational spectroscopy because this isomer has zero dipole moment .",
    "the cumulene carbene forms h@xmath1c@xmath41 are detectable but in general can not be formed by associative detachment because the reactions are endothermic @xcite .",
    "figure  [ figure4 ]  ( b ) shows the abundances of the hc@xmath0n molecules for n = 3 , 5 , 7 , and 9 and again we see a marked enhancement in the abundances of all species when anions are included in the networks .",
    "the synthesis of the larger cyanopolyyne molecules proceeds ( as for many neutral molecules ) via the dissociative recombination of a cationic molecular precursor : @xmath57 with a secondary route through the reaction @xmath58 the addition of anions to the chemistry enhances the abundances of the c@xmath29h@xmath1 species which increases the effect of reaction ( [ hcnnform3 ] ) .",
    "there is also a more subtle influence on the abundances of h@xmath1c@xmath29n@xmath16 and h@xmath7c@xmath29n@xmath16 which are produced via a series of different reaction pathways originating from hydrocarbon cations , c@xmath29h@xmath59@xmath16 , the abundances of which are enhanced in the presence of molecular anions .",
    "examples of this type of reaction are @xmath60 in addition , the inclusion of c@xmath7n@xmath3 and c@xmath8n@xmath3 introduces new formation mechanisms for hc@xmath7n and hc@xmath8n via associative electron detachment of each anion with h atoms .",
    "this reaction has a fast rate coefficient , on the order of 10@xmath61 @xmath19 s@xmath20 , which has a large effect on the abundance of hc@xmath8n , in particular .",
    "the destruction of the hydrocarbon anions c@xmath29h@xmath9 via reactions with atomic n ( reaction [ [ nreact ] ] ) has an associative detachment channel , which leads to the cyanopolyyne molecules for n = 3 , 5 , 7 , and 9 .",
    "the rate coefficients for these reactions have been derived from experimental data by @xcite who found that the reactions of anions with an even number of carbon atoms proceed slowly , with rate coefficients on the order of 10@xmath62 @xmath19 s@xmath20 . branching ratios for the products",
    "were not determined , although contact with the authors led to their agreement that the associative detachment channel to form the cyanopolyynes could have a branching fraction of @xmath47 0.5 . for reactions with odd numbers of carbons in the hydrocarbon anions ,",
    "i.e. n = 3 , 5 , 7 , and 9 , we have assumed that the reactions proceed with a rate coefficient the same order of magnitude , with an associative detachment channel that has a branching fraction 50% of the total rate",
    ". inclusion of this reaction channel has little effect on the hc@xmath0n abundances due to the small rate coefficient used ; however , we have also run a model with this reaction channel proceeding using a larger rate coefficient of @xmath63 @xmath19 s@xmath20 , on the basis that the reactions between c@xmath0h@xmath3 species with odd values of n and atomic nitrogen are spin allowed .",
    "the results from this `` third '' model are also shown in figure  [ figure4 ]  ( b ) ( dotted lines ) in addition to the results from the model without anions ( solid lines ) and our standard model with anions ( dotted - dashed lines ) .",
    "the associative detachment channel futher enhances the abundances of hc@xmath49n and hc@xmath50n in particular , two molecules for which existing chemical networks have difficulty reproducing the observed abundances . at the time of best agreement in the third model ( @xmath64 yr ) , the abundances are in vastly better agreement with the observed abundances listed in table [ table2 ] although they still lie somewhat below observational values .      in table",
    "[ table2 ] , the abundances of species that agree to within one order of magnitude at the time of best overall agreement are in normal type , those predicted to be more than one order of magnitude too large are in bold italic type and those predicted to be more than one order of magnitude too small are in roman bold type .",
    "it is immediately apparent that the inclusion of anions in both networks does not have a dramatic effect on the agreement with observation .",
    "specifically , removing the anions from rate06 reduces the percentage of molecular abundances that lie within one order of magnitude of those observed from @xmath65 ( 35 out of 53 species ) to @xmath66 ( 32 out of 51 species ) .",
    "the improvement when anions are included is minor but noticeable .",
    "important molecules for which the inclusion of anions improves agreement with observation are hc@xmath8n , hc@xmath49n and hc@xmath50n ( as discussed in detail in  [ hcnn ] ) , while the only molecule for which the inclusion of anions has a significantly detrimental effect on agreement with observation is c@xmath6h .",
    "both networks have difficulty reproducing the observed abundances of the sulfur - containing molecules , h@xmath1s , so , c@xmath1s , so@xmath1 , and hcs@xmath16 , due in part to the choice of the low initial elemental abundance for s@xmath16",
    ". a slightly higher choice can improve agreement strongly @xcite . with our current elemental abundance , so , c@xmath1s , and so@xmath1 , all reach good agreement with observation at later times between @xmath67 and @xmath68 yr .",
    "later times than the time of best agreement may pertain to cloudlets in tmc-1 other than the cp region , where most complex species peak @xcite .",
    "the calculated abundances of several organic molecules are much lower than that observed , especially for ch@xmath7oh , ch@xmath7cch , and ch@xmath1chcn .",
    "all these species are difficult to synthesize using gas - phase processes only .",
    "it has been thought for some time that saturated species , in particular , ch@xmath7oh , form on the surfaces of dust grains through the repeated hydrogenation of co @xcite , a claim backed up by some experimental evidence @xcite .",
    "the relatively small differences observed when anions are included in our models are partially due to their low abundance compared with electrons , as shown in figure  [ figure5 ] for rate06 .",
    "this is in contrast to the findings of @xcite who compute that after @xmath69 yr , negatively charged small pahs are the dominant negative charge carrier with an abundance almost two orders of magnitude larger than the electron abundance at steady state .",
    "this effect diminishes with increasing pah size ( and thus decreasing fractional abundance ) .",
    "with pahs the dominant negative charge carriers , the overall ionization decreases because atomic positive ions are more readily neutralized by pah@xmath3 than by bare electrons .",
    "this decrease results in increases in the abundances of positively charged molecular ions , which in turn lead to increases in the abundances of unsaturated neutral species such as the cyanopolyynes and saturated species such as methanol . despite the increase in the abundance of methanol ,",
    "however , the computed abundance lies well below the observed one .",
    "future models should investigate the effects of adding both negatively charged pahs as well as molecular anions .",
    "in this work we have used oxygen - rich initial abundances with a carbon - to - oxygen ratio of @xmath70 .",
    "previous modellers @xcite have found that to get better agreement with observations of chemical abundances in tmc-1 ( cp ) , a higher ratio is required , usually @xmath71 .",
    "the most successful of the models listed is the work of @xcite who report that with a carbon - to - oxygen ratio of 1.2 , 86% of the abundances can be fit if the observations are given an uncertainty of a factor of five .",
    "these authors use as a criterion for success an overlap between gaussian distributions of modeling and observational results for each species , the former obtained by a monte carlo analysis from uncertainties in both reaction rate coefficients and physical conditions .    to test the effects that the addition of anions has on carbon - rich models of the chemistry of dark clouds",
    ", we have run models using both networks with a carbon - to - oxygen ratio of 1.2 , with and without anions . using rate06 without anions , at the time of best agreement",
    ", 40 out of 51 species agree with observation to within one order of magnitude , an improvement similar to that found by @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the oxygen - rich initial conditions , we find that the addition of anions in the carbon - rich case worsens our agreement with observation for both networks .",
    "for rate06 with anions , the agreement is reduced to 37 out of 53 species at the optimum time .",
    "the results with the osu network are similar . in the carbon - rich case ,",
    "the increased synthetic power obtained upon adding anions is magnified due to the increased carbon budget so that the calculated abundances of long - chain carbon molecules substantially overshoot the observed abundances , thus worsening the overall agreement with observation . even in the case without anions , the better agreement obtained with carbon - rich abundances may be at least partially due to an edge effect , in which much of the carbon budget ends up in the longer - chained species .",
    "since many of these species have not been observed in tmc-1 , it is difficult to say whether the enhanced agreement is real or a result of the chemistry being limited to molecules with 11 carbon atoms or fewer .",
    "we have modelled the gas - phase chemistry of a dark cloud to investigate the role of molecular anions in the overall chemistry .",
    "we have used the simple pseudo - time - dependent gas - phase model , which can be criticized both for its lack of dynamics during the chemical evolution and for the lack of processes involving dust grains .",
    "nevertheless , our use of the simplified gas - phase model has enabled us to highlight the direct chemical effects of the addition of molecular anions on our existing standard networks .",
    "the inclusion of anions has only a slight positive effect on the success of both the rate06 and osu networks in reproducing the observed abundances in tmc-1 ( cp ) with the pseudo - time - dependent model .",
    "the most significant effect of the addition of anionic species is the enhancement in the abundances of several families of carbon - chain molecules , namely , c@xmath0 , c@xmath0h , c@xmath0h@xmath1 , c@xmath0n , and hc@xmath0n , by providing new formation routes to the larger members of each family via smaller molecules .",
    "we get much better agreement with abundances observed in tmc-1 ( cp ) for the cyanopolyyne molecules , in particular , and would urge further experimental measurements of the rate coefficient and product channels for reaction  ( [ nreact ] ) , which we have shown to be an important formation route to the hc@xmath72n molecules .",
    "this ` catalytic ' effect could be at least partially artificial because our chemistry is capped at molecules with 11 or fewer carbon atoms , so that we may be witnessing an ` edge ' effect whereby molecules move up the chain through repeated addition of a carbon atom with the larger molecules becoming a ` sink ' for carbon . to check",
    "if this is the case , it may be necessary to add larger carbon - chain species to the chemistry , similar to that done by @xcite for their chemical model of the shell of irc+10216 .",
    "credence is given to our results , however , as the peak abundances of the molecules remain inversely proportional to molecular size even given this catalytic effect .",
    "we have also investigated the effect of using carbon - rich elemental abundances .",
    "running models using both networks , with and without anions , with a carbon - to - oxygen ratio of 1.2 , we find that we get improved agreement for tmc-1 ( cp ) over the oxygen - rich case for the carbon - rich models without anions .",
    "the inclusion of anions , however , worsens our agreement with observation due to the excessively enhanced synthesis of long - chain carbon species .",
    "many of the large number of reactions involving anions that have been added to the reaction sets remain poorly understood .",
    "although our results here show that the inclusion of anions does not have a dramatic effect on the chemistry , these conclusions must remain tentative pending further experimental work to determine more accurate rate coefficients .",
    "it is anticipated that in the near future , further anionic species will be discovered as laboratory measurements of the rotational spectra of candidate molecules increase in number , and we would expect that existing chemical networks will be expanded to incorporate molecular anions as standard .",
    "the current ( anionic and non - anionic ) releases of both rate06 and the osu network are available online at http://www.udfa.net/ and http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/@xmath4eric/ , respectively .",
