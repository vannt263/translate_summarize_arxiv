    "the case for linking sgr  a * , the radio source at the center of the milky way , with a supermassive black hole is very strong .",
    "mass estimates inferred from stellar orbits , proper motion studies that indicate sgr  a * is nearly motionless , vlbi observations that reveal it is ultracompact , and short - timescale variability from radio to x - rays all point towards sgr  a * s association with a @xmath0 black hole ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "at a distance of @xmath2kpc , the schwarzschild radius of this black hole subtends @xmath3as , making the apparent size of its event horizon the largest that we know of .",
    "vlbi at ( sub)millimeter wavelengths is ideally suited to observing sgr  a * on these angular scales .",
    "previous 1.3  mm vlbi detections of sgr  a * on a hawaii - arizona baseline established the existence of coherent structures on scales of a few @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "current 1.3  mm vlbi observations can be used to address two fundamental questions concerning the nature of sgr  a*. the first is whether the accretion flow surrounding sgr  a * exhibits an expected `` shadow '' feature that occurs due to the strong gravitational lensing near the black hole . emission from the accretion flow is preferentially lensed onto the last photon orbit , resulting in a relatively dim central region encircled by a brighter annulus @xcite .",
    "a second question is whether the flaring behavior exhibited by sgr  a * has its origins in compact structures that arise near the black hole event horizon .",
    "broadband flares on timescales ranging from minutes to hours are well - documented @xcite and imply time - variable structures in the innermost accretion region .",
    "if small - scale variable structures are present , 1.3  mm vlbi can sensitively monitor the changing morphology of sgr  a * using non - imaging techniques with time resolutions of tens of seconds @xcite .",
    "we report on new 1.3  mm vlbi observations of sgr  a * using a four - telescope array .",
    "these observations confirm event horizon scale structure within sgr  a * , impose new constraints on accretion models for sgr  a * , and reveal time - dependent variability on scales of a few @xmath4 .",
    "sgr  a * and several calibrator sources were observed with four telescopes at three observatories : the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ; henceforth also j ) on mauna kea in hawaii , the arizona radio observatory s submillimeter telescope ( aro / smt ; s ) in arizona , and two telescopes of the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ; c and d , located @xmath5  m apart ) in california . on mauna kea , the submillimeter array ( sma ) housed the vlbi recording system and synthesized the hydrogen maser based vlbi reference used at the jcmt .",
    "masers at all sites were checked against ultra - stable crystals ; combined losses due to maser instabilities and local oscillator decoherence are estimated to be @xmath6% .",
    "observations occurred over three nights : 2009 april 57 ( days 9597 ) .",
    "sources were observed in left circular polarization in two 480  mhz bandwidths centered at 229.089 and 229.601  ghz ( low and high bands ) .",
    "data recorded at all sites was shipped to mit haystack observatory in westford , massachusetts for processing on the mark4 vlbi correlator .",
    "once correlated , data for each scan ( typically 1015 minutes ) were corrected for coherence losses due to atmospheric turbulence and searched for detections using methods detailed in @xcite .",
    "atmospheric coherence times ranged from a few to @xmath7  s , depending on weather conditions at each telescope .",
    "the vlbi correlation coefficient for each baseline was multiplied by the geometric mean of the system equivalent flux density ( sefd ) of both antennas .",
    "the sefd is a product of antenna gain ( jy / k ) and the opacity - corrected system temperature , which was measured just prior to each vlbi scan using a vane calibration technique that corrects for the atmosphere . for the jcmt and aro / smt , antenna gains were determined from observations of planets at several points during the multiple day campaign , and the gains were observed to be stable .",
    "relative gains for the two carma dishes were estimated using observations taken by carma in interferometric array mode before each vlbi scan , and the gains were then set to a common flux scale using planet scans at the end of each night .",
    "the flux densities of all vlbi targets ( sgr  a * , 1924@xmath1292 , m87 , 3c273 , 3c345 ,",
    "1733@xmath1130 , 3c279 , 0854@xmath8201 ) were measured with carma . for sgr  a * ,",
    "data with baselines shorter than 20  k@xmath9 were discarded to filter out extended emission in the galactic center .",
    "the measured flux densities of all sources increased from day 95 to day 96 and from day 96 to day 97 .",
    "we attribute this systematic trend to errors in the planet calibrations made shortly after sunrise , when antenna focus , pointing offsets , and atmospheric coherence typically change .",
    "the flux density measured for the calibrator 1924@xmath1294 , observed over the same time and elevation ranges as sgr  a * , was 9.95 , 10.21 , and 10.75  jy on days 95 , 96 , and 97 .",
    "we normalized carma gains to a constant flux density of 10.25  jy on all three days .",
    "the resulting measured flux densities for sgr a * are 3.03 , 3.16 , and 3.61  jy on days 95 , 96 , and 97 , respectively .",
    "we adopt these fluxes for all subsequent analysis .    as shown in the upper panels of figures  [ fig-1921-scans ] and [ fig - sgra - scans ] , there are still noticeable variations in the correlated flux densities even after renormalizing the day - to - day flux scales .",
    "these residual calibration errors and amplitude variation can be corrected for by making three simplifying assumptions that allow us to use standard  self - calibration \" techniques .",
    "first , the flux densities of detections in the low and high bands , which differ by only 0.2% in frequency , are assumed to be equal in each scan .",
    "second , flux densities on the sc and sd baselines are assumed to be equal . while one could in principle require that jc and jd flux densities be equal as well , the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is generally much lower on the jc and jd baselines than on the shorter vlbi baselines ( sc and sd ) , since both 1924@xmath1292 and sgr  a * are more resolved on longer baselines .",
    "third , carma antenna gains are adjusted to make the correlated flux density on the cd baseline ( with a fringe spacing measured in arcseconds ) equal to the total flux density measured each night by carma .",
    "this final constraint enforces a constant source flux density over the duration of each night of observation .",
    "while some of the observed variation in sgr  a * over the course of a night may be due to intrinsic variability , the 1924@xmath1292 data exhibit similar scatter , suggesting that calibration errors may dominate over source variability .",
    "combined , these assumptions result in a closed - form solution for gain - correction coefficients for telescopes c , d , and s in each band .",
    "henceforth , we will use the term `` gain - corrected '' to refer to flux densities that have been multiplied by these gain - correction coefficients .",
    "we note that if the total flux density ( cd ) is varied , the sj flux densities are unchanged while other flux densities vary as the square root of the factor .",
    "the quasar 1924@xmath1292 was easily detected on all baselines ( table  [ table - detections ] ) . on each scan , low - band and high - band fluxes after a - priori calibration track each other consistently ( figure  [ fig-1921-scans ] ) .",
    "after gain correction assuming a total flux density of @xmath10  jy , the data from all three days are highly consistent with one another .",
    "the sc and sd baselines show consistent variation in the correlated flux density that is repeated each day .",
    "the long - baseline detections ( sj , jc , and jd ) also show day - to - day repeatable behavior , indicating detection of stable source structure presumably associated with a jet @xcite .",
    "the consistency of these data demonstrates the validity of the gain - correction technique .",
    "based on the statistics of the data on scans of 1924@xmath1292 , systematic errors are estimated to be @xmath11% .",
    "+     +     +    we report the first 1.3  mm vlbi detections of sgr  a * on hawaii - california baselines with correlated flux densities for several scans of @xmath12  mjy on the jc and jd baselines during day 96 ( figure  [ fig - sgra - scans ] ) .",
    "nondetections on the jc and jd baselines on day 95 are attributable to the higher opacity at the jcmt on that day .",
    "the robust detections on the long ( hawaii - arizona and hawaii - california ) baselines confirm the detection of event horizon scale structure reported in @xcite .    because sgr  a * was detected on baselines between all three sites , we are able to measure closure phase : the sum of interferometric phase around a closed triangle of baselines .",
    "this quantity is relatively immune to calibration errors and in general provides important constraints on source structure . on the carma - aro / smt - jcmt triangle",
    ", the phase closures on sgr a * for day 96 ( 5 independent measurements ) were computed using 10-second coherent integrations , which were averaged over full 10-minute vlbi scans to increase snr @xcite .",
    "because of the relatively low snr on the long baselines to the jcmt , it is only possible to say that the closure phases are consistent with a value of zero with a variation of @xmath13 .",
    "the arcsecond - scale flux density of sgr  a * on days 95 and 96 is the same to within uncertainties in the flux scale , but on day 97 the flux density of sgr  a * was @xmath14% higher .",
    "this brightening is accompanied by changes on vlbi scales as well .",
    "first , the sc / cd and sd / cd flux density ratios are higher on day 97 than on days 95 and 96 ( figure  [ fig - sgra - scans ] ) .",
    "second , there are more hawaii - california detections during day 97 , and the apparent flux densities on these baselines are on average higher than on day 96 .",
    "third , the flux densities on the sj baseline are also larger on day 97 .",
    "these differences are consistent with an episode of variability in sgr  a * during which the small - scale structure increased in flux density between days 96 and 97 .",
    "though our data are better calibrated than in the previous epoch @xcite , the structure of sgr  a * is poorly constrained because millimeter vlbi detections of sgr  a * remain limited in terms of baseline length and orientation . as a result",
    ", many models can be made to fit the data : extended double sources , large rings , combinations of large- and small - scale components , etc .    nevertheless , with the caveat that this small dataset should not be overinterpreted , it is instructive to investigate the two classes of models originally considered by @xcite to fit the 1.3  mm vlbi data obtained in 2007 : circular gaussians and rings",
    ". all of the 2007 data points could be fitted by a single gaussian component .",
    "in contrast , we note a loss of @xmath15  jy of correlated flux density between the connected - element ( cd ) and sc / sd baselines ( figure  [ fig - corr ] ) . in the context of gaussian models of emission on @xmath4 scales",
    ", this suggests the existence of additional variable structure on scales between those probed by the sc / sd ( a few hundred microarcseconds ) and the cd ( a few arcseconds ) baselines .",
    "we adopt this assumption to estimate the size of the inner accretion flow in sgr  a*. effectively , this reduces to fitting all of the vlbi data excluding the cd data points . for the gaussian model , the best fits imply a flux density of @xmath16  jy and a size of @xmath17as ( fwhm ; errors are @xmath18 ) on day 95 and @xmath19  jy and @xmath20as on day 96 ( figure  [ fig - corr ] and table  [ table - fits ] ) .",
    "these values are consistent with the single compact component gaussian fit of @xcite , who estimated a flux density of @xmath21  jy and a size of @xmath22as ( before deconvolution of the expected interstellar scattering ; @xmath23as unscattered ) for the 230  ghz emission . on day 97",
    ", the best fit model has a much higher flux density of @xmath24  jy but a similar fwhm of @xmath25as . despite the increase in flux density observed on day 97 , the diameter of the fitted compact component in sgr  a * on that day is identical ( to within the errors ) to the values for the size obtained on days 95 and 96 .",
    "ring models with three parameters ( inner radius , outer radius , and flux density ) can also fit the vlbi data ( figure  [ fig - corr ] and table  [ table - fits ] ) .",
    "however , no single set of ring model parameters consistently fits the data on all three days , which would suggest that the size and structure of sgr  a * are variable within the context of ring models .",
    "this stands in contrast with the gaussian model , for which all epochs of data are consistent with a uniform size despite differences in the flux density .",
    "longer - wavelength vlbi observations are inconclusive as to whether a significant correlation exists between the flux density and size of the emission in sgr  a * @xcite . however , the size of the emission at these wavelengths is dominated by interstellar scattering effects .",
    "future 1.3  mm vlbi observations with higher sensitivity , sufficient to robustly measure the closure phase , will be an important discriminant between these and other models .",
    "for example , an elliptical gaussian distribution will result in zero closure phase on any triangle of baselines , while a ring model can result in closure phases of 180 degrees depending on the orientation and length of the array baselines .",
    "the ring models shown in figure  [ fig - corr ] all have closure phases of zero on the carma - aro / smt - jcmt triangle of baselines , consistent with the measured closure phases ( section  [ results ] ) .",
    "however , a ring model with a null near @xmath26  @xmath27 between the carma - jcmt and aro / smt - jcmt baselines , would produce a closure phase of 180 degrees , which is strongly ruled out by the april 2009 data .",
    "measurement on an intermediate baseline in the @xmath28  @xmath27 range would provide a powerful discriminant between large classes of geometrical models .",
    "the flux density of sgr  a * on vlbi scales is seen to increase from day 95/96 to day 97 . during the first @xmath15 hour on day 97 , when the atmosphere at carma was relatively stable , the data are consistent with a constant flux density , suggesting that the flux density increased before observations on day 97 but held steady at a higher level than on the previous nights .",
    "this behavior is consistent with other ( sub)millimeter observations , which show variability punctuated with periods when the flux density is stable ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the flux density increase appears to be due to an event that establishes a new steady - state in sgr  a*. if instead the flux density increase is due to a short - duration event that concluded before the start of observations on day 97 , the unchanging size of the compact region ( as implied by gaussian models in section  [ structure ] ) and the timescale over which the compact flux density is seen to be constant limits the expansion speed of the region to be highly nonrelativistic ( @xmath29 , consistent with * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and much lower than the sound speed ( @xmath30 ) @xcite , in contrast with relativistic jet models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while a low expansion speed is predicted by adiabatically - expanding plasmon models @xcite , these models also predict an increase in source size .",
    "our observations detect sgr  a * after the increase in flux density has occurred , but we do not find evidence of an increase in source size as predicted by adiabatic expansion .",
    "future , more sensitive observations of sgr  a * before , during , and after a flare event will be necessary to more fully understand the mechanism responsible for variability in sgr  a*.      numerous physically - motivated models have been advanced to explain the multiwavelength emission from sgr  a * ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in recent years , several efforts to constrain disk models using 1.3  mm vlbi observations have placed limits on model parameters such as the inclination of the disk and the spin of the black hole .",
    "radiatively inefficient accretion flow models and some general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations found that the @xcite data were already sufficient to rule out a low - inclination ( i.e. , nearly face - on ) disk @xcite .",
    "low - inclination disk models are qualitatively similar to the ring model in section  [ structure ] , with a `` null '' in the correlated flux density as a function of baseline length whose depth decreases with increasing disk inclination @xcite .",
    "the location of this null as a function of baseline length is set by the ratio of the mass of the black hole and the distance to sgr  a * , which is determined to within a few percent @xcite .",
    "emission in high - inclination models is dominated by the highly doppler - boosted approaching side of the disk .",
    "high - inclination disk models exhibit a monotonic decrease in flux density as baselines approach the length of the sj baseline , with long - baseline correlated flux densities highly dependent on the orientation of the disk in the plane of the sky . the decline of correlated flux density with baseline length from hawaii - california to hawaii - arizona baselines requires that the inclination be @xmath31 in several disk models that were consistent with the 2007 data @xcite . the impact of the 2009 hawaii - california detections on the 2007 fits is to strengthen the constraint on inclination in these models ( e.g. , broderick et al .",
    ", private communication ) .",
    "vlbi observations of sgr  a * at 1.3 mm wavelength in 2009 have robustly confirmed the detection of schwarzschild radius scale structures reported in @xcite . on the third of three days of observations ,",

    "the vlbi data support a picture in which this flux density increase is due to a brightening of structure on scales of only a few @xmath4 .",
    "having achieved the dual technical milestones of successfully detecting closure phase and developing robust methods of amplitude calibration , it is clear that future ( sub)millimeter vlbi observations with higher sensitivity and many more baselines will be able to powerfully constrain models of sgr  a * on event horizon scales .",

    "<S> sagittarius  a * , the @xmath0 black hole candidate at the galactic center , can be studied on schwarzschild radius scales with ( sub)millimeter wavelength very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) . </S>",

    "<S> graham in arizona , and two telescopes of the carma array at cedar flat in california . </S>",
    "<S> both sgr  a * and the quasar calibrator 1924@xmath1292 were observed over three consecutive nights , and both sources were clearly detected on all baselines . </S>",
    "<S> for the first time , we are able to extract 1.3  mm vlbi interferometer phase information on sgr  a * through measurement of closure phase on the triangle of baselines . on the third night of observing , the correlated flux density of sgr  a * on all vlbi baselines increased relative to the first two nights , providing strong evidence for time - variable change on scales of a few schwarzschild radii . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that future vlbi observations with greater sensitivity and additional baselines will play a valuable role in determining the structure of emission near the event horizon of sgr  a*. </S>"
