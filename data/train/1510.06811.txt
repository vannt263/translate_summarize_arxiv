    "black widow and redback msps ( hereafter redbacks ) are two sub - populations of eclipsing msps with orbital periods @xmath2 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) .",
    "while redbacks have relatively more massive companions ( @xmath3 ) , the companion masses in black widow binaries are significantly lower ( @xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "the most striking feature of both types of binaries is their regular radio eclipses around superior conjunction ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "these deep eclipses indicate a low - density , highly - ionized gas cloud enwrapping the companions , but the origin of the eclipsing material is not clear .",
    "consider the compact orbits and the fact that they are associated with @xmath5-ray sources , the eclipsing material could originate from the companions evaporated by the high - energy particles from the msps @xcite . alternatively",
    ", the nearly roche - lobe ( rl ) filling companions @xcite suggest that there may be roche - lobe overflow ( rlof ) in these binaries , and the overflowing matter is stopped and blown away by the msp s radiation pressure at the inner lagrangian point @xcite .",
    "notably , all the three transitional msps discovered so far are redbacks , which have a currently known population of 17 sources ( see table 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with a systematic x - ray study of eight nearby redbacks , @xcite defined three ( pulsar , disk , and outburst ) states according to their x - ray luminosities . in the pulsar state ,",
    "the x - ray luminosities are in the range of @xmath6 , and they exhibit radio eclipses and pulsations @xcite . in the disk state with @xmath7 , the disk lines can be detected in the optical band accompanied with fast bimodal switching in x - rays @xcite .",
    "the ( full accretion ) outburst state with @xmath8 has been detected only in psr j1824@xmath12452i so far @xcite .    in the general picture of the ns@xmath1accretion disk interaction ,",
    "the inner radius of a geometrically thin accretion disk is truncated at the magnetospheric radius where the energy of the ns magnetic field equals the kinetic energy of the infalling matter in the disk @xcite : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the magnetic moment of the ns , @xmath11 the ns mass , @xmath12 the accretion rate , and @xmath13 the gravitational constant . with a high enough accretion rate , the magnetospheric radius can be inside the corotation radius at which the keplerian angular velocity in the disk is equal to the angular velocity @xmath14 of the ns : @xmath15 , and the accreting matter can be channeled by the field lines to reach the ns surface .",
    "if the accretion rate is reduced and the magnetospheric radius expands outside the corotation radius , a significant fraction of the accreting matter may be ejected from the system with the so - called propeller effect @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if the accretion rate is so low that the magnetospheric radius is beyond the light cylindrical radius ( where the corotating velocity matches the speed of light , @xmath16 ) , the disk is disrupted and a radio pulsar switches on .",
    "so , to account for the mass outflows and transitional behavior in redbacks , we require a significant variation in the mass accretion rate during the binary evolution .    based on this argument , three models have been proposed for the formation of redbacks by invoking interrupted mass transfer processes . below",
    "we briefly review these models .    _",
    "1 . the disrupted magnetic braking ( mb ) model _",
    "mass transfer in short orbital period lmxbs is driven by angular momentum loss ( aml ) due to mb and gravitational radiation ( gr ) .",
    "when its mass decreases to around @xmath17 , the donor becomes fully convective and the mb - induced aml is greatly reduced , leading to rl decoupling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as a result , the mass transfer is temporarily halted .",
    "@xcite assumed that a msp then switches on and begins to evaporate its companion star with high - energy radiation .",
    "they investigated the subsequent binary evolution , and showed that adopting different values of the evaporation efficiency could account for the formation of both black widows and redbacks . in this model",
    "it is hard to explain a few redbacks with relatively large companion masses ( @xmath18 ) and long orbital periods ( @xmath19 day ) .",
    "the authors suggested that these systems may have been temporarily detached earlier for some reasons , then turned into the evaporation stage with a relatively massive companion star .",
    "_ 2 . the irradiation - induced cyclic mass transfer model _    when the donor star in a lmxb is irradiated by the x - rays from the accreting ns",
    ", its intrinsic luminosity can be blocked by irradiation @xcite . due to the thermal relaxation of the convective envelope of the donor star , the secular mass transfer could be unstable under some conditions , cycling between low and high states @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that this irradiation instability and cyclic mass transfer processes are popular during the evolution of contracting lmxbs , and they suggested that redbacks may be formed during the low state of the mass transfer . in this scenario , the redback companions should almost fill their rl . by considering the evaporation due to the msp s wind / radiation",
    ", they found that black widows can descend from redbacks , but not all redbacks evolve into black widows .",
    "a caveat is that this model may not work in transient lmxbs , in which the mass transfer cycles would be suppressed due to intermittent irradiation @xcite .",
    "_ 3 . the accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) model _",
    "@xcite suggested that redbacks may be formed during the aic of a white dwarf ( wd ) in cataclysmic variable ( cv)-like systems besides the traditional recycling scenarios . at the time of aic ,",
    "the companion star becomes detached from its rl because of the orbital expansion caused by sudden gravitational mass loss .",
    "the mass transfer halts and the newborn msp starts to ablate its companion . like the cyclic mass transfer model , the aic model can reproduce all redbacks in the @xmath20 plane . however , @xcite pointed out that it is difficult or impossible to produce the requisite occurrence of aic in traditional cvs , unless irradiation - excited wind from the donor star is also taken into account .",
    "more recently , channeled accretion was detected in psr j1023@xmath00038 @xcite , which is actually an accreting millisecond x - ray pulsar ( amxp ) . unlike other amxps , this channeled accretion was discovered at a very low x - ray luminosity @xmath21 , which challenges the traditional accretion - propeller theory @xcite .",
    "similar phenomenon has also been discovered in xss  j12270@xmath14859 @xcite . adding psr j1824@xmath12452i as a typical amxp in the outburst state @xcite",
    ", we note that all the three transitional redbacks exhibit as amxps at the disk or outburst state .",
    "as we know , all the amxps are transient systems @xcite , likely caused by the thermal - viscous instability in the accretion disks ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "it is also noted that , all ns - lmxbs are subject to the disk instability either with evolved companions @xcite or with low main - sequence ( ms ) companions after the cessation of mb , as we show below .",
    "observationally nearly half of the lmxbs in the galactic disk are transient sources @xcite .",
    "based on these features , we consider the thermal - viscous disk instability as a possible mechanism for the formation of redbacks , and investigate their evolutionary sequences .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly introduce the binary evolution model .",
    "our main results on the parameter space of the disk instability and its effect on the lmxb evolution are presented in sections 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "they are then discussed in section 5 and summarized in section 6 .",
    "we calculate the lmxb evolution with an updated version ( 7624 ) of the modules for experiments in stellar astrophysics ( mesa ) @xcite . the binary is initially composed of a ns ( of mass @xmath22 ) and a zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) companion star ( of mass @xmath23 ) with solar chemical compositions .",
    "we use the @xcite formula to calculate the effective rl radius of the companion ( or donor ) star , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the mass ratio and @xmath26 is the orbital separation . to calculate the mass transfer rate via rlof we adopt the ritter scheme @xcite in the code , which takes into account the finite scale height of the stellar atmosphere of the donor , @xmath27.\\ ] ] here @xmath28 depends on the mass ratio , the density at the donor s photosphere and its effective temperature , @xmath29 is the donor s radius",
    ", @xmath30 is the pressure scale height of the atmosphere , and @xmath5 is a function of @xmath31 .",
    "the rate of aml during the evolution consists of three parts : @xmath32 the first term @xmath33 on the right hand side is the rate of gr - induced aml given by @xcite , @xmath34 with @xmath35 the speed of light .",
    "the second term is due to the mass loss from the system .",
    "we assume that a fraction ( @xmath36 ) of the transferred mass is accreted by the ns and the rest is ejected out of the system by isotropic winds , taking away the specific am of the ns , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the angular velocity of the binary orbit .",
    "we also assume that the accretion rate @xmath39 is limited by the eddington critical rate , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the hydrogen abundance and @xmath42 is the ns radius , taken to be @xmath43 .",
    "our previous work shows that the value of @xmath36 does not significantly affect the evolutionary tracks of lmxbs @xcite , so here we fix its value to be 0.5 .",
    "thus , @xmath44 .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "( 3 ) represents the aml due to mb , for which we adopt the standard formula @xcite , @xmath45 we assume that mb is reduced when the star s convective envelope is very thin , and add an ad hoc factor to @xmath46 @xcite ,    @xmath47  ( if @xmath48 ,    where @xmath49 is the mass fraction of the surface convective envelope .",
    "we also terminate mb when the central stellar radiative zone vanishes .",
    "the accretion disk in a lmxb becomes thermally and viscously unstable when the mass transfer rate drops below a critical value .",
    "then the lmxb may appear as a transient source experiencing limit cycles between short outbursts and long quiescent intervals with a duty cycle @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "here we adopt the critical mass transfer rate for an irradiated disk given by @xcite , @xmath51 once @xmath52 , we simply assume that there is no accretion during quiescence , and the matter flow accretes at a rate of @xmath53 during outbursts . here",
    "we set the duty cycle @xmath54 throughout this paper .",
    "since the evolution time steps in the code are usually much longer than the disk outburst cycle time , the average mass transfer rate from the donor star actually remains the same as in the case of stable disk accretion , but the accreted mass by the ns is considerably reduced .",
    "we calculate the evolution of a grid of lmxbs with a @xmath55 ns and a donor star of initial mass @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the initial orbital periods @xmath58 is set to range from @xmath59 day to @xmath60 days , to cover the evolution of cv - like , ultra - compact and wide lmxbs @xcite .",
    "we show some of the calculated evolutionary tracks in the @xmath20 plane ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "from left to right , the three panels correspond to @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively . in each panel",
    "the green solid and red dotted lines represent the mass transfer processes with stable and unstable accretion disks , respectively .",
    "the black dashed lines denote the stage of rl detachment ( i.e. , without mass transfer ) . the asterisk on each evolutionary track indicates that the accreted mass reaches @xmath61 , a typical amount to spin up a ns to millisecond periods @xcite .",
    "the dot - dashed line shows the relation between the orbital period and the ( wd ) core mass of the donor ( i.e. , @xmath62 relation ) after case b mass transfer @xcite .",
    "here we use the calculated results of @xcite .",
    "the two brown dashed lines give the orbital periods when the donor star is on zams and terminal - age main - sequence ( tams ) .",
    "they are obtained by combining the orbital period - donor radius relation @xcite @xmath63 with the mass - radius relations @xcite for zams stars , @xmath64 0.89(m_{2}/m_{\\odot})^{0.89}~r_{\\odot}\\ \\ ( { \\rm for}\\ m_2<1.66m_{\\odot})\\\\ 1.01(m_{2}/m_{\\odot})^{0.57}~r_{\\odot}\\ \\ ( { \\rm for}\\ m_2>1.66m_{\\odot})\\\\ \\end{aligned } \\right.,\\ ] ] and for tams stars , @xmath65 respectively .    in fig .  1 we also plot the known redbacks with open diamonds and suqares in the galactic field ( field redbacks ) and globular clusters ( gc redbacks ) listed in @xcite , respectively .",
    "note that we have recalculated their masses by assuming a ns mass of @xmath66 instead of @xmath67 in @xcite .",
    "@xcite divided the lmxb evolution into 7 cases according to the evolutionary state of the donor star and the mass transfer mode .",
    "our calculations demonstrate that the lmxbs are persistent , i.e. , non - transient , in the following cases when the mass transfer is driven by ( 1 ) mb for cv - like lmxbs with ms donors ; ( 2 ) thermal expansion of a massive evolved donor ; and ( 3 ) gr in ultra - compact systems with @xmath68 .",
    "figure  2 shows some illustrative examples of mass transfer rates in the black solid lines .",
    "we divide the evolutionary tracks into three types according to whether the initial orbital period being longer or shorter than , or close to the so - called the `` bifurcation period '' @xcite .",
    "the red dashed lines depict the critical mass transfer rates for comparison .",
    "the bottom row of fig .  2 shows the evolutions of contracting systems . in the case of @xmath69 and @xmath70",
    "day , the mass transfer begins when the companion star is still unevolved , so mb dominates the aml and the mass transfer rate is initially above @xmath71 .",
    "when the donor becomes fully convective , mb stops and aml is solely caused by gr , the mass transfer rate drops down below @xmath72 and the binary becomes transient .",
    "when @xmath73 and @xmath74 day , in the initial stage of the mass transfer , mb takes no effect because the donor has a radiative envelope , and the accretion disk is unstable because of the low mass transfer rate .",
    "when the stripped donor star has developed a convective envelope , mb starts to work and the binary becomes persistent .",
    "the following evolution is similar to the case of @xmath75 . for a more massive donor with @xmath76 and @xmath77",
    "day , mass transfer proceeds rapidly on a thermal timescale @xcite . after that",
    "the mass transfer rate decays . when the donor mass is comparable to the ns mass before mb takes effect , the mass transfer rate drops below @xmath78 and produces a dip .",
    "the subsequent evolution is also similar to the previous cases .",
    "the evolutions of widening binaries are shown in the top row of fig .",
    "2 . when @xmath79 and @xmath80 days , different from the contracting binaries , the donor star is evolved and the mass transfer is driven by the stellar expansion due to shell burning on the red giant branch , which results in a expanding orbit and a much higher @xmath71 . accordingly , we see that the mass transfer rate is always below @xmath71 . in the cases of @xmath81 ,",
    "@xmath82 days , and @xmath76 , @xmath83 days , a mass transfer rate above @xmath84 is reached at the initial stage .",
    "as the evolution proceeds , the mass transfer rate descends while @xmath71 increases due to orbital expansion , so the disks become unstable for wider systems .",
    "the final evolutionary products are msp - he wd binaries .    the middle row of fig .",
    "2 presents examples just between contracting and widening binaries , with the final orbital periods around 1 day . at the beginning of mass transfer , the donor star is on the ms , similar as in contracting binaries , and the accretion disk is stable",
    ". then the mass transfer rate gradually declines to be below @xmath71 , due to the slight expansion of the donor during the ms evolution . for @xmath76 , there is a spike in the mass transfer rate at @xmath85 , which indicates the end of the ms evolution .",
    "the donor star evolves rapidly to pass through the hertzsprung gap , when its h - exhausted core mass exceeds the schnberg - chandrasekhar limit . in the case of @xmath69 , there is not such a spike since the schnberg - chandrasekhar limit is irrelevant for lower mass ( @xmath86 ) stars , in which electron degeneracy pressure dominates the he core .",
    "these stars can gradually transit from central- to shell - hydrogen burning with no hertzsprung gap in the h - r diagram .",
    "go back to fig .  1",
    ", we see that the parameter space for the occurrence of the disk instability covers the distribution of known redbacks .",
    "if msp activity switches on during the quiescent phase of lmxbs ( as observed in the three transitional pulsars ) , it may lead to the formation of redbacks .",
    "considering the fact that the evaporation processes can be rather complicated , here we adopt the simple picture that , when a ns in a lmxb spins at millisecond periods and the mass transfer rate declines to be low enough , a radio pulsar will turn on and prevent further accretion @xcite ; meanwhile , part of the spin - down energy is used to evaporate the companion star @xcite .",
    "therefore , we assume that evaporation in lmxbs takes place once the following two conditions are satisfied : ( 1 ) during the mass transfer phase , a ns has accreted at least @xmath87 mass to be recycled as a msp , and ( 2 ) the mass accretion rate decreases significantly , either due to a decrease in the mass transfer rate or because the accretion disk becomes unstable .",
    "we note that , if the disk is in an unstable state , evaporation can take place effectively simultaneously as far as the evolution time steps in the code are concerned .",
    "our calculations show that there can be either rlof or not along with evaporation , depending on the subsequent evolution of the stellar radius and the rl radius ( see discussion in next section ) . in the case of evaporation accompanied with rlof , we assume that the accretion disk is outside the light cylinder ( at @xmath88 km ) during the quiescent phase , then the ns does not accrete and acts as a radio pulsar .",
    "the material in the inner disk is blown away from the binary , but most of the transferred material from the companion star continues to accumulate in the outer region of the disk ( @xmath89 km ) .",
    "when the disk switches to the outburst phase , the disk material rapidly accretes onto the ns and the pulsar shuts off .",
    "since the accretion rates during outbursts are generally super - eddington , most of the material is also assumed to be lost from the binary .",
    "thus , considering the long evolution time steps in the calculation , we assume that almost all of the transferred matter is ejected , taking away the specific am of the ns .    in the mean time , to explore the evaporation effect on the secular evolution , we assume that evaporation proceeds at a rate @xcite , @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the escape velocity at the surface of the companion star , @xmath92 is the ns s spin - down luminosity , and @xmath93 is the efficiency of evaporation .",
    "here @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 are the moment of inertia , the spin period and its derivative of the ns , respectively .",
    "we assume that the evaporating material takes away the specific am of the companion star .",
    "when a radio pulsar turns on , we assume that its spin evolves following the standard magnetic dipole radiation model with a constant braking index @xmath97 @xcite , and neglect the change in @xmath95 due to accretion during outbursts because of their short duration .",
    "we take typical values of the initial spin period @xmath98 ms , period derivative @xmath99 , and moment of inertia @xmath100 .",
    "similar to fig .  1",
    ", we show a series of evolutionary sequences in fig .  3 taking into account the evaporation effect , where we set the efficiency factor @xmath101 .",
    "the beginning of evaporation is denoted with a pentagram on each evolutionary track . in some cases",
    "it starts due to a drop of the mass transfer rate when the companion mass is comparable with the ns mass , as shown in fig .",
    "comparison between figs .",
    "1 and 3 demonstrates that evaporation can considerably alter the evolution of lmxbs , in broad agreement of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the orbital period evolution in fig .  3",
    "is more flattened than in @xcite and @xcite , since we take account of the aml due to the evaporating material .",
    "this feature can be illustrated as follows .",
    "the orbital angular momentum of the binary is @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the total mass .",
    "logarithmically differentiating the above equation with respect to time gives the change in the orbital separation due only to evaporative mass loss from the companion star , @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the specific am of the evaporative wind in units of the binary s specific am .",
    "if the evaporative wind carries the specific am of the companion star , we have @xmath106 in the limit where @xmath107 , eq .",
    "( 14 ) becomes @xmath108 thus if @xmath109 ( i.e. , no aml due to evaporative mass loss ) the orbit will expand considerably , while if @xmath110 the orbit will not expand at all .    in fig .",
    "4 we display how evaporation influences the binary evolution for the three cases in fig .",
    "the black solid and blue dotted lines represent the rlof mass transfer rate and the evaporative wind loss rate , respectively .",
    "we start with the cv - like contracting systems as shown in the bottom row of fig .",
    "evaporation takes place when the donor star decouples from its rl due to the cessation of mb , same as in @xcite , but the orbital periods of the resultant redbacks are around 0.1 day , different from in the range of @xmath111 day in @xcite .",
    "as mentioned before , for donor stars with mass @xmath112 and @xmath57 , there exists a dip in the mass transfer rate ( which is below @xmath113 ) before mb operates .",
    "evaporation may also take place at this time if the ns has accreted enough mass to be recycled as a msp .",
    "this suggests the possibility of detecting redbacks with @xmath114 .",
    "when the donor s mass decreases to @xmath115 , its convective envelope is developed and mb starts to operate , then the mass transfer increases and evaporation stops .",
    "it will start again when the companion star is detached from its rl .    the top row of fig .",
    "4 presents the evolutions in the case of widening systems . mass accretion of nss is generally inefficient in these systems , because of both short evolutionary time and transient behavior , so the nss may not be fully recycled .",
    "nevertheless , for relatively massive donor stars such as @xmath116 , the ns can still accrete enough mass during the intermediate - mass x - ray binary phase @xcite , and we may expect redbacks with subgiant companions and orbital periods up to tens of days . in the case of @xmath117 and @xmath83 days , at the end of evolution , the binary undergoes a short - lived ( @xmath118 yrs ) episode of additional rlof as a result of the hydrogen shell flashes on the proto - wd ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the resultant msp - he wd binaries follow the @xmath62 relation because the companions are generally rl filling .",
    "however , all redbacks discovered so far are in relatively compact orbits with period less than @xmath119 day , so there seems to be a gap between observations and theoretical expectation , and we will return to this point later .    in the middle row of fig .",
    "4 the orbital periods of redbacks are distributed around @xmath120 day , close to the bifurcation period .",
    "different from the case of the contracting systems , the mass transfer rate drops below @xmath71 before mb ceases .",
    "along with evaporation , the donor star keeps overflowing its rl .",
    "the mass transfer rate declines but the total mass loss rate of the donor star increases .",
    "when the donor star approaches the end of nuclear evolution , its can not adjust immediately to fill its rl , rlof terminates and evaporation starts to dominate the mass loss . in this case the redback companions may either fill or underfill their rls , and the finally formed msp - he wd binaries may slightly deviate from the @xmath62 relation .    in summary , evaporation can considerably influence the secular binary evolution , especially for relatively compact systems .",
    "the switch - on of radio activity and start of evaporation are caused by the transient behavior of lmxbs , as well as disrupted mb .",
    "the predicted parameter space is consistent with the distribution of known redbacks in the @xmath20 plane .",
    "\\(1 ) transitional pulsars and redbacks    we have shown that transient lmxbs that harbor energetic msps may lead to the formation of redbacks .",
    "the three transitional pulsars clearly demonstrate the close relation between redbacks and transient amxps .",
    "moreover , @xcite found a very similar spin distribution between amxps and eclipsing msps , suggesting that the two groups belong to a common class at the same evolutionary epoch .",
    "this is also consistent with our hypothesis that both redbacks and amxps originate from transient lmxbs .",
    "the related questions are : which redbacks can experience transitions to the disk accretion state , and why do nt all transient amxps show radio pulsations during quiescence ?    based on the statistics of the current sample , @xcite divided redbacks into two groups according to their luminosities during the pulsar state , and suggested that the bright ones with x - ray luminosity above @xmath121 are promising candidates to develop accretion disks .",
    "considering the fact that disk accretion always requires rlof , obviously redbacks with a lobe - filling companion are likely to experience transitions to the accretion state , while those with a underfilling companion should stay in the radio pulsar state .",
    "our results show that the redback companions can either fill or underfill their rls , depending on how much mass and am are lost with evaporation .",
    "the condition can be briefly analyzed as follows . for stable mass transfer via rlof , from the condition @xmath122 one can derive the following formula for the mass transfer rate @xcite @xmath123 where @xmath124 represents the change in the companion star s radius under thermal or nuclear evolution , @xmath125 is the aml rate due to mb and gr , @xmath126 is the adiabatic radius - mass exponent , @xmath36 is the fraction of the mass overflowing from the donor star that is retained by the ns , and @xmath127 is the specific am of the lost material in units of the binary s specific am .",
    "if we consider rlof and evaporation simultaneously , we can divide the total mass loss rate of the donor into two parts , @xmath128 , where @xmath129 and @xmath130 are the mass loss rates through rlof and evaporative wind , respectively . assuming",
    "that the mass transfer is partially non - conservative and the winds from the ns and the donor take away the specific am of @xmath131 and @xmath105 , respectively , we can rewrite eq .  ( 18 ) to be , @xmath132 where @xmath133 with @xmath134 and the denominator is , @xmath135    as pointed out by @xcite , stable mass transfer demands both the numerator and denominator of the right hand of eq .",
    "( 20 ) to be positive . if the denominator @xmath136 then the mass transfer is dynamically unstable , while the system will become detached if the numerator is negative .",
    "the evaporative wind can either contribute to , or detract from , the star filling its rl , depending on the am that it takes away .",
    "for stable mass transfer with @xmath137 , the evaporative wind adds a negative term @xmath138 to the numerator , which tends to make the donor star underfill its rl eventually ( as in the case of black widows ) .",
    "however , the details of evaporation are still not clear , in the following we will show how different values of @xmath105 can influence the binary evolution .    finally , although the three transitional pulsars are only a small part of amxps , it is possible that active radio pulsars have indeed turned on during the quiescent state of lmxbs , even with no detected radio pulsations @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) the redback companions    optical / infrared observations can reveal the evolutionary state of the redback companions and the nature of interacting binary systems . statistically , most redbacks possess ms companions which is under strong irradiation with spectral type changes or optical variability between inferior and superior conjunctions @xcite . other types of companion stars are also possible .",
    "for example , for the redback psr j1740@xmath15340 in ngc 6397 , two scenarios were proposed to explain the inferred large mass loss rate from its companion , i.e. a ms star ablated by the msp s impinging flux or inhibited rlof of an evolved star by the pulsar s wind flux @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite investigated the surface chemical abundances of its companion , and suggested the pulsar s companion to be a deeply peeled evolved star . additionally , psr j1816 + 4510 may possess a ( proto-)he wd companion , which is well within its rl @xcite .",
    "therefore , the redback companions could be ms stars , evolved stars or ( proto-)wds . these features are compatible with the expectations in our formation scenario of redbacks .",
    "the condition for the disk instability favors wide systems , and our calculations suggest that transient msp - lmxb systems can form with orbital periods up to tens of days .",
    "it is interesting to note that the longest orbital period of known redbacks is 32.5 hours for psr j1740@xmath15340 . by the way , all discovered amxps",
    "are distributed in a similar range of orbital periods , which are less than 1 day @xcite .",
    "so one would ask why there are no redbacks in wider orbits .",
    "this question is also related to the fact that transient lmxbs with orbital periods longer than 1 day have thus far been rare @xcite .",
    "probably redbacks do possess giant companions , but their number is very small due to their short evolutionary times @xcite .",
    "\\(3 ) efficiency of irradiation and evaporation    unlike cvs , there are few lmxbs with orbital period less than 4 hours , since x - ray irradiation of the donor star alters the long - term evolution of lmxbs @xcite",
    ". it might also be also responsible for the birthrates discrepancy between galactic lmxbs and low - mass binary radio pulsars @xcite .",
    "x - ray irradiation can affect the structure of the donor star by depressing its intrinsic luminosity .",
    "@xcite showed that spherically symmetric irradiation could expand the donor star and elevate the mass transfer rate , hence shortening the timescale of mass transfer ( see however * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite investigated the situation of asymmetrical irradiation , and found that cyclic mass transfer was possible for a significant fraction of lmxbs , due to the irradiation instability ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite proposed that the redback companions should be quasi - rl filling stars during the detached episode of the cyclic mass transfer .",
    "the occurrence of the irradiation instability requires sustained strong irradiation over at least a thermal timescale of the convective envelope of the companion star , which is typically millions of years for a low - mass ms star and much longer than the thermal - viscous timescale ( less than years for compact binaries ) .",
    "the fact that redback systems are distributed in the thermal - viscous instability region , implies the irradiation instability may be suppressed in these binaries due to the intermittent irradiation @xcite .",
    "the formation of eclipsing pulsars like black widows and redbacks also critically depends on the efficiency of evaporation of the companion star and related aml . in the literature",
    ", the proposed energy source of evaporation can be either the spin - down power of a msp @xcite or the accretion power during the lmxb phase @xcite , and we have only considered the former case in this work .",
    "@xcite first realized that msp s evaporation could account for the lack of lmxbs below the period gap .",
    "therefore , to investigate the influence of the evaporation , we perform calculations of the lmxb evolution with @xmath139 and different values of @xmath93 reflects both the geometric effect and the variation in the initial spin - down power , which is fixed in the calculation . ] and aml modes . the results are shown in fig .  5 , in which the line styles and the symbols have the same meanings as in fig .  3 , and we add the black widow systems with data taken from a. patruno s catalogue .",
    "also note that for ultra - compact systems the critical mass transfer rate for unstable disks should be replaced with those for he- or c / o - dominated disks @xcite , but this actually causes very small change of the stable / unstable disk area .    in the upper , middle , and lower panels of fig .  5",
    ", we assume that the evaporative wind takes the specific am of the donor star ( mode a ) , at the inner lagrangian point ( mode b ) , and in the extreme ( non - physical ) case with no am ( mode c ) , while from left to right , we increase the value of @xmath93 in each case . as we see from the figure , with decreasing specific am of the evaporative wind",
    ", the binary eventually evolves to a wider orbit , the duration of rlof is reduced , and the companion star is more likely to be detached from its rl . obviously increasing the value of @xmath93 results in a similar tendency .",
    "@xcite showed that when @xmath140 , evaporation is strong enough to keep the companion star detaches immediately in their aic model .",
    "our calculations indicate that whether the companion star can fill its rl heavily depends on the choice of the evaporation model : the donor star can detach immediately in some sequences of modes b and c , while it can hardly detach after the start of evaporation in mode a , even with a large value of @xmath93 .",
    "the evaporation efficiency also affects the formation of ultra - compact systems below 0.1 day . for contracting systems , after the cessation of mb , gr - induced aml acts as a weak counterweight to the orbital expansion , so ultra - compact systems can be formed only with weak evaporation .",
    "@xcite showed that , when @xmath141 evaporation is not strong enough and the systems can reconnect for another phase of rlof .",
    "figure  5 reveals that this value of @xmath93 also depends on the adopted aml modes , and the orbital evolution is much more sensitive to the values of @xmath93 in modes b and c than in mode a.    \\(4 ) will redbacks evolve to black widows ?    according to @xcite , black widows and redbacks are two distinct populations of eclipsing msps for different evaporation efficiencies due to the geometric effect . on the contrary",
    ", @xcite argued that redbacks with compact orbits would evolve to black widows , while the ones with longer orbital periods would evolve to msp - he wd systems .",
    "basically , whether or not a redback can evolve to a black widow depends on two factors : ( 1 ) the evaporation efficiency , and ( 2 ) the balance between orbital expansion caused by mass transfer / loss and orbital contraction induced by am carried away by the evaporative wind .",
    "our calculations indicate that , for suitable choice of the @xmath93 values , ( at least some of ) compact redbacks can evolve to black widows while the wide ones will form msp - he wd systems in both modes a and b.",
    "this work is motivated by the recent discovery that the three transitional pulsars are both redbacks and transient amxps .",
    "we then suggest the thermal and viscous instability in the accretion disks in lmxbs to be a possible mechanism for the formation of redbacks .",
    "we investigate the parameter space for the occurrence of the disk instability in the evolution of lmxbs , and the influence of evaporation on their secular evolution .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows .",
    "almost all lmxbs are subject to the thermal and viscous instability and experience transient phase(s ) sooner or later in their evolution .",
    "if the nss have be spun up to millisecond periods , the reduction of the mass transfer rate during quiescence provides a plausible mechanism for switching on the pulsar activity and the formation of redbacks , besides the disrupted mb and irradiation instability models .",
    "\\3 . considering the influence of evaporation on the binary evolution ,",
    "some fraction of redbacks evolving along the contracting tracks may become black widows , while the wide ones may form msp - he wd binaries .",
    "the final products are heavily dependent on the evaporation efficiency and the specific am carried away with evaporative mass loss , both of which deserve further study .",
