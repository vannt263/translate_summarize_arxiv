    "one of the novel features of gaseous bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , when considered from a many - body physics perspective , is the ability to directly manipulate the interatomic interaction using external electromagnetic fields @xcite . in the becs realized thus far the interatomic interactions can be described by a single parameter , the s - wave scattering length , @xmath0 , and are short - range in comparison to the average interatomic distance .",
    "the experiment by inouye _",
    "et al _ @xcite demonstrated how the s - wave scattering length can be changed by magnetic fields via a feshbach resonance .",
    "here we consider enhancing and controlling the interatomic interactions using laser - induced dipole - dipole forces .",
    "these interactions are intrinsically long - range and so affect the gas in a way profoundly different from a feshbach resonance . in particular , dipole - dipole interactions , both laser - induced @xcite and static @xcite , have been predicted to be capable of introducing a ` roton ' dip into the bogoliubov excitation spectrum of the bec .",
    "this is behaviour reminiscent of that of the strongly correlated quantum liquid helium ii , and can be understood in terms of feynman s relation which provides an upper bound for the spectrum @xmath1 of helium ii @xmath2 where @xmath3 , known as the static structure factor , is the fourier transform of the pair distribution function .",
    "@xmath3 is a measure of 2nd order correlation in the system .",
    "formula interprets the roton dip in helium ii as being due to a peak in @xmath3 and hence as being due to strong correlations , which are at values of @xmath4 corresponding to phonons having wavelengths on the order of the interatomic spacing ( intuitively : the excitations at these wavelengths require less energy to excite in comparison to neighbouring wavelengths which cost more compressional energy ) .    in a gaseous bec at zero temperature",
    "the bogoliubov theory of a weakly interacting degenerate bose gas @xcite is valid and shows that 2nd order correlation arises predominantly from pairs of atoms scattering out of the condensate to form the so - called quantum depletion , or ` above condensate ' fraction . in a homogenous system",
    "the atoms in these pairs are prefectly correlated , in the sense of perfect two mode - squeezing @xcite . however , in gaseous becs the quantum depletion , and hence 2nd order correlation , is typically very small on account of their diluteness , as expressed through the gas parameter @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the atomic density .",
    "indeed , within the bogoliubov theory the feynman relation ( [ eq : feynman ] ) is an exact equality , yet in a measurement of the bulk excitation spectrum of a regular gaseous bec interacting via s - wave scattering by steinhauer _",
    "et al _ @xcite no roton was seen .",
    "laser - induced dipole - dipole interactions , on the other hand , introduce _ controllable _ ( via laser intensity etc . ) long - range correlations on the scale of the laser wavelength , and one might expect some significant depletion at the corresponding momentum .    in our previous investigations into laser - induced dipole - dipole interactions in a bec @xcite ( and references therein ) we considered the zero - temperature case , and the calculations were limited to the basic bogoliubov method @xcite which does not treat the depletion self - consistently .",
    "our purpose here is to use the so - called popov version of the hartree - fock - bogoliubov method @xcite , which treats the depletion as a self - consistent mean - field in order to include the effects of the the back - action of the depleted fraction upon the condensate .",
    "this method was primarily developed to treat the finite temperature case where depletion is important , but our hope here is to account for significant quantum depletion due to enhanced interactions and also for thermal depletion due to non - zero temperature .",
    "the most significant results we find here are that , perhaps contrary to expectation , the depletion can increase the effects of the dipole - dipole interactions , deepening the roton dip in the spectrum , so that the roton is not diminished by finite - temperature effects but can actually be enhanced .",
    "the idea of exploiting dipole - dipole forces to modify the properties of atomic becs first arose in the context of static dipolar interactions .",
    "a bec of atoms with a large permanent magnetic moment ( e.g.  chromium ) ordered by an external magnetic field , or equivalently , polarizable atoms in a static electric field , has been considered by a number of authors @xcite . here , however , we are interested in fully retarded _ dynamic _ dipole - dipole interactions , such as those induced by an electromagnetic wave ( e.g. laser beam )",
    ". the dynamic dipole - dipole interaction is distinguished from the static case by a longer range ( the retardation gives it an attractive @xmath7 component which can be used in certain geometries to mimic gravity @xcite ) and a huge enhancement of atomic polarizabilty close to a resonance .",
    "we consider a cigar - shaped bec tightly confined in the radial ( _ x , y _ ) plane , irradiated by a plane - wave laser as in @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) .",
    "the laser polarization is along the long z - axis of the condensate to suppress collective ( `` superradiant '' ) rayleigh scattering @xcite or coherent atomic recoil lasing @xcite that are forbidden along the direction of polarization .",
    "the tight confinement along the propagation direction , together with the far off - resonance condition , enables us to treat the electromagnetic field within the born approximation .",
    "the dipole - dipole potential induced by far off - resonance electromagnetic radiation of intensity @xmath8 , wave - vector @xmath9 ( along the y - axis ) , and polarization @xmath10 ( along the z - axis ) is @xcite @xmath11 \\cos \\left(k_{\\mathrm{l } } y \\right ) .",

    "the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) method is concisely described in @xcite .",
    "a reasonable approach within the hfb method is the popov approximation @xcite , which neglects the contribution of the above - condensate fraction to the anomalous correlation function .",
    "the advantage of the popov approximation is that it gives a gapless spectrum of elementary excitations of a degenerate bosonic system in a wide temperature range ( up to the critical temperature ) . in the present paper",
    "we apply the popov approximation to a quasi-1d bec with the laser - induced dipole - dipole interactions at finite temperature . of course",
    ", for an infinitely long 1d gas there is no condensate , even if this gas is non - ideal .",
    "this is because the depletion diverges at infinitely long wavelength .",
    "however , taking into account the finite length @xmath53 of the sample , we set an effective cutoff at a wavelength @xmath54 and thus remove the divergence .",

    "the parameters in cases 1 and 2 are chosen so that a significant ` roton ' dip appears only in the more sophisticated hartree - fock - bogoliubov - popov method , but not in the simple bogoliubov approach .    in each of figures [ fig : spec1][fig : dep2 ] we have plotted three curves .",
    "the solid line gives the results of the hartee - fock - bogoliubov - popov calculation described in section [ sec : hfbp ] . at convergence",
    "we found that in case 1 55  % of atoms remain in the condensate and in case 2 the condensate fraction is 82  % .",
    "the two other curves in the figures give the results obtained within the simple bogoliubov approach and differ in the density that appears in the bogoliubov dispersion relation .",
    "the variant ( a ) uses as the density in the bogoliubov dispersion relation the condensate density @xmath74 obtained in the numerical calculations .",
    "the variant ( b ) uses in the same context as the density the total density of the system , @xmath119 .",
    "similarly , we calculate the depletion within the simple bogoliubov approach for the variants ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the position of the dip centre remains unchanged with temperature .",
    "figures [ fig : spec1 ] and [ fig : spec2 ] show that when the depletion is taken into account self - consistently , the ` roton ' dip in the excitation spectrum can actually become deeper .",
    "this means that the ` roton ' dip persists at finite temperatures ( of course , below the condensation temperature ) .",
    "thus the sample heating due to spontaneous scattering of laser photons need not prevent observation of the ` roton ' dip in the spectrum of the elementary excitations .",
    "contrary to what one might expect , finite temperature effects not only do not wash out or diminish these intermode correlations , but rather serve to enhance them .",
    "this is surprising , considering the noisy character of finite - temperature density fluctuations .",
    "this might in part be because the dipole - dipole potential has a momentum dependence such that it is more effective at finite interatomic momenta ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : exact+appr ] ) .",
    "one may ask : what happens if the laser intensity is increased so that the roton dip passes through the zero - energy axis , so that we obtain imaginary excitation frequencies ?",
    "two scenarios are then possible .",
    "the first one is that this would create a dynamical instability similar to that found in a bec of atoms with negative scattering length @xcite .",
    "the instability would grow exponentially , finally leaving us with a totally depleted bec .",
    "another scenario is the following : when the laser intensity reaches the value at which the roton minimum touches the zero - energy axis we may access a new ground state that is periodically modulated along the @xmath120-axis : a supersolid .",
    "an analogous behaviour had been predicted for superfluid liquid helium passing through a pipe @xcite .",
    "the formation of a supersolid state in a bec with laser - induced dipole - dipole interactions has recently been studied @xcite by numerically integrating the time - dependent generalized gross - pitaevskii equation describing a cigar - shaped bec irradiated by a circularly polarized laser ( in contrast to the linear case considered in the present paper ) , whose wave vector is along the major axis , @xmath120 , of the cigar .",
    "this new supersolid state has to be stable against small perturbations .",
    "one can choose between these two scenarios by numerical investigation of the bec dynamics in the case of gradually - increasing laser intensity , based on a time - dependent generalization of the popov approximation .",
    "such an investigation is beyond the scope of the present paper .    finally , we would like to briefly mention experimentally detectable signatures of the roton minimum . whilst the most convincing method would certainly be to map out the dispersion formula using bragg spectroscopy , as in the measurement by steinhauer _",
    "et al _ @xcite , bragg spectroscopy is technically difficult and time consuming",
    ". a simpler method would be to perform a time - of - flight measurement after releasing the bec from the trap in order to detect the enhanced number of atoms having momenta around the roton minimum .    to summarize ,",
    "we have presented a method allowing self - consistent calculation of the effects of laser - induced dipole - dipole interactions upon a bec in the presence of significant condensate depletion .",
    "this is especially relevant to the experimental situation where the temperature can not be significantly lower than the chemical potential .",
    "this may help us cope with the adverse effects of the rayleigh scattering of laser light @xcite , which tend to heat up the sample .",
    "we are grateful to the engineering and physical sciences research council uk ( epsrc ) , the german - israeli foundation ( gif ) , and the eu quacs and cqg networks for funding .",
