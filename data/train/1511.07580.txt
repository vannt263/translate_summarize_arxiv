    "an open question is whether the universe is or not a thermodynamical system .",

    "if the universe is not a thermodynamical entity , it is still an interesting problem to explore .",
    "if the universe admits a thermodynamical description , we must also speak of its physics on thermal equilibrium . but it seems very difficult to consider equilibrium and the possibility to attain it , for instance , between different present species ( under interaction or not ) . as we will see , an analogue situation is verified in hl cosmology when we think about bulk - boundary interaction .",
    "bulk - boundary interaction can lead to a new perspective for studying the cosmic evolution , and the hl cosmology @xcite provides a good scenario to develop it @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we analize the thermodynamical aspects for the aforementioned interaction where the emphasis will be focused on the thermal equilibrium , if exists , and the second law .",
    "a crucial point is to analize if the second law is satisfied or not in this cosmology ; an holographic philosophy will be used for modeling the energy density present at the bulk .",

    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we will discuss briefly some aspects of the function @xmath0 . in section iii , considering the framework of the hl cosmology ( flat case ) we discuss the bulk and boundary temperatures and the second law . in section iv",

    "v , we discuss the phase transitions experienced by the bulk and the boundary of the spacetime through the cosmic evolution .",
    "finally , section vi is devoted to conclusions .",
    "when two interacting fluids are considered , different ansatzes for @xmath0 ( this function measures the energy transference between both fluids ) can be seen in the literature , for instance , @xmath3where @xmath4 is a constant parameter to be determined by observations , and this @xmath0 does not experience any sign changes through the evolution @xcite .",
    "either way , the `` ansatz philosophy '' for the function @xmath0 , is a first approximation to describe the interaction according to the observational data @xcite . in the present work , we will use eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) as an example of interaction function between the bulk and boundary , and later the case of a @xmath0-function which exhibits sign changes .",
    "another approach , used here , is based on the holographic philosophy @xcite , where we can obtain an explicit form for @xmath0 after using some parametrization over @xmath5 ( equation of state parameter ) or @xmath6 ( deceleration parameter ) . for this case , it is possible to visualize sign changes in @xmath0 , a fact that is interesting if we are thinking , for instance , about eventual phase transitions experienced by the bulk or the boundary of the spacetime . in reference @xcite",
    "were found some phase transitions ( sign changes in the heat capacity ) experienced by two interacting fluids , dark energy under an holographic scheme and dark matter considered as a presureless fluid .",

    "the negativity of the sum extends somewhat towards the near future and then experiences a sign change as well as in the recent past , here we have used the function @xmath0 with one change of sign through the evolution .",
    "a similar behaviour can be observed when we consider a function @xmath0 with two sign changes or neither .",
    "so , according to fig .",
    "( [ fig : cero ] ) , the thermal equilibrium ( negativity of @xmath58 ) can be seen as a transient stage , at least , in the framework of the present discussion .",
    "nothing else can be said .",
    "it is difficult conceiving thermal equilibrium also , if , for instance we are thinking about the ( quantum ) concept of entanglement : bulk and boundary ( seen as two systems in interaction ) should reach the thermal equilibrium and , sooner or later , maintain it together with the growth of the entanglement entropy , but , if we look the ref . @xcite we can find that the aforementioned scheme has not been rigorously proven ( despite the list of evidences given there ) . by using the eqs .",
