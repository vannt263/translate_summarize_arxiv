    "an established way to identify nonclassicality of a quantum state is given by the features of the glauber - sudarshan @xmath0  representation  @xcite .",

    "although the @xmath0  function can not be measured directly in general , a filtered version of this quasiprobability has been introduced  @xcite and experimentally observed  @xcite .    beyond the mere identification , during the last years different attempts were made to quantify nonclassicality .",
    "one of the early approaches is based on the trace distance of a given quantum state to the set of all classical states  @xcite .",
    "analogously , a number of distance - based nonclassicality measures were proposed ",
    "e.g. , the bures distance  @xcite , or measures based on the hilbert - schmidt - norm  @xcite .",
    "an information science - based approach was formulated in terms of the fisher information  @xcite .",
    "other methods use the occurring negativities of the @xmath0  function . for example",
    ", the amount of gaussian noise which is necessary to remove the negativities of the @xmath0  function was proposed to quantify the nonclassicality  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a method to quantify the nonclassicality of a quantum state was defined by the potential of the state to generate entanglement  @xcite .",
    "this led from the quantification of nonclassicality to the quantification of entanglement , which is a similarly cumbersome problem .",
    "one possibility to quantify entanglement is the schmidt number  @xcite . among other attempts of entanglement quantification ,",
    "this measure is most closely related to the quantum superposition principle being the foundation of quantum correlations , cf .",
    ", e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "as the quantification of nonclassicality and of entanglement are similar problems , our idea will adapt the knowledge from entanglement quantification , to quantify the amount of nonclassicality .",
    "recently , the amount of nonclassicality for pure and mixed quantum states has been defined from two points of view : an operational and an algebraic one , denoted as degree of nonclassicality  @xcite .",
    "the algebraic amount of single mode nonclassicality has been shown to be identical to the amount of entanglement in the output ports of a beam splitter  @xcite .",
    "this measure is based on the decomposition of a quantum state in terms of superpositions of coherent states , which resemble the classical harmonic oscillator most closely  @xcite .",
    "the more superpositions of coherent states are required for the representation of the state under study , the more nonclassical quantum interferences are produced . for the notion of entanglement",

    "quantum superpositions induce quantum interferences and nonclassical correlations , which can be used as a resource for applications in quantum informations science .",
    "this is due to the fact that the degree of nonclassicality can be perfectly mapped to the same amount of entanglement in terms of the schmidt number .",
    "the set @xmath6 denotes the closure of all pure states with a number of superpositions less than , or equal to @xmath5 .",
    "we aim to give a general nonclassicality measure .",
