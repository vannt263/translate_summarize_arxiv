    "one of the main goals of the next generation of high energy colliders will be to probe the yang - mills sector of the standard model ( sm ) . in order to measure the @xmath3 and @xmath4 gauge couplings , the most promising production modes are @xmath5 and @xmath6 at hadron colliders and @xmath7 at @xmath8 linear colliders . with a high experimental accuracy",
    ", these modes would allow to test these couplings beyond tree level , which is essential for studying the gauge cancellations that arise at one - loop level .",
    "the study of these couplings also offers a unique opportunity to find any evidence of heavy physics lying beyond the fermi scale .",
    "in particular , the on - shell electromagnetic properties of the @xmath0 boson have been the subject of constant interest since they can be sensitive to new physics effects .",
    "these quantities are the anomalous ( one - loop ) magnetic dipole moment and the electric quadrupole moment , which are characterized by two parameters denoted by @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "they appear as coefficients of lorentz structures of canonical dimension 4 and 6 , respectively . in the sm ,",
    "both @xmath9 and @xmath10 vanish at tree level .",
    "this means that these parameters can only receive contributions at one - loop level in any renormalizable theory and may be sensitive to new physics effects , which might compete with the sm contribution .",
    "we will see below that a high precision measurement of @xmath10 can only be useful to looking for physics effects not very far beyond the fermi scale .",
    "in contrast , @xmath9 may be sensitive to heavy physics effects . within the sm ,",
    "the one - loop contributions to @xmath10 and @xmath9 from the gauge bosons , the higgs scalar and massless fermions were studied in @xcite , whereas the top quark effects were analyzed later @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of these quantities to new physics effects has also been studied within some specific models , like the two - higgs doublet model @xcite and supersymmetric theories @xcite .",
    "further studies were also done within models with an extra @xmath11 boson @xcite , composite particles @xcite , and an extra @xmath0 boson @xcite .",
    "both @xmath10 and @xmath9 have also been parametrized in a model independent way by using an effective lagrangian approach , and the phenomenological consequences have been extensively studied both at hadronic and leptonic colliders @xcite .    in this work",
    "we are interested in studying the on - shell @xmath3 vertex in the framework of the minimal @xmath12 model , which is based on the simplest nonabelian gauge - group extension of the sm , namely @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "in particular , we will concentrate on the contributions coming from a pair of singly and doubly charged gauge bosons predicted by this model .",
    "these particles are called bileptons because they have two units of lepton number .",
    "the 331 model has attracted considerable attention recently @xcite since it requires that the number of fermion families be a multiple of the quark color number in order to cancel anomalies , which offers a possible solution to the flavor problem .",
    "another important feature of this model is that the @xmath14 group is totally embedded in @xmath15 . as a consequence , after the first stage of spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) ,",
    "when @xmath16 is broken down to @xmath17 , there emerge a pair of massive bileptons in a doublet of the electroweak group , giving rise to very interesting couplings with the sm gauge bosons .",
    "in particular , these couplings do not involve any mixing angle , as occurs in other sm extensions , and are similar both in strength and lorentz structure to those couplings existing between the sm gauge bosons .    besides their nontrivial transformation properties under the electroweak gauge group , the bileptons get a mass splitting at the fermi scale due to the presence of some terms that violate the custodial @xmath18 symmetry .",
    "it is well known , from the analysis of fermion or scalar doublets , that these peculiarities might give rise to nondecoupling effects in low - energy processes .",
    "for this reason , it is important to investigate the respective contribution to @xmath19 and @xmath10 on the basis of the decoupling theorem @xcite .",
    "it is a known fact that a heavy particle might be detected through its virtual effects on low - energy physics if it evades the decoupling theorem @xcite .",
    "this interesting phenomenon can occur only in theories with ssb , where some particles can have a mass heavier than the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) scale due to a large coupling constant .",
    "in such a situation , the suppression factor arising from the propagator of the heavy particle is compensated by a mass factor appearing in the numerator , which in turn is determined by a large coupling constant .",
    "in contrast , a particle decouples in the heavy mass limit if its mass is induced by a gauge singlet bare parameter ( usually an unfixed vev ) since dynamics compensatory effects are not present in this case . in this paper we will show that bileptons obey the decoupling theorem and , as a consequence , their contribution to both @xmath19 and @xmath10 vanishes in the heavy mass limit .",
    "this behavior is a result of the fact that a large mass implies a large parameter not fixed by experiment , namely a vev larger than the electroweak scale .",
    "it is interesting to note that this case is similar to that studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which an extra scalar doublet that does not develop a vev was considered . on the other hand , the decoupling nature of @xmath10 is not surprising , even if it receives contributions from a particle that violates the decoupling theorem .",
    "it turns out that this quantity is insensitive to a large physical scale @xcite .",
    "this result is a consequence of the fact that @xmath10 is parametrized by a dimension-6 lorentz structure which is naturally suppressed by inverse powers of the mass of the heavy particle circulating in the loop , as was explicitly verified for the contribution of an extra fermion generation and technihadrons @xcite .",
    "we will return to this point later in the context of the bilepton contribution .",
    "in contrast to other extensions of the sm , in the @xmath12 model the mass of the extra gauge bosons is bounded from above as a consequence of matching the gauge coupling constants at the fermi scale @xcite .",
    "therefore this model would be either confirmed or ruled out at the future high - energy colliders .",
    "current bounds establish that bilepton masses may take values ranging from a few hundred of gevs to about 1 tev .",
    "this is an important reason to investigate the effect of these particles on the @xmath3 vertex",
    ". we will show below that the respective contributions to @xmath19 and @xmath10 are comparable to those induced by other weakly coupled renormalizable theories .",
    "another point worth to mention concerns the approach we took to perform our calculation . in the first place",
    ", we found convenient to use a nonlinear @xmath2 gauge rather than the unitary gauge .",
    "for this aim we introduced a gauge - fixing term covariant under the @xmath20 gauge group , from which the necessary feynman rules were derived .",
    "this gauge - fixing procedure allowed us to remove the mixed @xmath21 vertices .",
    "as for the evaluation of the tensorial integrals , it has been customary to use the feynman parameters technique for evaluating the static properties of elementary particles .",
    "it turns out that , in this case , the passarino - veltman reduction method @xcite breaks down since the gram determinant of the kinematic matrix vanishes @xcite .",
    "however , we will show below that , even in this case , the last method can be used after introducing some slight modifications .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we give a description of the minimal @xmath12 model .",
    "particular emphasis is given to the yang - mills sector . in sec .",
    "[ calculation ] we present the calculation of the static properties of the @xmath0 boson .",
    "[ discussion ] is devoted to discuss our results , and the conclusions are presented in sec . [ remarks ] .",
    "finally , explicit expressions for both the trilinear and quartic vertices involving bilepton gauge bosons are presented in the appendices , together with the respective feynman rules .",
    "to begin with , we present a short description of the fermionic sector of the minimal @xmath12 model .",
    "we will turn next to discuss in detail the gauge sector .",
    "in particular , we will focus on the mass spectrum and the coupling structure of the yang - mills sector .",
    "hereafter , we will follow closely the notation and conventions of ref . @xcite .",
    "the simplest anomaly - free fermionic content of the 331 model accommodates the leptons as antitriplets of @xmath15 :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the generation index .",
    "the quark sector includes three new exotic quarks .",
    "two quark generations are given the same representation , and the third one ( no matter what ) is treated differently .",
    "it has been customary to represent the first two quark families as triplets and the third one as antitriplet @xcite :    @xmath24    @xmath25    @xmath26    @xmath27    in order to accomplish the gauge hierarchy and the fermion masses , a higgs sector composed of several @xmath15 multiplets is required : to break @xmath16 down to @xmath17 only one @xmath15 scalar triplet is necessary ; the next stage of ssb , @xmath28 , requires two scalar @xmath15 triplets and one sextet .",
    "the minimal higgs sector has the following quantum numbers    @xmath29    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is a @xmath32 matrix given by    @xmath33    both @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) are two - component complex quantities .",
    "we will see below that after the first stage of ssb all these quantities constitute a specific representation of the electroweak group .",
    "when @xmath38 develops a vev , @xmath16 breaks down to @xmath17 and the exotic quarks and the new gauge bosons acquire masses .",
    "the remaining multiplets endow the sm particles with mass .",
    "the covariant derivative in the fundamental representation of @xmath16 can be written as    @xmath39    with @xmath40 the gell - man matrices and @xmath41 .",
    "the generators are normalized according to @xmath42 , which means that @xmath43 . the first stage of ssb is accomplished by the vev of @xmath38 , @xmath44 , according to the following scheme : six generators are broken , namely @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) , whereas the remaining ones leave invariant the vacuum , namely @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) . notice that @xmath49 , so the hypercharge can be identified with a linear combination of broken generators as follows @xmath50 . at this stage of ssb",
    ", there appears one pair of singly and doubly charged bileptons , which are defined by    @xmath51    and get a mass given by    @xmath52    according to the quantum number assignment , the bilepton gauge bosons fill out one doublet of @xmath53 with hypercharge @xmath54 :    @xmath55    the gauge fields @xmath56 and @xmath57 mix to produce a massive field , @xmath58 , and a massless gauge boson , @xmath59 .",
    "the latter is associated with the @xmath60 group .",
    "these fields are given by    @xmath61    where @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the coupling constant associated with the hypercharge group is given by @xmath64 .",
    "the remaining fields associated with the unbroken generators of @xmath15 are the gauge bosons of the @xmath14 group , which will be denoted as @xmath65 ( @xmath23 ) .    in the higgs sector ,",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 ( @xmath66 ) are @xmath14 doublets with hypercharge @xmath54 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "it can be shown that the two components of @xmath34 represent the pseudo - goldstone bosons associated with the bilepton fields , while the real and imaginary part of @xmath68 correspond to a physical higgs boson and the pseudo - goldstone boson associated with the @xmath11 field , respectively .",
    "the third components of @xmath69 and @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , are singlets of @xmath14 with hypercharge @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "the sextet @xmath75 is composed of the following structures : a doublet @xmath76 with @xmath77 , a triplet @xmath31 with @xmath78 , and a singlet @xmath79 with @xmath80 . as for the fermionic sector , in addition to the sm content of leptons and quarks , there appear three exotic quarks as singlets of @xmath14 . among these exotic quarks ,",
    "two of them have electric charge @xmath81 , while the third one has electric charge @xmath82 .    in summary , after the first stage of ssb we end up with the @xmath83   gauge group and the sm content of leptons and quarks , plus three doublets and one triplet of scalar fields , one bilepton doublet , one neutral gauge boson ( @xmath11 ) , and several singlets of scalar and quark fields .",
    "the presence of a bilepton doublet is a remarkable feature of this class of models and may give rise to some interesting phenomenological consequences .",
    "the main aim of this work is to explore the effects of these exotic particles on the static electromagnetic properties of the @xmath0 gauge boson .",
    "the respective contributions to the @xmath3 vertex are dictated entirely by the yang - mills sector of the model .",
    "it is interesting to note that the exotic quarks do not contribute to the @xmath3 vertex since they are @xmath14 singlets and thus do not interact with the @xmath0 boson .",
    "moreover , we will not consider the contributions from charged scalar higgs boson as such kind of contributions have been studied widely within the two higgs doublet model @xcite .",
    "therefore , our main concern lies on the structure of the yang - mills sector associated with the @xmath16 group .",
    "the analysis of the higgs kinetic - energy terms is also required since this sector is responsible for the splitting between the bilepton masses . as it will be discussed below , such a splitting is a consequence of the violation of the custodial @xmath18 symmetry .",
    "in addition , this sector requires some manipulation as we found convenient to use a renormalizable @xmath2 gauge for our calculation .",
    "the full yang - mills lagrangian is composed of the following three @xmath17 invariant pieces    @xmath84    where @xmath85 is the sm yang - mills lagrangian given by    @xmath86    @xmath87 , which comprises the interactions between the sm gauge bosons and the new ones , can be written as    @xmath88\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we have introduced the definitions @xmath89 and @xmath90/2 .",
    "in addition @xmath91 is the covariant derivative associated with the electroweak group .",
    "such a lagrangian induces new couplings , which possess a rich structure , between the sm gauge bosons and the bileptons .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath92 vertex is not induced .",
    "in particular , the trilinear vertices @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and the quartic one @xmath95 , induce one - loop anomalous contributions to the electromagnetic static properties of the @xmath0 boson .",
    "the trilinear couplings were previously studied in @xcite .",
    "we take one step forward and present the complete expressions for both the trilinear and the quartic vertices in appendix [ appendixi ] .",
    "finally , the term @xmath96 induces interactions between the @xmath11 boson and the bileptons :    @xmath97    at the fermi scale the bileptons and the @xmath11 boson receive additional mass contributions from the vev of the @xmath14 doublet @xmath98 ( @xmath66 ) . by simplicity",
    "we are assuming that @xmath99 .",
    "the extra mass terms for the bileptons arise from the higgs kinetic - energy sector and are given by    @xmath100.\\ ] ]    notice that these terms violate the custodial @xmath101 symmetry .",
    "therefore , the bilepton masses are now given by    @xmath102    as for the @xmath0 boson , it gains a mass given by    @xmath103    from these expressions , the following bound on the splitting between the squared bilepton masses can be derived @xcite    @xmath104    some remarks concerning the decoupling theorem and the custodial symmetry are in order .",
    "first of all , note that the bilepton masses depend essentially on the coupling constant @xmath105 , the fermi scale @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",
    "since @xmath105 and @xmath108 are fixed by experiment , the only way in which the bileptons can become very heavy is through a large @xmath107",
    ". we will discuss below that this fact is crucial in order for the bileptons to respect the decoupling theorem . on the other hand ,",
    "the mass splitting arises from the term that violates the custodial @xmath18 symmetry . as an immediate consequence ,",
    "there are bilepton contributions to the @xmath109 oblique parameters arising from the mass splitting @xcite . as it will be seen below ,",
    "both @xmath9 and @xmath10 also depend on this quantity , though the dependence is somewhat different . in the large mass limit ( @xmath110 )",
    "the custodial symmetry is restored , i.e. @xmath111 .",
    "we can now specify the theory by defining a supplementary condition .",
    "since we are interested in studying the loop contributions to the on - shell @xmath3 vertex arising from bileptons , it is only necessary to define a gauge - fixing procedure for these fields .",
    "although a calculation within the unitary gauge requires only those vertices which arise from @xmath112 , for computational matters we found convenient to work in the framework of a renormalizable @xmath2 gauge , which requires the introduction of scalar fields ( pseudo - goldstone bosons and faddeev - popov ghosts ) . we will define a gauge which is covariant under the electromagnetic @xmath20 group by means of gauge - fixing functions which transform covariantly under this group @xcite .",
    "we summarize the respective gauge - fixing procedure , together with the feynman rules necessary for our calculation in appendix [ appendixii ] .",

    ", it is straightforward to obtain the amplitude corresponding to each one of the diagrams contributing to the static properties of the @xmath0 boson .",
    "we have used a slightly modified version of the reduction scheme of passarino and veltman to express our result in terms of scalar functions @xcite . to illustrate our calculation scheme ,",
    "let us consider the triangle diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - wwgfd ] ( a ) : the one which involves the @xmath124 coupling but now with the bilepton gauge bosons replaced with their respective pseudo - goldstone boson . from now on this diagram will be referred to as @xmath125 .",

    "we have dropped any term that does not contribute to the static properties of the @xmath0 boson .",
    "in addition , we have used the mass - shell and transversality conditions for the gauge bosons , which means that we can make the following replacements everywhere : @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "as it will be evident below , the condition @xmath132 was only used at the final stage of the calculation .",
    "the amplitude @xmath133 can be put in the form of eq .",
    "( [ wwg ] ) by means of the feynman parameters technique .",
    "one more alternative is to use the passarino - veltman method to reduce the tensor integrals down to scalar functions .",

    "another very stringent bound , namely @xmath195 gev , arises from fermion pair production and lepton - flavor violating processes @xcite .",

    "we will discuss below that the mass splitting bound has very important consequences which are closely related to the decoupling theorem .",
    "we are now ready to discuss our results . in the preceding section we have presented explicit expressions , ready for their numerical evaluation , of the bilepton contribution to the static properties of the @xmath0 boson in the minimal 331 model . to begin with",
    ", it is worth analyzing the behavior of the @xmath10 and @xmath9 parameters as functions of both the singly and doubly charged gauge boson masses .",
    "the @xmath10 parameter is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - deltaqa ] , whereas fig .",
    "[ fig - deltaka ] shows the @xmath9 parameter . for the purpose of comparison with results derived within other models , the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - deltaqa ] and fig .",
    "[ fig - deltaka ] are given in units of @xmath200 , which has been widely used in the literature@xcite .",
    "we are using the scaled variables @xmath170 , @xmath171 , and @xmath201 , defined in the last section .",
    "it is not surprising that the maximum contribution from the bilepton gauge bosons to @xmath10 is of the order of @xmath202 , while the maximum value of @xmath9 is of the order of @xmath203 .",
    "these values are of the same order of magnitude as those arising from other weakly coupled renormalizable theories , such as the two - higgs doublet model @xcite , supersymmetric theories @xcite , etc .",
    "as far as the sm contributions are concerned , @xmath204 and @xmath205 , for a higgs boson mass of the order of 100 gev @xcite . in the 331 model",
    ", the maximum value of @xmath10 is reached when the bilepton gauge boson masses are degenerate and acquire their lowest allowed values . in the case of @xmath206 ,",
    "its maximum value is obtained for the lightest allowed singly charged bilepton and the maximum allowed splitting .",
    "both @xmath10 and @xmath9 decrease rapidly as the bilepton masses increase simultaneously , as expected from the decoupling theorem",
    ". we will argue below that the validity of the decoupling theorem is , in this case , a little more involved than usual .",
    "if the 331 model is realized in nature , there is no compelling reason to expect that the bilepton masses are exactly degenerate .",
    "however , in the case of a very heavy bilepton , with a mass of the order of 1 tev , the bilepton masses are indeed almost degenerate ( for instance , when @xmath207 tev the maximum splitting allows for @xmath208 gev ) . therefore ,",
    "in the heavy mass limit the bilepton masses become exactly degenerate and the custodial @xmath18 symmetry is also exact , which also means that in this limit the bilepton contribution to the oblique parameter @xmath31 vanishes @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig - decoupling ] we show the static properties of the @xmath0 boson , as a function of @xmath170 , when the bilepton masses are degenerate . in this scenario , both @xmath209 and @xmath9 decouple from low - energy physics when the bilepton mass is very heavy , in accordance with the decoupling theorem .",
    "it is interesting to analyze further this point .",
    "the bilepton gauge bosons acquire masses from the vev of @xmath34 , when the @xmath210   gauge group is broken down to the @xmath83   gauge group . at this stage of ssb ,",
    "the bilepton gauge boson masses are degenerate [ see eq .",
    "( [ ymass1 ] ) ] . the subsequent breaking of the @xmath83   gauge group , through the vevs of the @xmath211 doublets , induces the splitting @xmath201 between the bilepton masses [ see eq .",
    "( [ ymass1a ] ) ] , thereby breaking the custodial @xmath18 symmetry .",
    "since the sm gauge boson also get their masses at this stage , @xmath201 can not become arbitrarily large and is bounded from above .",
    "in fact , a heavy bilepton mass implies a large vev of @xmath34 , which is not fixed by experiment .",
    "so , we can not have a scenario where the mass of one bilepton becomes large while the mass of the other one remains small .",
    "this fact is crucial for the validity of the decoupling theorem . at this point",
    "we would like to compare the bilepton case with that of a sm - like fermion doublet , which is known to give rise to nondecoupling effects when there is a large splitting between the masses of the fermion doublet components @xcite .",
    "for this purpose , let us consider the contribution from a hypothetical sm - like fourth fermion family , with quarks @xmath212 and @xmath213 , to the oblique parameters .",
    "of course , the same analysis applies to a doublet composed of a heavy lepton and a massive neutrino @xcite . in this case , the fermion masses arise from independent yukawa couplings and a heavy mass involves a large yukawa coupling . in principle , there is no theoretical restriction for having a splitting @xmath214 arbitrarily large , though low - energy data do impose restrictions on it @xcite . to clarify our point ,",
    "let us consider the fermion contribution to the @xmath31 oblique parameter :    @xmath215    which clearly vanishes when @xmath216 .",
    "let us now assume that we can make @xmath217 large while @xmath218 is held fixed . in the limit @xmath219 we get @xmath220 .",
    "it is thus evident that the decoupling theorem breaks down , which is not surprising since the heavy mass limit implies a large yukawa coupling .",
    "let us now consider the contribution from the bilepton gauge bosons to the oblique @xmath31 parameter , which actually has the same mass dependence as in the fermion case , i.e. @xmath221 @xcite . at first sight",
    "one might think that the bilepton gauge bosons would also give rise to nondecoupling effects . however , the splitting between the bilepton masses is now bounded from above : @xmath222 , which in the heavy mass limit becomes @xmath223 . therefore",
    ", writing @xmath224 and expanding the @xmath31 parameter in powers of @xmath225 , we have in the limit of large bilepton masses    @xmath226    it is thus clear that in this case the decoupling theorem remains valid , although there is the same mass dependence as in the fermion case . as in this limit",
    "the bileptons become almost degenerate , the custodial @xmath18 symmetry becomes almost exact .",
    "it is important to notice that the bilepton gauge boson contribution to the @xmath227 parameter also vanishes in the limit of exact degeneracy since @xmath228@xcite .",
    "now let us go back to the static properties of the @xmath0 boson .",
    "it turns out that a similar analysis as the one already presented can be done for @xmath10 and @xmath9 , though in this case there is a more intricate mass dependence , which makes the analysis less transparent [ see eqs .",
    "( [ deltaqgen])-([f2keq ] ) ] . in the heavy mass limit",
    "we have @xmath229 , which yields eqs .",
    "( [ deltaqdeg ] ) and ( [ deltakdeg ] ) . in this case , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - decoupling ] , both @xmath10 and @xmath9 vanish for a large bilepton mass : i.e. they are insensitive to a heavy bilepton .",
    "in fact , from eqs .",
    "( [ deltaqdeg ] ) and ( [ deltakdeg ] ) we get when @xmath229    @xmath230    which manifestly decouples from low - energy physics .",
    "we would like now to explore the hypothetical situation in which a large mass splitting is allowed .",
    "it turns out that if we make @xmath171 large while @xmath170 is kept fixed , @xmath10 vanishes , whereas @xmath9 tends to a constant value .",
    "this scenario is depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig - deltaqc ] and [ fig - deltakc ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig - deltaqc ] , @xmath10 is shown as a function of the doubly charged bilepton mass , for diverse values of the singly charged bilepton mass .",
    "it is evident that @xmath10 would decouple if @xmath198 would become heavy while @xmath231 remains fixed . on the other hand ,",
    "[ fig - deltakc ] shows a similar plot for @xmath9 , which makes also evident that this parameter would be sensitive to nondecoupling effects if the doubly charged bilepton mass would become much heavier than the singly charged bilepton mass .",
    "although the situation illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig - deltaqc ] and [ fig - deltakc ] is unrealistic within the 331 model , which forbids a mass splitting larger than the electroweak scale , the previous analysis is useful to clarify the following point : even in the scenario in which @xmath9 is sensitive to nondecoupling effects of a heavy particle , @xmath10 is insensitive to such effects .",
    "this fact was noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was explicitly verified that the contributions to @xmath10 from an extra fermion doublet and technihadrons as well do decouple in the heavy mass limit @xcite .",
    "finally , we would like to stress that the main difference with a sm - like fermion doublet is that both components of the bilepton doublet of the 331 model get a heavy mass from a large vev ( @xmath107 ) , which is heavier than the electroweak scale . on the other hand",
    ", the splitting between the bilepton masses lies in the electroweak scale since it arises from vevs which break the @xmath83   gauge group down to @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , these vevs also give masses to the sm gauge bosons .",
    "in the case of the sm - like fermion doublet , its components acquire their masses from yukawa couplings . in summary , in the case of the bileptons , a heavy mass implies a large vev but not a large coupling , whereas in the fermion case a large mass does implies a large coupling .",
    "the bilepton case has a close resemblance with the one discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , concerning a scalar doublet which acquires mass from a bare parameter .",
    "we have presented a detailed study of the bilepton gauge boson contributions to the static properties of the @xmath0 boson .",
    "we have presented explicit expressions for @xmath10 and @xmath9 in terms of elementary functions .",
    "we found that both @xmath10 and @xmath9 are of the same order of magnitude as those contributions from other weakly coupled renormalizable theories , like supersymmetric theories and the two - higgs doublet model .",
    "an important consequence of this result is that , unless an overoptimistic precision is achieved in the future measurements of the anomalous moments of the @xmath0 boson , it would be extremely difficult to unravel the source of any possible deviation from the sm , if such a deviation is detected indeed and arises from a weakly coupled renormalizable theory .",
    "in the course of the last section , particular emphasis was given to the decoupling properties of the bilepton gauge bosons .",
    "we have found that the bilepton contribution to the static properties of the @xmath0 boson decouples from low - energy physics as both the singly and the doubly charged gauge boson masses become heavy .",
    "there is a hypothetical scenario which might give rise to nondecoupling effects , but it is unrealistic as involves a large mass splitting ( larger than the electroweak scale ) , which is not allowed in the 331 model since such a splitting is induced by the electroweak scale . in this context , the bileptonic contribution has a close resemblance with the contribution from a sm - like fermion doublet or a scalar doublet .",
    "in fact , the contribution from some feynman diagrams involving bileptons has the same mass dependence as that derived from the feynman diagrams involving fermions or scalar bosons .",
    "the main difference is that a large fermion mass comes from a large yukawa coupling , while a large bilepton mass requires a large vev .",
    "it has been argued that the last case does not give rise to nondecoupling effects .    finally , as a by - product of our calculation",
