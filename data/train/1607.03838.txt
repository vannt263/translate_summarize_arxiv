    ": 2,965,010programming language : c++ computer : pcs and workstations operating system : linux ram : depends on problem size , but should not challenge modern computers .",
    "around 5 mb for the parameters in sample input files .",
    "classification : 11.2 , 17.8 , 2.5 external routines : pythia 8.2 and dpmjet 3.0 are needed for some final states .",
    "nature of problem : the cross - section for ultra - peripheral collisions is obtained by integrating the photon fluxes in transverse impact parameter space , subject to the requirement ( which is also impact parameter dependent ) that the colliding nuclei do not interact hadronically .",
    "the program is a two step process .",
    "first , it calculates the cross - sections for the reaction of interest , as a function of @xmath0 ( photon - pomeron or two - photon center of mass energy ) , @xmath1 ( final state rapidity ) and @xmath2 ( final state transverse momentum ) .",
    "second , starlight generates monte carlo events which can be used to determine cross - sections within specific kinematic constraints or for studies of detector efficiencies .",
    "the second step includes the decay of any unstable particles produced in the reaction , with appropriate consideration of particle spins and parity .",
    "it outputs these events in ascii format .",
    "solution method : the program generates a two dimensional look - up table of the production cross - section as a function of final state rapidity and mass . the dimensions of the table are selectable , allowing the user to choose the desired accuracy . for certain final states , a second two - dimensional look - up table , giving the transverse momentum distribution , as a function of rapidity , is also used . with these look - up tables ,",
    "the program generates final states .",
    "particle decays and the final angular distributions are calculated for each event .",
    "restrictions : the program is focused on ultra - relativistic collisions at brookhaven s rhic ( relativistic heavy ion collider ) and cern s lhc ( large hadron collider ) , with final states that are visible in a central detector . at lower energies ( i.e. at the cern sps ) , caution should be exercised because starlight does not account for the longitudinal momentum transfer to the nucleus ; this is larger at low beam energies . running time : the running time depends on the binning used for the look - up tables and the number of events requested .",
    "table generation is typically less than 15 minutes on a single core , and event generation is quick  generating 100,000 events takes only a few minutes .",
    "running the provided sample input file to produce 1,000 rho mesons at rhic energies takes @xmath37 minutes ; running the provided sample input file to produce 1,000 electron - positron pairs at rhic energies takes @xmath32 minutes .",

    "ultra - peripheral collisions ( upcs ) @xcite are an active field of study at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory @xcite , at the fermilab tevatron @xcite and at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite . in upcs , the two nuclei interact electromagnetically rather than hadronically by physically missing each other .",
    "two - photon and photonuclear interactions can occur .",
    "starlight is capable of simulating a range of two - photon and photonuclear interactions : two - photon production of single mesons and photoproduction of a variety of vector mesons .",
    "it can also interface with the dpmjet iii event generator to generate general photonuclear interactions .",
    "short - lived mesons ( including vector mesons ) are usually decayed within starlight and take into account the spin state . for more complex cases , such as mesons with multiple final states ,",
    "pythia is used for the decays , but the spin information is lost .",
    "in ultra - peripheral collisions , two types of interactions can be distinguished : purely electromagnetic , usually referred to as two - photon interactions , or photonuclear .",
    "in a two - photon interaction , the two electromagnetic fields , carried by the two nuclei , collide .",
    "these fields couple to any particles that carry charge , so a wide variety of final states are possible . for relativistic nuclei ,",
    "the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular , and the configuration may be represented as a flux of almost - real photons , following the weizscker - williams method . at an impact parameter @xmath4 from a relativistic nucleus with charge @xmath5 and lorentz boost @xmath6 , the photon number density is @xcite @xmath7 \\label{eq : fflux}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the photon energy , @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the electromagnetic fine structure constant and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are modified bessel functions .",
    "the output @xmath13 is the number of photons per unit area , per unit energy .",
    "the first term gives the flux of transversely polarized photons ; it dominates for relativistic nuclei , and it is the only one considered further here .",
    "as long as the ions are moderately relativistic , the second term is unimportant .    through these two - photon interactions ,",
    "pairs of leptons , quarks or electroweak bosons may be produced . if a quark pair is produced , they hadronize into a single meson ( with the appropriate spin / parity ) , a meson pair or a more complex final state .",
    "the cross - section depends on the overlap of the two photon fields and on the two - photon coupling to the final state .",
    "starlight can generate a number of single - meson and lepton pair final states .    in photonuclear interactions ,",
    "the most common exclusive final state is a vector meson . in the vector meson dominance picture",
    ", photons fluctuate to @xmath14 pairs , which scatter elastically from the target nucleus . for heavy nuclear targets , the amplitudes for scattering from individual nucleons add coherently when the @xmath15momentum transfer @xmath16 is small ( @xmath17 ) , leading to a large cross - section .",
    "the treatment of coherence is handled via a glauber formalism which accounts for multiple interactions within the nucleus @xcite .",
    "starlight also simulates photon scattering at higher @xmath2 , where the amplitudes from the multiple target nucleons add incoherently .    in photonuclear upcs ,",
    "either nucleus can emit the photon , with the other nucleus serving as a target .",
    "these possibilities are indistinguishable .",
    "exchanging the photon emitter and target introduces a propagator @xmath18 to account for the position difference . here",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 are the photon and impact parameter vectors @xcite . for symmetric collisions ( e.g. proton - proton or gold - gold )",
    ", swapping the nucleus is equivalent to a parity transformation .",
    "vector mesons are negative parity , so the amplitudes subtract and , for @xmath21 , vector meson production disappears . for proton - antiproton collisions , swapping the nuclei",
    "is a charge - parity transformation ; since vector mesons are cp positive , the two amplitudes add @xcite .",
    "one important aspect of ultra - peripheral collisions is that , at least for heavy - ions , multiple interactions are possible between a single ion pair .",
    "this has important consequences ; it allows for studies involving correlations among the multiple final state particles .",
    "for example , one can study the azimuthal angular correlations between the neutrons emitted in mutual coulomb dissociation @xcite or rapidity correlations for states like @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "experimentally , upcs accompanied by single or multiple coulomb excitation have proven to be very important .",
    "the nuclear decays produce neutrons which are easily visible in zero degree calorimeters , greatly simplifying triggering .",
    "many experimental results to - date have relied on these neutrons for triggering . because of the kinematics of the photon emission and absorption @xcite , to a large degree , each photon acts independently , and the cross - section for multiple reactions is given by @xmath23 where the @xmath24 are the probabilities for the different subreactions , as a function of impact parameter .",
    "these probabilities may be substantial ; a unitarization procedure corrects for the possibilities of multiple subreactions , such as the production of two @xmath25 pairs .",
    "starlight can calculate cross - sections and generate events for two - photon and photonuclear interactions accompanied by mutual coulomb excitation .",
    "these are three or four photon interactions : one or two for the photonuclear or two - photon interaction , plus one to excite each nucleus .",
    "it can also calculate the cross - sections for reactions accompanied by mutual excitation to a giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) interactions ; the gdr excitations usually decay by single neutron emission .",
    "starlight can simulate the collision of two dissimilar nuclei ; both @xmath5 and @xmath26 are selectable by the user .",
    "heavy nuclei are modeled either as hard spheres , or following the woods - saxon mass distribution . for selected nuclei ( gold , lead , copper ) , starlight uses measured parameters for the nuclear radius @xcite . otherwise , the woods - saxon radius is set to @xmath27 .",
    "a skin depth of 0.53 fm is used for all nuclei . for light nuclei , with @xmath28 , a gaussian mass distribution is used .",
    "each projectile beam energy are defined by the lorentz factor @xmath6 set by the user .",
    "the input beam energies can be asymmetric for the two projectiles , but internally all calculations are performed in the center of mass frame . before the output is written , the final state particles are boosted to the laboratory frame specified by the user .",
    "starlight is optimized for rhic and lhc energies , although other energy ranges should be usable .",
    "starlight 2.2 should closely reproduce the calculations in the original publications  @xcite , with the following exceptions .",
    "first , for some nuclei , the nuclear radii are set to the measured values , while previously a parameterization assuming @xmath29 was always used ; this new radius is used exclusively .",
    "this reduces the cross - section for gold beams by about 7% , but has almost no effect for lead beams .",
    "second , the parameterizations of the @xmath30 and @xmath31 cross - sections have been improved , as described below .",
    "the photon spectrum is calculated in impact parameter space by integrating eq .",
    "[ eq : fflux ] over all impact parameters under the assumption that the beam projectiles do not interact . for photonuclear interactions , the flux is @xmath32 and for two - photon interactions , @xmath33 here , @xmath34 is the photon density for photons with energy @xmath35 at position @xmath36 from nucleus 1 and @xmath37 is the corresponding density from nucleus 2 . the vectors @xmath36 and @xmath38 have their origins at the center of each nucleus .",
    "so , @xmath39 is the impact parameter between the two nuclei .",
    "the requirement that there be no hadronic interactions reduces the usable luminosity .",
    "the actual cross - section is sensitive to how this non - interaction is defined @xcite .",
    "the probability of not having a hadronic interaction at impact parameter @xmath4 , @xmath40 , is implemented in different ways for nucleus - nucleus , proton - nucleus and proton - proton collisions .",
    "starlight uses a trick to lower the dimensionality of the integral in eq .",
    "[ eq : gglum ] .",
    "the integral @xmath41 is replaced with @xmath42 where @xmath43  @xcite .    in nucleus - nucleus collisions ,",
    "the probability to have no hadronic interaction at impact parameter @xmath4 is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the nuclear overlap function , which is calculated from the nuclear density profiles .",
    "the nuclear densities are assumed to follow a woods - saxon distribution , and the nucleon - nucleon interaction cross - sections follow the particle data group parameterization for @xmath46 collisions for proton - proton center of mass energies @xmath47 above 7 gev @xcite : @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "the use of @xmath50 reduces the @xmath51 luminosities by up to 20% compared to the simpler requirement that @xmath52 @xcite , because there is still a substantial probability of two nuclei interacting hadronically at impact parameters larger than @xmath53 .    in proton - nucleus collisions ,",
    "the hadronic interaction probability is also calculated from the glauber model .",
    "the probability of having no hadronic interactions is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the nuclear thickness function . for large nuclei , applying this probability function is roughly equivalent to requiring @xmath56 .",
    "this probability is used whether the photon is emitted by the nucleus or the proton .",
    "so , the effective photon flux from the proton in a proton - nucleus collision is considerably smaller than if the flux is calculated from just the proton form factor @xcite .    in proton - proton collisions the probability of having no hadronic interactions is calculated from @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the fourier transform of the pp elastic scattering amplitude @xcite .",
    "this is modeled by an exponential @xmath59 with @xmath60  gev@xmath61 .",
    "this interaction probability corresponds roughly to a cut in minimum impact parameter of @xmath62  fm .",
    "the nuclear form factor is the convolution of a hard - sphere form factor with a yukawa potential with a range of 0.7 fm .",
    "this is very close to the the woods - saxon distribution , and the form factor may be determined analytically @xcite . for a 4-momentum transfer @xmath16 , @xmath63 \\big[\\frac{1}{1+a^2q^2}\\big ] .",

    "proton - proton and proton - nucleus collisions are treated separately , as discussed below , with the dipole form factor for the proton @xcite @xmath65",
    "the two photon energies , @xmath35 and @xmath66 , are related to the final state invariant mass w and rapidity y through @xmath67 and @xmath68 the two - photon luminosity @xmath69 in eq .",
    "[ eq : gglum ] can thus be transformed to @xmath70 . for two - photon interactions , the cross - section to produce a final state @xmath71 factorizes into a two - photon cross - section and a two - photon luminosity @xcite : @xmath72    the limits on @xmath73 ( a symmetric region",

    "the final state transverse momentum @xmath2 is the vector sum of the @xmath2 of the two photons .",
    "the @xmath2 distribution of the photons depends on the nuclear form factor @xcite as defined by @xmath75 because the @xmath2 distribution depends on the photon energy , it can not be pre - calculated for every condition . for simplicity , starlight determines the photon @xmath2 using rejection sampling . the azimuthal angle in the transverse plane is assumed to be uniformly distributed .",
    "three types of two - photon interactions are implemented currently : two - photon production of lepton pairs , single meson production and decay , and the reaction @xmath76 , followed by @xmath77 decays .",
    "starlight creates lepton pairs using the equivalent photon approximation ( epa ) approach .",
    "this is a lowest order calculation , where the photons are treated as massless .",
    "the kinematic distributions are in generally good agreement with the data , except that the epa approach finds a lower average @xmath2 than in the data . a full quantum electrodynamic calculation , including the photon virtuality , found better agreement with the data @xcite .",
    "later calculations showed that the star result includes room for an additional contribution to the cross - section , due to higher order corrections @xcite .",
    "these corrections are expected , but their effects on the kinematic distributions are not well known . still , starlight lepton pairs are useful for most purposes .",

    "the angular distribution of these lepton pairs is given by @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the angle between the beam direction and one of the leptons , in the lepton - lepton center of mass frame .",
    "here , we neglect the effect of the photon @xmath2 on the angular distribution .",
    "all three leptons are treated as stable ; @xmath84 ( and , if desired , @xmath85 ) decays must be handled externally .",
