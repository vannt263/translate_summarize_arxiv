    "it is believed that the regge pole model could be an effective theory for high - energy hadron reactions induced by electromagnetic and mesonic probes @xcite .",
    "the regge models formulated in the @xmath4-channel helicity amplitude ( scha ) @xcite are favorable to the analysis of photoproduction of pseudoscalar meson since they share essentially the same production amplitude with that of the effective lagrangian approach except for the simple _ reggeization _ of the @xmath5-channel meson poles @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , advantageous to work with the regge poles in the scha in that one exploits the effective lagrangians to estimate the coupling constants of the exchanged meson from the decay width or from the symmetry consideration .",
    "the application of these models to physical processes is , however , limited by the large ambiguity in the coupling of meson trajectory due to the fitting of the experimental data with few meson exchanges . within the framework of the @xmath6 regge poles for kaon photoproduction , to be specific ,",
    "the coupling constants of the @xmath7 to baryons were given too large as compared to those either from the su(3 ) symmetry prediction @xcite or from other independent process such as the nijmegen soft core potential for the nn interaction @xcite .",
    "this large discrepancy , as shown in table [ cc1 ] below , demonstrates that the @xmath6 exchanges in current models are not enough to describe the process up to @xmath8 gev@xmath9 . in this work",
    "we study the processes @xmath10 and @xmath11 at forward angles within the regge framework and discuss the possibility of the model prediction without fit parameters for the meson - baryon couplings . from our previous analysis of the pion photoproduction @xcite",
    ", we recall , the inclusion of the tensor meson @xmath12 exchange in the @xmath13 regge poles led us to choose a rather moderate value for the @xmath14-meson coupling constants for the better description of the experimental data .",

    "it is , then , natural to extend the model of @xmath6 exchanges to obtain the parameter - free prediction for the production mechanism by introducing the tensor meson @xmath2 .",

    "+ according to the duality expressed as the finite energy sum rule between the @xmath4-channel resonances and the @xmath5-channel regge poles @xcite , @xmath30 that the imaginary part of the resonance amplitude does not vanish by the optical theorem in the left hand side of eq.([fesr ] ) is in effect equivalent to imply @xmath31 , @xmath32 , in the right hand side , i.e. , the violation of the exchange degeneracy ( exd ) by the different residues between the @xmath7 and @xmath2 in the leading @xmath7 trajectory @xcite .",
    "this proves that the weak exd of the pair @xmath7-@xmath2 is a good approximation , and hence , both the two contribute independently with the different residues ( different coupling vertices in the present scheme ) , but share the same phase of the signature factor with each other .",
    "thus , we use the @xmath2 regge pole of the spin-2 @xmath33 with the rotating phase for the nonzero imaginary part of the amplitude . here the trajectory @xmath34 is taken for the @xmath2 with the slope the same as that of the @xmath7 @xcite and the scale factor @xmath35 is chosen as @xmath36 gev@xmath9 .    avoiding fit parameters for the coupling constants of all exchanged mesons considered here we use the su(3 ) relations to determine their values .",
    "we begin with the estimate of the @xmath37 coupling , while the relatively well - established coupling constant @xmath38 and radiative decay constant @xmath39 are taken the same as those in ref .",
    "@xcite for comparison .",
    "we estimate the coupling constants of the vector meson @xmath40 by using the su(3 ) relations in which case @xmath41 is taken from the universality of @xmath14 meson coupling with the ratio @xmath42 . for the tensor coupling of the @xmath14 meson , @xmath43 , we use @xmath44 with the ratio @xmath45 from the su(6 )",

    "the decay width corresponding to the @xmath48 vertex in eq.([tensor ] ) is given by @xcite @xmath49 from which @xmath50 is obtained .",
    "since there are no informations currently available for the @xmath51 couplings except for those @xmath52 and @xmath53 , we resume the su(3 ) symmetry for the tensor meson nonet coupling to baryons where the @xmath54 coupling constants are given by @xmath55 and estimate the @xmath51 coupling constants from the knowledge of the @xmath52 couplings in existing estimates . in order for the above su(3 ) predictions to be reliable",
