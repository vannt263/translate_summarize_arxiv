    "the  column density distribution of intergalactic gas clouds , @xmath0 , is determined at high redshifts through the analysis of qso absorption spectra .",
    "the detection of lyman continuum absorption and of ly@xmath5 absorption lines between us and the qsos has been used to derive @xmath0 from @xmath12  @xmath3 to @xmath13  @xmath3 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "attempts have been made to fit @xmath0 over many decades of @xmath14 with a simple power law .",
    "however , it is more physically meaningful to expect a power law behavior for @xmath1 , the total ( neutral+ionized ) column density distribution .",
    "in fact , due to drastic changes in the hydrogen ionization fraction when the gas becomes optically thin to photons above 13.6  ev , breaks in @xmath0 appear for @xmath15@xmath16  @xmath3 , where a small decrease of @xmath6 corresponds to a rapid change in @xmath14 .",
    "a more appropriate approach is to compare the observed @xmath0 to the @xmath14 distribution function derived from an assumed @xmath1 , after ionization changes corrections have been applied .",
    "this method has been used by @xcite to derive the slope of @xmath1 , assumed to be @xmath17 , and the ionization conditions of the gas at redshifts @xmath18@xmath19 .",
    "since the frequency of intervening absorption systems is high at these redshifts , it has been possible to limit the analysis to high column density absorbers , using data relative to ( mostly neutral ) damped ly@xmath5 absorption systems , and to ( mostly ionized ) lyman limit systems .",
    "a comparison of models for dark matter confined systems with the observed @xmath0 led to values of @xmath20 for @xmath18@xmath19 ; an extrapolation of this power law distribution towards systems of lower column density , the ly@xmath5 forest , gives reasonable fits for @xmath21  @xmath3 .    at lower redshifts",
    "the number density of absorption systems is much lower and the poor statistics based on lyman limit and damped ly@xmath5 alone does not allow a determination of the distribution function @xmath1 . at zero redshift",
    "however these studies can be complemented with detailed observations of 21-cm emission line radiation from nearby galaxies .",
    "21-cm emission data have the advantage of leaving small uncertainties on @xmath14 , while saturated lyman limit breaks in qsos spectra give only lower limits on the intervening @xmath14 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a correct statistical treatment of such measurements ) .",
    "if 21-cm observations are sensitive enough to   column densities where the hydrogen gas is mostly ionized in the presence of a uv radiation field , then we could use these data to infer @xmath1 and the intensity of the ionizing background radiation in the local universe , which is not directly observable .",
    "similarly , the observed sharp drop of the  column density in the outer disk of two nearby spiral galaxies , m33 and ngc3198 , interpreted as an -  transition zone , made possible an estimate of the uv ionizing flux at @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the known dark matter content of these galaxies , inferred from the gas kinematics , reduced the associated uncertainties . in this paper",
    "we shall give additional evidence for a uv ionizing background in the local universe using the shape of the observed @xmath0 .",
    "we derive power law fits to @xmath1 which reproduce @xmath0 quite well over many orders of magnitude , after ionization corrections have been applied .",
    "we underline the observations needed in the future to reduce the ambiguities in modeling the ionization corrections and the resulting best fitting values of @xmath22 .",
    "we briefly discuss two different evolutionary scenarios for gaseous structures in the universe , both compatible with the present data .",
    "at low redshifts there are two different sets of data which can be used to derive @xmath0 :    _ - ly@xmath5 absorption lines and lyman breaks observed in qsos spectra_. the hubble space telescope ( hst ) has provided good quality data for low redshift absorption systems . @xcite and @xcite have analyzed hst / fuse data for redshifts @xmath23 and @xmath24  @xmath3 . @xcite",
    "have analyzed data for @xmath25  @xmath3 in a broader redshift range ( @xmath26 ) and found a weak evolution in the number of absorbers per unit redshift .",
    "as @xcite have already pointed out there is good agreement between the @xmath14 distributions derived from the two sets of data and therefore we limit ourselves to the @xcite data , shown in figure  1@xmath27 .",
    "for higher column densities @xmath0 at @xmath28 is evaluated from the lyman limit and damped ly@xmath5 data collection of @xcite over the redshift interval @xmath29 , taking into account the mild evolution of lyman limit systems @xcite .",
    "_ - 21-cm maps of nearby galaxies and the   mass function_. 21-cm observation of the   gas in nearby galaxies with high resolution and sensitivity provide data on @xmath30 , the galaxy differential cross section for a given range of @xmath14 , averaged over all inclinations .",
    "this information , acquired for galaxies of different   masses and coupled with the   mass function , @xmath31 , gives @xmath0 :    @xmath32    in order to determine @xmath0 across the region where the hydrogen becomes mostly ionized , observations should be sensitive to column densities down to @xmath33  @xmath3 .",
    "recently the   parkes all sky survey ( hipass ) together with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) has provided good quality data for @xmath31 and for @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "fitting the data with a schechter function @xcite , the resulting @xmath31 has a characteristic  mass value @xmath35 m@xmath36 , a faint end slope @xmath37 , and a normalization @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "similar values have been obtained recently also by @xcite .",
    "we use this mass function in the following analysis and consider 6 mass bins of equal width across the range @xmath39)@xmath40 . @xcite",
    "have evaluated @xmath34 for two @xmath41 ranges : for @xmath42  m@xmath36 and for @xmath43  m@xmath36 . in the literature",
    "there are furthermore two galaxies which have been mapped in great detail down to a low surface density : m33 and ngc3198 .",
    "we compute @xmath44 for these galaxies as orientation averages of the face on cross sections , obtained from the deconvolution of the observed @xmath14 radial profiles with the best fitted tilted ring model @xcite .",
    "the  mass of m33 is @xmath45  m@xmath46 for a distance of 0.84  mpc and that of ngc3198 is @xmath47  m@xmath46 for a distance of 9.4  mpc .",
    "data on these two galaxies can therefore be used for @xmath34 in the two mass bins spanning @xmath48  m@xmath46 . in order to estimate @xmath44 for @xmath49  m@xmath46 , where we have no data , we have averaged the values on the adjacent @xmath41 bins .",
    "@xmath0 , as derived from equation  ( 1 ) , is plotted in figure  1@xmath50 .",
    "the atca data @xcite , as well as the m33 and ngc3198 data , show the `` footprint '' of ionization . while in 21-cm emission maps the ionization has the effect of giving a sharp drop to the radial decline of @xmath14 , in the distribution function this translates into a plateau where the -  transition occurs .",
    "when the gas becomes mostly ionized , at lower @xmath14 values , @xmath0 rises again but it is offset with respect to the neutral side and has a slope which depends on how the /  ratio varies with @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "figure  1@xmath50 shows that this is indeed the behavior of @xmath0 , even though the sum over different mass bins may have smoothed somewhat the -  transition ( if the gas vertical stratification depends on the galaxy mass ) .",
    "in order to evaluate @xmath0 over the range @xmath51  @xmath3 in the local universe we select qsos absorption data for @xmath52  @xmath3 and 21-cm emission data at higher @xmath14 . we exclude both the very low column density ly@xmath5 forest , since it may not be associated with denser structures , and the very high column density data , because star and molecular gas formation might have reduced the original  column density . while simple power law fits to @xmath0",
    "fail we will show in what follows that a power law for the total hydrogen distribution can instead well fit all the data displayed in figure  2 . as in @xcite we derive a theoretical @xmath0 after applying the @xmath53 conversion relation to an assumed power law distribution for the total gas column density , @xmath54 .",
    "the use of 21-cm data eliminates the problem of having large errors in @xmath14 in the region where lyman limit systems become saturated and therefore we can safely use @xmath0 binned over small @xmath14 intervals .",
    "we consider two possible @xmath55 conversion models for @xmath56  @xmath3 :    -@xmath27 the model used by @xcite to fit the data on lyman limit and damped ly@xmath5 systems , as described in their section 3 , extended to lower column density systems .",
    "this model is valid for a dark matter confined gas with ionization fractions which increase steadily as the total gas column density decreases .",
    "-@xmath50 the model used by @xcite only for @xmath57 ; for @xmath58 we keep constant the h ionization fraction , equal to that reached for @xmath59 .",
    "a constant ionization fraction for @xmath60 is achieved if the average gas volume density stays constant as @xmath6 decreases below @xmath61 .",
    "a constant gas volume density might imply either that a constant external pressure is confining the gas or that dark matter and turbulence are distributed in such a way as to give a gas vertical dispersion which does not depend on the gas column density .    for both @xmath27 and @xmath50",
    "we find the best fitting value of @xmath5 and of @xmath62 .",
    "this is the ratio between the intensity of the background flux at 912   normalized to @xmath63  ergs  @xmath3  s@xmath64 hz@xmath64  sr@xmath64 , and the gas compression factor @xmath65 due to gravity from matter other than the gas ( e.g.dark matter ) .",
    "the constant @xmath65 adds to the gas self gravity in vertical scale height expression @xcite :    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the total mass surface density per @xmath3 of gas , @xmath68 is the thermal sound speed and @xmath69 is the value of @xmath68 for @xmath70 k. for model @xmath27 the minimum value of @xmath71 ( 1.3 ) corresponds to @xmath72 and to @xmath73 .",
    "the 3-@xmath74 uncertainties on @xmath5 are @xmath75 , on @xmath76 are @xmath77 .",
    "an @xmath78 power law is therefore compatible with the data .",
    "this is important since there have been often claims that @xmath0 for disk like structures should follow an @xmath79 power law @xcite , but @xmath0 observed in galaxies strongly deviates from this law @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising since it is @xmath1 which should eventually scale as @xmath80 for disk like systems , and we have shown that for model @xmath27 the present data are compatible with this law . for model @xmath50",
    "the best fit gives @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "this model fits the data better than model @xmath27 with 0.5 being the minimum @xmath71 value .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 are shown in figure  2 together with the data used for the @xmath71 minimization .",
    "both best fitting models reproduce rather well also the high and low column density qso s absorption data , not used for the fit , but shown in the figure as well .",
    "a pure power law with no ionization corrections fails since it gives a minimum @xmath84 .",
    "unfortunately the present data are not sufficient to discriminate between @xmath27 and @xmath50 type of model .",
    "this is mostly due to the lack of data around @xmath85  @xmath3 and to the uncertainties on the conversion of atomic hydrogen gas into other baryonic forms at very high column densities . in these two regions @xmath27 and @xmath50 model predictions for @xmath0 differ substantially .    the two best fitting power laws for @xmath1 imply a quite different degree of ionization and therefore different total gas densities in the local universe . for model @xmath27",
    "most of the gas resides in low column density absorbers ; h neutral fractions are of order 0.002 for @xmath86  @xmath3 and are as low as @xmath87 for @xmath88  @xmath3 .",
    "the total gas density(h+he ) predicted by this distribution for @xmath89 gives @xmath90 with a 3@xmath74 range of @xmath91 .",
    "model @xmath50 instead predicts a lower total density of gas in the same range of @xmath14 : @xmath92 with a 3@xmath74 range of @xmath93 .",
    "we now discuss the best fitting power laws for @xmath1 derived in the previous sections , taking into account the known limits on the uv ionizing background flux at @xmath9 , the limits on the density of baryonic matter , @xmath94 , and the total gas column density distribution obtained for qsos absorbers at @xmath95 by @xcite .",
    "limits on the intensity of the uv ionizing background at @xmath9 rely on several indirect techniques such as those based on the detection of a sharp cutoff in the  surface density of outer disks of nearby galaxies @xcite , on searches for h@xmath5 emission from outer disks or from intergalactic   clouds @xcite , on measurements of column densities of metal species in intergalactic  clouds @xcite .",
    "the range @xmath96 is consistent with the above limits as well as with the determination of the uv ionizing background from the qsos luminosity function , even considering possible additional contributions of photons escaping from star forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "measurements of the proximity effect for @xmath97 have been reported @xcite but the resulting ionizing background intensity , @xmath98 , is highly uncertain due to possible clustering of the ly@xmath5 forest around qsos and to a possible evolution over the used @xmath99 range .",
    "the total density of baryonic matter can be inferred from deuterium abundances , @xmath100 @xcite . for a universe with @xmath101 and @xmath102 this @xmath94 value limits the power law index of the total gas column density distribution derived by @xcite at higher redshifts to values @xmath103 .",
    "the extrapolation of the same power law towards the ly@xmath5 forest requires however that ionization conditions of the gas stay constant for @xmath104  @xmath3 at these redshifts i.e.  for @xmath105  @xmath3 . in the following",
    "we shall assume that the gas distribution at @xmath95 is well described by the best - fit 1 model of @xcite ( @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , see their table 1 ) .",
    "if today the gas is distributed according to the best fitting model @xmath27 , with @xmath109 , the limits on @xmath110 and on @xmath94 at @xmath9 force the gas compression factor to be @xmath111 . according to this model the following evolutionary scenario might hold : because changes in time of the ionization conditions of the gas are mild , the average gas compression factor should decrease with time in order to balance the decrease of @xmath110 .",
    "if the dark matter is confining and compressing the gas then today s systems have on average a lower dark matter density than systems at earlier times .",
    "the alternative would be to invoke a steadily increasing turbulence which lowers the effective compression @xmath65 , or additional ionization sources in the surroundings of gaseous clouds .",
    "the power law index for the total gas column density distribution from @xmath112 to @xmath11 becomes slightly steeper and now it is compatible with a disk - like geometry . for model @xmath27",
    "the gas associated with the ly@xmath5 forest clouds is , even today , the dominant reservoir of baryonic matter in the universe .",
    "the best fitting model @xmath50 at @xmath11 implies a constant hydrogen neutral fraction , of order @xmath113 , for @xmath114  @xmath3 .",
    "the power law index for @xmath1 in this case is @xmath115 and @xmath116 . in order to explain the flattening of the power law index for @xmath1 with time",
    ", we invoke a scenario in which low column density structures collapse towards the center or merge to form higher column density structures . if @xmath65 is constant through the evolution of the universe , the required ionizing background radiation at @xmath9 would equal that estimated by @xcite for qsos as primary sources of ionizing photons .",
    "if the external pressure is responsible for confining the gas and keeping constant the ionizing fraction at low column densities , the inferred value of @xmath117 is also constant through redshifts and is @xmath117/(@xmath118  k )  @xmath119  @xcite .",
    "this excludes that @xmath117 is dominated by a diffuse and pervasive intergalactic medium since this is expected to decrease with time .",
    "however , the merging or the collapse of low column density structures is likely to trigger star formation and outflows of hot gas into the intergalactic medium ; this hot gas at temperatures t@xmath120@xmath121  k would be the likely confining medium of low column density ly@xmath5 clouds and it would contribute mostly to the density of baryonic matter in the local universe @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have shown that ionizing radiation affects the neutral gas distribution in the local universe and that any attempt to fit @xmath0 with a simple power law across the -  transition region ( @xmath122  @xmath3 ) can lead to misleading results . a power law distribution for the total gas column density instead fits the data",
    "reasonably well , from the ly@xmath5 forest to the high gas column density in galaxies .",
    "additional 21-cm data , as well as new lyman limit searches at low redshifts , are needed to implement the knowledge of @xmath0 in this delicate region and draw a more definite conclusion on the slope of the total gas column density distribution .",
    "furthermore , if 21-cm data are analyzed in detail to constrain the gas and dark matter distribution in outer disks , one can assign a more definite value to the gas compression and picture a unique evolutionary scenario for the gas distribution and the uv ionizing background in the universe .",
