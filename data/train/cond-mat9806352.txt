    "aluminum oxide @xmath3 is of great importance to modern technology .",
    "it is using as crystal optical materials , active laser element matrices , radiation stable ceramics , e.t.c .",
    "recently there has been a considerable interest in studding of the optical properties of corundum and the radiation influence on its electron - energetic structure in ultra violate ( uv ) and vacuum ultra - violate ( vuv ) spectra regions [ 1 - 8 ] .",
    "corundum in @xmath4-phase is transparent in vuv spectrum region .",
    "it conserves this property under high energy particle radiation .    the phenomenological picture of wave propagation in matter is often used to study the interaction of electromagnetic emission with condensed matter states @xcite .",
    "the ideal conditions for all phenomenological constants are imposed ( proposed ) . among them",
    "are dielectric @xmath5 and optical @xmath6 , @xmath7 constants .",
    "the studding of dielectric and other constants gives the direct information about intrinsic processes in crystals , in particular , corundum .",
    "however by some reasons the direct measurement of these constants is difficult task .",
    "for example , the very thin matter layers are necessary in order to measure the @xmath4-absorption ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "so , the indirect measurement of optical constants is one of the main problems of the spectroscopy .",
    "there is a sufficiently accurate method to determine the optical constants by means of reflection coefficient of light in wide band region of spectra .",
    "one of the main methods applying in the fundamental absorption region is the dielectric constant calculation using kramers - kronig relations @xcite .    in this article the optical constants and optical functions of corundum monocrystal",
    "are investigated using the optical reflection spectra and irradiation influence on their energetic structure .",
    "the relative reflection of crystalls was measured by means of synchrotron radiation ( sr ) of c-60 accelerator . the device used in experiment",
    "is based on monochromator constructed by vodsvort modification scheme without band , which has the better resolution than 10 nm .",
    "the resolution of spectra measurement in low energy region was @xmath9 , in high energy region it was @xmath10 and energy resolution was about @xmath11 .",
    "the dispersion relations , @xmath12 phase , @xmath6 and @xmath13 constants was calculated using the experimental data of reflection coefficient @xmath14 at @xmath15 and kramers - kronig dispersion relation . the reflection coefficient is known in the restricted frequency region from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "thus the contribution of other regions is essential .",
    "the frequencies below @xmath16 are in the transparency region of @xmath3 crystal . at the same time",
    "@xmath18 , because @xmath19 is real and the reper values of @xmath14 was determined from @xmath6 coefficients , which was measured independently using frenel formulae .",
    "the high frequency approximation ( @xmath20 ) is @xmath21 .",
    "the optical functions @xmath6 , @xmath13 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 [ 10 - 12 ] were determined from @xmath27 in @xmath28 region , where @xmath14 was measured .",
    "for @xmath3 the molecule density is @xmath29 .    for the @xmath14 measurement the @xmath3 samples , which were grew by means of horizontally oriented crystallization ( hoc ) and verneil methods",
    ", was used .",
    "the optical axes @xmath1 was parallel to large side of crystal .",
    "the samples had a good mirror surface .",
    "the crystals were cultivated by @xmath30 and washed by pure water before the reflection spectra measurements .",
    "the corundum monocrystals were irradiated by electrons of @xmath31 energy at @xmath32 and by reactor neutrons of energy @xmath33 at @xmath34 .",
    "fig.1 and fig.2 contain the experimental reflection spectra @xmath14 of hoc and verneil crystals .",
    "it can be observed from the pictures that a weak maximums ( bands ) of @xmath35 ; @xmath36 ; @xmath37 for verneil and of @xmath38 for hoc crystals appear in low energy band of spectra @xmath14 .",
    "these bands for irradiated crystals we related to @xmath39 and @xmath40 centers @xcite .",
    "the appearance of bands @xmath41 and @xmath42 is caused by ferrum group ions @xmath43 , which have different anisotropy . @xmath44",
    "ion concentration in verneil samples was @xmath45 , in hoc samples was @xmath46 .",
    "after radiation the @xmath14 spectra maximums , mentioned above , increase and become more precise ( the curves ) .",
    "these are the absorption bands of @xmath35 ; @xmath36 ; @xmath37 and @xmath47 , caused by @xmath48-center and the band of @xmath38 , caused by @xmath40-center .",
    "the radiation and essentially electron , neutron action changes the reducible center medium stronger than it is expected by the elastic interaction theory .",
    "note , that the defect formation under the neutron radiation of corundum is much more faster than one under the high speed electron radiation at same doses .",
    "it can be seen from the experimental data of @xmath14 that the electric field changes intensively on near - surface layers due to defect compound .",
    "this affects on point color centers .    in @xmath14 spectra of @xmath3",
    "the intensive long wave peak at @xmath49 appears .",
    "the exciton peak depends on sr polarization and orientation of crystal ( fig.1,2 ) .",
    "after the radiation the shift of exciton band maximum on @xmath50 can be observed .",
    "the anion @xmath51-excitons are created , because the high valent band of @xmath52 is formed by @xmath2 states of oxide anions @xcite .",
    "it is known that the ... of exciton bands is the consequence of the selection rule , according to which the during the absorption photon quasimomentum is conserved and translated to exciton .    the large bandwidth and inhomogeneosy of exciton spectra absorption",
    "is explained by mixed ( hybrid ) character of exciton states . it is known that that the hybrid excitons as a `` sum '' of hyperbolic and parabolic ones are observed at the energetical degeneracy of critical points @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "hyperbolic excitons are not dynamically stable and decompose on free electrons and holes .",
    "the mixed character of exciton absorption bands can be explained by different bond energies of excitons @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "there is a nonelementar wide - band maximum in the reflection spectra of irradiated crystals in the region @xmath55 .",
    "band group in @xmath14 of hoc crystals is more precise than in verneil samples .",
    "this fact is connected with the presence of doped ions on the surface of verneil crystals , which leads to the stoichiometry violation in anion and cation sublattices .    from the pictures ,",
    "the values of reflection coefficients in radiated samples begin to fall .",
    "it proves the radiation influence on crystal surface . besides the near - surface defects the scattering effect increases too , which also contributes to reflection coefficient .    during the ( electron , neutron )",
    "radiation of corundum the crystal structure disorder of near - surface increases because of high concentration of vacancies and interband ions .",
    "the radiation stimulated desorbation process takes place with recovered @xmath56 phase as a result @xcite .",
    "besides the point vacancy defects the complicated color centers of @xmath57 $ ] type with various charge states can be formed @xcite .",
    "other mechanism of defect formation in near - surface layers is also possible .",
    "it is based on dislocation formation model @xcite .",
    "the consequence of corundum surface decoration by @xmath56 ions is the reflection improvement of radiated crystals at energy @xmath58 .",
    "the optical constants , calculated from experimental @xmath14 changes also ( fig.3 - 8 ) .",
    "the band group is well observed in @xmath59 spectra also .",
    "it is easy to see from fig.3,4 that the optical constant @xmath6 has thin structure at different orientations between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the high resolution reflection spectra was measured owing to both higher intensity and polarization of sr than in @xcite . the difference in @xmath60 spectra on fig.3 and",
    "4 is conditioned by the value of special energetic state of surface , which affects on radiation irregularity formation in hoc and verneil samples .",
    "the reflection band group ( fig.1,2)in region @xmath55 is showed precisely in @xmath59 spectra also ( fig.3 - 8 ) . according to calculations , the values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 differs for different orientations between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the radiation influence on dielectric constant is essential . up to energy",
    "@xmath61 @xmath23 and @xmath7 vanish .",
    "it is easy to see from the @xmath23 spectra , that for hoc in case of @xmath62 the enegry is @xmath63 and in case of @xmath64 it is @xmath65 . for verneil samples the @xmath23 value corresponds to @xmath63 and @xmath66 and after the electron radiation",
    "it becomes @xmath65 and @xmath67 .",
    "the data , reduced from optical constant spectra ( fig.5,8 ) , confirm that the polarization effects are connected with splitting of valence @xmath2-states of oxygen in low symmetry fields of corundum lattice .",
    "the interband state maximal density change effect probably is connected with the transitions from the highest intensive maximum in density of states of @xmath2-band .",
    "this is due to increase of defect concentration in near - surface layers ( expessially for neutron radiation ) .    in order to estimate quantitatively",
    "the interband intervals the calculations of interband combined density @xmath68 ( fig.9,10 ) and energetic loss functions @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( fig.11,12 ) .",
    "it can be seen from the energetic loss functions of electrons in hoc crystals that in case of @xmath62 the largest value of volumetric plasmon @xmath71 of radiated and irradiated crystal are @xmath72 and @xmath73 correspondingly ( the curves 1,3 ) .",
    "the maximums of surface plasmon @xmath70 of radiated and irradiated crystal are @xmath74 and @xmath75 correspondingly ( the curves 2,4 ) . in case of @xmath64 for @xmath71 one",
    "has maximums at @xmath72 , @xmath75 ( the curves 1,3 ) and for @xmath70 one has maximums at @xmath75 , @xmath63 .    for verneil crystals in the energetic loss functions the maximums in case of @xmath62 ( fig.12 ) for @xmath71",
    "are @xmath76 and @xmath73 ( the curves 1,3 ) and for @xmath70 its are @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( the curves 2,4 ) . in case of @xmath77 ( fig.12 ) for @xmath71 one has maximums at @xmath78 , @xmath73 ( the curves 1,3 ) and for @xmath70 one has maximums at @xmath72 , @xmath74 .    note , that the value @xmath71 is proportional to the energy loss probability of quasi - free gas electrons in @xmath3 .",
    "it describes the maximal fluctuation of plasmon energy , which constitutes @xmath76 at nonpolarized light .    besides the intensive plasma fluctuations in @xmath71 spectra the weak peeks",
    "are observed in the regions @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath67 .",
    "its are the consequences of energy loss of near - surface and volumetric @xmath56 plasmons of nonirradiated and irradiated corundum crystals .",
    "the characteristic loss spectra shows that @xmath56 plasmon peek location depends drastically on both type and doze of radiation action and leads to shift on @xmath84 .",
    "the effective electron number @xmath26 is calculated from the sum rule , which express the fact that the sum of all oscillator forces equals to electron number .    in the plasmon energy region",
    "@xmath26 reaches @xmath85 electrons per @xmath52 molecule , which has @xmath86 valence @xmath2-electrons . the fact that its are not saturated means the oscillator are not entirely strengthless",
    "hence , the absorption , which contributes to the sum rule , must be below and higher @xmath87 ( fig.13 ) .",
    "using arand curves for hoc and verneil crystals the resonance energies of partial oscillators have been precisely determined .",
    "every semicircle on fig.14 - 17 corresponds to one oscillator , i.e. one interband transition .    to calculate the resonance energies",
    "one first have extrapolated every semicircle and then have found the values @xmath88 using maximum @xmath89 .    in tables",
    "1,2 the identifications of interband transitions for hoc and verneil crystals are presented for two polarizations ( @xmath90 ) taking into account the electron energetic structure of corundum .",
    "thus , our identification of interband transition for corundum crystals shows two effects of polarization and radiation . the first one is connected with splitting of the 2d valence electrons of oxygen in the low symmetry crystal field of corundum .",
    "the second one is related to transition in the upper intensive maximum of the 2p band state density after increasing the radiation defects in near - surface layers .    .",
