    "the possibility of finding terrestrial signatures of near - earth supernova explosions has been intensively discussed over the last decade ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent evidence for a supernova remnant @xmath1 in diameter , that may be associated with 26 @xmath2-rays , points to an explosion within the past few myr and within 100200 pc @xcite . moreover",
    ", the existence of the local bubble  containing hot , rarefied gas in which the sun resides @xcite  suggests that we live in the _ interior _ of one or more supernova remnants ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this enhances the prospects of identifying terrestrial evidence of supernova remnant engulfing the solar system and the earth .",
    "even if it were too far away to be hazardous for life on earth ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a sufficiently close supernova explosion would deposit on the earth supernova ejecta and related material produced by cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "this could have resulted in the possible uptake of supernova - produced elements in deep - ocean sediments or manganese - iron crusts .",
    "following @xcite , @xcite discovered the first evidence for live 60 in a deep - ocean ferromanganese crust , at a level @xmath3 times the expected background and consistent with an event in the last @xmath4 myr at a distance @xmath5 pc @xcite .",
    "however , the structure and geometry of the crust made it difficult to reconstruct a reliable time history , and thus the nature of the 60 signal remained uncertain .",
    "very recently , @xcite have studied a different ferromanganese crust , which is better suited for a high - precision study with good time resolution .",
    "they find a 60 spike far above background in a crust layer which formed between 2.4 and 3.2 myr ago .",
    "this detection confirms the earlier result , but now goes beyond detecting the presence of 60 to revealing the details of its deposition history .",
    "the presence of a live radioisotopic signal in a single , isolated layer agrees with the straightforward expectations of the supernova hypothesis @xcite .",
    "these data greatly strengthen the case that supernova ejecta were deposited on the earth about 3 myr ago .",
    "this is a major new result , and one that finally gives a strong direct empirical basis for longstanding speculation and arguments based on indirect evidence regarding the possibility of near - earth supernova explosions in the geological past .    in light of the @xcite result ,",
    "the time is ripe to take the supernova hypothesis seriously and investigate its consequences quantitatively . specifically ,",
    "in this paper we show how ferromanganese crusts can be used as telescopes to probe directly the _ r_-process in supernovae .",
    "@xcite measured 60 and 53 ( mean life @xmath6 myr ) throughout the ferromanganese crust 237kd , using accelerator mass spectrometry techniques . over the 28 layers studied , just 69 live 60 atoms were detected .",
    "this signal was found uniquely in layers corresponding to a time interval  kyr . ]",
    "t = 2.4 - 3.2  myr before the present .",
    "the resulting isotopic fraction is = ( 1.9 0.24 ) 10 ^ -15 , which is a highly significant result , despite its small magnitude , testifying to the sensitivity and precision of the experiment .",
    "the principal uncertainty in this result is due to instrumental background , essentially the contamination due to stable isobars .    given the crust size and fe composition , the isotopic fraction can be used to infer a surface density of 60 . to do this ,",
    "one must also correct for radioactive decay and geometric effects , and the result is n_60,obs = 2.9 10 ^ 6  atoms / cm^2 . in order to infer the incident fluence of 60 , this result",
    "must be corrected for geometry and an uptake factor . assuming the terrestrial fallout is isotropic , a geometric factor 1/4 arises from the ratio of the earth s full cross section ( @xmath7 ) to its total surface area ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "also , the crust incorporates only a certain percentage of all deposited material incident upon it , and a so - called ` uptake factor ' @xmath9 accounts for this effect ( for further discussion , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , leading to [ eq : surf ] n_i(t)=f_i(-t/ ) .",
    "the uptake factors are different for each sample and every element , and thus can not be evaluated independently of the details of the sample . consequently , in the following discussion we present results for @xmath10 , with the understanding that all the results presented must be reduced by the appropriate uptake factor , which may be inferred from studies of stable isotopes .",
    "@xcite use mn and fe data to infer an iron uptake factor @xmath11 , from which they infer an incident fluence of f_60 , = 2.0 10 ^ 9  atoms / cm^2 .",
    "this signal encodes key information about the supernova explosion , as we now see .",
    "the deposited amount of supernova - produced material of an isotope @xmath12 is dependent on the distance @xmath13 of the event and the total ejected mass @xmath14 .",
    "the fluence , i.e. , the number of atoms per unit area that arrive at the earth , is @xcite : [ eq : flu ] f_i= , where @xmath15 is the mass number of isotope @xmath12 and @xmath16 is the proton mass .",
    "present - day measurements of the fluence must also be corrected for decay .",
    "the isotopic fraction of @xmath12 in the crust is determined by the relative amounts of supernova ejecta and substrate deposited within the observed time interval .",
    "if the substrate material has density @xmath17 and deposition rate @xmath18 , then the total mass flux onto the crust is @xmath19 , and the iron flux onto the crust is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 @xcite is the iron mass fraction in the crust , and other elements @xmath12 can be treated in a corresponding way .",
    "finally , if the supernova signal is measured with a time resolution @xmath22 , the surface density of crust atoms deposited is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the mean mass number of the element , and so the isotopic fraction of @xmath12 in the crust is [ eq : isofrac ] & = & e^-t/_i + & = & 1.9 10 ^ -15 ^2 , where the fiducial numbers are for the 60 signal at 3 myr , with @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    the confirmed observation of a live 60 signal spurs us to predict the inventory of all long - lived radioisotopes . for each ,",
    "given the yield @xmath27 , one can readily compute the fluence and/or surface density , based on the 60 signal : n_j = n_60 e^(1/_60 - 1/_i)t , a result that is independent of supernova distance @xmath13 .",
    "consequently , detection of any radioisotopic species @xmath28 would immediately measure the ratio of its yield relative to 60 , and thus probe supernova nucleosynthesis - assuming that the uptake factors @xmath29 are known , and that the earth receives an isotropic ` fair sample ' of all supernova ejecta   can be obtained from studies of stable isotopes or , in the case of 244 , from studies of the recent deposition of anthropogenic pu on the surface of the crust  @xcite . ] .",
    "indeed , even a significant upper limit could provide important information .",
    "the explosion signals divide into radioisotopes from three sources : supernovae , the _ r_-process and cosmic rays , and we consider each of these in turn .      to get an impression of the distance of the supernova , one needs to know the 60 yield @xmath30 of a supernova .",
    "this and the yields of other isotopes have been calculated in @xcite , and more recently again in @xcite .",
    "the 12 supernova explosion models of @xcite span a mass range from @xmath31 , and the 5 newer calculations in @xcite cover the range @xmath32 .",
    "the latter give a higher 60 yield than those calculated in @xcite .",
    "a common feature of the 60 yields in the two papers is strong variation over the observed mass range , which attests to the difficulty of calculating the production of this element , reflected also in differences between the results of @xcite and @xcite for supernovae of similar masses . nevertheless , we use these mass yields together with eq .",
    "( [ eq : flu ] ) to calculate the possible supernova distance @xmath13 , albeit with considerable uncertainties induced by the different mass yields .",
    "( [ eq : isofrac ] ) , and the large variations in distance reflect the large variations in the yields with progenitor mass , and the differences between the curves give a sense of the range of theoretical uncertainty in the yields .",
    "_ , scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the results of this calculation can be seen in fig .  1 , where we see that the distances cover a range between @xmath33 pc and @xmath34pc .",
    "this range is similar to that found in the similar analysis of @xcite .",
    "more generally , this distance range falls within limits set by @xcite and @xcite , who note that a supernova closer than 10 pc could be devastating to life on earth ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas a supernova that was too far away would not have the power to overcome the solar wind and deposit a noticeable amount of isotopes .",
    "having estimated the distance , it is now easy to obtain the surface densities ( [ eq : surf ] ) of other sufficiently long - lived supernova - produced elements like 36 ( @xmath35 myr ) , 53 ( @xmath36 myr ) and 26 ( @xmath37 myr ) , using again the values of @xcite and @xcite for the ejected masses of 36 , 53 and 26 . the results for 53 and 26 are shown in figure 2 , and vary wildly , due to the variations in the 60 mass yields",
    ". a better prediction of the 60 yields would therefore be a valuable input into future calculations .",
    "on the other hand , the detection in the sample of @xcite ( or in comparable samples ) of other isotopes , besides 60 , whose yields are not as wildly varying ( e.g. 26 ) , would allow for a more accurate calculation of the distance and hence stronger predictions for the surface densities of other supernova isotopes , and possibly the supernova mass as well . at the present stage",
    ", the results shown in figure 2 can be used only to get a feel for the expected order of magnitude ( without uptake factors ) of the surface densities of supernova isotopes .",
    "as we see in the next section , the corresponding results for 36 are not worth showing because of the high expected background .     as functions of supernova progenitor mass ( eq .  [ eq : flu ] ) . for 53 and 26 ,",
    "the background levels are indicated .",
    "results are corrected for geometry and decay , but are not corrected for site- and element - dependent uptake factors @xmath29 which appear in eq .",

    "r_-process elements present a special case . these are nuclides which are created when ` seed ' nuclei  typically iron - peak elements  are exposed to a rapid burst of neutrons . whilst the microphysics and thermodynamical requirements for the _ r_-process are fairly well understood , its astrophysical site is not yet known ; both core - collapse supernovae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and neutron - star mergers @xcite have been studied in some detail .",
    "consequently , a firm correlated detection of a known supernova - produced isotope ( e.g. , 36 , 53 , 26 , or 60 ) with an _ r_-process isotope ( 244 , 146 , or 182 ) would be of the utmost importance : it would provide direct proof that at least some supernovae do generate _ r_-process elements .",
    "intriguingly , @xcite report the detection of a single live 244 atom in the same crust that contained the original live 60 signal @xcite .",
    "one obviously should not overinterpret such a marginal result , but we are encouraged that 244 searches are becoming feasible , and we advocate strongly further searches for all _ r_-process elements .",
    "in order to get a feel for the expected order of magnitude of the surface density of 244 , 146 and 182 , we must determine the supernova yields of these elements .",
    "we do this empirically , by noting that , in metal - poor galactic halo stars , the heaviest elements are always distributed in the same ratios as the solar _ r_-process component .",

    "notice again the wild variations at the present stage , which allow the shown results only to give an impression of the expected orders of magnitude of the surface densities .",
    "estimates of the expected backgrounds are given in the next section .",
    "finally , we consider the possibility of a supernova signal due to @xmath44be by cosmic rays .",
    "the explosion of a nearby supernova enhances the cosmic ray flux at earth , and the element that is dominantly produced is @xmath44be ( @xmath45 myr ) .",
    "@xcite estimate that an average supernova will put a fraction @xmath46 of its mechanical energy @xmath47 into the production of cosmic rays with an average energy of @xmath48 gev .",
    "thus we get a cosmic ray fluence of [ eq : crflu ] t=_crf_cr , the deflecting effects of the solar wind mean that only some fraction @xmath49 of cosmic rays penetrate to the earth . following @xcite , we take @xmath50 .",
    "the enhanced cosmic - ray fluence at earth increases radioisotope production in the atmosphere , according to [ eq : branch ] f_i = y_i_pt , where @xmath51 is the branching ratio for cosmic - ray production of isotope @xmath12 ; a useful tabulation of these appears in @xcite . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : branch ] ) with @xmath52 , @xmath53 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : crflu ] ) , and the distances from figure 1 , one finds a @xmath44be fluence of at most @xmath54 , and a surface density of at most @xmath55 .",
    "we now consider the dominant sources of backgrounds to these various signals , which originate from different sources .",
    "the backgrounds for 26 and 53 are dominated by the infall of meteorites .",
    "these have been exposed to cosmic rays , causing an enhancement of certain elements due to spallation .",
    "an introductory discussion of meteoritic backgrounds can be found in @xcite .",
    "the flux @xmath56 of infalling isotopes can be calculated as [ eq : metr ] _",
    "i= , where @xmath57 is the infalling meteoritic mass rate @xcite and @xmath58 is the mass fraction of isotope @xmath12 found in solar - system meteorites .",
    "@xcite examine the production of isotopes in meteorites due to cosmic rays .",
    "they give their main tabulated results in terms of the specific activity @xmath59 , which is the number of decays per minute and kg of iron or rock , respectively , for 53 or 26 .",
    "we take the fiducial values of 400 dpm / kg fe and 40 dpm / kg si .",
    "in fact , 26 has more than one production branch , but as si is the most dominant element we will use it for an estimate of the background .",
    "we assume the infalling meteorites to have an iron mass fraction @xmath60 and a silicon mass fraction @xmath61 @xcite . for a meteorite with such mass fractions ,",
    "we obtain @xmath62 and therefore @xmath63 and @xmath64 . with these",
    ", we find fluxes of ( 53 ) & = & 1.7 10 ^ 9  myr^-1cm^-2 , + ( 26 ) & = & 4.3 10 ^ 7  myr^-1cm^-2 . in order to calculate the background fluence and surface density we have to multiply the flux by the time resolution .",
    "recalling that the 60 signal in @xcite spreads over a time of approximately @xmath65 myr , we obtain surface densities of n(53 ) & = & 8.4 10 ^ 7 atoms cm^-2 , + n(26 ) & = & 2.4 10 ^ 5 atoms cm^-2 . in comparison with the signal strengths of order @xmath66 for 53 and @xmath67 for 26 , these backgrounds are negligible .",
    "a different approach has to be taken for calculating the backgrounds to 36 and 10 , as these nuclides are primarily produced by the direct interaction of cosmic rays with the atmosphere . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : branch ] ) , with the ambient cosmic - ray proton flux @xmath68 and a time resolution @xmath69 myr , for 36 one finds @xmath70 .",
    "consequently , one obtains a present - day surface density of n(36)=2.0 10 ^ 7 atoms cm^-2 .",
    "this is to be compared with a signal strength @xmath71 and we therefore do not expect the detection of 36 in the ferromanganese crust sample of @xcite or in similar samples .      as 146 , 182 and 244 are extinct radioactive isotopes , they do not have a significant abundance in solar - system meteorites .",
    "moreover , they are not produced in sufficient amounts by cosmic ray spallation .",
    "the only background source is spontaneous fission of actinides .",
    "such decays lead to a distribution of daughter products , but these only contribute significantly to 146 , not to 182 .",
    "we estimate the spontaneous fission background of 146 as follows .",
    "the dominant parent nucleus is , with a fission lifetime @xmath72 yr .",
    "if the fission branching ratio to 146 is @xmath73 , then the equilibrium 146 fission background thus has @xmath74 .",
    "the 146 background flux onto the crust is then @xmath75 ( where @xmath28 is the total mass flux onto the sample , and @xmath76 is the mass fraction of in the earth s crust ) .",
    "thus the background accumulated in a resolution time @xmath77 myr is n_146,bgd = u f x_238 3.6 10 ^ 7 u which is larger then our prediction by about an order of magnitude .",
    "thus we conclude that the 146 is probably too small to see .    since 244 is _ heavier",
    "_ than ambient u and th , it is not produced by fission .",
    "apart from recent human activity , the only known possible source of 244 is the _ r_-process .",
    "moreover , anthropogenic 244 is expected to be negligible in the ferromanganese crusts of interest .",
    "following the prediction of @xcite , @xcite found initial evidence for supernova 60 in a ferromanganese crust , prompting @xcite to discuss other isotopic signatures of a nearby supernova .",
    "the exciting new result of @xcite confirms the earlier observation with higher significance and more precise dating , motivating this paper . using the data of @xcite to estimate the local interstellar fluence of 60 and combining this with the total mass of 60 ejected by diverse supernovae @xcite",
    ", we have inferred a supernova distance range @xmath78 pc , consistent with @xcite .",
    "the 60 detection and nucleosynthesis models together allow us to make distance - independent predictions for other radioisotopes . for supernova - produced isotopes such as 26 , 53 and 36 , we find that yields of the first two of these isotopes are likely to be detectable above background .",
    "we also consider the _",
    "r_-process elements 244 , 182 , and 146 , finding again that the first two are likely to exceed background .",
    "if the supernova responsible for the 60 observations of @xcite was also a site for the _ r_-process , clear signals should be visible .",
    "this would finally provide direct proof that supernovae are sites for the _ r_-process .",
    "the firm detection of 60 also adds support to recent ideas regarding the origin of the local bubble .",
    "@xcite concluded that several events are needed to create the local bubble , the last occurring within the past 5 myr in order to maintain the high interstellar temperature .",
    "@xcite argued that the need for multiple events points to correlated explosions within an ob association , and specifically suggested the lower centarus crux ( lcc ) of the sco - cen association as the likely site . @xcite",
    "have examined the possibility that this ob association could have been the site of the 60 progenitor . from kinematic considerations they find that the closest approach of the lcc was about 100 pc , with considerable uncertainties .",
    "taken at face value , this result is in the upper part of our range of distance estimates .",
    "this suggests that either the event was a distant one ( and thus the 60 yield was high ) , or that the lcc approach was closer than estimated , or that the lcc was not the event site .",
    "the accuracies of our predictions for the fluences of these isotopes are limited by the wide variations in the 60 yields found in calculations for different progenitor masses , and between different model calculations @xcite .",
    "therefore , at the present stage our results give only approximate estimates of the expected orders of magnitude of the fluences of supernova isotopes .",
    "this underlines the great need for more theoretical studies of 60 production in supernovae , able to reduce the calculational uncertainties .",
    "such a reduction would be necessary before one could predict any biological effects that might be associated with the supernova responsible for the 60 observations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "measurements using other ferromanganese crusts would be most welcome , and observations of other supernova radioisotopes have high priority .",
    "these would enable one to evade the uncertainties associated with the 60 yield .",
    "another helpful calibration point comes from the recent evidence @xcite for the @xmath2-ray line signal from the decay of interstellar 60 .",
    "this reflects the current galactic 60 inventory , and constrains 60 nucleosynthesis averaged over all sources @xcite .",
    "the important results of @xcite and @xcite open up a new era of ` deep - ocean crust astronomy ' . after providing already the first observations of the terrestrial impact of a nearby supernova",
    ", their measurements now offer the prospect of verifying directly that the _ r_-process takes place , at least partly , in ejecta from supernovae ."
