    "we focus on @xmath128 , fix @xmath162 , and show @xmath104 for three different ratios of @xmath161 .",
    "we see that there is a regime where @xmath104 is positive and increases with temperature , roughly when @xmath163 .",
    "all thermal spin waves have @xmath164 ( assuming a vanishingly small spin - wave gap ) , and if @xmath163 then this causes the diffuson modes excited by thermal spin waves to have @xmath165 .",
    "a simplification of ( [ eq : conddif ] ) with @xmath1 would indeed be consistent with neglecting @xmath166 compared to @xmath0 . from our results however , we have no indication that the correction has a linear @xmath4-dependence over an extended range of temperatures .",
    "we note that the linear contribution to @xmath167 observed in the experiments of ref .",
    "could possibly be explained as a precursor of a transition into the ballistic regime . for ballistic transport , with @xmath168 , the ( regular ) coulomb altshuler - aronov correction is known to become linear in temperature for effectively two - dimensional systems .",
    "the sign of this contribution was found to depend on the strength of the interaction:@xcite for weak interaction one finds a linear contribution to @xmath169 with a positive sign , as observed experimentally in ref .  .",
    "we finally compare the order of magnitude of the spin - wave - induced altshuler - aronov correction we found to that of the coulomb interaction correction .",
    "we set @xmath170 , for which the latter reads in the diffusive limit@xcite @xmath171 where @xmath172 is a numerical factor .",
    "we compare this correction to our clean result of sec .",
    "[ sec : clean ] .",
    "for @xmath170 we see that the spin - wave - induced correction tends to be @xmath173 , which indicates that this correction could become dominant for higher temperatures .",
    "we thus assume @xmath174 , for which we find @xmath175 where we assumed that @xmath176 , @xmath177 , and @xmath178 .",
    "a straightforward comparison of the two corrections yields a minimum temperature for the spin - wave - induced corrections to dominate , @xmath179 taking parameters from refs .   and for iron ( @xmath180  k ,",
    "@xmath181  ev ) we find for @xmath182  s@xmath183 a minimum temperature of @xmath184  k. this in principle allows for a significant regime of temperatures where the spin - wave - induced altshuler - aronov correction could be the dominant quantum correction to the conductivity .",
    "we caution that the results from sec .",
    "[ sec : clean ] were derived under the assumption that @xmath4 is much smaller than @xmath185 , which is only a factor @xmath186 larger than @xmath187 .",
    "this means that the estimate ( [ eq : tmin ] ) has to be interpreted as of a rather qualitative nature .",
    "we acknowledge very helpful discussions with georg schwiete , martin schneider , and karsten flensberg .",
    "this work was supported by the alexander von humboldt foundation in the framework of the alexander von humboldt professorship program , endowed by the federal ministry of education and research .",
    "the exchange splitting @xmath0 can differ from @xmath188 if exchange interactions between conduction electrons are taken into account .",
    "we will thus not make use of the relation @xmath189 , but keep @xmath0 as an independent parameter instead .          at first sight",
    "only diagrams 2 , 9 , and 10 seem to be relevant , since those are the only ones containing three diffuson ladders .",
    "these diagrams however contain scattering events that , to first approximation , randomize the relative direction of the momenta at the two current vertices . to get a finite contribution from these diagrams",
    ", one needs to track the correlation between the two momenta by expanding the short - range green functions in small @xmath83 .",
    "since this yields a small factor , one should also include the leading diagrams without scattering events connecting the upper and lower green functions : diagrams 1 , 57 ( describing a hikami box ) , and 8 .    for a strictly two - dimensional sample , one should use ( 3.26 ) from ref .",
    "expansion in @xmath190 then yields exactly the same expression as ( [ eq : largd ] ) but with the numerical factor @xmath191 replaced by @xmath192 : the result is larger by a factor @xmath193 ."
