    "during the last three decades a wealth of research results on fluctuations or noise have lead us to the recognition that in many situations noise can actually play a constructive role that induces new ordering phenomena .",
    "some examples are stochastic resonance in zero ",
    "dimensional @xcite and extended systems @xcite , noise induced transitions @xcite , noise induced phase transitions @xcite , noise induced transport @xcite , noise sustained patterns @xcite , etc .    most of the studies on the noise induced phenomena indicated above assume that the noise source has a gaussian distribution ( either white or colored ) .",
    "in addition to the intrinsic interest in the study of non ",
    "gaussian noises , there are some experimental evidences , particularly in sensory and biological systems @xcite , indicating that at least in some of these phenomena the noise sources could be non  gaussian . the use of non ",
    "gaussian noises in studies on noise induced phenomena is scarce mainly due to the mathematical difficulties .",
    "this is in contrast with the existence of some analytical tools when working with gaussian ( particularly white ) noises .    here",
    "we present some results on one of those noise induced phenomena when driven by a noise source taken as colored and non  gaussian .",
    "it corresponds to a _ noise induced transition _ like those discussed in @xcite .",
    "the problem we discuss here corresponds the so called _ genetic model _ which follows from a particular biological modeling or from a chemical reaction @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the effect of a colored gaussian ( ornstein  uhlenbeck ) noise on that model was analyzed in detail and a novel reentrance phenomenon in the phase diagram was found . in order to study the effect that the non  gaussian nature of the noise can have in the transition , we have used here a particular distribution @xcite",
    "whose departure from the gaussian behavior is governed by a parameter @xmath0 : while @xmath1 corresponds to gaussian noise , the value @xmath2 produces a long tail distribution and @xmath3 gives a cut - off distribution . as discussed for other noise induced phenomena in @xcite , we have found that the departure from the gaussian distribution for the noise produces a strong effect . in this case",
    "such an effect corresponds to an anticipation of the transition when the distribution has long tails , and to a retardation when it is cut - off .",
    "this effect could have interesting consequences in the case of noise - induced-*phase * transitions @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we briefly discuss the form and properties of the non  gaussian noise source .",
    "after that , we present the model we analyze here and a simple analytical approximation to treat the non  gaussian noise that allows us to determine some of the general features of the phase diagram .",
    "we continue discussing numerical simulations that support and extend the theoretical results . in the last section",
    "we draw some conclusions .",
    "we start considering the following general form of a langevin equation @xmath4 as described in the introduction , we assume that the noise term @xmath5 has a non  gaussian distribution .",
    "more precisely , we consider that @xmath5 is a markovian process generated as the solution of the following langevin equation@xcite @xmath6 being @xmath7 a standard gaussian white noise of zero mean and correlation @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .\\ ] ] although we believe that our results are quite general , such a particular form for the noise @xmath5 allows us to easily control the departure from the gaussian behavior by changing a single parameter @xmath0 . @xmath10 and @xmath11 are noise parameters related to the noise intensity and the correlation time , as we now detail .",
    "the stationary properties of the noise @xmath12 , including the time correlation function , have been studied in @xcite and here we summarize the main results .",
    "the stationary probability distribution is given by @xmath13 ^{\\frac{-1}{q-1}},\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the normalization factor .",
    "this distribution can be normalized only for @xmath15 .",
    "the first moment , @xmath16 , is always equal to zero , and the second moment , @xmath17 is finite only for @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath3 , the distribution has a cut - off and it is only defined for @xmath19 .",
    "finally , the correlation time @xmath20 of the stationary regime of the process @xmath5 diverges near @xmath21 and it can be approximated over the whole range of values of @xmath0 as @xmath22 . clearly ,",
    "when @xmath23 we recover the limit of @xmath12 being a gaussian colored noise , namely the ornstein  uhlenbeck process , @xmath24 , with correlations @xmath25 and probability distribution @xmath26 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , an effective markovian approximation to the process @xmath12 via a path integral procedure was obtained , that is analogous to the  unified colored noise approximation \" obtained in @xcite for the case of ornstein  uhlenbeck noise .",
    "such an approximation allowed us to get quasi - analytical results for the mean - first - passage time or transition rate .",
    "these results and its dependence on the different parameters in the case of a double well potential were compared with extensive numerical simulations with excellent agreement .",
    "that approximation was also exploited to study stochastic resonance with theoretical results @xcite that are in very good agreement with experimental ones @xcite .",
    "the  effective markovian approximation \" introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and indicated above has been shown to have some drawbacks .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , such an approximation renders a non normalizable stationary probability distribution function , @xmath28 .",
    "this seems to be a general characteristic of such an approximation that , at least in the case discussed in @xcite , was solved introducing an adequate and controlled cutoff .",
    "however , it is not clear that such a methodology could be always used , and particularly for the models we can analyze in relation to noise induced transitions .",
    "hence , for the kind of models we use in order to study the effect of non ",
    "gaussian noises on a noise induced transition we have resorted to a more simple , albeit physically reasonable , approximation .",
    "our aim is at least to obtain some of the main trends in the region @xmath29 ( both for @xmath30 and @xmath2 ) .",
    "the idea is that in such a region the non  gaussian noise will only slightly depart from the gaussian behavior .",
    "hence in eq .",

    "this implies a kind of renormalized ornstein  uhlenbeck ( gaussian ) noise . using this form of the noise",
    "we proceed to study the problem in eq.([equis0 ] ) .    the _ genetic model _",
    "is described by the following equation @xcite @xmath33 and , according to the discussion above , we consider in this work that @xmath34 is a non  gaussian noise described by eqs.([nu1]-[potential ] ) .",
    "the analytical treatment simplifies if we make the change of variables @xmath35 so that the original multiplicative stochastic differential equation ( [ eq:5 ] ) transforms into a new one but now with an additive noise @xmath36 from now on , as in ref.@xcite , and in order to simplify the algebra , in what follows we adopt @xmath37 .    the use of the approximation eq .",

    "this result can be obtained in two ways : ( a ) applying a direct adiabatic - like elimination procedure to the langevin system given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) and eqs .",
    "( [ nu1],[vq2 ] ) @xcite .",
    "that is , taking the derivative of eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) with respect to @xmath41 and setting @xmath42 .",
    "( b ) a formal one , through the application of the path - integral formalism to the indicated non markovian langevin equations , supplemented with a consistent markovian approximation scheme @xcite .    since , by the use of these  drastic \" approximations ,",
    "the problem has been reduced to eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) which contains a white , gaussian , noise , it is easy now , using standard techniques , to obtain the stationary probability density function . for the original variable @xmath43 , it reads @xmath44 ,   \\label{eq:10}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is a normalization constant and @xmath46    a noise induced transition@xcite appears when this density function changes from being unimodal to bimodal .",
    "more specifically , the point @xmath47 changes from being a maximum to being a minimum .",
    "the condition of extremum at @xmath47 and the condition for finding the boundary separating the regions where @xmath47 is a maximum or a minimum yield @xmath48 such that for a fixed @xmath11 , the distribution is bimodal for @xmath49 and it is unimodal for @xmath50 . in the limit @xmath51 , this expression reduces to the result found in @xcite for @xmath52 : @xmath53^{2}}{1 + 3 \\tau}. \\label{eq:13}\\ ] ] figure [ fig1 ] plots the @xmath54 boundary ( the  transition line \" ) for different values of @xmath0 in the @xmath55 plane .",
    "several features can be noticed in this figure .",
    "it is clear that a minimum value of the noise intensity @xmath10 is always needed to induce the transition .",
    "the dependence with the parameter @xmath0 appears as an advancement of the transition to smaller values of @xmath10 when @xmath56 and a retardation when @xmath30 .",
    "we believe that this will be a general behavior for long tail ( power  law ) and cut  off noise distributions , respectively .",
    "a closer look shows the persistence of the reentrance effect previously found in @xcite : for some fixed values of the noise intensity @xmath10 it is possible to obtain a transition , first from unimodal to bimodal and then back to unimodal , just by varying the time correlation @xmath11 of the noise .    these main features ,",
    "as obtained from our very simplifying assumptions are found to be in qualitative agreement with the results coming from numerical simulations of the ( not simplified ) set of equations ( [ nu1],[potential],[genic ] ) ( details of the numerical integration scheme are given in the appendix ) . in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we show that the probability distribution can switch from unimodal to bimodal just by increasing the parameter @xmath0 , for fixed values of @xmath10 and @xmath57 .",
    "the reentrance effect is illustrated , for @xmath1 in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the numerical simulations show that there is a crossing of the transition lines for @xmath3 and @xmath58 , an aspect which is not reproduced by the approximated theoretical results .",
    "another aspect observed in figure [ fig1 ] is that for large @xmath57 , the theoretically predicted transition line , has a smaller linear slope for increasing values of @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq:12 ] ) we have @xmath59 in that limit",
    ". there seems to be not such a strong @xmath0 dependence of the slope of the curves for large @xmath11 in the numerical results .",
    "otherwise , the numerical and theoretical results are in good qualitative agreement .",
    "we have presented some preliminary results on a noise induced phenomenon driven by a colored and non  gaussian noise source that was generated by a @xmath0-distribution .",
    "the phenomenon studied here is a _ noise induced transition _ like those discussed in @xcite , and corresponds the so called _ genetic model_. we have resorted to a simple approximation that avoids the difficulties of the effective markovian approximation in @xcite introduced with the idea that for @xmath60 , the non  gaussian noise will only slightly depart from the gaussian one , and its effect being only a correction to the gaussian behavior . the resulting eq .",
    "( [ eq:12 ] ) shows some of the right tendencies with @xmath61 or @xmath3 , although some features observed in the simulations ( crossing of the transition lines and slight dependence of the linear slope for large @xmath11 ) are not reproduced by the simplified theoretical treatment .",
    "in addition , the stationary probability density function defined in eqs.([eq:10 ] ) and ( [ eq:11 ] ) clearly shows , for constant values of @xmath10 and @xmath57 and as a function of @xmath0 , the transition from unimodal to bimodal behavior .",
    "again , these general results and tendencies , together with the reentrance effect , have been confirmed by extensive numerical simulations as shown in figures 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "however , the agreement between theory and simulations is only qualitative , as the first are unable to reproduce some of the details revealed by the second .",
    "for instance , from the numerical simulations a more complex behavior of the transition line for large @xmath57 is apparent , while it is not present in the theoretical predictions ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    these results are in the same line that a series of previous studies on noise induced phenomena where the noise source was non  gaussian . in all the cases",
    ", we have found that the response of the system results to be enhanced or to have a strong dependence for values of the parameter @xmath0 corresponding to a departure from gaussian behavior . some of such studies , including stochastic resonance @xcite , gated traps @xcite , brownian motors @xcite , have been reviewed in @xcite .",
    "even though our results are so far only preliminary and further studies are required , we expect that the phenomenon discussed here will have remarkable effects on the noise induced phase transitions @xcite as well as in the problem of coupled ratchets @xcite .",
    "for instance , we can expect changes in the phase diagram of the first , or in the hysteresis cycle of the second , that could have interesting consequences in technological applications .",
    "such studies will be the subject of further work .",

    "in order to test our theoretical predictions , we have resorted to numerical simulations of the system indicated by eqs .",
    "( [ genic ] ) and ( [ nu1],[potential ] ) . for the numerical integration of those equations",
