    "an outstanding feature of the nonlinear interaction of two or more acoustic waves is a generation of secondary waves having different frequencies , namely harmonics , sum- and difference - frequency  @xcite . in the presence of an inclusion ,",
    "this generation is enhanced by two physical effects .",
    "first of all , the incident waves produce a radiation force through nonlinear interactions with the inclusion  @xcite . as a result",
    ", the inclusion is set in motion emitting waves which frequencies correspond to the components present in the dynamic radiation force .",
    "in addition , the primary waves ( incident and scattered ) related to the fundamental frequencies interact yielding secondary waves .",
    "this process is also known as scattering of sound - by - sound in which sum- and difference - frequency waves are generated  @xcite .",
    "difference - frequency generation is present in several applications like parametric array sonar  @xcite , audio spotlight  @xcite , characterization of liquid - vapor phase - transition  @xcite , and acoustical imaging methods such as nonlinear parameter tomography  @xcite and vibro - acoustography  @xcite .",
    "moreover , parametric arrays have been used to produce low - frequency waves in wideband scattering experiments  @xcite . in this case , the scatterer is placed outside the interaction region of the incident waves and the scattering is treated through the linear scattering theory .",
    "this is similar to calibrating parametric sonars based on measurements of the linear scattering cross - section  @xcite .",
    "investigations of difference- and sum - frequency generation concerning to spherical and cylindrical scattered waves were firstly performed by dean - iii  @xcite . scattering consisting of nonlinear interaction of a plane wave with a radially vibrating rigid cylinder  @xcite and sphere",
    "@xcite have also been analyzed .",
    "moreover , difference - frequency generation in scattering of two collinear plane waves by means of a sphere was previously studied  @xcite . however ,",
    "the results obtained in this study show that the difference - frequency scattered pressure has singularities in the polar angle of spherical coordinates ( i.e. the angle formed by the position vector and the @xmath3-axis ) .",
    "furthermore , the difference - frequency scattered pressure only depends on the monopole terms of the primary waves . giving this physical picture , a broader discussion is required on how to handle the singularities and why the information from higher - order multipole terms of the primary waves were discarded .",
    "applications of difference - frequency generation in acoustics generally employ incident beams which deviate from collinear plane waves .",
    "this has stimulated the investigation of nonlinear scattering of two acoustic waves with an arbitrary wavefront .",
    "our analysis stems from the westervelt wave equation  @xcite .",
    "this equation is solved through the method of successive approximations in addition to the green s function technique .",
    "furthermore , appropriate boundary conditions are established to garantee a unique solution of the westervelt equation .",
    "the difference - frequency scattered pressure is obtained as a partial - wave expansion which depends on beam - shape and scattering coefficients .",
    "each of these coefficients is related , respectively , to a complex amplitude of a partial - wave that composes the primary incident and scattered waves  @xcite .",
    "the method proposed here is applied to the nonlinear scattering of two intersecting plane waves by a rigid sphere .",
    "the difference - frequency scattered pressure is obtained in the farfield in three incident wave configurations : collinear , perpendicular , and counter - propagating . in this analysis ,",
    "the downshift ratio is larger than five .",
    "it is worthy to mention that the collinear configuration of incident waves has been implemented in vibro - acoustography experiments  @xcite , while the perpendicular and counter - propagating arrangements have been experimentally studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , respectively . to reduce the mathematical complexity of the model ,",
    "the incident waves are assumed to be spatially located in a spherical region . even though this approach is not entirely realistic ,",
    "experimental accomplishment of scattering of two located intersecting ultrasound beams was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the results show that in the collinear case , the nonlinear interaction involving the primary incident waves ( incident - with - incident interaction ) and that of the primary scattered waves ( scattered - with - scattered interaction ) are responsible for difference - frequency generation . in the perpendicular and counter - propagating configurations , difference - frequency generation is mostly due to the scattered - with - scattered interaction .",
    "in addition , the difference - frequency scattered pressure increases with difference - frequency and varies with the radial distance @xmath2 from the scatterer to observation point as @xmath4 and @xmath1 .",
    "a similar result is found in ref .",

    "absorption effects of a viscous fluid can be readily included for longitudinal acoustic waves ( compressional waves ) . in this case , the wavenumber of a single - frequency wave becomes a complex number .",
    "however , the account for shear wave propagation , which is supported in viscous fluids , lies beyond the scope of this study .",
    "we are interested on describing how a difference - frequency wave is generated in a nonlinear scattering of two incident acoustic waves by means of a rigid sphere .",
    "the scope of this analysis is limited to acoustic pressures propagating in the farfield . up to second - order approximation",
    ", the farfield pressure satisfies the lossless westervelt wave equation  @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 , with @xmath12 being the thermodynamic nonlinear parameter of the fluid .",
    "this equation accounts for wave diffraction and medium nonlinearity .",
    "it is worthy to notice that eq .",
    "( [ westervelt ] ) is valid when cumulative effects ( such as wave distortion ) are dominant over nonlinear local effects .",
    "this happens when the propagating wave is far from acoustic sources .",
    "when the wave is observed near to a scatterer , its pressure should be modified to  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the velocity potential .",
    "note that the approximation @xmath15 holds for farfield waves .",
    "let us assume that the acoustic pressure is given in terms of the mach number @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( weak - amplitude waves ) , where @xmath18 is the maximum magnitude of the particle velocity in the medium .",
    "hence , we can expand the pressure up to second - order as  @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are , respectively , the linear ( primary ) and the second - order ( secondary ) pressure fields . in the weak - amplitude approximation ( @xmath22 ) , the primary and the secondary pressures suffice to describe nonlinear effects in wave propagation .",

    "when the scatterer is placed in the interaction region of the incident waves ( see fig .",

    "hence , the primary scattered pressure reads @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the dimensionless pressure amplitudes of the scattered waves .",
