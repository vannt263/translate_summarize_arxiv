    "we have recently started observing the sun with the giant meterwave radio telescope ( gmrt ) near pune , india .",
    "we report here the observation of an interesting flare - coronal mass ejection ( cme ) event on nov 17 2001 .",
    "the event was analyzed using data from the gmrt , the nobeyama radioheliograph ( norh ) and the hiraiso spectrograph ( hiras ) in japan , the radio solar telescope network ( rstn ) in australia , the mount wilson observatory in the usa and the michelson doppler imager ( mdi ) and large angle spectroscopic coronograph ( lasco ) onboard the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) .",
    "we give a brief description of the gmrt and the solar observing procedure in  2 , followed by a multiwavelength overview of the flare - cme event in  3 .",
    "we interpret the data in  4 and draw conclusions in  5 .",
    "the gmrt is located about 80 km north of the city of pune in maharashtra , western india ( latitude 19@xmath0n , longitude 74@xmath1e , altitude 650 meters ) .",
    "it consists of thirty 45 m diameter antennas spread over 25 km .",
    "half of these are in a compact , randomly distributed array of about 1 km and the rest are spread out in an approximate ` y ' configuration .",
    "the shortest baseline is 100 m and the longest is 26 km .",
    "gmrt currently operates in the frequency bands around 150 , 235 , 325 , 610 and 10001450 mhz .",
    "it is among the most sensitive telescopes in the world in these bands and also provides seconds of arc angular resolution ( ananthakrishnan & rao , 2002 ) .",
    "further details about the gmrt can be found at the url http://www.gmrt.ncra.tifr.res.in      these observations represent the first attempts at imaging the sun with the gmrt after most of the antennas had started functioning .",
    "our observing frequencies ranged from 1060 to 1076 mhz .",
    "there were 28 antennas working through the duration of the observations presented in this paper .",
    "we did not track the sun continuously during these observations .",
    "instead , we repositioned the antennas at the sun center every 30 minutes . within each 30 minute interval ,",
    "the phase center was allowed to drift .",
    "the data were then corrected for solar rotation during subsequent data analysis .",
    "we typically observed the sun for around 20 minutes and the phase calibrator ( 3c298 ) for 6 - 7 minutes in each 30 minute cycle .",
    "solar attenuators of 30 db were inserted while observing the sun and they were removed while recording data on the calibrator .",
    "since the gmrt antennas are not yet equipped with extra high noise calibrators ( which can generate noise corresponding to @xmath2 1 sfu ) we can not place much confidence in the absolute values of flux observed at this time .",
    "we therefore normalized the fluxes we observed to the peak flux observed by the nobeyama radio polarimeter ( norp ) at 1 ghz ( http://solar.nro.nao.ac.jp/norp/html/daily/ ) .",
    "since the automatic gain control ( agc ) circuits were on throughout the duration of the observations , the flux at the final peak of the flare is somewhat supressed relative to the preceding smaller peaks ( see figure 8) .",
    "we used an integration time of 16 seconds ; this is therefore the minimum time cadence with which we can obtain snapshot images for this observation . in principle",
    ", it is possible to go down to an integration time as low as 2 seconds but no lower , because the time constant of the agc circuits is of the order of 1 second .",
    "the data were processed using the standard nrao / aips software .",
    "snapshot images , with a dynamic range of @xmath310 , of the flaring region were obtained every 16 seconds using a restoring beam size of 34@xmath4 24@xmath5 in right ascension and declination respectively .",
    "a long duration m2.8 flare was observed on 17 nov .",
    "2001 at 1060 mhz with the gmrt .",
    "the x - ray flare which originated in noaa active region 9704 ( s18e41 ) , started at 04:49 ut , showed a smooth rise ,    peaked at 05:25 ut and exhibited a long decay period before ending at 06:11 ut .",
    "the x - ray fluxes observed by goes 10 in the 1 - 8 @xmath6 and 0.5 - 4 @xmath6 bands are shown in figure 1 .",
    "figure 2 shows the mdi longitudinal magnetogram of ar 9704 ( left panel ) and the mount wilson    sunspot drawing for this region ( right panel ) .",
    "an examination of the longitudinal magnetogram shows that it is clearly more complex than a simple bipole .",
    "the central black polarity spot is sandwiched by white polarities to its northwest and southeast , suggesting the existence of at least two sets of loop systems .",
    "this active region was classified as a @xmath7 configuration by the solar geophysical data reports on nov 17 2001 , but its complexity was upgraded to @xmath8 on nov 19 2003 , when it had rotated closer to disk center .",
    "the mount wilson sunspot drawing on nov 17 2003 assigns a @xmath8 category to this active region . notwithstanding the disparity between the classifications of ar 9704 on nov 17 2003 , the magnetogram and the sunspot drawing provide sufficient evidence for the magnetic complexity of ar 9704 .",
    "the 1060 mhz gmrt images , described later , ( see figure 9 ) show evidence for two sets of loop systems in this region , providing additional evidence for its complexity .",
    "the flare was accompanied by a fast halo ( @xmath2 1500 km / s ) cme that first appeared in the c2 field of view of lasco at around 05:30 ut ( http://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/cme@xmath9list ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the lightcurve of the 17 and 34 ghz emission from the norh and a representative 17 ghz image    from the norh that shows the erupting prominence . the bright on - disk emission at 17 ghz evident in fig .  3",
    "is centered at around s18e40 .",
    "the 17 ghz emission shows a characteristically gradual rise and decay , indicating that it is thermal in nature at these frequencies . on the other hand , the impulsive nature of the 200 , 410 , 500 and 1060 mhz lightcurves ( see figures 68 ) is evidence of their nonthermal nature .",
    "the 10 minute cadence movie of the 17 ghz data for this event available on the nobeyama webpage ( see figure 3 ) suggests that the prominence started lifting off sometime between 04:45 ut and 04:55 ut . a detailed analysis of the prominence eruption associated with this event by kundu et al .",
    "( 2003 ) establishes that the rapid phase of the prominence liftoff started at around 04:48 ut .",
    "figure 4 shows dynamic spectrum of the event from the hiraiso spectrograph .",
    "the spectrum shows    drifting continuum emission starting at @xmath2 04:35 ut at @xmath2 200 mhz and drifting downwards in frequency .",
    "the lower envelope of this drifting continuum emission represents the upper end of a feature that is drifting upward in the solar corona .",
    "the hiras dynamic spectrum did not have data below 50 mhz for this event .",
    "we were therefore able to follow the lower envelope of the drifting continuum only until @xmath2 04:50 ut .",
    "an approximate curve was fitted to the lower envelope of the drifting continuum . using the formulae given by aschwanden & benz ( 1995 ) ,",
    "the frequency of emission was related to its height in the solar atmosphere assuming that the observed radiation is emitted at the fundamental plasma frequency .",
    "figure 5 shows the results of these computations .",
    "it shows the upward    motion of the feature represented by the lower envelope of the drifting continuum ( evident in figure 4 ) through the solar corona .",
    "in contrast to the slow rise and fall in the 17 and 34 ghz light curves , the light curves at 200 , 410 , 500 and 1060 mhz show an impulsive nature .",
    "in fact , the 200 mhz emission is the first sign of non thermal activity associated with this event .",
    "figure 6 shows fixed frequency lightcurves at 200 mhz ( lower panel ) and 500 mhz ( upper panel ) from the hiraiso spectrograph while figure 7 shows the fixed frequency light curve at 410 mhz from the radio solar telescope network ( rstn ) telescope at learmonth , australia .",
    "the emission at 200 mhz starts rising at around 04:22 ut while that at 500 mhz starts rising at around 04:50 ut .",
    "figure 8 shows the 1060 mhz light curve derived from the gmrt observations .",
    "this emission has three distinct peaks .",
    "the largest peak of the gmrt 1060 mhz lightcurve is normalized to the largest peak of the 1 ghz lightcurve from the norp ( http://solar.nro.nao.ac.jp/norp/html/daily/ ) .",
    "the general shape of the gmrt 1060 mhz lightcurve is very similar to the norp 1 ghz lightcurve .",
    "however , the third and largest peak in the gmrt 1060 mhz data is suppressed relative to the first two peaks , since the agc circuits were on during the observation . as a result , the ratios peak1/peak3 and peak2/peak3 from the gmrt 1060 mhz lightcurve are around 50% larger than the corresponding ratios obtained from the norp 1 ghz lightcurve .",
    "figure 9 shows 16 s snapshots of the 1060 mhz emission observed with the    gmrt .",
    "the images are centered at s15e46 , with a field of view of 500@xmath10 500@xmath11 .",
    "the first peak of the 1060 mhz gmrt lightcurve near 04:52 ut is associated with the brightening of a banana - shaped ns oriented structure near the center of the field of view of the images .",
    "the second peak near 05:18 ut is also associated with the brightening of the same structure .",
    "the third and strongest peak , at around 05:32 ut , corresponds to a brightening of a ne - sw oriented source to the south of the banana. the brightness temperature of the radiation at each of these three peaks is @xmath12k , indicating its nonthermal nature .",
    "figure 10 shows 16 s snapshot images near the rising edge of the first peak .",
    "the images clearly show that the first peak of the 1060 mhz emission occured at around 04:48 ut .",
    "the 1060 mhz gmrt images reveal the existence of at least two sets of loop systems ( n - s and ne - sw ) .",
    "together with the magnetograms and sunspot drawing ( see figure 2 ) , this provides concrete evidence for the complexity of the magnetic fields in the region from which the flare and cme were initiated .",
    "[ cols=\"^,<,^,^,^ \" , ]     table 1 shows the time sequence of events leading to , and after the cme - flare initiation , with emphasis on the nonthermal emission .",
    "the third and fourth columns show the estimated height in @xmath13 from which the corresponding phenomenon is believed to be emanating .",
    "we employ the model of aschwanden & benz ( 1995 ) in calculating these heights .",
    "the third column shows the height assuming that the radio emission emanates at the fundamental plasma frequency ( s=1 ) while the height in the fourth column is calculated assuming that the radio emission emanates at the first harmonic of the plasma frequency ( s=2 ) . a comparison of different models for estimating the height in the corona from which such radio emission emanates shows that the uncertainties in the height estimates can range from 5 to 10% ( mann et al .",
    "the difference between the heights quoted in the third and fourth columns is relevant only for the nonthermal radio emission at 200 , 500 and 1060 mhz .",
    "masuda et al . ( 1994 ) estimate that the hard x - ray emission at the top of the flaring loop originates at a height of around 18,000 km .",
    "we have used this number as a rough estimate of the height at which the hard x - ray flare ( lower curve , figure 1 ) originates .",
    "the fifth column gives the start time of the phenomenon , as evident from the corresponding lightcurve .",
    "we surmise that the nonthermal emission is a signature of magnetic reconnection , which provides sites for particle acceleration and consequent nonthermal emission .",
    "the start of nonthermal emission at a particular frequency therefore signals the start of reconnection processes at the height corresponding to that frequency .",
    "the first sign of nonthermal activity associated with this event is the 200 mhz nonthermal emission quoted in item a ( table 1 ) .",
    "detailed measurements of the trajectory of the prominence eruption associated with this event made by kundu et al .",
    "( 2003 ) using 17 ghz data from the norh reveal that the prominence is at @xmath2 1.07 r@xmath14 at 04:22 ut . the 200 mhz nonthermal emission peak of item a ( table 1 ) occurs at 1.08 ( s=1 ) or 1.14 r@xmath14 ( s=2 ) , which is clearly above the prominence .",
    "this could be consistent with the predictions of the breakout model for solar eruptions ( antiochos et al .",
    "1999 ) , in which the first signature of eruption is the null point reconnection above the central arcade which is going to erupt . according to this model , the central arcade rises slowly during the initial buildup stage , due to shearing at its footpoints , pushing the overlying constraining field lines and distorting the x - type null point ( above the central arcade ) . beyond a certain point ,",
    "the current layer at the overlying null point becomes sufficiently thin so that ideal mhd evolution is no longer possible and reconnection sets in , so that the overlying constraining field lines connect to adjoining arcades .",
    "the measurements of kundu et al .",
    "( 2003 ) however reveal that the prominence had started rising well before 04:22 ut , the time at which the 200 mhz nonthermal emission peak of item a ( table 1 ) occurs .",
    "this could be because the evolution of the null point above the central arcade prior to 04:22 ut was ideal , since the current layer was not thin enough for reconnection to set in .",
    "however , this does remain an open question .",
    "as mentioned earlier , it should also be borne in mind that there could be an uncertainty of the order of 5 - 10% in the estimate of the height from which the 200 mhz emission originates . the uncertainty in the projected position of the filament in the 17 ghz images used by kundu et al .",
    "( 2003 ) is much smaller ; it is of the order of 1 beam , which is around 15 arcseconds or 0.01 r@xmath14 .",
    "the next noteworthy feature evident from table 1 is the near - simultaneity of items b , c , d , e , f and g. the 200 , 410 , 500 and 1060 mhz lightcurves exhibit peaks between @xmath2 04:48  04:50 ut . the x - ray flare and the prominence eruption also take place in this time interval",
    ". measurements of the prominence trajectory by kundu et al .",
    "( 2003 ) using norh 17 ghz data show that items b ",
    "g ( table 1 ) occur well below the prominence .",
    "the near - simultaneous nonthermal emission at heights ranging from 1.02 to 1.18 r@xmath14 could thus arise from a vertical current sheet below the erupting arcade . during this time interval",
    ", the lower envelope of the drifting continuum in the hiras dynamic spectrum ( see figures 4 and 5 ) could represent the top of this vertical current sheet .",
    "the velocity of this feature increases abruptly at around 04:48 ut ( right panel of figure 5 ) , as is evident from the increase in the curvature of the lower envelope of the drifting continuum around 04:48 ut ( figure 4 ) .",
    "this could be taken to mean that the top of the vertical current sheet accelerates upward around this time .",
    "our observations thus indicate that , during the interval 04:48  04:50 ut :    1 .   a vertical current sheet spanning at least 1.02 to 1.18 r@xmath14 exists ( items b  g , table 1 ) + 2 .",
    "the top of the current sheet accelerates upward ( figure 5 , right panel ) + 3 .   the prominence eruption and x - ray flare occur +    the formation of a vertical current sheet under the erupting arcade is a feature of several flux rope models for cme initiation ( e.g. , forbes 1991 ; lin & forbes 2000 ; mikic & linker 1994 ; amari et al .",
    "reconnection at the vertical current sheet allows the eruption to proceed in these flux rope models .",
    "the height of the flux rope undergoes a sudden jump as a result of the ( equally sudden ) formation of a current sheet underneath it ( lin et al .",
    "1998 ; forbes 2000 ) .",
    "the formation of a vertical current sheet underneath the erupting arcade is also a feature of the breakout model , although it is a secondary process not integral to the breakout per se ( antiochos et al .",
    "1999 ; klimchuk 2000 ) . in the breakout model , reconnection in the vertical current sheet results in an increase in the speed of the eruption .",
    "the strong heating associated with this current sheet reconnection is manifested as the x - ray flare .",
    "items h , i and j ( table 1 ) are post - eruptive phenomena . in particular , the 1060 mhz emission from the ne - sw oriented gmrt source ( item j ) is most likely caused by flare accelerated electrons trapped in the ne - sw oriented loop system .",
    "this is manifested as type iv - like decimetric continuum emission on the hiraiso dynamic spectrum .",
    "we have presented some of the first gmrt observations of a solar eruption .",
    "we have used gmrt observations at 1060 mhz in conjunction with data from the norh , the hiraiso solar observatory and lasco to investigate the onset mechanism of a flare - cme event on nov 17 2001 .",
    "we find evidence for reconnection above the erupting arcade that could be construed as evidence in favor of the magnetic breakout model .",
    "we find evidence for the formation of a vertical current sheet below the erupting prominence .",
    "an abrupt increase in the velocity of the top of the vertical current sheet is acompanied by the m2.8 x - ray flare and the prominence eruption .",
    "the features associated with the formation of the vertical current sheet are consistent with the predictions of several variants of flux rope cme initiation models , as well as the magnetic breakout model .",
