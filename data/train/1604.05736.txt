    "in recent years , the study of far - from - equilibrium dynamics of correlated quantum systems has been attracting much attention  @xcite , significantly sparked by the dramatic development of experimental devices combining long coherence times , slow dynamics , and precise control of parameters .",
    "they include ultracold atoms  @xcite , artificial ion crystals  @xcite , electronic circuits  @xcite , spin chains in organic conductors  @xcite , and quantum photonic systems  @xcite . in ultracold - atom systems for instance ,",
    "major assets are the possibility to engineer out - of - equilibrium initial states and dynamically change some microscopic parameter(s ) of the system .",
    "the study of the system dynamics after such a _ quantum quench _ now makes it possible to address a variety of open basic questions with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "so far , it paved the way to observation of undamped oscillations in integrable one - dimensional systems  @xcite , ballistic cone spreading of quantum correlations  @xcite , thermalization effects  @xcite , nucleation of kibble - zurek solitons  @xcite , and supercurrents in bose superfluids  @xcite , for instance .",
    "universal properties of the time evolution of local observables following a quantum quench mainly relies on so - called _ lieb - robinson bounds_. for lattice systems with short - range interactions , the correlation function of any set of two local observables can be activated only after some finite time @xmath9 , which increases linearly with the distance @xmath10 between the supports of the two observables  @xcite .",
    "this provides an upper bound to the spreading velocity of correlations .",
    "it corresponds to a cone in space - time representation , which defines a _",
    "causal region_. in many cases , the known bounds provide a fair account of the actual spreading of correlations for short - range interactions .",
    "ballistic ( linear cone ) behavior has now been found in several analytical  @xcite , numerical  @xcite , and experimental  @xcite works .",
    "the extension of the lieb - robinson bounds to quantum systems with long - range interactions is a major challenge , with possible applications to a variety of systems , including artificial ion crystals  @xcite , polar molecules  @xcite , magnetic atoms  @xcite , and rydberg atoms  @xcite .",
    "an important step forward in the understanding of the dynamics of lattice systems with two - body long - range interactions of the form @xmath0 was made with the identification of logarithmic lieb - robinson - like bounds , @xmath11 , for strong - enough decay of interactions , @xmath12 .",
    "it was further shown that for @xmath13 , the bounds can be made more stringent in the form of a polynomial - shaped horizon , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 smoothly converges to @xmath16 ( linear cone ) for @xmath17  @xcite . in turn , for @xmath3 , finite - size bounds have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "however , no bound is known in the thermodynamic limit , which suggests possible instantaneous activation of correlations at arbitrary distance , and correspondingly , the breaking of causality . numerical work confirmed the breaking of causality in one - dimensional lattice spin models for @xmath18  @xcite and further pointed out significant dependence to the initial state and model  @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with experimental observations in artificial ion chains  @xcite .",
    "moreover , for @xmath19 , the numerics showed that the propagation is significantly slower than the known bounds  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , it was found to be sub - ballistic for @xmath20 and ballistic for @xmath21 .",
    "finally , non universal behavior was found in certain systems .",
    "for instance , in the extended one - dimensional bose - hubbard  @xcite , fermionic kitaev  @xcite , and free - fermion  @xcite chains with long - range interactions , clear ballistic spreading was found irrespective to the interaction exponent @xmath5 , which corresponds to efficient dynamical protection of causality in these systems .    in view of this rich behavior ,",
    "analyzing exactly - solvable systems is thus of utmost importance to determine the precise dynamics of quantum correlations beyond mathematically - exact bounds , which are not guaranteed to be saturated . in this respect ,",
    "quadratic hamiltonians play a central role .",
    "for instance , quadratic approximations have been studied for one - dimensional spin  @xcite , bose  @xcite , and fermi  @xcite systems . in the present work ,",
    "we consider quadratic bose systems in arbitrary lattice dimension @xmath1 , hence generalizing previous results to dimensions higher than one .",
    "we develop the general theory of correlation dynamics for bose systems undergoing an instantaneous quantum quench between two quadratic hamiltonians with both short- and long - range interactions of the form @xmath0 .",
    "we provide the equations for the time evolution of a generic correlation function , which can be easily generalized to more complicated cases .",
    "then we study the first- and second - order divergences of the energy spectrum as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath1 , and precisely relate them to the dynamical behavior of the correlations by computing analytically the dominant contributions . for strong decay of interactions , @xmath2 ,",
    "the group velocity of the quasi - particle excitations is bounded , which yields a linear conic causal region .",
    "this behavior is similar to that found for short - range interactions and corresponds to a dynamics significantly slower than the known bounds  @xcite . for weak decay of interactions , @xmath3 ,",
    "the energy spectrum diverges in the infrared limit .",
    "it provides a vanishing characteristic time , independent of the distance @xmath10 , for the activation of correlations .",
    "the latter can be associated with instantaneous propagation of correlations and the breakdown of causality .",
    "this is compatible with the absence of known finite bound in this regime .",
    "finite - size scaling of the typical times precisely confirms this behavior . for intermediate decay of interactions , @xmath4",
    ", we find a bent - cone causal region determined by a sub - ballistic algebraic bound , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is some function of the exponent @xmath5 and the dimension @xmath1 .",
    "this again corresponds to a dynamics that is significantly slower than the known bounds .",
    "furthermore , we study the specific long - range transverse ising model in dimensions @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 in the ( quadratic ) spin - wave approximation .",
    "we study the full space - time dynamics of the spin - spin correlations for various values of @xmath5 . taking into account the contributions of all quasi - particles , we confirm the three regimes .",
    "we then characterize each regime in detail . for @xmath3 , we perform finite - size scaling of the correlation function , which confirms our analytical predictions for both the bound and the amplitude of the correlations at the propagation front , and the breaking of causality . for @xmath2 , we find a clear linear cone .",
    "we determine the associated velocity and find excellent agreement with the excepted value of twice the maximum group velocity  @xcite . for @xmath4 , we find a clear algebraic bound , @xmath14 for all tested cases and extract numerically the exponent @xmath22 in dimensions @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
