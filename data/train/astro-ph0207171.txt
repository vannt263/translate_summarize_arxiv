    "theories of the origin of x - ray emission in massive stars are now being reexamined in light of new discoveries by the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ observatories . traditionally , the x - ray emission of _ single _ ob and wolf - rayet ( w - r ) stars without companions has been attributed to shocks distributed throughout their winds that form as a result of line - driven flow instabilities ( lucy & white 1980 ; lucy 1982 ; baum et al . 1992 ; gayley & owocki 1995 ; feldmeier et al . 1997 ; owocki , castor , & rybicki 1988 ) .",
    "such emission is predicted to be relatively soft ( kt @xmath9 1 kev ) and x - ray emission lines formed in an optically thick outflowing wind are expected to be blueshifted and asymmetric due to higher attenuation of the redward portion of the line by receding material on the far side of the star ( macfarlane et al .",
    "1991 ; owocki & cohen 2001 ) .",
    "recently obtained x - ray grating spectra of several ob stars reveal properties that conflict with the predictions of traditional radiative wind shock theory . in particular , the emission lines of the o9 supergiant @xmath10 ori ( waldron & cassinelli 2000 ) and the b0v star @xmath11 sco ( cohen et al . 2002 ) are unshifted and show no obvious asymmetries .",
    "the lack of asymmetries is difficult to explain if the lines are indeed formed in shocked winds ( owocki & cohen 2001 ) .",
    "also puzzling is the presence of narrow high - temperature fe xxiii and fe xxiv lines in @xmath11 sco indicative of hot plasma well in excess of @xmath121 kev .",
    "in contrast , much - needed support for the radiative wind shock paradigm has been received from _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ grating observations of the o4 supergiant @xmath10 puppis , whose emission lines are blueshifted and asymmetric ( cassinelli et al .",
    "2001 ; kahn et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "although grating observations are providing stringent tests of wind shock theories in ob stars , the observational picture for w - r stars is much less complete due to the lack of suitable targets bright enough for x - ray grating observations . at current sensitivity levels , grating spectra of sufficient quality for emission line analysis",
    "can only be obtained for a few of the brightest w - r @xmath13 ob binary systems such as @xmath14 velorum ( skinner et al .",
    "2001 ; dumm et al .",
    "such binaries provide crucial information on extrastellar emission from colliding wind shocks between the stars ( cherepashchuk 1976 ; prilutskii & usov 1976 ; usov 1992 ) , but this emission is difficult to decouple from any intrinsic stellar emission that may be present since the binary components are usually not spatially resolved in x - rays .",
    "we are thus undertaking an observing program using _ xmm - newton _ aimed at acquiring moderate resolution ccd spectra of fainter w - r stars that are currently beyond the reach of gratings .",
    "these include high - interest objects such as the putatively single wn5 - 6 star wr 110 ( skinner et al .",
    "2002 , hereafter szgs02 ) and possible binary systems such as ez cma discussed here .",
    "the large effective area of _ xmm - newton _ is particularly well - suited for obtaining good - quality ccd spectra of such fainter objects in reasonable exposure times .",
    "although ccd spectra do not provide the detailed information on line widths and profiles that can only be obtained with gratings , they are capable of discerning stronger emission lines and provide meaningful constraints on x - ray absorption and the overall distribution of plasma with temperature . such information is more than adequate to discriminate between the relatively cool emission ( kt @xmath9 1 kev ) that is expected from filamentary shocks distributed throughout the wind and harder emission at several kev that is predicted for colliding wind binaries .",
    "as such , ccd spectra provide an ideal means for identifying candidate colliding wind binaries that may be amenable to study at higher spectral resolution with next - generation x - ray telescopes .",
    "we present here new _",
    "xmm - newton _ and _ vla _ observations of the nitrogen - type w - r star ez cma (= hd 50896 = wr6 ) .",
    "this wn4 star has been extensively studied at all wavelengths and shows optical and ultraviolet variability at a well - documented 3.765 day optical period , the origin of which is still not understood .",
    "various explanations have been proposed including an as yet undetected companion ( firmani et al .",
    "1980 ; lamontagne , moffat & lamarre 1986 ; georgiev et al .",
    "1999 ) and a rotationally modulated wind ( st .- louis et al .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ observations provide broader energy coverage and higher signal - to - noise ( s / n ) spectra than in previous observations , giving more accurate measurements of the x - ray absorption and plasma temperature distribution for comparison with emission models .",

    "data yield the first reliable determination of the radio spectral index based on single - epoch multifrequency data .",

    "the hard - band emission is also seen in the pn image , which shows 41 net counts ( s / n = 5.8 ) in the 5 - 10 kev range .",

    "light curves in soft and hard - bands were also generated and showed similar statistics .",
    "for example , the pn light curve in the 2.5 - 8.0 kev band gave p(const ) = 0.78 ( @xmath27/dof = 4.75/8 ) when binned at 800 s intervals ( @xmath720 cts / bin ) .    in summary",

    "this represents a 24% decrease , some of which could be due to absolute flux calibration differences between _ xmm - newton _ and _ asca_. thus , any real variability is within the day - to - day fluctuation range of @xmath1530% found in previous _ rosat _",

    "we conclude that the best fit is obtained with an absorbed two - temperature optically thin plasma model ( 2 t vapec ) using nonsolar abundances ( sec .",
    "isothermal models are unacceptable .",
    "the best - fit parameters for the 2 t vapec model are given in table 3 , and an overlay of this model on the mos1 spectrum is shown in figure 4 .",
    "the emission measure is dominated by a cool component at kt@xmath6 @xmath7 0.6 kev , but hotter emission is also present . assuming that the hotter emission is thermal , its derived temperature is kt@xmath8 = 3.5 [ 3.0 - 4.2 ] kev , where brackets enclose the 90% confidence interval .",
    "about one - half of the observed ( absorbed ) flux is due to the hot component ( table 3 ) . as shown in figure 5 ,",
    "essentially all of the flux above 2.5 kev is due to the hot component . for comparison ,",
    "we have also fitted the _ asca _ sis0 spectrum obtained in october 1995 with the 2 t vapec model .",
    "very similar results were obtained and the best - fit values of n@xmath33 , kt@xmath6 , and kt@xmath8 all lie within the 90% confindence ranges determined from _ xmm - newton _ spectra ( table 3 ) .",
    "because of the rather high temperature of the hot component and the low s / n ratio above 4 kev , the hot component can also be modeled as bremsstrahlung or a power - law . replacing the hot optically thin plasma component in the 2 t vapec model with a bremss model in xspec",
    "gives kt@xmath34 = 3.4 [ 3.0 - 4.1 ] kev and no change in the reduced @xmath27 .",
    "thus , a bremsstrahlung model for the hard component is essentially identical to an optically thin plasma model as expected at these higher temperatures . if a power - law model with an energy dependence e@xmath35 is used for the hot component then the best - fit photon power - law index is @xmath36 = 2.5 and the reduced @xmath27 increases by 1.6% over the 2 t vapec value .",
    "issues related to power - law models were discussed in szgs02 and also apply here .",
    "the presence of a cool and hot emission component is confirmed in the emission measure distribution derived from a fit to all three spectra with the c6pvmkl model , as shown in figure 6 .",
    "the cool dem component has a maximum contribution at kt@xmath6 @xmath7 0.55 kev , in good agreement with 2 t models .",
    "the dem also shows a turnup above @xmath124 kev signalling hotter plasma .",
    "however , the precise temperature of the hot component can not be reliably determined from dem models due to low signal - to - noise above 4 kev .",
    "some soft emission below 0.5 kev appears to be present in the pn spectrum ( fig .",
    "3 ) , but is not as obvious in the mos spectra ( fig .",
    "4 ) . pn images in the soft 0.2 - 0.5 kev range show unresolved emission at the stellar position but there is no indication of extended emission from the surrounding ring nebula s 308 , in agreement with _ rosat",

    "10@xmath37 @xmath31 underestimates the flux in the pn spectrum by about 20% ( @xmath231.8@xmath26 ) in the 0.3 - 0.43 kev range ( see also fig . 4 of ws96 )",
    ". however , this model provides a satisfactory mos fit at 0.4 kev .",
    "the soft residual in the pn fit can be removed by adding a third optically thin plasma component to the 2 t vapec model at an uncertain temperature kt@xmath38 @xmath9 0.3 kev viewed under low ( @xmath7interstellar ) absorption n@xmath33(ism ) @xmath7 5 @xmath2 10@xmath39 @xmath31 .",
    "thus , there could be a contribution at low energies from very soft emission which would most likely originate far out in the wind .",
    "but , we are unable to state with confidence that such very soft emission is present because of pn calibration uncertainties below 0.5 kev and the reduced sensitivity to soft emission that results from use of the thick optical blocking filter .",
    "+      we are unable to obtain satisfactory spectral fits using either solar abundances ( anders & grevesse 1989 , hereafter ag89 ) or the wn abundances given in table 1 of van der hucht , cassinelli , & williams 1986 ( vcw86 ) .",
    "an absorbed 2 t vapec model using solar abundances gives @xmath27/dof = 465.5/223 = 2.09 and the same model with wn abundances gives @xmath27/dof = 383.4/223 = 1.72 .",
    "although neither fit is acceptable , the wn abundances yield somewhat better results and we have thus used them as our reference for further variable abundance fitting .",
    "these canonical wn abundances reflect chemical composition changes that are thought to occur in wn stars as a result of advanced nucleosynthesis including hydrogen depletion and the enhancment of helium and nitrogen ( willis 1996 ) .",
    "the spectral fits are significantly improved by allowing the abundances of n , ne , mg , si , s , and fe to vary relative to the vcw86 values .",
    "also , the fit to the weak feature near 3.15 kev can be improved by adding ar to the canonical wn abundance table and letting it vary .",
    "this weak feature could be ar xvii , but the s xvi line at 3.11 kev may also be contributing .",
    "a comparison of 2 t vapec and c6pvmkl models suggests that fe is underabundant in ez cma by about a factor of four relative to the values in vcw86 ( even when ne is also allowed to vary ) and that s is overabundant .",
    "specifically , 2 t vapec fits give fe = 0.23 [ 0.15 - 0.32 ] and s = 2.0 [ 1.4 - 2.9 ] relative to the vcw86 values , which are by number : fe / h = 1.904 @xmath2 10@xmath40 and s / h = 7.600 @xmath2 10@xmath41 .",
    "similar values are obtained with a 2 t vmekal optically thin plasma model . if cosmic abundances ( ag89 ) are used as a reference then the underabundance of fe persists .",
    "acceptable fits give an equivalent neutral hydrogen column density n@xmath33 = 4.0 [ 3.4 - 4.4 ] @xmath2 10@xmath37 @xmath31 .",
    "this value corresponds to a visual extinction a@xmath42 = 1.8 [ 1.5 - 2 ] using the conversion of gorenstein ( 1975 ) , which is at least twice as large as the values a@xmath42 = 0.00 - 0.82 determined from optical studies ( van der hucht 2001 , hereafter vdh01 ) .",
    "however , if we adopt an absolute visual magnitude m@xmath42 = @xmath233.5 as typical for wn4 stars ( fig . 4 of vdh01 ) , @xmath43 = 6.94 ( vdh01 ) and the _ hipparcos _ distance of 575 pc , then we obtain a@xmath42 = 1.64 , which is in good agreement with the value obtained above from the x - ray spectra .",
    "thus , the larger a@xmath42 determined from x - ray spectra is not unrealistic but two factors should be kept in mind .",
    "first , a typical value of m@xmath42 is difficult to define for wn stars since there is no definite relation between spectral type and bolometric luminosity .",

    "the source is unresolved down to the smallest synthesized beamsize of 0.@xmath224 @xmath2 0.@xmath223 as indicated by the good agreement between the peak and total fluxes .",
    "the total flux at 4.86 ghz is nearly identical to the value s@xmath45 = 1.05 @xmath1 0.08 mjy measured in 1980 - 1983 with the vla ( hogg 1989 ) .",

    "as shown in figure 6 , the total fluxes are well - approximated by a power - law of the form s@xmath47",

    "this spectral index agrees very well with that expected for free - free emission from a spherical ionized constant - velocity wind ( wright & barlow 1975 ) .",

    "similar arguments against a black hole companion based on _ asca _ luminosities were given by skinner et al .",

    "the _ xmm - newton _ results confirm the above luminosity deficit , giving an unabsorbed luminosity l@xmath29 = ( 0.2 - 10 kev ) = 3.46 @xmath2 10@xmath82d@xmath83 ergs s@xmath5 . at the upper end of current distance estimates ,",

    "if only the contribution of the hard component is considered , then l@xmath85(0.2 - 10 kev ) = 10@xmath86 ergs s@xmath5 .",
    "thus , if a neutron star companion is present then some mechanism such as rapid rotation near breakup ( davidson & ostriker 1973 ) is needed to inhibit accretion .    the strong similarity between ez cma and wr 110 ( table 4 ) presents a new challenge for the compact companion hypothesis .",
    "wr 110 has so far shown no clear signs of binarity or periodic optical variability and has not previously been proposed as a candidate wr @xmath13 c system .",
    "if ez cma has a compact companion , then it is not clear why its x - ray and radio properties would so closely mimic those of another wn star for which evidence of a compact companion is lacking .",
    "an interpretation of the x - ray emission in terms of accretion onto a compact companion is questionable on the above grounds .",
    "however , it is more difficult to rule out a normal ( nondegenerate ) stellar companion .",
    "such a companion is expected to be much less massive than the w - r star given that the radial velocity variations reported by firmani et al .",
    "( 1980 ) are of low amplitude .",
    "arguments for binarity have recently been strengthened on the basis of long - term coherent optical variability seen in data sets spanning more than 15 years with a well - determined period p = 3.765 @xmath1 0.0001 days ( georgiev et al . 1999 ) .",
    "georgiev et al .",
    "have argued that if the optical variability is due to a stellar companion then it is most likely orbiting very close to ez cma near the base of the wind in order to explain variations in the n v lines .",
    "we show below that a close companion could account for the hard x - ray emission detected by _ xmm - newton_.    to constrain the separation , we assume that p = 3.765 d is an orbital period and that the companion mass is much less than that of the w - r star m@xmath87 @xmath7 16 m@xmath4 ( hamann & koesterke 1998 ) .",

    "( 1980 ) .",
    "we now assume that the hard x - ray component is produced by the w - r wind shocking onto the lower mass companion and that the w - r wind is dominant . in this case",
    "the contact surface is the surface of the companion star , as discussed in more detail by luo , mccray , & maclow ( 1990 ) . because of the close separation , radiative cooling may be important ( eq . [ 8 ] of stevens et al .",
    "1992 ; eq . [ 52 ] of usov 1992 ) .",
    "we thus consider both adiabatic and radiative shocks .",
    "the close separation also raises the question of whether hard x - rays could escape from the overlying w - r wind and be detected . as already noted ( sec .",
    "5.2 ) , the radius of optical depth unity at 4 kev is r@xmath75(4 kev ) @xmath7 0.3 au , so some absorption of the hard x - rays could occur .",
    "however , the absorption will depend critically on wind properties such as the clumping factor , and the actual value of r@xmath75 in a clumped wind would be less than that given above , which is based on the assumption of a spherical , homogeneous wind .",
    "thus , without more specific information on wind geometry and homogeneity the escape of hard x - rays ( @xmath124 kev ) from radii smaller than 0.3 au is not precluded .",
    "the inferred radius of the companion r@xmath79 is obtained by equating the unabsorbed luminosity of the hard component ( table 3 ) with the predicted shock luminosity , where the predicted shock luminosity is different in the adiabatic and radiative cases ( eqs . [ 79 ] , [ 80 ] of usov 1992 , respectively ) . using the mass loss parameters in sec .",
    "4.2.1 and the unabsorbed hard - component flux f@xmath89(0.2 - 10 kev ) = 7.8 @xmath2 10@xmath90 ergs @xmath31 s@xmath5 , the adiabatic case gives a@xmath88 = 0.20d@xmath91(r@xmath79/r@xmath4)@xmath92 .",

    "a similar calculation in the radiative case gives r@xmath79 @xmath7 0.12 - 0.16 r@xmath4 . in the above",
    ", we have used the luminosity in a specific energy range ( 0.2 - 10 kev ) as an approximation for the total x - ray luminosity integrated over all frequencies . in general , the luminosity within a specific bandpass will be less than the value over all frequencies so the derived values of r@xmath79 are in fact lower limits .",
    "the observed temperature kt@xmath8 @xmath7 3.5 [ 3.0 - 4.2 ] kev is also compatible with a shocked companion interpretation .",
    "the observed temperature derived from spectral fits is an average that includes contributions from the hottest shocked plasma at kt@xmath93 along the line - of - centers and cooler plasma downstream .",
    "thus , the observed value will in general be _ less _ than the maximum temperature .",
    "the difference between the observed temperature and kt@xmath93 will depend on several poorly known factors including wind chemical composition and the importance of radiative cooling . as a rough estimate , one expects an observed temperature kt",

    "thus , based on the rough approximation that the observed temperature should be @xmath70.8 kt@xmath93 , we would expect observed values in the range @xmath72.5 - 6 kev .",
    "the values measured from spectral fits are well within this range .",
    "we thus conclude that the x - ray luminosity and observed temperature of the hard component are compatible with the shocked companion hypothesis .",
    "if the companion mass is much less than that of the w - r star then the inferred companion radius is at least r@xmath79 @xmath7 0.2 - 0.6 r@xmath4 .",
    "this would correspond to a main - sequence ( ms ) m - type star , but clearly such a low mass star could not yet have reached the ms if it formed contemporaneously with the w - r star .",
    "thus , a pre - main - sequence ( pms ) companion would seem more likely .",
    "it may be relevant here that some w - r stars such as @xmath14 vel are now believed to be associated with pms objects ( pozzo et al .",
    "2000 ; skinner et al .",
    "if the putative companion is indeed a late - type star then interaction of the w - r wind with the companion s magnetic field would be an important factor to include in more detailed models .",
    "our analysis shows that the observed temperature of the hot component is somewhat less than that expected for an adiabatic shock if the wind has reached terminal speed .",
    "this could be an indication that radiative cooling is important and the adiabatic approximation is breaking down at close separation , or perhaps that the w - r wind has not reached terminal speed at the shock .",
    "radiative braking of the wr wind by the the companion star can also lead to lower x - ray temperatures than predicted by simple models ( gayley , owocki , & cranmer 1997 ) but this effect would be of little importance for a lower mass companion that is less luminous than the wr star .",
    "overall , the x - ray properties derived for ez cma using new _ xmm - newton _ data are in good agreement with previous _ asca _ results ( skinner et al .",
    "the improved signal - to - noise in _ xmm - newton _ spectra yields more accurate measurements of the x - ray absorption and plasma temperatures .",
    "the temperature of the dominant cool component is identical to that obtained with _",
    "asca _ , but the hot component temperature is revised upward by @xmath735% to kt@xmath8 @xmath7 3.5 [ 3.0 - 4.2 ] kev .",
    "the origin of the hotter plasma remains obscure , but neutron star accretion models are difficult to justify based on x - ray luminosity considerations and the close similarity between the x - ray and radio properties of ez cma and wr 110 , where the latter is _ not _ a candidate wr @xmath13 c system .",
    "we have argued that the hard x - rays could from the w - r wind shocking onto a normal low - mass stellar companion , but direct evidence for such a companion is still lacking . also , the failure to detect periodic x - ray variability with _ rosat _ is somewhat difficult to reconcile with a companion interpretation unless the orbital elements are not conducive to x - ray variability , as for example in a low eccentricity orbit .",
    "further broad - band searches for modulated x - ray emission might be worthwhile since _ rosat _ was not sensitive to emission above 2.5 kev .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ spectra show that about one - third of the observed flux emerges above 2.5 kev ( table 3 ) and essentially all of this is due to the hard component .    until conclusive evidence for binarity is found ,",
    "alternative models that are capable of producing hard x - rays in the absence of a companion should be explored .",
    "of particular interest are models that incorporate wind - magnetic field interactions since it has been proposed that the variability of ez cma may be due to corotating structures at or near the surface ( st .- louis et al .",
    "possible evidence for magnetic activity in the form of short - duration ( @xmath121 hr ) optical variability has also been reported ( duijsens et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ spectra also reveal two interesting anomalies that deserve further study .",
    "first , the absorption column density derived from _ xmm - newton _ spectra ( table 3 ) is comparable to _ einstein _ and _ asca _ values and leads to an estimate of a@xmath42 = 1.8 [ 1.5 - 2.0 ] that is at least twice as large as previous optical / uv determinations .",
    "this suggests that excess x - ray absorption could be present that is not seen in the optical / uv , possibly due to the surrounding ring nebula , or perhaps that a@xmath42 is slightly underestimated from optical / uv studies .",
    "second , the _ xmm - newton _ spectra indicate that wn abundances may be substantially different than assumed in earlier work .",
    "in particular , all spectral models examined here give a best - fit fe abundance that is a factor of @xmath124 below the reference value for wn stars given in vcw86 , and a similar depletion is noted when using cosmic abundances ( ag89 ) as a reference . some caution",
    "is advised since the low fe abundance was inferred from moderate resolution ccd spectra where line blending is present , but the repeatibility of this result across several different types of models does suggest that the underabundance is real .",
    "finally , the close similarities between ez cma and wr 110 apparent in table 4 and figure 8 represent a first step toward a unified observational picture of x - ray and radio emission in wn stars .",
    "these close similarities provide strong evidence that the physical mechanisms responsible for the x - ray and radio continuum emission in these two wn stars are identical , even though their optical properties are obviously different . if an unseen companion is responsible for the optical variability and hard x - ray emission in ez cma then the similarities in table 4 implicate an unseen companion in wr 110 as well .",
    "the properties of such a companion were derived in our previous analysis of wr 110 ( szgs02 ) but are not as tightly constrained as for ez cma since wr 110 has no known regular optical variability on which to base an estimate of the orbital period .",
    "other w - r stars which have so far shown no direct evidence for binarity but which could also harbor unseen companions are those with prominent x - ray emission such as the wn4 star wr1 ( hd 4004 ) .",

    "<S> binarity may be responsible but the existence of a companion has not been proven . </S>",
    "<S> the radio spectral energy distribution of ez cma determined from _ vla _ observations at five frequencies is in excellent agreement with predictions for free - free wind emission and the ionized mass - loss rate allowing for distance uncertainties is @xmath0 = 3.8 ( @xmath12.6 ) </S>",

    "<S> the ccd x - ray spectra show prominent si xiii and s xv emission lines and can be acceptably modeled as an absorbed multi - temperature optically thin plasma , confirming earlier _ asca _ results . </S>",
    "<S> nonsolar abundances are inferred with fe notably deficient . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray emission is dominated by cooler plasma at a temperature kt@xmath6 @xmath7 0.6 kev , but a harder component is also detected and the derived temperature is kt@xmath8 @xmath7 3.0 - 4.2 kev if the emission is thermal . </S>",
    "<S> this is too high to be explained by radiative wind shock models and the x - ray luminosity of the hard component is three orders of magnitude lower than expected for accretion onto a neutron star companion . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the hard emission could be produced by the wolf - rayet wind shocking onto a normal ( nondegenerate ) stellar companion at close separation . </S>",
    "<S> finally , using comparable data sets we demonstrate that the x - ray and radio properties of ez cma are strikingly similar to those of the wn5 - 6 star wr110 . </S>",
    "<S> this similarity points to common x - ray and radio emission processes in wn stars and discredits the idea that ez cma is anomalous within its class . </S>"
