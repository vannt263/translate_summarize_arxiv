    "drawing planar graphs is an important topic in graph theory , combinatorics , and in particular in graph drawing .",
    "the existence of straight - line drawings was independently proved by wagner @xcite , steinitz and rademacher @xcite , stein @xcite and fry @xcite .",
    "the stunning results of de fraysseix , pach and pollack @xcite and schnyder @xcite show that planar graphs admit straight - line grid drawings in quadratic area , which can be computed in linear time .",
    "a visibility representation is another way to draw a planar graph . here",
    "the vertices are drawn as horizontal bars , called _ vertex - segments _ , and two vertex - segments must see each other along a vertical line , called _ edge - segment _ , if there is an edge between the respective vertices .",
    "vertex- and edge - segments do not overlap except that an edge - segment begins and ends at the vertex - segments of its end vertices . for convenience ,",
    "we identify vertices and edges with their segments .",
    "otten and van wyck @xcite showed that every planar graph has a visibility representation , and a linear time algorithm for constructing it was given independently by rosenstiehl and tarjan @xcite and by tamassia and tollis @xcite .",
    "their algorithm uses a grid of size at most @xmath4 , which was gradually improved to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "visibility representations lead to clear pictures and have gained a lot of interest , see also @xcite and the references given there . for planar graphs",
    "there are three ( main ) versions of visibility : weak , @xmath6 , and strong .",
    "they differ in the representation of the segments . in the weak version",
    "the vertex - segments may or may not include their extremes , such that an edge - segment may pass the open end of a third unrelated one .",
    "two vertices must see each other if they are adjacent , but not conversely .",
    "hence , weak visibility preserves the _",
    "subgraph property _ , which says that every subgraph of a weak visibility graph is a weak visibility graph .",
    "in the @xmath6-version , the edge - segments are bands with thickness @xmath7 and there is an edge if and only if the corresponding vertices see each other .",
    "finally , in the strong version there is an edge if and only if there is a visibility .",
    "the latter makes an essential difference , since the @xmath8 has no strong visibility representation .",
    "moreover , it is @xmath9-hard to determine whether a 3-connected planar graph has a strong visibility representation @xcite , whereas weak visibility is equivalent to planarity and thus testable in linear time .",
    "weak and @xmath6-visibility coincide on 2-connected planar graphs , and every 4-connected planar graph has a strong visibility representation @xcite .",
    "there are several attempts to generalize the planar graphs to nearly planar graphs , e.g. , via forbidden minors @xcite , surfaces of higher genus , or various restrictions on crossings , such as @xmath10-planar @xcite , almost planar @xcite or right angle crossing ( rac ) graphs @xcite . here",
    ", we consider 1-planar graphs , which are defined by drawings in the plane such that each edge is crossed at most once .",
    "1-planar graphs were introduced by ringel @xcite and occur when a planar graph and its dual are drawn simultaneously @xcite . as an example consider the complete graph @xmath11 , which can be drawn 1-planar with two nested triangles and straight - line edges",
    ".    the straight - line or rectilinear drawability of 1-planar graphs was first investigated by eggleton @xcite .",
    "he settled this problem for outer 1-planar graphs and proved that every outer 1-planar graph has a straight - line drawing . in outer 1-planar graphs",
    "all vertices are in the outer face and each edge is crossed at most once .",
    "thomassen @xcite generalized this result and proved that an embedded 1-planar graph has a straight - line drawing if and only if it excludes b- and w - configurations , see figs",
    ". [ fig : b - configuration ] and [ fig : w - configuration ] . then only x - configurations remain for pairs of crossing edges , see fig . [",
    "fig : x - configuration ] .",
    "the forbidden configurations were rediscovered by hong et al .",
    "@xcite , who also showed that there is a linear time algorithm to convert a 1-planar embedding without these forbidden configurations into a straight - line drawing .",
    "in fact , 1-planar graphs can be drawn as nice as planar graphs .",
    "alam et al .",
    "@xcite proved that every 3-connected 1-planar graph has an embedding with at most one w - configuration in the outer face , and has a straight - line grid drawing in quadratic area with the exception of a single edge in the outer face .",
    "such drawings can be computed in linear time from a given 1-planar embedding as a witness for 1-planarity . here",
    "we add visibility representations .",
    "there is a close relationship between 1-planar graphs and right angle crossing ( rac ) graphs , where edges must be straight - line and cross at a right angle @xcite .",
    "1-planar graphs and rac graphs have almost the same density , i.e. , the maximal number of edges for graphs of size @xmath1 , namely @xmath2 and @xmath12 . eades and liotta @xcite proved that every maximally dense rac graph is 1-planar .",
    "conversely , every outer 1-planar graph has a rac drawing with the same embedding @xcite .",
    "hence , the rac graphs range between the outer 1-planar and the 1-planar graphs . in fact , outer 1-planar graphs are planar @xcite .",
    "+ visibility representations have variously been generalized to two dimensions with vertices as non - overlapping paraxial rectangles and edges represented by horizontal and vertical visibility . in the rectangle visibility approach @xcite horizontal and vertical edge - segments may cross and the resulting graphs have up to @xmath13 edges .",
    "horizontal and vertical lines for edges were allowed in biedl s flat visibility representation @xcite , however , the lines do not cross and the horizontal lines are a shortcut for a local adjacency .",
    "hence , the concept is equivalent to weak visibility of planar graphs .",
    "the term 1- and 2-visibility was used by fmeier et al .",
    "@xcite for orthogonal drawings of planar graphs .",
    "dean et al .",
    "@xcite introduced @xmath10-bar visibility , where the vertices are represented as horizontal bars and bars are allowed to see through at most @xmath10 other bars . thus @xmath14-bar visibility is the common planar visibility , and in @xmath15-visibility a bar can be crossed by the visibility lines of many other bars .",
    "they discussed the weak , @xmath6 and strong versions and showed that @xmath15-bar visible graphs have at most @xmath13 edges .",
    "in fact , the formula for the density indicates that @xmath10-bar visible graphs are related to @xmath10-quasi - planar graphs @xcite , where no @xmath16 edges cross mutually .",
    "recently , sultana et al .",
    "@xcite showed that some special classes of graphs including the maximal outer 1-planar graphs are @xmath15-bar visible .    in this paper we generalize visibility representations such that they capture 1-planarity .",
    "the vertices are drawn as horizontal vertex - segments and an edge needs a vertical visibility and is represented by an edge - segment .",
    "uncrossed segments are transparent and become impermeable if they are crossed by a segment of the other type .",
    "hence , all crossings are right angle crossings ( rac ) between a vertex and an edge , and each object is involved in at most one crossing .    we show that every 1-planar graph has a 1-visibility representation in @xmath0 area , which can be computed in linear time from a given 1-planar embedding as a witness for 1-planarity .",
    "this settles a conjecture of sultana et al . @xcite .",
    "the algorithm uses the standard technique for visibility representations of planar graphs from @xcite via the st - numbering of the graph and its dual , which operates on the planar skeleton without crossing edges .",
    "the given embedding is augmented and transformed such that the 3-connected components have a normalized embedding @xcite and are separated by a copy of the edge between the separation pair .",
    "a local transformation suffices to re - insert a pair of crossing edges into the face left by their extraction .",
    "the 3-connected components are sandwiched between the horizontal vertex - segments of their separation pair , which comes directly from the st - numberings .",
    "1-visible graphs have the same maximal density as 1-planar graphs with at most @xmath2 edges for graphs of size @xmath1 .",
    "this is readily seen , since a 1-visible graphs consists of a planar subgraph together with one crossing edge per vertex .",
    "since the two outermost vertices are excluded the density reaches at most @xmath2 .",
    "so we provide a new and simple proof of the maximal density of 1-planar graphs .",
    "the so - called extended wheel graphs @xmath17 @xcite are examples of 1-planar graphs with maximal density .",
    "the @xmath18 graph is shown in fig .",
    "[ xq8 ] , where the visibility representation is obtained by our algorithm .    however , there are 1-visibility graphs with @xmath2 edges which are not 1-planar , including the complete graph on @xmath19 vertices without one edge , @xmath20-@xmath21 , which is not 1-planar @xcite .",
    "hence , the 1-visible graphs properly include the 1-planar graphs , even for maximally dense graphs .",
    "the vertex - edge crossings are a novel concept , which needs further investigations , e.g. , on the complexity of recognizing 1-visible graphs , on unique 1-visible representations , on @xmath6 and strong 1-visibility and extensions to @xmath10-visibility .",
    "consider simple undirected graphs @xmath22 with @xmath1 vertices and @xmath23 edges . we suppose that the graphs are 2-connected , otherwise , the components are treated separately , and are placed next to each other as in @xcite .",
    "note that articulation points may cause problems in visibility representations and make the difference between weak and @xmath6-visibility .",
    "this difference vanishes if the articulation points are in one face @xcite .",
    "articulation points do not matter in the weak version of visibility .",
    "a _ drawing _ of a graph is a mapping of @xmath24 into the plane such that the vertices are mapped to distinct points and each edge is a jordan arc between its endpoints .",
    "a drawing is _ planar _ if the jordan arcs of the edges do not cross and it is _ 1-planar _ if each edge is crossed at most once . in 1-planar drawings crossings of edges with the same endpoint are excluded .",
    "an embedding @xmath25 of a planar graph @xmath24 specifies _",
    "faces_. a face is a topologically connected region and is given by a cyclic sequence of edges and vertices that forms its boundary .",
    "one of the faces is unbounded and is called the _",
    "outer face_.    accordingly , a _",
    "1-planar embedding _",
    "@xmath25 specifies the faces in a 1-planar drawing of a graph @xmath24 including the outer face . a 1-planar embedding is a witness for 1-planarity . in particular",
    ", it describes the pairs of crossing edges and the face where the edges cross . here a face is given by a cyclic list of edges and half - edges and their vertices and crossing points .",
    "half - edge _ is a segment of an edge from a vertex to a crossing point .",
    "each crossing point in a 1-planar embedding is incident to four half - edges .",
    "if the crossing points are taken as new vertices and the half - edges as edges , then we have the _ planarization _ of @xmath25 , which is an embedded planar graph .",
    "this structure is used by algorithms operating on @xmath25 , where crossing points always remain as vertices of degree four and may need a special treatment .",
    "two 1-planar ( planar ) embeddings @xmath26 and @xmath27 of a graph are _ equivalent _ if there is a homeomorphism @xmath28 on the plane with @xmath29 .",
    "then one embedding can be transformed into the other while preserving all faces including the outer face .",
    "such transformations are _ embedding preserving_.    a _ visibility representation _ of a planar graph displays the vertices as horizontal bars , called vertex - segments , and two bars must see each other along a vertical edge - segment if there is an edge between the respective vertices .",
    "this is the _ weak _ version of visibility , where vertex - segments can see each other but their vertices are not necessarily connected by an edge .    in the @xmath6-visibility",
    "the edges are represented by vertical edge - segments of thickness @xmath7 and there is such a edge - segment if and only if there is an edge .",
    "the strong version imposes an if and only if condition between edges and visibility . for 2-connected graphs",
    "there is no essential difference between weak and @xmath6-visibility @xcite , since every weak visibility representation can be transformed into an embedding preserving @xmath6-visibility representation with at most twice the width of the drawing .    in this paper , we generalize visibility representations such that they fit to 1-planar graphs .",
    "we use weak visibility , since we wish to preserve the subgraph property : every subgraph of a 1-visible graph is 1-visible .",
    "the vertex - segments include their extremes and start and end at grid points .",
    "the @xmath6 and strong versions of 1-visibility do not seem useful , since many planar graphs can not be represented that way , such as circles of length at least four .",
    "the if and only if condition between edges and 1-visibility enforces at least one chord between non - adjacent vertices .    a 1-visibility representation of a graph @xmath30 displays each vertex @xmath31 as a horizontal vertex - segment @xmath32 and each edge @xmath33 as a vertical edge - segment @xmath34 from some point on @xmath35 to some point on @xmath32 .",
    "the endpoints of all segments are grid points .",
    "vertex segments ( edge segments ) do not overlap ( in their interior ) .",
    "each vertex - segment is crossed by at most one edge - segment and each edge - segment may cross at most one vertex - segment .",
    "notice that 1-visibility drawings are straight - line drawings on grids and there are right angle crossings between edges and vertices .",
    "hence , we have a new type of rac drawings @xcite .",
    "a 1-planar embedding is _ planar maximal _ if no further edge can be added without inducing a crossing or multiple edges .",
    "a 1-planar embedding can be augmented to a planar maximal embedding via its planarization , where crossing points remain as vertices of degree four .",
    "the augmentation can be computed in linear time from the embedding .",
    "note that the maximality depends on the embedding and a different embedding of a graph may give rise to another maximal planar augmentation , as the transformation of a b - configuration in fig .",
