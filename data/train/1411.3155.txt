    "we note that in the first overtone cepheids yet another group of non - radial modes was detected , periods of which are close to the first overtone period @xcite .    motivated by the _ kepler _ and _ corot _ results for rrc stars , suggesting that excitation of the additional mode might be a common phenomenon , we conducted a search for additional periodicities in the ground - based photometry of rrc stars .",
    "the publicly available photometry of the oiii - cvs is the best source for this search , as it offers a long time coverage , high photometric accuracy and large number of rrc stars .",
    "in addition we decided to focus our search on the galactic bulge rrc stars only @xcite , which are much brighter than magellanic clouds stars .",
    "consequently , the noise level is lower and chances for detecting additional low - amplitude periodicities are largest .",
    "the data were downloaded from ogle - iii on - line catalog of variable stars .",
    "the catalog contains photometry , obtained with the difference image analysis ( dia ) , collected during 19972009 years .",
    "we selected photometry in the @xmath13-band for all rrc and rrd stars from the galactic bulge ( 5080 stars ) .",

    "our search resulted in discovery of @xmath14 new rrc stars and two rrd stars with additional mode excited , of which 83 stars are firm detection and the remaining stars are strong candidates .",
    "thus the number of these interesting stars is significantly increased allowing a more detailed study of the phenomenon .    in section  [ sec.methods ]",
    "we describe the semi - automatic procedures for searching the additional periodicities .",
    "results are presented in section  [ sec.results ] and discussed in detail in section  [ sec.discussion ] .",
    "our most important findings are summarised in section  [ sec.summary ] . in the appendix we provide a list and detailed notes on other interesting stars with additional periodicities we have found during this study .",
    "the oiii - cvs contains 4989 rrc stars in the galactic bulge .",
    "that is why we had to develop a good automatic method for searching for stars with interesting non - radial mode . in a nutshell",
    ", the adopted procedure combines fourier analysis of the original data , which allows to find period of the first overtone ( @xmath15 ) , prewhitening the data with the fourier series and fourier analysis of the residuals . at this stage analysis",
    "was performed over a frequency range from 0 to 10 @xmath16 .",
    "based on the petersen diagram for the already known first overtone pulsators with non - radial mode ( fig . 2 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we assume that the period of the additional mode , @xmath17 , should fall in a range @xmath18 . corresponding frequency range was searched . in order to decide whether a signal is significant",
    "we used arbitrarily chosen criterion of signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath19 .    besides the non - radial mode in question , there are many more possible signals in the data which hamper the automatic analysis .",
    "additional signals usually come from slow trend in the data , long - term modulation of pulsation amplitude and phase ( the blazhko effect ) , period change , instrumental effects or other radial modes .",
    "slow trend produces peaks in the low frequency domain of the spectrum .",
    "the blazhko effect typically manifests as equally spaced multiplets at the main frequency and its harmonics . period change or long - period blazhko effect lead to unresolved signal at @xmath20 and its harmonics .",
    "periods of other radial modes form characteristic period ratios with the first overtone period different than @xmath21 .",
    "quite often we detect additional peaks at close - to - integer frequency values , typically the highest peak at @xmath22 and its aliases .",
    "we interpret these signals as of instrumental origin .",
    "peaks associated with most of the discussed effects should not fall in the frequency range of interest , however their daily aliases  inherent to ground - based photometry  can . therefore , we need to consider every signal before searching for the additional mode .",
    "trends were modelled with additional sine function of long period ( @xmath23 days ) fitted to the data .",
    "the procedure works well for linear and slow parabolic trends but in many cases signal in low frequencies remained and produced aliases . during",
    "further analysis remaining signal , its daily aliases , and neighbouring @xmath24 frequency range were excluded from the automatic search .",
    "here @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the data length , is a formal resolution of the fourier transform . in the following analysis",
    "however , we adopted a conservative criterion and regard two frequencies as resolved if their separation @xmath27 .",
    "we can not model the instrumental signal ( @xmath28 ) so we only excluded it and its aliases from further analysis .    for many stars ,",
    "after prewhitening the data with primary frequency and its harmonics , we were able to find signal in the vicinity of @xmath20 . in the case of unresolved signal , which may correspond to period change or long - period blazhko effect , we excluded its daily aliases from analysis",
    ". resolved frequencies were assumed to originate from the blazhko effect with modulation period @xmath29 .",
    "we note that search for additional signal at @xmath20 was restricted to @xmath30 range which was dictated by the shortest blazhko period known ( above 5 days , * ? ? ?",
    "we prewhitened the data with multiplet components , @xmath31 , and the whole procedure was repeated from the beginning , i.e. new residual data were inspected for the presence of a signal at low frequencies and of instrumental effects , and finally again for a signal near the primary frequency .",
    "described method should not be considered as an analysis of the blazhko effect , but rather as a way to clear the spectrum from unwanted signals , without proper distinction for origin of the signal . for the adopted procedure",
    "there was no difference between the real blazhko modulation and alias of other signal accidentally placed close to the main frequency .",
    "for this reason we are not able to say precisely how many rrc stars show the blazhko effect .",
    "this issue will be considered in a forthcoming publication .",
    "when no significant peak in the proximity of @xmath32 was found , residuals were ready for search of the non - radial mode .",
    "described procedure was tested on the sample of more than 200 stars , manually analysed before .",
    "it found all real candidates from the test sample , although it sometimes misclassified stars without the non - radial mode as candidates . in these cases ,",
    "the false detection was caused e.g. by the non - stationary signals present in the data ( and their aliases ) or by signals of unknown origin ( see appendix ) .",
    "finally , the described method was applied to all rrc stars from the galactic bulge .",
    "all stars selected as candidates by automatic procedure were analysed manually .",
    "frequencies found during this approach were fitted to the original data in the form of @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the order of decomposition chosen so that @xmath35 for each @xmath36 .",
    "then we performed data clipping , so all deviating points were removed .",
    "the chosen criterion was @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the dispersion of the fit .",
    "last step of the candidate selection procedure was to check all stars for a possible contamination . in order to do this , for each candidate we found all variable stars from oiii - cvs within 1 arcsec radius around the candidate , and checked whether their periods coincide with the secondary periodicity of the candidate star or with its aliases .",
    "as a result , we excluded one star from our sample , ogle - blg - rrlyr-12902 , in which additional periodicity may be caused by nearby rrc star ogle - blg - rrlyr-12836 .",
    "we note that for other candidates we can not exclude the possibility of contamination entirely , because additional variable star may be too close to the candidate to be resolved or it is not included in the ogle catalog .",
    "strong period change is quite common among rrc stars ( see next section , and tabs .  [ table : pewne ] and [ table : kandydatki ] ) .",
    "consequently , in many stars we found unresolved signal at @xmath20 .",
    "this signal and its aliases not only complicate the automatic analysis as described above , but also significantly increase the noise level in the fourier transform and may hide the additional peak . in an attempt to remove this troublesome signal we applied a variant of a method",
    "called time - dependent prewhitening described by @xcite . for each star we divided the data into subsets . the division is naturally provided by observational seasons . for each subset",
    "we fitted the fourier series with fixed frequency , derived from the whole dataset , adjusting amplitudes and phases only .",
    "consequently , possible period changes were reflected in the seasonal variations of the fourier phase @xmath39 .",
    "residuals from all the subsets were joined and subjected to fourier analysis .",
    "the method works well if period change is slow , i.e. period may be regarded approximately constant within each season . in majority of the cases",
    "we could entirely remove the residual signal at @xmath20 .",
    "we note that the method also removes seasonal zero - point differences , possibly present in the data , and non - stationarities connected e.g. to amplitude changes . as a result",
    ", noise level in the fourier transform was decreased and we could detect additional non - radial mode in 17 stars . in fig .",
    "[ fig.tdfd ] we illustrate the effects of applying time - dependent prewhitening to star with strong period change . clearly , the noise level was significantly decreased and additional non - radial mode showed up .",
    "in addition , we manually analysed 91 rrd stars from the galactic bulge .",
    "we searched for the additional mode in the frequency spectrum prewhitened with frequency of the fundamental mode , first overtone and their detectable combinations .",

    "we have discovered 147 stars with additional periodicity in the frequency range on interest . in tab . [",
