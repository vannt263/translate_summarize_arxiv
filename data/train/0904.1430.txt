    "in recent years , multi - wavelength selection techniques have been successful in identifying different populations of star - forming galaxies at high redshifts , @xmath8 [ see @xcite for a recent review ] .",
    "an important class of such galaxies consists of the lyman-@xmath1 emitters ( hereafter laes ) , objects identified through their excess emission in narrow - band images centred on the redshifted lyman-@xmath1 wavelength ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "follow - up lyman-@xmath1 spectroscopy has yielded accurate redshifts for a significant fraction of the lae population ( e.g. @xcite ) , unlike most other high-@xmath11 star - forming galaxies ( e.g. lyman - break systems , sub - mm galaxies ) , which typically only have photometric redshifts .",
    "in fact , an lae at @xmath13 @xcite has the highest confirmed spectroscopic redshift of all presently - known galaxies .",
    "laes constitute a significant fraction of the star - forming galaxy population at @xmath14 , sufficient to reionize the universe at earlier epochs ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the number density of laes and the typical shape of the lyman-@xmath1 emission line therefore provide important probes of physical conditions in the universe around the epoch of reionization ( e.g. @xcite ) . equally important",
    ", the steep drop in the space density of quasars at @xmath8 implies that they would be unable to produce the ultraviolet ( uv ) background radiation required to reionize the universe ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "star - forming galaxies like the laes are thus most likely to have been responsible for reionization ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "understanding the factors that influence the star - formation activity in these systems ( e.g. the molecular gas content , the star formation efficiency , etc ) is hence of much importance .",
    "recent studies of individual laes at @xmath15 have shown that these galaxies have a wide range of properties , with best - fit stellar masses ranging from @xmath16 , ages from @xmath17  myr and metallicities from @xmath18 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "evidence has also been found for significant amounts of dust in laes , with uv extinctions of @xmath19  mag .",
    "( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that the observed decrease in the the cosmic star - formation rate at @xmath20 ( e.g. @xcite ) might be explained by the presence of dust in the @xmath20 lae population .",
    "typical star - formation rates ( sfrs ) in laes , as inferred from their uv continua , are low , a few tens of solar masses per year ( e.g. @xcite ) ; these are @xmath21 times larger than the sfrs derived from the resonantly - scattered lyman-@xmath1 line . while this difference could arise from dust obscuration effects , hi  absorption by the damping wing of the gunn - petersen trough is likely to also contribute towards reducing the strength of the lyman-@xmath1 line for laes at @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "we note that the tentative detection of the h@xmath1 line in a single @xmath2 lae @xcite yielded a significantly higher sfr estimate ( @xmath23  yr@xmath5 ) than that obtained even from the rest - frame uv continuum ( @xmath24  yr@xmath5 ) ; this emphasizes the possibility that the sfrs in other laes might have been under - estimated due to dust extinction .",
    "the detectability of high-@xmath11 galaxies like the laes relies on their undergoing an elevated level of star - formation activity , which naturally requires fuel in the form of molecular gas .",
    "such gas is most effectively studied through observations of redshifted co emission lines ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the luminosity in the  co lines can be used to estimate the total molecular gas mass fueling the star - formation activity , while the co line widths provide a measure of the dynamical mass of the galaxy .",
    "studies of molecular gas at high redshifts , @xmath25 , have so far focused on the most massive , far - infrared - luminous systems , the sub - mm galaxies or quasars ( e.g. @xcite ) , and no information is available in the literature on the molecular gas content of `` normal '' star - forming galaxies , such as the laes .    in the present work , we address this outstanding problem by conducting a sensitive search for low - excitation co line emission in two @xmath22 laes with the green bank telescope ( gbt ) , which allows us to place strong constraints on their total molecular gas masses . throughout this _ letter _ , we adopt a cosmological model with @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "our two target laes were selected to have @xmath22 , to ensure that their redshifted  lines could be observed with the sensitive gbt ku - band receiver . the first system , hcm  6a at @xmath2 @xcite , is perhaps the best candidate lae for a search for molecular emission as it is strongly lensed by a foreground cluster ( abell  370 , at @xmath27 ; @xcite ) , with a magnification factor of @xmath3 ; this significantly improves the sensitivity to co emission .",
    "it also has the highest estimated sfr of all known laes ; @xcite found excess broad - band emission in a _",
    "irac  4.5@xmath28 m image , compared to the continuum at other wavelengths , and argue that this is due to strong h@xmath1 emission , with an implied sfr of @xmath23  yr@xmath5 .",
    "the sfr inferred from the uv continuum ( uncorrected for dust effects ) is significantly lower than this , @xmath29  yr@xmath5 @xcite , similar to values obtained in other laes at @xmath30 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if the sfr derived from the _ spitzer _ image is correct , the discrepancy between the two sfr values implies a high dust extinction , @xmath31  mag , consistent with the value independently derived from a fit to the broad - band photometric data ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "such a high sfr would be similar to that of nearby ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , which have typical molecular gas masses of @xmath32 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "conversely , @xcite argue that the limits on the 850  @xmath28 m and 1.2  mm continuum flux densities of hcm  6a imply upper limits to the sfr in the range @xmath33  m@xmath34  yr@xmath5 , for assumed dust temperatures in the range @xmath35  k ; these sfr estimates are somewhat lower than the values obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that the properties of hcm  6a are similar to those of other @xmath8 laes ; the molecular gas properties derived for this object are thus likely to be representative of the entire population .",
    "our second target , iok-1 , was discovered in a subaru survey for @xmath36 laes @xcite and has the highest spectroscopically - confirmed redshift of all known galaxies .",
    "@xcite obtain a star - formation rate of @xmath37  yr@xmath5 from the lyman-@xmath1 line luminosity .",
    "@xcite find that the sfr estimated from the uv continua of @xmath30 laes is typically @xmath38 times larger than that inferred from the lyman-@xmath1 line , implying that the sfr of iok-1 is likely to be @xmath39  yr@xmath5 , among the highest of the @xmath20 lae population .",
    "this system has not so far been observed at sub - mm or infrared wavelengths and no information is thus available on its dust properties .",
    "the search for  emission ( @xmath40  ghz ) from the two laes was carried out with the gbt @xmath41  ghz ku - band receiver between august and september 2008 , during excellent summer observing conditions .",
    "the auto - correlation spectrometer was used as the backend , with two circular polarizations and a bandwidth of 200  mhz , sub - divided into 8192 channels and centred on the redshifted  line frequencies ( 14.48  ghz and 15.25  ghz ) .",
    "this yielded a total velocity coverage of @xmath42  km  s@xmath5  and an initial velocity resolution of @xmath43  km  s@xmath5 , after hanning - smoothing and re - sampling .",
    "dual - beam nodding was used to calibrate the system bandpass , with a nodding timescale of 2  minutes .",
    "the telescope pointing was corrected every @xmath44  hours by observations of nearby bright calibrators .",
    "system temperatures were measured online by firing a noise diode , and were typically found to lie in the range @xmath45  k. the standard flux calibrators , 3c48 , 3c147 and/or 3c286 were used to verify the absolute flux scales at the observing frequencies ; we estimate that the uncertainty in the flux calibration is less than 10% .",
    "the total observing times were @xmath46  hours for hcm  6a and @xmath47  hours for iok-1 , including overheads associated with dual - beam nodding , pointing and flux calibration .",
    "note that the full - width - at - half - maximum of the gbt ku - band beam is @xmath48 ( corresponding to a spatial scale of @xmath49  kpc at @xmath50 ) , implying that all  emission from the laes ( and any nearby galaxies at similar redshifts ) would lie within the telescope beam .",
    "the data were analyzed using the gbtidl data analysis package , following standard procedures .",
    "a second - order baseline was fit to each scan during the initial calibration , after which the data were examined on a scan - by - scan basis for residual baseline structure ; this was done independently for both polarizations .",
    "conservatively , all scans showing baseline structure on scales of a few tens of mhz ( that might mimic a putative spectral line ) were edited out and not included in the final analysis ; this resulted in the excision of @xmath46% of data for each target .",
    "the final on - source integration times were @xmath51  hours for hcm  6a and @xmath52  hours for iok-1 . for each source , data from the two polarizations",
    "were combined together with appropriate weights , based on their root - mean - square ( rms ) noise values to produce the final spectra .",
    "the spectra were then smoothed to coarser resolutions ( 50 , 150 and 300  km  s@xmath5 ) to search for  line emission .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     0.1 in @xmath53the quoted values of rms noise , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are at a velocity resolution of @xmath56  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "+ @xmath57for hcm  6a , the luminosity and mass limits have been corrected for a magnification factor of 4.5 .",
    "the final spectra obtained towards hcm  6a and iok-1 are shown in the four panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] , at velocity resolutions of @xmath58  km  s@xmath5  and @xmath59  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the final rms noise values per @xmath60  km  s@xmath5  channel are 52  @xmath28jy ( hcm  6a ) and @xmath61  @xmath28jy ( iok-1 ) , and per @xmath62  km  s@xmath5  channel are @xmath63jy ( hcm  6a ) and @xmath64jy ( iok-1 ) .",
    "no evidence for  line emission was seen in the spectra at these ( or other ) velocity resolutions .",
    "the non - detections of  line emission place strong constraints on the co line luminosities , which can , in turn , be used to derive limits on the total mass of cold molecular gas in the two laes . following @xcite ,",
    "the  line luminosity @xmath54 can be written as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the observing frequency ( in ghz ) , @xmath67 is the luminosity distance ( in mpc ) , and @xmath54 is in k  km  s@xmath5  pc@xmath68 . for our non - detections , @xmath69 ( in jy  km  s@xmath5 )",
    "gives the @xmath70 upper limit on the integrated flux density in the  line , where @xmath71 is the rms noise at the velocity resolution @xmath72 .",
    "we will assume a line width of @xmath73  km  s@xmath5 , similar to the median observed width in high-@xmath11 quasars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we then obtain @xmath70  line luminosity limits of @xmath74  k  km  s@xmath5  pc@xmath6 ( hcm  6a ) and @xmath75  k  km  s@xmath5  pc@xmath6 ( iok-1 ) , after correcting the hcm  6a luminosity for the lensing magnification factor of 4.5 @xcite .    to convert the  line luminosity to an estimate of the total molecular gas mass requires the co - to - h@xmath12 conversion factor @xmath76 ( e.g. @xcite ) . for virialized molecular clouds in a quiescent galaxy like the milky way , the conversion factor is typically @xmath77  ( k  km  s@xmath5  pc@xmath6)@xmath5 ( e.g. @xcite ) ; conversely , luminous infrared galaxies have far lower co - to - h@xmath12 conversion factors [ @xmath78  ( k  km  s@xmath5  pc@xmath6)@xmath5 ; e.g. @xcite ] .",
    "for the nearby dwarf starburst galaxy , m82 , @xcite find that the lowest values of the conversion factor are measured towards the central star - forming regions where the uv radiation field is most intense .",
    "given that the two laes observed here appear to be undergoing elevated levels of star - formation , we adopt the conversion factor @xmath79  ( k  km  s@xmath5  pc@xmath6)@xmath5 .",
    "note that this conversion factor is also used for co line studies of high-@xmath11 sub - mm galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) , allowing a direct comparison between the inferred molecular masses of sub - mm galaxies and laes . using this conversion factor",
    "then yields @xmath80 for hcm  6a , and @xmath81 for iok-1 .",
    "we emphasize that the upper limits to the molecular gas mass would be higher than the above values if the milky way conversion factor were applicable to these laes .",
    "the results of our observations are summarized in table  [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "finally , the  line luminosity and the fir luminosity are correlated in nearby starburst and spiral galaxies @xcite , with @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "our limits on the  line luminosity can be combined with this relation to infer the fir luminosity of the two laes and thence , their sfrs .",
    "we obtain @xmath83 ( hcm  6a ) and @xmath84 ( iok-1 ) , and sfrs of @xmath85  yr@xmath5 ( hcm  6a ) and @xmath86  yr@xmath5 ( iok-1 ) , on using the relation sfr  @xmath87  yr@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the limit to the sfr in hcm  6a is similar to that obtained from the 1.2  mm and 850  @xmath28 m continuum imaging ( sfr  @xmath88  yr@xmath5 ; @xcite ) .",
    "while our sfr limit in hcm  6a is significantly lower than the estimate of @xmath23  yr@xmath5 from the tentative detection of h@xmath1 emission @xcite , it should be pointed out that our result depends on the assumption that the local correlation between  line luminosity and fir luminosity is applicable in @xmath20 laes .",
    "note , however , that some classes of high - redshift galaxies [ e.g. the `` b@xmath11k '' galaxies , selected as outliers in plots of @xmath89 versus @xmath90 colors ; @xcite ] have larger co line luminosities than predicted by the fir - co relation , with large molecular gas masses but low star formation efficiencies @xcite .",
    "if the high - redshift laes are similar to the b@xmath11k galaxies , our limits to the  line luminosities would imply even lower fir luminosities , and star - formation rates , than those listed above .",
    "these are the first constraints on the  line luminosity and the molecular gas mass of @xmath8 laes , providing a new window into physical conditions in star - forming galaxies at the highest redshifts . the high inferred sfr and dust extinction in hcm  6a , as well as its large magnification factor ,",
    "imply that it is one of the best candidates for a detection of co emission in a high-@xmath11 lae .",
    "the limit on its  line luminosity obtained here is the deepest ever obtained for a @xmath8 galaxy . for the assumed co - to - h@xmath12 conversion factor ,",
    "the molecular gas mass limit is within a factor of @xmath91 of the molecular gas mass of the milky way ( e.g. @xcite ) . while the limit on the  line luminosity of iok-1 is not as strong , it is lower than the median luminosity in high-@xmath11 sub - mm galaxies ( @xmath92  k  km  s@xmath5  pc@xmath6 ; @xcite ) and similar to the luminosities of lower - redshift b@xmath11k galaxies ( which have similar sfrs ; e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our results for both laes rule out the presence of extreme  line luminosities , such as those seen in sub - mm galaxies or hyperluminous ir quasars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "laes thus appear to either contain significantly lower quantities of cold molecular gas or have significantly higher co - to - h@xmath12 conversion factors than sub - mm galaxies or fir - bright quasar hosts .",
    "the latter possibility can not be ruled out as the co - to - h@xmath12 conversion factor is likely to depend on metallicity ( e.g. @xcite ) , and quasar host galaxies and sub - mm galaxies appear to be dusty , metal - rich systems .    finally , it is clear that molecular gas must be present in laes to fuel the observed star - formation activity and dust reddening . in cases where the co line emission is optically thick and thermalized ,",
    "the flux density in the co lines scales @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the rotational quantum number of the upper level .",
    "this suggests that , despite the sensitive limits obtained here , the @xmath95 co lines may provide a more effective avenue to probe the molecular gas content of high-@xmath11 laes , with planned facilities like the expanded very large array ( evla ) and the atacama large millimetre array ( alma ) .",
    "for example , for optically - thick , thermalized emission , alma would be able to detect the  line from a @xmath96 star - forming galaxy with @xmath97 in @xmath98  hours of on - source integration time .",
    "unfortunately , the high kinetic temperatures and densities required to raise the co molecules to the high-@xmath99 excitation states are unlikely to be present in `` normal '' star - forming galaxies like the laes .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "9 of @xcite shows that the co line intensities are sub - thermal at @xmath95 in almost all galaxies ( including ulirgs and sub - mm galaxies ) with observations of these lines .",
    "the sole exception is the lensed quasar apm08279 + 5255 , where a combination of agn heating and very high gas densities appears to yield the high co excitation @xcite .",
    "this implies that it is likely to be difficult to detect the high-@xmath99 co lines from @xmath8 laes even with alma .",
    "the @xmath100 m fine - structure transition of ionized carbon may hence prove the best candidate for mapping the large - scale structure of high-@xmath11 star - forming galaxies and determining their dynamical masses @xcite .",
    "a search for this transition in hcm  6a is currently in progress [ kanekar et al .",
    "( _ in prep .",
    "we have carried out a deep gbt ku - band search for  line emission from two high - redshift lyman-@xmath1 emitters , hcm  6a at @xmath2 and iok-1 at @xmath101 .",
    "our non - detection of co emission from the lensed lae , hcm  6a , implies strong constraints on its  line luminosity and molecular gas mass , @xmath102  k  km  s@xmath5  pc@xmath6 and @xmath103 , the strongest obtained to date for a @xmath8 galaxy . in the case of iok-1",
    ", the absence of a lensing magnification factor implies that the limits on the line luminosity and molecular gas mass are somewhat less sensitive than for hcm  6a ; we obtain @xmath104  k  km  s@xmath5  pc@xmath6 and @xmath105 .",
    "if hcm  6a is a typical lae at these redshifts , our results imply that laes are unlikely to show high  line luminosities ( such as those found in quasar host galaxies at similar redshifts ) , due to either a lower molecular gas content or a higher value of the co - to - h@xmath12 conversion factor .",
    "it hence appears that observations of redshifted co line emission are unlikely to be an effective means of studying gas dynamics in the less - luminous galaxies responsible for reionizing the universe , even with upcoming arrays such as alma and the evla .",
