    "in the large scale region of income , profits , assets , sales and etc ( @xmath0 ) , the cumulative probability distribution function ( pdf ) @xmath1 obeys a power - law for @xmath0 which is larger than a certain threshold @xmath2 : @xmath3 this power - law and the exponent @xmath4 are called pareto s law and pareto index , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the power - law distribution is well investigated by using various models in econophysics  @xcite .    recently , fujiwara et al .",
    "@xcite find that pareto s law can be derived kinematically from the law of detailed balance and gibrat s law  @xcite which are also observed in the large scale region @xmath5 . in the proof ,",
    "they assume no model and only use these two laws in empirical data .",
    "the detailed balance is time - reversal symmetry ( @xmath6 ) : @xmath7 here @xmath8 and @xmath9 are two successive incomes , profits , assets , sales , etc . and @xmath10 is the joint pdf .",
    "gibrat s law states that the conditional pdf of growth rate @xmath11 is independent of the initial value @xmath8 : @xmath12 here growth rate @xmath13 is defined as the ratio @xmath14 and @xmath11 is defined by using the pdf @xmath15 and the joint pdf @xmath16 as @xmath17 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the kinematics is extended to dynamics by analyzing data on the assessed value of land in japan . in the non - equilibrium system",
    "we propose an extension of the detailed balance ( detailed quasi - balance ) as follows @xmath18 from gibrat s law ( [ gibrat ] ) and the detailed quasi - balance ( [ detailed quasi - balance ] ) , we derive pareto s law with annually varying pareto index . the parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 are related to the change of pareto index and the relation is confirmed in the empirical data nicely .",
    "these findings are important for the progress of econophysics . above derivations are , however , valid only in the large scale region where gibrat s law ( [ gibrat ] ) holds .",
    "it is well known that pareto s law is not observed below the threshold @xmath2  @xcite .",

    "this is confirmed in the empirical data .    in this study , we prove that the @xmath8 dependence of @xmath22 ( [ t ] ) with @xmath27 is unique if the pdf of growth rate is approximated by tent - shaped exponential functions ( [ tent - shaped1 ] ) , ( [ tent - shaped2 ] ) .",
    "this means , consequently , that the pdf in the large and middle scale region ( [ handm ] ) is also unique if the @xmath8 dependence of @xmath28 is negligible .",
    "we confirm these approximations in profits data of japanese companies 2003 and 2004 @xcite and show that the pdf ( [ handm ] ) fits with empirical data nicely by the refined data analysis .",
