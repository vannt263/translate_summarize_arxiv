    "in perturbative qcd , calculations of physical quantities such as scattering amplitudes or cross sections beyond the born approximation basically requires one to account for running @xmath2 effects . in fixed - order calculations",
    ", @xmath2 becomes running in a straightforward way , by direct calculation of feynman graphs .",
    "however , in various approaches , scattering amplitudes or cross sections are often calculated to all orders of the perturbation theory .",
    "generally this means that some equations are constructed and solved and when such equations include the running of @xmath2 , the argument of @xmath2 is usually fixed by certain prescriptions which are based on different approximations .",
    "for example , for hard qcd processes exploiting dglap evolution @xcite , one takes    @xmath3    in every rung of quark / gluon ladder , with @xmath4 being the transverse momentum of the ladder parton . as a consequence , in the evolution equations",
    "@xmath5    with @xmath6 being the upper limit for integration over transverse momenta @xmath4 of ladder partons . in particular , when the dglap is used for calculation of the structure functions of the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , @xmath7 is the virtuality of the photon .",
    "the dependence of @xmath2 given by eqs  ( [ k],[q ] ) follows from the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for the treatment of @xmath2 in hard qcd processes . on the other hand ,",
    "some important high energy qcd processes are regge - like , rather than hard .",
    "in particular , high energy forward and backward scattering and dis at small @xmath0 are typical regge - like processes .",
    "the use of the hard -like prescription @xcite of the qcd coupling for these regge processes should have been justified somehow . indeed ,",
    "much recent work uses the argument of @xmath2 given by eqs .",
    "( [ k ] , [ q ] ) without any comments .",
    "for example , in ref @xcite eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) is used for incorporating running @xmath2 into the bfkl equation though it is well - known that the bfkl is constructed especially for the regge kinematics .",

    "@xcite for hard processes and often used subsequently for description of different high energy qcd processes is an approximation valid only for hard qcd processes .",

    "@xcite is valid for the evolution of dis structure functions at small @xmath0 and for other high energy qcd processes in the regge kinematics .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in sect  2 we discuss the treatment of @xmath2 in elementary parton processes . in sect .",
    "3 we extend it to partonic ladders in the regge kinematics and compare our results with results those of ref .",
    "finally , sect .  4 contains our concluding remarks .",

    "the feynman graphs corresponding to @xmath31 are depicted in fig .  1 .",

    "( [ alpha ] ) the contribution proportional to the number of colours , @xmath34 comes from graphs with gluon loops whereas the contribution proportional to @xmath35 comes from the qed -like graphs where the gluon propagator is saturated only by quark loops .",

    "( [ alpha ] ) , the argument of @xmath2 in eq .",

    "as is well - known , the slavnov - taylor  @xcite identities state that accounting for radiative corrections to @xmath39 lead to the same dependency , @xmath40 . therefore both for the quark and gluon scattering , adding radiative corrections to the part of the born scattering amplitude with an @xmath1 -channel gluon",
    "transforms it into    @xmath41    where we have dropped the color factors .",

    "( [ mr ] ) than leads to    @xmath47    where we have used @xmath48 .",
    "we remind the reader that throughout this paper we assume all partons to be slightly off - shell . for the on - shell quarks , the second term in the rhs of eq .",

    "does not fix the phase of @xmath53 . in order to fix @xmath54",
    ", one can use the fact that @xmath46 does not have an imaginary part when @xmath1 is negative .",
    "then , the analytical continuation of @xmath46 from positive @xmath1 to negative @xmath1 is defined through the upper path , because the cut in the @xmath1 -plane when @xmath55 . in doing so",
    ", @xmath1 acquires the factor @xmath56 leading to @xmath57 .",

    "now let us allow all partons in eqs .",
    "( [ quarks]),([gluons ] ) and ( [ quarksgluons ] ) to be off - shell so that their virtualities can not be neglected .",
    "it is obvious that letting the on - shell partons which were considered in sect .  2",

    "our formulae eqs .",
    "( [ imu]),([imuqg ] ) also remain valid for off - shell parton scattering , save a change of @xmath42 .",

    "1 - 4 ) as the scale of @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast to this , the scale of @xmath2 for the quark - gluon and gluon - quark rungs is the space - like virtuality of the vertical gluon lines . +",

    "( [ quarklad ] ) .",
    "however , some interesting objects ( e.g. for the singlet dis structure function @xmath9 ) are made of mixing of the quark and gluon rungs as shown in fig .",
    "5 , so that the integrand corresponding to fig .",
    "5 is proportional to @xmath76 instead of the dglap succession ]    @xmath77    a further difference concerning treatment of @xmath2 arises when those ladders are used for calculation of cross sections ( e.g. dis structure functions ) , which contain the imaginary part , @xmath78 of these ladders : as all @xmath1 -channel gluons ( the horizontal lines in fig .",
    "5 ) are time - like , the related @xmath2 have non - zero @xmath79 too .",
    "accounting for them makes the pattern much more complicated than the standard dglap approach .",
    "ladder graphs incorporating all orders in @xmath2 are essential ingredient of the dis structure functions .",

    "let us suppose that some dis structure function @xmath80 obeys a bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "the part of this equation involving the @xmath1 -channel cut of the ladder virtual gluon is represented by the graph in fig .",
    "for example , it corresponds to the dglap equation or ( after replacing the photon lines in fig .",
    "6 by gluon ones ) - to the first term of the bfkl equation with running @xmath2 .",
    "after simplification of the spin structure , its contribution , @xmath81 can be written as follows :    @xmath82    where we have used the standard notations : @xmath13 stands for the virtual photon momentum , @xmath83 and @xmath4 is transverse to the plane formed by @xmath13 and @xmath84 .",
    "the intermediate partons with momenta @xmath12 in fig .",
    "6 can be either quarks or gluons .",
    "the external parton with momentum @xmath84 is assumed to be on - shell and we will neglect its virtuality , which is not important for our conclusions .",
    "as we are discussing the treatment of @xmath2 , we have dropped unessential numerical factors from rhs of eq .",
