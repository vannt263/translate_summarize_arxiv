    "slave clocks method is proposed to overcome the limit of conventional ieee 1588 clock synchronization approaches causing clock synchronization errors in asymmetric links by way of using only one - way exchange of timing messages @xcite , where the authors claim that multiple unknown parameters in clock synchronization  i.e. , clock offset , clock skew , and master - to - slave delay  can be estimated simultaneously using more equations than usual resulting from the use of dual slave clocks . the claim ,",
    "however , is contrary to the well - known fact that the clock offset and the delay can not be differentiated with only one - way message dissemination @xcite .    to investigate the issues in the formulation of multi - parameter estimation in @xcite , we first model the master clock and the dual slave clocks generated by a common signal in terms of an _ ideal , global reference time _ @xmath1 . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider continuous clock models and ignore clock jitters in modeling ; in this case , the master clock and the dual slave clocks at @xmath1 are given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the frequencies of the master clock and the common clock driving the dual slave clocks , and @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are the phase differences of the master clock and the dual slave clocks ( i.e. , clock 1 and clock 2 shown in fig.@xmath03 of @xcite ) with respect to the ideal reference clock , respectively .",
    "given these models , we can describe the two slave clocks in terms of the master clock ( i.e. , @xmath8 ) as follows : @xmath9 where @xmath10 note that at the slave , @xmath11 ( i.e. , normalized clock skew ) and @xmath5 are unknown because these are parameters related with the master clock , while @xmath6 and @xmath7  though their true values are also unknown  are controllable and their ratio ( i.e. , @xmath12 ) can be set to the frequency ratio between the slave clocks due to the dual clock generation described in @xcite ( i.e. , 2 when both clocks begin at the same time ; see fig.@xmath0[fg : phase_ratio ] for illustration ) .",
    "now consider the equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) of @xcite describing a relationship between the times of slave clocks when the @xmath13-th sync message is received : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the master - to - slave delay , @xmath16 is a common offset of the slave clocks , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are random jitters of slave clock 1 and 2 within a period , respectively .",
    "we can see that , except for the noise components ( i.e. , @xmath17 and @xmath18 representing clock jitters ) , ( [ eq : master_slave_clock1 ] ) and ( [ eq : master_slave_clock2 ] ) are generalized expressions ( i.e. , at any time instant ) for time relationship between the master and the slave clocks .",
    "chin and chen argue that , because a single signal drives both the clocks as shown in fig . 3 of @xcite , they have the same offset ( i.e. , @xmath16 ) with respect to the master clock .",
    "this , however , is not the case in general ; from ( [ eq : slave_clock1_phase ] ) and ( [ eq : slave_clock2_phase ] ) , we obtain the condition for the slave clocks to have a common offset with respect to the master clock ( i.e. , @xmath19 ) as follows : @xmath20 as we discussed with ( [ eq : clock_skew])([eq : slave_clock2_phase ] ) , the number of parameters of the left - hand side of ( [ eq : phase_condition ] ) can be reduced to one ( e.g. , @xmath7 when @xmath21 ) , but at the the right - hand side , both @xmath11 and @xmath5 are unknown at the slave and parameters to be estimated . in other words , for the equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) of @xcite to be valid , not only the value of @xmath7 ( or @xmath6 ) but also the values of @xmath11 and @xmath5 should be known at the slave , which verifies that chin and chen s formulation of multi - parameter estimation is invalid .",
    "note that in case of @xmath22 ( i.e. , both the slave clocks begin ( or reset ) at the same time ) , the times of slave clocks should meet the following condition ( again , ignoring random noise components for simplicity ) ) . ] : @xmath23 in such a case the equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) of @xcite should be rewritten as @xmath24 unlike the original equations of @xcite , ( [ eq : new_slave_clock1 ] ) and ( [ eq : new_slave_clock2 ] ) can not be manipulated to separate the delay ( @xmath15 ) from the clock offset ( @xmath16 ) or vice versa , which invalidates the resulting maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimates in @xcite .",
    "note that , in practical applications like clock synchronization in wireless sensor networks ( wsns ) , the best one can do with these equations is the estimation of the clock skew and the clock offset assuming that @xmath15 is negligible and that @xmath25 as suggested in @xcite ."
