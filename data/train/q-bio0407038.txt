    "when a cardiac cell is depolarized by an electrical stimulus , it exhibits a prolonged elevation of transmembrane potential known as an action potential .",
    "we define the action potential duration ( apd ) as the time required for the cell to achieve 80% repolarization following a depolarizing stimulus . the refractory period between the end of an action potential the application of a subsequent stimulus",
    "is called the diastolic interval ( di ) .",
    "it is known that apd restitution ( the dependence of the apd on preceding di ) is of fundamental importance in paced cardiac dynamics . in particular , studies @xcite show that the slope of the apd restitution curve ( rc ) is linked to the onset of alternans , an abnormal cardiac rhythm characterized by long - short variation of apd , which may lead to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death @xcite .",
    "experimental @xcite and analytical @xcite investigations have shown that different pacing protocols lead to different apd rcs , a phenomenon known as apd rate - dependence .",
    "several studies @xcite indicate that the origin of apd rate - dependence is the presence of memory in cardiac tissue .",
    "that is , apd depends not only upon the preceding di but also on the previous history of paced cardiac tissue .",
    "memory appears to be a generic feature of cardiac muscle since it has been reported in humans @xcite and various animals @xcite .",
    "testing for rate - dependence involves the use of multiple pacing protocols and comparison of the resulting rcs .",
    "two of the most commonly used pacing schemes are the dynamic and s1-s2 pacing protocols . under the dynamic ( steady - state )",
    "protocol , pacing is performed at a constant basic cycle length @xmath0 until steady - state is reached ( no beat - to - beat variation in apd or di ) .",
    "after recording the steady - state di - apd pair , @xmath0 is changed by an amount @xmath1 and the process is repeated .",
    "the dynamic rc is constructed by plotting all steady - state di - apd pairs obtained from the dynamic pacing protocol over a range of @xmath0 values .",
    "the s1-s2 ( standard ) protocol also begins with pacing at a fixed basic cycle length @xmath0 ( s1 interval ) until steady - state is reached .",
    "then , an s2 stimulus is applied at an interval @xmath2 after the final s1 stimulus . setting @xmath3 ,",
    "the s1-s2 rc is obtained by plotting the apd following the s2 stimulus versus the preceding di for different values of @xmath4 .",
    "note that there is only one dynamic rc , whereas each different s1 pacing interval can yield a distinct s1-s2 rc . for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "we obtain only _ local _",
    "s1-s2 rcs ( @xmath5 small relative to s1 ) for different values of the s1 interval .",
    "in particular , following @xcite we apply one short @xmath6 and one long @xmath7 perturbation at each different value of @xmath0 .",
    "the connection between rate - dependent apd restitution and memory is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ compare - apd ] , which shows apd rcs obtained from numerical simulations using two different ionic models ( see section ii ) of the cell membrane .",
    "figure [ compare - apd]a is generated using a two - current model @xcite with no memory : the dynamic and s1-s2 rcs are indistinguishable .",

    "indeed , when a sequence of propagating pulses is produced , both apd and the propagation speed of a pulse are influenced by the preceding pulse .",
    "conduction - velocity restitution is analogous to apd restitution in that it relates the speed of an action potential at a given site to the di at that site .",
    "several authors @xcite have noted that abrupt changes in the pacing rate lead to discrepancies between the wavefront and waveback velocities .",
    "for this reason , we will always distinguish between wavefront ( or activation front ) velocity and waveback ( or recovery front ) velocity of propagating action potentials .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate rate - dependence of wavefront and waveback velocities of propagating action potentials in a one - dimensional fiber of cardiac cells . using numerical simulations of different ionic membrane models ( with and without memory )",
    "we demonstrate that the waveback velocity exhibits pronounced rate - dependence and the wavefront velocity does not ( section ii ) .",
    "we derive an analytical relationship between wavefront and waveback velocities by modeling cardiac dynamics using a system of coupled maps with an arbitrary amount of memory .",
    "we show that apd restitution , not memory , leads to waveback velocity rate - dependence ( section iii ) .",
    "we provide conclusions and discussion in section iv .",
    "an appendix on the two - current ionic model is included for reference .",
    "typically , the cardiac action potential is modeled by considering ionic currents that flow across the cell membrane via ion channels .",
    "the rate - of - change of the transmembrane voltage is obtained by summing all ionic currents and dividing by the membrane capacitance .",
    "the ion channels act as gates that regulate the permeabilities of ions , most notably sodium , potassium and calcium .",
    "hence , ionic models are presented as systems of ordinary differential equations that govern transmembrane voltage and gate variables .    in the case of a one - dimensional fiber , electrical coupling",
    "can be modeled by the inclusion of a diffusion term .",
    "the result is a reaction - diffusion partial differential equation known as the cable equation : @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes transmembrane voltage , @xmath11 measures distance from the stimulus site , @xmath12 is membrane capacitance , @xmath13 is a diffusion coefficient , and @xmath14 is the sum of all ionic currents .",
    "the number of currents varies depending upon the complexity of the ionic model .",
    "the diffusion coefficient incorporates membrane capacitance , cell surface - to - volume ratio , and longitudinal resistivity of cardiac muscle tissue . in all of our numerical simulations",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "neumann boundary conditions @xmath17 are imposed at both ends of the cable .    to investigate rate - dependent propagation",
    ", we perform numerical simulations of eq . .",
    "we apply both dynamic and s1-s2 pacing protocols at one end of a cable , and measure the wavefront and waveback velocities of each propagating pulse . by analogy with apd rate - dependence",
    ", velocity rate - dependence means that different pacing protocols lead to different velocity rcs .",
    "since memory is responsible for apd rate - dependence , it is natural to hypothesize that memory also leads to wavefront and waveback velocity rate - dependence .",
    "consequently , we use two different ionic models in our numerical simulations : a two - current ionic model @xcite with no memory and a three - current ionic model @xcite with some memory .",
    "the details of the numerical experiments are as follows . using a cable of length @xmath18 , we solve eq . numerically with an operator - splitting method .",
    "stimuli are applied over a 1 mm region at the proximal ( @xmath19 ) end of the fiber using both the dynamic and s1-s2 protocols described in the introduction . in all simulations",
    ", we use @xmath20 ms and @xmath8 ms .",
    "pacing results in a train of pulses that propagate left - to - right in the fiber .",
    "measurements of di , apd , wavefront speed , and waveback speed are taken at @xmath21 .",
    "the position of a pulse wavefront is defined as the @xmath11 value for which the transmembrane voltage is @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "likewise , waveback position is defined as the @xmath11 value at which @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "linear interpolation is used to improve tracking of wavefront and waveback positions .",
