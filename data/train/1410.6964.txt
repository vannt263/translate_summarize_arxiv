    "one of the most important aspects of pre  main sequence ( pms ) stellar evolution is the interaction of the star with its surrounding environment .",
    "the rate at which the central object accretes and ejects material , stellar and circumstellar magnetic fields , and the geometry of the circumstellar environment all play an important role in the system s evolution and the ultimate formation of planets . while many important details of a star s interaction with its environment have been clarified for the low  mass pms classical t  tauri stars ( cttss ) ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , much of the picture is still uncertain for the intermediate ",
    "mass pms herbig ae / be stars ( hereafter haebes ) .",
    "haebes are intermediate mass ( 210 ) stars first classified by george herbig in 1960 according to their a or b  type emission line spectra and their association with , and illumination of , nebulosity @xcite .",
    "these criteria have since been adjusted by various authors in order to incorporate potential haebes that may have been excluded based on herbig s original criteria ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a decade after herbig s catalog was established , @xcite confirmed the pre ",
    "main sequence nature of haebes by showing that their surface gravities are lower than main sequence stars of the same spectral types .",
    "these observational results placed the haebes in the hr diagram above the zero  age main sequence of theoretical evolutionary tracks ( e.g. those of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , further suggesting the young age of these objects .",
    "the youth of haebes has since been confirmed by multiple studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the analogy with cttss motivated herbig s search for the higher mass haebes . in general , haebes and cttss have a number of observed features in common , most notably infrared excesses indicating circumstellar material @xcite and , in the case of ctts and some haebes , excess uv / optical luminosity attributed to mass accretion onto the star ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "strong emission lines , both permitted and forbidden , are also common to both groups @xcite .",
    "we note that there are currently no specific criteria differentiating between distinct pms evolutionary phases for haebes as there is for the ttss ( cttss vs weak line ttss , or wttss ) , although the idea of haebes representing an evolutionary sequence has been outlined in several studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus we consider haebes as a single group even though observed features can vary widely from star to star and a continuum of evolutionary stages is most likely present within any large haebe sample . although haebes share many observed properties with cttss , it is still unclear as to the extent to which haebes interact with their circumstellar environments in ways similar to cttss .",
    "the presence of circumstellar disks around many haebes is now well established ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is also significant evidence that many haebes are actively accreting material from their disks @xcite .",
    "the strong balmer lines and excess uv / optical continuum emission in cttss are generally accepted to be produced by accreting disk material that falls to the surface along magnetic field lines from a truncation point in the disk at several stellar radii above the star @xcite .",
    "this scenario , termed magnetospheric accretion ( ma ) , can account for many of the observed properties and spectral features in cttss @xcite .",
    "in addition , strong magnetic fields , which are required in order for ma to occur , are ubiquitous on ttss ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "magnetospheric accretion has also been used to explain accretion signatures in some haebes @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated accretion rates for a large sample of haebes by assuming that ma operates in these systems .",
    "it is unclear , however , that ma is the dominant accretion mechanism in haebes .",
    "perhaps the largest uncertainty regarding ma in haebes is the current lack of detected magnetic fields on these objects . @xcite",
    "analyzed 50 haebes using low ",
    "resolution spectropolarimetry and found only 812% of their sample to have detectable magnetic fields .",
    "they also place an upper limit of 300 g on the longitudinal fields of the undetected sample .",
    "more recently , @xcite performed a high  resolution spectropolarimetric study of 70 haebes .",
    "the high resolution of their data provided greater sensitivity to zeeman signatures , enabling detection of weak longitudinal fields .",
    "their results include the confirmation of 5 magnetic haebes while only _",
    "one _ new object ( hd 35929 ) is reported as magnetic .",
    "although the magnetic field strengths predicted for ma to operate around haebes are closer to @xmath0a few hundred gauss @xcite , as opposed to the kilogauss fields required for low mass stars , the lack of significant detections of _ any _ magnetic fields on a large majority of these objects , many of which shows signs of active accretion , suggests a different accretion mechanism is mediating the transfer of mass from the disk to the star .",
    "since outflows around young stars are known to be correlated with accretion @xcite , a shift from ma to a different accretion mechanism may impact the type and strength of outflowing material as well .",
    "the focus of this study is to probe the inner accretion and wind launching regions using the  line diagnostic , which has been successfully employed for similar studies of cttss ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as in mass loss studies of wolf  rayet stars @xcite and classical be stars @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present high spectral resolution observations of the line for a sample of 56 haebes .",
    "the diagnostic is an excellent tracer of outflowing material due to its metastable lower level , i.e. unless the electron density is sufficiently high for collisional de  excitation to be important , the atoms tend to remain in the lower 2s@xmath1 energy level until a photon is absorbed ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details on the atomic data ) .",
    "thus , he atoms excited into the lower energy level have the ability to trace the full velocity extent of the material .",
    "section 2 provides a brief overview of haebe magnetic fields and how these fields potentially mediate accretion and outflows . in  3 we discuss our observations and data reduction procedures .",
    "the line profiles and their morphology classifications are given in  3 .",
    "the incidence of red and blue  shifted absorption features in our sample is also presented in  3 .",
    "the line profiles are examined and analyzed in  5 within the context of disk or stellar winds and mass infall . in  5 we also elaborate on the implications of our observations for haebes as a whole , as well as discuss scenarios potentially responsible for the differences in morphology statistics observed between haebes and cttss .",
    "a summary of our findings and conclusions are presented in  6 .",
    "as mentioned in  1 , magnetic fields have only been confirmed on a handful of haebes @xcite while kilogauss strength magnetic fields seem to be ubiquitous on cttss @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the required surface dipolar field strength for magnetospheric accretion to occur on a typical haebe , according to the ma theories of @xcite and @xcite , is a few hundred gauss , much lower than the kilogauss fields required for cttss .",
    "although a large majority of haebes do not have confirmed magnetic fields , most of the attempted measurements have been performed using polarimetry .",
    "the uncertainties of these measurements are large , often tens to hundreds of gauss @xcite . for polarimetric measurements of magnetic fields on cttss",
    "the detected longitudinal fields are of the order @xmath0100 g ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while zeeman broadening measurements reveal strong average fields of @xmath02 kg @xcite .",
    "for the objects in our sample with measured @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5sin@xmath6 we have calculated the predicted mean surface equatorial magnetic field strength using the theory of @xcite .",
    "the median field strength for our sample is 470 g , about a factor of 4 lower than for cttss .",
    "thus the longitudinal fields measured via polarimetry may simply be too low to detect under current observational constraints .",
    "zeeman broadening measurements for haebes would provide better constraints on the surface magnetic field strengths .",
    "however , the high @xmath5sin@xmath6 values of haebes and fewer number of photospheric absorption lines compared to ctts makes zeeman broadening detections very difficult . in any case , we can not rule out ma on haebes based on the lack of detected fields ; the field strengths , although large enough to produce ma flows , may simply be too weak to detect using current methods and instrumentation .",
    "@xcite pointed out that if ma is operating on some haebes then the large @xmath5sin@xmath6 values for many stars would force the corotation radii to be very small ( @xmath02 @xmath3 ) , outside of which accretion can not take place @xcite .",
    "small corotation radii , or truncation radii , result in smaller magnetospheres around haebes compared to cttss .",
    "we note that `` smaller '' in this case refers to the volume of the ma flow where the flow kinematics are dominated by the magnetic field .",
    "thus smaller magnetospheres are , in general , required in order for ma to operate around haebes .",
    "we test this prediction observationally in  5.1.2 .",
    "since smaller corotation radii , and in turn smaller magnetospheres , are expected for haebes experiencing ma , the question arises : can magnetocentrifugal winds be driven by small magnetospheres ?",
    "numerical simulations have shown that ctts magnetospheres can drive strong outflows from the magnetosphere ",
    "disk interaction region ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and this behavior is expected from analytic ma theories @xcite . for a wind being driven along a magnetic field line",
    ", the field enforces corotation out to approximately the alfvn radius , @xmath7 .",
    "thus inside @xmath7 the velocity of the outflowing gas is @xmath8(@xmath9)=@xmath5sin@xmath6(@xmath10 ) if we take @xmath5sin@xmath6 to be the approximate rotation velocity of the field line anchored to star .",
    "if we assume that the escape velocity at @xmath7 is approximately the velocity of the gas at @xmath7 , we can estimate @xmath7/@xmath3=[@xmath11/(@xmath5sin@xmath12@xmath3)]@xmath13 .",
    "we note that here @xmath7/@xmath3 differs from the corotation radius in the disk , @xmath14/@xmath3 , by a factor of 2@xmath13 .",
    "the large @xmath5sin@xmath6 values of haebes , and thus the small corotation radii , will generally result in smaller values of @xmath7 in haebes than in cttss .",
    "we will also investigate the difference in @xmath7 between haebes and cttss in  4.4 .",
    "our sample of haebes ( ) consists of 56 objects chosen from the catalogues of @xcite ; @xcite ; and @xcite .",
    "classification as a haebe was the only criteria for being included in our sample .",
    "as a result , our sample covers a wide range of spectral types , from b0 to f2 .",
    "our objects most likely cover a wide range in evolutionary status .",
    "the evolutionary implications of our observations will be discussed in  4 . while this broad selection criteria makes it difficult to make specific comparisons between groups with distinct observational properties , it is sufficient for reaching general conclusions about haebes as a whole .",
    "physical parameters for our sample are given in .",
    "with the exception of the radial velocity for some objects , the values are taken from the literature sources indicated in column 10 .",

    "this setup yields a velocity resolution of @xmath06 km s@xmath19 at either telescope .",
    "spectroscopic standards were obtained for the entire range of haebe spectral types ; telluric standards were obtained at a variety of airmasses .",
    "tharne lamp exposures were taken in order to provide wavelength calibrations . signal  to  noise ratios varied significantly for the phoenix sample depending on the combination of object brightness and the telescope used for the observation .",
    "almost all 2.1 m targets required 4x900s observations in order to achieve a s / n@xmath2215 , although the faintest objects have s / n@xmath1610 . repeating long exposure sequences for individual objects in order to boost the final s / n was avoided in order to obtain decent s / n exposures of more of the targets in our sample .",
    "this strategy was necessary to obtain quality observations of a large number of haebes . in any case",
    ", a low s / n spectrum is usually adequate for our purposes of identifying a feature and measuring a reliable equivalent width .",
    "marginal cases are noted as such in the discussion .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ]    we note that the presence of sub  arcsecond companions , which appear to be common around haebes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , has a minimal effect on the analysis presented here .",
    "first , the large flux ratios of the haebe primaries to ctts companions at 10830  ensures that absorption profiles are dominated by absorption of flux from the primary .",
    "companion ctts absorption profiles would be heavily veiled and , with the possible exception of the weak absorption features seen in a few spectra , would not be in agreement with the absorption strengths observed by @xcite that rarely penetrate below 50% of the stellar continuum .",
    "a similar argument can be made concerning the strengths of the emission components .",
    "thus any profile contributions from ctts companions will likely be small perturbations on top of the primary haebe profile .",
    "in addition , the orbital separation of the binary would , in general , have to be very small in order to enable the absorption of flux from the primary by material emitted by the ctts companion .",
    "small physical separations of haebe binaries seem to be rare @xcite so these objects are unlikely to affect our analysis in this way .",
    "all of the data were reduced using custom idl routines .",
    "each pair of images was differenced and flat  fielded .",
    "the differenced spectra were then optimally extracted and co  added after being interpolated onto the same wavelength scale .",
    "any remaining bad pixels were manually averaged between adjacent pixels . for objects observed at high airmass , a telluric standard was scaled and divided into the object spectrum in order to remove the atmospheric features , most importantly the oh absorption lines at @xmath010832 and 10834  .",
    "these lines are present in each of the spectra shown in and are generally weak , even at high airmass .",
    "any residual telluric absorption not removed by the telluric standard was masked using a quadratic estimate of the stellar spectrum across the narrow width of the oh telluric line .",
    "third  order polynomial wavelength solutions were obtained by fitting the observed tharne lamp exposures using line identifications from @xcite .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ]    in order to evaluate the contamination of photospheric absorption features , we employed both observed spectroscopic standards and synthetic spectra generated using synthmag @xcite .",
    "a sample of our observed standards are shown in .",
    "many of our observed standards , which cover spectral types from b2 to f7 , do not show any photospheric features .",
    "an overwhelming majority of our science targets also do not show any obvious photospheric lines .",
    "this is not unexpected : according to line lists extracted from vald @xcite , there are few strong spectral lines ( 0.90 of the continuum ) in our observed wavelength range in a  type stars , the exception being si i at @xmath1810827 and 10843 and a s i line at @xmath1810821 in the a67 objects .",
    "photospheric he i lines only become prominent in @xmath0b5 stars and earlier .",
    "most of our b ",
    "type objects are rotating so fast that the photospheric he i lines are broadened to the point of becoming negligible contributors to the spectrum . as a check , we visually examined the photospheric contribution of a broadened synthetic spectrum of similar @xmath23 to each object .",
    "out of the sample , only hd 34700 , mwc 953 , and hd 200775 were significantly altered by the subtraction of the synthetic spectrum .",
    "the result of this subtraction is shown in .",
    "it can be seen that the profile morphology is not altered , i.e. the profile classification of these objects does not change .",
    "the low number of impacted objects is mainly a result of the moderate  to  high _ _ v__sin_i _ values of our targets which tend to make the photospheric contributions weak compared to the circumstellar features . for the reasons stated above , the large majority of our sample does not require any removal of photospheric features and we are confident that the spectra presented in represent true contributions from the circumstellar environment . first ",
    "order normalization was performed using an average of the detector response along the columns on the detector where the spectra are located .",
    "this response function was measured using a median flat field from each night .",
    "any residual slope was divided out using a linear fit .",

    "the measurements contained in are profile classification ( column 3 ) , the maximum blue and red  shifted line velocities ( cols . 4 and 5 ) , the velocity of peak emission and absorption ( cols . 6 and 7 ) , the line fluxes relative to the continuum at the peak emission and absorption velocities ( cols . 8 and 9 ) , and the blue and red equivalent widths ( cols . 10 and 11 ) . in general , our 56 objects can be categorized into six different morphology groups : 1 .",

    "the polar stellar wind is meant to emulate the ma scenario in which accreting material is predominantly deposited at high latitudes , i.e. an accretion powered stellar wind @xcite .",
    "the deposition of energy mainly at high latitudes is believed to drive a stellar wind more strongly from these locations . in a spherically expanding stellar wind , there is no preferred location on the stellar surface from which the wind is driven .",
    "it is unclear how ma can produce a wind of this nature .",
    "thus the polar wind provides an approximation for what a stellar wind might look like if driven by high  latitude ma flows .",
    "their models include the scattering of stellar continuum photons and , in some cases , an in situ emission component .",
    "the stellar wind models also follow multiple scatterings of photons back into the line of sight .",
    "they explore a range of disk truncation radii ( resulting in disk shadowing of the retreating flow , in some cases ) , disk inclination angles , and high and low turbulent gas velocities ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) , all of which can have a significant impact on the resulting profile morphologies . disk ",

    "in general , our observed profiles match better the stellar wind profiles of , and those are the ones we discuss further .",
    "show that the emission peaks near zero velocity can be reproduced if the receding flow is blocked by the disk , i.e. the disk either extends to the surface of the star or the truncation radius is well inside the radius of origin of the outflow ( figures 4 and 5 of ) .",

    "it is not possible to be more specific concerning the inclination angle and truncation radius of the system based on our observed profiles using only the qualitative similarities of different models from .",
    "however , since the disk shadowing scenario is plausible and since it is difficult to produce our pcii profiles without some degree of disk shadowing , it is reasonable to conclude that this geometry applies to the pcii objects .",
    "we note that the polar stellar wind models , which is the likely case for accretion powered stellar winds where material is impacting the stellar surface along magnetic field lines at high latitudes , tend to produce stronger emission than absorption for non  polar viewing angles .",
    "the polar wind profiles do not match our pcii profiles as well as the spherical wind model profiles .",
    "the pci profiles tend to be matched better by models in which disk shadowing is unimportant , i.e. the disk truncation radius , @xmath45 , is @xmath025 @xmath3 allowing the red  shifted emission peak to become visible .",
    "however , this type of profile is also produced if the inclination angle is small for a disk  shadowed system , allowing the red  shifted emission to be viewed through the small space between the star and truncated disk .",

    "the profiles of ab aur , hd 163296 , hd 38120 , and hd 250550 all have comparable emission and absorption components implying that some form of in situ emission is necessary to balance the profile contributions .",

    "it appears that a variety of scenarios are potentially responsible for the formation of the pci profiles .",
    "however , due to the evidence for smaller magnetospheres , and thus smaller disk truncation radii , presented in the next section we believe it is less likely that the pci profiles are produced in systems with large @xmath45 .",
    "the profile of v380 ori is unique among our pc objects : the emission is centered at zero  velocity and strongly dominates the blue  shifted absorption .",

    "v380 ori is a confirmed magnetic haebe @xcite and appears to be strongly accreting @xcite .",
    "in addition , it shows clear signs of significant circumstellar material @xcite .",
    "thus it is possible that the polar wind signature is the result of a stellar wind driven by magnetically controlled accretion onto the star at high latitudes .",
    "however , if the viewing angle is @xmath060@xmath39 and the accretion stream is impacting the star at @xmath1660@xmath39 from the pole , then red  shifted absorption should appear in the profile .",
    "this scenario will be explored more fully using optical accretion diagnostics ( cauley & johns  krull 2014 , in prep ) .      in cttss",
    "ipc signatures are produced by ma ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as was previously mentioned in  2 , the lack of magnetic fields detected around haebes casts doubt , but does not rule out the possibility , that the ma scenario holds for most of these objects .",
    "this is especially true for the hbe stars which show a much lower incidence of red  shifted absorption at than cttss ( and ) .",
    "none of the objects displaying ipc profiles in our sample have detected magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "@xcite , hereafter fkeh , modeled the red absorption at in cttss by assuming that stellar and accretion  generated continuum photons are scattered by a funnel flow falling along a dipolar magnetic field geometry from an annulus in an accretion disk .",
    "their models show that for all but the smallest inclination angles , i.e. a viewing angle nearly pole  on , red  shifted absorption is prominent for almost the entire range of funnel flow parameters . observe red  shifted sub  continuum absorption in at least one observation in 19 of 39 cttss , 49% of their sample , all of which are known to be accreting . even excluding the objects that have variable profiles and do not show red absorption in all observations , 18 of 39 , or 46% , of their objects show red  shifted absorption .",
    "thus the detected 36% of hae stars and 15% of hbe stars with ipc profiles in our study ( ) suggests that ma is less common among the hbe stars than it is among cttss and occurs at a similar rate in the hae stars compared to cttss .",
    "this is confirmed by contingency tests performed on the different groups ( ) .",
    "if haebes experiencing ma have smaller magnetospheres , the maximum infall velocities reached by the accreting gas should be smaller fractions of the stellar escape velocity than is found for cttss .",
    "measured the approximate maximum red  shifted absorption velocity for the ctts profiles from .",
    "we have reproduced from with the inclusion of the red  shifted absorption haebes from this study . shows the measured maximum red  shifted absorption velocity plotted against the stellar escape velocity for the ipc and red  shifted absorption haebes in our sample ( blue circles ) and the cttss from ( red diamonds ) .",
    "it is clear that cttss on average show maximum red  shifted absorption velocities that are a greater fraction of their stellar surface escape velocities .",
    "this suggests that accretion flows in haebes begin deeper in the system s gravitational potential , i.e. closer to the star , as can be readily understood by noting the relationship between @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the distance at which the infalling material originates , given in equation 2 of .",
    "this is what one would expect if the magnetospheres , and thus the disk truncation radii , are smaller in haebes than in cttss .    in order to test the significance of the differences between the haebes and cttss in , we have performed two  sample ks tests on ten thousand random samplings of the observed distributions of the ratio of red  shifted absorption velocity to stellar escape velocity . in order to specify a range of allowed values for each sampling",

    "magnetospheric accretion appears to be uncommon in mid to early b  type stars but seems to be present at a similar rate to cttss in hae and late hbe stars .",
    "useful information concerning the accretion geometries of the stars in our sample can be gained from narrowing our analysis to only the stars with determined accretion rates .",
    "if haebes occupy a broad range of evolutionary states , it is certainly possible that many negligibly accreting objects are present in our sample which would lower the occurrence rate of ipc profiles at he i @xmath1810830 , although we have attempted to remove these objects from the sample ( see  3.1 ) . and show that red  shifted absorption signatures at are absent for cttss with 1@xmath21 m veilings @xmath220.5 , with veiling defined as the ratio of the excess emission to the underlying stellar photosphere ( see * ? ? ?",
    "higher veiling at 1 @xmath21 m has been shown to scale with other accretion indicators in cttss , indicating that objects with higher accretion rates will show higher veilings @xcite",
    ". suggests this may be the result of different accretion geometries becoming important in cttss with higher accretion rates , i.e. ma may be inhibited by magnetospheres being crushed down to the stellar surface due to high disk accretion rates .",
    "smaller magnetospheres in haebes could mimic this result since weaker red  shifted absorption tends to be produced by these geometries compared to larger magnetospheres .",
    "these weak signatures may be masked by emission in an outflow and further reducing the incidence of red - shifted absorption .    to test this hypothesis in our haebe sample , in we have plotted the mass accretion rate ( column 7 from ) versus the blue ew minus the red ew .",
    "the ew difference is essentially a measure of profile type since negative values imply ipc profiles and positive values imply p ",

    "[ fig : fig7 ]        if red  shifted absorption at in cttss with large accretion rates tends to be suppressed due to a crushed magnetosphere , then the relative lack of red  shifted absorption in haebes with large accretion rates suggests that a similar scenario is operating around these objects .",
    "the weaker magnetic field strengths on haebes compared to cttss supports the idea that large accretion rates are able to force the magnetosphere down to smaller radii , with the extreme cases ( e.g. very weak magnetic fields or very large accretion rates ) potentially resulting in boundary layer accretion .",
    "if the magnetospheres around haebes are _ intrinsically _ smaller and the field strengths are weaker , then increases in the accretion rate may more easily crush the magnetosphere closer to the stellar surface , resulting in the lower incidence of red  shifted absorption in haebes with large accretion rates . also shows a relative lack of blue  shifted absorption at low accretion rates .",
    "if haebe magnetospheres are crushed by large mass accretion rates , this would indicate that the outflows around haebes are predominantly driven by boundary layer  type accretion since the blue  shifted absorption profiles are predominantly produced by objects with large @xmath2 .",
    "however , as pointed out by for the cttss , the lack of red  shifted absorption could also be due to the filling in of red  shifted absorption by wind emission and not the altering of the accretion geometry .",
    "the lack of _ simultaneous _ red and blue  shifted absorption in our sample , however , suggests it is the latter since simultaneous accretion and outflows would likely result in observable simultaneous blue and red  shifted absorption in at least some objects .    if many accreting haebes have smaller magnetospheres or are accreting through a boundary layer , then the truncation radius will be smaller or nonexistent .",
    "the lack of a truncated disk has implications for planet migration down to small orbital radii .",
    "it was first suggested by @xcite that planetary migration may eventually be halted by a resonance interaction with the truncated inner  disk .",
    "if this mechanism contributes to halting inward planet migration , and sufficiently truncated disks are not present in many haebe systems , then the frequency of gas giant planets in close orbits ( @xmath9@xmath160.10 au ) should be much lower than for solar  mass objects .",
    "we note that simulated density functions by @xcite recently found evidence that this migration  halting scenario does not match the orbital distribution of jupiter  mass planets as well as a tidal circularization model does .",
    "however , this analysis was performed for objects with masses @xmath161.5 @xmath38 due to the small statistics for planets around f , a , and b  type stars .",
    "a larger sample of orbital radii for giant planets around f , a , and b stars will provide a better basis for comparing how the lack of inner disks during early stellar evolution can affect planet migration .",
    "when comparing the profiles of our haebes to the ctts profiles in , a feature that differs significantly between the two samples is that _ the haebe sample shows no evidence of narrow , blue  shifted absorption at any velocity_. we exclude the possible case of mwc 137 due to its unknown system rv .",
    "according to the models of the key profile signature of a disk wind is narrow blue  shifted absorption resulting from the scattering of stellar photons along streamlines extending outward at some angle from the disk .",
    "the small range in absorbed velocities is due to the fact that the line of sight to the stellar surface only intersects a small range of velocities in the disk wind , compared to the entire range of velocities , including the acceleration zone , for wind streamlines that originate on the star .",
    "as the inclination of the system becomes more edge  on , the absorption tends to become stronger .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus it is expected that some type of disk wind signature would be present in a non  zero fraction of accreting haebe profiles if ma involving large magnetospheres were the dominant accretion mechanism . on the other hand , if haebes tend to have smaller magnetospheres than cttss , a disk ",
    "wind launched from a range of radii near the truncation point closer to the stellar surface would become indistinguishable from a stellar wind for most viewing angles .",
    "this is especially true for x  wind configurations where the wind launching region is confined to a very narrow annulus near the corotation radius @xcite .",
    "thus we can not rule out the presence of disk winds in our sample based on the lack of narrow blue  shifted absorption profiles .",
    "we note that the lack of direct inner disk wind evidence in our sample does not conflict with the recent interpretations of interferometric observations of br@xmath48 in a small number of haebes as arising in a disk wind @xcite .",
    "the disk winds diagnosed in these cases ( specifically dx cha , hd 163296 , and v921 sco * ? ? ?",
    "* ) likely arise over much larger radii ( i.e. near the dust sublimation radius at a few tenths of an au ) than are traced by he i @xmath1810830",
    ".      there is an important difference between the ipc profiles in our haebe sample and the cttss from : blue  shifted absorption , indicating a disk or stellar wind , is present in 16 of 21 cttss that also show red  shifted absorption .",
    "the 13 stars with red  shifted absorption or ipc profiles in our sample _ do not show any evidence of blue  shifted wind signatures_. there is a strong correlation between accretion and outflow rates in ttss ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) which points to mass accretion being the main driver of outflows in these objects .",
    "the presence of outflow signatures in ctts ipc profiles also supports this conclusion .",
    "the relationship between mass accretion and mass outflow extends into the haebe mass range ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "since this relationship seems to apply to haebes , we would expect to see some sort of outflow signature at in a fraction of the ipc objects . since this is not observed , and since literature h@xmath15 profiles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) of the ipc objects do not show any direct evidence of blue  shifted wind signatures , it is currently unclear whether or not mass accretion is capable of driving strong outflows on these objects . as noted in  5.2.1 the ipc objects generally have average or below  average accretion rates .",
    "based on the @xmath49 vs @xmath50 relationship from @xcite , accretion rates of this magnitude should be able to drive detectable outflows .",
    "similar average accretion rates ( @xmath010@xmath51 @xmath38 yr@xmath19 ) are seen in some of the pc objects confirming that these accretion rates are capable of driving outflows .",
    "this suggests that the ipc objects , which show evidence of ma , are less efficient at driving outflows compared to the pc objects which may be accreting through a different mechanism ( see  5.2.4 ) .",
    "the presence of red  shifted absorption at requires the existence of infalling material near the star .",
    "the lack of outflow signatures in our ipc objects suggests that these stars do not have strong accretion  powered outflows .",
    "it is unlikely that this is due to differing formation conditions for the wind versus the accretion flow since signatures tracing outflowing gas is expected to form at similar distances from the star as the accreting material .",
    "in addition , the relative lack of strong outflows in haebes as a whole is supported by optical forbidden line statistics which show a much lower fraction of occurrence of large scale outflows in haebes than in ctts ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if haebe magnetospheres are smaller than those of cttss , it may be more difficult to produce the magnetic configurations at the disk ",
    "magnetosphere interaction region necessary to drive strong outflows .",
    "furthermore , mass infall from deeper in the star s gravitational potential will result in less of the necessary energy to accelerate an outflow from the stellar surface .",
    "thus accretion driven _ stellar _ winds in haebes experiencing ma may be less efficient .",
    "to our knowledge , no simulations of the magnetospheric star ",
    "disk interaction region have been performed using typical haebe parameters .",

    "cygni objects in our sample show evidence of mass infall in he i @xmath1810830",
    ". showed that weak red  shifted absorption is produced at most inclinations angles for stars with low veilings and truncation radii of @xmath02 @xmath3 .",
    "these weak absorption signatures could be overwhelmed by strong emission in a wind @xcite .",
    "red  shifted absorption from a ma flow would also be absent for inclination angles near @xmath00@xmath42 .",
    "thus it is possible to see evidence of an accretion  launched outflow without seeing any direct signature of mass infall . however , the significant lack of red  shifted absorption seen in hbe profiles compared to hae stars and cttss suggests mass infall is truly absent rather than being the result of viewing angle effects or filling in by wind emission .",
    "an alternative to ma is to drive the outflows from an equatorial boundary layer created by the accretion disk at the stellar surface .",
    "this will be discussed below in  5.4 .",
    "we note that only one object in our sample has an estimated luminosity high enough ( mwc 1080 ; @xmath52@xmath03.8 x 10@xmath53 @xmath54 ) to potentially produce a radiatively driven wind of any significance @xcite .",
    "thus the strong outflows observed in our sample are most likely accretion related .",
    "there is growing consensus that herbig ae ( hae ) stars interact with their environments differently than herbig be ( hbe ) stars .",
    "in particular , hbe objects are found to show weaker evidence for ma , including line widths inconsistent with gas rotating at keplerian velocities near or inside of the disk truncation radius @xcite , a lower incidence of line polarization effects due to scattering of stellar photons by disk  like circumstellar material @xcite , differences in excitation conditions of h@xmath55 @xcite , and a possible breakdown of the br @xmath48accretion luminosity relationship that holds for cttss and hae stars @xcite , although we note that the accretion luminosities determined by @xcite are calculated with a relationship derived using an a2v photosphere which may under ",
    "predict @xmath56 for stars with spectral types earlier than a2 .",

    "we note that our data do not display this trend : we find no relationship between the total ew and effective temperature .",
    "the observed differences between hbe and hae objects may indicate that , in general , the two groups are being observed at different phases of their pre  main sequence evolution .",
    "more specific evolutionary classifications , as proposed , for example , by @xcite , would facilitate comparisons between objects that are at more similar stages of development . a second , although related , possible source of the observed differences is the misclassification of _ classical _ be objects as hbe stars ( see  4.1 ) .",
    "it is unlikely that the pc and ipc hbe stars in our sample are misclassified since their h@xmath15 features , in general , do not match the typical zero  velocity centered double  peaked emission of the classical be objects @xcite .",
    "assuming that all of the objects in our sample not discussed in  4.1 are actually haebes , the hbe stars show different rates of occurrence of particular line profile morphologies compared to the hae stars ( ) , although the contingency tests result in relatively high @xmath24values ( ) indicating that the red and blue  shifted absorption incidence is not significantly different between the two groups .",
    "the statistics are illustrated in where it is shown that any significant red  shifted absorption is almost completely absent from the hbe sample ( symbols above the horizontal dotted line ) .",
    "there is only one early b ",
    "type object ( hd 200775 , a b4 star ) that displays a red  shifted absorption profile .",
    "note that mwc 137 is included in the figure ( right most left  facing purple triangle ) , although it is excluded from the statistics in due to the lack of a reliable rv estimate .",
    "the hae stars show a diverse variety of both pc and ipc profiles , indicating greater overall levels of accretion and outflow activity .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ]        although the differences in line profile morphology are not statistically significant for our sample , provides a hint that physical differences do exist between the hae and hbe environments .",
    "thus we argue that our data add to the recent evidence suggesting that there is a distinction between hae and hbe stars concerning the circumstellar environment within a few stellar radii of the star .",
    "the late b ",
    "type objects are likely more similar to hae stars than to early b  type objects",
    ". the greater incidence of ipc profiles in hae stars suggests that mass accretion in a substantial fraction of these objects is occurring along magnetic field lines .",
    "hbe objects show a much lower incidence of ipc morphologies , although the sample size is small .",
    "outflows seem to be present in similar numbers in both populations .",
    "the observed differences in the line profile statistics could be due to differing physical conditions in the immediate circumstellar environments of hae and hbe stars .",
    "on the other hand , if the conditions around both groups of objects are similar , our data would indicate that accretion in hbe objects , and potentially some hae stars , is occurring through a different mechanism , e.g. a boundary layer at the stellar surface .",
    "this was been previously suggested by @xcite .",
    "boundary layer accretion would naturally explain the relative lack of red  shifted absorption features in hbe stars .",
    "the questions concerning the physical conditions in the immediate circumstellar environment can be further addressed with a larger sample size using optical and uv data .",
    "we are currently pursuing this ( cauley & johns  krull 2014 , in prep ) .",
    "if boundary layer accretion is partially responsible for the lack of red  shifted absorption signatures in hbe stars , and possibly for the smaller observed incidence in hae stars compared to cttss , a natural question arises : can boundary layer accretion drive outflows in the same way as ma since outflows are seen in an appreciable fraction of both hae and hbe stars ?",
    "the luminosity released by the boundary layer differs from the luminosity of a magnetically channeled funnel flow by a negligible factor , at least for reasonable stellar parameters .",
    "thus the energy required to drive outflows from near or at the stellar surface is readily available in the boundary layer paradigm",
    ". in current 3d mhd models of accretion  generated outflows around ttss , magnetic fields provide the main acceleration mechanism and geometric constraint for the expanding wind ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as we have pointed out , there is currently no observational support for the existence of magnetic fields on the majority of haebes which are required to drive and support these flows .",
    "however , it has also been suggested that accretion  powered stellar winds are driven by a combination of thermal and centrifugal effects , the thermal effects being driven by the accretion  heated stellar corona @xcite .",
    "alfvn waves excited by accreting material may also play a role in driving the wind , although this mechanism also requires a magnetic field .",
    "x  ray observations have shown a fraction ( @xmath050% ) of haebes to be x  ray emitters , although this is an upper limit since it is unclear if the x  ray emission is intrinsic to the haebes or from unresolved low ",

    "* ) and the moderate fraction of x  ray emitters detected suggests that most haebes do not have sufficiently active coronae to drive strong alfvn waves or thermal winds .",
    "it is unclear what effect the deposition of energy near the stellar equator will have compared to the higher latitudes that are characteristic of magnetically channeled accretion .",
    "however , one possible scenario is the x  celerator mechanism proposed by @xcite in which a wind is driven from a boundary layer at the interface between a star rotating near break  up velocity and an accretion disk .",
    "many haebes have measured _ _",
    "v__sin_i _ values that are significant fractions of their break  up velocities .",
    "these boundary layer outflows , however , also require a magnetic field at the interaction region , although the required field strengths are small enough ( @xmath01020 g for typical haebe parameters ; @xcite ) to be within the current observational uncertainties for many objects @xcite .",
    "the high detection rate of pc profiles for accreting stars in our sample indicates that stellar winds are common among accreting haebes .",
    "although our data are not conclusive , the indication that the pc objects are not accreting magnetically lends itself to the boundary layer accretion  driven stellar wind scenario .",
    "these winds are likely generated partially by the high rotation rates of haebes .",
    "thus we tentatively conclude that boundary layer accretion in haebes , assisted by centrifgual acceleration , is able to drive strong stellar winds .",

    "a smaller sample of 15 objects was presented by @xcite with an even larger incidence ( 87% , or 13 of 15 objects ) of red  shifted absorption in at least one line diagnostic .",

    "velocity components is detected in almost all cttss ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating the presence of extended collimated outflows .",
    "similar line profiles are detected at a much lower rate in haebes : @xcite found only 15% of their 56 haebes display this characteristic while @xcite find evidence of blue  shifted forbidden line emission in only 3%of their sample .",
    "our sample continues the trend of disparate line morphology statistics between haebes and cttss .",
    "in particular , outflows in both hae and hbe stars seem to be much less common than in cttss while ma signatures are present in a similar but slightly lower rate in hae stars compared to cttss .",
    "hbe stars show a considerably lower rate of red  shifted absorption signatures .",
    "these conclusions are confirmed by the contingency test @xmath24values given in .",
    "the tests provide strong evidence that the rates of occurrence of these mass flow signatures differ between the two mass regimes and perhaps between hae and hbe stars , although the statistical evidence is weaker for the differences between the haebe subgroups .",
    "based on the data then , it appears that the immediate circumstellar environments of haebes and cttss can not be treated identically as a general rule .",
    "the differences in morphology statistics between haebes and cttss may be caused in part by smaller magnetospheres mediating the star ",
    "disk interaction in hae and some hbe stars , as suggested by the results in  5.1.2 .",
    "in addition , this would lead to a lower incidence of red  shifted absorption signatures in haebes , which is observed , due to fewer viewing angles that intersect the infalling part of the flow .",
    "the differing statistics may also be a result of the varying stages of pre  main sequence evolution included in our sample : we simply may not be comparing objects at similar enough stages of evolution , although we have attempted to remove the most obvious imposters from our sample .",
    "more precise evolutionary subclasses for haebes , similar to those for wttss and cttss , may account for the differences in line statistics observed here .    as outlined in  2",

    "* we find that there appear to be differences between the line profile properties of hbe stars compared to hae stars . in particular , hbe objects tend to display blue absorption with little evidence for infalling material ; the hae sample shows both blue and red shifted absorption features indicating overall higher levels of mass flow activity .",

    "none of the objects in our sample with clear red  shifted absorption show signs of blue absorption , it is unclear whether or not these objects are capable of launching accretion  generated outflows . * the red  shifted absorption profiles in our sample show maximum absorption velocities that are smaller percentages of the system escape velocity than is found in cttss , suggesting these mass inflows originate closer to the star .",
    "this may be a result of more compact magnetospheres in haebes resulting in smaller disk truncation radii .",
    "this is expected for the magnetospheric accretion scenario for haebes due to their high rotation rates and weak or nonexistent magnetic fields . *",
    "none of the objects in our sample show any sign of narrow blue  shifted absorption indicative of pure disk winds , which are common at in cttss .",
    "we interpret these results as evidence that the inner environments around haebes can not be considered scaled analogues of ctts environments .",
    "more specifically , the magnetocentrifugally driven winds that are , theoretically , launched from near the interaction region of the stellar magnetosphere and accretion disk in cttss are not clearly indicated in haebes or are too weak to be detected in our data .",
    "this is supported by the lack of detected magnetic fields on haebes .",
    "instead , stellar winds seem to be the only outflow mechanism for the objects in our sample . however , magnetocentrifugally driven ouflows from the star  disk interaction region can appear as stellar winds if the interaction region is near enough to the star .",
    "thus these outflows can not be ruled out based on the data presented here .",
    "we find that for haebes that do show outflow signatures , these can be driven from smaller magnetospheres than required for cttss .",
    "finally , since stellar magnetic fields are either absent or too weak to be detected around most haebes , and since we detect no disk wind signatures in our sample , we suggest that the magnetic fields involved in launching disk winds in cttss are stellar in origin and not disk  generated or primordial .",
    "this would naturally explain the lack of obvious disk winds in haebes and their common appearance in ctts systems .",
    "one potential cause for the differences between profile statistics in hae and hbe stars and between haebes and cttss is the likely spread of evolutionary stages present in the current catalog of haebes",
    ". the more rapid evolution of haebes , and especially hbe stars , compared to cttss results in a smaller chance of observing a particular haebe at any stage of its contraction towards the main sequence .",

    "@xcite suggested an evolutionary classification for haebes based on ir colors similar to the groupings given by @xcite .",
    "the relevant ctts phase in the @xcite scheme would be panels ( b ) and ( c ) of their figure 3 .",
    "a comparison of objects within these sub  groups may be more precise than the analysis presented here . however , a larger sample size than the one presented in this work would be needed to make such a comparison meaningful .",

    "data sets of this type , to our knowledge , have not been published .",
    "similar sample sizes of these data for cttss and haebes would facilitate an excellent comparison between the wind launching and accretion regions for the two groups and help clarify the origin of the statistical differences of line profile type presented in this work .",
    "we are presently pursuing this for a small sample of haebes .",
    "the lack of observed wind signatures in the ipc objects in our sample is puzzling considering the high rate ( 76% from ) of cttss showing both red  shifted absorption and blue - shifted absorption . we are currently analyzing a large sample of optical and uv haebe data .",

    "<S> , evidence is found for smaller magnetospheres in the maximum red  shifted absorption velocities in our haebe sample . </S>",
    "<S> these velocities are , on average , a smaller fraction of the system escape velocity than is found for cttss , suggesting accretion is taking place closer to the star . </S>",
    "<S> smaller magnetospheres , and evidence for boundary layer accretion in hbe stars , may explain the less common occurrence of red  shifted absorption in haebes . </S>",
    "<S> evidence is found that smaller magnetospheres may be less efficient at driving outflows compared to ctts magnetospheres . </S>"
