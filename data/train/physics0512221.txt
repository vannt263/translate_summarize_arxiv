    "consider a discrete - time random walk in which the length of each step is uniformly distributed in the range @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "we term this process the uniform random walk ( urw ) .",
    "the walker is initially at an arbitrary point @xmath2 in the unit interval [ 0,1 ] and the endpoints are absorbing . for the urw , an absorbing boundary is defined such that if the walk crosses an endpoint of the interval , the walk is trapped exactly at this endpoint .",
    "we are interested in the first - passage properties of this urw .",
    "one motivation for this study comes from the problem of dna sequence recognition by a mobile protein @xcite .",
    "the protein molecule typically seeks its target by a combination of diffusion along the dna chain , and also detachment and subsequent reattachment of the protein at a point many base pairs away , and the basic quantity of interest is the time required for the protein to find its target on a finite dna chain @xcite . the two mechanisms of diffusion and detachment / reattachment can be viewed as a random walk along the chain with a variable step length distribution @xcite .",
    "this is the viewpoint that we shall adopt for this work .",
    "a second motivation for our work is that when individual step lengths are drawn from a continuous distribution , the resulting random walk exhibit a variety of interesting properties beyond those of the discrete random walk .",
    "these include , among others , both unusual first - passage properties @xcite as well as extreme - value phenomena @xcite .    here",
    "we study the related problem of first - passage properties of the urw in a finite interval .",
    "perhaps the most basic such feature is the exit probability @xmath3 , defined as the probability for a walk that starts at @xmath2 to eventually cross the boundary at @xmath4 .",
    "since the probability to exit via the left boundary is @xmath5 , we need only consider exit to the right boundary , for which we reserve the term exit probability .",
    "a related quantity is the mean exit time @xmath6 , defined as the average time to exit the interval at either boundary when the walk starts from @xmath2 .",
    "this exit time from an interval has been investigated for a random walk with general single - step hopping probabilities @xcite and also in an econophysics context @xcite . as we shall see , the interplay between the maximum step size and the interval length leads to commensuration effects that are absent when the step length distribution extends over an infinite range .",
    "for both pure diffusion and the classical random walk with the step length @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is an arbitrary integer , it is well known that the exit probability from an absorbing interval is @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "similarly , the mean exit time is @xmath10 , where the diffusion coefficient for the discrete random walk is @xmath11 , with @xmath12 the mean - square length of a single step .",
    "we now determine these first - passage properties  the exit probability and the exit time  for the urw .",
    "to help visualize the general behavior , we performed numerical simulations of the urw by a probability propagation algorithm ; for the urw , this approach is orders of magnitude more efficient than direct monte carlo simulation . in probability propagation , we first divide the unit interval into @xmath8 discrete points .",
    "we correspondingly discretize the urw as follows : a urw that moves uniformly within the range @xmath0 $ ] at each step is equivalent to its discretized counterpart hopping equiprobably to any one of the @xmath13 discrete points on either side of the current site .",
    "when an element of probability hops outside the interval , this element is considered to be trapped at the boundary where the element left the interval .",
    "we continue this propagation until less than @xmath14 of the initial probability remains in the interval . running",
    "the propagation further led to insignificant corrections .",
    "the simulations were generally performed with @xmath15 .",
    "we found negligible differences in our results when the interval was discretized into @xmath16 points .",
    "this probability propagation algorithm is also considerably more efficient than naive monte carlo simulation of an ensemble of random walkers .",
    "when @xmath1 is of the order of 1 , non - diffusive features arise because the walk can traverse the interval in just a few steps . in the limit @xmath17 , @xmath18 for all @xmath2 ; that is , either boundary is reached equiprobably , independent of the initial position .",
    "conversely , for @xmath19 , the first - passage properties of the urw approach those of continuum diffusion .",
    "thus @xmath20 , except when the starting point is close to a boundary ( fig .",
    "[ exit ] ) . in this boundary region , @xmath3 undergoes a series of transitions in which the @xmath21 derivative is discontinuous whenever @xmath2 or @xmath22 passes through @xmath23 .",

    "the unfairness arises because when a walk crosses the boundary and ostensibly lands outside the interval , the walk is reassigned to be trapped at the edge of the interval .",
    "thus the mean position of the probability distribution is not conserved .",
    "another consequence of the unfairness is that the exit probability @xmath29 for fixed @xmath1 , no matter how small , is non - zero .",
    "the possibility of starting at @xmath30 and exiting at @xmath4 can be viewed as an effective bias of the walk toward the middle of the interval . in the context of the gambler s ruin problem @xcite , a gambler that is about to be ruined appears",

    "this limiting behavior again reflects the fact that there is a non - negligible probability for a walk that starts at one edge of the interval to exit via the opposite edge , a process that requires a non - zero time .",
    "in general , the exit probability may be determined from the backward equation that expresses the exit probability @xmath3 in terms of the exit probability after one step of the random walk has elapsed @xcite .",
