    "in this paper we study dimensional theoretical properties of a kind of skew product maps with coupled - expanding property . by dimensional theoretical properties we mean hausdorff dimension of invariant sets of dynamical systems and ergodic measures on these sets .    in the modern theory of dynamical systems",
    "geometrical invariants like hausdorff dimension of invariant sets and measures seem to have their place beside classical invariants like entropy and lyapnov exponents @xcite . in the dimension",
    "theoretical study on dynamical systems , following two problems are regarded as important .",
    "the first one is to estimate hausdorff dimension of invariant sets .",
    "the second one is the problem about existence of ergodic measure with full hausdorff dimension in these invariant sets . if such an ergodic measure does not exist , it is problem whether at least the variational principle for hausdorff dimension holds or not .",
    "the variational principle means that there exists a sequence of ergodic measures such that the hausdorff dimension of the invariant set can be approximated by their hausdorff dimensions .",
    "it seems to be well accepted by experts that these questions are of great important in developing the dimension theory of dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "the problem of estimating the hausdorff dimension of invariant subsets has been studied in several papers for different classes of dynamical system ( a good overview can be found in @xcite ) . in @xcite , for some noninjective skew product maps defined on a square without finite markov partition , the author estimated hausdorff dimension of attractor under some conditions . in generally the skew product map",
    "@xmath0 with @xmath1 \\times [ 0,1]$ ] is defined by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 \\to [ a , b]$ ] is piecewise monotonic and the map @xmath4 is a contraction on @xmath5 $ ] for all @xmath6 $ ] . in @xcite",
    ", it was proved that for the skew product map @xmath7 , hausdorff dimension of the attractor @xmath8 of @xmath9 is @xmath10 under some conditions , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the topological entropy of @xmath13 .    on the other hand baker s map which can be considered as a special form of the skew product map is well known as a simple example of a `` chaotic '' dynamical system .",
    "when it comes to dimensional theoretical study for this map , in @xcite it was considered that , for parameters in some domain , baker s transformation has ergodic measures with full hausdorff dimension in its invariant sets but , for parameters in some other domain , variational principle for hausdorff dimension does nt hold , that is , there is not a sequence of ergodic measures of which hausdorff dimension approximates the hausdorff dimension of the invariant set . in @xcite",
    "more improved results than one in @xcite on the dimensional theoretical properties of the generalized baker s map were obtained .    according to our search on prior works",
    ", it seems that there is no result considered for the existence problem of ergodic measure with full hausdorff dimension or for the problem on variational principle for hausdorff dimension for the skew product map yet , whereas such work has done for the baker s map . and",
    "in @xcite rather strong condition including continuously differentiability for the map @xmath13 and @xmath14 was supposed .",
    "when it comes to coupled - expanding property , strictly coupled - expanding map implies `` chaos '' in several senses ( see @xcite ) .    from the above mentioned results , in this paper we study on dimensional theoretical properties for a kind of skew product maps @xmath7 where @xmath13 is a coupled - expanding map .",
    "we estimate hausdorff dimension of the attractor of the skew product map @xmath9 ( in section 3 ) and prove that there exists ergodic measure with full hausdorff dimension in the attractor for the map @xmath9 ( in section 4 ) .",

    "suppose that @xmath51 \\to [ a , b]$ ] is monotonic on @xmath52\\cup [ d , b ] ( a < c < d < b)$ ] and satisfies @xmath53)=t([d , b])=[a , b]$ ] and @xmath54 .",
    "assume that @xmath55 and that @xmath56 \\to [ 1/2 , 1- \\lambda /2]$ ] is strictly monotonic and satisfies @xmath57 . then the attractor @xmath58 of the map @xmath9 defined by @xmath59 \\times [ 0,1]$ ] , has hausdorff dimension @xmath60    * ( remark 1 ) * from the conditions of theorem 3.1 , the map @xmath51 \\to [ a , b]$ ] is strictly expanding map ( see @xcite ) and therefore the entropy of @xmath13 is @xmath61 ( @xcite ) .",
