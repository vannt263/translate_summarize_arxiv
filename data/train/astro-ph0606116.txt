    "the increasing availability of survey fields with deep multi - wavelength data has led to so - called `` dropout '' techniques becoming established for photometrically identifying high - redshift galaxies . at redshifts of @xmath10",
    "it is now standard practice to select galaxy candidates using the @xmath11drop technique , a straightforward extension of the lyman - break method pioneered at @xmath12 by guhathakurta , tyson & majewski ( 1990 ) and steidel & hamilton ( 1992 ) . within this context",
    ", the unique combination of depth and image quality provided by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) has arguably made the largest contribution to our understanding of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "analysis of the hubble deep fields , the goods fields , and in particular the hubble ultra - deep field ( hudf ) , has led to the identification of hundreds of @xmath11drop galaxy candidates at faint ( @xmath13 ) magnitudes ( e.g. bouwens et al .",

    ", we now have a vastly improved understanding of the galaxies which undoubtedly dominate the star - formation density of the universe during the epoch immediately following reionisation .",
    "however , although hst has greatly advanced our knowledge of high - redshift galaxies , the various hst deep fields suffer from one fundamental weakness .",
    "crucially , their small area ( e.g. the hudf covers @xmath1413 square  arcmin ) makes them subject to significant cosmic variance ( somerville et al .",
    "2004 ) and completely unsuitable for investigating the most luminous , rarest objects . indeed , of the many hundreds of @xmath11drop galaxies identified in the deep hst fields , only one has @xmath15",

    "this is an important shortcoming because accurately determining the number density of massive galaxies at high - redshift ( @xmath0 ) has the potential to place important new constraints on galaxy formation models , only 1 gyr after the big bang . from an observational perspective",

    "the study of @xmath10 lbgs in the subaru deep field ( sdf ; maihara et al .",
    "2001 ) by shimasaku et al .",
    "( 2005 ) is perhaps the most notable .",
    "based on deep subaru optical imaging covering 767 square  arcmin , shimasaku et al . identified twelve bright lbgs with @xmath1-band magnitudes in the range 25.4@xmath18@xmath1@xmath1826.6 ,",
    "photometrically selected to lie in the redshift range @xmath19 . moreover , by using two medium - band filters ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) which divide the subaru @xmath1-prime filter in half , shimasaku et al . gained crucial information on the uv slope of their high - redshift candidates . as a consequence , shimasaku et al .",
    "were able to select a very clean sample , which should have negligible contamination from low - redshift interlopers .",
    "in addition , ota et al .",
    "( 2005 ) performed a search for @xmath1@xmath22 lbgs over a sky area of @xmath23 square  degree in the sxds field , using a primary selection criterion of @xmath24 .",
    "however , ota et al . were only able to strongly constrain the surface density of lbg candidates at @xmath25 , because at brighter magnitudes their lack of near - infrared data made it impossible to exclude significant contamination from low - redshift interlopers , and cool galactic stars in particular .",
    "finally , it should be noted that there is already evidence for a large population of @xmath10 galaxies at fainter @xmath26band magnitudes within the sxds / uds field . using a combination of the broad @xmath27band sxds imaging and a narrow band filter ( @xmath28 ) , ouchi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) identified 515 potential ly@xmath29 emitters ( laes ) within the redshift interval @xmath30 , over an area of one square  degree .",
    "further deep optical spectroscopy subsequently confirmed eight laes at @xmath31 with asymmetric emission lines .",
    "however , the laes detected by ouchi et al .",
    "are fainter ( @xmath25 ) than the objects identified in this study ( and presumably have lower mass ) .",
    "in this paper we exploit two crucial advantages of the combined sxds / uds data - set to explore a new area of lbg parameter space at @xmath0 .",
    "firstly , the overlap region between the sxds and the uds edr is @xmath32 times larger than the sdf ( @xmath33 square  degrees ) , offering the prospect of identifying the rarest @xmath0 lbgs with @xmath34 .",
    "secondly , the near - infrared data from the uds edr allows us to effectively clean the sample of low - redshift contaminants , and to obtain stellar mass estimates for the lbg candidates .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a brief review of the optical and near - infrared data currently available in the sxds / uds field . in section 3",
    "we outline the criteria adopted for selecting the @xmath35 galaxy candidates , and discuss the possible sources of contamination . in section 4 we present the results of our modelling of the candidates spectral energy distributions ( seds ) . in section 5",
    "we estimate the number densities of massive lbgs at @xmath0 and compare with the predictions of current galaxy formation models . in section 6",
    "we compare our results with those in the recent literature , before presenting our conclusions in section 7 . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt the following cosmology : @xmath36 kms@xmath37mpc@xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "when referring to the @xmath40  and @xmath41band filters , @xmath42 and @xmath1 specifically refer to the subaru filters , whereas @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the equivalent hst filters .",
    "in this paper we identify potential massive galaxies at high redshift by combining optical data from the subaru telescope with near - infrared data from the uk infrared telescope ( ukirt ) .",
    "the optical data were taken as part of the subaru / xmm - newton deep survey ( sekiguchi et al .",
    "2005 ) while the near - infrared data has been taken from the early - data release ( dye et al . 2006 ) of the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( lawrence et al .",
    "the properties of both data - sets are briefly outlined below .      the subaru / xmm - newton deep survey ( sxds ) primarily consists of optical and x - ray imaging covering an area of @xmath45  square degrees , centred on ra=02:18:00 , dec=-05:00:00 ( j2000 ) .",
    "in addition , the sxds field has irac and mips data from the spitzer swire survey ( lonsdale et al .",
    "2003 ) , deep 1.4 ghz radio observations from the vla ( simpson et al . 2006a ) and 850-micron",
    "sub - mm observations from scuba ( mortier et al . 2005 ) .",
    "of primary concern for this study is the deep optical imaging of the field undertaken with suprime - cam ( miyazaki et al .",
    "2002 ) on subaru .",
    "the optical imaging consists of 5 over - lapping suprime - cam pointings , and covers an area of @xmath45  square degrees .",
    "the whole field has been imaged in the @xmath46 filters , to typical @xmath47 depths of @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( 2@xmath53diameter apertures ) .",
    "the ultra deep survey ( uds ) is one of five near - infrared surveys being undertaken with wfcam ( casali et al .",
    "2006 , in preparation ) on ukirt , which together comprise the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss )",
    ". the uds will take seven years to complete , and will provide ultra - deep @xmath54 imaging of a 0.8 square  degree area ( centred on the sxds field ) , to @xmath47 point - source limits of @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the uds early - data release consists of the first twelve hours of @xmath58 imaging data and reaches @xmath47 limits of @xmath59 and @xmath60 within a 2@xmath53diameter aperture . for this paper",
    "we have used an improved version of stacking and catalogue extraction constructed by the current authors , rather than the default version in the wfcam science archive .",
    "this will be described in foucaud et al ( 2006 ) .",
    "the authors of this paper are also members of the ukidss consortium , so we intend that our improved stacking and source extraction will be made available to help to develop the final wsa database . due to a small change in the uds field centre shortly after the beginning of the survey , the current @xmath58 imaging is not uniform over the entire 0.8 square  degree field .",
    "consequently , for the purposes of this paper , we restrict our analysis to the @xmath61  square  degree central region which has uniform @xmath58 data and optical subaru coverage .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in table 2 we list the best - fitting galaxy template parameters resulting from the optical+near - infrared sed fits to each of the final nine high - redshift lbg candidates ( as illustrated in fig 1 ) .",
    "all of the candidates have best - fitting photometric redshifts in the range @xmath5 , validating our original selection criteria .",
    "moreover , as previously discussed , none of the candidates displays a plausible low - redshift solution , despite the fact that an extreme range of intrinsic reddening ( @xmath62 ) was explored during the sed fitting process .",
    "this is potentially crucial because , as highlighted by dunlop , cirasuolo & mclure ( 2006 ) , it is possible to confuse extremely dusty ( @xmath63 ) low - redshift objects with genuine high - redshift galaxies if the range of reddening explored is constrained to moderate values ( e.g. @xmath64 ) .",
    "although the age of the universe at @xmath65 ( @xmath66 gyrs ) was not used as a prior in the model fitting , reassuringly the best - fitting ages for all the final nine candidates naturally satisfy this constraint , and are consistent with formation redshifts in the range @xmath67 . as is expected given the lbg selection criteria , there is no evidence in our sample for substantial amounts of reddening .",
    "indeed , the range of reddening displayed by our sample ( @xmath68 ) is perfectly consistent with that found for lbgs at @xmath12 by shapley et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .      by concentrating exclusively on the brightest ( @xmath34 ) candidates",
    ", this study was designed to investigate the most massive lbgs at @xmath0 .",
    "the success of this policy can be seen from table 2 , which shows that six of the nine final candidates have estimated stellar masses @xmath69 , and five have estimated masses @xmath70 .",
    "if these stellar mass estimates are accurate , then the lbg candidates are among the most massive galaxies yet discovered at these redshifts ( see discussion in section 5 ) , and are comparable to the highest stellar masses found for lbgs at @xmath12 by shapley et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who also adopted a salpeter imf .",
    "in fact , these stellar mass estimates suggest that several of the @xmath0 lbg candidates have already built - up a stellar mass comparable with m@xmath71 today ( @xmath72 ; cole et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "however , given the current depth of the near - infrared data from the uds edr , and the fact that the swire data covering the uds field is not deep enough to individually detect the lbg candidates , it is clear that on an object - by - object basis the stellar mass estimates must be regarded with some caution .",
    "the first issue to consider is the range of stellar masses which are allowable within the sed templates we have adopted to fit the optical+near - infrared photometry . by identifying the sed templates with the lowest and highest masses which still provide a statistically acceptable fit to the observed photometry ( conservatively @xmath73 , marginalised over all other free parameters ) , we have calculated the allowable stellar mass range for each of the lbg candidates ( table 2 ) .",
    "this calculation reveals that the photometry of most of the lbg candidates can be acceptably reproduced ( although with a worse @xmath74 ) by sed templates with a factor of @xmath75 less stellar mass .",
    "in addition , there is also the added uncertainty introduced by the choice of a specific imf . for the sed fits presented in this paper we have made the standard choice of adopting a salpeter imf , for ease of comparison with previous results in the literature .",
    "however , it is widely recognised that the salpeter imf results in higher stellar mass estimates than other popular choices . for example",
    ", re - fitting the lbg optical+near - infrared photometry with a kennicutt or chabrier imf would produce stellar mass estimates a factor of @xmath76 lower . in conclusion",
    ", it is clear that the individual stellar mass estimates for the lbg candidates are very likely uncertain to within a factor of @xmath77 .    in order to obtain a more robust estimate of the typical mass of the @xmath0 lbgs , we have also calculated stellar mass estimates based on the stacked lbg photometry .",
    "the obvious advantage of this is that the extra depth provided by stacking produces much more robust photometry in the @xmath78 and @xmath79bands , and also provides a detection at 3.6@xmath80 m from the stacked swire data . using a straightforward average stack of the lbg data ( see figs 2 & 3 ) our sed fit returns a stellar mass estimate of @xmath81 .",
    "however , this stack is biased due to the inclusion of the two lbg candidates with the lowest stellar mass estimates ( mcd1 & mcd8 ) , which have the faintest @xmath82 photometry .",
    "this is confirmed by an sed fit to a median stack of the lbg photometry , which returns a stellar mass estimate of @xmath83 ( as anticipated from the results in table 2 ) . in conclusion ,",
    "taking into account systematic differences due to the choice of imf , the evidence from stacking the lbg data suggests a typical stellar mass of @xmath6 .",
    "the results presented in the previous section suggest that , despite the considerable uncertainties , the typical stellar mass of the @xmath0 lbg candidates is @xmath6 . in this section",
    "we investigate whether the existence of such massive galaxies at this early epoch is consistent with @xmath7cdm structure formation and current galaxy formation models . within this section",
    "we adopt the best - fitting stellar mass estimates for each lbg candidate , based on a salpeter imf .",
    "however , when necessary , we adjust our estimated number densities to account for differences due to specific choices of imf .",
    "the first , model independent , quantity of interest to calculate is the surface density of @xmath34 galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "however , in order to accurately compute the surface density , it is first necessary to account for the inevitable incompleteness introduced during the construction of the original sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) catalogues due to object blending . to quantify this effect we performed simulations based on introducing 1000 fake lbg candidates at a time into the @xmath26band images , and attempting to recover them using the same sextractor configuration adopted for constructing the original @xmath26band catalogues",
    "this immediately revealed that on average we lose @xmath84 of possible lbg candidates due to object blending on the @xmath26band images .",
    "in addition , we then proceeded to run sextractor in two - image mode on the corresponding @xmath85 and @xmath86band data , using the @xmath26band as the detection image .",
    "this revealed that we lose further lbg candidates due to contamination of the matched apertures in the @xmath85 and @xmath86bands by nearby companions . in around @xmath87 of cases this contamination is sufficient to fail our selection criteria requiring @xmath88 detections in both the @xmath85 and @xmath86bands .",
    "consequently , when calculating the surface density of @xmath34 lbgs it is necessary to scale - up by a factor of @xmath89 . allowing for this correction factor ,",
    "our estimate for the surface density of @xmath34 lbgs at @xmath0 is @xmath4 per square  arcmin .",
    "we note that this figure is compatible with , although obviously much more robust than , a prediction based on the one previously known @xmath0 lbg with @xmath15 in a compilation of deep hst survey fields ; @xmath90 per square  arcmin ( bouwens et al .",
    "we also note that our final list of nine @xmath34 lbgs at @xmath0 is fully consistent with the previous findings of shimasaku et al .",
    "( 2005 ) in the sdf . within the 767 square arcmin area of the sdf , shimasaku et al .",
    "did not find any possible @xmath34 lbgs , but did identify 12 candidates in the magnitude range @xmath91 .",
    "however , it is important to remember that the selection technique adopted by shimasaku et al .",
    "was tuned to identify lbgs in the redshift interval @xmath19 .",
    "only one of our final list of nine candidates lies within this redshift range ( mcd1 ) . consequently , based on our final sample",
    ", we would predict only @xmath92 lbg candidates with @xmath34 within the sdf area which would satisfy the shimasaku et al .",
    "selection criteria , entirely consistent with their finding of none .",
    "the best - fitting stellar mass estimates listed in table 2 suggest that five of the lbg candidates have masses of m @xmath93 . in order to convert the estimated surface density of m @xmath93 lbgs at @xmath0 into a number density , it is necessary to compute the effective co - moving volume of our survey ( defined by the survey area and the redshift intervals",
    "within which each of the lbg candidates could have been detected ; @xmath94 ) . due to our adopted optical selection criteria ,",
    "our selection function has a sharp low - redshift cut - off at @xmath95 . to compute @xmath96",
    "we have taken the sed fit to each candidate and redshifted it ( keeping age , reddening and mass constant ) until the candidate fades below our magnitude limit ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "this calculation reveals that , for the five lbg candidates with m @xmath93 , the effective volume of the survey is equivalent to the full co - moving volume covered by our 0.6 square  degree area over the redshift interval @xmath98 ( i.e.  @xmath99mpc@xmath100 ) .",
    "additionally , in order to calculate a meaningful estimate of the number density of m @xmath93 lbgs in our sample , it is also necessary to estimate our completeness as a function of stellar mass . to investigate this we produced simulated photometry for 10,000 lbgs with parameters randomly selected from uniform distributions with the following ranges :    * stellar masses : @xmath101 m @xmath102 * ages : 50 myr @xmath18 age @xmath18 500 myr * extinction : @xmath103    where the adopted parameter ranges are based on the results of the sed fits presented in table 2 , and are also consistent ( in terms of ages ) with recent results suggesting that reionisation occurred in the redshift interval @xmath104 ( fan et al .",
    "2006 ; page et al .",
    "the simulated lbg catalogue was then subjected to the same optical and near - infrared selection criteria adopted for the real data - set ( see section 3 ) . in fig 5",
    "we show the resulting estimate for sample completeness as a function of stellar mass . it can be seen from this figure that for lbgs with stellar masses of @xmath105 we are only @xmath106 complete . consequently , to calculate our final estimate of the number density of m @xmath93 lbgs within our sample we are required to correct the observed numbers by a factor of @xmath107 . taking this correction into account ,",
    "our final estimate for the number density of m  @xmath93 lbgs at @xmath0 is @xmath108 , where the quoted error includes a 20% contribution from cosmic variance ( somerville et al .",
    "2004 ) , but does not include possible systematics in the adopted completeness correction . if , in reality , lbg candidate mcd3 is an m dwarf contaminant , then the estimate number density would be @xmath109% lower .",
    "the most fundamental test which we can perform is to ask whether @xmath7cdm produces the required number of dark matter halos to host galaxies with stellar masses of @xmath72 at this early epoch . in order to explore this issue",
    "we have calculated the number density of dark matter halos as a function of redshift predicted by the press - schechter formalism ( bond et al .",
    "1991 ) . in fig 6",
    "we show the redshift evolution of the dark matter halo number density for halos more massive than @xmath110 , which corresponds to a stellar to dark matter ratio of 15 .",
    "although the typical stellar to dark matter ratio of massive galaxies as a function of redshift is not accurately known , our choice of 15 as a representative figure is motivated by several lines of reasoning .",
    "firstly , assuming a halo occupation number of unity , the predicted number density of m@xmath111 dark matter halos at @xmath112 is in good agreement with the locally observed number density of galaxies with stellar masses @xmath113 ( salpeter imf ; cole et  al .",
    "moreover , a ratio between halo mass and stellar mass of @xmath114 at low - redshift is in good agreement with recent galaxy - galaxy lensing results ( mandelbaum et al .",
    "2006 ) . finally , at high redshift , a stellar to dark matter ratio of @xmath114 is also in agreement with the predictions of recent galaxy formation models ( r. bower , private communication ) . at high",
    "redshift the number density of dark matter halos is strongly dependent on the value of the @xmath8 parameter .",
    "consequently , in fig 6 we show the dark matter halo number density evolution for four different values of @xmath8 ( 0.90 , 0.85 , 0.80 & 0.75 ) .",
    "the final value of @xmath115 is in agreement with the wmap three year results ( spergel et al . 2006 ) .",
    "in fig 6 we also plot our estimated number density of lbgs with stellar masses @xmath93 from this study ( median @xmath116 ) .",
    "it can be seen from fig 6 that , assuming a stellar to dark matter ratio of 15 , @xmath7cdm does produce sufficient halos at high redshift to host our lbg candidates provided @xmath117 .",
    "in fact , given the large uncertainties associated with our estimated number density , our results are also fully consistent with the latest determination of @xmath115 . consequently , we can conclude that our estimated number density of massive galaxies at @xmath0 can certainly be accommodated within current @xmath7cdm models of structure formation .",
    "furthermore , it has recently been suggested that @xmath118 of the stellar mass at @xmath65 is missed by traditional drop - out selection techniques ( stark et al .",
    "2006 ) , which exclude high - redshift galaxies which are too red in the rest - frame optical to satisfy lbg selection criteria ( see discussion in section 6 ) .",
    "however , even if we increase our estimated number density of massive galaxies at @xmath65 by a factor of two , and assume @xmath115 , @xmath7cdm can still produce the required number of dark matter halos if the stellar to dark matter ratio is @xmath119 .    in fig 6",
    "we also show the estimated number densities of @xmath120 galaxies at @xmath121 derived from a @xmath79band selected sample of galaxies in the goods cdfs ( caputi et al .",
    "the caputi et al .",
    "sample has a magnitude limit of @xmath122 , and is @xmath123% complete for stellar masses @xmath120 ( salpeter imf ) at redshifts @xmath121 . as can be seen from fig 6 , the conclusions of caputi et al .",
    "were that @xmath109% of the local mass density comprised by galaxies with stellar masses @xmath120 was already in place by @xmath124 , and that the majority was in place by @xmath125 .",
    "similar conclusions have been reached by numerous studies of deep , small area , near - infrared surveys ( e.g. drory et al .",
    "2005 ; fontana 2004 ) .",
    "the results presented here strongly suggest that the increase in number density of massive galaxies within the redshift interval @xmath126 closely traces the build - up of suitable dark matter halos and that , as a consequence , only @xmath127 of the local density of @xmath120 galaxies was in place by @xmath65 .",
    "it has recently become apparent that the number density of massive , red galaxies observed at high redshift is much larger than would have been predicted by semi - analytic galaxy formation models five years ago ( e.g. cimatti et al .",
    "2002 ; glazebrook et al .",
    "in essence this is simply a result of the fact that galaxy formation models based on hierarchical assembly naturally produce the most massive galaxies at late times .",
    "this apparent discrepancy between the models and observations has been described variously as `` anti - hierarchical '' behaviour , or cosmic downsizing .",
    "it is clear therefore that important constraints can be placed on the latest generation of galaxy formation models via comparison with the observed number density of massive galaxies already in place at @xmath0 .    in fig 7",
    "we show the predicted number density of galaxies as a function of stellar mass at @xmath116 ( median redshift of our lbg candidates ) from the latest generation of durham semi - analytic galaxy formation models , which incorporate agn feedback ( bower et al .",
    "2006 ) . also shown in fig 7",

    "2006 ) . finally ,",
    "although not included in fig 7 , we also note that our estimated number density of @xmath34 lbgs at @xmath0 is fully consistent with the hydro - dynamical simulations of night et al .",

    "the @xmath41band catalogue is @xmath131 complete to @xmath132 and , although it only covers 142 square arcmin , it is obviously of some interest to compare the number of @xmath0 galaxies found in the music sample to the results presented here .",
    "based on the results of this study , and correcting for the difference in area , the number of @xmath15 lbg - type galaxies within the goods - music catalogue should be consistent with @xmath133 .",
    "interestingly , the goods - music catalogue contains seven objects with @xmath15 and a photometric redshift estimate of @xmath0 , seemingly very inconsistent with the results presented here .",
    "however , our own sed fits to the music photometry for these seven objects suggest that only two are believable high - redshift candidates .",
    "three of the seven objects ( music ids 1133 , 8316 & 12966 ) have seds which are clearly stellar in nature , and have sextractor stellarity parameters of 0.98 , 0.99 and 0.99 respectively .",

    "have two objects with @xmath0 and @xmath15 , one with a spectroscopic redshift of @xmath135 ( music id=3094 ) and the other with a photometric redshift of @xmath136 ( also from the music catalogue ) .",
    "our sed fits to these two objects successfully reproduce the redshift of the spectroscopically confirmed candidate , but are unable to produce a statistically acceptable high - redshift fit to the candidate with @xmath136 . consequently , if we also include sbm03#03 ( @xmath137 ; bunker et al .",
    "2003 ) , we again conclude that the goods - cdfs field contains two @xmath0 objects with @xmath15 .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath138 object in the stark et al .",
    "sample is not a classic @xmath11drop ( @xmath139 ) and would not have passed our strict selection criteria ( estimated colour @xmath140 in the subaru filters ) .",
    "this has two consequences .",
    "firstly , it brings the observed number of @xmath0 lbgs in the goods - cdfs field with @xmath141 into good agreement with the results presented here , which correspond to @xmath133 objects per goods - cdfs area .",
    "secondly , it provides further evidence for the conclusion of stark et al .",
    "( 2006 ) that traditional drop - out selection techniques are missing @xmath118 of the stellar mass at @xmath65 .",
    "finally , yan et al . (",
    "2006 ) have recently completed a study of the stellar mass density at @xmath10 based on @xmath11drop selection of galaxies in the north and south goods fields ( combined area @xmath142 square arcmin ) . within their sample ,",
    "yan et al .",
    "find two objects at @xmath0 with @xmath15 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the results presented in this paper , which correspond to @xmath143 objects per goods field ( n+s ) .      as a final comment we note here that we have found no evidence in this study for the existence of lbgs with masses in excess of @xmath144 in the redshift interval @xmath35 .",
    "although still uncertain , this non - detection is notable given that we should be @xmath118 complete to lbg - type objects of this mass ( see fig 5 ) over a volume of @xmath145mpc@xmath100 .",
    "consequently , the detection of even one object of this mass within the uds / sxds field would have pointed to a number density of @xmath146 .",
    "our non - detection is in agreement with the recent search for @xmath147 galaxies within the goods - cdfs field by dunlop , cirasuolo & mclure ( 2006 ) .",
    "in this paper we have presented the results of a study aimed at exploiting the large co - moving volume of the sxds / uds data - set to identify the most massive lbgs at @xmath0 .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "we have identified a robust sample of nine bright ( @xmath148 ) lbg candidates with photometric redshifts in the range @xmath149 .",
    "our corresponding estimate of the surface density for @xmath148 lbgs at @xmath0 is @xmath4 per square  arcmin .",
    "this surface density estimate is in good agreement with , although much more robust than , a prediction based on the one previously known lbg candidate with @xmath15 in a compilation of the deep hst fields ; @xmath90 per square arcmin ( bouwens et al .",
    "3 .   sed fits to the stacked photometry of the final nine lbg candidates suggests that their typical stellar mass is @xmath6 ( salpeter imf ) , comparable with the most massive galaxies currently known at @xmath0 .",
    "4 .   based on our best - fitting stellar mass estimates ,",
    "five of the nine lbg candidates have estimated stellar masses @xmath93 .",
    "our corresponding estimate for the number density of @xmath0 lbgs with stellar masses @xmath93 is @xmath108 .",
    "this number density is found to be compatible with the density of suitable dark matter halos predicted by @xmath7cdm structure formation models for plausible combinations of @xmath8 and the ratio of stellar to dark matter .",
    "it is found that recent galaxy formation models can account for the existence of such massive galaxies at high redshift , even if lbgs only account for @xmath130 of the total stellar mass at @xmath0 . 7 .   despite the large co - moving volume surveyed ,",
    "no evidence is found for the existence of lbgs with masses in excess of @xmath150 at @xmath0 .",
    "the authors would like to acknowledge richard bower and gian luigi granato for providing their stellar mass function predictions .",
    "the authors would also like to acknowledge nigel hambly and niall deacon for useful discussions on the nature of cool galactic stars and will percival for providing the code to calculate halo number densities .",
