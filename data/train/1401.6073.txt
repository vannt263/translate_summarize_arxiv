    "magnetic nano - clusters and magnetic thin films on non - magnetic substrates are in the focus of experimental and theoretical research since such systems play an ultimate role in technologically relevant magnetic devices .",
    "the dependence of the magnetic ground state of ultrathin films on the quality of the underlying substrate is an interesting and relevant issue .",
    "the study of temperature induced magnetic reversal in thin films and nano - structures is of paramount importance for hard disk and magnetic sensor technologies .",
    "ab initio electronic structure methods already proved to give a proper description of magnetic properties of solids , and these methods are often used to obtain parameters for spin models . using spin model parameters",
    "the description of complex magnetic structures or finite temperature magnetism becomes feasible .",
    "fe thin films on 5@xmath0 transition metal surfaces have been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically . whilst a @xmath5 antiferromagnetic ( afm )",
    "state was discovered for an fe monolayer ( ml ) on bcc w(001 ) surface @xcite , on the bcc ta@xmath6w@xmath7(001 ) surface a crossover was found between afm ( pure w substrate ) and ferromagnetic ( fm ) ( pure ta substrate ) states with the same fe layer relaxation @xcite . on the other hand , previous theoretical studies demonstrated that the magnetic ground state strongly depends on the relaxation of the magnetic overlayer . in case of an fe ml on fcc ir(001 ) , the large layer relaxation leads to a spin spiral ground state @xcite .",
    "an investigation of the magnetism of an fe ml on pt(111 ) and at a pt step - edge also led to the conclusion that the crystallographic structure plays a significant role in the formation of the magnetic structure @xcite .",
    "another mechanism that can affect the magnetic ordering of a monolayer is the hybridization between the monolayer and the substrate .",
    "hardrat et al .",
    "demonstrated the change of the exchange coupling and the magnetic ordering of an fe ml on hcp(0001 ) and fcc(111 ) surfaces of 4@xmath0 and 5@xmath0 transition metals due to the change in @xmath0-band filling @xcite . when increasing the atomic number of the substrate element , the @xmath0-band of the substrate moves downwards with respect to the fermi level while the energetic position of the fe 3@xmath0 band remains roughly unchanged . due to corresponding changes in the hybridization between the substrate 4@xmath0 or 5@xmath0 band and the fe 3@xmath0 band",
    ", the fe spin moment gradually increases towards the brinks of the 4@xmath0 or 5@xmath0 row .",
    "we refer to this effect as the @xmath0-band filling rule .    in the present work we determine the electronic and magnetic properties of an fe ml on the fcc(001 ) , bcc(001 ) and",
    "hcp(0001 ) surfaces of 5@xmath0 transition metals using first principles calculations . in all considered cases",
    "we take into account the inward relaxation of the fe ml .",
    "the layer relaxation was determined by using the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite . in order to get a prediction about the magnetic ground state of the fe ml",
    "we calculate first principles spin model parameters . to obtain the model parameters we use the spin - cluster expansion technique combined with the relativistic disordered local moment ( rdlm ) scheme @xcite .",
    "we study the influence of the isotropic heisenberg couplings on the magnetic ground state as well as the role of dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interactions representing a relativistic correction to the heisenberg model .",
    "the theoretical and computational details are briefly given in section 2 . in sections 3 and 4",
    "our results are presented on the magnetic properties and ground state magnetic structure of an fe ml deposited on different 5@xmath0 transition metal surfaces . in particular , we find for the ta substrate that the fe out - of - plane relaxation itself causes a crossing from the fm to the afm ground state .",
    "the frustration of the antiferromagnetic isotropic exchange interactions on hcp surfaces leads to a nel state in the case of fe / re(0001 ) , whereas , due to large dm interactions , an afm spin spiral state is formed in fe / os(0001 ) .",
    "first principles descriptions of the magnetism of itinerant electron systems mostly rely on the adiabatic decoupling of fast electronic fluctuations characterized by typical hopping times of @xmath8  s from the slow transversal motion of spins with time - scales related to inverse spin - wave frequencies of @xmath9  s @xcite . as further simplification of the theory longitudinal spin - fluctuations are often neglected and the so - called rigid spin approximation is used assigning each atom @xmath10 with a spin moment , @xmath11 with @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "a system of @xmath13 spin moments can then be described by the set of orientations ( spin configurations ) @xmath14 and the ab initio grand potential of the itinerant electrons can be identified as an effective energy expression @xmath15 of the classical spin system @xcite .",
    "the second order approximation to @xmath15 refers to a generalized heisenberg model , @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the second - order anisotropy matrices and tensorial exchange interactions , respectively .",
    "the exchange coupling can be decomposed into an isotropic component , @xmath19 with @xmath20 , an antisymmetric component @xmath21 , and a traceless symmetric part @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and the superscript t label in order the trace and the transpose of a matrix , and @xmath24 is the unit matrix .",
    "as is well - known , @xmath25 is the scalar heisenberg coupling and the energy term @xmath26 corresponds to the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction with @xmath27 being the dm vector @xcite . furthermore , the magnetic anisotropy energy ( mae ) , defined as the energy difference between two uniformly magnetized states of the system , @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xmath30 , can be expressed as a sum of on - site and two - site anisotropies , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33",

    "( [ genheis ] ) .",
    "the relativistic torque method @xcite makes use of infinitesimal rotations around specific magnetic configurations , mostly , around the ferromagnetic state . deriving all elements of the matrices @xmath17 and @xmath18 can , however , be very tedious in case of reduced symmetry within this method .",
    "furthermore , for systems with ground states far from the fm state the derived interaction parameters might be inconsistent with the ground state .",
    "the spin - cluster expansion ( sce ) technique developed by drautz and fhnle @xcite provides a systematic parametrization of the adiabatic magnetic energy that , in principle , avoids the above problems .",
    "the crucial step of the sce is the evaluation of orientational averages of the grand potential restricted to fixed spin - configurations of selected clusters .",
    "these restricted averages can efficiently be elucidated using mean field approximation .",
    "the disordered local moment ( dlm ) scheme of the density functional theory @xcite is an extremely useful mean field description of a magnetic system .",

    "moreover , the perdew - wang ( pw91 ) parametrization of the exchange - correlation functional @xcite was used .",
    "we modelled the fe/5@xmath0 systems by a slab of seven layers ( 1 ml fe + 6 ml 5@xmath0 ) , where the two topmost layers were freely relaxed in the out - of - plane direction .",
    "we used the experimental lattice constants of the substrates and an @xmath36 monkhorst - pack k - point grid for sampling the brillouin zone ( bz ) .    taking the relaxed geometries derived by using vasp we performed self - consistent calculations for the fe monolayer placed on the semi - infinite 5@xmath0 substrates in terms of the screened korringa - kohn - rostoker ( skkr ) method @xcite .",
