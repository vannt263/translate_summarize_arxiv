    "suppressing the noise from collective variables of ensembles composed of two - level systems is known as spin squeezing and constitutes an important resource in quantum metrology @xcite . recently ,",
    "various strategies have been successfully applied to spin squeezing of trapped atoms @xcite , and numerous methods have been suggested theoretically @xcite .",
    "kitagawa and ueda in their pioneering work @xcite introduced the concept of one axis twisting ( oat ) and two axis counter - twisting ( tact ) showing that with the former one can reach the variance of atomic number fluctuations @xmath0 and with the latter @xmath1 .",
    "these values should be compared to the variance of uncorrelated atoms in a spin coherent state @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the total atomic number .",
    "the hamiltonian acting as oat can be expressed in terms of the collective spin operators as @xmath4 and that of tact as @xmath5 ( the precise definition of these operators will be given later ) .",
    "physically , @xmath6 can be formed by pairwise atomic interactions , and the corresponding hamiltonian can for example be obtained from the gross - pitaevskii equation of a two - component system . to our knowledge , the tact hamiltonian has not been realized yet , but several theoretical proposals exist , including combinations of the oat hamiltonian with spin rotations @xcite , and a proposal with an atomic trap with spatially modulated nonlinearity @xcite .    to quantify squeezing , typically the ratio of the variance of a properly chosen spin operator to its value in a spin coherent state is used .",
    "this squeezing parameter @xmath7 can reach values @xmath8 for oat and @xmath9 for tact .",
    "can one go deeper , virtually to zero ?",
    "an interesting option is to start with a spin coherent state in direction @xmath10 and adiabatically change the hamiltonian from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "the coherent state which is the ground state of @xmath10 is then transformed to the ground state of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "for even @xmath3 , this state corresponds to @xmath13 with zero fluctuations , i.e. , a perfectly squeezed state with @xmath14 .",
    "note that the vanishing variance of @xmath15 in the dicke states permits measurements of angular rotation of the collective spin with heisenberg limited resolution ( similarly as with states achievable by tact ) as shown in @xcite .",
    "this approach can be extended to hamiltonians with a linear term , @xmath16 : with a suitably chosen @xmath17 , the ground state is a dicke state with a definite value of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "such states have been discussed for their potential in quantum information processing as well as in quantum metrology @xcite .",
    "recently , much effort has been devoted to theoretical schemes for generation of dicke states @xcite , as well as to their actual production in experiments @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic scenario requires that the process is extremely slow to prevent diabatic transitions to unwanted states .",
    "real systems , however , suffer from decoherence and losses which limit the time available for the process .",
    "several versions of `` shortcuts to adiabaticity '' have been proposed to deal with this problem @xcite : a suitable time variation of the strength of the terms @xmath10 and @xmath6 may thus be implemented to minimize the final population of the unwanted states . however , these schemes work best in the continuous limit with large @xmath3 and are not very useful when the discrete nature of the state becomes important near @xmath18 .",
    "the approach we use here to tackle the problem is inspired by the scheme of counterdiabatic driving first studied by demirplak and rice @xcite and by berry @xcite : for any candidate hamiltonian @xmath19 which varies with time , one can construct a compensating hamiltonian @xmath20 which , when applied together with @xmath19 , causes the state to be at each time an instantaneous eigenstate of @xmath19 .",
    "although one has an explicit formula for @xmath20 , there is often no available way to experimentally achieve such a hamiltonian in the laboratory . to deal with this problem , we start from the method proposed in @xcite which builds suitable approximations of @xmath20 from a set of available operators .",
    "it turns out that dicke states with very high fidelities and very strong squeezing can be achieved by using a few compensating operators which can all be obtained as products of the collective spin operators @xmath21 .",
    "tom modified text such higher order products are not currently available in experiments , however , we discuss how they can be implemented as commutators of available quadratic hamiltonians .",
    "the corresponding sequences combining the quadratic hamiltonian and spin rotations can be viewed as an extension of recent proposals to build tact by sequences of oat and rotations @xcite .",
    "we also give an intuitive picture of the compensating operators by showing how they affect the collective spin vector motion on the bloch sphere .",
    "this work is related to the problem of counterdiabatic driving in the lipkin - meshkov - glick model studied in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these papers which explore symmetry breaking quantum phase transitions in which an initially spin coherent state splits into a schrdinger cat - like superposition , we focus on the opposite end of the hamiltonian spectrum .",
    "this leads to a different strategy in the compensating schemes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
