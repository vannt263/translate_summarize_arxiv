    "<S> we present measurements of time - dependent @xmath0 asymmetries in @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 based on a sample of 535 @xmath5 @xmath6 pairs collected at the @xmath7 resonance with the belle detector at the kekb energy - asymmetric @xmath8 collider . </S>",
    "<S> one neutral @xmath9 meson is fully reconstructed in one of the specified decay channels , and the flavor of the accompanying @xmath9 meson is identified from its decay products . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0-violation parameters for each of the decay modes are obtained from the asymmetries in the distributions of the proper - time intervals between the two @xmath9 decays .    </S>",
    "<S> the standard model ( sm ) decribes @xmath0 violation in @xmath10 meson decays using the complex phase of the @xmath11 cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing matrix  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the sm predicts that for most of the decays that proceed via the quark transitions @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) the relations @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 corresponds to @xmath0-even ( -odd ) final states , hold to a good approximation  @xcite . with physics beyond the sm </S>",
    "<S> , these decays may receive significant contributions that depend on a phase that is different from the sm prediction . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of the effective @xmath24 values , @xmath25 , with @xmath24 obtained from the decays governed by the @xmath26 transition is thus an important test of the sm .    among the final states studied , @xmath27 and @xmath3 are @xmath0-odd modes </S>",

    "<S> the sm expectation for this latter mode is @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the @xmath0-even fraction . </S>",
    "<S> a measurement of @xmath33 was obtained using isospin relation  @xcite with a 357 fb@xmath34 data sample and gives @xmath35 .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , it was found that the direct @xmath0 asymmetries in @xmath36 and @xmath37 differ significantly  @xcite while they were naively expected to be same  @xcite . using the @xmath38 result , </S>",
    "<S> an additional test to understand the situation can be made by comparing the measured @xmath15 value and the value predicted by a sum rule  @xcite using asymmetry measurements from the other @xmath39 decays .    </S>",
    "<S> previous measurements of @xmath0 asymmetries in @xmath19 transitions have been reported by belle  @xcite and babar  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> belle s previously published results of @xmath0 in @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 were based on a 253  fb@xmath34 data sample corresponding to @xmath40 @xmath41 pairs . in this report , we describe improved measurements incorporating an additional 239  fb@xmath34 data sample for a total of 492  fb@xmath34 ( @xmath42 @xmath41 pairs ) .    at the kekb energy - asymmetric @xmath8 ( 3.5 on 8.0 gev ) </S>",
    "<S> collider , the @xmath7 is produced with a lorentz boost of @xmath43 nearly along the electron beamline ( @xmath44 ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath10 and @xmath18 are approximatively at rest in the @xmath7 center - of - mass system ( cms ) , @xmath17 can be determined from the displacement in @xmath44 between the two decay vertices : @xmath45 .    </S>",
    "<S> the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) , an array of aerogel threshold erenkov counters ( acc ) , a barrel - like arrangement of time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecl ) comprised of csi(tl ) crystals located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5  t magnetic field . an iron flux - return located outside of the coil is instrumented to detect @xmath46 mesons and to identify muons ( klm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> two different inner detector configurations were used . for the first sample of 152 @xmath5 @xmath6 pairs , a 2.0 cm radius beampipe and a 3-layer silicon vertex detector </S>",
    "<S> were used ; for the latter 383 @xmath5 @xmath6 pairs , a 1.5 cm radius beampipe , a 4-layer silicon detector and a small - cell inner drift chamber were used  @xcite .    we reconstruct the following @xmath10 decay modes to measure @xmath0 asymmetries : @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we exclude @xmath47 pairs that are consistent with a @xmath48 decay from the @xmath4 sample . </S>",
    "<S> the intermediate meson states are reconstructed from the following decays : @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> charged tracks reconstructed with the cdc , except for tracks from @xmath50 decays , are required to originate from the interaction point ( ip ) . </S>",
    "<S> we distinguish charged kaons from pions based on a kaon ( pion ) likelihood @xmath53 derived from the tof , acc and @xmath54 measurements in the cdc . </S>",
    "<S> photons are identified as isolated ecl clusters that are not matched to any charged track .    </S>",
    "<S> we identify @xmath9 meson decays using the energy difference @xmath55 and the beam - energy constrained mass @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the beam energy in the cms , and @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the cms energy and momentum of the reconstructed @xmath9 candidate , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the signal candidates are selected by requiring 5.27 gev/@xmath60 5.29 gev/@xmath61 and a mode - dependent @xmath62 window . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant background for the @xmath19 signal comes from continuum events ( @xmath63 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we discriminate against this using event topology : continuum events tend to be jet - like in the cms , while @xmath64 events tend to be spherical . </S>",
    "<S> to quantify event topology , we calculate modified fox - wolfram moments and combine them into a fisher discriminant  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate a probability density function ( pdf ) for this discriminant and multiply it by a pdf for @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the polar angle in the cms between the @xmath9 direction and the beam axis . </S>",
    "<S> the pdfs for signal and continuum are obtained from monte carlo ( mc ) simulation and a data sideband , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> figures  [ fig_yield].(a)-(l ) show the reconstructed variables @xmath69 , @xmath62 and @xmath70 after flavor tagging and vertex reconstruction ( before vertex reconstruction for the decay @xmath71 ) ; the corresponding signal yields are summarized in table  [ tab_yield ] .    .estimated signal yields @xmath72 in the signal region for each mode .
