    "the schwarz - christoffel mapping to polygonal domains is an important result in the theory of complex - valued functions and one that finds numerous applications in applied mathematics , physics , and engineering @xcite .",
    "the applicability of schwarz - christoffel formula is nonetheless limited by the fact that it pertains only to simply connected polygonal domains .",
    "therefore , there has long been considerable interest in extending the schwarz - christoffel transformation to multiply connected polygonal domains .",
    "recently , explicit formulae for generalized schwarz - christoffel mappings from a circular domain to both bounded and unbounded multiply connected polygonal regions have been obtained using two equivalent approaches . using reflection arguments , delillo and collaborators",
    "@xcite derived infinite product formulae for the generalized schwarz - christoffel mappings , whereas crowdy @xcite used a function - theoretical approach to obtain a mapping formula in terms of the schottky - klein prime function associated with the circular domain .",
    "( the equivalence of the two methods was established in @xcite . )",
    "it is important to point out that both these formulations entail an implicit choice of a multiply connected rectilinear slit domain in an auxiliary preimage plane , whereby each rectilinear boundary segment of this preimage domain is mapped to a polygonal boundary ( see below ) .",
    "the introduction of a preimage domain with rectilinear boundaries makes it possible to write down an explicit expression for the derivative of the desired conformal mapping , which can then be integrated to yield a generalised schwarz - christoffel formula .",
    "it is thus clear that different choices of rectilinear slit domains in the auxiliary plane will result in different formulae for the generalised schwarz - christoffel mapping .",
    "therefore , a derivation of alternative representation formulae is of some interest .    in this paper",
    "a general formalism to construct conformal mappings of multiply connected polygonal domains is presented .",
    "the method applies to both bounded and unbounded polygonal domains but emphasis will be given to the bounded case as formulated in  [ sec:2 ] .",
    "a key ingredient in the approach described herein is the introduction of a multiply connected rectilinear slit domain in an auxiliary @xmath0-plane , such that each rectilinear boundary in the @xmath0-plane is mapped to a polygonal boundary in the @xmath1-plane .",
    "it is advantageous to have rectilinear boundaries in the preimage domain because the derivative of the respective conformal mapping has constant argument on each of domain s boundaries . to derive an expression for the mapping derivative , it is expedient to introduce a slit map from a bounded multiply connected circular domain in an auxiliary @xmath2-plane to the rectilinear slit domain in the @xmath0-plane . using the properties of the schottky - klein prime function associated with the circular domain , as summarized in  [ sec:3 ] and  [ sec:4 ]",
    ", it is then possible to obtain an explicit expression for the derivative of the mapping from the circular domain to the polygonal region .",
    "the desired conformal mapping is then written in final form as an indefinite integral whose integrand consists of i ) a product of powers of the schottky - klein prime functions and ii ) a prefactor function , @xmath3 , that depends on the choice of the rectilinear slit domain in the @xmath0-plane .    a detailed derivation of the prefactor @xmath3 is given in  [ sec:5 ] for the case where the rectilinear slit domain consists of the upper half - plane cut along radial segments .",
    "this preimage domain turns out to be the most convenient one not only in that it naturally extends to multiply connected domains the usual treatment of simply connected polygonal regions but most importantly because it yields a simpler formula for the generalized schwarz - christoffel mapping . as further illustration of the method presented here ,",
    "the corresponding formulae for two other canonical slit domains ( including the case considered by crowdy @xcite ) are derived in  [ sec:6 ] .",
    "these alternative representations have , however , the inconvenience of containing certain arbitrary parameters in the interior of the circular domain . for completeness , the case of unbounded polygonal domains is briefly discussed in  [ sec:7 ] , after which our main results and conclusions are summarized in  [ sec:8 ] .",

    "this property was first noticed by crowdy @xcite , who obtained a conformal mapping from @xmath32 to an unbounded polygonal region by implicitly considering an auxiliary rectilinear slit domain consisting of a semi - infinite strip with vertical slits .",
    "as shown above , relation ( [ eq : sinf ] ) holds irrespective of the choice of the rectilinear slit domain used to construct the corresponding mapping formulas for bounded and unbounded multiply connected polygonal domains .",
    "a general framework has been presented for constructing conformal mappings from a bounded circular domain @xmath32 to a multiply connected polygonal region @xmath4 ( either bounded or unbounded ) .",
    "a key ingredient in our scheme is the introduction of a conformal mapping from @xmath32 to a rectilinear slit domain @xmath18 in a subsidiary @xmath0-plane .",
    "this allows us to write an explicit formula for the derivative @xmath47 , and hence for @xmath48 , in terms of the schottky - klein prime function associated with the domain @xmath32 . after integration , the desired conformal mapping @xmath49",
    "is then obtained as an indefinite integral whose integrand consists of a product of powers of the schottky - klein prime functions and a prefactor function @xmath3 that depends on the choice of the rectilinear slit domain @xmath18 .",
    "an explicit formula for @xmath3 was derived by first considering the case where the rectilinear slit domain @xmath18 consists of the upper half - plane with radial slits .",
    "the generality of our approach was subsequently demonstrated by obtaining alternative formulae for the prefactor function @xmath3 pertaining to other canonical slit domains . for a given polygonal domain @xmath4 , these various formulas ( once their associated parameters have been determined ) provide different representations of the same conformal mapping @xmath49 .",
    "it is to be noted , however , that the formula for @xmath3 obtained by considering the upper half - plane with radial slits is arguably the simplest one , in the sense that the only unknown parameters are the zeros of the slit map @xmath31 , which can be numerically computed once the domain @xmath32 is specified .",
    "by contrast , the corresponding formulae for @xmath3 obtained for other canonical slit domains have , in addition , one or more arbitrary parameters inside the domain @xmath32 . although the function @xmath3 does not ultimately depend on the values of these parameters ( except for an overall factor independent of @xmath2 ; see crowdy @xcite ) , the existence of arbitrary parameters inside @xmath32 may present an additional ( and unnecessary ) source of complication .",
    "this is particularly true in the case that a given target polygonal domain @xmath4 is specified , for here the conformal moduli of the domain @xmath32 are not known _ a priori _ and hence the arbitrary parameters can not be fixed beforehand .    in light of the foregoing discussion",
    ", it can be argued that the mapping formula derived in  [ sec:5 ] using the upper half - plane with radial slits should be viewed as the natural extension to multiply connected polygonal domains of the standard schwarz - christoffel mapping from the upper half - plane to a simply connected polygonal region .",
    "it should also be preferable in applications because of its simplicity . in this context",
    ", it is worth noting that this mapping formula was recently employed by green & vasconcelos @xcite to construct exact solutions for multiple bubbles steadily moving in a hele - shaw channel .",
    "it is thus hoped that other problems involving multiply connected polygonal domains may be conveniently tackled with the formalism presented here .",
