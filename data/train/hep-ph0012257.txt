    "details will be presented elsewhere .    in figs.[dsigma_20 ] and [ dsigma_200 ] we show the differential cross sections for elastic scattering using @xmath126 where , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the helicities of the incoming and outgoing photons , respectively .",

    "as we stated earlier we do not , in general , expect our results be reliable near the forward ( @xmath61 ) and backward ( @xmath59 ) directions on a scale @xmath131 . in our calculations , we have , for instance , replaced factors such as @xmath132 with @xmath133 .",
    "this situation is similar to that encountered when calculating the amplitudes for quark+gluon @xmath134 quark+photon @xcite , where the existence of the kinematic zeros proportional to @xmath19 in the forward direction is obscured by the assumption that the quarks are massless .",
    "the total cross sections , for helicities @xmath46 and @xmath47 , are given by @xmath135 ) , where the helicity flip amplitudes vanish @xcite . in fig.[sigma_avg ] , we show the total cross section for an unpolarized initial photon , @xmath136 this figure illustrates the roughly @xmath137 behavior of the total cross section to near the threshold for the @xmath3-boson production .",
    "a fit to the points in fig.[sigma_avg ] , for @xmath138 , yields @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the energy of a photon ( or a neutrino ) . in the ref.@xcite , it is shown that the cross section for the process @xmath5 , in the range of energies @xmath141 , can be written as @xmath142 comparison of the eq.([siggngn ] ) with the eq.([siggnggn ] ) , shows that the two cross sections are equal for @xmath143 or @xmath144 gev .",
    "therefore , at sufficiently high energies , the process @xmath0 dominates the process @xmath5 .",
    "as shown above , the cross section for elastic scattering is larger than the cross section for the inelastic scattering when @xmath145 gev .",
    "since the weak interaction violates parity , the final photons in both processes acquire circular polarization . in the case of inelastic scattering",

    ", we have plotted the polarization p as a function of the center of mass energy @xmath151 .",
    "as is clear from this graph , for wide range of energies above @xmath133 gev , the polarization is of order @xmath146% , while for energies around @xmath152 gev it can reach over @xmath153% . to find p for center of mass energies @xmath154 , we can use the helicity amplitudes in eq.(4 ) of ref.@xcite , to obtain @xmath155 .",
    "the angular dependence of the the final photon s polarization can be obtained from @xmath156 defined as @xmath157 or , since @xmath158 , @xmath159 the polarization @xmath156 is plotted in fig.[polarization_angle ] as a function of @xmath160 . in this figure ,",
    "the solid line is effectively unchanged for the range of center of mass energies @xmath161 .",
    "the dashed curve shows that the forward amplitudes @xmath162 and @xmath163 are not equal above the threshold for @xmath3 production .",
    "this is consistent with the dispersion relation eq.([disp ] ) .",
    "also included in this figure is the polarization for the case @xmath154 , which is based on the eq.(5 ) of the ref.@xcite ( @xmath164 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that both the @xmath137 behavior of the elastic cross section and the angular dependence of @xmath165 obtained in the low energy limit @xcite persist to energies of order @xmath11 .",
    "this means that a low energy effective interaction of the form @xcite @xmath166 where @xmath167 and @xmath168 are the symmetrical energy - momentum tensors of the neutrino and the photon , gives an accurate description of elastic scattering to quite high energies .    finally , to investigate the importance of the reaction @xmath0 in cosmology",
