    "the characterization of interference allows to analyze cellular networks performance . in cellular networks ,",
    "an important parameter for this characterization is the sinr ( signal to interference plus noise ratio ) at any point of the cell .",
    "indeed , it allows the derivation of performance evaluation ( outage probabilities , capacity , ... ) .",
    "we focus on downlink throughout this paper , since that direction is often the limited link in term of capacity .",
    "nevertheless , our approach can easily be extended to the uplink .",
    "the issue of expressing outage probability in cellular networks has been extensively addressed in the literature . for this study",
    ", there are two possible assumptions : ( 1 ) considering only the shadowing effect , ( 2 ) considering both shadowing and fast fading effects . in the former case , authors mainly face the problem of expressing the distribution of the sum of log - normally random variables ; several classical methods can be applied to solve this issue ( see e.g. @xcite @xcite ) . in the latter case , formulas usually consist in many infinite integrals , which are uneasy to handle in a practical way ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in both cases ,",
    "outage probability is always an explicit function of all distances from the user to interferers .",
    "as the need for easy - to - use formulas for outage probability is clear , approximations need to be done . working on the uplink , @xcite derived the distribution function of a ratio of path - losses with shadowing , which is essential for the evaluation of external interference .",
    "for that , authors approximate the hexagonal cell with a disk of same area",
    ". authors of @xcite assume perfect power control on the uplink , while neglecting fast fading . on the downlink , chan and hanly @xcite precisely approximate the distribution of the other - cell interference .",
    "they however provide formulas that are difficult to handle in practice and do not consider fast fading .",
    "immovilli and merani @xcite take into account both channel effects and make several assumptions in order to obtain simplified formulas .",
    "in particular , they approximate interference by its mean value .",
    "outage probability is however an explicit function of all distances from receiver to every interferer .",
    "zorzi @xcite , proposes a formula available but for packet radio networks rather than for cellular systems .",
    "authors of @xcite provide some interesting characterizations and upper bounds of the outage probability but neglects the slowly varying pathgains .",
    "in @xcite , authors consider both shadowing and fast fading but assume a single interferer .    in this paper ,",
    "to calculate the sinr distribution of a mobile located at any distance from its serving base station ( bs ) , we consider the useful power he received and the interferences coming from all the bs stations of the network .",
    "we jointly take into account pathloss , shadowing and fast fading and derive a simple and easily computable outage probability formula .",
    "we validate that formula by comparisons of the figures obtained with it to the ones obtained by monte carlo simulations . at last , we rely on a recently proposed fluid model @xcite @xcite in order to express the outage probability as a simple analytical expression depending on the distance to the serving bs .",
    "such an expression allows further integrations much more easily than with existing formulas .",
    "the formula can be used to analyze the coverage of a bs .    in the next section ,",
    "we derive outage probabilities , while considering first only pathloss and shadowing and then pathloss , shadowing and fast fading jointly .",

    "the numerator of this factor is a sum of log - normally distributed rv , which can be approximated by a log - normally distributed rv @xcite .",

[ cdf ] characterizes the cumulative density function ( cdf ) of @xmath34 .",
    "that formula also allows to analyze the coverage of a bs for a given outage probability .",

    "figures [ cdfsinreta3 ] , [ cdfsinreta4 ] [ cdfsinreta3r05 ] and [ cdfsinreta4r1 ] show the specific impact of shadowing alone ( figure [ cdfsinreta4r1 ] ) and both shadowing and fast fading ( figures [ cdfsinreta3 ] , [ cdfsinreta4 ] , [ cdfsinreta3r05 ] ) on the outage probability .",
    "in particular the curve @xmath83  db ( figure [ cdfsinreta4r1 ] ) shows that , without shadowing and fast fading , the sinr received at the edge of the cell reaches -4db . since there is no random variations of the propagation ,",
    "this value is deterministic : the outage is 0% until a sinr of -4db and 100% for higher values of sinr .",
    "when the shadowing is taken into account ( but not the fast fading ) , we observe for @xmath84 , a sinr of -8 db for an outage probability of 10% . and",
    "when the shadowing and the fast fading are both taken into account ( figure [ cdfsinreta3 ] ) , we observe for @xmath84 , a sinr of -16 db for an outage probability of 10% .    with these results ,",
    "an operator would be able to analyze the outage , and to admit or reject new connections according to each specific environment of the entering ms .",
    "indeed , the sinr depends on the mobile location and on the environment ( eq .  [ mf ] ) , i.e. the shadowing , the exponential pathloss parameter @xmath62 ( which depends on different characteristics and particularly the cell dimensions and the type of environment e.g. urban or country ) , the number and positions of the base stations .",
    "hereafter we present some other examples of possible applications of the analytical approach we proposed .",
    "the coverage of a bs can be defined as the area where the sinr received by a mobile reaches a given value with a given outage probability .",
    "figure 4 shows , for @xmath75= 4 , that at the edge of the cell ( r= @xmath85 ) , the sinr reaches the value of -15 db with a probability of 10% , when @xmath84 . with the same outage probability ( 10% ) , the sinr only reaches -20 db when @xmath86 .",
    "since the capacity and the throughput @xmath87 can be expressed as a function of the sinr , for example using the shannon expression @xmath88 , the analytical method we developed can be used to analyze this performance indicator instantaneously .",
    "in this paper , we establish a simple formula of the outage probability in cellular networks , while considering pathloss , shadowing and fast fading . taking into account pathloss and shadowing , we first express the inverse of the sinr of a mobile located at a given distance of its serving bs as a lognormal random variable .",
    "we give close form formulas of its mean @xmath25 and standard deviation @xmath26 based on the analytical fluid model .",
    "it allows us to analytically express the outage probability at a given distance of the serving bs .",
    "we then consider both pathloss , shadowing and fast fading and give an analytical expression of the outage probability at a given distance of the serving bs .",
    "the fluid model allows us to obtain formulas that only depend on the distance to the serving bs .",
    "the analytical model that we propose is validated by comparisons with monte carlo simulations .",
    "the formulas derived in this paper allow to obtain performances results instantaneously .",
    "the proposed framework is a powerful tool to study performances of cellular networks and to design fine algorithms taking into account the distance to the serving bs , shadowing and fast fading .",
    "it can particularly easily be used to study frequency reuse schemes in ofdma systems .",
    "each bs transmits a power @xmath89 so the power received by a mobile is characterized by a lognormal distribution @xmath48 as @xmath90 and we can write @xmath91 ( to simplify the calculation we consider k=1 ) .",
    "so the total power received by a mobile is a lognormal rv x characterized by its mean and variance @xmath92 and we can write : @xmath93 so we have since @xmath89 whatever the base station j , considering identical @xmath94 : @xmath95 we can express the mean interference power @xmath96 received by a mobile as : @xmath97 the variance @xmath98 of the sum of interferences is written as @xmath99    introducing @xmath100    the mean value of the total interference received by a mobile is given by @xmath101 and @xmath102",
