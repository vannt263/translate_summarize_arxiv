    "many processes in biological systems as well as in the chemical and petroleum industry involve the transport and filtration of particles in porous media with which they interact through various forces@xcite .",
    "these interactions often result in particle adsorption and/or entrapment by the medium .",
    "examples include filtration in the respiratory system , groundwater transport , in situ bioremediation , passage of white blood cells in brain blood vessels in the presence of jam-1 proteins , passage of viral particles in granular media , separation of species in chromatography , and gel permeation .",
    "the particle - medium interactions in these systems are not always optimal for particle retention .",
    "for example , the passage of groundwater through soil often happens under chemically unfavorable conditions , and as a result many captured particles ( e.g. , viruses and bacteria ) may be released back to the solution . while filtration under favorable conditions has been studied and modeled extensively , we are just beginning to understand the process occurring under unfavorable conditions .",
    "several models have been developed to describe the kinetics of particle filtration under unfavorable conditions .",

    "( [ eq : convection - diffusion ] ) to the breakthrough curves .    despite their attractive simplicity",
    ", it is widely accepted now that the phenomenological models at the mean - field level have significant problems .",
    "first , the depth dependent deposition curves for viruses and bacteria are often much steeper than it would be expected if the deposition rates were uniform throughout the substrate .",
    "this was commonly compensated by introducing the depth - dependent deposition rates .",
    "the problem was brought to light in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was demonstrated that the steeper - than - expected deposition rates under unfavorable filtering conditions also exist for inert colloids .",
    "second , bradford et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the usual mean - field models based on the cde , accounting for dynamic dispersivity and attachment and detachment phenomena , can not explain the shape of both the breakthrough curves and the subsequent filter flushing . in these experiments some particles were retained in the medium , and the authors argued for the need to include the straining ( permanent capture of colloids ) in the model .",
    "even so , these models may still be insufficient to fit the experiments @xcite .",
    "more elaborate models to describe deep - bed filtration have been proposed in refs .",
    "these models go beyond the mean - field description by simulating subsequent filter layers as a collection of multiply connected pipes with a wide distribution of radii , which results in a variation in flow speed and also of the attachment and detachment rates ( even straining in some cases ) .",
    "the disadvantage of these models is that they are essentially computer based : it is difficult to gain an understanding of the qualitative properties of the solutions , without extensive simulations .",
    "furthermore , the simulation results suffer from statistical uncertainties .    in the present work ,",
    "we develop a minimalist mean - field model to investigate filtering under unfavorable conditions .",
    "the model accounts for both a convective flow and the primary attachment and detachment processes .",
    "unlike the previous mean - field models of filtration , our model contains attachment sites ( traps ) with different detachment rates @xmath3 [ see eq .",

    ", the model admits exact analytical solutions for the profiles of the deposition and breakthrough curves which permit us to understand qualitatively the effect of the corresponding parameters and design a protocol for extracting them from experiment .",
    "one of the advantages of our model is that the `` shallow '' short - lived traps represent the same effect as hydrodynamical dispersivity without generating unphysically fast moving particles or requiring an additional boundary condition at the inlet of the filter .",
    "the `` deep '' long - lived traps allow to correctly simulate long - time asymptotics of the released colloids in the effluent during a washout stage .",
    "the traps with intermediate detachment rates determine the most prominent features of breakthrough curves .",
    "the effect of every trap kind is to decrease the apparent drift velocity .",
    "as attachment and detachment rate constants depend on colloid size , we can also account for the apparent acceleration of larger particles without any microscopic description as in ref .",

    "this is sometimes followed by a filter washout stage in which clean water is pumped through the filter .",
    "the filtration processes are characterized by two relevant experimental quantities : the particle breakthrough and deposition profile curves . while breakthrough curve represents the concentration of effluent particles at the outlet of the column as a function of time",
    ", deposition curves illustrate the depth distribution of concentration of the particles retained throughout the column .",
    "as the suspended particles move through the filtering column , each individual colloid follows its own trajectory . consequently , even for small particles that are never trapped in the filter , the passage time through the column fluctuates . in the case of laminar flows with small reynolds numbers and sufficiently small particles , which presumably follow the local velocity lines , the passage time scales inversely with the average flow velocity along the column @xmath0 .",
    "the effects of the variation between the trajectories of particles as well as their speeds can be approximated by the velocity - dependent diffusion coefficient @xmath5 , where @xmath1 is the _ hydrodynamic dispersivity _ of the filtering medium . in comparison ,",
    "the actual diffusion rate of colloids in experiments is negligibly small .",
    "dispersivity is often obtained through tracer experiments in which the motion of the particles , i.e. , salt ions , which move passively through the filter medium without being trapped , is traced as a function of time .",

    "while in many instances this may not be crucial , the application of the model to , e.g. , public health and water safety issues might trigger a false alert .    _",

    "( [ eq : convection - diffusion ] ) contains second spatial derivative , which requires in addition to the knowledge of @xmath9 at the inlet , @xmath12 , another type of boundary condition to describe the concentration of particles along the column .",

    "the situation has an analogy in neutron physics@xcite . while neutrons propagate diffusively within a medium , they move ballistically in vacuum",
    ". a correct calculation of the neutron flux requires a detailed simulation of the momentum distribution function within a few mean - free paths from the surface separating vacuum and the medium .",
    "in contrast to the filtration theory , for the case of neutron scattering , where the neutron distribution is stationary it is common to use an approximate boundary condition in terms of a `` linear extrapolation distance '' ( the inverse logarithmic derivative of neutron density ) .    the cde [ see eq .",
