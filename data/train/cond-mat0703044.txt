    "the realization of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in low - density atomic vapors @xcite has led to an explosion of experimental and theoretical research on the physics of quantum - degenerate atomic and molecular systems . while much of the work so far has concentrated on systems characterized by @xmath1-wave two - body interactions , the recent demonstration of a condensate of chromium atoms @xcite opens up the study of gases that interact via long - range , anisotropic magnetic dipole interactions . in a parallel development",
    ", it can be expected that quantum degenerate samples of heteronuclear polar molecules will soon be available through the use of feshbach resonances @xcite , photoassociation @xcite , or a combination of the two .",
    "when in their vibrational ground state , these molecules interact primarily via the electric dipole potential , and they are expected to provide a fascinating new type dipole - dominated condensates in the near future .    as a result of the anisotropy and long - range nature of the dipole - dipole interaction , a number of novel phenomena",
    "have been predicted to occur in low - density quantum - degenerate dipolar atomic and molecular systems , both in conventional traps and in optical lattices .",
    "an early study of the ground state of polar condensates was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , which determined its stability diagram as a function of the number of atoms and @xmath1-wave scattering length .",
    "it identified a stable structured ground state for a specific range of parameters . at about the same time , the effect of trap geometry on the stability of the condensate was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite for a system dominated by the dipole interaction .",
    "this was followed by the prediction @xcite of the existence of a number of quantum phases for dipolar bosons in optical lattices .",
    "recent work @xcite considers the structural phases of vortex lattices in rotating dipolar bose gases .    a novel feature of dipolar condensates , as compared to their scalar cousins , is the appearance of a roton minimum in their bogoliubov spectrum .",
    "this feature was discussed in the context of atomic condensates in ref .",
    "@xcite , which considered the impact of the roton - maxon feature in the excitation spectrum and the stability of pancake - shaped dipolar condensates . for this particular geometry",
    "it was found that the excitation spectrum can touch the zero - energy axis for a non - zero wave vector @xcite , which points to the instability of homogeneous condensates and the onset of density modulations @xcite . a roton minimum",
    "was also found @xcite for the case of laser - induced dipolar interactions in self - bound becs with cylindrical symmetry .",
    "quasi-2d dipolar bosons with a density - modulated order parameter were determined to be unstable within the mean - field theory @xcite , and cigar - shaped quasi - one dimensional condensates were likewise found @xcite to be dynamically unstable for dipoles polarized along the axis of the cylindrical trap .",
    "the stability of dipolar condensates in pancake traps was also recently discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which found the appearance of biconcave condensates for certain values of the trap aspect ratio and strength of the dipole interaction . from the bogoliubov excitation spectrum it was possible to attribute the instability of the condensate under a broad range of conditions to its azimuthal component .",
    "further building on these studies , the present note reports the results of a detailed numerical analysis of the stability and structure of the hartree ground state of dipolar condensates confined in anisotropic harmonic trap .",
    "we proceed by introducing the trap frequencies @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , in the @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 directions , and the corresponding trap aspect ratios @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "thus @xmath9 corresponds to a pancake trap , whereas @xmath10 corresponds to a cylindrical trap with free motion in @xmath6 direction .",
    "we further assume for concreteness that an external field polarizes the dipoles along the @xmath5 axis .",
    "the stability of the condensate is then determined as a function of the trap aspect ratios and of an effective dipolar interaction strength that is proportional to the number of atoms or molecules in the condensate .",
    "various ground state structures of the condensate are identified in the stable region of parameter space .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : section ii introduces our model and comments on important aspects of our numerical approach .",
    "section iii summarizes our results , identifying up to five different types of possible ground states , depending on the tightness of the trap and the particle number .",
    "finally , section iv is a summary and conclusion .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction between two particles separated by a distance @xmath11 is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the dipole - dipole interaction strength and @xmath14 is the polarization direction . for atoms with a permanent magnetic dipole moment we have",
    "@xmath15 while for dipolar molecules @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 being the magnetic moment of the atoms and the electric dipole moment of the molecules , respectively .    within the mean - field approximation , the condensate order parameter @xmath19 satisfies the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xmath20 \\phi(r ) ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the sum of the kinetic energy and the trapping potential and @xmath22 denotes the number of particles in the condensate .",
    "the second term on the right - hand side of eq . ( [ gpeq ] ) is the contact interaction , @xmath23 being proportional to the @xmath1-wave scattering strength @xmath24 , and the third term describes the effects of the nonlocal dipole - dipole interaction . for dipole interaction dominated systems , @xmath25 is small compared to @xmath26 .",
    "this is the case that we consider here , and in the following we neglect the @xmath1-wave scattering term altogether .    for convenience",
    "we introduce the dimensionless parameter @xmath27 that measures the effective strength of the dipole - dipole interaction , where the oscillator length @xmath28 .",
    "the condensate ground state is then determined numerically by solving the gross - pitaevskii equation ( [ gpeq ] ) for imaginary times .",
    "the term involving the dipole interaction energy is calculated using the convolution theorem , @xmath29 * { \\cal f } \\left      [ | \\phi(r ) |^2 \\right ] \\right \\ } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 and @xmath31 stand for fourier transform and inverse fourier transform , respectively . the dipole - dipole interaction is calculated analytically in momentum space as @xcite , @xmath32= \\frac{4\\pi}{3 } \\left [ 3 \\frac{k^2_y}{k^2_x+k^2_y+k^2_z } - 1 \\right ] , \\ ] ] @xmath33 are the momentum components in @xmath34 direction .",
    "the initial order parameter was chosen randomly , and the stability diagram was generated for each pair of parameters @xmath35 by increasing the effective dipolar strength @xmath36 until a critical value @xmath37 above which the condensate collapses . because of the random initial condition this value varies slightly from run to run .",
    "the plotted results show the average over 100 realizations of the initial wave function , the error bars indicating the maximum deviation from of @xmath37 from its mean @xmath38 .",
    "this approach typically resulted in numerical uncertainties similar to those of ref .",
    "a good starting point for the discussion of our results is the observation that in the case of a cylindrical trap , @xmath10 , we found no stable structured condensate ground state .",
    "( by structured profiles , we mean profiles that are not simple gaussians . )",
    "in particular , solutions exhibiting density modulations along the @xmath6-axis were found to be unstable . moving then to the case of a pancake trap by keeping @xmath39 fixed but increasing @xmath40 from @xmath41 to @xmath42 , we found for @xmath43 the appearance of a small parameter region where the stable ground state is characterized by a structured density profile , the domain of stability of this structured solution increasing with @xmath39 . a @xmath44 phase space stability diagram typical of this regime is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] for @xmath45 . in this figure , region",
    "@xmath46 is characterized by the existence of a usual condensate with its familiar , structureless gaussian - like density profile .",
    "as @xmath40 is increased , the condensate becomes unstable for decreasing values of the effective dipole interaction strength @xmath36 , or alternatively of the particle number @xmath22 .",
    "for @xmath47 , though , the ground state changes from a gaussian - shaped to a double - peaked density profile ( domain ii in the figure ) , before the system becomes unstable .    figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] show surface plots and corresponding 3-d renditions of density profiles typical of the various situations encountered in our study .",
    "figures [ fig4]a and [ fig5]a are illustrative of the present case . the appearance of two density peaks away from the center of the trap results from the interplay between the repulsive nature of the dipoles in a plane transverse to its polarization direction , the @xmath48 plane , and the confining potential .    increasing the tightness of the trap along the polarization direction @xmath5 , i.e , increasing @xmath39 , results in the emergence of additional types of structured ground states .",
    "one such case is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , which is for @xmath49 . for small values of @xmath40 ,",
    "i.e. , a weak trapping potential along the @xmath6-direction , we observe the appearance of a domain ( region iii in the figure ) characterized by a double - peaked ground state with the maximum density along the @xmath6 direction and a gaussian - like density in @xmath4 direction .",
    "this type of double - peaked structure along the weak trapping axis was first predicted in ref .",
    "typical density profiles in this region resemble those in figs . 4a and 5a , but with a rotation by 90 degrees in the @xmath50-plane . the regions ii and iii are separated by a small additional domain iv characterized by a ground - state distribution with a quadruple - peaked structure as illustrated in figs . 4b and 5b , as might be expected .",
    "in general , these characteristics of the ground state density profile persist until @xmath51 .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows a stability diagram typical of higher values of the aspect ratio @xmath39 , in this case @xmath52 , for @xmath53 .",
    "as @xmath36 is increased , the ground - state density of the condensate first undergoes a transition from a gaussian - like to a double - peaked profile of the type illustrated in figs . 4b and 5b ( region iii ) .",
    "as @xmath36 is further increased , this domain is followed for @xmath40 close enough to unity by a second transition to a domain ( region v ) with the appearance of a density minimum near trap center .",
    "initially , this minimum is surrounded by a region with a radial density modulation , see fig . 4c , but for larger values of @xmath40 this modulation is reduced , see figs .",
    "4d and 5d . in that region",
    ", the density profile resembles the solution previously reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for a similar parameter range .    .",
    "in the case of atoms a typical magnetic moment of @xmath54 , and we find that the range of critical dipole strengths @xmath36 corresponding to structured ground states can be achieved for @xmath55 atoms for trapping frequencies @xmath56 . for molecules with a typical electric dipole moment of @xmath57",
    "the corresponding number is @xmath58 molecules .",
    "while these are relatively high particle numbers , especially for the atomic case , they do not seem out of reach of experimental realization .",
    "in conclusion , we have performed a detailed numerical study of the ground state structure and stability of ultracold dipolar bosons in an anisotropic trap for dipoles polarized along the @xmath5-direction .",
    "the trap aspect ratios along @xmath5 and @xmath6 direction , @xmath39 and @xmath40 were used as control parameters , and the mean - field stability diagram has established as function of these parameters and a dimensionless interaction strength @xmath36 . for small @xmath39 the system was found to exhibit a standard density profile , but for larger values , and depending on @xmath40 , various structured ground state were found to appear before reaching the unstable regime where the condensate collapses .",
    "these include a four - peak structured solution in the @xmath59 plane , a ring - like ground state with a modulated radial density profile . for @xmath60 and @xmath61",
    ", we found a biconcave condensate profile , as already reported in @xcite .    for strong confining potentials along the dipole polarization direction ,",
    "i.e for large @xmath39 , increasing @xmath40 can be viewed as resulting in a change from a quasi - one dimensional to a quasi - two - dimensional geometry . as such we can think of the various ground - state structures as a result of dimensional crossover in a trapping geometry . to gain a deeper understanding of these structures",
    "as we approach the instability region , future work study the bogoliubov spectrum of the trapped system .",
