    "1(b ) ] , a measurement is performed by lowering the barrier between the qubit `` left '' potential well and a much deeper `` right '' well , so that tunneling from qubit state @xmath0 ( the first excited left - well state ) to the right well occurs with probability close to one , while state @xmath1 ( the left - well ground state ) remains intact .",

    "we will assume that before the measurement pulse the right well of the qubit potential [ see fig .",
    "1(b ) ] is much deeper than the left well ( as in refs .  )",
    ". the qubit levels @xmath1 and @xmath0 are , respectively , the ground and the first excited levels in the left well .",
    "the depth @xmath16 of a left ( @xmath17 ) or right ( @xmath18 ) well ( i.e.  the energy difference between the potential maximum and minimum ) depends on external flux @xmath19 and can be characterized by the estimated number of the discrete levels in the well : n_l , r= , where @xmath20 is the classical oscillation frequency near the well bottom ( the `` plasma frequency '' ) , @xmath21 ( here @xmath22 corresponds to the well bottom ) .",
    "the energy dissipation in the phase qubit can be described by introducing resistance @xmath23 into the circuit [ fig .",
    "[ schematic](a ) ] ; however , for the most of this paper the dissipation is neglected ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the fast qubit state measurement@xcite is achieved by applying a pulse of the magnetic flux @xmath19 , which lowers sufficiently slowly ( adiabatically ) the barrier height @xmath25 ( and so @xmath26 ) , until the first excited state @xmath0 of the qubit left well becomes very close to the barrier top , so that the system in this state can easily tunnel through the barrier to the right well , while tunneling from the ground state @xmath1 is almost negligible .",
    "( in principle , the measurement can be arranged in a way so that the state @xmath0 goes over the barrier ; however , in this case tunneling from the state @xmath1 becomes significant . ) after the measurement pulse the potential @xmath2 is returned to its initial shape by decreasing @xmath19 back to its value before the measurement .",
    "ideally , the system initially in the upper qubit state @xmath0 should switch after the measurement to the right well , while the qubit initially in the ground state @xmath1 should remain in the left well .",
    "however , at least two kinds of errors are possible in this process of qubit measurement .",
    "first , finite duration of the measurement pulse ( which is supposed to be rather fast ) and corresponding nonadiabatic effects during increase of the flux @xmath27 , may lead to transitions between levels @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( and other levels ) before the tunneling starts .",
    "second , during the tunneling stage the qubit in the state @xmath0 may erroneously remain in the left well and/or state @xmath1 may erroneously switch to the right well .",
    "one reason for the second type of error is finite ratio of tunneling rates for the states @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( ideally , it should be infinitely large ) .",
    "another reason is the incomplete switching of the state @xmath0 due to repopulation of the left well from the right well during or _",
    "after _ the tunneling stage .",
    "these kinds of errors will be considered in the following sections .    to solve numerically the time - dependent schrdinger equation",
    ", we use the multi - projection approach of ref .  .",
    "in more detail , we divide the pulse duration @xmath28 into small time increments @xmath29 and at each moment @xmath30 we find the eigenvalues @xmath31 and eigenfunctions @xmath32 for the hamiltonian @xmath33 , using the fourier grid hamiltonian method @xcite ( equivalently , the periodic pseudospectral @xcite method ) .",

    "( notice that excitation of state @xmath0 to higher levels does not lead to the measurement error . ) however , since increase of @xmath19 is not infinitely slow , there may be nonadiabatic transitions between levels @xmath1 and @xmath0 ( and/or higher levels ) leading to measurement errors .",

    "the third term is maximized when both qubit states are equally occupied , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is a real number .",

    "therefore , if only one qubit state is initially occupied , the error ( in the lowest order ) is p_e = p_01()=q_e^2 , which is much smaller than @xmath80 .",

    "this condition is actually a lower bound ; the required pulse duration @xmath266 can be even longer because of not immediate population of the level @xmath267 , widening of the range of populated levels in the course of relaxation ( `` energy diffusion '' ) , and possibility of repopulation due to tunneling . for the case shown in figs .",

    "it also makes harder the solution of the cross - talk problem@xcite for simultaneous measurement of several qubits , which argues in favor of designing adjustable coupling between qubits .",
    "in this paper we have studied the behavior of a flux - biased phase qubit in the process of its measurement ( using analytical approaches and numerical solution of the schrdinger equation ) and analyzed several mechanisms leading to measurement errors .",

    "the ratio of wkb tunneling rates @xmath177 for states @xmath0 and @xmath1 is few times @xmath199 and decreases with the applied flux bias ( i.e.  when faster measurement is required ) .",

    "the measurement error can be caused by the repopulation of the left well of the qubit potential [ fig.[schematic](b ) ] after the tunneling stage of the measurement process .",
    "a simple estimate ( [ 1 ] ) for the repopulation effect shows that reliable measurement requires relatively long measurement pulses ; in the analyzed example the pulse should be longer than @xmath277",
    ". this result may be quite important for the design of the quantum gates based on phase qubits .",
