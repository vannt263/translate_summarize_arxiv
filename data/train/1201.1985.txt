    "the reduction of the laser linewidth has always been an essential and critical issue in atomic , molecular , and optical physics since the first realization of lasers in 1960 . in laser - cooling experiments , for example",
    ", the laser linewidth should be narrower than the natural width of the cooling transition of atoms ( ranging from khz to mhz ) for doppler cooling to work @xcite .",
    "the importance of narrow - linewidth lasers is more prominent in the field of optical atomic clocks , where an extremely narrow ( @xmath0mhz ) optical transition of atoms @xcite or single ions @xcite is probed by a laser with a sub - hertz linewidth @xcite .",
    "the pound - drever - hall ( pdh ) method , invented in the early 1980s @xcite , has become the standard method for laser linewidth reduction .",
    "the key feature of the pdh method is its use of the cavity not only as a frequency reference but also as a _ time - averaged phase memory _ of the incident laser field , which leads to a fast response to the laser phase fluctuations on a time scale shorter than the cavity response time , enabling efficient laser linewidth reduction @xcite .",
    "we note that the hnsch - couillaud laser stabilization scheme @xcite , in which the change of the reflected light polarization is monitored , also benefits the phase - storing property of the cavity .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an alternative method of laser phase and frequency stabilization , in which _ atomic coherence _",
    "( dipole oscillations of atoms ) is used as a phase memory of the laser field transmitting through an atomic vapor .",
    "this method has an apparent advantage of its immunity to mechanical noise from environment .",
    "moreover , unlike cavities made of glass with heat expansion , the resonance frequency of atoms , to which the laser is locked , is independent of the temperature of the atomic vapor in a doppler - free configuration .",
    "these features would drastically simplify the experiments which have relied on the pdh method using an ultralow heat expansion ( ule ) cavity for laser linewidth reduction @xcite .",
    "we preformed a preliminary experiment using a distributed feedback ( dfb ) laser diode and a rubidium vapor cell , and observed a significant linewidth reduction ( from 2 mhz to 20 khz ) , proving the effectiveness of the method .",
    "to show the analogy between the pdh method and the proposed method , let us first review the principle of pdh phase and frequency stabilization in detail . suppose a laser beam with frequency @xmath1 is incident to a cavity with resonance frequency @xmath2 and resonance width ( fwhm ) @xmath3 as in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "we write the complex amplitude of the incident field , measured at a point just outside the cavity , as @xmath4 .",
    "the reflected field @xmath5 is the sum of the promptly reflected field @xmath6 off the input mirror and the leakage field @xmath7 from the cavity . in the case of a high finesse cavity , @xmath8 ( we assume there is no phase change upon reflection for simplicity ) and the steady - state complex amplitude of the reflected field",
    "is then expressed as @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the intensity reflectivity of the input mirror , @xmath11 is the amplitude ratio between successive roundtrips in the cavity , and @xmath12 is a normalized laser frequency detuning from the cavity resonance . in the following , we assume @xmath13 ( undercoupled cavity ) where the reflected light remains even at the center of the resonance as depicted in fig . [ fig1](b ) .",
    "figure [ fig1](c ) shows the relation between @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 in the rotating complex plane where @xmath14 always lies on the positive side of the real axis .",
    "the reflected field @xmath15 , given by eq .",
    "( [ reflectance ] ) , traces out a circle clockwise as the laser frequency @xmath1 increases , and the resultant phase shift of the reflected field ( with respect to the incident field ) shows a dispersive curve centered at the cavity resonance as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) @xcite . in the pdh method",
    ", this phase shift is converted to a dc electric signal by frequency modulation ( fm ) spectroscopy @xcite , and used as a frequency discrimination signal .",
    "if the phase of the incident laser makes a positive ( negative ) jump on a time scale shorter than the cavity response time @xmath17 , the field inside the cavity can not follow this phase jump and the leakage field relatively shifts clockwise ( counterclockwise ) in the rotating complex plane [ fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) shows a case of positive phase jump ] , resulting in an error signal with the same sign as a positive ( negative ) frequency shift .",
    "this phase - sensitive response at short times @xmath18 is the heart of the pdh laser phase stabilization .",
    "the phase - sensitive response of the pdh frequency discriminator can be explained more formally by its transfer function @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the _ frequency of the laser - frequency modulation _ and",
    "@xmath21 is the gain in the passband @xcite .",
    "the characteristic single - poll roll - off ( 6 db / octave ) and 90@xmath22 phase lag above the cutoff frequency ( @xmath23 ) ensure the prompt response of the discriminator to a sudden phase jump @xcite .",
    "now we consider the case where the role of the cavity is replaced by an atomic vapor .",
    "suppose a laser beam with complex amplitude @xmath4 is incident onto an atomic vapor cell of length @xmath24 containing two - level atoms with resonance frequency @xmath25 and resonance width ( fwhm ) @xmath26 .",
    "we assume here that the complex electric susceptibility of the atomic vapor has a textbook form of nonsaturated two - level atoms : @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a normalized laser frequency detuning and @xmath29 is the maximum of the imaginary part of @xmath30 .",
    "if the vapor cell is optically thin and the attenuation of the incident laser field is little , the transmitted field @xmath31 is , as depicted in fig.[fig1](d ) , approximately given by the sum of the incident field @xmath32 , which travels as if there were no atoms in the cell , and the field @xmath33 produced by incident - field - induced dipole oscillations of atoms @xcite .",
    "the steady - state complex amplitude of the transmitted field is then expressed as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the maximum absorption coefficient of the atomic vapor and @xmath36 is the wave number of the incident laser field .",
    "one can find that the transmitted field @xmath31 has exactly the same form as the cavity reflection field @xmath5 given by eq.([reflectance ] ) and the dipole field @xmath33 plays the same role as the cavity leakage field @xmath7 .",
    "this mathematical equivalence between the cavity and the thin atomic vapor , combined with the fact that the atomic dipole oscillations can not follow a sudden phase change of the incident field for shorter times than the atomic coherence time @xmath37 , naturally leads us to a conclusion that laser phase and frequency stabilization using an optically thin atomic vapor would work .",
    "the above conclusion can be extended to an atomic vapor cell whose optical density is @xmath01 . as long as we consider the time scale shorter than the atomic coherence time , each atomic dipole at a different part of the cell , after a sudden phase change of the incident field , still continues oscillating with the previous phase and contributes independently to the shift of the complex amplitude of the transmitted field , thus enabling a laser phase locking to the atomic dipole oscillations .",
    "the phase shift of the transmitted field can be converted to an electric signal by fm spectroscopy as in the pdh method .",
    "alternatively , the phase shift can be converted to a polarization rotation of the transmitted laser beam by polarization spectroscopy @xcite . if the atoms are prepared such that only the @xmath38 components of the linearly polarized incident laser beam interacts with the atoms and the @xmath39 component just serves as a phase reference , the polarization rotation angle is given by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the phase shift of the @xmath38 component of the transmitted laser beam .",
    "a balanced polarimeter can convert this polarization rotation to a photocurrent signal @xmath42 with a relation @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the photocurrent signal corresponding to the total transmitted beam power @xcite .",
    "this phase - to - photocurrent conversion by polarization spectroscopy was utilized in the experiment described below .",
    "the transfer function of a frequency discriminator based on polarization spectroscopy can be derived using eq .",
    "( [ dipole ] ) on the assumption that the intensity of the incident laser beam is well below the saturation intensity and the atomic vapor is optically thin .",
    "if we suppose that the instantaneous frequency of the incident laser beam has a time dependence of @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the maximum frequency deviation and @xmath47 is the modulation frequency , the resultant time dependence of the photocurrent signal at the balanced polarimeter is calculated to be @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a normalized modulation frequency ( see appendix for a detailed derivation ) .",
    "equation ( [ transfer ] ) shows that the transfer function of the frequency discriminator is @xmath50 , where @xmath51 .",
    "this transfer function has exactly the same form as that for a pdh frequency discriminator if we replace @xmath52 with @xmath53 , supporting the above conclusion that laser phase and frequency stabilization using atomic dipole oscillations would work .",
    "we note that the conversion of a phase jump in the incident field into a shift of the complex amplitude of the transmitted field by an atomic vapor discussed above has the same origin as the phenomena known as frequency ( fm ) noise to amplitude ( am ) noise conversion @xcite , or fm noise to optical rotation ( or ) noise conversion @xcite ; the latter exactly corresponds to the case we have considered here . for gas - cell - based optical atomic clocks @xcite or magnetometers @xcite ,",
    "fm - to - am or fm - to - or noise conversion is undesirable because it degrades the signal to noise ratio in the transmitted light and limits the ultimate performance of the device . on the other hand , for our method to work ,",
    "fm - to - or noise conversion is essential and inevitable .",

    "the dfb laser was installed in a commercial mount ( thorlabs tcldm9 ) featuring a bias - t current modulation input with a bandwidth of 0.2 to 500 mhz , and driven by a low - noise laser diode current controller ( thorlabs ldc201uln ) .",
    "most of the power ( @xmath020 mw ) in the beam from the dfb laser was used for laser linewidth measurement as described below , and a small portion ( @xmath02 mw ) of the beam was used for laser phase and frequency stabilization by polarization spectroscopy of the rb d2 line ( natural width @xmath55 mhz ) @xcite .",
    "the optical setup was basically the same as the previous works which demonstrated laser frequency stabilization using polarization spectroscopy @xcite . a circularly polarized pump beam and a linearly polarized probe beam , both of which had almost the same diameters ( @xmath05 mm ) and powers ( @xmath01 mw ) ,",

    "this is because the @xmath65 component of the probe beam , as depicted in fig.3(b ) , predominantly interacts with the atoms in both of the two pump - probe configurations which contribute to the crossover transition .",
    "the @xmath66 and @xmath67 transitions were not resolved from the crossover transition in the pr and the sa spectra because the intensities of the pump and the probe beams were comparable with the saturation intensity ( @xmath68 mw/@xmath69 for the unresolved @xmath70 transition ) and the width of each transition was power - broadened to @xmath010 mhz @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the observed maximum absorption of 18% in the sa spectrum @xcite was solely due to the absorption of the @xmath65 component of the probe beam , the maximum optical density of the rb vapor for this component is @xmath71 = 0.44 .",

    "<S> in analogy to the pound - drever - hall method , which uses a cavity as a memory of the laser phase , this method uses atomic coherence ( dipole oscillations ) as a phase memory of the transmitting laser field . a preliminary experiment using a distributed feedback laser diode and a rubidium vapor cell demonstrates a shot - noise - limited laser linewidth reduction ( from 2 mhz to 20 khz ) . </S>",
    "<S> this method would improve the performance of gas - cell - based optical atomic clocks and magnetometers and facilitate laser - cooling experiments using narrow transitions . </S>"
