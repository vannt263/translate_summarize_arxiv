    "physical layer security has been a very active area of research in information theory .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for overviews of recent progress in this field .",
    "a basic model of physical layer security is a wiretap / broadcast channel @xcite with two receivers , a legitimate receiver and an eavesdropper .",
    "both the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper channels are assumed to be _ known _ at the transmitter . by exploring the ( statistical ) difference between the legitimate receiver channel and the eavesdropper channel , one may design coding schemes that can deliver a message reliably to the legitimate receiver while keeping it asymptotically perfectly secret from the eavesdropper .    while assuming the transmitter s knowledge of the legitimate receiver channel might be reasonable ( particularly when a feedback link is available ) , assuming that the transmitter knows the eavesdropper channel is _ unrealistic _ in most scenarios .",
    "this is mainly because the eavesdropper is an _",
    "adversary _ , who usually has no incentive to help the transmitter to acquire its channel state information .",
    "hence , it is critical that physical layer security techniques are designed to withstand the _ uncertainty _ of the eavesdropper channel .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a communication scenario where there are _ multiple _ possible realizations for the eavesdropper channel . which realization will actually occur is _ unknown _ to the transmitter .",
    "our goal is to design coding schemes such that the number of _ secure _ bits delivered to the legitimate receiver depends on the _ actual _ realization of the eavesdropper channel .",
    "more specifically , when the eavesdropper channel realization is weak , _ all _ bits delivered to the legitimate receiver need to be secure .",
    "in addition , when the eavesdropper channel realization is strong , a prescribed _ part _ of the bits needs to _ remain _ secure .",
    "we call such codes _ security embedding codes _ , referring to the fact that high - security bits are now embedded into the low - security ones .",
    "we envision that such codes are naturally useful for the secrecy communication scenarios where the information bits are _ not _ created equal : some of them have more security priorities than the others and hence require stronger security protections during communication .",
    "for example , in real wireless communication systems , control plane signals have higher secrecy requirement than data plane transmissions , and signals that carry users identities and cryptographic keys require stronger security protections than the other signals .",
    "a key question that we consider is at what expense one may allow part of the bits to enjoy stronger security protections .",
    "note that a  naive \" security embedding scheme is to design two separate secrecy codes to provide two different levels of security protections , and apply them to two separate parts of the information bits . in this scheme",
    ", the high - security bits are protected using a stronger secrecy code and hence are communicated at a lower rate .",
    "the overall communication rate is a _ convex _ combination of the low - security bit rate and the high - security bit rate and hence is lower than the low - security bit rate .",
    "moreover , this rate loss becomes larger as the portion of the high - security bits becomes larger and the additional security requirement ( for the high - security bits ) becomes higher .",
    "the main result of this paper is to show that it is possible to have a significant portion of the information bits enjoying additional security protections _ without _ sacrificing the overall communication rate .",
    "this further justifies the name  security embedding , \" as having part of the information bits enjoying additional security protections is now only an added bonus . more specifically ,",
    "in this paper , we call a secrecy communication scenario _ embeddable _ if a _",
    "fraction of the information bits can enjoy additional security protections without sacrificing the overall communication rate , and we call it",
    "_ perfectly embeddable _ if the high - security bits can be communicated at _ full _ rate ( as if the low - security bits do not exist ) without sacrificing the overall communication rate .",
    "key to achieve optimal security embedding is to _ jointly _ encode the low - security and high - security bits ( as opposed to separate encoding as in the naive scheme ) .",
    "in particular , the low - security bits can be used as ( part of ) the _ transmitter randomness _ to protect the high - security bits ( when the eavesdropper channel realization is strong ) ; this is a key feature of our proposed security embedding codes .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : wtc ] , we briefly review some basic results on the secrecy capacity and optimal encoding scheme for several classical wiretap channel settings .",
    "these results provide performance and structural benchmarks for the proposed security embedding codes . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mswtc ] , an information - theoretic formulation of the security embedding problem is presented , which we term as _ two - level security wiretap channel_. a coding scheme that combines rate splitting , superposition coding , nested binning and channel prefixing is proposed and is shown to achieve the secrecy capacity region of the channel in several scenarios .",
