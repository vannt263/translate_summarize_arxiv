    "the vanadate @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 has attracted a considerable interest recently as the second inorganic compound undergoing the spin - peierls transition ( at the highest known temperature for the spin - peierls compounds , @xmath3  k  @xcite ) .",
    "the spin - peierls transition is expected to occur within a system of linear spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnetic chains coupled to a three - dimensional phonon field . as a result of such a coupling , magnetic atoms of the chain dimerize and",
    "a spin gap opens  @xcite .",
    "one - dimensional magnetic properties of nav@xmath1o@xmath2 above 35  k follow from magnetic susceptibility  @xcite , esr  @xcite and angle - resolved photoemission  @xcite measurements .    below 35 k the lattice dimerizes , as observed by x - ray  @xcite and raman  @xcite scattering , infrared transmission  @xcite and reflection  @xcite measurements , while the magnetic susceptibility decreases isotropically , thus showing a spin gap formation  @xcite .",
    "the size of the gap @xmath8  mev follows from inelastic neutron scattering study of nav@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals  @xcite .",
    "the structure of nav@xmath1o@xmath2 contains double chains of edge sharing distorted vo@xmath2 pyramids running along the orthorhombic @xmath9-axis ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "these double chains are linked together via common corners of the pyramids to form the @xmath10-layers .",
    "na atoms lie between the layers  @xcite . the structure of nav@xmath1o@xmath2 looks like the structure of v@xmath1o@xmath2  @xcite intercalated with sodium . in an early x - ray room temperature investigation on polycrystalline samples of nav@xmath1o@xmath2",
    "carpy and galy  @xcite suggested the noncentrosymmetric space group @xmath11-@xmath12 with two nonequivalent vanadium positions in the unit cell .",
    "the picture of magnetic chains of v@xmath6o@xmath2 ( @xmath13 ) pyramids isolated by nonmagnetic chains of v@xmath14o@xmath2 ( @xmath15 ) pyramids proposed to account for one - dimensional magnetic properties of this mixed valence ( v@xmath16 ) compound is compatible with this space group  @xcite .",
    "however , the recent redetermination of the structure by single crystal x - ray diffraction at room temperature was in favor of the centrosymmetric @xmath4-@xmath17 group with only one vanadium position in the structure  @xcite .",
    "though the topology of the structure remains essentially the same as in the previously proposed noncentrosymmetric space group  @xcite , the possibility for charge ordering is , however , lost in the new higher symmetry group .",
    "smolinski at al .",
    "@xcite and horsch and mack  @xcite suggested a quarter - filled ladder model for nav@xmath1o@xmath2 , with the spins carried by v ",
    "o  v molecular orbitals on the rungs of the ladder .",
    "they argued that the exchange interaction along the ladder is much greater than that between the neighboring ladders which would explain the one - dimensional magnetic properties of the high temperature phase of nav@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the transition at 35  k was supposed to be an ordinary spin - peierls transition .",
    "quite recent @xmath18v - nmr experiment on a single - crystalline sample of nav@xmath1o@xmath2 also revealed only one vanadium position in the high temperature phase but pointed unambiguously to the existence of two different vanadium sites occupied by v@xmath6 and v@xmath14 at liquid helium temperatures  @xcite .",
    "thus , the transition at 35  k is connected with a structure and a charge ordering processes .",
    "very recently , seo and fukuyama  @xcite and mostovoy and khomskii  @xcite proposed a zig - zag scheme of v@xmath6v@xmath14 ordering .",
    "seo and fukuyama argued that , as a result , two - dimensional lattice of antiferromagnetic dimers is formed  @xcite , while mostovoy and khomskii gave reasons in support of a system of alternating chains  @xcite .",
    "thalmeier and fulde @xcite have presented some theoretical reasons for the primary charge ordering which provides neighboring linear v@xmath6 and v@xmath14 chains with the subsequent spin - peierls transition .",
    "two close transitions near 35 k in nav@xmath1o@xmath2 were detected by kppen et al . by the thermal expansion measurements @xcite .    in view of these recent works ,",
    "the symmetry problem of the high temperature phase seems to be a matter of great urgency .",
    "raman and infrared measurements could give an additional information to clarify the question whether the space group is centrosymmetric or not , because of totally different selection rules in these two cases .",
    "we reanalyzed our earlier infrared and raman spectra of nav@xmath1o@xmath2 @xcite and found that they are in a better agreement with the centrosymmetric @xmath4 space group than with the noncentrosymmetric @xmath11 one .",
    "however , in our work  @xcite we did not measure infrared spectra in the @xmath19 polarization . also , the signal - to - noise ratio of raman spectra was rather low . in the present work ,",
    "we reinvestigate vibrational spectra of the high temperature phase of nav@xmath1o@xmath2 using different single crystals , including extraordinary big ones .",
    "we present far - infrared reflectivity as well as raman - scattering spectra for all principal polarizations .",
    "in addition , transmittance spectra were studied .",
    "we show that our results are in a much better agreement with the centrosymmetric @xmath4 group than with the noncentrosymmetric @xmath11 one .",

    "the samples were checked with x - ray diffraction , magnetization and esr measurements .",

    "the phonon at about 150  @xmath36 could not be fitted well .",
    "this line is strongly asymmetric in transmittance spectra , obviously , due to the interaction with the underlying broad band .    a small bump in reflection at 939  @xmath36 shown by the arrow in fig  2 corresponds to the fano - type resonance @xcite well seen in the absorbance spectrum ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "one more such a resonance becomes visible below 200  k at the frequency of about 91  @xmath36 ( see fig .  4 and also ref .",
    "we fitted the absorption coefficient in the vicinity of these two strongly asymmetric lines by the expression  @xcite : @xmath93 where @xmath94 , @xmath95 is a slowly varying broad band absorption ( it is shown by a dashed line in the vicinity of the 939  @xmath36 sharp resonance in fig .  3 ) , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 being variable parameters .",

    "simultaneously , a continuum absorption diminishes markedly in this spectral region while it practically does not change at the maximum of the low - frequency hump at 320  @xmath36 .    with decreasing the temperature , besides the asymmetric resonance at 91  @xmath36 in @xmath31 transmission , two lines at 215 and 225  @xmath36 appear in @xmath35 transmittance spectra as well @xcite .",
    "we have studied the resonances at 91 and 939  @xmath36 ( @xmath31 ) ; 215 and 225  @xmath36 ( @xmath35 ) for the samples of different thicknesses and found that while the intensity of 91 , 939 and 225  @xmath36 lines grow proportionally to the sample thickness @xmath5 ( that is , @xmath110 ) , the intensity of the 215  @xmath36 line does not , practically , depend on the thickness ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "consequently , while the frequencies 91 and 939  @xmath36 ( @xmath31 ) and 225  @xmath36 ( @xmath35 ) correspond to intrinsic resonances , @xmath112  @xmath36 must refer to a surface excitation .",

    "an interference pattern was observed in ( @xmath31 ) and ( @xmath32 ) transmittance spectra of the samples of good quality .",

    "the appropriate values of @xmath116 are listed in table  1 .",
    "we also looked for the higher order vibrational spectra by measuring the transmittance of thick ( @xmath5=0.43.0  mm ) samples in the frequency range 10004000  @xmath36 . while no pronounced features were found in @xmath31 and @xmath35 polarizations , sharp resonances",
    "were observed in @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) polarization at 1930 , 2858 and , possibly , 1072 and 1270  @xmath36 , the latter two lines being somewhat masked by the edge of a strong phonon at 955  @xmath36 ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "polarized room - temperature raman spectra of nav@xmath1o@xmath2 in the spectral range 801000  @xmath36 are shown in fig .",
    "one can see immediately that the three diagonal components @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 of the raman scattering tensor differ markedly one from another which points to a considerable anisotropy of the structure .",
    "the most intense spectra were observed in the @xmath72 geometry @xmath122 .",
    "the intensity of the lines marked by asterisks in @xmath123 spectra depended strongly on slight variations in the sample orientation .",
    "evidently , these lines are present due to a leakage of strong lines from @xmath72 geometries .",
    "we failed to assign for certain a weak feature near 100  @xmath36 in the @xmath124 spectrum overlapped by a strong unshifted line present in this geometry .",
    "possibly , it comes from a leakage of a very strong line 90  @xmath36 from the @xmath125 polarization .",
    "frequencies of the observed raman modes together with the calculated ones are collected in table  2 .    as we have already communicated  @xcite , besides relatively narrow lines , a broad band with a maximum near 600  @xmath36",
    "is observed in the @xmath126 spectrum ( see fig .",
    "since this band appears under both 514.5  nm and 488  nm excitation , we conclude that it originates from the raman scattering process .",
    "however , a big width of this band ( 213  @xmath36 ) , practically independent of the temperature , does not permit to assign it to fundamental modes .",
    "we have also studied raman spectra of na - deficient samples na@xmath127v@xmath1o@xmath2 ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "the most prominent changes occur in the @xmath72 ( @xmath119 ) spectrum ( see fig .",
    "the 447  @xmath36 raman line moves to higher frequencies with growing @xmath129 .",
    "its position shown by the vertical dashed lines in fig .",
    "7 is 477  @xmath36 for the sample with @xmath130 .",
    "the maximum of the broad band moves in the opposite direction , namely , from 632  @xmath36 for @xmath131 to 562  @xmath36 for @xmath130 . such a change of the frequency difference between these two raman bands is caused , probably , by a change of intermode interaction .",
    "the shape of the broad band can be approximated well by a gaussian for all the values of @xmath129 , its width growing from 213  @xmath36 for @xmath131 to 290  @xmath36 for @xmath130 .",
    "as for phonon raman lines , their shape is almost lorenzian , their width grows too .",
    "for example , the lines 177 , 301 and 531  @xmath36 broaden from , correspondingly , 11 , 18 and 20  @xmath36 for @xmath131 to 16 , 27 and 34  @xmath36 for @xmath130 .",
    "the broadening of raman bands with growing @xmath129 is , evidently , connected with an increase of lattice disorder .",
    "it is difficult to compare absolute intensities of the spectra for different @xmath129 .",
    "however , certain conclusions concerning the relative intensities in a given spectrum can be drawn .",
    "the most prominent features are the growth of the intensity of the 301  @xmath36 line and the appearance of a new line at 988  @xmath36 for @xmath130 .",
    "all these results were obtained by decomposing of the observed spectrum into separate spectral contours .",
    "an example of such a decomposition is shown in fig .",
    "8 .      to obtain an information about the phonon spectrum of nav@xmath1o@xmath2 throughout the brillouin zone which is necessary for the analysis of the spin - phonon interaction effects",
    ", we have considered the lattice dynamics of this crystal in the framework of the rigid ion model .",
    "the goal of this study is to display the basic pairwise interion interactions which determine the main features of the measured raman and infrared transmittance and reflectance spectra .    from the measured large to  lo splittings of some normal modes at the brillouin zone center ( @xmath132 point ) , it is clear that long - range coulomb forces play an essential role in the formation of the vibrational spectrum of nav@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the potential energy of the lattice was represented by a sum of coulomb and non - coulomb interactions .",
    "the coulomb terms in the dynamical matrix were calculated exactly by using the ewald method .",
    "non - coulomb interactions in the form of the born - mayer potentials with the exponential dependence on the interionic distance @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) were introduced between v - o ( five bonds per vanadium ion ) , na  o ( eight bonds per sodium ion ) and o  o neighboring ions at interionic distances shorter than 0.325  nm . because of the nonequivalence of the oxygen o1 , o2 and o3 ions we should introduce different potentials for different types of bonding . at the initial step we confined ourselves by only 10 fitting parameters ( instead of 34 independent force constants for the v@xmath1o@xmath2 lattice in ref.@xcite ) including ion charges @xmath135 ( a condition of the lattice neutrality brings the relation @xmath136na@xmath137o1@xmath138v@xmath138o2@xmath138o3@xmath139 about ) and @xmath140 @xmath141 constants for v  o , na  o and o  o pairs of ions .",

    "o , na  o and o  o bonds , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that we had to correct some force constants calculated with these potentials ( the relative values of corrections are the most significant for the distant o ",

    "the calculated frequencies of the lattice normal modes at the brillouin zone center are presented in tables 1 and 2 for infrared and , correspondingly , raman active modes .",
    "the calculated frequencies of silent @xmath71 modes equal 120 , 167 and 572  @xmath36 .",
    "acoustical properties of the lattice are defined by nine elastic constants , the predicted values of @xmath173 @xmath174 @xmath175 ( in units of 10@xmath176 n / m@xmath177 ) are less dependent on variations of the model parameters .",
    "the measured components of the high frequency dielectric tensor @xmath178 remarkably differ from unity ( see table  1 ) , thus a neglect of the electronic polarization is a very crude approximation in this case , in particular , when estimating lo  to splittings in the @xmath132 point .",
    "however , for most of the infrared active normal modes , our model gives a satisfactory description of the longitudinal macroscopic electric field induced by the vibrations of ions .",
    "a very strong damping of the @xmath76 to mode at the frequency of 591  @xmath36 may be the reason for a large difference between the calculated and measured lo  to splitting ( see table 1 ) ; in the case of the @xmath77 to mode at 365  @xmath36 our model gives strongly overestimated frequency of the corresponding lo mode .",
    "rather large discrepancies between several calculated frequencies of the raman active modes and the experimental data ( see table  2 ) clearly demonstrate that some significant interactions , in particular , the three body forces , greatly affecting frequencies of the bending vibrations , are to be included in the more thorough study of the lattice dynamics of this system .    may be , the most interesting result of this analysis of the nav@xmath1o@xmath2 lattice dynamics is the predicted soft mode behavior of the transverse acoustical mode at the brillouin zone boundary ( with the wave vector @xmath179 ) polarized in the @xmath180-plane . due to a competition of the long range coulomb and short range non - coulomb forces , the corresponding branch of the vibrational spectrum moves to the range of imaginary frequencies when approaching the @xmath181 point thus opening a possibility to consider the nav@xmath1o@xmath2 crystal as an improper virtual ferroelastic .",
    "to stabilize the lattice in respect to @xmath181-excitations , we had to introduce an attractive interaction between the neighboring v@xmath182 and v@xmath1 ( v@xmath20 and v@xmath183 ) ions along the @xmath23-axis with the significant bending force constant of approximately 5 n / m .",
    "the charge ordering in the subsystem of v ions can destroy a balance between the forces of different signs and induce a freezing of the soft mode atomic displacements ( the unit cell doubles in the @xmath24 direction , the neighboring layers shift in the opposite directions , in each layer the right and left legs of the vanadium ladders become nonequivalent due to shifts of v@xmath182v@xmath1 and v@xmath20v@xmath183 rungs along opposite directions in the @xmath180-plane ) as a precursor of the subsequent magnetic ordering with doubling of a unit cell in @xmath23- , @xmath9- and @xmath24-directions .",
    "table  3 summarizes the observed vibrational modes together with their interpretation both in centrosymmetric @xmath184 and noncentrosymmetric @xmath185 groups .",
    "while the former group explains naturally the experimental data provided one raman and three infrared frequencies not being detected , the latter group leads to an assumption that 22 of 45 expected raman and 23 of 37 expected infrared modes were not detected .",
    "moreover , only three frequencies ( 90  @xmath36 , 174 and 951  @xmath36 ) coincide within the experimental precision ( @xmath186  @xmath36 ) in the sets of raman and infrared modes corresponding to a given irreducible representation of the noncentrosymmetric group , while all the modes should be both raman and infrared active in that case .",
    "we also remind once more that we failed to obtain a realistic set of force constants when carrying out the lattice dynamics calculations in the assumption of @xmath185 noncentrosymmetric space group .",
    "we consider our raman and infrared data as well as the results of lattice dynamics calculations to support strongly the conclusion of the previous structural study  @xcite that the space group of nav@xmath1o@xmath187 above @xmath3  k is the centrosymmetric @xmath184 rather than noncentrosymmetric @xmath185 group . from the point of view of @xmath184 group",
    "it is also easy to explain the results of a recent @xmath18v - nmr study  @xcite that revealed only one vanadium position at elevated temperatures .      as we have already mentioned in the introduction , the structure of nav@xmath1o@xmath2 looks like the structure of v@xmath1o@xmath2 intercalated with na .",
    "the v  o bond lengths within the vanadium - oxygen layers are close in these two compounds ( see table  4 ) .",
    "the longest bond within the layer interconnects two v@xmath1o@xmath2 units in the crystal unit cell ( see fig .",
    "1b where this bond is indicated as a dashed line ) .",
    "so , it is of a certain meaning to classify the @xmath188 crystal vibrations on the basis of internal vibrations of the v@xmath1o@xmath2 `` molecule '' ( @xmath189 point symmetry group ) split into davydov doublets of the @xmath190 factor group by an interaction between two `` molecules '' in the crystal unit cell .",

    ". splittings of these doublets can be as big as 100  @xmath36 due to coulomb interactions and , in particular , due to interactions between the adjacent v ions through the common neighbors ( o2 ions ) along the chains ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "many of the vibrational frequencies of na v@xmath1o@xmath2 are close to those of",
    "v@xmath1o@xmath2  @xcite .",

    "the asymmetric lineshapes of the infrared active modes at 91 , 150 , 939  @xmath36 in @xmath31 polarization bring into evidence a strong interference between these modes and a continuum observed just in this polarization .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the fact that the spectral line near 91  @xmath36 becomes perfectly symmetric when the continuum absorption vanishes in this spectral range below the phase transition temperature @xmath3  k. in our earlier work @xcite we argued that these changes are connected with the opening of a gap in the magnetic excitation spectrum at @xmath233 , the observed continuum being due to two - magnon absorption .    however , such a straightforward interpretation is no more valid in the case of the space group @xmath4 .",
    "it should be revised , taking into account possible electronic excitations in this frequency range , as discussed in the previous section , and a charge ordering at the transition temperature .",

    "o3 stretching vibration .",
    "this stretching mode is well localized which results in its small dispersion over the brillouin zone , thus delivering a narrow two - phonon band , in accordance with the experimental observation .",

    "we have also performed the lattice dynamics calculations , in the framework of the rigid ion model , for both proposed in the literature structures of nav@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "we failed to obtain any physically well - grounded set of parameters providing a stable @xmath11 lattice structure .",
    "thus , our infrared and raman experimental data , as well as the results of lattice dynamics calculations support strongly the conclusion of the previous structural study  @xcite that the space group of nav@xmath1o@xmath2 above @xmath3  k is the centrosymmetric @xmath184 rather than noncentrosymmetric @xmath185 group .",
    "this conclusion leads to important physical consequences .",
    "in particular , it requires to revise the interpretation of one - dimensional magnetic properties of nav@xmath1o@xmath2 and of the phase transition at 35  k considered earlier as an ordinary spin - peierls transition .",
    "an interpretation of the earlier observed broad bands in the near and far infrared absorption  @xcite needs to be reconsidered too .    using the values of effective charges obtained in the process of lattice dynamics calculations and fitting the total crystal field splitting to the width of the v@xmath240 bands  @xcite , we estimated the crystal field energies of the @xmath240 electron localized at the vanadium site .",
    "it follows from this estimate that the observed near infrared broad band absorption of nav@xmath1o@xmath2  @xcite can be interpreted as phonon assisted @xmath7 transitions .",

    "strongly asymmetric spectral lines observed in @xmath31 absorbance spectra of nav@xmath1o@xmath2 bring into evidence a strong interference between relatively narrow phonon lines and the underlying continuum .",
    "this points to an interaction between crystal vibrations and magnetic or electronic excitations .",
    "the detailed physical interpretation of the observed phenomenon depends on the nature of the far infrared @xmath31 polarized continuum which requires a special investigation .    in conclusion",
