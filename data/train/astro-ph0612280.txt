    "in the last decades galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) have proven to be extremely important astrophysical laboratories for a wide range of problematics .",
    "indeed , the study of their stellar populations address fundamental questions ranging from stellar structure , evolution and dynamics to galaxy formation and the early epoch of the universe . containing some of the oldest stars known , they are _ fossils _ from the remote and violent epoch of galaxy formation . they also serve as test particles for studying galaxy dynamics and to test stellar dynamical models .",
    "being the largest aggregates in which all post main sequence ( ms ) stars can be individually observed , they serve as fiducial templates for understanding the integrated light from distant , unresolved stellar systems . in this respect ,",
    "the bulge gcs provide ideal templates to explore the high metallicity regime and thus to study the stellar content of extra ",
    "galactic bulges and ellipticals .",
    "however , the high and patchy extinction , which makes optical observations difficult to impossible along most bulge lines of sight , coupled with the limited performances of the past generation of near  ir instrumentation , prevented accurate determinations of the bulge gcs basic properties ( as age , metallicity , distance , etc ) , as already existing since a long time in the case of the halo clusters . the current generation of ground  based ir instrumentation with high spatial resolution and wide field coverage , and with the future availability of the james webb space telescope will allow us to resolve the brightest giants in galaxies up to several mpc away .",
    "hence , a homogeneous compilation of the bulge gcs properties to be used as empirical templates of metal  rich stellar populations , is thus strongly urgent . in this framework ,",
    "our group started a long  term project devoted to fully characterize the stellar populations in the bulge gc system , by using color ",
    "magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and luminosity functions ( lfs ) in the near  ir ( see @xcite ",

    "we present the largest , homogeneous near  ir photometric database of bulge gc ever obtained . for each clusters ,",
    "the compilation includes : _",
    "i ) _ the photometric catalog ; _ ii ) _ the rgb mean ridge line , ; _ iii ) _ accurate reddening , distance , and metallicity determinations ; _ iv ) _ the luminosity of the main rgb evolutionary features ( i.e. the bump and the tip ) ; and _ v ) _ the mean magnitude of the horizontal  branch red clump ( hb  rc ) . moreover , in order to be easily accessible by the community , the compilation would be also provided in electronic form .    the programme cluster sample is presented in   2 , while   3 is devoted to the detailed description of the observations , data reduction , and derived cmds of a sample of 12 bulge clusters , recently observed , and presented here for the first time .

    "the targets selection has been performed by defining _",

    "for this sample , a detailed description of the observations , data reduction , cmds and physical properties of each cluster is provided in the following sub  sections .",
    "j , h and k@xmath3 images of the clusters in _ sample c _ were obtained during three observing runs on june 2004 , july 2005 , and june 2006 using the near  ir camera sofi , mounted at the eso / ntt telescope . during",

    "all the secured images are roughly centered on the cluster center .",
    "note that the region covered by our observations allows us to sample a significant fraction of the total cluster light ( typically @xmath580 - 95% ) in all the programme clusters . during the 8 nights of observations",
    "the average seeing was always quite good ( fwhm@xmath6 ) .",
    "every image has been background  subtracted by using sky fields located several arcmin away from the cluster center , and flat ",
    "field corrected using halogen lamp exposures , acquired with the standard sofi calibration setup .",
    "standard crowded field photometry , including psf modeling , was carried out on each frame by using daophotii / allstar @xcite .",
    "for each cluster , two photometric catalogs ( derived from high and standard resolution images ) , listing the instrumental j , h and k@xmath3 magnitudes , were obtained by cross - correlating the single - band catalogs .",
    "the standard and high resolution catalogs have been combined by means of a proper weighted average , weighting more the high resolution measurements in the innermost region of the cluster . in principle , this strategy allows to minimize the blending effects .",
    "the internal photometric accuracy has been estimated from the _ rms _ frame  to  frame scatter of multiple stars measurements . over",
    "most of the rgb extension , the internal errors are quite low ( @xmath7 mag ) , increasing up to @xmath8 mag at @xmath9 .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes were then converted into the 2mass photometric system mag in the zero  point calibration in all three bands has been estimated . ] , and the star positions astrometrized onto 2mass0.2 arcsec in both r.a . and dec . ] as done for the clusters in _ samples a and b_.    since for terzan  6 only high resolution data were acquired , we also used j , h and k images obtained with the irac2 camera ( mounted at the eso / mpi  2.2 m telescope ) , in order to cover a larger area ( @xmath10 4@xmath44 ) .",
    "the derived calibrated catalog has been then merged with that one obtained from the sofi observations .",
    "note that , as already discussed in @xcite the calibration of the k irac2 photometry onto the k@xmath3 sofi one requires negligible color term .",
    "figure  [ cmds ] presents the derived ir cmds of the global sample of 24 gcs .",
    "as shown in the figure , the photometric catalogs span the entire rgb extension , from the tip to @xmath102 - 5  magnitudes below the hb ( depending on the cluster extinction ) .",
    "the main cluster properties such as reddening and distance have been derived by using a differential method based on the comparison of cmds and lfs of clusters with similar hb morphology . however , this method allows to derive reliable estimates of reddening and distance only for intermediate ",
    "high metallicity clusters , whose cmd shows a red clumpy hb morphology . in fact , the location in magnitude of the hb ",
    "lf peak can be used as a reference feature and safely compared with that one of the template cluster . in 5 metal ",
    "poor clusters ( i.e. ngc6256 , ngc6273 , ngc6293 , ngc6355 and ngc6401 ) the blue hb morphology coupled with the relatively high reddening and the remarkable level of field contamination prevented a safe location of the hb level , and thus the use of the differential method .",
    "hence , in these cases the cluster reddening and distance have been obtained by using the empirical method presented by ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  hereafter fvo06 ) , which allows one to simultaneously get reddening , distance and metallicity of a stellar system by using a few observables , like the rgb slope , tip , and mean ridge line , of the [ k , j  k ] cmd .",
    "the derived cluster reddening and distance have been used to transform the observed cmds and rgb ridge lines into the absolute plane , and to measure the following parameters : _",
    "i ) _ ( j  k)@xmath11 and ( j  h)@xmath11 colors at 4 fixed absolute magnitude levels ( @xmath12 ) ; _ ii ) _ the absolute @xmath13 and @xmath14 magnitudes at constant ( j  k)@xmath15(j  h)@xmath16 colors ; and _ iii ) _ the slope in the [ k , j ",
    "k ] and [ h , j  h ] planes .",
    "then , by using the empirical calibrations from vfo04a linking this set of photometric indices to the cluster metal content , we finally derived the photometric metallicity estimates in the @xcite scale .",
    "hence , hereafter the notation [ fe / h ] refers to the @xcite scale . note that , to derive the global metallicity [ m / h ] , which takes into account the iron as well as the @xmath17element abundances , we used the calibrations presented in fvo06 within the bulge - like enrichment scenario .",
    "hence , accordingly to carney s ( 1996 ) suggestions and the more recent results on the bulge populations ( @xcite for bulge clusters ; and @xcite for giant field stars ) we adopted a [ @xmath17/fe]=0.30 constant over the entire range of metallicity up to solar [ fe / h ] .    in the next paragraphs we present the cmds and rgb fiducial ridge lines for the 12 bulge clusters of _ sample  c_.",
    "we briefly discuss the main cmd properties , and we provide some references for previous published photometries .      ngc  6256 is a heavily reddened cluster in the outer bulge region .",
    "its extinction , whose estimates range from e(b  v)=0.84 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter h96 ) to e(b",
    " v)=1.66 ( * ? ? ?",

    "only two studies of the cluster can be found in the literature .",
    "the first by @xcite based on vi ground  based photometry , and the second by @xcite based on hst bv observations .",
    "however , the derived cmds show an extremely scattered rgb which is barely defined .    in our ir - cmd , shown in fig .",
    "[ cmds ] , the cluster rgb is rather scattered , suggesting the presence of a red component which might be due to the contamination by bulge field stars .",
    "the hb appears as a blue vertical structure at ( j  k)@xmath180.5 and k@xmath1914 typical of low  intermediate metallicity .",
    "the almost blue vertical sequence , at 11.5@xmath19k@xmath1915 and 0.4@xmath19(j  k)@xmath191 , is likely due to the foreground disk stars . in order to investigate the nature of the observed rgb spread",
    ", we compared the sequence morphology in the cmds at different distances from the cluster center ( see fig .  [ 6256rad ] ) .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ 6256rad ] , the reddest rgb component becomes progressively populated as the distance to the cluster center increases , thus confirming that it is due to field stars . as previously done for other highly contaminated clusters ( see i.e. ngc  6304 in vof05 ) ,",
    "the rgb fiducial ridge line has been derived considering only the innermost region of the cluster , typically only the stars lying within 30 \" from the cluster center .",
    "since the absence of a prominent feature such as the red clumpy hb makes difficult to derive the cluster reddening and distance , we used the empirical method ( see fvo06 ) rather than the differential one . from the analysis of the cluster cmd we estimated the rgb slope and the observed rgb - tip to be rgb@xmath20=0.052 and k@xmath21=9.21 , respectively . using these values as input parameters , the computational routine ( assuming the _ bulge  like scenario _ ) , gives a reddening e(b  v)=1.2 , an intrinsic distance modulus ( m - m)@xmath22=14.79 , and metallicities [ fe / h]=1.63  dex , and [ m / h]=1.43  dex . the distance estimate agree with the value by h96 , and",

    "@xcite published the most extensive photometry based on a combination of multi  band high  resolution hst and wide  field ground based observations aimed at studying the cluster dynamical state , finding that the cluster has not experienced core collapse yet .",

    "hence , the observed rgb spread is likely due to the bulk of the bulge field population which is metal  rich . in order to derive the cluster main properties we used the fvo06 empirical method , assuming the _ bulge  like scenario_. we measured the cluster rgb slope considering only those stars lying in the innermost cluster region ( rgb@xmath27=-0.065 ) and we estimated the observed ( k=8.69 ) rgb tip by using the brightest stars in our catalog lying along the rgb ridge line .",

    "the analysis of the cluster cmds and lfs yields a reddening e(b  v)=0.73 ( in excellent agreement with the values found by @xcite and s98 ) , an intrinsic distance modulus ( m  m)@xmath22=14.54 and metallicities [ fe / h]=0.82  dex and [ m / h]=0.63  dex . the significant ( @xmath180.5  mag )",

    "being embedded in a heavily obscured zone , it is affected by a large differential reddening which makes optical observations almost impossible .",

    "from the analysis of the cmd and lf we derived e(b  v)=2.38 , and ( m  m)@xmath22=13.87 .",
    "the reddening value is in between the estimates provided by @xcite and @xcite , while our distance measurement is fully consistent with the one of @xcite .",
    "the photometric indices measured along the cluster rgb by adopting the reddening and distance quoted above , lead the following metallicity estimates : [ fe / h]=0.32  dex and [ m / h]=0.19  dex , thus in excellent agreement with the high  resolution ir spectroscopic result obtained by @xcite ( [ fe / h]=0.21  dex ) .",
    "terzan  6 is another example of heavily reddened cluster in the inner bulge region .",
    "the only available photometric study is the one by @xcite , which provided a [ i , v ",
    "the authors estimated the cluster reddening ( e(b  v)=2.24 ) by comparing the derived cmd with that of ngc  6553 , the cluster distance ( ( m  m)@xmath22=14.23 ) by using the absolute v magnitude of the hb level , and from the rgb morphology they concluded that ter  6 shows intermediate characteristics between 47  tuc and ngc6528/ngc6553 .",
    "our ir observations of ter  6 provided the first ir  cmd ( see fig .",
    "[ cmds ] ) showing a red hb and a curved rgb which are both high  metallicity indicators . from the derived cmd we found e(b  v)=2.35 and ( m  m)@xmath22=14.13 .",
    "both estimates nicely agree with the corresponding values found by @xcite .",
    "the set of ir photometric indices measured by using the rgb ridge lines give a cluster metallicity of [ fe / h]=0.62  dex and [ m / h]=0.43  dex .",
    "the compilation presented in this study is publicy available through the worldwideweb .",
    "the website address is : +      for the entire cluster sample , two separate files are available : the first list the j , h and k photometry for all the measured stars in each cluster , together with the stars absolute position in r.a . and dec . ; the second reports the observed rgb fiducial ridge line in the [ k , j  k ] and [ h , j  h ] planes .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] lists the derived parameters for the 24 clusters , namely the reddening , the distance and the metallicity in both the adopted scales ( columns [ 9,10,11,12 ] , respectively ) .",
    "moreover , by using our distance determinations , the _ ( l , b ) _ galactic coordinates from h96 , and assuming a distance r@xmath22=8  kpc to the galactic center @xcite , we also provided new estimates of the clusters distance from the sun ( d@xmath35 ) , from the galactic center ( r@xmath36 ) , and the distance components x , y , z , in a sun  centered coordinate system ( columns [ 4,5,6,7,8 ] , respectively ) .",
    "finally for each cluster , column [ 13 ] lists the references for the ir photometry .",
    "it is worth mentioning that table  [ tab1 ] lists the largest , homogeneous compilation of bulge gcs obtained so far , whose properties have been derived in a self  consistent way .",
    "in fact , the derived cluster reddening , distance and metallicity are based on _",
    "i ) _ a homogeneous photometric database analyzed by using the same data reduction procedures , and calibrated onto the 2mass photometric system ; _ ii ) _ the f99 distance scale ; _ iii ) _ a uniform and high  resolution metallicity scale @xcite .",
    "the most interesting evolutionary features along the rgb are the so  called bump and tip .",
    "the former flags the point ( during the post  ms evolution of low mass stars ) when the narrow hydrogen  burning shell reaches the discontinuity in the hydrogen distribution profile , generated by the previous innermost penetration of the convective envelope .",
    "besides providing an obvious check on the accuracy of theoretical models of stellar evolution , the identification of the rgb bump in stellar systems can be used as useful tool for providing observational constraints on a number of population parameters , since it is a sensitive function of metal content , helium abundance and stellar population age . from the observational point of view , as emphasized by @xcite and f99 , the combined use of the differential and integrated lfs is the best tool to properly detect the bump .",
    "the evolution along the rgb ends at the so  called rgb tip with helium ignition in the stellar core . in gc stars ,",
    "this event is moderately violent because it takes place in a electron  degenerate core . because the rgb reaches its maximum extension in luminosity for stellar populations older than @xmath3712  gyr ( i.e. when stars with m@xmath38 are evolving off the ms ) and it remains approximately constant with increasing the age of the population , the tip is now widely used as a standard candle for distance determination of stellar systems .",
    "the dependence of the rgb bump and tip luminosities ( in the j , h and k bands . as well as in bolometric ) on the cluster metallicity has been investigated in vfo04b .",
    "here we have extended the same study to the new sample of bulge clusters . in doing this ,",
    "we have adopted the same strategy followed in that paper , where the reader can find a detailed description of the adopted procedures .    for the entire sample ,",
    "the measurements of the main evolutionary features are listed in table  [ tab2 ] : the observed j , h , and k magnitude of the red hb clump ( columns  [ 4 , 5 , 6 ] ) , the j , h , k and bolometric bump ( columns [ 7 , 8 , 9 , 13 ] , respectively ) , and tip ( columns [ 10 , 11 , 12 , 14 ] , respectively ) magnitudes .",
    "the bolometric bump and tip magnitude have been obtained by using the bolometric corrections for population  ii giants computed by @xcite .",
    "[ tip ] shows the absolute rgb tip magnitudes as a function of the metallicity , in both the adopted scales .",
    "the clusters tip determination nicely agree with the empirical relations by vfo04b ( solid lines ) , and with the theoretical prediction by @xcite ( dashed and dotted line , respectively ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ tip_bol ] , a good agreement is also found when we compare the bolometric tip magnitudes , as a function of the clusters metallicity , with the vfo04b empirical relation ( solid lines ) , and with four different theoretical expectations by @xcite ( dashed , dotted and dotted  dashed lines , respectively ) .",
    "[ bump ] plots the absolute j , h and k bump magnitudes of the bulge ( filled circles ) and halo ( open circles ) clusters ( the latter presented in vfo04b ) _ vs _ metallicity , showing that the bump becomes rapidly fainter by increasing the latter .",
    "hence , since with the present study we both enlarged the sample of high metallicity clusters and adopted the recent [ fe / h ] estimates by @xcite based on high  resolution ir spectroscopy , for the two most metal ",
    "rich objects in our sample ( namely , ngc  6528 and ngc  6553 ) , we calibrated new relations .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ bump ] the new calibrations ( solid lines ) differ from the vfo04b ones ( dashed lines ) only in the metal ",
    "rich tail , making the bump somewhat brighter .",
