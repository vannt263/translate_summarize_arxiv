    "clusters of galaxies are the largest gravitationally bound systems in the universe , with typical masses of about 10@xmath0 m@xmath1 , and volumes of about 100 mpc@xmath2 .",
    "most of the gravitating matter in any cluster is in the form of dark matter ( @xmath3 80% ) .",
    "some of the luminous matter is in galaxies ( @xmath3 3% - 5% ) , the rest is in diffuse hot gas ( @xmath3 15% - 17% ) , detected in x - ray through its thermal bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "this thermal plasma , consisting of particles of energies of several kev , is commonly referred to as intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "most of the detailed knowledge of galaxy clusters has been obtained in recent years from the study of icm through x - ray astronomy .",
    "clusters are formed by hierarchical structure formation processes . in this scenario ,",
    "smaller units ( galaxies , groups and small clusters ) formed first and merged under gravitational pull to larger and larger units in the course of time .",
    "cluster mergers are the mechanism by which clusters are assembled .",
    "denser regions form a filamentary structure in the universe , and clusters are formed within filaments , often at their intersection , by a combination of large and small mergers .",
    "major cluster mergers are among the most energetic events in the universe since the big bang @xcite . during mergers ,",
    "shocks are driven into the icm , with the subsequent injection of turbulence .",
    "the merger activity , which has characterized much of the history of the universe , appears to be continuing at the present time and explains the relative abundance of substructure and temperature gradients detected in clusters of galaxies by optical and x - ray observations .",
    "eventually , clusters reach a relaxed state , characterized by a giant galaxy at the center , and enhanced x - ray surface brightness peak in the core .",
    "the hot gas in the centre has a high density , which implies short radiative cooling times , typically one or two order of magnitudes smaller than the hubble time .",
    "therefore energy losses due to x - ray emission are dramatic and produce a temperature drop towards the center .",
    "it was formerly suggested that in these conditions , the icm plasma in the cluster core should cool and condense , giving rise to a steady , pressure - driven inward flow caused by the compression of the hot surrounding gas .",
    "relaxed clusters were then classified as `` cooling flow '' clusters @xcite , with predicted gas mass deposition rates in the cluster center up to 1000 m@xmath1 year@xmath4 .",
    "this model was the subject of much debate , when xmm - newton spectral results failed to confirm the lines and features expected as a product of a steady state cooling flow @xcite .",
    "x - ray and optical studies showed that the gas cooling rates were overestimated by an order of magnitude or more @xcite .",
    "the classical `` cooling - flow '' model has finally been replaced by the paradigm of `` cool - core '' .",
    "observationally cool - cores are characterized by a strong peak in the surface brightness , a significant drop in the temperature and a peak in the metal distribution ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the cooling time is often much shorter than 1 gyr , therefore some source of heating is necessary to balance the radiation losses . at present",
    ", it is widely accepted that the source of heating in cool - core clusters is the agn activity of the brightest cluster galaxy at the center ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "galaxy clusters are also characterized by emission in the radio band .",
    "obvious radio sources are the individual galaxies , whose emission has been observed in recent decades with sensitive radio telescopes .",
    "it often extends well beyond the galaxy optical boundaries , out to hundreds of kiloparsec , and hence it is expected that the radio emitting regions interact with the icm .",
    "this interaction is indeed observed in tailed radio galaxies , and radio sources filling x - ray cavities at the centre of cool - core clusters @xcite .",
    "more puzzling are diffuse extended radio sources , which can not be obviously ascribed to individual galaxies , but are instead associated with the icm .",
    "this radio emission represents a striking feature of clusters , since it demonstrates that the thermal icm plasma is mixed with non - thermal components .",
    "such components are large - scale magnetic fields with a population of relativistic electrons in the cluster volume .",
    "further demonstration of the existence of magnetic fields in the icm is obtained by studies of the faraday rotation of polarized radio galaxies , lying in the background or embedded within the magnetized intracluster medium .",
    "the number density of relativistic particles is of the order of 10@xmath5 @xmath6 , while their lorentz factors are @xmath7 1000 .",
    "magnetic field intensities are around @xmath3 0.1 - 1 @xmath8 g , and the energy density of the relativistic plasma is globally @xmath9 1% than that of the thermal gas .",
    "non - thermal components are nevertheless important for a comprehensive physical description of the intracluster medium in galaxy clusters , and play a major role in the evolution of large - scale structures in the universe .",
    "they can have dynamic and thermodynamic effects : magnetic fields affect the heat conduction in the icm and the gas dynamics , relativistic particles are sources of additional pressure and undergo acceleration processes that can modify the details of the icm heating process .",
    "realistic cosmological simulations of galaxy cluster formation also include non - thermal components , thus a deep knowledge of the properties of these components and of their interplay with the thermal gas are needed to properly constrain the large - scale structure formation scenario .",
    "the discovery of diffuse cluster radio emission has represented an important step in the understanding of the physical processes in clusters of galaxies .",
    "diffuse synchrotron sources are sensitive to the turbulence and shock structures of large - scale environments and provide essential complements to studies at other wavebands .",
    "studies in the radio domain will fill essential gaps in both cluster astrophysics and in the growth of structure in the universe , especially where the signatures of shocks and turbulence , or even the thermal plasma itself , may be otherwise undetectable .",
    "the aim of this review is to present the observational results obtained in recent years in the radio domain related to the diffuse radio sources , in order to give an overview of the state of the art of the current knowledge of non - thermal cluster components .",
    "we will show how the radio properties can be linked to the x - ray properties and to the cluster evolutionary state , and will discuss the physical implications .",
    "cluster non - thermal emission of inverse - compton ( ic ) origin is expected in the hard x - ray domain , due to scattering of the cosmic microwave background photons by the synchrotron relativistic electrons @xcite . to present days ,",
    "the detection of a non - thermal hard tail in the x - ray spectrum of clusters of galaxies has been reported in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) , and it is still debated in some cases .",
    "the presence of a high frequency non - thermal emission is clearly confirmed in the ophiuchus cluster @xcite .",
    "the discussion of this topic is beyond the scope of this review , which is focussed on the results in the radio band .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] the general properties of diffuse cluster radio sources and their classification are presented ; in sect . [ sec:3 ] the problems related to the detection of diffuse emission are outlined ; sects .",
    "[ sec:4 ] , [ sec:5 ] , [ sec:6 ] give the observational properties of radio halos , relics and mini - halo , respectively .",
    "in sect . [ sec:7 ] the current results about magnetic fields are presented .",
    "[ sec:8 ] presents the evidence for radio emission and magnetic fields beyond clusters of galaxies .",
    "[ sec:9 ] briefly summarizes the current models , and sect .",
    "[ sec:10 ] depicts the future prospects .",
    "the intrinsic parameters quoted in this paper are computed with @xmath10cdm cosmology with @xmath11 = 71 km s@xmath4mpc@xmath4 , @xmath12 = 0.27 , and @xmath13 = 0.73 .",
    "values taken from the literature have been scaled to this cosmology .",
    "synchrotron emission is produced by the spiraling motion of relativistic electrons in a magnetic field .",
    "the power emitted by a relativistic electron depends on its energy ( lorentz factor ) and on the magnetic field strength .",
    "the higher the magnetic field strength , the lower the electron energy needed to produce emission at a given frequency .",
    "the case of astrophysical interest is that of a homogeneous and isotropic population of electrons with a power - law energy distribution with index @xmath14 . in this case , if the plasma is optically thin , as in diffuse cluster radio sources , the diagnostics of synchrotron radiation are the following :    \\i ) the emissivity is related to the number density of the relativistic electrons and to the intensity of the magnetic field , and the monochromatic emissivity follows a power - law with spectral index related to the index of the electron energy distribution @xmath15 ; typical observed radio spectra are around 0.7 - 0.8 , consistent with typical values of @xmath14 around 2.5 .",
    "\\ii ) energy losses of the radio emitting particles produce , with passing time , a change in the overall particle energy distribution , which in turn produces a modification of the emitted radio spectrum .",
    "in particular , the spectrum shows a cutoff at frequencies higher than a critical frequency @xmath16 , related to the particle lifetime . therefore aged radio sources show curved spectra and/or spectra steeper that the values 0.7 - 0.8 indicated above ;    \\iii ) the synchrotron radiation from a population of relativistic electrons in a uniform magnetic field is linearly polarized , with the electric ( polarization ) vector perpendicular to the projection of the magnetic field onto the plane of the sky .",
    "the intrinsic polarization degree depends on the particle energy distribution , and equals @xmath3 75% - 80% for typical values of the spectral index .",
    "complex and disordered magnetic field structures decrease the observed degree of polarization ;    \\iv ) the total energy content in a synchrotron radio source depends on the contributions from relativistic particles ( electrons plus protons ) and from magnetic fields ( considering the fraction of the source volume occupied by magnetic fields , i.e. the filling factor ) . from radio data , it is possible to derive , the minimum value of the total energy , which occurs when the contributions of magnetic fields and relativistic particles are approximately equal ( equipartition condition ) . the corresponding magnetic field is commonly referred to as equipartition value b@xmath17 .",
    "rigorous treatments of the synchrotron theory and radiation processes are in @xcite .",
    "useful formulas of common use can be found in @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", there has been growing evidence for the existence of cluster large - scale diffuse radio sources , of synchrotron origin , which have no optical counterpart and no obvious connection to the cluster galaxies , and are therefore associated with the icm @xcite .",
    "the first diffuse radio source detected in a cluster of galaxies is the giant radio halo at the center of the coma cluster @xcite .",
    "several years later , extended diffuse emission was also detected at the periphery of the coma cluster @xcite and at the center of the perseus cluster @xcite .",
    "nowadays , diffuse radio emission with surface brightness down to 0.1 @xmath8jy arcsec@xmath18 at 1.4 ghz is known in about 80 clusters , under several cluster evolutionary conditions ( merging and relaxed clusters ) , at different cluster locations ( center , periphery , intermediate distance ) , and on very different size scales : 100 kpc to @xmath19mpc , ( see fig . [",
    "fig : clcollection ] for several examples ) .",
    "diffuse sources are typically grouped in halos , relics and mini - halos @xcite , according to their location in the cluster and to the cluster type ( merging or cool - core ) .",
    "the three classes will be extensively discussed in the next sections .",
    "we anticipate that halos are hosted in clusters showing merging processes @xcite and are located at the cluster center .",
    "relics are located in cluster peripheral regions of both merging and relaxed clusters .",
    "prototypical examples of these two classes are both in the coma cluster : the radio halo coma c and the relic 1253 + 275 .",
    "mini - halos are hosted in relaxed cool - core clusters , are centrally located , and usually surround a powerful radio galaxy ; the protoype of this class is in the perseus cluster .",
    "it should be remarked here that non - thermal diffuse emission can also be present beyond clusters , indicating the presence of relativistic particles and magnetic fields in very low density environments .",
    "all diffuse radio sources in clusters have very steep radio spectra in common . a clear difference between halos and relics",
    "is in polarization property , with peripheral sources being more strongly polarized than the central ones . a possible problem in the classification of halos and relics could be represented by projection effects . in other words , halos could be actually located at cluster periphery , and simply projected onto the cluster center .",
    "this issue has been analyzed several years ago @xcite , using data at the time on about 30 clusters . from the distribution of projected distances of halos and relics from the cluster center",
    ", it was shown that there is a large excess of sources at the center , thus diffuse sources are not located at random position in clusters .",
    "this indicates that central halos are truly at the cluster center and not simply projected onto it .",
    "moreover , detailed radio images show different morphologies of halos and relics .",
    "there are 42 halos currently known , while 39 clusters show at least 1 relic source ( for a total of 50 relics ) .",
    "this confirms the findings above .",
    "a powerful way to distinguish between the two classes is through the polarization , this will become easy with new generation radio telescopes .    giovannini et al .",
    "@xcite showed that diffuse cluster sources are not present in all galaxy clusters , but are not a phenomenon as rare as formerly believed .",
    "they first showed that diffuse sources with the surface brightness limit of the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss @xcite ) are present in 6%-9% of clusters with l@xmath20 @xmath21 5 @xmath22 10@xmath23 erg / s , but are present in 27%  44% of clusters with l@xmath20 @xmath19 5 @xmath22 10@xmath23 erg / s .",
    "this trend is confirmed for the occurrence of halos and relics , as reported in sect .",
    "[ sec:4 ] and sect .",
    "[ sec:5 ] , respectively .",
    "for the detection of diffuse radio sources , the sensitivity to low surface brightness emission is the critical parameter .",
    "single dish observations are in principle best suited to detect extended emission , however they are generally limited by the high confusion , because of the large beam .",
    "moreover , low angular resolution may prevent the separation of embedded unrelated discrete sources . on the other hand ,",
    "an interferometer is characterized by a smaller observing beam , and thus by lower confusion , but its brightness sensitivity , set primarily by the aperture filling factor and the shortest spacings , may be insufficient .",
    "a proper sampling of the short spacings is vital not only for the detection of an extended source , but more crucially for the determination of the full size and the measurement of the source flux density .",
    "multi - frequency images with a similar uv - coverage are needed to derive spectral index distributions , which can provide information on the age and energy of radio emitting particles",
    ". the total spectral index can be easily obtained , but in many sources confusion problems do not allow a proper determination of low frequency fluxes .    to summarize , the instrument best suited to detect cluster diffuse radio sources should provide a compromise between high sensitivity to surface brightness , and high angular resolution . moreover , since diffuse emission is generally characterized by steep radio spectra , the observations should be carried out at low frequencies ( @xmath9 1.4 ghz ) .",
    "the very large array ( vla ) at 1.4 ghz has been demonstrated to be a very good instrument to detect and study radio halos , owing to its superb sensitivity .",
    "however , it should be noted , as a caveat , that the coma radio halo ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : coma327 ] ) is not detected by westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) and vla observations at 1.4 ghz because of the missing short spacings .",
    "after the discovery of the coma radio halo at 408 mhz with the 250-ft radio telescope at jodrell bank @xcite , confirmed from interferometric cambridge one - mile telescope radio data @xcite , observations carried out mostly with single dish radio telescopes ( arecibo , green bank 300-ft , effelsberg and others ) and the wsrt found about 10 other clusters with a diffuse halo - type radio emission ( see @xcite ) .",
    "jaffe & rudnick @xcite , in their search for radio halos , found an extended emission region in the peripheral region of the coma cluster near the strong radio source coma a ( 3c 277.3 ) .",
    "this was suggested to be a feature of the coma cluster , in the following classified as a relic , thanks to observations at 408 mhz with the northern cross radio telescope at better angular resolution @xcite .",
    "a significant breakthrough in the study of radio halos and other diffuse cluster radio sources was obtained thanks to the all - sky surveys with the vla and wsrt .",
    "giovannini et al .",
    "@xcite , combining radio data from the nvss at 1.4 ghz and x - ray catalogues , detected 18 new halo and relic candidates , in addition to the 11 already known , owing to the large beam and the good surface brightness sensitivity of the vla d configuration .",
    "all new candidates were confirmed by more sensitive targeted observations , mostly performed with the vla .",
    "kempner & sarazin @xcite presented 7 new candidates from a search in the westerbork northern sky survey ( wenss @xcite ) at 327 mhz ; rudnick & lemmerman @xcite searched for mpc - scale radio emission reprocessing wenss radio images .    recently , other extensive radio observations have been published .",
    "we note the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) survey of massive galaxy clusters at z = 0.2 - 0.4 by venturi and collaborators @xcite , who found diffuse sources in 10 clusters ( out of which 3 new halos , 2 new core - halo sources and 3 new halo or relic candidates ) , the gmrt follow up at low frequencies of all clusters known to contain radio halos and relics up to z = 0.4 @xcite , and the observing campaign carried out with the wsrt , vla and gmrt by van weeren et al .",
    "@xcite , who discovery 6 new radio relics , including a probable double system , and 2 radio halos .",
    "the above mentioned studies and their follow - ups have produced rich information in a short time in this field .",
    "radio halos are diffuse radio sources of low surface brightness ( @xmath3 1  0.1 @xmath8jy arcsec@xmath18 at 1.4 ghz ) permeating the central volume of a cluster .",
    "they are typically extended with sizes of @xmath24 1 mpc , regular in morphology , and are unpolarized down to a few percent level , probably because of internal or beam depolarization . the prototype of this class , coma c at the center of the coma cluster ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coma327 ] ) has been studied in detail by many authors ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thanks to the improvements in observations and data reduction procedures , radio halos with a smaller size and irregular morphology have also been detected in rich galaxy clusters .",
    "their properties in most cases are similar to those of giant radio halos .",
    "[ fig : hacollection ] presents images of well known radio halos of different sizes .",
    "a spectacular case is represented by the double merging system , a399 and a401 , which both contain a radio halo and can be considered the only case so far of a double radio halo system ( @xcite , fig .",

    "the classification of relics may be troublesome in some cases .",
    "this may cause small differences from other lists in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "we also note that diffuse sources which arise from agn , in which the nuclear activity has ceased , may be sometimes classified as cluster relics .",

    "they will not be considered here because they are not originated by the icm .",
    "the occurrence of relics in the nvss sample @xcite is higher in clusters showing high x - ray luminosity , reaching about 25% in clusters with l@xmath20 @xmath19 5 @xmath22 10@xmath23 erg / s @xcite .",
    "the redshift distribution of clusters of galaxies , hosting at least one relic , is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : relz ] , where different colors refer to different structures ( sect . [ sec:51 ] ) . as discussed by @xcite",
    ", relic sources at very low redshift could have a large angular extension , and therefore may be missed in interferometric observations because of the poor coverage of short spacings .",
    "however , owing to the irregular and elongated structure of most relics , this observational problem is not as crucial as in the more regular and diffuse halo sources . relics are detected up to z @xmath3 0.4 , and their distribution with redshift is similar to that of radio halos . the low number of high redshift relics could be due to selection effects , but could also be a real trend , due e.g. to the evolution of cluster mergers , or to the inverse compton losses which become more relevant at increasing redshift .",
    "deeper radio surveys and cluster catalogues are necessary to investigate this point .      after the discovery of the prototypical relic 1253 + 275 in the coma cluster ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comarelic ] ) , different morphologies have been found to be associated with relics ( see e.g. @xcite ) : classical sources are elongated and located in the periphery of galaxy clusters , but more regular and roundish structures have also been detected , which are located nearer the cluster center and/or in peripheral regions .",
    "kempner et al .",
    "@xcite , in a classification of cluster radio sources , suggested that radio relics could be distinguished in two classes : those associated with a previous agn activity , called radio phoenix , and those related to the icm , named radio gischt .",
    "this classification has been used somewhat in the literature .",
    "however , it implies that the origin of a relic source has to be established , in order to properly classify it .    to be conservative",
    ", we prefer to rely on a classification that is based only on the morphology , which is an observable .",
    "therefore we divide relics in _ elongated _ and _ roundish _ , and obtain the properties of these two classes , to find out whether they may be indications of different origin and physical parameters . in all the following plots , as done in fig .",
    "[ fig : relz ] , we will use different symbols for the elongated and roundish relics .",
    "elongated relics are the classical extended objects , located in cluster peripheral regions , characterized by an elongated shape roughly perpendicular to the cluster center direction , as the relic 1253 + 275 in the coma cluster ( @xcite ; fig .",
    "[ fig : comarelic ] ) .",
    "they do not show any evident substructures , and in some case their transverse size is very small .",
    "when observed with high angular resolution , they show an asymmetric transverse profile , with a sharp edge usually on the side toward the cluster outer edge and the radio emission is usually highly polarized .",
    "a spectacular example , detected very recently , is represented by the northern relic in cizaj2242.8 + 5301 @xcite .",
    "this giant relic is very narrow and slightly curved following the cluster boundary .",
    "it is strongly polarized , with highly regular polarization vectors , and shows steep spectrum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sausage ] ) . to the south of the cluster , at about 2.8 mpc distance ,",
    "a second ( fainter ) relic structure is present .",
    "we note that projection effects may be important in these elongated structures .",
    "an extreme , and unique , case in the double cluster a115 @xcite , where the relic apparently starts at the center of the northern cluster and is elongated towards the cluster periphery ( fig .",
    "[ fig : relstructures ] , left panel ) .",
    "these morphologies are in very good agreement with models predicting that these sources are related to large - scale shocks generated during cluster merger events .",
    "indeed , these shocks expanding with high velocity ( mach number @xmath3 1 - 3 ) can accelerate electrons to high energies , and compress magnetic fields , giving rise to large regions emitting synchrotron radiation .",
    "the accelerated particles will have a power - law energy distribution , and magnetic fields aligned parallel to the shock front .",
    "this is also consistent with the observed spectral index ( see sect . [ sec:53 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : sausage ] , right panel ) and polarization properties , and explain the shape and location of these sources ( see e.g. @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "in addition to elongated relics , diffuse extended radio sources with a more regular and roundish structure have been detected off - center in clusters : an example is in a1664 @xcite , shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : relstructures ] . despite their different structure",
    ", these relics share with the elongated relics the location at the cluster periphery and the lack of an optical identification .",
    "the main properties of roundish relics are the diffuse morphology resolved in filamentary sub - structures and a very steep curved spectrum ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the detection of roundish relics might lead to the obvious interpretation that these sources would be elongated relics seen face - on .",
    "this is however very unlikely , indeed the number of relics with elongated shape is too high to be consistent with simple projection effects .",
    "moreover , we will show in the following and in the next subsections that the properties of elongated and roundish relics may be different .",
    "the class of roundish relics defined here includes the sources named radio phoenix by @xcite , or relic sources near the first ranked galaxy ( frg ) by @xcite .",
    "these objects are located near the central frg , usually a cd galaxy , but not coincident with it .",
    "their size is in a large range of values , i.e. from @xmath9 100 kpc ( as in a2063 and a4038 ) to @xmath3 350 kpc ( as in a85 ) .",
    "these sources , when observed at higher resolution , show evident filamentary substructures ( e.g. @xcite ) . owing to the proximity of these sources to an agn",
    ", an obvious interpretation is that these sources consist of old radio lobes originated by previous agn activity , which have become no longer visible because of strong radiation losses , and have been revived by the energy supplied by shock waves .",
    "a caveat to this interpretation is that these relics are always located only on one side with respect to the frg .",
    "we note , however , the case of a133 , which was classified in the past as a relic ( radio phoenix ) but has been recently shown to be an old radio galaxy @xcite",
    ". another possible explanation of the nature of these sources has been supplied by mathews & brighenti @xcite , who , in their study of the connection between x - ray cavities and radio lobes , suggest that radio bubbles , blown into the cluster gas by a radio galaxy will rise buoyantly and may eventually expand to the cluster outskirts , where the cosmic rays would impact into the surrounding medium , giving rise to small relics located near the agn .    among relics with a roundish shape , there are also some objects which are located at large distance from the frg or any bright galaxy , therefore difficult to reconcile with any model involving a previous radio activity : we already noted a1664 shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : relstructures ] ; another case is in a548b , where two roundish relics are present , on the same side of the cluster @xcite ( see fig . [",
    "fig : clcollection ] ) .",
    "more data are necessary to understand the origin and nature of these objects .",
    "interestingly , we note that roundish relics are peaked at lower redshift with respect to the total relic redshift distribution and that no roundish relics at z @xmath19 0.2 are known ( fig .",
    "[ fig : relz ] ) .      in the framework that relics are witnessing the presence of shock waves originated by mergers between clusters with approximately equal masses and low impact parameter",
    ", it is expected that relics should often come in pairs and be located on opposite sides of the cluster along the axis merger , with the extended radio structures elongated perpendicularly to this axis ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the first cluster where two almost symmetric relics have been detected to be located on opposite sides with respect to the cluster center is a3667 @xcite .",

    "@xcite discuss , from hydrodynamical simulations and comparison with the data , that the relic morphology arises naturally from shocks produced by a head - on merger in the plane of the sky of two roughly equal mass clusters . in the clusters a1240 and a2345 , optical data support the outgoing merger shocks models @xcite . in the case of a3376 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a3376 ] ) , bagchi and collaborators @xcite suggested the possibility that the two relics may be tracing shocks induced by the accretion flows of the intergalactic medium during the large - scale structure formation ( accretion shocks @xcite ) .",
    "this interpretation is under debate for this cluster ( e.g. @xcite ) , however it may be invoked to explain the origin of other sources as e.g. the outermost relics in a2255 @xcite and possibly the peripheral emission of the coma cluster @xcite .          as the coma cluster",

    "these structures are the most extreme examples of the connection between halo sources and cluster mergers ( see sect .",

    "indeed the merger that gives rise to the radio halo , could also be the origin of shock waves which supply the energy to the peripheral relics . in this scenario ,",
    "the origin of the bridge of radio emission connecting the halo to the relic source in some clusters has still to be clarified .",
    "we note that in most clusters showing at least a relic source , no central halo is present .",
    "this could suggest that relics could be created also by minor mergers , which are not strong enough to produce a radio halo at the cluster center .",
    "this is in agreement with the presence of relics in a few cool - core clusters , since a minor and off - center merger could create a peripheral shock wave , without destroying the central cool - core . as discussed by van weeren et al .",
    "@xcite , double relics should be located in merging systems with a small mass ratio , while single relics should be found in mergers with larger mass ratios .      to better understand the properties of relics , we derived correlations between their observational radio properties and their location in the cluster , using the data of the september2011-relic collection .",
    "double relics in the same clusters are included separately . in the plots , we use different symbols for the elongated and roundish relics , and find that in general elongated and roundish relics are rather separated , with the exception of a few sources .    in the left panel of fig .",

    "it can be deduced that projection effects are unlikely to play a crucial role , i.e. elongated relics are actually located in the cluster outskirts .",
    "this may be due to the fact that high mach number shocks needed to supply energy to the radio emitting particles are only present in cluster peripheral regions @xcite .",

    "alternatively , we could also consider possible selection effects : indeed small size relics which are marginally resolved may be often classified as background discrete radio galaxies .",
    "we can argue that the nature of roundish , ultra - steep relics is different from that of other relics , either elongated or roundish , and that the spectral index is likely a key parameter for the classification of relics .",
    "some relaxed , cool - core , galaxy clusters exhibit signs of diffuse synchrotron radio emission that extend far from the dominant radio galaxy at the cluster center , forming a so - called mini - halo .",
    "mini - halos are extended on a moderate scale ( @xmath67 500 kpc ) and in common with halos and relics they have a low surface brightness and a steep spectrum .",
    "the diffuse source in the ophiucus cluster @xcite , reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : ophiucus ] , is an example of a mini - halo .",
    "mini - halos are sometimes considered small versions of radio halos , but their classification is more complex and fuzzy .",
    "their emission originates from relativistic particles and magnetic fields which are believed to be deeply mixed with the thermal intracluster gas . as a general guideline",
    ", this physical characteristic can be used to distinguish mini - halos from other kind of steep spectrum radio sources in clusters such as radio bubbles related to agn activity .",
    "we shall not define as mini - halos those radio sources in which the ambient thermal gas is clearly separated by the non - thermal plasma , as in the case of agn radio lobes whose expansion has created cavities or holes in the intracluster x - ray emission .",
    "an example of this situation is given by the radio source 3c317 at the center of a2052 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "3c317 is composed of a compact core surrounded by an amorphous halo",
    ". this kind of radio morphology is also referred to as a _ core - halo _ ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although the radio emission at the center of a2052 resembles on a smaller scale the typical mini - halo , almost all of the radio emission detected so far is contained within cavities devoid of x - ray emitting gas .",
    "therefore , this type of radio sources will not be considered here .",
    "the perseus cluster is a different case .",
    "the radio source 3c84 at the center of perseus shows x - ray cavities in the inner region where the agn radio activity interacts with the thermal gas ( e.g. @xcite ) , but on larger scale the cluster exhibits a diffuse radio emission mixed with the thermal intracluster gas .",
    "indeed perseus cluster represents the prototype example of a mini - halo ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "when the cluster x - ray information is lacking , as for the diffuse emission found in the system mrc 0116 + 111 @xcite , the mini - halo classification can be particularly troublesome .",
    "in addition to the above mentioned difficulties in the mini - halo classification , the relatively small angular size of mini - halos in combination with a possibly strong emission of the central radio galaxy , complicates their detection .",
    "thus , our current observational knowledge on mini - halos is limited to a few clusters .",

    "other mini - halos candidates have been found in a1068 , and a1413 ( @xcite ) , although to be classified as mini - halos they would require further investigation .",
    "the spectra of mini - halos are steep , as well as for halos , with some evidence of radial spectral steepening ( e.g. perseus @xcite , a2626 @xcite , ophiucus @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of mini - halos is still poorly known .",
    "gitti et al .",
    "@xcite argued that the radio emitting particles in mini - halos can not be connected to the central radio galaxy in terms of particle diffusion .",
    "they proposed that mini - halos result from a relic population of relativistic electrons reaccelerated by mhd turbulence via fermi - like processes , the necessary energetics being supplied by the cool - core region .",
    "this is supported by the correlation observed between the mini - halo radio power and the cooling rate power @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the mini - halo present in the most x - ray luminous cluster rxj1347.5 - 1145 @xcite , suggests that additional energy for electron reacceleration in mini - halos might be provided by sub - cluster mergers that have not been able to destroy the central cluster cool core . in this cluster , the spatial correspondence between a radio excess of the mini - halo emission and a hot region , detected through both sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( see fig . [",
    "fig : minihalo ] ) and x - ray observations , indicates that electron reacceleration in this location is most likely related to a shock front propagating into the intra - cluster medium @xcite .",
    "in addition to rxj1347.5 - 1145 , other clusters of galaxies like ophiuchus @xcite and a2142 @xcite present a radio mini - halo , as well as a cool core that has likely survived a possible recent merging event . indeed , although cool - core clusters are generally considered relaxed systems , when analyzed in detail they sometimes reveal peculiar x - ray features in the cluster center which may be indicative of a link between the mini - halo emission and some minor merger activity .",
    "finally , cold fronts associated to the core gas sloshing have been observed in some clusters hosting a mini - halo .",
    "thus , the possibility has been advanced that gas sloshing may generate turbulence in the core , which in turn may reaccelerate the relativistic electrons necessary to form a mini - halo @xcite .",

    "most of what we know about intracluster magnetic fields derives from the study of cluster diffuse radio sources ( halos , relics and mini - halos ) and faraday rotation measures of polarized radio galaxies located inside or behind galaxy clusters .",
    "one of the first comprehensive reviews on extragalactic magnetic field was presented by kronberg @xcite , followed by more recent works @xcite .",
    "large - scale magnetic fields are studied through radio halos , which reveal magnetic fields spread over extremely large volumes .",
    "sometimes , the intracluster magnetic fields can be ordered on scales of hundreds of kpc , as revealed in a2255 @xcite , and macs j0717.5 + 3745 @xcite , where a polarized signal has been detected .",
    "the brightness fluctuations and polarization level of radio halos are strictly related to the intracluster magnetic field structure .",
    "for example , lack of polarization and a smooth and regular surface brightness may indicate that the cluster magnetic field is ordered on small scales , while a disturbed radio morphology and presence of polarization could be related to a magnetic field ordered on large scales @xcite .",
    "currently , only in the radio halos of a2255 and a665 , brightness fluctuations and polarization information have been used to put some constraints on the magnetic field power spectrum of a galaxy cluster @xcite .",
    "the most promising technique to derive a detailed view of the intracluster magnetic fields on small spatial scales is the analysis of the faraday rotation of radio galaxies located inside and beyond clusters .",
    "the faraday effect is the rotation suffered by linearly polarized radiation traveling through a magnetized plasma .",
    "the intrinsic polarization angle @xmath75 is rotated by an amount : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the radiation wavelength while @xmath78 is the so - called rotation measure .",

    "the rm distributions seen across these sources present patchy structures whose statistics is , in first approximation , gaussian - like with dispersions up to several hundred ( and even thousand ) rad / m@xmath85 .",

    "however , recent rm images @xcite of four radio galaxies ( 0206 + 35 , 3c270 , 3c353 , m84 ) located in environments ranging from poor groups to rich clusters show clearly anisotropic `` banded '' patterns . in some cases , these rm patterns coexist with regions of isotropic random variations .",

    "some of them present strong rm asymmetries between the two lobes .",
    "this is the laing - garrington effect : the farthest lobe suffers a higher faraday rotation due to the largest amount of intervening material @xcite . indeed , at least for these sources , we know that the observed rm must originate mostly in the foreground magnetized intracluster medium .",

    "another filamentary structure extending over 3.3 mpc is centered on the cd galaxy of the cluster a3444 @xcite .",
    "the large size of this radio feature , as well as its morphology , rule out a direct connection with the central galaxy and invite comparison with the filamentary structures found in zwcl2341.1 + 0000 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of large - scale radio emission in regions in between galaxy clusters , ( e.g. 0917 + 75 @xcite ) , and giant ring - like features ( e.g. a3376 @xcite ) seems to be related to the large - scale structure formation process , rather than to the cluster .",
    "we note also that diffuse bridges of radio emission connecting the halo to the relic have been observed in a few clusters , including coma @xcite and a2255 @xcite . in the coma cluster kronberg",
    "@xcite , confirmed by brown & rudnick @xcite , detected a radio cloud surrounding both the halo and the relic source .",
    "the radio cloud size corresponds to about 4 mpc if it is associated with the coma cluster , and is the most extensive complex of synchrotron emitting plasma yet seen in cosmic large - scale structure . in a2255 , in addition to the radio bridge , low brightness emission located far away from the cluster center has been detected @xcite .",
    "all the mentioned large - scale diffuse radio emissions might trace the process of a large - scale structure formation , where cosmic shocks that originated in complex merger events are able to amplify magnetic fields and accelerate synchrotron electrons along cluster filaments . in many cases",
    "the physical nature of these structures remains , however , ambiguous ; candidates include cosmological filaments , unevolved protoclusters in the process of formation , and or large - scale debris near rich , merging clusters .    in any case",
    ", all these data support the existence of an intergalactic magnetic field more widespread and somewhat lower than that in the intracluster medium within clusters .",
    "this field may represent the seed field for galaxies and clusters , and may play an important role in the formation of large - scale structure .",
    "these are important results since they allow expanding our knowledge of magnetic fields from clusters to filaments , and are a fundamental step to understanding the origin and properties of cosmological scale magnetic fields .",
    "we are moving from magnetic field structures up to 1 mpc scale to structures 3 - 5 times more extended .",
    "attempts to probe magnetic field strength on larger local - universe scales have also been done via faraday rotation studies @xcite .",
    "the measurement of extremely weak magnetic fields in the voids and large scale structure is a challenging task and up to now only upper bounds have been derived using various techniques .",
    "the tightest upper bounds come from the search for the faraday rotation of polarization of the radio emission from distant quasars ( e.g. @xcite ) , and from the effect of magnetic fields on the anisotropy of cosmic microwave background radiation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a recent approach , using the cascade emission from blazars has been found to be promising ( e.g. @xcite ) . the multi - tev gamma - ray flux from distant blazars",
    "is strongly attenuated by pair production of the infrared / optical extragalactic background light , initiating electromagnetic cascades in the intergalactic space , whose charged component is deflected by the extragalactic magnetic fields .",
    "observable effects of these cascades include the delayed `` echoes '' of multi - tev gamma ray flares or gamma - ray bursts and the appearance of extended emission around point - like gamma - ray sources . from fermi observations ,",
    "lower bounds are at levels of 10@xmath106 to 10@xmath107 g , depending on the assumptions .",
    "dolag et al .",
    "@xcite derive that these magnetic fields are likely to fill at least 60% of space , thus imposing constraints on the magnetic field origin : either the magnetic fields are produced by a volume filling process ( e.g. primordially ) or very efficient transport mechanisms must be present to distribute the locally generated magnetic fields into the space .",
    "the connection between extended diffuse radio sources and cluster evolution , in particular the link between merger processes and halos / relics on one hand , and the link between mini - halos and relaxed clusters on the other hand , is well established as reported in this review .",
    "major cluster mergers can supply energy to the radio emitting particles , as well as amplify magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the magnetic field strength can grow during the process of cluster formation , from initial fields of the order of 10@xmath108 g at z = 15 to final fields of the order of @xmath8 g at z = 0 .",
    "this magnetic field amplification is spread over the entire history of cluster formation , and related to the various merger processes , therefore it is not expected to directly affect the formation of diffuse radio sources .    since magnetic fields",
    "have been found to be ubiquitous in galaxy clusters ( see sect . [ sec:74 ] ) , the crucial ingredient for the existence of diffuse synchrotron radio sources is the presence of relativistic particles .",
    "radio halos are most difficult to explain , because of their very large size .",
    "radiating electrons can not travel such large distances within their lifetime , because of strong radiative losses by synchrotron and inverse compton emission .",
    "two main classes of models have been suggested for the origin of relativistic electrons present in the cluster volume and responsible for the diffuse radio emission : the _ primary electron _ model which predict that relativistic particles are continuously accelerated in the cluster volume , and the _ hadronic ( secondary electrons ) _ model , in which relativistic electrons are produced through the cluster volume by pp collisions .",
    "we introduce here these models and summarize their expectations , to draw a picture of the formation scenario of diffuse radio sources . for a detailed analysis of the theoretical studies on this topic we refer to recent papers ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "primary relativistic electrons are present in the cluster volume , because they were injected by agn activity ( quasars , radio galaxies , etc . ) , or by star formation in normal galaxies ( supernovae , galactic winds , etc . ) during the cluster dynamical history ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "this population of electrons suffers strong radiation losses mainly because of synchrotron and inverse compton emission , thus reacceleration is needed to maintain their energy to the level necessary to produce the observed synchrotron radio emission in relatively weak magnetic fields ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the possibility that electrons are accelerated from the sub - relativistic electrons has also been considered in the literature ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .    for the above reasons , primary electron models",
    "can also be referred to as reacceleration models .",
    "there are two main ways that entail the transfer of energy from the cluster icm to the radiating particles : these are cluster turbulence and cluster shocks .",
    "simulations show that during cluster mergers , turbulence is generated throughout the cluster over @xmath3 mpc scales .",
    "energy can thus be transferred from the icm into the non - thermal component through resonant or non - resonant interaction of electrons with mhd turbulence ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the emerging scenario is that turbulence reacceleration is likely the major mechanism responsible for the supply of energy to the electrons radiating in radio halos .",
    "turbulent acceleration is like a second - order fermi process , i.e. related with a random processes , and consequently not quite efficient .",
    "the time during which the process is effective is relatively short ( a few 10@xmath32 years ) , so that the radio emission is expected to correlate with ongoing or most recent merger events ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these models predict that reaccelerated electrons will have a maximum energy ( @xmath109 10@xmath110 ) which produces a high frequency cut - off in the resulting synchrotron spectrum @xcite .",
    "thus a high frequency steepening of the integrated spectrum is expected , as well as a radial steepening and/or a complex spatial distribution of the spectral index between two frequencies , the latter due to different reacceleration processes in different cluster regions . the evidence of the presence of faint diffuse magnetic fields in all galaxy clusters ( see sect . [ sec:74 ] ) , the behaviour of radio spectra ( see sect . [ sec:41 ] ) , the existence of ultra - steep radio halos ( sect .",
    "[ sec:413 ] ) , the correlation between radio spectra and temperature ( sect .",
    "[ sec:412 ] ) , the association between radio halos and cluster mergers ( sect .",
    "[ sec:432 ] ) , and the fact that halos are not common in galaxy clusters @xcite , are supportive of primary electron models for radio halos . the radio power - x - ray luminosity correlation ( sect .",
    "[ sec:43 ] ) is easily reproduced by reacceleration models ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in mini - halos ,",
    "the mhd turbulence associated with the cool - core region has been also suggested to be responsible for reacceleration of radiating particles @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the spectral properties and the observed correlation between the mini - halo radio power and the cooling rate power @xcite .",
    "another possibility , recently suggested by mazzotta & giacintucci @xcite and zuhone et al .",
    "@xcite , is that turbulence in cool - core clusters could arise from the sloshing motions of the cluster core gas .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the detection of spiral - shaped cold - fronts in the x - ray emission of cool - core clusters , suggested to be the signature of gas sloshing ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "shock acceleration is a first - order fermi process of great importance in radio astronomy , as it is recognized as the mechanism responsible for particle acceleration in supernova remnants .",
    "the acceleration occurs diffusively , in that particles scatter back and forth across the shock , gaining at each crossing and recrossing an amount of energy proportional to the energy itself .",
    "the acceleration efficiency is mostly determined by the shock mach number .",
    "current observations globally favour the scenario that cluster shocks are strictly linked to relics @xcite ) .",
    "the production of outgoing shock waves at the cluster periphery with mach number @xmath3 2 - 3 is indeed observed in numerical simulations of cluster merger events and more generally in the large - scale structure formation @xcite .",
    "accelerated electrons have been suggested either to be thermal icm electrons @xcite , or relativistic electrons released by a former active radio galaxy @xcite .",
    "because of the short electron radiative lifetimes , radio emission is produced close to the location of the shock waves .",
    "these models also predict that the magnetic field within the relic is aligned with the shock front , and that the radio spectrum is flatter at the shock edge , where the radio brightness is expected to decline sharply .",
    "these expectations are consistent with the classic elongated structure of relics , almost perpendicular to the merger axis , and their polarization properties .",
    "vazza et al .",
    "@xcite show that the detection frequency of radio relics and the fact that they are also detected in cluster peripheries is consistent with their link to shocks .",
    "the detection of shocks in the cluster outskirts is difficult with current instruments , because of the very low gas density and thus x - ray brightness in these regions ( for a recent review see @xcite ) . in the coma cluster , feretti & neumann @xcite , analyzing newton - xmm data ,",
    "did not detect the temperature jump implied by the presence of a shock at the relic location , although the brightness trend may be consistent with the shock .",
    "solovyeva et al .",
    "@xcite presented evidence of a shock at the location of the relics in a548b . a weak shock has been detected by macario et al .",
    "@xcite in a754 .",
    "recently , shocks have been detected with suzaku in a3376 @xcite and a3667 @xcite .",
    "it can not be excluded that shock acceleration may also be efficient in some particular regions of a halo ( e.g. @xcite ) , however , the radio emission of halos can be very extended up to large scales , thus it is hardly associated with localized shocks .",
    "moreover , some clusters exhibit a spatial correlation between the radio halo emission and the hot gas regions @xcite , however , this is not a general feature , and in some cases the hottest gas regions do not exhibit radio emission .      in the hadronic model ,",
    "secondary electrons are injected as secondary particles by inelastic nuclear collisions between the relativistic protons and the nuclei of the thermal ambient intracluster medium ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the protons diffuse on large scale because their energy losses are negligible .",
    "they can continuously produce _ in situ _ electrons , distributed through the cluster volume .",
    "the possibility that the high - energy electrons , responsible for the synchrotron emission , arise from the decay of secondary products of the neutralino annihilation in the dark matter halos of galaxy clusters has also been suggested @xcite .",
    "secondary electron models have been proposed for the emission of radio halos ( see e.g. @xcite ) and of mini - halos @xcite .",
    "they can not work for relics , since peripheral cluster regions do not host a sufficiently dense thermal proton population required as targets for the efficient production of secondary electrons .",
    "secondary electron models can reproduce the basic properties of the radio halos provided that the strength of the magnetic field averaged over the emitting volume is larger than a few @xmath8 g . in this case , they predict synchrotron power - law spectra , which are independent of cluster location , i.e. do not show any features and/or radial steepening , and the spectral index values are flatter than @xmath28 @xmath3 1.5 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the profiles of the radio emission should be steeper than those of the x - ray gas ( e.g. @xcite ) . since the radio emitting electrons originate from protons accumulated during the cluster formation history , no correlation to recent mergers",
    "is expected , but halos should be present in virtually all clusters .",
    "moreover , emission of gamma - rays and of neutrinos is predicted .",
    "recently , a universal linear correlation between radio and x - ray surface brightness in halos and mini - halos was found @xcite , assuming secondary electron models and a relatively strong magnetized igm ( @xmath19 3 @xmath8 g ) .",
    "this model reproduces the observed radio spectral steepening , but requires a very high central magnetic field ( @xmath19 10 @xmath8 g ) .",
    "the intracluster medium is a complex mixture of thermal and non - thermal protons and electrons .",
    "it has been suggested in that halos could arise from both primary and secondary electrons .",
    "relativistic protons are an important component of relativistic icm particles , and they are an important origin of relativistic electrons .",
    "mhd turbulence can reaccelerate both primary and secondary particles , producing radio emission in agreement with observational results ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the relative contribution of these two components is constrained by the observational properties .",
    "constraints on the energy budget of the various components have been derived by brunetti & blasi @xcite and more recently by brunetti & lazarian @xcite .",
    "these authors discuss also that secondary electrons could give rise to mpc scale halos characterized by very low surface brightness and radio power , not yet observed because of observational limits of present radio telescopes , but which should be detected by the incoming new radio telescopes .",
    "the collisions producing secondary electrons also lead to gamma - ray emission through the production and subsequent decays of neutral pions .",
    "the implications of gamma - ray detections from galaxy clusters are largely discussed in literature ( see e.g. blasi et al . @xcite and references therein ) . however ,",
    "diffuse gamma - ray emission has not yet been detected from galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "these non detections constrain the possible energy density in cosmic - ray protons and , therefore , the density of relativistic electrons that may be produced from these .",
    "the fermi - lat gamma - ray space telescope greatly improved the sensitivity of observations at mev / gev energies and reported gamma - ray upper limits for a large sample of clusters @xcite .",
    "jeltema & profumo @xcite examined the secondary electron models for the origin of halos in the light of these new fermi results .",
    "the non detection of gamma - ray emission from clusters puts constraints to the possible density of secondary relativistic electrons and imply a minimum magnetic field strength to reproduce the observed emission from radio halos . for clusters such as a1914 and a2256 , average magnetic fields at least of the order of several @xmath8gauss",
    "are needed to avoid an overproduction of gamma - rays , not seen by fermi @xcite .",
    "the implied magnetic fields in hadronic models are in excess of , or close to , the largest cluster magnetic field values obtained with faraday rotation measures ( see sect .",
    "[ sec:7 ] ) .",
    "this seems problematic for the hadronic origin of radio halos .",
    "however , at present , due to the uncertainties , secondary electron models are not ruled out by fermi gamma - ray data even if required magnetic fields are in some clusters higher than values obtained with other observations .",
    "this result show the importance of high energy data in understanding non - thermal emission in galaxy clusters .",
    "our knowledge of non - thermal phenomena in galaxy clusters has significantly improved in the past years , owing to good and deep observations and advanced modeling .",
    "nevertheless , new observations will be necessary to solve the outstanding issues faced in determining what is the dominating mechanism in the formation and maintenance of the diffuse radio emission , in particular : 1 ) search for new sources of the different classes , in particular at low powers and at large redshifts , to improve the information on the statistical properties of cluster diffuse sources ; 2 ) obtain polarization information on halos , and perform rotation measure studies of embedded and background radio sources , to get a detailed knowledge of the magnetic field strength , structure , and degree of ordering ; 3 ) derive accurate integrated spectra on a large frequency range and detailed spectral index distributions at high resolution .      owing to the new capabilities of the evla , in particular sensitivity , frequency agility , and spectral capability , it will be possible to detect faint radio emission and trace the magnetic fields in galaxy clusters .",
    "the new radio telescope lofar will explore the universe at low frequencies , as shown e.g. by the first results on the cluster a2256 @xcite .",
    "as diffuse cluster radio sources are bright at low frequency , lofar will be able to detect thousands of such sources up to the epoch of cluster formation , in particular halos and relics with ultra - steep spectra , which are missed at cm frequencies",
    ". this will allow the investigation of the occurrence of diffuse cluster radio sources .",
    "their properties will be derived as a function of cluster properties up to the epoch at which the first massive clusters assembled ( z @xmath3 1 ) , testing predictions that cluster merging is rampant at high redshift .",
    "the detection of synchrotron radiation at the lowest possible levels will allow the measurement of magnetic fields in clusters and in even more rarefied regions of the intergalactic space , and the investigation of the relation between the formation of magnetic fields and the formation of the large - scale structure in the universe .",
    "with lofar , owing to the long wavelengths involved , it will also be possible to obtain faraday rotation down to 0.1 - 1 rad m@xmath111 , which are very difficult to measure with the current instruments at cm wavelengths .",
    "the detection of very low rotation measures implies in turn the detection of very faint magnetic fields therefore lofar will become the radio telescope to measure the weakest cosmic magnetic fields so far .",
    "two projects planned with the australian square kilometre array pathfinder ( askap ) , i.e. the deep radio sky survey project emu ( evolutionary map of the universe ) and the polarization survey possum ( polarisation sky survey of the universe s magnetism ) will allow the detection of diffuse radio sources and the improvement of faraday rotation information in clusters and in the overall intergalactic medium . the first science with the meerkat array in south africa region , in particular the mightee ( meerkat international gigahertz tiered extragalactic exploration survey ) project will cover a wide range of astrophysics , including non - thermal phenomena in clusters .    apertif phased arrays that are being installed in wsrt will dramatically increase the survey speed for wsrt .",
    "this will enable the wodan ( westerbork observations of the deep apertif northern - sky ) project , a survey complementary to emu .",
    "the most innovative studies will be performed with ska : they are summarized in  science with the square kilometre array ",
    "@xcite ( for cluster and intergalactic medium studies see e.g. @xcite ) . recently ,",
    "krause et al .",
    "@xcite investigate the potential of the square kilometer array ( ska ) for measuring the magnetic fields in clusters of galaxies via faraday rotation of background polarized sources .",
    "they derive the distribution of rm due to clusters , by using an average gas density distribution and adopting models for the population of cluster radio sources , for the cluster mass distribution , and for the source polarization .",
    "they calculate the statistics for background rm measurements in clusters at different redshift and different ska exposures , arrays and completion levels in the mid frequency range .",
    "they conclude that the full ska will be able to make very detailed magnetic field structure measurements of clusters with more than 100 background sources in clusters up to z = 0.5 , and more than 1000 background radio sources in nearby clusters .",
    "bogdanovic et al .",
    "@xcite analyze different physical mechanisms operating in the icm , i.e. conduction - driven mhd instabilities and turbulence - dominated instabilities , and derive that these deeply affect the structure of the cluster magnetic field producing different field topologies .",
    "they evaluate the effects of the two mechanisms on the faraday rm of background radio sources and conclude that future spectropolarimetrimetric measurements with evla and ska will have sufficient sensitivity to discriminate between them .",
    "observations in the radio domain will need to be complemented by data at all other wavelenghts , in particular optical , x - ray and gamma - ray , to establish the cluster conditions , the merger evolutionary stage , the presence and properties of shocks , the signatures of cluster turbulence , and to derive firm correlations on large samples and over a large range of parameters between radio properties and cluster parameters .",
    "finally , the study of the non - thermal inverse compton emission in the hard x - ray and extreme ultraviolet domains needs to be pursued on several clusters , with and without diffuse emission , to get independent information on the existence of relativistic particles .",
