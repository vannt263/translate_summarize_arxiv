    "for the investigation of many - particle systems at finite temperatures the free energy @xmath2 plays a central role .",
    "one basic property of the free energy is its size consistency , i.e. the free energy scales with the size of the system .",
    "each approximation which is used to evaluate @xmath2 must preserve this property .",
    "in diagrammatic approaches size consistency is guaranteed by the fact that in any physical quantity only linked diagrams enter .",
    "usually , diagram technique makes use of wick s theorem , which is appropriate only if the unperturbed hamiltonian is a single - particle hamiltonian .",
    "therefore standard diagrammatic approaches are restricted to weakly correlated systems . an alternative approach to evaluate statical and dynamical properties at zero temperature was recently proposed @xcite and is based on the introduction of cumulants . as is well known from statistical physics",
    "the use of cumulants ensures size consistency .",
    "this favors the cumulant method especially for the description of strongly correlated systems though it may be applied as well to weakly correlated systems .",
    "the main aspect of the present paper is to investigate excitation energies which are needed to evaluate the free energy .",
    "there is a natural danger that a cumulant expansion of @xmath2 is only valid for high temperatures . expanding with respect to small values of the inverse temperature @xmath3",
    "the partition function reads @xmath4 where @xmath5 stands for an unweighted average at infinite temperature and @xmath6 is the trace of the unity operator @xmath7 .",
    "expanding @xmath8 , suitably regrouped into contributions in powers of @xmath9 , one finds for the free energy @xmath10                    \\\\          & & + \\frac{\\beta^2}{3!}\\left[\\langle h^{3 } \\rangle_{0}-               3 \\langle h^{2 } \\rangle_{0 } \\langle h \\rangle_{0}+               2 \\langle h^{3 } \\rangle_{0 } \\right ]                + \\cdots\\,\\,\\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the expressions in the brackets @xmath11 $ ] are cumulants .    in the present approach",
    "we want to avoid that a free energy expansion like ( [ 2 ] ) is only valid for high temperatures . of more interest",
    "are low - temperature expansions . a low - temperature expansion for @xmath2 must reduce to the ground - state energy in the limit @xmath12 .",
    "in contrast to a high - temperature expansion where @xmath9 is small , for sufficiently low temperatures the canonical weight @xmath13 is small for excitations @xmath14 higher than the ground - state energy @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , in case of a non - degenerate ground state the free energy can be expanded for low temperatures as follows @xmath16 a neglection of high - lying excitations is not always allowed .",
    "for instance , for the one - dimensional ising model in a longitudinal field the thermodynamic limit and the limit @xmath17 do not commute .",
    "this is an alternative description of the fact that long - range order is destroyed in one dimension .    in this paper",
    "we propose a cumulant formalism for the calculation of excitation energies of correlated electronic systems .",
    "this method is based on a perturbational approach , i.e. , the hamiltonian is splitted into @xmath18 and @xmath19 with @xmath18 being exactly solvable .",
    "one starts from eigenstates of @xmath18 and includes the effect of @xmath19 by an exponential ansatz .",
    "especially for the zero - temperature version of the method this can be shown to be equivalent to summing a perturbation series to infinite order .",
    "so the present method is well suited for systems which can in principle be treated perturbatively , but it can not account for systems with very large fluctuations , e.g. , most one - dimensional spin models .    this paper is organized as follows . in the sec .",
    "ii we shortly review the size - consistent ground - state version of the cumulant method . in sec .",
    "iii the cumulant method for the computation of excitation energies is presented . with this general scheme",
    "we are able to calculate partition functions . to demonstrate the applicability of the method we investigate the @xmath0-@xmath1 model at weak doping as a topic of current interest .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional model with anisotropic magnetic exchange and calculate the staggered magnetization within the antiferromagnetic phase in dependence on temperature and hole concentration . a discussion and concluding remarks are put in the last section .",
    "for a better understanding of the cumulant method its ground - state version is briefly reviewed . for more details see@xcite .",
    "the method starts from the definition of the function @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the rigorously solvable unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath18 with the ground state @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath23 .",
    "the aim is to calculate the ground - state energy @xmath15 of the full system , @xmath24 .",

    "is transformed into @xmath30 next , we define the laplace transform of the function @xmath31 by : @xmath32 one can show@xcite that the energy shift @xmath33 with respect to the unperturbed ground - state energy @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 on the other side , equation ( [ 5 ] ) is used to express @xmath33 in terms of cumulants @xmath36 here @xmath37 denotes cumulant expection values with respect to the unperturbed ground state @xmath22 .",

    "this is usually fulfilled if @xmath18 is the dominant part of the hamiltonian .",

    "other interesting examples may be found in refs .",
    "if the full ground state @xmath44 is expected to break a symmetry of @xmath45 then @xmath18 has to be chosen so that its ground state @xmath22 breaks this symmetry , too .",
    "instead of using the explicit form ( [ 10 ] ) of the wave operator @xmath41 an exponential ansatz was proposed @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a set of relevant operators .",
    "they have to be chosen in such a way that @xmath50 ( with appropriate parameters @xmath51 ) represents a good approximation of the exact ground state .",
    "the yet unknown parameters @xmath52 are to be determined from the following set of equations @xmath53 these equations follow from the condition of @xmath54 being an eigenstate of @xmath45 .",
    "note that equations ( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 13 ] ) allow for the computation of the ground - state energy .",
    "for algebraic reasons it is suitable to use operators @xmath55 which only create ( but do not destroy ) fluctuations with respect to the unperturbed ground state @xmath22 .",
    "then the expansion of the exponential in ( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 13 ] ) stops after a few terms because the hamiltonian @xmath45 and the adjoint fluctuation operators @xmath56 have to remove all fluctuations which are created by @xmath41 and @xmath19 in the state @xmath22 .",
    "the choice of appropriate operators @xmath57 is most important for actual calculations using the cumulant method .",

    "this might be only of little help especially if the main physical effect comes from higher powers of @xmath19 .",
    "in such a case a small set of few relevant operators leads to a far simpler description of the main effect than including a large set of powers @xmath58 .",
    "the selection of relevant operators for the cumulant method can be seen similar to the selection of dynamical variables for mori - zwanzig projection technique : formally , variables can be systematically derived from the liouvillian , but often choosing variables from physical insight is more useful .    for a discussion of the cumulant method and its relation to other methods like variational calculations and the coupled - cluster method see appendix c. in the past",

    "the path coefficients @xmath196 should depend on the hole momenta in ( [ gsdef4 ] ) and on the spin - wave excitations . as discussed above , we expect this dependence to be weak .",
    "it is neglected within our rigid - band approximation which fixes the values of the @xmath196 to those known from the ground - state calculation @xcite .    with the ansatz ( [ utj1 ] ) we can now calculate the coefficients @xmath150 for all distributions of hole momenta . in analogy to the undoped case we use the equation @xmath197 which is provided by the cumulant method .",
    "the expectation values are calculated to first order in @xmath110 using linear spin - wave theory , for details see@xcite .",
    "having found the values for the coefficients @xmath150 ( the @xmath196 are fixed by the rigid - band approximation for the hole quasiparticles ) we can calculate the energies of the system states .",
    "these are described by the set of hole momenta @xmath169 and the numbers of spin - wave excitations @xmath147 .",
    "the energies are calculated in analogy to appendix d , they can be written as @xmath198 the renormalized spin - wave energies @xmath199 depend on the number of holes @xmath164 , their momenta and spins @xmath169 , and the external field @xmath163 .",
    "explicitly they are given by@xcite @xmath200 with the substitutions @xmath201 , @xmath202 and @xmath203 in the second step of ( [ omegares3 ] ) we have inserted the solution for @xmath155 obtained from eq .",
    "( [ dop_quadgl ] ) . due to the approximation of independent holes the expectation values with @xmath22 in ( [ e_dottj_ex],[omegares3 ] ) factorize into contributions from each of the holes .",
    "so the cumulant expectation values in ( [ fterms ] ) have to be taken with one - hole states @xmath204 defined by @xmath205 the sum over @xmath82 runs over all holes in the system . the expression ( [ omegares3 ] )",
    "includes all terms up to first order in the hole concentration @xmath110 , i.e. , hole - hole interactions are neglected .    to calculate the magnetization of the system according to ( [ mag_fdiff ] ) we have to sum up the contributions from all states .",
    "the partition function is given by @xmath206 in the partition function we can exactly sum the contributions from the excited spin waves which are bosons .",
    "note that the spin - wave excitations do not affect the hole part because of our rigid - band approximation .",
    "thus we can define a probability @xmath207 for one - hole momentum distribution @xmath169 : @xmath208 where we have used @xmath209    finally , one obtains the following expression for the staggered magnetization ( [ mag_fdiff ] ) : @xmath210 where @xmath211 is the contribution of the hole quasiparticles to the decrease of the magnetization . within the rigid - band approximation",
    "it is independent of the temperature .",
    "it is determined by the size of the quasiparticles ( spin bags ) and can be expressed by the hole concentration @xmath110 and the path coefficients @xmath196 of our ansatz ( [ utj1 ] ) : @xmath212    the last term in ( [ magtj_res ] ) contributing to the magnetization is calculated numerically .",
    "the integral over the spin - wave momenta has to be treated carefully for small @xmath143 .",
    "for an isotropic system ( @xmath213 ) and finite temperature it diverges logarithmically indicating an instability of the magnetic order in accordance with mermin - wagner theorem@xcite .",
    "the sum over the hole configurations @xmath214 has been calculated for a finite lattice . the contributions from states with hole excitations , i.e. , states with a hole momentum distribution different from the ground state , are rather small for the low temperatures considered here .    in fig",
    "1 we show the staggered magnetization calculated from ( [ magtj_res ] ) for @xmath215 and an anisotropy @xmath216 in dependence on temperature and hole concentration . at @xmath186 and @xmath185",
    "it has a value of about 61% of its saturation value which is of course identical with the result obtained in linear spin - wave theory .",
    "the small anisotropy does not have an essential influence on this value .",
    "for increasing temperature and/or increasing doping level the magnetization decreases and reaches zero at a line in the @xmath217-plane . this line shown in fig .",
    "3 can be interpreted as the boundary of the antiferromagnetic phase where we expect a second - order phase transition to a paramagnetic phase .",
    "note that linear spin - wave approximation becomes questionable for vanishing sublattice magnetization .",
    "therefore , the results presented here are reasonable in the region of small doping and low temperature , but the actual calculation can not provide a reliable description of the system in the vicinity of the magnetic phase transition ( @xmath218 ) and beyond it .",
    "our starting point was the nel state , and spin fluctuations are included by a perturbational method based on cumulants , but we always describe a system with antiferromagnetic long - range order@xcite .",
    "the behavior of the zero - temperature magnetization is shown in fig . 2 for @xmath213 , for a discussion see @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work was to present a method for calculating thermodynamic properties in correlated electronic systems .",
    "this method is based on the introduction of cumulants and is an extension of a cumulant approach for ground - state calculations which has been applied in the past to a wide range of strongly correlated systems .    after a short review of the ground - state version we have developed the extension of the cumulant method for the calculation of excitation energies .",
    "it is based on the introduction of an unitary operator @xmath61 transforming the set of unperturbed eigenstates of @xmath18 into the full eigenstates of @xmath45 . for the unitary operator we use an appropriate exponential ansatz .",
    "having calculated the spectrum of excitation energies we obtain the free energy and other thermodynamical quantities .",
    "the method is especially appropriate for low - temperature expansions if one has to take into account only low - lying excitations of the considered system .    in the second part of this paper",
    "we have applied our method to the weakly doped @xmath0-@xmath1 model with an anisotropic exchange at finite temperature .",
    "based on the investigation of the renormalization of the spin - wave spectrum by mobile holes @xcite we have calculated the staggered magnetization as function of doping , temperature and magnetic anisotropy .",
    "these calculations are only valid within the antiferromagnetic phase of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model at small doping concentrations and low temperatures because of the use of linear spin - wave approximation .",
    "possible improvements could include magnon - magnon interaction , i.e. nonlinear spin - wave theory , which leads to a temperature - dependent spin - wave spectrum .",
    "summarizing , we have developed a general formalism for the investigation of thermodynamic properties in both weakly and strongly correlated many - body systems .",
    "it was proposed by kladko@xcite to define cumulant expectation values with different bra and ket vectors .",
    "they are defined in analogy to ( [ cum_def ] ) by @xmath219 the vectors @xmath104 and @xmath39 must have a non - zero overlap , @xmath220 .",
    "it is easy to show that the cumulant equations ( [ 11],[13 ] ) and ( [ 15],[16 ] ) are also valid with a bra vector @xmath104 different from @xmath62 , e.g. @xmath221 with @xmath222 .",
    "these equations follow from the fact that @xmath61 transforms the unperturbed state @xmath62 into an eigenstate of the full hamiltonian @xmath45 .",
    "in this appendix we show how to evaluate cumulants containing an exponential ansatz for the wave operator @xmath41 or the unitary operator @xmath61 .",
    "the basic relation written with generalized cumulants is @xmath223 with @xmath38 and s being arbitrary operators and @xmath220 .",
    "note that on the l.h.s .",
    "the operators @xmath80 and @xmath38 are subject to cumulant ordering whereas on the r.h.s .",
    "only the @xmath38 operators are cumulant entities . however , the cumulants on the r.h.s .",
    "are formed with the new ket vector @xmath224 .",
    "( [ kumrel1 ] ) can be proved either by integrating infinitesimal transformations @xmath78 and using properties of cumulants@xcite or by explicit use of the definition of cumulant expectation values . here",
    "we demonstrate the second way .",
    "starting from the definition of generalized cumulant expectation values ( [ gencum_def ] ) for a product of arbitrary operators @xmath38 and arbitrary states @xmath104 , @xmath39 with @xmath220 we consider the following expression : @xmath225_{\\xi=0 \\atop \\lambda_i=0\\,\\forall\\,i}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last expression can be interpreted as a series expansion with respect to @xmath226 around 0 of the term in the brackets @xmath227 $ ] : @xmath228 in the last equation we have reintroduced generalized cumulants , now formed with the bra state @xmath229 and the ket state @xmath230 . with @xmath231 we obtain the desired result ( [ kumrel1 ] ) .",
    "explicitly we find from ( [ kumrel1 ] ) : @xmath232 and so on .",
    "for practical calculations the zero - temperature cumulant method together with the exponential ansatz for the wave operator @xmath41 consists of selecting an appropriate set of operators @xmath57 , i.e. , writing down an ansatz for the ground - state wavefunction .",
    "then the coefficients @xmath233 are determined using the equations ( [ 13 ] ) .",
    "the main advantage of this procedure compared to other methods is that the exponential term occurs only once in all equations .    in a standard variational calculation",
    "one uses an ansatz for the wavefunction and minimizes the ground - state energy by variation of the coefficients .",
    "in such a calculation the ansatz wavefunction ( including the exponential operator ) usually occurs four times , @xmath234 .",
    "furthermore , a wavefunction with an exponential ansatz usually can not be normalized .",
    "so both numerator and denominator of the energy expression might diverge with an exponential of the system size whereas their ratio should be proportional to the system size .",
    "the physical difference between both methods is the following : in a variational calculation the aim is minimizing the total energy of the system whereas in the cumulant method the aim is finding an eigenstate of @xmath45 . ( note that eq . ( [ 13 ] ) is exactly the condition of @xmath235 being an eigenstate of @xmath45 . )",
    "there is a close relationship of the equations ( [ 11],[12],[13 ] ) to the so - called coupled cluster method .",
    "this approach which was originally invented for studies in nuclear physics is also size consistent and does not involve wick s theorem . for a review see bishop@xcite .",
    "recently it was shown@xcite that the coupled - cluster method can be derived from the cumulant expressions ( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 13 ] ) .",
    "comparing practical calculations the cumulant method with an exponential ansatz is again easier to handle than the coupled - cluster scheme because the exponential term occurs only once in the cumulant equations and twice in the coupled - cluster equations .",
    "usually these different methods lead to different ( approximate ) results when calculating ground - state quantities .",
    "however , if the ansatz for the ground - state wavefunction covers the exact ground state , i.e. , if the subspace spanned by the operators @xmath57 contains the exact ground - state wavefunction , then of course all methods lead to the same exact result . in the following we",
    "briefly show how to derive coupled - cluster and variational equations from the cumulant method if one assumes that the exact ground state has the form @xmath236 with @xmath237 .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) also holds for arbitrary composite operators , e.g. , @xmath238 for arbitrary operators @xmath29 and @xmath239 . inserting ( [ 13 ] ) into ( [ 11 ] ) one obtains @xmath240 evaluating the cumulants in analogy to appendix b leads to @xmath241 these are the energy expressions for the coupled - cluster and the variational scheme , respectively .",
    "the equations for the coefficients are obtained from ( [ 13 ] ) as follows : @xmath242 transforming again the cumulants and using @xmath243 one finds @xmath244 and @xmath245 these two conditions are the equations for the coefficients @xmath233 within the coupled - cluster and the variational method .",
    "the second step of ( [ var_coeffeq ] ) includes evaluating the new cumulants with @xmath44 yielding exactly the four terms arising from the differentiation of the energy expression @xmath246 with respect to @xmath233 .",
    "we want to note here that the wave operator ( [ 10 ] ) of the cumulant approach is not limited to an exponential form ( as is the case e.g. in coupled - cluster calculations ) .",
    "so the cumulant method appears to be the more general and powerful scheme for the calculation of ground - state properties . for modified applications of the cumulant approach see e.g.@xcite .",
    "in this appendix we consider the bogoliubov transformation which diagonalizes the heisenberg antiferromagnet within linear spin - wave theory .",
    "we want to prove the equivalence of the forms of @xmath149 given in ( [ uheis1 ] ) and ( [ uheis2 ] ) .",
    "we have to prove @xmath247 where we used the short - hand notations @xmath248 and @xmath249 for the boson operators @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "note that the left - hand side of ( [ bogolid2 ] ) is the unitary transformation @xmath149 ( for fixed momentum @xmath143 ) transforming the `` original '' bosons @xmath248 and @xmath249 into the `` new '' bosons @xmath250 and @xmath9 , @xmath251 these relations can be easily checked by expanding both sides with respect to @xmath252 . with this",
    "we obtain @xmath253 another commutation relation needed is @xmath254 which can be derived from a well - known identity of kubo@xcite for arbitrary operators @xmath29 and @xmath45 : @xmath255\\quad=\\quad - \\int_0^\\lambda d u \\,\\,e^{-(\\lambda - u)h}\\ , [ a , h]\\ , e^{-uh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now we can prove ( [ bogolid2 ] ) .",
    "we first multiply ( [ bogolid2 ] ) by @xmath256 from the right in order to define the two functions @xmath257 the next step is to compare the equations of motion of @xmath258 and @xmath259 with respect to @xmath252 .",
    "one immediately finds @xmath260 now we insert ( [ bogolid3 ] ) and ( [ bogolid4 ] ) into ( [ bogolid5 ] ) leading to : @xmath261 using @xmath262 we see that both expressions are indeed identical . having shown that @xmath263 and @xmath264 obey the same equation of motion and the same initial condition @xmath265 we have proved eq .",
    "( [ bogolid2 ] ) .",
    "here we demonstrate the evaluation of the energy expression ( [ e_n_heis ] ) . for the denominator we find by use of ( [ uheis2 ] ) : @xmath266 for the numerator of ( [ e_n_heis ] )",
    "one obtains @xmath267 and @xmath268 after straightforward algebra we find from ( [ heisapp3 ] ) : @xmath269 collecting all terms leads directly to ( [ eheis2 ] ) .",
