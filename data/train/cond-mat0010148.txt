    "<S> the axial next  nearest neighbour ising ( annni ) model is studied for thin films of up to @xmath0 layers , with a distinct phase diagram for each film thickness . </S>",
    "<S> the systematics of the ordered phases , as obtained from mean  field theory , monte carlo simulations , and low temperature expansions , is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> results are compared to those for the annni model in the limit @xmath1 .    in recent years magnetism in thin films of a few atomic layers has attracted much interest @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , studies on the influence of the layer thickness , @xmath2 , on spatially modulated magnetic structures seem to be very scarce @xcite .    in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we shall deal with this aspect by analysing phase diagrams of the axial next  </S>",
    "<S> nearest neighbour ising ( annni ) model @xcite on a simple cubic lattice ( setting the lattice constant equal to one ) consisting of rather few , but large layers . the competing interactions are supposed to be ferromagnetic between neighbouring spins in each layer , @xmath3 , as well as between neighbouring spins in adjacent layers , @xmath4 , and to be antiferromagnetic , @xmath5 , between axial next  </S>",
    "<S> nearest neighbour spins , distinguishing one of the three cubic axes , say , the @xmath6axis . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting magnetic structures may exhibit non  trivial spatial modulations along the @xmath6axis . in the case of </S>",
    "<S> indefinitely many and indefinitely large layers , the model displays a phase diagram with a plenitude of commensurate phases , including those springing from the multiphase point at zero temperature and those emerging from structure combination branching processes at finite temperatures , as well as incommensurate structures , see the reviews @xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> we shall consider thin films of @xmath2 layers , with _ </S>",
    "<S> free _ boundary conditions at the surface layers . </S>",
    "<S> note that the annni model on finite lattices , connecting the first and last layers by _ periodic _ boundary conditions , has been studied quite extensively before , attempting to predict properties for @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the scope of the present study is , however , to determine the phase diagram of the annni model with _ </S>",
    "<S> free _ boundary conditions at fixed film thickness . </S>",
    "<S> attention may be also drawn to recent work on the semi  infinite annni model , analysing critical surface properties near the lifshitz point @xcite , which partly motivated our investigation .    to establish the phase diagrams for thin films , in particular for @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> , we used mean  field theory , monte carlo simulations and low temperature expansions . for simplicity , we set @xmath8 , both in the surface layers and in the bulk of the film . in mean  field approximation @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we solved the set of coupled non  </S>",
    "<S> linear equations for the layer magnetizations , @xmath9 , by standard iteration procedures starting from all possible combinations of fully ordered , @xmath10 or @xmath11 , or completely disordered , @xmath12 , layers , i.  e.from , in principle , @xmath13 distinct configurations . to identify the stable phase , at given temperature , @xmath14 , and ratio of competing interactions , @xmath15 , we calculated the free energy for all resulting structures . </S>",
    "<S> this approach seems to be suitable to map correctly , in mean  field approximation , the entire phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> the monte carlo simulations , using the single  </S>",
    "<S> spin flip algorithm , were performed for lattices with @xmath16 spins in each layer connected by periodic boundary conditions ( for thicker films , an efficient layer flip algorithm may be useful @xcite ) . to circumvent finite size effects due to the layer size </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath17 has to be chosen sufficiently large . </S>",
    "<S> actually , we varied @xmath17 from 10 to 100 . to identify the phases springing directly from the degenerate ground states at @xmath18 , low temperature expansions to leading , first order @xcite </S>",
    "<S> were found to suffice in most cases .    at zero temperature , both for @xmath2 odd and </S>",
    "<S> even , the ferromagnetic state is stable at @xmath19 . for @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> even , at @xmath20 , the ground state is the @xmath21 structure , where two layers of `` up '' ( `` down '' ) spins are followed by two layers of `` down '' ( `` up '' ) spins , with totally ( @xmath22 ) pairs of such layers ( in general , @xmath23 refers to a phase at low temperatures where a `` @xmath24band '' , i.  e.  spins in @xmath24 adjacent layers being oriented ( predominantly ) in one direction , say , `` + '' , is followed by a @xmath25band of spins being oriented ( predominantly ) in the opposite direction , say , `` ''@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath2 odd , structures consisting of 2bands and one 3band have the lowest energy at @xmath26 , while at @xmath27 the ground state contains 2bands with a 1band at one of the surfaces ( of course , @xmath28 plays no special role for the annni model with @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the transition line , at @xmath29 , between the corresponding phases is , at low temperatures , of first order .    </S>",
    "<S> the degeneracy , @xmath30 , of the multiphase point , at ( @xmath18 , @xmath31 ) , is related to the fibonacci sequence by @xmath32 , with @xmath33= 2 . </S>",
    "<S> we studied the vicinity of that point by using low temperature expansions @xcite . in the limit </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 @xcite , indefinitely many periodic , commensurate phases spring directly from that point , namely the ferromagnetic phase and phases in each of which 3bands are separated by a fixed number , @xmath34 , of 2bands , @xmath35 . in thin films , obviously only a few phases may arise from the multiphase point , in particular , the ferromagnetic phase as well as additional phases formed mostly by 2bands and 3bands . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath2 even , the @xmath21 phase will be among the additional phases , while for @xmath2 odd , all of these phases will have at least one 3band ( when it is just one 3band , then that band will be preferably in the center of the film ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that structures consisting of 3bands and a supplementary single 4band or a single 5band at one of the surfaces of the film occur when @xmath36 or @xmath37 , @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> examples of those phases bordering , at low temperatures , the ferromagnetic phase are the @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 phases . again in contrast to the case @xmath1 , phases with 2bands and _ pairs _ of 3bands may be stable as well ; examples are the @xmath42 and @xmath43 phases. to understand the phase diagram in the vicinity of the multiphase point one should be aware of the fact that the stable phases correspond to the ground state structures with a low energy and a large number of lowest  energy excitations . the latter property favours 3bands , where the spins in both edge layers can be excited easily when both the preceeding and the following band comprise at least two layers </S>",
    "<S> .     +     +    examples of entire phase diagrams are depicted in figs . 1 and 2 ( a more complete set of phase diagrams can be found elsewhere @xcite ) . in general , for thin films </S>",
    "<S> , there are not many ordered phases . </S>",
    "<S> the structures close to the transition to the paramagnetic phase , @xmath44 , may be obtained in mean  field approximation without difficulty from the linearized theory . </S>",
    "<S> one finds that the pattern of the layer magnetization @xmath45 is either symmetric or antisymmetric about the center of the film . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , some of the low temperature phases discussed above can not extend up to @xmath44 , e. g. the @xmath46 phase ( note that mean  field theory seems to reproduce the low temperature behaviour qualitatively correctly ) . </S>",
    "<S> each of the symmetric or antisymmetric phases is usually stable in a rather wide region of the phase diagram , for the thin films we considered . </S>",
    "<S> these features , symmetrization and possible instability of low temperature phases close to @xmath44 , are in marked contrast to the mean  field description of the annni model with @xmath1 , where the structures below @xmath44 form a devil s staircase . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps most interestingly , we identified a new type of antisymmetric phase , with the center layer of the film being disordered , for odd @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> examples are the @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 phases for @xmath2= 3 , 5 , 7 , and 9 ( we modified the standard low temperature notation in an obvious way by denoting the disordered layer by `` @xmath51 '' , i.  e.  for instance , @xmath47 stands for a magnetization pattern where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 ) . for @xmath55 , at larger ratio of the competing interactions , @xmath56 , one finds another partially disordered phase , namely the @xmath57 phase .    </S>",
    "<S> partially disordered phases , with period arrangements of disordered layers , occur in mean  field theory of the annni model , @xmath1 , at sufficiently weak intra  </S>",
    "<S> plane couplings , @xmath58 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they turned out to be an artefact of the approximation , as seen in monte carlo simulations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the present case , simulations confirm the prediction of mean  field theory of disordered center layers , as we checked for @xmath2 up to 9 . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , those phases are expected to exist only above the critical temperature of the two  dimensional ising model , see fig . 1 .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the sign of the magnetization @xmath45 may change , at higher temperatures , in some layers without any phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> to characterise such a phase , we based the notation , used in the phase diagrams , figs . 1 and 2 </S>",
    "<S> , on the magnetization pattern of that phase in the low temperature region . </S>",
    "<S> an example is the @xmath59 phase , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , where , close to @xmath44 , the magnetization in the third and sixth layers may change sign so that the 2band in the center expands , formally , to a 4band , with the 3bands shrinking to 2bands . </S>",
    "<S> however , the phase keeps its symmetry , and there is no transition or degeneracy associated with this change of sign .    at intermediate temperatures , interesting features are observed as well . in mean </S>",
    "<S>  field theory , the transition line to the @xmath60 phase at @xmath29 , being of first order at low temperatures , ends in a critical point ( @xmath61 , and 9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> simulations , for @xmath62 , seem to be in qualitative agreement , see fig . 1 , but careful and extensive finite  size analyses are needed to establish this aspect definitely . moreover , at intermediate temperatures additional phases may be stabilized , springing neither directly from the ground states nor being ( anti)symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> an example is the @xmath63 phase for @xmath55 ( undergoing , at higher temperatures , a transition to the symmetric @xmath50 phase ) . indeed , if @xmath2 gets large enough , structure combination branching processes may happen , when being compatible with the film thickness ( again , with , possibly , slight rearrangements and modifications of bands , especially near the surface , as in the low temperature region ) .    in summary , most of the distinct commensurate phases of the annni model in the limit </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 are suppressed in thin films . perhaps surprisingly , however , modified structures and novel phases are induced by the ( small ) thickness of the film , @xmath2 , for example , among the phases springing directly from the multiphase point and among those close to the paramagnetic transition line . </S>",
    "<S> certainly , it may be interesting to study the robustness of the findings against varying model parameters such as , for instance , the intralayer coupling , @xmath58 , in the surface planes .    </S>",
