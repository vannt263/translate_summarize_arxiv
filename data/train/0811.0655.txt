    "in 1970s , hawking @xcite justified that the black holes should be treated as a thermodynamic system which contributes the temperature associated with its surface gravity , viz @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the surface gravity at the horizon . shortly before this discovery , the concept of black hole entropy is originally developed by bekenstein @xcite .",
    "the famous result is that the entropy of black hole is proportional to the area of its horizon .",
    "the quantitative entropy is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the area of horizon . in this way",
    ", there are many literatures @xcite studying the origin of black hole entropy by various approaches .",
    "one of them is the famous brick wall method ( bwm ) shown by t hooft . in this model",
    ", there is a brick wall around event horizon . in order to avoid the occurrence of divergent entropy ( or free energy ) , the matter field is assumed to be vanished beyond a mini - distance outside black hole .",
    "then brick wall and black hole construct a thermodynamic system .",
    "the entropy of black hole is identified with the statistical mechanical entropy created by the excitation of external quantum field .",
    "however , the application of bwm must satisfy the condition that the external field should be in thermal equilibrium with black hole in a large spatial region , i.e. , bwm should not be used directly to the nonequilibrium system such as a black hole with multi - horizon .",
    "recently , this confinement was solved by an improved bwm  the thin - layer approach @xcite . in the thin - layer model ,",
    "the large thermodynamics equilibrium is replaced by the local equilibrium on a microscopic scale .",
    "the mathematical difference of integration range implies a distinct physical significance . as an effective approach to nonequilibrium systems ,",
    "the thin - layer model is usually employed to study many types of multi - horizon spaces , for instance , schwarzschild - de sitter black hole@xcite , kerr - de sitter black hole @xcite , vaidya black hole @xcite and so on @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we try to use the thin - layer method to study the entropy of a 5d nonequilibrium black string , which there are two horizons that one is event horizon and the other is cosmological horizon .    here",
    "the space - time - matter ( stm ) @xcite @xcite theory is mentioned as the foundation of this work . in stm , the extra dimension is non - compacted .",
    "the 5d manifold is ricci - flat while the 4d hypersurface is curved by the 4d induced matter .",
    "mathematically , this approach is supported by campbell s theorem @xcite .",
    "recently an accelerating universe has proposed to be a way to interpret the astronomical data of type ia supernovae @xcite . combining this astonishing observation in the standard",
    "cosmology leads to that our universe approaches de sitter geometries in both past and future @xcite .",
    "hence we consider a schwarzschild - de sitter black hole embedded into a 5d ricci - flat space .",
    "a class of 5d ricci - flat black hole solutions containing a 4d de sitter space are shown by mashhoon et al @xcite @xcite @xcite . in our previous work @xcite , a system with double randall - sundrum ( rs ) branes is constructed using these solutions .",
    "if matter trapped on the brane undergoes gravitational collapse , a black hole will form naturally and its horizon extends into the extra dimension which is transverse to brane .",
    "such higher dimensional object looked like a black hole on the brane is actually a black string in the higher dimensional brane world .",
    "hence a 5d ricci - flat black string is obtained naturally .",
    "as one candidate of higher dimensional black holes , its thermodynamical aspect is needed to be studied .",
    "on the other hand , in the last decade of 20th century the additional spacelike dimensional add model @xcite and rs model @xcite @xcite raise the upsurge of study higher dimensional brane world . based on these brane world model , various black holes",
    "are studied @xcite and their entropy also becomes an interesting topic @xcite , and the stm theory is equivalent to the brane world model @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "therefore it is worth to study the entropy of 5d ricci - flat black string with a 4d effective cosmological constant .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , the 5d ricci - flat black string metric and the surface gravity near horizons are presented . in section iii , by semi - classical method the quantized modes are obtained with wkb approximation . in section",
    "vi , the entropy of 5d ricci - flat black string is calculated with the assumption of far apart two branes .",
    "we adopt the signature @xmath4 and put @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 equal to unity .",
    "greek indices @xmath8 will be taken to run over @xmath9 as usual , while capital indices a , b , c , @xmath10 run over all five coordinates @xmath11 .",
    "a static , three - dimensional spherically symmetric 5d line element having a 4d effective cosmological constant takes the form @xcite @xcite @xcite @xmath12-d\\xi^{2 } , \\label{eq:5dmetric}\\ ] ] which actually is a black brane solution in brane world .",
    "the metric function is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an open non - compact extra dimension coordinate and @xmath15 is the central mass .",
    "one should note that the above @xmath16 is an induced cosmological constant which is obtained by the reduction from 5d to 4d . in another words , since this metric ( [ eq:5dmetric ] ) is ricci - flat @xmath17 , there is no cosmological constant in 5d space .",
    "so one can actually deal with this @xmath16 as a parameter which comes from the fifth dimension .",
    "the part of this metric inside the square bracket is exactly the same line - element as the 4d schwarzschild - de sitter solution , which is bounded by two horizons  an inner horizon ( event horizon ) and an outer horizon ( cosmological horizon ) .",
    "this solution has been studied in many works @xcite focusing mainly on the induced constant @xmath16 , the extra force and so on .    in the work of @xcite ,",
    "the binary randall - sundrum branes system is constructed .",
    "now we briefly list the nontrivial results below . by a coordinate transformation",
    "@xmath18 @xcite , the metric ( [ eq:5dmetric ] ) then takes a manifestly conformally form @xmath19.\\label{eq:5dmetric - y}\\ ] ] then we use this metric to construct a rs type brane model in which the first brane is at @xmath20 , and the second brane is at @xmath21 . in this way",
    "the double brane model is obtained , and the fifth dimension becomes finite .",
    "it could be very small as in rs 2-brane model @xcite or very large as in rs 1-brane model @xcite , and it is a black string intersecting the brane world , that is to say , on the hypersurface of fixed extra dimension this metric describes a sds black hole .",
    "however , when viewed from 5d , the horizon does not form a 4d sphere  it looks like a black string lying along the fifth dimension .",
    "hence we call the solution ( [ eq:5dmetric ] ) black string . arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) mass @xmath22 of the black string measured on the second brane is @xmath23 while its adm mass @xmath24 locating at the first brane",
    ".    the metric function ( [ f - function ] ) can be recomposed as follows @xmath25    the singularity of the metric ( [ eq:5dmetric - y ] ) is determined by @xmath26 . here",
    "we only consider the real solutions .",
    "the solutions to this equation are black hole event horizon @xmath27 , cosmological horizon @xmath28 and a negative solution @xmath29 .",
    "the last one has no physical significance , and @xmath28 and @xmath27 are given as    @xmath30    where @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "the real physical solutions are accepted only if @xmath16 satisfy @xmath33 @xcite .    so according to the metric function , the tortoise coordinate is @xmath34 integration of this equation shows that @xmath35 can be expressed explicitly in the following form:@xmath36,\\label{tortoise of gravitaion surface}\\ ] ]",
    "where@xmath37 that is @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 according to hawking temperature formula ( [ temperature ] ) , there are two distinct temperatures near event horizon @xmath27 and cosmological horizon @xmath28 .",
    "so the 5d black string space is a nonequilibrium system apparently .",
    "therefore , the bwm can not be applied directly to this multi - horizon space .",
    "so the proper selection is thin - layer approach  improved bwm method .",
    "being a minimally coupled quantum scalar field @xmath41 with mass @xmath42 , the field equation on the background ( [ eq:5dmetric - y ] ) is @xmath43 the modes of the scalar field can be decomposed as the separable form , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the particle energy and @xmath46 is the usual spherical harmonic function .",
    "then the equations for @xmath47 and @xmath48 read as follows ,    @xmath49    the eigenvalue @xmath50 is the effective mass on the brane and eq.([r ] ) is exactly the same as the usual radial equation of massive scalar particle around 4d sds black hole .",
    "the similar effective mass can be found in the entropy of rs black string @xcite . according to the above adm mass relationship ( [ rsrelationofmass ] )",
    ", one can get the effective mass @xmath51 located on the two branes , @xmath52",
    "in the interest of the entropy of this black string , we investigate the modes along the fifth dimension @xmath53 before the other four dimensions ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "it is expected to find the definite expression of @xmath51 which plays a role of the effective mass on the brane .",
    "( [ l ] ) is simplified as follows , @xmath55 we assume the modes of the fifth dimension is @xmath56 and the wave number @xmath57 of wave function @xmath47 is @xmath58 .",
    "here we employ wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) approximation @xcite in which the wave function is expanded in a series of planck constant @xmath5 ( small quantity ) .",
    "so the result can be obtained by stagewise approximation . by wkb approximation @xcite",
    ", the wave number @xmath57 can be written as @xmath59    the extra dimension wave number @xmath60 satisfies the semi - classical quantization condition @xmath61 where the tensions of branes are not restricted .",
    "it is very hard to directly solve @xmath51 from the above function . in order to simplify calculation , the effective adm mass relationship ( [ mumass ] )",
    "is adopted here .",
    "if the first brane @xmath62 is our real world , the rs relation is reduced to @xmath63 . substituting this adm mass relationship into the quantization condition ( [ ny ] ) , the expected expression of effective adm mass",
    "can be obtained as @xmath64 where @xmath65 so the modes of extra dimension is quantized and the mass is discretized naturally .",
    "apparently , @xmath66 can be used to determine the relationship between adm mass and the position of brane .",
    "we call parameter @xmath66 the adm mass factor whose function is drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "( @xmath67 is assumed).,title=\"fig:\",width=3 ] +    it is clear that if @xmath68 , the limit of @xmath69 exists and the modes spectrum is continuous .",
    "similar behavior can be found in the work of the rs black string @xcite .",
    "we assume the radial wave function satisfies @xmath70 . making use of the wkb approximation ,",
    "we can obtain a r - dependent radial wave number @xmath71 by @xmath72f^{-1}(r).\\ ] ] in usual 4d space , the mass @xmath51 is always treated as a small mass approximation and sometimes is ignored during calculation .",
    "however , it is not necessary to do this and the @xmath51 is kept as the effective adm mass in higher dimensional gravity such as in randall - sundrum black string @xcite .",
    "the number of radial wave @xmath73 is also obtained via the semi - classical quantized condition , @xmath74 so the total number of modes @xmath75 with energy less than or equal to @xmath45 is given by @xmath76 according to the canonical assembly theory with definite particles number @xmath77 , volume @xmath78 and temperature @xmath79 , the free energy of the quantum scalar field at inverse temperature @xmath80 is written as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the density of states and the summation is substituted by integration with semiclassical view . substituting state function @xmath83 into eq . ( [ freeenergy ] ) , we get @xmath84 the @xmath85 integral can be simplified by restricting integral range , and the f can be explicitly written as @xmath86^{3/2}.\\ ] ] in order to separate the variable @xmath51 and metric function @xmath87 , the integrand can be expanded in a series .",
    "here we assume the two branes are very far apart each other .",
    "a new parameter @xmath88 is introduced . when the second brane is sent to infinite , i.e. @xmath89",
    ", the parameter @xmath90 can be treated naturally as small quantity according to the effective adm mass ( [ muexpress ] ) . so using the relationship @xmath91 , the free energy ( [ freeenergy2 ] ) is rewritten as @xmath92 the first term is exactly the same as the usual 4d sds case @xcite and the second shows the effect of extra dimension in brane world .",
    "then the integral range of radial direction is determined by the improved thin - layer bwm boundary conditions @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the infinitesimal cutoff factors ( @xmath96 ) ; @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the thickness of thin - layer .",
    "then the main contributions of the integration near horizons @xmath99 and @xmath100 are given respectively by @xmath101 here the total free energy is @xmath102 .",
    "hence , the entropy of 5d ricci - flat black string is given by @xmath103 with @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the ares of two horizons ; @xmath107 is determined by effective cosmological constant , namely , @xmath108 .",
    "the above simplified representation is obtained by using the surface gravity expressions ( [ ge])@xmath109([go ] ) and horizons expressions ( [ re - rc ] ) .",
    "the relationships between inverse hawking temperature @xmath80 and horizons are @xmath110    it is clear that the 5d black string entropy ( [ entropy ] ) is a linear sum of the area of the black hole horizon and that of the cosmological horizon . comparing with 4d case , the 5d ricci - flat black string s entropy is modified by the second item of proportionality coefficients @xmath111 and @xmath112 , which are discretized by the quantized extra dimensional modes .",
    "furthermore , it is well known that the small mass approximation in 4d case is considered as the contribution of the vacuum surrounding black hole in brick - wall method @xcite , which is very unnatural and is tried to be solved by many people .",
    "however , in this 5d ricci - flat black brane solution , the small mass is obtained naturally by the topological property of far apart binary branes . when the second brane is sent far away , the adm mass factor @xmath66 tends to infinity .",
    "hence , the effective adm mass on the first brane is naturally small .",
    "if extra dimension does exist and is visible near black hole , this nontrivial entropy may can show something interesting .",
