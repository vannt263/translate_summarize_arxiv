    "posedness for semilinear wave equation was addressed for higher dimensions and nonlinearities in @xcite , and then almost completely answered in @xcite .",
    "once the euclidean case was more or less settled , several attemps have been made in order to establish strichartz estimates for dispersive equations in other settings .",
