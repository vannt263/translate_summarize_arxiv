    "a great effort has recently gone into the search for practical architecture for quantum information processing systems . in this paper",
    "we focus on optical implementations of quantum information processing systems  in particular quantum phase gate@xcite .",
    "one of the possible ways to realize this system requires strong interaction of the photonic qubits .",
    "sufficiently strong interactions have been unavailable until recently .",
    "the effect of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit)@xcite and its use in the implementation of nonlinear optical interactions opened a way for generation of large optical nonlinearities , and hence strong photon - photon interactions  @xcite .",
    "a significant cross - phase modulation is the key ingredient for the implementation of a quantum phase gate between two optical qubits .",
    "such a cross - phase modulation could be realized exploiting the cross - kerr effect whereby an optical field acquires a phase shift conditioned to the state of another optical field .",
    "the relevant gate transformation is defined through the following input - output relations @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denote the qubit basis . in particular , this becomes a universal two - qubit gate , that is a gate able to entangle two initially factorized qubits , when the conditional phase shift @xmath3 becomes different from zero@xcite .",
    "a natural choice for encoding binary information in optical beams consists in using the polarization degree of freedom , in which case the two logical basis states @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the above gate transformation correspond to two orthogonal light polarizations .",
    "a possible experimental implementation can be realized with the tripod scheme shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tripod ] by using @xmath6rb atoms confined in a temporal dark spot ( spontaneous - force optical trap ) .",
    "this is a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) where the repumping beam has been temporarily shut off@xcite . in such a trap",
    "cold atoms are transferred in the @xmath7 state(s ) of @xmath6rb while density is increased with respect to a conventional mot . in this case",
    "states @xmath5 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 correspond to the ground state zeeman sublevels @xmath10 , and state @xmath11 corresponds to the excited state @xmath12 .",
    "the atoms are available for just a few milliseconds which is long compared with the typical microsecond time scales involved in our proposed experiment .     denote the laser ( frequency @xmath13 ) detunings from the respective transitions @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 s denote rabi frequencies of the respective fields .",
    "cross - phase modulation is achieved between the _ probe _ and the _ trigger _ fields ( driving transitions @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively ) [ fig : tripod ] ]    a universal qpg could be implemented when a significant and non - trivial cross - phase modulation between probe and trigger fields arises but only for one of the four input probe and trigger polarization configurations .",
    "this occurs for our tripod configuration of fig .",
    "[ fig : tripod ] only when the probe is @xmath18 polarized and the trigger is @xmath19 polarized .",
    "when the probe has instead a @xmath19 polarization [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmamm ] ) ] , that is to say the `` wrong '' polarization , there is no sufficiently close level it may couple to and hence the corresponding pulse will acquire the trivial ( vacuum ) phase shift @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the length of the medium . the trigger pulse with the `` correct '' @xmath19 polarization ,",
    "on the other hand , will acquire in this case the linear phase shift @xmath22 it is worth noticing here that for sufficiently narrow probe and trigger laser linewidths and nearly equal detunings as used in our scheme , cross - phase modulation between the two @xmath19 polarized probe and trigger pulses [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmamm ] ) ] does not occur for sublevels zeeman shifts larger than ( half ) the eit transparency bandwidth .",
    "owing to the fact that such a bandwidth is typically smaller than @xmath23 , or even much smaller as in the case that we examine ( @xmath24 ) , cross - kerr nonlinearities for the case of a wrong probe polarization [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmamm ] ) ] can readily be avoided for sufficiently large zeeman splittings polarized probe , e.g. , couples to the @xmath25 transition , it would fall outside the transparency windows already for zeeman splittings of several @xmath23 s leading to a vanishing cross - kerr modulation . ] .",
    "this is realistic assumption , given that the zeeman splitting of levels @xmath26 and @xmath27 is typically as large as @xmath28 , thus giving a two orders of magnitude difference between the size of the transparency window and the frequency of the (  wrong \" ) trigger transition .",
    "zeeman shift of this size also insures that the ",
    "wrong \" polarization qubit is not absorbed outside the transparency window .",
    "the case of a wrong @xmath18 polarized trigger [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmapp ] ) ] can be discussed in just the same way leading to a vacuum shift @xmath29 and to a linear shift @xmath30 which obtain from the @xmath31 and @xmath32 above upon interchanging @xmath33 .",
    "when probe and trigger both have the `` wrong '' polarization , i.e. probe is @xmath34 polarized and trigger @xmath35 polarized , there is no sufficiently close level to which probe and trigger can be coupled to and the fields acquire the trivial vacuum phase shift @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "a probe and a trigger polarized single photon wave packets form a qubit@xcite @xmath38 this qubit is a superposition of two circularly polarized states @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a gaussian frequency distribution of incident wave packets , centered at frequency @xmath41 . traversing the atomic medium of length @xmath21 , the photon field operator undergoes a transformation @xmath42 the real part of the refractive index @xmath43",
    "can be assumed to vary slowly over the bandwidth of the wave packets @xmath44 , giving rise to a phase shift on a circularly polarized states @xmath45 , where @xmath46 for a gaussian trigger pulse of time duration @xmath47 and rabi frequency @xmath48 , moving with group velocity @xmath49 , the nonlinear probe phase shift can be written as @xmath50}{\\zeta_p } \\ , { \\rm re}[\\chi_p^{(3)}],\\ ] ] where @xmath51 .",
    "the trigger shift is obtained upon interchanging @xmath33 in the equation above , namely @xmath52}{\\zeta_t } \\ , { \\rm re}[\\chi_t^{(3)}],\\ ] ] where also the expression for @xmath53 has to be changed accordingly .",
    "the expressions for nonlinear susceptibilities are@xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 is density of a medium , @xmath56 are electric dipole matrix elements for probe and trigger transitions while the complex detunings are defined as @xmath57 and @xmath58 for @xmath59 . also , @xmath60 are spontaneous emission rates and @xmath61 are dephasing rates .    the truth table for a polarization qpg that uses our tripod configuration reads as @xmath62 with @xmath63 and @xmath64 and where the conditional phase shift is given by @xmath65 notice that only the nonlinear shifts contribute to @xmath66 . the truth table of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sigmamm]-  [ eq : sigmapm ] ) differs from that of ottaviani _",
    "et al._@xcite only for the presence of a linear phase shift for the trigger , arising from the fact that also level @xmath27 is populated with one half of the atoms .    in the @xmath6rb level configuration chosen above , the decay rates are equal @xmath67 and we take for simplicity equal and small dephasing rates @xmath68 . for @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and detunings",
    "@xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 we obtain a conditional phase shift of @xmath0 radians over an interaction length @xmath74 mm at a density @xmath75 @xmath76 . with these parameters , group velocities",
    "are essentially the same , giving @xmath77/\\zeta_p = \\rm{erf}[\\zeta_t]/\\zeta_t \\approx 2/\\sqrt{\\pi}$ ] .",
    "this choice of parameters corresponds to the case where probe and trigger have a mean amplitude of about one photon when the beams are tightly focused ( @xmath781 @xmath79 m ) and with a time duration in the microsecond scale .",
    "in addition , it is worthwhile noting that a classical phase gate could be implemented by using more intense probe and trigger pulses . for rabi frequencies",
    "@xmath80 , @xmath81 , and detunings @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , a conditional phase shift of @xmath0 radians , over the interaction length @xmath85 cm , density @xmath86 @xmath76 is obtained . again , with these parameters , group velocities are the same .",
    "both sets of parameters could be realized with cold atoms in a temporal dark spot of a mot .",
    "alternatively , a gas cell of standard length between 2.5 cm and 10 cm can be considered , but the increase in length is then compensated with a lower density . in this case one has to take care to use all co - propagating laser beams to cancel the first order doppler effect@xcite .",
    "this shows that a demonstration of a deterministic polarization qpg can be made using present technologies .",
    "in this paper we have presented the proposal for a realization of an optical polarization phase gates .",
    "the requirements for a gate operation have been discussed in detail .",
    "the gate can be realized using present technologies in a cold atomic sample of @xmath87rb atoms .",
