    "stochastic phenomena have emerged universally in many physical systems due to noise , disturbance and uncertainty .",
    "the unpredictability to them leads to it a great challenge to stabilize a stochastic system . during the past decades ,",
    "the stabilization of nonlinear stochastic systems had constituted one of central problems in stochastic process control both theoretically and practically .",
    "a great deal of methods emerge as the times require , among which stochastic passivity based control is a popular one . rooting in the passivity theory @xcite and the stochastic version of lyapunov theorem @xcite , the stochastic passivity theory @xcite was developed for stabilization and control of nonlinear stochastic systems . by means of state feedback laws ,",
    "the asymptotic stabilization in probability can be achieved for a stochastic affine system provided some rank conditions are fulfilled and the unforced stochastic affine system is lyapunov stable in probability @xcite . following this study , lin et .",
    "al . @xcite explored the relationship between a stochastic passive system and the corresponding zero - output system , and further established the global stabilization results .",
    "parallelizing to the development of stochastic passivity in theory , satoh et .",
    "al . @xcite applied this methodology to port - hamiltonian systems , and the solutions for stabilization of a large class of nonlinear stochastic systems are thus available .",
    "there are also some reports that stochastic passivity is applied to @xmath1 filtering problem @xcite and controlling stochastic mechanical systems @xcite .    despite the large success achieved",
    ", stochastic passivity based control seems to only work under the condition that the noise vanishes at the stationary solution ( very often being at the origin ) if a radially unbounded lyapunov function is expected as the storage function .",
    "this means that if a stochastic system has nonzero noise port at the stationary solution or has persistent noise port , such a method may be out of action .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to derive the necessary conditions that a stochastic system is stochastically passive , and further give the sufficient conditions to say a stochastic system losing stochastic passivity .",
    "equivalently , we prove that there does not exist a radially unbounded lyapunov function rendering the stochastic system to be globally asymptotically stable in probability provided the noise does not vanish at the desired state .",
    "the ubiquitousness of such a class of systems in the mechanical and biological fields motivates us to define a kind of novel stability , termed as stochastic asymptotic weak stability , to characterize a certain ( globally ) stable behavior for them .",
    "the stochastic asymptotic weak stability requests the system state to be convergent in distribution and ergodic .",
    "the former means the state to evolve within a small region around the desired state in a large probability while the latter ensures that the state evolution almost always take place within this region .    on the face of it ,",
    "the stochastic asymptotic weak stability is somewhat similar to the concept of stochastic bounded stability proposed in in that a stochastic system with persistent noise is considered for the same purpose .",
    "that concept also means that the state will evolve within a bounded region around a desired state with a large probability which depends on the region radius .",
    "especially when the region radius goes infinite , the probability will be one . however , there is evident difference between these two kinds of stability .",
    "stochastic bounded stability can not characterize the ergodicity of the state .",
    "namely , once the trajectory of the state runs out of the bounded region with a small probability , the coming evolution will take place in a larger bounded region to reach a  new \" stochastic bounded stability with a larger probability .",
    "in addition , the stochastic asymptotic weak stability is different from stochastic noise - to - state and input - to - state stability too .",
    "the latter two kinds of stability also serves for characterizing the stable behavior of stochastic systems with nonvanishing noise .",
    "they describe the convergence of the expectation of the state , for which the transition measure is controlled by defining a particular function . comparatively speaking ,",
    "they say nothing about the ergodicity of the state , and do not mean either that the state must evolve within a small region around the desired state .",

    "stettner @xcite pointed out that the strongly feller and irreducible process are stable in distribution .",

    "give us large inspiration on developing the stabilizing ways in weak sense for stochastic systems with nonvanishing noise .",
    "in this paper , we will show that the recurrent property of a stochastic system is highly relevant to the stochastic passivity behavior . based on this comparison",
    ", we define the stochastic passivity not in the whole state space , but only outside a ball centered around the desired state , which is labeled as stochastic weak passivity in the context . within the framework of stochastic weak passivity",
