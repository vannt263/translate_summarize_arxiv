    "emergence of spontaneous synchronization in a population of interacting elements is one important issue in the nonlinear dynamics and complex networks . investigating the intrinsic microscopic mechanism of such phenomena provides insights for understanding the collective behaviors in a wide variety of fields , such as the flashing of fireflies , circadian rhythms , electrochemical and spin - toque oscillators , applause formation in a large audience , the power grids , and then again in other real systems  @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the most successful model for studying synchronization problem was introduced by kuramoto  @xcite , which stands for the classical paradigms for synchronization and turns out to be analytical solvable . during the last decades , the kuramoto model with its generalizations have inspired and simulated extensive studies from serval aspects , including the fundamental theory analysis and their relevance to practice  @xcite .",
    "the kuramoto model describes the evolution of an ensemble of coupled phase oscillators by means of a set of time differential equations , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is instantaneous phase of the @xmath2th oscillator , @xmath3 is its natural frequency usually extracted from a certain probability density function @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the global coupling strength .",
    "eq.(1 ) describes the system towards synchrony characterized by the order parameter , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a complex valued vector on the complex plane , @xmath8 is the collective amplitude , @xmath9 is its phase .",
    "it has been shown that , with the increasing of coupling strength @xmath10 , the system transits from the incoherent state , in which @xmath11 , and the oscillators evolve almost according to their natural frequency , into the coherent state , in which @xmath12 , and a number of oscillators became synchronized , sharing a common effective frequency @xmath13 .",
    "as already well know results  @xcite , kuramoto showed that in the limit @xmath14 , and the natural frequency distribution function @xmath4 is one peaked , symmetric with respective to its center @xmath15 , a continuous second - order phase transition occurs at the critical coupling strength , @xmath16 and the collective amplitude @xmath17 satisfies the @xmath18 scale - law @xmath19 close to the critical point @xmath20 . with further increasing of @xmath10 above @xmath20 ,",
    "other oscillators may in turn be entrained by the synchronized group , forming a macroscopic oscillating cluster , and the size of cluster become larger and larger , when @xmath10 is large enough , eventually , all the oscillators totally coincide with each other , as the consequence , @xmath21 become a vector on the unit circle and @xmath17 approaches to @xmath22 characterizing the system become complete synchrony .",
    "remarkably , the only heterogeneity of the classical kuramoto model lies in their natural frequency , while the dispersion of frequencies competes with the attractive coupling @xmath10 , in a way that a phase transition to synchronization takes place when the coupling strength is strong enough , or the frequency distribution @xmath4 is sufficiently narrow .",
    "a straightforward extension of the current model is to add a new component of heterogeneity into the coupling strength , which is a natural attribute in the realistic systems  @xcite . for examples ,",
    "when the phase oscillators are set on complex networks , the network properties strongly impact the route to synchronization , moreover , this structure heterogeneity is equivalent to the coupling heterogeneity in a mean - field form under suitable approximation  @xcite .",
    "in particular , recent studies of the traveling state , the @xmath23-state in an ensemble of coupled phase oscillators is essentially a special case of heterogeneity coupling pattern , where the interacting strength among elements has only two kinds of possible choice , either @xmath10 or @xmath24 with different proportion coefficient  @xcite . furthermore , it has been shown that the kuramoto model with frequency - weighted coupling can lead to non - trivial dynamical consequences , such as the discontinuous transition to collective synchronization in general networks  @xcite , the chimera states  @xcite , and the landau damping effects in conformist and contrarian oscillators  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend the kuramoto theory by incorporating an additional source of heterogeneity with the coupling strength as advanced above , we present a complete framework to investigate the generalized frequency - weighted model .",
    "first , we establish rigorous self - consistency equations for the order parameter amplitude and the synchronization frequency @xmath13 , through which all the possible steady states of the system could be predicted .",
    "in contrast to the case of homogeneous coupling , the synchronization frequency is not necessarily equal to the mean value of the natural frequency , actually , the critical frequency @xmath25 plays an important role in determining the critical coupling strength @xmath20 .",
    "second , we pay our particular attentions to the relaxation dynamics of incoherent state when @xmath26 , a detailed linear stability analysis of the incoherent state is performed , it is shown that the linearized operator has no discrete eigenvalues below the critical threshold .",
    "furthermore , as the byproduct of the formulation , the explicit expression for the critical coupling strength is also obtained , which keeps the unified form for the classical kuramoto model eq.(3 ) and is consistent with the mean - field theory .",
    "the linear stability foretells that the incoherent state is only neutral stable to perturbation , nevertheless , we report an theoretical analysis and show that the relaxation to the incoherent state is indeed exponential by means of the resonance poles theory , meanwhile , the relaxation rate can be solved in a general framework . together with the numerical simulations that verify our theoretical analyses , in the following , we report our main results , both theoretically and numerically .",
    "the kuramoto model with generalized frequency - weighted coupling is described by the following dynamical equations , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a real value function of the natural frequency @xmath3 .",
    "the most important characteristic of the current model is that we extend the frequency dependence to a generalized function , in contrast to the previous studies of frequency - weight coupling , where @xmath29 or @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "( [ equ : re5 ] ) defines a heterogeneous interaction pattern underlying the system , apart from the global coupling @xmath5 , the coupling strength between oscillators is weighted by their frequency @xmath3 , which is a reasonable consideration in the role of realistic systems .",
    "the definition eq .",
    "( [ equ : re2 ] ) allows us to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ equ : re5 ] ) in the mean - field form , which yields @xmath31 here @xmath32 can be interpreted as an effective coupling strength , eq .",
    "( [ equ : re6 ] ) reflects that the interaction to oscillator @xmath2 is equivalent to a phase @xmath33 , and weighted by the effective coupling @xmath32 .",
    "note that , the effective coupling here can be either positive or negative according to the sign of weighted - function @xmath28 . as a matter of fact",
    ", the oscillators in the ensemble can be in general grouped into two populations , when @xmath34 , the coupling to the mean - field is attractive , and synchronization is triggered by these oscillators , whereas @xmath35 , the interaction to the mean - field turns out to be repulsive , as a result , synchronization is suppressed .    since we are interested in the steady state of the system , and thus the self - consistence method turns out to be effective .",
    "in the long time limit , we assume eq .",
    "( [ equ : re5 ] ) approaches to a stationary state , where the collective amplitude @xmath17 is independent of time and the mean - field phase @xmath33 rotates uniformly with a frequency , i.e , @xmath36 , after an appropriate phase shift , we can set @xmath37 . by introducing the phase difference : @xmath38 eq .",
    "( [ equ : re6 ] ) can be transformed into @xmath39 in the rotating frame , the evolution of each oscillator can be thought of as resulting from the interaction with the mean - field @xmath21 . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath40 , a density function @xmath41 on a @xmath42 space , with dependence on the parameter @xmath43",
    "is needed , where @xmath44 gives the fraction of oscillators of natural frequency @xmath43 , which lie between the phase deviation @xmath45 and @xmath46 at time @xmath47 with the normalization condition : @xmath48 and @xmath49-period in @xmath45 .",

    "<S> * we generalize the kuramoto model for the synchronization transition of globally coupled phase oscillators to populations by incorporating an additional heterogeneity with the coupling strength , where each oscillator pair interacts with different coupling strength weighted by a genera ; function of their natural frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the expression for the critical coupling can be straightforwardly extended to a generalized explicit formula analytically , and s self - consistency approach is developed to predict the stationary states in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> the landau damping effect is further revealed by means of the linear stability analysis and resonance poles theory above the critical threshold which turns to be far more generic . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the dimensionality reduction technique of the ott - antonsen is implemented to capture the analytical description of relaxation dynamics of the steady states valid on a globally attracting manifold . </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical analysis and numerical results are consistent with each other , which can help us understand the synchronization transition in general networks with heterogenous couplings . * </S>"
