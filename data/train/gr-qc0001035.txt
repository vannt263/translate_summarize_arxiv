    "after the initial experiments with room temperature resonant detectors , the new generation of cryogenic gravitational wave ( gw ) antennas entered long term data taking operation in 1990 ( explorer  @xcite ) , in 1991 ( allegro  @xcite ) , in 1993 ( niobe  @xcite ) , in 1994 ( nautilus  @xcite ) and in 1997 ( auriga  @xcite ) .",
    "searches for coincident events between detectors have been performed . between explorer and nautilus and between explorer and niobe in the years 1995 and 1996 @xcite . between allegro and explorer with data recorded in 1991  @xcite . in both cases",
    "no significative coincidence excesses were found and an upper limit to gw bursts was calculated  @xcite .",
    "however , the upper limit determination has been done under the hidden hypothesis that the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is very large . according to theoretical estimations",
    "the signals expected from cosmic gw sources are extremely feeble , so small that extremely sensitive detectors are needed .",
    "in fact , according to present knowledge , the detectors available today have not yet reached the sensitivity to detect even a few events per year .",
    "thus it is important to study the problem of the upper limit determination in the cases the snrs of the observed @xmath0 are not large . in order to do this",
    "we have to discuss our definition of @xmath1 .",
    "the raw data from a resonant gw detector are filtered with a filter matched to short bursts @xcite .",
    "we describe now in more detail the procedure used for the gw detectors of the rome group , explorer and nautilus .",
    "after the filtering of the raw - data , @xmath0 are extracted as follows .",
    "be @xmath2 the filtered output of the electromechanical transducer which converts the mechanical vibrations of the bar in electrical signals .",
    "this quantity is normalized , using the detector calibration , such that its square gives the energy innovation @xmath3 of the oscillation for each sample , expressed in kelvin units . in absence of signals ,",
    "for well behaved noise due only to the thermal motion of the bar and to the electronic noise of the amplifier , the distribution of @xmath2 is normal with zero mean . the variance ( average value of the square of @xmath2 ) is called @xmath4 and is indicated with @xmath5 . the distribution of @xmath2 is f(x)=e^ [ normal ] for extracting @xmath0 ( in absence of signals the events are just due to noise ) we set a threshold in terms of a critical ratio defined by cr== [ creq ] where @xmath6 is the standard deviation of @xmath7 and we put snr_f= [ teffeq ]    the threshold is set at a value cr such to obtain , in presence of thermal and electronic noise alone , a number of events which can be easily exchanged among the other groups who participate to the data exchange . for about one hundred @xmath0 per day",
    "the threshold corresponds to an energy @xmath8 .",
    "we calculate now the theoretical probability to detect a signal with a given snr , in presence of a well behaved gaussian noise .",
    "we put @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the signal we look for and @xmath11 is the gaussian noise .",
    "we obtain easily @xcite probability(snr)=_snr_t^ e^- cosh()dy [ papou ] we put @xmath12 for the present explorer and nautilus detectors .",
    "we consider m detectors and search for m - fold coincidences over a total period of time @xmath13 during which all detectors are in operation .",
    "be @xmath14 the average number of accidental coincidences ( due to chance ) and @xmath15 the number of coincidences which are found within a given time window .    for events which have a poissonian distribution in time the expected average number of m - fold accidental coincidences",
    "is given @xcite by    of the @xmath16 detector .",
    "the accidental coincidence distribution can be estimated experimentally by proper shifting @xcite the event occurrence times of each detector . in the case of poissonian distribution",
    "the average number of the m - fold accidental coincidences coincides with that given by eq .",
    "[ enne ] . the comparison between @xmath15 and @xmath14 allows to reach some conclusion about the detection of gw or to establish an upper limit to their existence",
    ".    in paper @xcite and in the previous paper @xcite the upper limit has been estimated as follows .",
    "it has been found that , for various energy levels of the observed events , the number @xmath15 was smaller than or did not exceeded significantly @xmath14 .",
    "such numbers @xmath15 , one for each energy level , were used for calculating the upper limit .",
    "a poissonian distribution of the number of the observed events was considered together with the hypothesis of an isotropic distribution in the sky of the gw sources .",
    "the value of @xmath17 ( adimensional perturbation of the metric tensor ) was then derived @xmath18 the energy levels , using the detector cross - section for gravitational waves .",
    "this procedure can be objected on two points : + a)the most important point is that , as shown in @xcite , for snr small and up to values of a few dozens , the energy of an event is @xmath19 the energy of the gw absorbed by the detector .",
    "this means that we can not deduce the value of @xmath17 directly from the energy levels of the observed events ; + b)in addition , the efficiency of detection , again for snr values up to one or two dozens , is rather smaller than unity , and this changes the upper limit , particularly at small snr .",
    "we introduce a new procedure for estimating the upper limit , which circumvents the difficulties indicated in the above two points .",
    "the problem to determine the upper limit has been discussed in several papers . in particular in paper @xcite , as indicated by the pdg , @xcite and , more recently , in paper @xcite . according to @xcite the upper limit",
    "can be calculated using the relative belief updating ratio r(n_gw , n_c,|n)=e^-n_gw(1+)^n_c [ belief ] referring to a given period @xmath13 of data taking .",
    "this function is proportional to the likelihood and it allows to infer the probability to have @xmath20 signals for given priors ( using the bayes s theorem ) .",
    "it has already been used in high energy physics @xcite .",
    "we calculate the upper limit by solving the equation r(n_gw , n_c,|n)=0.05 [ cinque ] we remark that 5% does not represent a probability but it is an useful way to put a limit independently on the priors .",
    "[ cinque ] has a very interesting solution .",
    "putting @xmath21 we find @xmath22 , independent on the value of the background @xmath14 .",
    "if we use the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite we find that , for @xmath21 and @xmath23 , the upper limit is 3.09 ( almost identical to the previous one ) @xmath24 it decreases for increasing @xmath14 .",
    "the reason for this different behavior is due to the non- bayesan character of the calculations made in @xcite , as we discuss in the following .",
    "suppose we have @xmath21 and @xmath25 .",
    "this certainly means that the number of accidentals , whose average value can be determined with any desired accuracy , has undergone a fluctuation . for larger @xmath14 values , smaller is the ( @xmath26 ) probability that such fluctuation occur .",
    "thus one could reason that it is less likely that a number @xmath20 be associated to a large value of @xmath14 , since the observation gave @xmath21 .    according to the bayesan approach instead , as discussed in @xcite",
    ", one can not ignore the fact that the observation @xmath21 had already being made at the time the estimation of the upper limit is considered .",
    "the bayesan approach requires that , given @xmath21 and @xmath25 , one evaluate the @xmath27 that a number @xmath20 of signals exist .",
    "this @xmath27 of a possible signal is referred to the observation already made and , rather obviously , it can not depend on the previous fluctuation of the background , since the presence of a signal can not be related to the background due to the detector . mathematically , it is easy to demonstrate , using the results obtained in @xcite , that due to the poissonian character of the number of accidentals this @xmath28 ( for @xmath21 ) is indeed independent on @xmath14 .",
    "it can be seen , comparing the results of @xcite with those of @xcite , that the bayesan upper limits are for all values of @xmath15 and @xmath14 ( except @xmath29 ) , greater than those obtained with the non - bayesan procedure . in our opinion",
    "the bayesan approach has to be preferred , and so we do in this paper .",
    "if we have @xmath30 then we apply eq . [ belief ] .",
    "it is interesting to show the result for the case @xmath31 for the standard sensitivity bound of 5% .",
    "the result is given in fig.[bayes ]    we note that for @xmath32 and @xmath33 eq . [ belief ] can be approximated with n_gw [ appros ]    from the result shown in fig.[bayes ] it appears evident that the lowest upper limit is obtained for @xmath34 . in order to obtain",
    "@xmath35 one can raise the threshold used for determining the events .",
    "however in doing this one diminish the efficiency of detection , as shown in eq.[papou ] .",
    "whether the procedure to raise the threshold is convenient or not , it depends on the numerical effects of the two competing operations . certainly for large gw signals ,",
    "when the detection efficiency is always unity , it is much better to have a threshold that gives @xmath23 . for smaller signals one has to consider specific cases .",
    "however it can be seen that in the most interesting cases it is better to raise the threshold until we get @xmath36 .",
    "this will be shown in the section where we reconsider the upper limit obtained with allegro and explorer in 1991 @xcite .    in the estimation of the upper limit",
    "we consider the efficiency of detection , which we indicate with @xmath37 where @xmath38 refers to the @xmath16 detector . for explorer and nautilus the theoretical efficiency",
    "is obtained from eq .",
    "[ papou ] .",
    "we must relate the @xmath17 values of the gw to the energy @xmath39 absorbed by the detectors .",
    "we have to consider that the absorbed energy depends on the direction of the impinging gw and on its polarization . for taking care of the various polarization we use the average value dividing the cross section by a factor of two .",
    "we then have @xcite h=1.13  10 ^ -17 [ pola ] with the energy @xmath39 expressed in kelvin unit .",
    "this formula is valid only if the gw arrives perpendicularly to the detector axis ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "for a given direction we calculate the absorbed energy using the @xmath41 dependency .",
    "we also consider that for an isotropic distribution of sources the number of possible gw impinging directions is proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "the procedure for calculating the upper limit is accomplished thru the following points : + a ) consider various values of @xmath17 ; + b ) assume an isotropic distribution of the gw sources ; + c ) for each direction @xmath43 and for each @xmath17 calculate the absorbed energy @xmath44 by means of eq .",
    "[ pola ] and the @xmath45 dependency ; + d ) for each detector calculate the snr for the adsorbed energy by taking into consideration the noise @xmath46 : snr_k()= ,   k=1, .. ,m [ snrt ] e ) using the individual efficiencies @xmath47 consider the total efficiency @xmath48 ; + f ) integrate @xmath49 over @xmath43 with the weight @xmath50 , because of the assumed isotropic distribution of the sources ; + g ) from eq.[belief ] , given @xmath15 and @xmath14 , we obtain @xmath20 .",
    "we then divide @xmath20 by the result of point f ) and obtain for each value of @xmath17 the upper limit during the measuring time @xmath13 .",
    "we remark that in this case we have not used the energy of the observed events , as done instead previously @xcite .",
    "the total efficiency is calculated with the following eq .",
    "[ etotale ] .",
    "_ tot(h)= [ etotale ]    for more clarity we show in table [ procedura ] some of the steps needed for our calculation , using two parallel detectors and @xmath21 .",
    "we use the efficiency given by eq .",
    "[ papou ] , valid for a well behaved noise .    0.1 in    .",
    "procedure for calculating the upper limit with two detectors .",
    "we assume that one detector has noise @xmath51 , the other one has noise @xmath52 .",
    "for each value of @xmath17 we give : maximum energy adsorbed by the detector ( for @xmath53 ) , snr and efficiency of detection for each detector , total weighted efficiency ( having considered an isotropic distribution of the gw sources . due to the angular weighting @xmath54 ) .",
    "the upper limit is given by @xmath55 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ procedura ]",
    "in a previous paper @xcite the upper limit for gw bursts was calculated , using the data recorded by allegro and explorer in 1991 .",
    "we wish now to recalculate the upper limit according the considerations discussed in this paper .    in 1991",
    "the explorer data filtering was done differently from that described in this introduction . for both allegro and explorer the output of the electromechanical transducer",
    "was sent to lock - ins referred to the frequencies of the resonant modes .",
    "then the outputs of the lock - ins ( in phase and in quadrature ) were filtered searching for delta - like signals and combined for obtaining the energy innovation , which we still indicate with @xmath3 . in this case",
    "the probability to have an event ( above threshold @xmath56 ) due to a signal with given snr is obtained ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) with the following equation : probability(snr)=_snr_t^ e^-(snr+y ) i_o(2)dy [ bessel ] here @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the modified bessel function of order zero , and the noise temperature @xmath5 is the average value of the energy innovation @xmath3 .",
    "we recall that in a time period of 123 days 70 coincidences were found with a background of 59.3 . for extracting the events the allegro threshold was @xmath59 with a noise temperature @xmath60 . for explorer",
    "the threshold was @xmath61 also with @xmath60 . applying eq.[belief ]",
    "we find an upper limit of @xmath62 over the 123 days .    according to the previous considerations we can raise the event threshold , say for explorer , in order to reduce the number of accidentals .",
    "for instance , for a threshold @xmath63 we get @xmath64 and @xmath65 , obtaining , from eq .",
    "[ belief ] , the value @xmath66 .",
    "thus the procedure for calculating the upper limit with the bayesan approach when we have data at various thresholds , including cases with @xmath15 and @xmath14 different from zero , is the following .",
    "start with @xmath15 and @xmath14 for various thresholds and use eq.[belief ] for obtaining @xmath20 at each threshold .",
    "calculate the upper limit for various values of @xmath17 as shown in the previous section . for",
    "each @xmath17 take as upper limit the smallest value among those obtained by varying the threshold .",
    "clearly at large @xmath17 values , when we get @xmath21 , the upper limit is , for the entire period of time , @xmath22 .",
    "the result is shown in fig.[super ] together with that obtained previously in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the two upper limits are similar .",
    "the reason for this is due to the fact that in applying the previous algorithm @xcite we started from an energy level higher than the largest energy of the detected ( accidental ) coincidences , thus obtaining , at this level ( @xmath29 ) an upper limit of 3.09 very close to the value 2.99 obtained with the bayesan approach .",
    "the similarity of the results at lower @xmath17 values is accidental . in the previous algorithm",
    "the increase at lower @xmath17 is due only to the increase of the number @xmath14 of accidentals . in the present algorithm",
    "the increase is due to the smaller efficiency of detection and to the increase in @xmath20 which roughly goes with @xmath67 ( eq.[appros ] ) .    in spite of the similar numerical results",
    ", we believe that the procedure proposed here which does not extract the value of @xmath17 from the energy levels of the accidental coincidences and it uses the bayesan approach is methodologically more correct .",
    "the best upper limit which can be obtained with an array of @xmath68 identical parallel detectors in @xmath69 coincidence can not go below the value 2.99 , because this is the upper limit @xcite when one finds @xmath70 coincidences independently on the background .",
    "the basic advantage in using many detectors comes from the fact that with many detectors it is easier to obtain @xmath35 , and thus ( in absence of gw ) @xmath21 . because of the poisson distributions , the average number of accidental coincidences for m detectors in a time window @xmath71 is given by eq.[enne ] .",
    "on the time scale of 1 second ( w=1 s ) it turns out that @xmath72 . by increasing the number of detectors one obtains smaller values of @xmath14 , thus approaching the requirement to have @xmath21 and then the lowest possible upper limit .",
    "this is certainly true at large @xmath17 values , where the detection efficiency for all detectors is unity .",
    "the result , as shown in fig.[super ] , is a plateau .",
    "instead it might be convenient at low @xmath17 values to use the two most sensitive detectors , in order to have the largest possible efficiency of detection .",
    "the overall upper limit is then obtained by taking the smallest ones among the values of the various upper limit determinations .",
    "the above procedure can be easily adjusted to the more general case of any distribution of the gw sources , and of non - parallel detectors .",
