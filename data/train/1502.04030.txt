    "i new models of interacting dark energy have been introduced starting from a variational approach .",
    "defining a consistent variational set up for interacting dark energy models is an important issue not only for exploring new physical models in late time cosmology , but also for producing new theoretical mechanisms responsible for the phenomenology of such interactions . from the observational perspective",
    "a coupling between dark energy and dark matter might give rise to some effects which could be detected in forthcoming surveys .",
    "in fact , although non - interacting dark energy models can still accommodate the observations @xcite , such interaction is mildly favoured by the data @xcite , and can even alleviate some tensions present in the comparison of different datasets @xcite .",
    "for these reasons the theoretical development of interacting dark energy models should proceed to both drive future observations toward possible detectable features and to justify all the phenomenological models considered so far in the literature ; see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "the particular advantage arising from a variational formulation consists in generating fully covariant equations of motion , which can then be applied to cosmology at both the background and the perturbation level .",
    "it is a well known problem to understand how to promote the phenomenological background equations of interacting dark energy to their covariant counterparts , and a satisfactory solution is still missing @xcite . in fact , it will always be possible to construct two covariant theories which are equivalent at the background level but will have different perturbations .",
    "this is due to the non - linearity of the einstein field equations in general .",
    "hence , there is a strong motivation to construct models at the level of the action .    a variational approach , such as the one advanced in part i , permits to solve this problem by automatically producing the desired field equations .",
    "in part i a canonical scalar field describing dark energy , namely quintessence , has been coupled to a barotropic fluid at the lagrangian level ; see also @xcite for similar ideas .",
    "the lagrangian description of a relativistic fluid that has been used in part i , and which will also be employed here , is the one outlined by brown in @xcite . in",
    "what follows we will not review the features of this formulation but refer the reader to part  i. all details and the thermodynamics are thoroughly discussed in brown s original paper .",
    "the main issue developed and studied in this part  ii , is the possibility of directly coupling the 4-velocity @xmath0 of a relativistic matter fluid to a scalar field @xmath1 .",
    "the simplest way of mixing @xmath0 and @xmath1 in an interacting lagrangian is through the scalar @xmath2 which inevitably involves the use of a spacetime derivative . in part",
    "i we considered only",
    "_ algebraic couplings _ between the scalar field and the fluid s degrees of freedom where no spacetime derivatives are allowed .",
    "this in particular implies that the coupling @xmath2 falls beyond the interacting quintessence models introduced and investigated there .",

    "as an example we recall the fact that the energy - momentum ( [ 030b ] ) , arising from the interacting contribution , is always orthogonal to the fluid 4-velocity , namely @xmath45 .",
    "formally this happens because @xmath153 which in turn is due to the fact that in the derivative interacting term ( [ 302b ] ) the metric tensor @xmath12 appears within @xmath19 only . as a consequence @xmath49 vanishes whenever @xmath154 does not depend on @xmath19 , as one can easily realize looking at eq .",
    "( [ 030b ] ) .",
    "the property @xmath45 is particularly relevant for cosmological applications since it implies that at the background level the friedmann equation is never modified by the interaction between the fluid and the scalar field , see eq .",
    "( [ 029b ] ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the algebraic couplings considered in part  i where this always happens .",
    "note however that both the acceleration equation ( [ eq : acc ] ) and scalar field equation ( [ 031b ] ) do get modified by the interaction .",
    "this implies that the background cosmological evolution can actually differ from the corresponding non - interacting one , though the friedmann equation forces a matter - like evolution whenever the scalar field energy density becomes negligible if compared to the matter energy density , irrespectively of the strength of the interaction . the fact that @xmath45 implies also that the perturbed einstein equation ( [ eq:023 ] ) as well as the continuity equation ( [ eq:025 ] ) are not modified by the interacting term ,",
    "although in all the other perturbed equations deviations due to the coupling appear .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : cosmology ] we have studied some of the cosmological consequences obtained from these models , employing in particular dynamical systems techniques .",
    "one would expect that a derivative coupling would complicate the subsequent dynamical systems formulation .",
    "however , it turns out that the derivative models studied here are somewhat easier to handle than models based on the algebraic coupling @xmath154 considered in part  i. in particular we have considered two types of derivative couplings , labelling them as models  a and b according to tab .",
    "the background cosmological evolution of model  a has been characterized by a 2d dynamical system , while the one of model  b required the analysis of a 3d dynamical system . for both models we found late time accelerating attractors , capable of describing the present dark energy dominated epoch , and possible intermediate phases of dark matter domination .    for model  a the specific case corresponding to the parameter @xmath155 has been studied in depth .",
    "we found that a dark matter to dark energy transition can be obtained for some values of the model parameters and is always described by the ( heteroclinic ) trajectories connecting point  @xmath108 to point  @xmath119 as depicted in fig .",
    "[ xi=-3/2lambda=1 ] .",
    "note that , as mentioned before , point  @xmath108 describes a scaling solution only when @xmath156 , i.e.  when the fluid describes ( dark ) matter . for a different matter",
    "eos one finds @xmath157 , implying that modifications to the standard cosmological evolution might arise if radiation is added into the analysis .",
    "another simple case of model  a is achieved by the choice @xmath158 . as mentioned above , the resulting background cosmological equations corresponding to this choice match the one arising from a particular @xmath159-essence model studied in @xcite . since the dynamical analysis of the @xmath158 case",
    "has already been performed in detail in @xcite , it has not been considered in the present work . however we briefly recall here some of the features and results derived in @xcite which arise as well in the background cosmological dynamics of model  a with @xmath158 .",
    "the phenomenology found in this case is highly rich with different cosmological behaviours that can not be obtained with a non - interacting canonical scalar field . at late times",
    "it is possible to obtain phantom domination ( @xmath160 ) with dynamical crossing of the phantom barrier , while at early times super - stiff ( @xmath161 ) solutions can be attained .",
    "theoretical models predicting a dynamical crossing of the phantom barrier are important to investigate in the eventuality that future surveys will detect ( with statistical significance ) a dark energy eos within the phantom regime . models of such kind obtained within the @xmath159-essence framework , such as the one considered in @xcite , suffer from instabilities at the level of perturbations @xcite .",
    "nevertheless if the same phantom crossing evolution is not realized by a @xmath159-essence model , as in the case of model  a , then the cosmological perturbations might be stable .",
    "this is because , although the background equations coincide , one expects differences in the perturbation equations between model  a with @xmath158 and the model considered in @xcite .",
    "these considerations enforce the motivation for analysing the dynamics of cosmological perturbations arising from the quintessence interacting models studied here and in part  i  @xcite .",
    "considering model  b , it was found that a global accelerated attractor always appears in the phase space , irrespective of the values of the model parameters .",
    "this implies that for this particular coupling late time dark energy domination is always attained .",
    "interestingly one of these attractors ( point  @xmath110 ) , although mimicking a cosmological constant behaviour , is completely dominated by the scalar field s kinetic energy , showing that within model  b late time acceleration can also be achieved without a self - interacting ( and thus massless ) scalar field .",
    "moreover for some choices of the parameters a scaling solution attracting all the early time trajectories ( the ones on the @xmath113 plane ) is present in the phase space ; see point  @xmath118 in fig .",
    "[ 3dxi1 ] .",
    "this saddle point forces the early universe to reach matter domination before switching to the late time accelerated behaviour .",
    "thus for all physically possible initial conditions ( for which @xmath162 , i.e.  @xmath163 ) a transition from dark energy to dark matter is attained at late times , solving in this manner any fine tuning issue . although the presence of a scalar field at early times is expected to be strongly constrained by observations @xcite , the results obtained within model  b are promising and should merit further consideration .",
    "for this reason in sec .",
    "[ sec : perturbations ] we presented and briefly discussed the scalar cosmological perturbations for such model , although a more detailed investigation will be presented in future works @xcite .     of model b of the dynamical system .",

    "right panel : @xmath156 , @xmath114 , @xmath115.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]    to better expose the dark matter to dark energy transition at late times , we consider the behaviour of the effective equation of state for particular trajectories within the phase space of model  b and compare its qualitative properties .",
    "for this purpose , we look at the dynamical evolution of @xmath164 for different choices of the parameters of model  b ; see fig .",
    "[ 3dxi1weff ] .",
    "we see that in this model we always find physical trajectories starting with the usual scalar field kinetic energy dominated epoch and then evolving through a matter dominated phase , after which they approach the late time dark energy dominated attractor .",
    "note that in this case there is the possibility of dynamically crossing the phantom barrier , after which the effective equation of state approaches @xmath112 from below ; see the left panel of fig .",
    "[ 3dxi1weff ]",
    ". however , this behaviour is parameter dependent .",
    "for instance , when choosing @xmath115 the value @xmath112 is approached from above .",
    "note also that a non - monotonic transition from matter to dark energy domination can be obtained , as shown again in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ 3dxi1weff ] .",
    "all this shows the interesting phenomenology present in model  b and suggests further investigations with other similar models .",
    "we might for example compare the coupling appearing in eqs .",
    "( [ 048b ] ) and ( [ 049b ] ) with the one usually considered in the dynamics of early - universe bubble nucleation arising from first - order phase transitions ; see e.g.  @xcite . in those models",
    "the coupling vector @xmath65 between the scalar field and the surrounding matter fluid is provided by @xmath165 and it is motivated by thermodynamical properties of electro - weak physics , such as the temperature dependence of the higgs potential under renormalization at two or more loops .",
    "this coupling vector is different from the one arising in eqs .",
    "( [ 048b ] ) and ( [ 049b ] ) which assumes the form @xmath166 ( and also retains a quite general dependence are generally free from instabilities at the cosmological perturbations level .",
    "] on the coupling function @xmath33 ) .",
    "unfortunately it seems not easy to obtain the coupling @xmath165 from the scalar - fluid variational approach considered in this work , even if higher - order operator such as @xmath167 are taken into account in the lagrangian .",
    "nevertheless , at a more phenomenological level , the coupling vector @xmath166 can be used to describe new dissipative interactions between the expanding bubble and the surrounding fluid , which might give rise to a different dynamics in the early universe and possibly to new observational signatures of first - order phase transitions .",
    "these topics might well represent future applications of the variational formalism developed here .",
    "finally we briefly comment on the appearance of a `` fifth '' force @xmath168 acting on the matter fluid due to the interaction with the scalar field . from eq .",
    "( [ 997 ] ) ( or equivalently from eq .",
    "( [ 998 ] ) ) it is possible to derive the geodesic equation for the fluid which reads @xmath169 = f^\\mu \\ , ,    \\label{995}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath170 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ 996 ] ) .",
    "note that this fifth force is orthogonal to the fluid flow , @xmath171 , in agreement with the relativistic definition of 4-force .",
    "the presence of a non - vanishing force on the right hand side of the geodesic equation , even for a dust fluid ( @xmath68 ) , implies that in general the motion of matter particles will be non geodesic and that the equivalence principle will be violated .",
    "if the scalar field interacts with baryonic matter , then solar system experiments set strong constraints on the magnitude of this fifth force @xcite , which must then be somehow negligible at small scales .",
    "however since it depends on local quantities such as the scalar field , the particle number density ( or energy density ) and the entropy density , a screening mechanism , similar to the well known chameleon mechanism @xcite , could be at play .",
    "the interesting and original feature of the non geodesic force ( [ 995 ] ) is that it also depends on the fluid 4-velocity @xmath0 .",
    "this suggests the possibility of finding new screening mechanisms for the scalar field which hide its effects wherever the matter velocities are relativistically small , such as in the solar system .",
    "note that this can not be achieved neither with the usual chameleon theories nor with the algebraic couplings of part  i , since in that cases the resulting fifth force does not depend on the fluid 4-velocity .",
    "unfortunately the resulting analysis at small scales is complicated by this dependence on the matter velocities and can not be easily performed following the original chameleon work , as it has been done for the algebraic couplings in part  i. the study of these new screening mechanisms depending on the matter fields velocities , as well as their phenomenological effects , falls well beyond the scope of the present paper and will be left for future considerations .    in conclusion",
    "the variational approach outlined in this work is very powerful because it always allows us to arrive at covariant theories where the background and the perturbations can be studied consistently .",
    "it can also represent the starting point for more radical interactions between a scalar field and a matter fluid .",
    "for instance , one could attempt to identity the scalar field @xmath1 with either of the two lagrange multipliers @xmath21 or @xmath22 .",
    "in particular the first one would allow for fluid s particle creation / annihilation , while the second one would correspond to the scalar field affecting the entropy of the system .",
    "clearly , there is a large number of possible realisations whose consequences and applications could be studied in the future using different techniques , such as dynamical systems and perturbations .",
    "the investigation of cosmological perturbations constitutes the next logical step for further understanding the physics of these models and to better compare them against observations .",
