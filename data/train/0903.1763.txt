    "soft - gamma ray astronomy is a relatively young research field which experienced a golden age in the last decades .",
    "breakthroughs have been achieved thanks to @xmath3-ray satellites carrying instruments such as cgro / egret , integral / ibis and swift / bat whose survey capabilities unveiled the extreme richness of objects in the soft @xmath3-ray sky .",
    "recently , ground - based very high - energy ( vhe ) @xmath3-ray astronomy has also shown rapid progress with important results reported by the third generation of imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes such as hess , magic , veritas and cangaroo . a rapidly growing list of @xmath1 50 firmly identified sources have been detected at tev energies , including agns ( @xmath115 ) , pulsar wind nebulae ( @xmath118 ) , supernova remnants ( @xmath110 ) and x - ray binaries ( @xmath1 4 ) .",
    "in addition , there are @xmath1 24 tev sources still unidentified with no firm counterpart at other wavelengths .    among the different types of tev sources , @xmath3-ray binaries are rapidly becoming a subject of topical and major interest in soft - gamma ray astronomy .",
    "the four firm tev binaries detected so far are systems hosting a bright massive ob star as companion of the compact object , namely ls 5039 ( aharonian et al .",
    "2005a ) , ls i+61 303 ( albert et al .",
    "2006 ) , psr b1259@xmath063 ( aharonian et al . 2005b ) and cygnus x-1 ( albert et al . 2007 ) .",
    "their vhe emission provides evidence that particles can be efficiently accelerated to energies as high as @xmath1 30 tev .",
    "different scenarios have been proposed in the last few years to explain the emission mechanism at such high energies from hmxbs .",
    "some are based on the microquasar accretion / jet framework , with both leptonic and hadronic scenarios . in the former",
    "the @xmath3-ray emission is due to inverse compton scattering between relativistic electrons in the jet and seed stellar and/or synchrotron photons ( bosch - ramon et al .",
    "2006 , paredes et al .",
    "2006 , dermer & boettcher 2006 ) whereas in the latter the radiation originates from inelastic proton - proton interactions between relativistic hadrons from the jet and cold protons or nuclei from the stellar wind ( romero et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 ) .",
    "proton - photon interactions are also an interesting possibility for both low and high mass microquasars ( see romero & vila 2008 ) .",
    "an alternative leptonic scenario for the origin of @xmath3-rays takes into account the region of interaction between the relativistic wind of a young neutron star and the wind of the stellar companion ( maraschi & treves 1981 , tavani & arons 1997a , dubus 2006 ; see romero et al .",
    "2007a for a comparison between the pulsar wind and microquasar models ) .",
    "finally , variable hadronic @xmath3-ray emission could be produced in transient high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) through the cheng - ruderman mechanism in the magnetosphere of an accreting neutron star ( orellana et al .",
    "2007a ) .    in this paper",
    ", we report on new integral imaging data of the sky region containing the two still unidentified @xmath3-ray sources 3eg j1837@xmath00423 and hess j1841@xmath0055 .",
    "our goal is to find their best candidate counterparts , to this aim we discuss their spatial and temporal relationship with the nearby sources detected by integral in x - rays ( 420 kev ) and soft @xmath3-rays ( 20100 kev ) .",
    "3eg j1837@xmath00423 and hess j1841@xmath0055 are two unidentified and peculiar high - energy sources located in the same region of the sky .",

    "it shows a highly extended ( @xmath1 24@xmath4 semi - major axis ) and possibly bipolar morphology in its tev image .",
    "the spectrum is best fitted by a power law with photon index @xmath5 @xmath1 2.4 , the flux is @xmath1 5.8@xmath610@xmath7 erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 ( 0.5@xmath080 tev ) with a corresponding luminosity of @xmath1 3.3@xmath610@xmath10 erg s@xmath9 , assuming a distance of @xmath1 6.9 kpc ( see section 4.3.2 ) .",
    "the extended tev morphology suggests that hess j1841@xmath0055 is the blend of more than one source and to date no obvious unique counterpart has been found at other wavelengths for the entire source .",
    "aharonian et al . (",
    "2008 ) searched for possible counterparts using standard catalogs of sources thought to be responsible of vhe emission , i.e. pulsar wind nebulae ( pwn ) , supernova remnant ( snr ) , hmxbs . by doing so",
    ", they found four candidates each of which could be responsible for at least part of the entire tev emission : the two pulsars psr j1841@xmath00524 and psr j1838@xmath00549 , the diffuse source g26.6@xmath00.1 which is a candidate snr based on its asca spectrum and finally the hmxb ax j1841.0@xmath00536 .",

    "only one of them , ax j1841.0@xmath00536 , is located inside the uncertainty region of hess j1841@xmath0055 : the spatial association is striking being right at the center of the tev error ellipse . on the contrary",
    ", no object has been detected by integral inside the 95% error circle of 3eg j1837@xmath00423 ( @xmath1 @xmath23 radius ) .",
    "then , we looked for counterparts in a bigger error area having a radius of @xmath1 @xmath24 , i.e. almost twice the 95% error circle radius .",
    "we are aware that this is a dangerous approach because of the possibility that unrelated sources could be included , however as pointed out by thompson et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and hartman et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the position uncertainty regions provided in the 3eg catalog are statistical only : additional systematic position errors due to inaccuracies in the galactic diffuse radiation model and source confusion are strongly recommended to the users , particularly for those egret sources located on the galactic plane .",
    "as example , the corresponding counterparts of three well known gamma - ray pulsars ( 3eg j0534 + 2200 , 3eg j0633 + 1751 and 3eg j0834 - 4511 ) are located well outside their 99% egret probability contours ( hartman et al .",

    "moreover , we discuss their possible physical association with the corresponding spatially associated high - energy source .",
    "ax j1842.8@xmath00423 is an unidentified transient x - ray source discovered in october 1996 during a @xmath1 35 ks observation of asca while surveying the scutum arm region ( terada et al .",
    "it was undetectable in a previous asca observation in 1993 and also in a subsequent one in april 1997 , providing an upper limit to the flux and outburst activity duration of @xmath1 2@xmath610@xmath27 erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 ( 210 kev ) and @xmath1 half a year , respectively .",
    "when detected , it exhibited a 210 kev flux of @xmath15@xmath610@xmath21 erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 with no variability .",
    "the asca spectrum is well approximated by an absorbed power law with @xmath5=2.9@xmath280.4 and n@xmath29@xmath15@xmath610@xmath30 @xmath8 ; moreover the most interesting spectral property is the strong iron line detected at @xmath1 6.8 kev with an equivalent width of @xmath1 2.4 kev . in general ,",
    "lmxbs occasionally show iron lines while hmxbs sometimes show significant fe - k lines which do not normally exhibit an equivalent width in excess of @xmath1 1 kev ( nagase 1989 ) .",
    "the overall x - ray behavior of ax j1842.8@xmath00423 is indeed quite peculiar and intriguing ; terada et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2001 ) proposed that it may be explained in terms of a close binary involving a magnetized white dwarf viewed from pole - on inclination . in this case , the unusually strong iron line is interpreted as arising from line - photon collimation in the accretion column of the white dwarf , as a result of resonance scattering of line photons .",
    "such possibility is empirically supported by x - ray observations of some magnetic white dwarf binaries classified as am herculis - type ( ishida et al .",
    "1998 , misaki et al . 1996 ) .    as stated in the end of section 3.2 , the detection in the jem ",
    "x1 significance mosaic map ( fig .",
    "2 ) at ra=18 42 40.8 dec=-04 23 41.9 ( error radius @xmath1 3@xmath4 ) is fully compatible with the position of ax j1842.8@xmath00423 .",
    "unfortunately , insufficient statistics did not allow us to extract a meaningful jem  x spectrum and light curve .",
    "the 420 kev flux was estimated as @xmath1 3@xmath610@xmath21 erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 , i.e. similar to that measured by asca in 1996 .",
    "we point out that ax j1842.8@xmath00423 was not detected in the jem ",

    "moreover , a deeper inspection of the total jem  x1 dataset ( spanning the time interval from 10 march 2004 to 2 september 2006 ) revealed that the longest interval of detectability of the source was @xmath1 5 months ( from 18 march 2006 to 2 september 2006 ) , i.e. a similar duration activity as constrained by asca .",
    "it is also worth noting that ax j1842.8@xmath00423 falls in the much larger error circle ( @xmath1 24@xmath4 radius ) of the ginga source gs 1839@xmath004 ( fig .",
    "2 ) , which is the only catalogued x - ray source present in a @xmath1 15@xmath4 radius circle region around ax j1842.8@xmath00423 .",
    "gs 1839@xmath004 was discovered by ginga about two decades ago ( koyama et al .",
    "1989 , 1990 ) , during an outburst lasting several days ; since then no more x - ray detections have been reported in the literature by other x - ray missions .",
    "the ginga x - ray spectrum was fit by an absorbed power law with @xmath5=1.9@xmath280.2 and x - ray flux of @xmath16@xmath610@xmath21 erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 ( 210 kev ) .",
    "the optical counterpart of gs 1839@xmath004 is still unknown , however the x - ray source is reported in the latest catalog of hmxbs by liu et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , mainly because of the possible discovery by ginga of @xmath1 81 seconds pulsation , although at @xmath1 4.5@xmath20 level .",
    "we think that the hmxb scenario is uncertain but note that the spatial correlation , the transient x - ray behavior and the x - ray spectral shape and flux , all seem to suggest that gs 1839@xmath004 is very likely ax j1842.8@xmath00423 .",

    "we consider such an association highly unlikely on the basis of the following findings : ax j1842.8@xmath00423 is very likely a magnetized white dwarf binary system ; it has been significantly detected at soft x - rays ( 420 kev ) but not above 20 kev ; its transient x - ray activity ( timescale of several weeks ) is significantly longer than that recorded by egret ( timescale of few days ) .",

    "the magnetic field in the crust of the neutron star is given by : @xmath115    here , @xmath116 is the total conductivity in the crystallized crustal region , and @xmath117 is the thermomagnetic velocity that characterizes the drift of the magnetic field under the influence of the temperature gradient .",

    "so , a normal @xmath3-ray flare would have around several times @xmath165 erg s@xmath9 at energies @xmath166 mev .",
    "these @xmath3-rays would be the result of @xmath94 interactions close to the neutron star and @xmath85 interactions in the dense medium around the system ( the column density is @xmath167 @xmath8 and the typical size of a massive binary system @xmath127 cm ) .",
    "protons could be confined by the local magnetic field .",
    "secondary electrons and positrons from hadronic interactions can produce additional radiation through inverse compton and synchrotron mechanisms ( orellana et al . 2007b , bosch - ramon et al .",
    "very intense @xmath3-ray flares such as those detected by egret can result from the accretion of a particularly large and dense clump . during the massive accretion period ,",
    "when the source goes through the transient atoll state , x - ray pulsations are suppressed since the matter is directed outwards .",
    "pulsations are detectable during the quiescent states when the source accretes from the interclump medium .",
    "both @xmath94 and @xmath85 produce neutrons , that can not be confined by magnetic fields and could escape from the system .",
    "depending on their energy these neutrons will decay at different distances , injecting both protons and electrons in the interstellar , dense medium around the binary system : @xmath168 the most energetic neutrons can reach distances of @xmath169 pc . the protons from the decay of the neutrons will start to diffuse into the surrounding of the source , forming an extended , non - variable , @xmath3-ray source through the `` illumination '' in @xmath3-rays of the ambient matter ( e.g. bosch - ramon et al . 2005 )",
    ". the total energy deposit in the medium by these neutrons during a flare will be @xmath170 erg s@xmath9 , which will be transferred to the decay products .",
    "if the duty cycle of the source is a few percent , then , on average , around @xmath77 erg s@xmath9 will be injected .",
    "if particles have a spectral index of @xmath171 , the most energetic particles will interact releasing around of 10% of their energy in @xmath3-rays up to pc - scale distances , sustaining an extended high - energy source .",
    "notice that the protons injected by the decay of neutrons have a long lifetime ( see eq .",
    "[ t_pp ] , and consider an average molecular medium of @xmath172 @xmath54 ) .",
    "the protons can be trapped by magnetic fields inside the binary system or the neighboring molecular clouds , being accumulated through many ejection episodes .",
    "hence , an extended , stable source at high energies can co - exist with a transient x- and @xmath3-ray compact source .",
    "the above scenario is outlined only to show that the association of ax j1841.0@xmath00536 with 3eg j1837@xmath00423 or at least part of the emission from hess j1841@xmath0055 is possible . a more detailed and general model , where sfxt sources are considered as low - magnetized pulsars undergoing sporadic changes to an atoll - state , due to the accretion of clumps from the supergiant companion , will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we attempted to match , from an energetic and positional standpoint , the high - energy emission from 3eg j1837@xmath00423 and hess j1841@xmath0055 with x - ray ( 420 kev ) and soft @xmath3-ray ( 20100 kev ) candidate counterparts detected through deep integral observations .    in the case of hess j1841@xmath0055",
    ", its tev emission appears to have an extended morphology which suggest contributions from several sources ; the possibility that the hess source is the blend of more than one object has been explored .",
    "a search , using standard catalogs of sources which could be responsible of vhe emission , led to four catalogued objects positionally correlated with the hess uncertainty region : two pulsars , a candidate snr and a hmxb .",
    "the hmxb system ax j1841.0@xmath00536 is the only object detected by integral at x - ray ( 420 kev ) and at soft @xmath3-rays ( 20100 kev ) .",
    "intriguingly , this hmxb is located at the core of the tev emission .",
    "we estimated the probability of finding the supergiant hmxb ax j1841.0@xmath00536 inside the hess error ellipse by chance equal to @xmath10.4% , i.e. low enough not to preclude a physical association .",
    "we are aware that the point - like nature and fast transient behavior of ax j1841.0@xmath00536 exclude its association with the entire extended hess source .",
    "nevertheless , our study suggests that at least a fraction of the entire tev emission might well be associated with ax j1841.0@xmath00536 .",
    "to this aim , we presented a theoretical model supporting such a scenario .",
    "it still remains to be understood what sources are then contributing to the rest of the tev emission .",
    "it is largely known that snrs are a prominent class of tev galactic sources : as a consequence , the extended source and candidate snr g26.60.1 ( angular size @xmath1 10@xmath50 ) could be responsible for a component of the entire tev emission from hess j1841@xmath0055 .",
    "pwn systems are also well known tev galactic sources , so in principle the two catalogued pulsars could be high - energy emitters which contribute to the entire tev emission",
    ". however , there are the following doubts on their potential tev nature : @xmath173 ) no catalogued pwne are associated with the two pulsars ; @xmath173@xmath173 ) when taken separately , each pulsar would require an impossible high efficiency ( @xmath1 200% ) to explain the vhe emission , not consistent with the range of efficiencies ( 0.01%-11% ) found for other tev pwne ; @xmath173@xmath173@xmath173 ) none of the two pulsars has been detected by integral in the energies range 420 kev and 20100 kev , despite very long observations , having in mind that almost all tev pwn systems have been detected by integral at soft gamma - rays .",
    "it is clear that the above informations are not sufficient to draw any definitive conclusion on which other sources are contributing to the entire tev emission from hess j1841@xmath0055 , apart from the hmxb ax j1841.0@xmath00536 .",
    "further and deeper multiwavelength studies are strongly needed in order to @xmath173 ) support or reject the tev nature of the candidate snr and the two pulsars @xmath173@xmath173 ) unveil the presence of still undetected high - energy objects ( i.e. pwne , snrs ) inside the hess error region .    as for the peculiar transient 3eg j1837@xmath00423 , to date no radio or x - ray counterpart has been found inside its 95% confidence error circle ( radius @xmath174 ) despite extensive searches in the past years .",
    "bearing this in mind , we opened the search for x - ray and soft @xmath3-ray counterparts to a bigger area , i.e. radius @xmath175 . among the few sources detected by integral ( 420 kev and 20100 kev ) in the proximity of 3eg j1837@xmath00423 , again we identified the transient hmxb ax j1841.0@xmath00536 as the best candidate counterpart based on immediate nearness and similar flaring behavior .",
    "furthermore , such association was supported from an energetic standpoint by proposing a theoretical mechanism able to explain the flaring mev emission from ax j1841.0@xmath00536 . in the outlined scenario ,",
    "ax j1841.0@xmath00536 is a low magnetized pulsar ( @xmath113 g ) which , due to accretion of a massive clump from the supergiant companion , undergoes sporadic changes to a transient atoll - state where a magnetic tower can produce transient jets .",
    "after the collision with the massive clump , everything comes back to the normal state .    one way or another ( association with hess j1841@xmath0055 or alternatively with 3eg j1837@xmath00423 ) , the sfxt axj1841.0@xmath00536 could be the prototype of a new class of galactic transient mev / tev emitters .",
    "additional evidence for the existence of such a new class is also provided by very recent agile and glast discoveries on the galactic plane of several unidentified transient mev sources lasting only a few days ( tavani et al .",

    "further multiwavelength observations of the entire region in radio , x - rays ( i.e. xmm , chandra and swift / xrt ) , soft gamma - rays ( i.e. integral ) , mev and gev ( i.e. agile and glast ) are strongly needed in order to disentangle the emission possibilities , confirm or reject our proposed scenario and find a definitive counterpart to the enigmatic and intriguing sources hess j1841@xmath0055 and 3eg j1837@xmath00423 .",
