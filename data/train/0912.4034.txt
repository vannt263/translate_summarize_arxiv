    "experiments with ultracold atoms provide unprecedented opportunities to emulate precisely tailored model hamiltonians at temperatures close to zero @xcite .",
    "these model quantum systems are not only well isolated from their environment , but also their parameters can be changed in time in a prescribed way @xcite .",
    "consequently , the emerging field of non - equilibrium quantum systems driven out of their initial ground state by a time - dependent hamiltonian is no longer of purely academic interest .",
    "quite to the contrary , it becomes essential for such practical applications as adiabatic quantum state preparation for quantum simulation @xcite and , in particular , adiabatic quantum computation @xcite . in this article",
    "we review recent theoretical work on two closely related issues : excitation of a condensed matter system driven across a continuous quantum phase transition or a gapless phase , and apparent relaxation of an excited system towards thermal equilibrium or a non - thermal steady state .",
    "the former issue had been intensively studied both theoretically and experimentally in different systems at finite temperature including cosmological phase transitions , liquid crystals , superfluid helium , convection cells , superconductors , and bose - einstein condensation , where the excitation is described by the kibble - zurek mechanism ( kzm ) . in this review",
    "we collected recent evidence that , although in many situations many details are different than in the finite temperature kzm , its key ingredients  which are crossovers between adiabatic and non - adiabatic stages of time evolution  remain the same in the zero temperature quantum limit .",
    "consequently , the excitation of a system in general scales with a power of a transition rate .",
    "we also include examples where the kzm paradigm is not so predictive , like when driving the system across a gapless bosonic phase , even though the excitation is still a power of the driving rate , and an example of a disordered system where it is the kzm that predicts a logarithmic dependence on the rate instead of the usual power law .",
    "finally , we mention an example where the evolution is essentially non - adiabatic , i.e. , the excitation density diverges with increasing system size .",
    "once a system got excited the latter issue becomes important : does an excited state of an isolated quantum system relax to any steady state ?",
    "a quick `` global '' answer is `` no '' , because unitary evolution can not evolve an initial pure state into a mixed state .",
    "however , this does not exclude some sort of apparent _ local _ relaxation , where expectation values of local observables relax to become the same as in a global mixed state . with this distinction in mind",
    ", we can further ask what is the nature of the global steady state ? in this article we briefly review recent work on integrable and non - integrable quantum systems .",
    "general arguments together with exactly solvable examples suggest that non - interacting quadratic bosonic or fermionic hamiltonians appear to relax _ locally _ to a non - thermal generalised gibbs ensemble ( gge ) .",
    "the ensemble is strongly constrained by integrals of motion which is this case are the numbers of bogoliubov quasiparticles . in case of non - integrable systems the evidence is less conclusive .",
    "when an excited state of a many - body system after a sudden quench has a narrow energy distribution then , according to the conjectured `` eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis '' ( eth ) , for simple few - body observables the state appears to relax to a microcanonical ensemble .",
    "this thermalisation mechanism is qualitatively different than the ergodicity required of classical non - integrable systems .",
    "even though in practice the two issues can not be always sharply `` disentangled '' , because the relaxation begins already during the excitation of a system , this review is divided into two corresponding major parts in sections [ dynamicsqpt ] and [ relaxation ] .",
    "a quantum phase transition is a fundamental change in the ground state of a quantum system when one of parameters in its hamiltonian is driven across a critical point @xcite .",
    "a continuous ( or second order ) quantum phase transition can often be characterised by an energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state or , more generally , a relevant energy scale which vanishes at the critical point in the thermodynamic limit of infinite system size . consequently ,",
    "no matter how slowly the parameter is driven the quantum state of the system can not follow adiabatically the instantaneous ground state near the critical point .",
    "it is the aim of this part to quantify the level of this inevitable excitation in different systems .",
    "this research is motivated in part by adiabatic quantum computation @xcite , where one would like to prepare a system in a simple ground state of an initial hamiltonian @xmath0 , and then drive the system adiabatically to a final hamiltonian @xmath1 , whose ground state is a solution to a non - trivial computational problem .",
    "unfortunately , since @xmath0 and @xmath1 are qualitatively different , they are generally separated by a critical point , where the driving can not be adiabatic in the limit of infinite system size .",
    "consequently , there is an upper limit to the size of the system ( or number of qubits ) which can cross the critical point adiabatically at a given transition rate and , consequently , the minimal necessary time of `` adiabatic computation '' increases with the number of qubits .",
    "the same problem can arise in the context of quantum simulators @xcite , where the key idea is to emulate a model condensed matter hamiltonian with , say , ultracold atoms in an optical lattice potential @xcite , ions in an ion trap @xcite or nmr molecules @xcite . in this context ,",
    "one usually prepares the system in the uncorrelated ground state of a simple initial hamiltonian @xmath0 , like e.g. a bose - einstein condensate , and then drives it into a correlated state by a slow change of a parameter in the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "a quantum phase transition across an isolated quantum critical point between two gapped phases turns out to be well described by a quantum version of the kibble - zurek mechanism ( kzm ) .",
    "the essence of the mechanism is an adiabatic - impulse - adiabatic approximation , where evolution of a system driven slowly across a phase transition is assumed adiabatic in the gapped phases sufficiently far from criticality , and impulse in a close neighbourhood of the gapless critical point , where the state of the system does not change in this approximation .",
    "consequently , the state after the transition can be argued to have a finite correlation length @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a characteristic time of the adiabatic transition between the two phases and @xmath4 are the critical exponents .",
    "this universal scale of length determines density of excitations and other physical quantities .",
    "for example , the density of excitations or excitation energy above the ground state scales as an inverse power of the transition time @xmath3 .",
    "however , the world of quantum critical phenomena is rich : phase diagrams have gapless lines and gapless phases , and a system driven across a gapless line or phase also gets excited .",
    "it turns out that in many of such non - standard situations the adiabatic - impulse - adiabatic approximation still applies and is able to predict the correct scaling of the density of excitations ( or density of excitation energy ) with the transition time , but there are also systems where this approximation is not practical or not predictive enough .",
    "these include some bosonic systems , which are non - adiabatic in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. , their density of excitations diverges with increasing system size . nevertheless , the adiabatic - impulse - adiabatic approximation is the leading motif of section [ dynamicsqpt ] .",
    "section [ dynamicsqpt ] is organised as follows . in section [ kzmclassical ]",
    "we briefly review kzm in the historical context of finite temperature classical phase transitions , and then in section [ kzargument ] we generalise kzm to a zero temperature quantum phase transition between two gapped phases . once kzm is reformulated in this most `` canonical '' set - up its key ingredient , which is the adiabatic - impulse - adiabatic approximation ,",
    "can be bend and twisted in many different ways as required by actual application .",
    "some general examples are described in sections [ kzadiab ] , [ halfkz ] , [ kzinspace ] , [ kzinhom ] , and [ non - linear ] . in section [ kzadiab ]",
    "we drive a finite system across the critical value of the parameter in its hamiltonian and estimate how slow the driving rate has to be for the transition to be adiabatic . in section [ halfkz ]",
    "we drive an infinite system into a gapped phase starting exactly at a critical point . in section [ kzinspace ]",
    "a quantum phase transition takes place not in time but in space , i.e. , the parameter in the hamiltonian driving the transition is time - independent but inhomogeneous in space , so that different parts of the system are in different phases . in section [ kzinhom ] the phase transition is driven in an inhomogeneous way such that some parts of the system cross the critical point earlier than the other .",
    "the inhomogeneous transition turns out to be a way to suppress excitations at the critical point .",
    "another way to minimise excitations is a transition with a non - linear time - dependence of the driving parameter considered in section [ non - linear ] .",
    "after this incomplete review of non - standard generalisations , we return to the basics and in sections [ lzvkz],[lzvkz2],[lzargument ] investigate relations between kzm and the landau - zener ( lz ) model of level anti - crossing @xcite .",
    "we begin in section [ lzvkz ] by a review of the standard lz model together with more exotic transitions that begin or end at the anti - crossing centre . in section [ lzvkz2 ]",
    "we apply the adiabatic - impulse - adiabatic approximation , which is central to kzm , to obtain approximate solutions of the lz model in some limits of parameters .",
    "finally , in section [ kzargument ] we consider a general quadratic fermionic hamiltonian which can be mapped to sets of independent lz transitions .",
    "this class of integrable models provides exact solutions supporting kzm or its generalisations . in the following section [ argumentpolkovnikov ] we rederive kzm within the time - dependent perturbation theory",
    "this perturbative treatment reproduces approximately the exact results in the integrable models , but it does not seem limited to the quadratic hamiltonians .",
    "section [ argumentpolkovnikov ] completes the general part of section [ dynamicsqpt ] , and the following sections describe applications of the general ideas to a number of specific integrable and non - integrable models .",
    "the list of examples is opened in section [ kzising ] by one of the cornerstones of the theory of quantum phase transitions  the integrable quantum ising chain in transverse magnetic field .",
    "it has a quantum phase transition between two gapped phases : paramagnetic and ferromagnetic .",
    "since the model can be mapped via the jordan - wigner transformation @xcite to a quadratic fermionic hamiltonian , virtually all the general ideas mentioned above are illustrated in the subsections of section [ kzising ] .",
    "this is why the quantum ising chain takes relatively large portion of this article .",
    "once the review of the ising chain is completed , in sections [ subsectionmulticritical ] and [ quenchkitaev ] we review another two quadratic fermionic systems : the xy spin chain and the 2d kitaev model .",
    "they provide exactly solvable examples where kzm requires careful generalisation to obtain correct scaling of the density of excitations with the transition rate .",
    "the next example in section [ randomising ] is the random quantum ising chain , where the density of excitations turns out to be a logarithmic function of the transition rate .",
    "there is no usual kz power - law scaling in this model , but the logarithmic dependence can still be obtained from the adiabatic - impulse - adiabatic approximation like in kzm .",
    "this example is followed by topological insulators in section [ topological ] , where the edge zero modes that must exist in a topological insulator have a different scaling of the excitation probability than in the bulk of the same insulator . in section [ quenchlmg ] the quantum kzm",
    "is extended to the lipkin - meshkov - glick model with infinite coordination number , and in section [ kzinbh ] to the non - integrable bose - hubbard model .",
    "the last model is important because it is another cornerstone of the theory of quantum phase transitions and it was realised experimentally in refs . @xcite .",
    "the 1d version of the model has the berezinski - kosterlitz - thouless transition between the gapped mott insulator and gapless superfluid . since the model is non - integrable , we review different approximate results for transitions between the two phases .",
    "another closely related model is considered in section [ sinusgordon ] , where a quasi-1d gas of bosonic atoms is loaded into an optical lattice potential .",
    "the gas is a gapless ( critical ) luttinger liquid for which a weak optical lattice potential is a relevant perturbation leading to an effective sine - gordon model with a finite gap in its excitation spectrum .",
    "this is an example of a transition starting at a critical point and going into a gapped phase introduced in section [ halfkz ] . in section [ ferrokz ]",
    "we review mean - field treatment of the transition from a paramagnetic to a ferromagnetic phase in a spin-1 bose - einstein condensate .",
    "finally , in section [ sweep ] we consider adiabatic sweep across a gapless phase in a quadratic model of harmonic oscillators , and in section [ manylz ] a semiclassical treatment of a many - body landau - zener model .",
    "the 1d gapless harmonic model turns out to be non - adiabatic in a sense that its density of excitations increases with the system size .",
    "the many - body lz model is in turn an example , where the density of lz anti - crossings is so large that they can not be treated as independent transitions , so the whole problem has to be and can be treated by semiclassical methods .",
    "a summary of section [ dynamicsqpt ] is made in section [ summary1 ] .",
    "phase transition is a fundamental change in the state of a system when one of its parameters passes through the critical point . in a second order phase transition ,",
    "the fundamental change is continuous and the critical point is characterised by divergent correlation length and relaxation time .",
    "this critical slowing down implies that no matter how slowly a system is driven across the transition , its evolution can not be adiabatic close to the critical point . as a result , ordering of the state after a transition from a disordered symmetric phase to an ordered broken symmetry phase is not perfect : the state is a mosaic of ordered domains whose finite size @xmath5 depends on the rate of the transition .",
    "this scenario was first described in the cosmological context by kibble @xcite who appealed to relativistic causality to set the size of the domains .",
    "the dynamical mechanism relevant for second order phase transitions was proposed by zurek @xcite and it is briefly as follows .",
    "a dimensionless distance from the critical point at a finite temperature @xmath6 can be defined as  =  .",
    "[ epsilont ] in the initial symmetric phase above @xmath6 there are finite thermal fluctuations of the order parameter with diverging correlation length  ~  ||^-   [ xifinitet ] and relaxation time  ~  ^z   [ taut ] describing reaction time of the system to external perturbations . this divergent relaxation time becomes infinitely slow at the critical point .",
    "the system can be driven below @xmath6 either directly by cooling , or by increasing @xmath6 above a constant @xmath7 by varying another parameter such as pressure @xcite . in any case , there is a time - dependent @xmath8 running continuously from an initial @xmath9 to a final @xmath10 .",
    "near the critical point it can be linearised as ( t )  -  , where the coefficient @xmath3 can be identified as a `` quench time '' .",
    "this linearised form implies a relative transition rate @xmath11 which diverges near the critical point .",
    "the evolution of the system with a time - dependent @xmath8 can be divided into three stages , see fig .",
    "[ figkzm ] . initially the transition rate is slower than the relaxation time @xmath12 and the system adiabatically follows the instantaneous state of thermal equilibrium for current @xmath8 .",
    "this adiabatic stage lasts until @xmath13 when the transition rate @xmath14 equals the instantaneous relaxation rate @xmath15 of the system and long wavelength fluctuations begin to go out of equilibrium .",
    "after @xmath16 reactions of the system are too sluggish to follow the varying @xmath8 and , in a first impulse approximation , the state does not change until @xmath17 when the reactions of the system become faster than the transition rate again . in this way the system arrives at @xmath17 , which is already in the symmetry broken phase , still remaining in the state of thermal equilibrium at the @xmath18 in the symmetric phase , where there are small thermal fluctuations of the order parameter with a finite correlation length  ~  ^-  ~  _ q^  .",
    "[ hatxit ] these small fluctuations are the initial state for the last adiabatic stage of the evolution after @xmath17 .    around @xmath17",
    "the system `` realises '' at last that zero order parameter is no longer its state of equilibrium .",

    "the small fluctuations of the order parameter with wave lengths longer than the healing length @xmath5 blow up quasi - exponentially in time until magnitude of the order parameter becomes comparable to its finite equilibrium value . at this point",

    "the orientation of the order parameter is approximately constant in each domain , but uncorrelated between different domains .    in the finite temperature context",
    "the focus was on topological defects .",
    "when a vacuum manifold of the order parameter has a non - trivial homotopy group , then there are stable topological defects .",
    "their density after a transition is set by the size @xmath5 of the correlated domains @xcite .",
    "for example , the density of point - like monopoles in 3d is @xmath20 , and vortices in 2d is @xmath21 .",
    "topologically stable defects are a robust and relatively easy to detect imprint of the non - equilibrium phase transition .",
    "however , most of them are not permanent because , for instance , pairs of vortices with opposite winding number attract each other and annihilate .",
    "this equilibration process , known as phase ordering kinetics @xcite , leads to gradual coarse - graining of the order parameter on increasing scale of length .",
    "what eventually remains is a net winding number of the initial mosaic .",
    "this is why in the finite temperature experiments one has to prevent defects from phase ordering by , e.g. , stabilizing them in a rotating cryostat @xcite , or trapping them in a superconducting ring @xcite .",
    "kzm for classical phase transitions was confirmed by numerical simulations of the time - dependent ginzburg - landau model @xcite and successfully tested by experiments in a wide range of condensed matter systems including liquid crystals @xcite , superfluid @xmath22he @xcite , both high-@xmath6 @xcite and low-@xmath6 @xcite superconductors , non - equilibrium convection systems @xcite , and bose - einstein condensation driven by evaporative cooling @xcite . with the exception of superfluid @xmath23he - where the early detection of defect formation @xcite was subsequently attributed to vorticity introduced by stirring @xcite , and",

    "the linear quench is effectively a sudden quench between @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the quantitative difference is that in a slow linear quench the effective parameter jumps from @xmath16 across a critical point @xmath32 to @xmath17 is small , while in a sudden quench it does not need to be small just as it does not need to cross any critical point .",
    "the relaxation after a sudden quench has been studied in many different integrable and non - integrable models .",
    "section [ relaxation ] is an attempt to review some well established concepts as well as more controversial conjectures that were formulated in this relatively new area of research .",
    "the first question that comes to mind is what is meant by relaxation in an isolated quantum system at zero temperature ?",
    "after all , the evolution of the initial pure state is unitary so the state can not relax to any mixed steady state .",
    "however , even when the state @xmath442 of the whole system is pure , a state of its subsystem @xmath1016 is in general mixed because the subsystem is entangled with the rest of the system @xmath1017 .",
    "the state of the subsystem must be described by a reduced density matrix @xmath1018 which is in general a mixed state . thus a subsystem can be mixed even though the system as a whole remains pure .",
    "having thus introduced mixedness , we can now attempt a definition of relaxation .",
    "a well defined question is : is there a mixed stationary state @xmath1019 of the whole system such that _ t  _ ( t )  =  tr_^  _   for a finite subsystem @xmath1016 ?",
    "if yes , then expectation values of _ local _ observables , with a finite support in the subsystem @xmath1016 , relax to their expectation values in the steady state @xmath1019 . even though the actual pure state of the whole system @xmath1020 can not relax , it appears to relax for local observables .",
    "there is no global relaxation , but there appears to be relaxation for local observers .",
    "the local relaxation is not the most general way a relaxation of a pure state can be defined .",
    "suppose that we want the steady state @xmath1019 to be a statistical description of a system like , e.g. , a canonical or microcanonical ensemble .",
    "even in classical physics a statistical description is not meant to capture all fine details of a state but only its most `` coarse - grained '' properties mainly because a too detailed description would not be tractable and thus not useful . from the point of view of observables , we expect good statistical description of a state to give accurate predictions of sufficiently coarse - grained observables , but we will not be surprised when a measurement of a complicated fine - detailed observable reveals a difference between the actual state and , say , a canonical ensemble .",
    "the same is true for an isolated quantum system : we expect that coarse - grained observables @xmath40 can relax , _ t  ( t)|o|(t )  =  tr  _  o  , but a measurement of a sufficiently fine - detailed observable can reveal a difference between the statistical @xmath1019 and the actual pure state @xmath462 . in a many - body system , for instance , simple few - body observables may be accurately described by @xmath1019 , while a complicated many - body observable can reveal that the statistical @xmath1019 is not accurate .",
    "thus the pure state @xmath462 does not relax , but its approximate coarse - grained description appears to relax .",
    "having established what is meant by relaxation in an isolated quantum system , we can ask what is the relaxed state @xmath1019 ? a quick and in principle correct answer is : a diagonal ensemble . if a system does relax , then a diagonal infinite time average of its density matrix   _ t  _ 0^tdt  |(t)(t)|  =   _  p _  ||  , [ overlinerho ] is the first candidate for @xmath1019 . here",

    "if a system relaxes to a steady state , then expectation values in the steady state must be the same as in the infinite time average @xmath1021 .",
    "unfortunately , the diagonal ensemble @xmath1021 may be disappointing as a statistical description , because it contains a lot of information about the initial state @xmath1022 encoded in the microscopic initial probabilities @xmath1023 .",

    "the entropy is maximised by a generalised gibbs ensemble ( gge ) ^gge  =  n  ( -_m_m i_m )  , where the numbers @xmath1025 are fixed by the conserved expectation values @xmath1026 . the special case of only one integral @xmath1027 is the canonical ensemble .",
    "however , unlike a classical system , any quantum system has as many integrals of motion as the dimension of its hilbert space .",
    "indeed , we can always choose the integrals to be projectors @xmath1028 on the eigenstates of @xmath328 , or as integer powers of a finite hamiltonian @xmath1029 with @xmath1030 .",
    "with the former choice the gge becomes the microscopic diagonal ensemble @xmath1021 , which may be too accurate to be tractable .",

    "thus , unlike in a classical system , the problem with gge is not how to find any integrals of motion , but how to find a subset of the abundant integrals of motion leading to a sufficiently accurate but still tractable gge .",

    "we briefly review two references @xcite where the relaxation process was studied in some detail .    in the first of them",
    "@xcite they study a one - dimensional fermionic hubbard model h  =  _ ijv_ijc_i^c_j+ u_i(n_i-12 ) ( n_i-12 )  . here",
    "the hopping matrix @xmath1251 corresponds to a semi - elliptic density of states @xmath1252 .",
    "the system is initially in the ground state of the non - interacting hamiltonian , @xmath1253 for @xmath179 , and then at @xmath157 the coulomb repulsion is switched to a finite @xmath65 .",
    "the relaxation following this sudden quench was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite within the time - dependent dynamical mean - field theory .",
    "evolution of two observables , the double occupancy @xmath1254 and the fermi surface discontinuity @xmath1255 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ figprethermalization ] . for both @xmath1256 and @xmath1257 ,",
    "the two quantities pass through a plateau where , as predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the system pre - thermalises in a quasi - steady state , before it finally relaxes to a thermal state .",

    "the horizontal dashed lines in panel c indicate the quasi - stationary value predicted in ref .",

    "@xcite in the antiferromagnetic xxz model ( solvable by bethe ansatz ) and the antiferromagnetic xz model ( integrable by mapping to a quadratic hamiltonian ) , h_xxz&=&_s ( ^x_s^x_s+1 + ^y_s^y_s+1 + ^z_s^z_s+1 )  , + h_xz&=&_s ( 2^x_s^x_s+1 + ^z_s^z_s+1 )  , they studied unitary time evolution of the antiferromagnetic order starting from the highly non - equilibrium neel state .",
    "the order vanishes exponentially with relaxation being oscillatory or non - oscillatory , depending on the anisotropy parameter @xmath29 . as demonstrated by the data collected in fig .",
    "[ figrelaxationxxz ] , the relaxation is the fastest near the quantum critical point contrary to the usual notion of critical slowing down .",
    "this effect can be explained by the gapped excitation spectrum away from the critical point .",
    "the relaxation is dominated by scattering between high - energy excitations introduced to the system through the highly excited initial state .",
    "the gap restricts the phase space available for scattering making relaxation slower .",
    "this leads to increasing relaxation time with increasing gap and minimal relaxation time near the critical point where the gap is zero .    in conclusion , in all models reviewed in this section relaxation is the fastest either at a critical point or close to it .",
    "this is where either vanishing or small energy gap does not inhibit relaxation .     in the xxz and xz models . in both models",
    "the relaxation time is the shortest at the critical point .",
    "( figure from ref .",
    "@xcite ) ]      in this part we focused on the nature of the apparent stationary states long time after a sudden quench with a special emphasis on quadratic models .",
    "dynamics of relaxation to the steady state was only touched in section [ dynamicsrelaxation ] .",
    "this is a non - trivial problem , especially for a large sudden quench , where not only low energy states are excited , but also high energy ones which are not described by any universal low energy effective theory .",
    "this problem should in general be less serious after a linear quench where , despite some similarity to a sudden quench in the adiabatic - impulse - adiabatic approximation , only low energy modes are excited up to a cut - off set by the kz length @xmath5 , and this length itself can be accurately obtained from a universal low energy theory .",
    "however , sudden quenches are interesting in their own right .",
    "after the pioneering theoretical work in the 1970 s @xcite , they became recently the subject of dedicated experiments on oscillations and dephasing of the superfluid state after a sudden quench deep into the mott insulator phase @xcite .",
    "there are integrable models where the time evolution can be solved exactly , like the xy chain @xcite , 1d hard - core bosons @xcite , or the @xmath1262 hubbard chain @xcite , all of which are diagonalizable by the jordan - wigner transformation , but this type of integrability may result in very specific relaxation dynamics @xcite . in models integrable by the bethe ansatz it was not possible to extract dynamics in general , but with the notable exceptions of the richardson and lieb - liniger models @xcite . in view of these difficulties , it is necessary to develop approximate and/or numerical methods such as solutions of the dynamics of field theoretical models at the renormalisation group fixed points @xcite , semiclassical theories @xcite , exact diagonalisation @xcite , time - dependent dynamical renormalisation group ( tdmrg ) in one dimension @xcite , dynamical mean field theory in infinite dimensions @xcite , and other approximate methods @xcite .",
    "recently , new numerical schemes were proposed @xcite which go beyond the standard tdmrg by focusing from the beginning on the dynamics of the interesting local observable rather than a quantum state as a whole .",
    "some of the more universal results in the above papers concerning the final relaxed steady states were reviewed in this part , but the less universal dynamics of relaxation has been only touched .    as explained in the introductory section [ introduction2 ] , it makes sense to define a mixed steady state @xmath1019 even for an isolated quantum system in a pure state , provided that the statistical description is used only for observables @xmath40 that are sufficiently local or coarse - grained .",
    "this observation encourages one to apply the usual concepts of thermodynamics to pure quantum states .",
    "the discussion in section [ introduction2 ] revealed the central role played by the diagonal part @xmath1240 of the density matrix in the eigenbasis @xmath1033 of the time - independent hamiltonian @xmath328 after the quench .",
    "reference @xcite goes further and argues that also for a time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath1263 it is only the diagonal part @xmath1264 of the density matrix @xmath1020 in the instantaneous eigenbasis of @xmath1263 that is relevant for thermodynamics , because any realistic measurement of a thermodynamic observable @xmath40 actually measures its time average @xmath1265 .",
    "the time average dephases to zero any contribution from the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix @xmath1085 , and for sufficiently coarse - grained observables the dephasing may be fast enough to justify using the time - dependent diagonal ensemble @xmath1264 as a statistical description of the actual underlying pure state @xmath462 .",
    "this observation motivates definition of the diagonal entropy s_d  =  -_p__2 p _  , [ sd ] which is in general non - zero , in contrast to the vanishing von neumann entropy @xmath1266 of the underlying pure state .",
    "the diagonal entropy does not change in adiabatic processes when transitions between instantaneous energy levels are negligible and the diagonal probabilities @xmath1023 do not change . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that when the system is initially in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath7 , then @xmath1267 can only increase or stay the same , in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "this and other properties @xcite make the diagonal entropy a plausible candidate for the entropy of an isolated quantum system .",
    "another ref .",
    "@xcite derives microscopic expression for the heat generated in an arbitrary process as the energy generated due to transitions between different instantaneous energy levels .",
    "when the initial density matrix is diagonal in the hamiltonian eigenbasis , then the expression for heat contains only squares of the absolute values of the evolution operator which can be interpreted as transition probabilities between instantaneous energy levels .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that when the initial density matrix is passive , i.e. its diagonal elements @xmath1023 decrease with increasing eigenenergy , then the heat is non - negative .",
    "a closely related issue is considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a probability distribution @xmath1268 is derived for a work @xmath844 done in an instantaneous quench starting at the critical point of a quantum critical system . for instance , in the quantum ising chain , a small sudden quench from the critical transverse magnetic field @xmath307 to a nearby @xmath1269 does a work @xmath844 with the gamma distribution p(w )  w^(g/2)^2 - 1e^-w  .",
    "this distribution exhibits an interesting edge singularity with the exponent @xmath1270 depending on the size @xmath1271 of the quench .",
    "certainly , a lot of interesting research could be done along these lines and those of ref .",
    "@xcite especially in the context of the jarzynski theorem @xcite .",
    "another reference @xcite considers spin susceptibility in a sudden quench of the transverse field @xmath27 in the quantum ising chain . after the field is instantaneously switched from an initial @xmath1127 to a final @xmath1129 the transverse magnetisation relaxes locally to a stationary value @xmath1272 .",
    "one can define susceptibility to the initial field as @xmath1273 .",
    "exact calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite show , among other things , that close to the criticality , when @xmath1274 , the quench susceptibility has a logarithmic divergence ( g_i , g_f )  -|g_i-1|  +  f(g_f )  , where @xmath1275 is independent of @xmath1127 .",
    "notice that the divergent susceptibility probes not only the ground state , which is known to undergo drastic changes at a quantum critical point , but also the excited states .",
    "these are but a few examples which did not quite fit into the main story of section [ relaxation ] , but which demonstrate that the subject is far from closed and we can expect exciting new developments in the near future .",
    "the main open problems appear to be :    * once the non - adiabaticity of quantum critical systems has been well established , we must at last face the problem how to prevent the unwanted excitation in the adiabatic quantum state preparation .",
    "the non - linear quench or the inhomogeneous transition in sections [ non - linear ] and [ kzinhom ] respectively are the first proposals in this direction , but we certainly still need more ideas and more work to overcome this problem . * due to the quasiparticle horizon effect , the entropy of entanglement in the excited state grows linearly with time and makes simulations with classical computers a formidable task . on the other hand , the excited high energy eigenstates render low energy effective theories inaccurate .",
    "thus an accurate solution of the relaxation dynamics in a large non - integrable system remains a challenge .",
    "these and other open problems may require another review in the near future .",

    "<S> the review is divided into two parts . </S>",
    "<S> the first part revolves around a quantum version of the kibble - zurek mechanism including also phenomena that go beyond this simple paradigm . </S>",
    "<S> what they have in common is that excitation of a gapless many - body system scales with a power of the driving rate . </S>",
