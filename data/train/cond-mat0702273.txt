    "it is unclear how an o(3 ) critical behavior might be consistent with this discontinuity . on the other hand ,",
    "the first - order behavior at @xmath0 is consistent with the existence of a first - order spin - flop line . *",
    "the second objection is based on the lgw analysis presented in sec .",
    "[ effective - hamiltonians ] .",
    "the o(3 ) fp is unstable under an _",
    "infinite _ number of perturbations .",
    "thus , an infinite number of tunings is needed to recover the o(3 ) symmetry .",
    "on the basis of these remarks , in 2d anisotropic antiferromagnets in a magnetic field along the easy axis , a scenario based on a @xmath0 o(3)-symmetric mcp appears untenable .",
    "these conclusions are analogous to those that hold in 3d.@xcite it should be noted that in 2d the argument is much stronger . while in 3d these conclusions are based on the numerical determination of the rg dimension of the spin-4 perturbation , in 2d they follow from the relevance of the spin-@xmath174 perturbations , which is an _ exact _ result . moreover , while in 3d the o(3 ) behavior can be obtained by tuning a single additional parameter in such a way to decouple both the spin-2 and the spin-4 operator , in 2d the o(3 ) behavior can never be obtained at finite @xmath23 , since an infinite number of tunings is needed .",
    "since we have proved that in 2d the mcp can not have o(3 ) symmetry , an open question concerns the nature of the mcp .",
    "we shall now show that the decoupled fp , corresponding to a multicritical behavior in which the two order parameters are effectively uncoupled , is stable .",
    "the stability of the decoupled fp can be proved by nonperturbative arguments.@xcite indeed , the rg dimension @xmath253 of the operator @xmath254 that couples the two order parameters in the lgw theory ( [ mcphi4 ] ) is given by @xmath255 since @xmath256 and @xmath257 . therefore , the perturbation is irrelevant and the decoupled fp is stable .",
    "note that a decoupled mcp is always tetracritical , as in fig .",
    "[ tetra ] .",
    "the stability of the decoupled fp and the instability of the o(3 ) fp is also consistent with some general arguments.@xcite at a mcp the exponent @xmath258 describing the critical behavior of the correlation function of the order parameter is replaced by a matrix @xmath259 , see , e.g. , ref .  .",
    "the conjecture of ref .",
    "states that @xmath260 should have a maximum at the stable fp .",
    "this indeed occurs in the present case : at the decoupled fp we have @xmath261 while at the o(3 ) fp @xmath262 .    in fig .",
    "[ hau ] we show a plausible phase diagram , with three transition lines : a spin - flop first - order transition line , an ising and a kt critical line .",

    "[ haublob ] :    * fig .",
    "[ haublob ] ( a ) presents a bicritical point , which may be associated with a stable biconal fp , whose attraction domain is in the bicritical region of the bare parameters of the lgw @xmath11 theory .",
    "we should say that we do not have any evidence for the existence of such a fp . * in fig .",
    "[ haublob ] ( b ) we show a tetracritical point , where the ising and kt lines intersect each other . in this case the mcp may be controlled by the stable decoupled fp discussed above . * in fig .",
    "[ haublob ] ( c ) the transition at the mcp is of first order . starting from the mcp , the first - order transitions extend up to tricritical points , where the ising and the kt critical lines start .",
