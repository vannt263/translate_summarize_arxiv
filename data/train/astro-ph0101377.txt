    "activity - related phenomena ( e.g. spots or convective inhomogeneities ) can induce radial - velocity variations ( saar & donahue 1997 ; santos et al .",
    ". these can be very important for high - precision radial - velocity planet - search programmes : the resulting radial - velocity signal can mimic a planetary orbital signature and `` produce '' false planetary candidates , as a result of line shape variations ( e.g. bisector changes due to a rotating spot ) .    here",
    "we describe the use of the bisector of the cross correlation function ( as described in detail in queloz et al .",
    "2000 ) as a diagnostic of activity induced radial - velocity variations .",
    "some examples are shown and the main results are presented and discussed .",
    "amongst the stars in the geneva planet - search programmesudry / planet / planet.html ] , some have been found to exhibit periodic radial - velocity changes correlated to bisector variations .",
    "the standard case is hd166435 ( queloz et al . 2000 ) .",
    "hd166435 is a g0 active dwarf which was found to have a periodic radial - velocity signal with a 3.8-day period and 83 ms@xmath1 of radial - velocity semi - amplitude .",
    "although at first the radial - velocity signal seemed to be connected to the existence of a planetary companion , the same period was observed in photometry ( see queloz et al .",
    "2000 , for further details ) .",
    "this lead us to study the bisector of the cross - correlation function for possible variations .",
    "the results showed that the bisector inverse slope ( bis ) was changing in phase with the radial - velocity signal , proving the intrinsic source of the radial - velocity variations ( fig .  1",
    ", right ) .",
    "on the other hand , this technique has been successfully applied to confirm the presence of planetary companions to the solar - type active dwarfs hd192263 ( santos et al .",
    "2000a ) , hd130322 ( udry et al .",
    "2000 ) and hd1237 ( naef et al .",
    "2000a , 2000b ) , all k dwarfs .",
    "the case of hd130322 can be seen in fig .  1 ( left ) .",
    "no trend is observed , confirming that the radial - velocity signal is not related to changes in the bisector of the cross - correlation function .",
    "we have analyzed a sample of 14 active g and k dwarfs ( defined here as having @xmath2 ) from the coralie and elodie planet - search samples , having more than @xmath320 high - precision radial - velocity measurements .",
    "for those stars we have computed the bisector inverse slope to be compared to the radial - velocity values .    to test a possible relation with spectral type we have plotted in fig .  2 ( left ) the values of the slope of the relation bis vs. rv against the colour index @xmath4 .",
    "the observed trend seems to suggest that although active late f and early g dwarfs do induce radial - velocity changes by altering the line profiles , later type active dwarfs are less sensitive to such line asymmetries .",
    "that may explain why this latter objects have , for a given activity level , lower radial - velocity `` jitter '' ( santos et al .",
    "however , as it is clear from fig .  2 ( right )",
    ", this effect is in great extent controlled by the @xmath0 of the star .",
    "more data at a given @xmath0 is needed to unveil other possible dependences e.g. with colour or activity level .",
    "stars with planetary companions that were included after subtraction of the orbital solution do appear in the main trend .",
