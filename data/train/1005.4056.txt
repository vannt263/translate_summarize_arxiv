    "cosmic inflation is currently the leading model for generating the primordial density perturbations that seeded structure formation .",
    "according to the inflationary paradigm , our universe experienced an early period of accelerated expansion , which solved the horizon , flatness , and relic problems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the accelerated expansion also stretched quantum fluctuations beyond the causal horizon , freezing them in . over time , these perturbations were gravitationally amplified , eventually initiating the formation of galaxies and large - scale structure @xcite .    in the simplest models , inflation is driven by a single , slow - varying scalar field whose potential serves as an effective cosmological constant . however , there are good reasons to believe that inflation might have been driven by more than one field",
    ". first , many theories beyond the standard model of particle physics  such as string theory , grand unified theories , supersymmetry , and supergravity  involve multiple scalar fields .",
    "second , introducing one or more fields may provide attractive features .",
    "for example , hybrid models of inflation involving two scalar fields are able to achieve sufficient inflationary expansion and match the observed power spectrum of density fluctuations , while possessing more natural values for their coupling constants and occurring at sub - planckian field values @xcite .    despite the attractiveness of multi - field inflationary models , the task of analyzing them and comparing them against observations",
    "is considerably more complicated than the single - field case .",
    "first of all , when there are two or more fields , perturbations in the relative contributions to the energy density ( entropy / isocurvature perturbations ) are possible , in addition to perturbations in the total energy density ( adiabatic / curvature perturbations ) @xcite . these isocurvature perturbations can source the curvature perturbations , causing them to evolve on super - horizon scales @xcite , which complicates the calculation of the density power spectrum .",
    "moreover , the isocurvature perturbations themselves give rise to their own power spectrum and potentially also a correlated cross spectrum , as was first recognized by @xcite . finally , multi - field models are accompanied by an uncountable number of initial conditions .",
    "since initial conditions may affect the power spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ) , this complicates testing multi - field models against observational data .",
    "it is therefore important to develop a complete framework that takes these issues into account and that can be used to test multi - field models of inflation against observations . in this paper , we focus on developing a theoretical framework to intuitively understand and to test two - field models of inflation with non - canonical kinetic terms .",
    "pioneering work enabling the calculation of the power spectra for general multi - field inflation was done in @xcite . for two - field inflation",
    ", a myriad specific models have been investigated in the literature , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "for the general case of two - field inflation , an approximate solution for the metric perturbations was found to lowest - order in the slow - roll approximation in @xcite .",
    "later , evolution equations for the adiabatic and entropy perturbations were found for models with canonical kinetic terms @xcite and for models with certain non - canonical kinetic terms @xcite .",
    "the complete set of curvature , isocurvature , and cross spectra were first estimated for canonical kinetic terms by @xcite and for some particular non - canonical kinetic terms by @xcite ( and was later extended to include second - order terms by @xcite ) .",
    "however , these analytical results were all derived under the assumption that the slow - roll parameters and the effective entropy mass are approximately constant in the super - horizon limit . in exploring double inflation ,",
    "tsujikawa _ et al . _",
    "( 2003 ) @xcite questioned this assumption by numerically illustrating that this assumption often did not hold for their specific inflationary model .",
    "indeed , lalak _ et al . _",
    "( 2007 ) @xcite reported similar problems with inaccuracies when comparing these analytical estimates to numerical integration of the full equations of motion , which they used to follow the evolution of the power spectra to high accuracy .",
    "not using this assumption , a general formalism for parameterizing the evolution of adiabatic and entropy modes was developed in terms of a transfer matrix by @xcite .",
    "this formalism was used to estimate the power spectra in the slow - roll limit in the case of canonical kinetic terms to first - order in slow - roll in @xcite and to second - order in @xcite . also of note ,",
    "there have been more in - depth investigations of the evolution of and the cross - correlations between curvature and isocurvature modes around horizon - crossing for general models with canonical kinetic terms @xcite and for models with extremely general lagrangians in which the entropy modes are not even assumed to propagate at the speed of light @xcite .    in the first half of this paper ( section [ theoretical framework ] ) , we build on these past results by deriving covariant expressions valid to second - order in the slow - roll and slow - turn limits for the unperturbed and perturbed fields ; for the curvature , isocurvature , and cross spectra ; and for the associated spectral observables , in the case of an arbitrary inflationary potential with completely arbitrary non - canonical terms . in doing so , we extend the work done by @xcite , which assumes a particular form for the non - canonical kinetic terms , and we improve substantially on analytic estimates that assume that the slow - roll parameters and effective entropy mass can be treated as approximately constant in the super - horizon limit @xcite .",
    "we also provide new intuition into two - field models , explaining in detail how the general features of the evolution of modes and of the power spectra can largely be inferred from the kinematics of the background field vector and from the curvature of the field manifold . and",
    "lastly , we reduce all two - field models to a set of just a handful of parameters that determine all the inflationary dynamics ; these parameters provide a foundation for comparing the general features of all two - field models against each other . in the second half of this paper ( section [ applications ] ) , we illustrate how to apply our theoretical framework by analyzing four different classes of inflationary models . for each type of model",
    ", we test more than 10,000 different combinations of the initial conditions and a characteristic lagrangian parameter in order to understand the power spectra they produce .",
    "this paper provides the first thorough investigation of the role of initial conditions in determining two - field power spectra , and demonstrates how to rigorously test and constrain two - field models of inflation , using only minimal assumptions about the end of inflation and reheating . though our paper focuses on the two - field case , many of our results are more widely applicable , as in many multi - field models , only two fields dominate during the last several @xmath0-folds of inflation @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ unperturbed equations ] , we present exact and approximate expressions for the background equations of motion , develop a framework for understanding the background kinematics , and we introduce a new approximation that we call the `` slow - turn '' approximation . in section [ perturbed equations",
    "] , we derive evolution equations for the perturbations in both the given and kinematical bases , and we find super - horizon solutions for the adiabatic / curvature and entropic / isocurvature modes . in tandem , we discuss how the evolution of modes can be inferred from the background field kinematics and the field manifold .",
    "we also explain why previous approaches based on assuming the slow - roll parameters and effective entropy mass are approximately constant in the super - horizon limit often lead to substantial inaccuracies in estimating the power spectra .",
    "thereafter , we find simple expressions for the power spectra , spectral indices , and other observables in section [ power spectra ] . we discuss how the general features and the relative sizes of these spectra can be inferred from the background field kinematics and the field manifold , and we discuss when two - field models are effectively equivalent to single - field models . in section [ applications ] , we apply our theoretical framework to four general classes of inflationary models .",
    "we vary both the initial conditions and a characteristic parameter of the lagrangian to understand what sorts of kinematical behaviors , power spectra , and spectral observables each class of models can produce .",
    "we use these results to test these models against observations .",
    "we conclude this paper by discussing the general implications for constraining two - field models using observational data .",
    "in section [ background equations ] , we present the background equations of motion for an arbitrary two - field inflationary potential with arbitrary non - canonical kinetic terms . to simplify the equations , we use covariant vector notation and use the number of @xmath0-folds , @xmath2 , as our time variable . in section [ kinematics ] , we present a framework for understanding the kinematics of the background field vector .",
    "this framework is very powerful , as it will later allow us to formulate a measure of multi - field effects , to predict the behavior of the field perturbations , and to connect the power spectra to certain features of the inflationary lagrangian . in section [ sra and sta ]",
    ", we use this kinematical framework to generalize the single - field slow - roll approximation to two - field inflation , dividing it into a slow - roll approximation and a separate `` slow - turn '' approximation .",
    "this new distinction is important because , as we show later , the `` rolling '' and `` turning '' behavior of the background field vector have different effects on the field perturbations and hence the power spectra .",
    "we conclude section [ sra and sta ] by presenting covariant first- and second - order approximations to the background equations .",

    "we investigate inflationary scenarios driven by two scalar fields , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 .",

    "we call @xmath11 the field metric , and it can be viewed as inducing a field manifold . if the kinetic terms are canonical , then @xmath12 , and the field manifold reduces to euclidean space . in this paper , we allow both the field metric and the inflationary potential to be completely arbitrary .",
    "we refer to any specific combination of a field metric and an inflationary potential as the _ inflationary lagrangian _ , or equivalently , the _ inflationary model_.",
    "before we present the background equations of motion , we introduce some notation .",
    "since we will be taking derivatives with respect to both the spacetime coordinates and the fields , we use greek indices to represent quantities related to the spacetimes coordinates , @xmath13 , and latin indices to represent quantities related to the fields , @xmath5 . to denote the fields more compactly , we use boldface vector notation , i.e. , @xmath14 and we call @xmath15 the field vector for short .",
    "note that despite calling @xmath15 the field vector , the fields themselves do not transform as vectors , but rather they represent coordinates on the field manifold .",
    "for true vectorial quantities lying in the tangent and co - tangent bundles of the field manifold , we also use boldface vector notation .",
    "in addition , we use standard inner product notation .",
    "the inner product of two vectors @xmath16 and @xmath17 is @xmath18 and the norm of a vector @xmath16 is @xmath19 on a naturally contravariant or covariant vector to denote its dual , e.g. , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we use this set of vector notation both for compactness and so that the background equations presented here can be applied to an arbitrary number of fields .",
    "now we summarize the key background equations for multi - field inflation with a non - trivial field metric @xcite .",
    "the background density and pressure are found by varying the action in equation ( [ action ] ) with respect to the spacetime metric , which gives @xmath22 the familiar friedmann equation describing the evolution of the scale factor is derived from the @xmath23 component of einstein s equations , which yields @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the hubble parameter and where the reduced planck mass , @xmath26 , has been set equal to one .",
    "the equation of motion for the field vector is obtained by imposing zeroth - order covariant conservation of energy , @xmath27 substituting equation ( [ density and pressure ] ) into equation ( [ continuity equation ] ) gives @xmath28 where @xmath29 acting on a contravariant vector @xmath30 means @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the levi - civita connection and the covariant derivative , respectively , associated with the field metric .",
    "@xmath34 represents the covariant rate of change of the field velocity vector with respect to the field manifold , but we call it the acceleration of the field vector for short . in this paper , we use @xmath29 and the covariant derivative @xmath35 to make the equations of motion simpler and manifestly covariant with respect to the field metric .    from here forward , we depart from the standard approach of working in terms of the comoving time , @xmath36 . instead , we work in terms of the dimensionless parameter @xmath2 , which represents the logarithmic growth of the scale factor and is related to @xmath36 by @xmath37 sasaki and tanaka @xcite were the first to repeatedly use @xmath2 as the time variable in their equations of motion and to recognize its advantages",
    ". our three primary reasons for using @xmath2 are    1 .   because @xmath2 represents the number of @xmath0-foldings of the scale factor , it is more directly linked to observables ; 2 .",
    "it simplifies both the background and perturbed equations of motion ; and 3 .",
    "it makes the equations of motion dimensionless ( since @xmath15 is expressed in units of @xmath38 ) and hence makes it easier to compare the relative sizes of various terms and parameters in the theory .",
    "these three advantages make it easier to extract physical meaning from the equations of motion . in working in terms of @xmath2",
    ", we use the short - hand notation @xmath39 to represent differentiation with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "we now re - cast the set of background equations for multi - field inflation using the time variable @xmath2 .",
    "using equation ( [ n defn ] ) , the friedmann equation ( [ friedmann eqtn wrt t ] ) is written in our notation as @xmath40 to re - cast equation ( [ phi eom wrt t ] ) in terms of @xmath2 , we change variables and use equation ( [ friedmann eqtn v1 ] ) , obtaining @xmath41 to further simplify these two equations of motion , we introduce the canonical slow - roll parameter @xmath42 , defined as @xmath43 which represents how much the inflationary expansion deviates from perfect exponential growth . combining the logarithmic derivative of equation ( [ friedmann eqtn v1 ] ) and equation ( [ phi eom wrt n v1 ] ) yields @xcite @xmath44 therefore , the parameter @xmath42 can also be interpreted simply in terms of the dimensionless speed of the field vector : @xmath45 substituting this result into equation ( [ friedmann eqtn v1 ] ) , the friedmann equation reduces to @xcite @xmath46 similarly , equation ( [ phi eom wrt n v1 ] ) simplifies to @xmath47 where @xmath48 represents the covariant acceleration of the field vector and is defined as @xmath49 we use the symbol @xmath48 in analogy to nibbelink and van tent s @xcite multi - field slow - roll vector @xmath50 , which was inspired by the standard single - field slow - roll parameter @xmath51 .    note that in equation ( [ phi eom wrt n v2 ] )",
    ", the field metric appears both in the first term through the levi - civita connection and in the third term to raise the index of the covariant gradient operator .",
    "therefore , the two background fields in @xmath15 can be coupled through the field metric if it is non - trivial , as well as through the gradient of @xmath52 .",
    "equation ( [ phi eom wrt n v2 ] ) ( along with equation ( [ epsilon in terms of field speed ] ) ) governs the evolution of the fields . to solve this equation ,",
    "the final ingredient we need is a particular choice of initial conditions for @xmath15 and @xmath53 . in two - field inflation",
    ", each potential choice of initial conditions corresponds to a different position and roll direction in the two - dimensional field space .",
    "that is , we can view the inflationary lagrangian as specifying all possible trajectories and the initial conditions as picking one particular trajectory to follow .",
    "the result of this extra field degree of freedom is that the role of initial conditions in two - field inflation is more complicated than in the single - field case .",
    "first , the landscape of inflationary dynamics that can arise from two fields is potentially much richer and more complex .",
    "second , there is an uncountable number of initial conditions and hence trajectories corresponding to each inflationary lagrangian . as a result",
    ", it is possible for two very similar sets of initial conditions to give rise to very different inflationary dynamics .",
    "fortunately , in some inflationary models , attractor solutions may make the inflationary dynamics essentially independent of the initial conditions",
    ". however , in other models , we must be wary that the inflationary dynamics  and hence observables like the power spectra  may be very sensitive to the initial conditions .",
    "looking ahead , this means that it is often not sufficient to test the viability of a two - field inflationary model using only one or a handful of initial conditions .",
    "we mention these complications now because it is important to consider them when finding the background solution(s ) to the equations of motion .",
    "later , in section [ applications ] of this paper , we discuss the ramifications of these complications , and we illustrate for the first time how to incorporate sufficient consideration of initial conditions into constraining two - field models of inflation .",
    "finally , the above equations and considerations apply to finding the background solution for any two - field or indeed any multi - field model of inflation .      in this section",
    ", we present a framework for understanding the background field kinematics",
    ". such a framework will be useful for understanding and classifying the kinematics of a wide variety of two - field inflationary models .",
    "it also helps provide a direct link between the inflationary lagrangian and the inflationary dynamics",
    ". moreover , there are other important benefits of such a framework .    1 .",
    "it allows us to appreciate the _ separate _ impacts of different kinematical quantities on key observables . in the past",
    ", these quantities were lumped together and assumed to be small under the standard two - field slow - roll approximation , hence their separate effects had not been fully explored .",
    "2 .   it allows us to infer how the field perturbations evolve and to predict general features in the power spectra , as we show later in this paper .",
    "it helps us to work backwards to determine what features an inflationary model needs to have in order to be consistent with observational data .    in multi - field inflation , we find that the three primary kinematical vectors of interest are    1 .   the field vector , @xmath15 ; 2 .   the field velocity , @xmath53 ; and 3 .   the covariant field acceleration , @xmath54 , which was defined through equations ( [ d ] ) and ( [ eta defn ] ) .",
    "this set of vectors has the intuitive appeal of being directly analogous to the position , velocity , and acceleration vectors in newtonian mechanics .",
    "the main differences worth emphasizing are ( 1 ) that here the fields are to be viewed as the `` position '' coordinates on the field manifold that is induced by the field metric , and ( 2 ) that the kinematical vectors are manifestly covariant with respect to the field manifold , which may have non - trivial geometry .    for two - field models of inflation , the above set of three vectors constitutes a set of 6 scalar quantities , with 3 scalars for each of the two given fields . along with these three kinematical vectors , we can associate a field basis , where the @xmath55 basis vector points in the direction of the first field , @xmath56 , while the @xmath57 basis vector points in the direction of the second field , @xmath58 .    although we could consider the field kinematics in the given field basis , there is a second basis in which it is more useful to consider the background kinematics .",
    "this second basis is motivated by the fact that the field perturbations can be decomposed into perturbations parallel and perpendicular to the field trajectory , and that the former constitute bona fide density perturbations , while the latter do not . in this basis , the @xmath59 basis vector points in the direction of the field velocity , while the @xmath60 basis vector points orthogonal to the field trajectory , in the direction of @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the @xmath63 identity matrix . because this basis is induced by the inflaton vector kinematics , we call it the _ kinematical basis_. this basis has been used before in two - field inflation , initially by @xcite , and was extended to multi - field inflation by @xcite . to denote the components of a general vector @xmath64 in this basis",
    ", we use the notation @xmath65 and to denote a particular component of a general matrix @xmath66 , we use the notation @xmath67    let us consider our original kinematical vectors , but in the kinematical basis .",
    "first , the field vector , @xmath15 , decomposes into components @xmath68 and @xmath69 . in this paper",
    ", we will not need to use this decomposition of the field vector , so we do not consider it further . and @xmath69 can indeed be useful .",
    "for example , nibbelink and van tent @xcite calculated the adiabatic part of gravitational potential spectrum for multi - field quadratic potentials in the conventional slow - roll limit and found that the particular solution depends on @xmath69 . ]",
    "second , in this basis , the field velocity points along the @xmath59 basis vector .",
    "its components in this basis are @xmath70 , where we defined @xmath71 earlier as the field speed .",
    "lastly , there is the field acceleration , which decomposes into a component parallel to the field trajectory , @xmath72 , and a component perpendicular to the field trajectory , @xmath73 .",
    "we now collect the results of this decomposition into a set of three scalar quantities to represent the main field kinematics in any two - field model of inflation .",
    "the first quantity in this trio is the field speed , @xmath74 , which typically appears in the equations of motion via the quantity @xmath75 ; we use @xmath74 and @xmath42 interchangeably as our first kinematical scalar quantity . for the second quantity ,",
    "we choose the term @xmath76 because @xmath72 often appears in the equations of motion in the combination @xmath77 .",
    "the quantity @xmath77 has a physical meaning : it measures the logarithmic rate of change of the field speed , @xmath71 , and for this reason , we call it the _ speed up rate_. the third quantity we include in our trio is @xmath78 , as @xmath73 often appears in the equations of motion in the combination @xmath78 . the quantity @xmath78 measures",
    "how fast the field velocity is changing direction with respect to the field manifold .",
    "we can see this by considering the rate of change of the basis vectors : @xmath79 since @xmath59 also represents the direction of the field trajectory , this means that the quantity @xmath80 tells us how quickly the field trajectory is changing direction along the field manifold .",
    "we therefore call @xmath78 the _ turn rate_. note that unlike the speed up rate , which can be either positive or negative depending on whether the field speed is increasing or decreasing , the turn rate is always positive",
    ". one can therefore think of our three kinematical scalars as simply representing the field speed ( @xmath71 ) and the rate of change of the magnitude ( @xmath77 ) and direction ( @xmath78 ) of the field velocity .",
    "our three kinematical quantities in the kinematical basis can be concisely written as @xmath71 and the vector @xmath81 , and they are summarized in table 1 .        of our three kinematical scalars , the first two  the field speed and the speed up rate  also characterize single - field models of inflation . but the third kinematical scalar , the turn rate , is necessarily zero in single - field inflation since the field trajectory has no ability to turn in a one - dimensional field space .",
    "therefore , it is the turn rate that distinguishes between single - field and multi - field models of inflation . indeed",
    ", other authors have recognized that the ` turning ' of the field trajectory is the true marker of multi - field behavior ( e.g. , @xcite ) . here",
    ", we are building on this work by formalizing the idea of a quantity that precisely describes how quickly the background field trajectory is changing direction , and we do so in a completely covariant manner that can be applied to any arbitrary inflationary lagrangian , including those with non - canonical kinetic terms .",
    "taking this idea one step further , we introduce a new way of understanding the background kinematics .",
    "we propose viewing the first two kinematical scalars  the field speed and the speed up rate  as characterizing the ` single - field type ' behavior of any inflationary model .",
    "we propose using the third kinematical scalar , the turn rate , to characterize the degree of multi - field behavior in any inflationary model .",
    "this provides an intuitive way to parse and analyze the kinematical behavior of any model of inflation into parts shared in common with single - field models of inflation and parts unique to multi - field inflation .",
    "moreover , with this understanding , we introduce a new idea : the ratio of the speed up rate to the turn rate , @xmath82 , can be used to indicate the relative ` proportion ' of multi - field to single - field behavior in any inflationary scenario .",
    "that is , when @xmath83 , the background trajectory has very little curvature and hence resembles a single - field trajectory , whereas when @xmath84 , the trajectory has substantial curvature with respect to the field manifold , indicating significant multi - field behavior .",
    "we will later show that this same ratio , @xmath82 , also indicates how much the evolution of adiabatic density modes is affected by mode sourcing .",
    "hence , the ratio of the turn rate to speed up rate can be used to signify the relative importance of multi - field effects for both the unperturbed and perturbed solutions .",
    "the full power of this kinematical framework will become apparent later , when we show how it can provide important insight into the evolution of field perturbations and into the power spectra , and how it can help us connect features of the inflationary lagrangian to the spectral observables .",
    "in this section , we consider approximations to the background equations of motion . using the above kinematical framework",
    ", we generalize the single - field slow - roll approximation to two - field inflation and introduce a new approximation : the slow - turn approximation . at the end of this section , we use these approximations to derive approximate expressions for the background equations .    our natural starting point is the single - field slow - roll approximation , which consists of two simplifying assumptions : ( 1 ) the potential dominates the energy density ( @xmath85 ) , and ( 2 ) the field acceleration is small enough to be neglected ( @xmath86 ) in the equation of motion for the field vector ( [ phi eom wrt t ] ) . when both conditions are met , the field is slowly changing or `` slow - rolling '' with respect to the hubble time . and",
    "therefore , by equations ( [ friedmann eqtn wrt t ] ) and ( [ phi eom wrt t ] ) , the potential must change slowly , too .",
    "together , these two conditions ensure that the potential serves as an effective cosmological constant , driving nearly exponential growth of the scale factor .",
    "nearly exponential expansion in turn guarantees a nearly scale - invariant spectrum of adiabatic density fluctuations , in good agreement with observational data .    to generalize the slow - roll approximation to two - field inflation",
    ", we follow a common approach in generalizing the first slow - roll condition , but not in generalizing the second condition .",
    "we generalize the first slow - roll condition as the inflationary expansion is nearly exponential , which can be mathematically expressed as @xmath87 equation ( [ sra cond 1 ] ) shows that the field speed , our first kinematical scalar , must be small for the inflationary expansion to be nearly exponential . just like its single - field counterpart , when the first slow - roll condition in equation ( [ sra cond 1 ] ) is satisfied , the potential does indeed dominate the energy density , which is clear from equation ( [ friedmann eqtn v2 ] ) .    in generalizing the second slow - roll condition",
    ", however , we depart from the common approach of individually constraining each of the matrix components of the hessian of @xmath88 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , i.e. , @xmath89 we also do not follow the other common approach ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which is to generalize the second slow - roll condition as @xmath90 in our formalism , equation ( [ std sra cond 2 wrt t ] ) would be equivalent to the condition @xmath91 the reason why we depart from these two standard approaches as represented by equations ( [ std sra cond 2 ] ) and ( [ std sra cond 2 wrt n ] ) is because they are more stringent than the minimum condition needed to ensure that the potential is slowly changing . also , they lump together and simultaneously constrain two different aspects of the background kinematics  the speed up rate and the turn rate .",
    "these two rates have very different impacts on the inflationary dynamics .",
    "moreover , the two rates may not necessarily be small at the same time , and different approximations can be made depending on whether one or both of the two rates are small .",
    "so departing from convention , we treat the turn rate as distinct from the speed up rate to embrace the facts that not only the individual sizes of the two rates matters but also their relative sizes to each other matters .    instead",
    ", we redefine the second slow - roll condition more narrowly as the deviation from exponential expansion is slowly changing . using equations ( [ epsilon defn ] ) and ( [ epsilon in terms of field speed ] )",
    ", it can be shown that this is equivalent to requiring the speed up rate , our second kinematical scalar , to be small , @xmath92 this less restrictive version of the second slow - roll condition in equation ( [ sra cond 2 ] ) along with equation ( [ sra cond 1 ] ) is sufficient to guarantee that the potential is slowly changing , which can be seen from equation ( [ friedmann eqtn v2 ] ) .",
    "as for the turn rate , our third kinematical scalar , we instead endow it with its own separate condition and set of approximations .",
    "if the turn rate is sufficiently small such that @xmath93 then the field trajectory changes direction slowly , and we say that the field vector is _ slowly turning _ or is exhibiting _ slow - turn _ behavior .",
    "these distinctions between slow - roll and slow - turn behavior are more important than they might initially appear . as we argued earlier , the field speed and speed up rate represent single - field type behavior , while the turn rate represents the degree of multi - field behavior . therefore",
    ", the importance of our alternative framework is that we have separated the limits on single - field - type behavior ( our slow - roll conditions ) from the limits on multi - field behavior ( our slow - turn condition ) .",
    "we later illustrate the full benefits of this disaggregation by showing that these two limiting cases of behavior have different implications for the evolution of perturbations and the power spectra .",
    "table 2 summarizes our conditions for slow - roll and slow - turn behavior .",
    "since two - field models often exhibit both slow - roll and slow - turn behavior at the same time , we call the combined slow - roll and slow - turn limits the srst limit for short .        ' '' ''",

    "notice that when the turn rate is non - zero , the entropy modes source the adiabatic modes .",
    "but when the turn rate is zero , the adiabatic modes decouple from the entropy modes , and we recover the equation of motion for the single - field case .",

    "the latter will be strongly suppressed by the quasi - exponential expansion , and hence generally does not contribute much to the adiabatic density power spectrum at the end of inflation .",
    "as it turns out , the evolution equation for the growing adiabatic mode  both the complementary and particular parts of the solution  can be picked off of equation ( [ adiabatic eom super - horz ] ) by recognizing that the two terms in brackets on the left and right - hand sides of equation ( [ adiabatic eom super - horz ] ) are identical . from this recognition",

    "if additionally the fields are in the srst limit , the speed up and turn rates in equation ( [ adiabatic eom super - horz v2 ] ) can be replaced by the approximations in equations ( [ speed up rate in srst ] ) and ( [ turn rate in srst ] ) , respectively , yielding @xmath176 the same srst expression can also be obtained by starting from equation ( [ delta phi eom wrt n in srst super - horz ] ) and using equations ( [ de_p / dn ] ) and ( [ turn rate in srst ] ) .    equation ( [ adiabatic eom super - horz v2 ] ) shows that in the super - horizon limit , the evolution of the growing adiabatic modes is controlled simply by the speed up rate and the turn rate .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side of the equation implies that the larger the speed up rate , the faster the ` intrinsic ' evolution of the modes . the second term , which involves both the turn rate and the amplitude of the entropy modes , represents the sourcing of adiabatic modes by the entropy modes .",

    "the adiabatic modes evolve slowly . however ,",
    "when either rate is large , the adiabatic modes evolve significantly .",
    "but it is not just the absolute sizes of the speed up and turn rates that determine the evolution of adiabatic modes ; the relative sizes of the two rates to each other also matters .",
    "in fact , the ratio of these two kinematical scalars  in conjunction with the ratio of the two mode amplitudes  determines the relative contribution of the entropy mode sourcing to the total growth of adiabatic modes .",
    "we can therefore categorize the inflationary dynamics in a region of spacetime into three kinds of physical behavior , depending on the strength of the entropy mode sourcing .",

    "the solution to equation ( [ adiabatic eom super - horz v2 ] ) is @xmath178 and hence the adiabatic modes evolve essentially independently . since equation ( [ adiabatic eom single - field ] ) becomes exact in the single - field case , anytime the evolution of the growing adiabatic modes can be well - approximated by equation ( [ adiabatic eom single - field ] ) , we say that the inflationary dynamics for the adiabatic mode are _ effectively single - field_. the second case is when @xmath179 . in this regime",
    ", sourcing must be taken into account , and we say that the scenario is inherently multi - field since the evolution of adiabatic can not be approximated by the single - field equation of motion . finally , when @xmath180 , the sourcing effects are the dominant driving force behind the growth of adiabatic modes . in this limit",
    ", we say that the multi - field effects are strong . again",
    ", this shows how critical the ratio @xmath82 is in determining the relative contribution of the multi - field effects  in other words , the importance of the mode sourcing .",

    "this is a prime example of the usefulness of viewing the speed up and turn rates as distinct quantities that serve as markers of very different physical behavior .      in this section ,",
    "we derive a covariant equation of motion for the entropy modes , as well as approximate semi - analytic expressions that are valid in the super - horizon slow - turn limit . in tandem",

    "interestingly , @xmath42 rather weakly affects the evolution of entropy modes but with one exception : it strongly modulates the effect of the curvature of the field manifold on the entropy modes .",
    "in addition , notice that again the turn rate controls the sourcing of one mode type by the other .",

    "can be neglected depending on the background kinematics and the curvature of the field manifold ; 2 .   showing that assuming the effective entropy mass is constant generally produces large errors in estimating the amplitude of entropy modes and hence in estimating the power spectra ; and 3 .",
    "deriving semi - analytic approximations for the amplitude of entropy modes , which are based on approximations to the effective entropy mass .",
    "first , we examine each of the three terms in the effective entropy mass . the first term in equation ( [ entropy mass ] ) is the @xmath190 coefficient of the mass matrix ( the covariant hessian of @xmath52 ) and hence is an indication of the local curvature of the surface @xmath191 along the entropic direction .",
    "when the @xmath190 coefficient of the mass matrix is positive , as is most typical , this term will suppress the amplitude of entropy modes after horizon exit .",
    "however , when @xmath147 is negative , this term will fuel the growth of entropy modes .",
    "the second term in equation ( [ entropy mass ] ) involves the ricci scalar , @xmath139 , of the field manifold .",
    "when @xmath139 is positive  which occurs when the field manifold is locally elliptical  the field curvature helps to suppress the entropy modes .",
    "however , when @xmath139 is negative  which occurs when the surface is locally hyperbolic  the field curvature fuels the growth of entropy modes .",
    "an example of a non - canonical field metric that always produces a negative field curvature is @xmath167 , which describes scalar - tensor theories in the einstein frame .",
    "the third term in the effective entropy mass is equal to the turn rate squared times a numerical factor between 1 and 2 that depends on the value of @xmath42 .",
    "because of the sign in front of this term , it always damps the entropy modes . in the limit of slow - turning , this term has a negligible effect . in the limit of fast - turning ( @xmath192 )",
    ", it causes a rapid suppression of the entropy modes .",
    "interestingly , a large turn rate is frequently accompanied by a boost in the magnitude of @xmath147 , due to the rapid rotation of basis vectors projecting out different combinations of the mass matrix s coefficients .",
    "now we consider the relative sizes of the three terms in the effective entropy mass .",
    "the size of the ricci scalar term , @xmath193 , relative to @xmath147 depends on the field metric and the potential , so we can not make any universal statements about their relative sizes .",
    "however , if the kinetic terms are canonical , then the ricci scalar term vanishes . also , we note that it is common for some of the most popular field metrics to produce field curvature terms that are at least an order of magnitude less than @xmath147 when the fields are in the srst limit , but this is not true for all field metrics .",
    "interestingly , the ricci scalar is multiplied by a factor of @xmath42 , so its effect on the entropy modes is strongly controlled by the field speed ; when all else is equal , this curvature term becomes much more important near the end of inflation and whenever else @xmath42 is large .",
    "hence we expect the curvature term to typically be more important when the slow - roll conditions are violated . as for the relative size of the third term in @xmath188 ,",
    "this term at leading order is @xmath194 , so based on the arguments we made in section [ field perturbations ] , it is one order higher in the srst expansion than @xmath147 .",
    "this term can therefore be ignored whenever the field vector is slowly turning .",
    "next , since the super - horizon equation of motion for the entropy modes ( [ entropy eom super - horz ] ) is homogeneous , we can consider finding solutions to it .",
    "as there are no exact analytical solutions to equation ( [ entropy eom super - horz ] ) , we explore approximations . in what follows , we assume that the curvature term is the same order of magnitude as @xmath147 , though depending on the model , the curvature term may be negligible and hence may be dropped from various order approximations ; we leave it to the reader to determine when this is possible . now",
    "the most obvious approximation to invoke is the srst approximation applied to both the unperturbed and perturbed fields . under this approximation ,",
    "the third term in the effective entropy mass can be neglected , as well as the acceleration of the amplitude of entropy modes , yielding @xmath195 where recall that @xmath196 and where we have used @xmath115 to find the ( @xmath146 ) component of @xmath197 .",
    "but the above equation actually holds more generally , as long as the background field is slowly turning and @xmath198 ; slow - roll is not needed for this approximation to be valid .",
    "so in the slow - turn limit and assuming @xmath198 , the term which controls the evolution of entropy modes is just the first - order slow - turn approximation to the effective entropy mass , @xmath199 .",
    "hence , equation ( [ entropy eom super - horz in srst ] ) gives us a simple metric , @xmath200 , that we can use to find and compare the evolution of entropy modes across widely different inflationary scenarios .",
    "now in using equation ( [ entropy eom super - horz in srst ] ) to derive an analytical approximation for the entropy mode amplitude , the effective entropy mass has often been treated as constant @xcite , which yields the following approximation @xmath201 _ * e^{- \\mu_{\\perp}^ * ( n - n_*)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we use @xmath202 to denote that a quantity is to be evaluated at horizon exit .",
    "the rational behind this approximation is that as long as the background field vector is in the srst limit , the effective entropy mass can be treated as roughly constant after horizon exit , because like the standard slow - roll parameters , the effective entropy mass is slowly changing . but",
    "this assumption is tantamount to assuming that the standard slow - roll parameters continue to remain roughly constant over many @xmath0-folds , which is often problematic .",
    "( see @xcite for a short discussion of this general issue . ) indeed , with some exceptions , we find that the effective entropy mass changes significantly between horizon exit and the end of inflation , and often well before the srst approximation breaks down .",
    "@xcite noticed this problem in exploring double inflation scenarios .",
    "_ @xcite also acknowledged similar limitations , and hence their numerical analysis used the full equations of motion in order to accurately follow the evolution of the power spectra .",
    "as to the origin of the typically significant increase in the effective entropy mass during inflation , we find that much of this increase can often be attributed to the inevitable large drop in the potential energy density and also in many cases to the rotation of the kinematical basis vectors over many @xmath0-folds of inflation .",
    "the former phenomenon is due to the fact that as @xmath203 increases , the potential decreases more quickly , and hence @xmath147 significantly increases in magnitude .",
    "these findings have important implications . in most cases ,",
    "the entropy modes will be damped more strongly than previously analytic estimates would predict @xcite .",
    "for some two - field scenarios , this leads to rather modest inaccuracies in estimating the curvature ( density)power spectrum , while for others , it leads to unusably large errors .",
    "the size of these inaccuracies often depends significantly on the initial conditions , so it is even less common that this assumption can be used to estimate the density power spectrum for all possible initial conditions for a given inflationary lagrangian .",
    "more problematically , it leads to even larger inaccuracies in estimating the isocurvature and cross spectra , which obviously depend sensitively on the amplitude of entropy modes at the end of inflation .",
    "in particular , this assumption often over - estimates the isocurvature and cross spectra by one to several orders of magnitude .    therefore , we do not assume the effective entropy mass is constant .",
    "instead , we integrate over the effective entropy mass to estimate the super - horizon amplitude of entropy modes , obtaining the approximation @xmath204 _ * e^{- \\int_{n_*}^{n } \\tilde{m}^{(1)}_{\\perp \\perp}(\\tilde{n } ) \\ , d\\tilde{n}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation ( [ entropy eom super - horz in srst integrated ] ) provides a good approximation whenever the background field vector is slowly turning , regardless of the values of @xmath42 and of the speed up rate .    when more accuracy is desired or the turn rate is moderately large , then the following second - order approximation can be used .",
    "assuming that @xmath205 is significant relative to but still significantly less than @xmath147 , the equation @xmath206 where @xmath207 is equal to @xmath208 is the second - order approximation to the equation of motion ( [ entropy eom super - horz ] ) . that is , differentiating this expression to find @xmath209 yields equation ( [ entropy eom super - horz ] ) when equation ( [ entropy eom super - horz ] ) itself is expanded to second - order in the srst limit . in equation ( [ entropy mass in srst o2 ] ) , the second - order srst approximations for the background fields and the kinematical basis vectors are to be used , so that both the unperturbed and perturbed fields are calculated to the same order in the srst expansion . solving equation ( [ entropy eom super - horz in srst o2 ] ) yields the same integral expression as in equation ( [ entropy eom super - horz in srst integrated ] ) after making the replacement @xmath210 .",
    "based on the definition of @xmath207 in equation ( [ entropy mass in srst o2 ] ) , technically @xmath207 is not the second - order srst approximation for the effective entropy mass ; however , we still denote the quantity on the right - hand side of equation ( [ entropy mass in srst o2 ] ) with the symbol @xmath207 to avoid introducing too many new symbols and terms .",
    "our results are equivalent to those in @xcite for the case of canonical kinetic terms and to those in @xcite for the non - canonical field metric @xmath211 .    from the above discussion and approximations",
    ", we can therefore predict the behavior of the entropy modes simply from the background kinematics and the geometry of the field manifold .",
    "when the turn rate is small , the amplitude of entropy modes will be determined by @xmath147 , and we expect the entropy modes to be gradually suppressed ( or enhanced ) .",
    "conversely , when the turn rate is large , then the entropy modes will be rapidly suppressed .",
    "if the ricci scalar term is significant relative to @xmath147 , it will also either suppress or enhance the modes , depending on its sign . in the slow - roll limit",
    ", the ricci scalar term is small , but when @xmath42 is large , then usually the ricci scalar term and the term @xmath147 will be larger in magnitude , so the entropy modes will be more quickly suppressed ( or enhanced ) .",
    "[ entropy modes plots ]    lastly , we illustrate the accuracy of the constant entropy mass and our first - order and second - order semi - analytic approximations for the super - horizon amplitude of entropy modes .",
    "figure 2 shows the accuracy of these approximations for six related inflationary scenarios with different speed up and turn rate profiles .",
    "figure 2(f ) shows that assuming the effective entropy mass is constant after horizon exit significantly over - estimates the amplitude of entropy modes for all six trajectories by the end of inflation , and most often , much sooner .",
    "the second approximation , the first - order slow - turn approximation , provides an excellent approximation for the damping of entropy modes when the field vector is slowly turning .",
    "its accuracy is insensitive to @xmath42 and to the speed up rate , as is clear from its equally good accuracy near the end of inflation for models with small turn rates .",
    "however , when the field trajectory is moderately to rapidly turning , it does not estimate the amplitude of entropy modes as well .",
    "we will later show that the curvature power spectrum is most sensitive to the amplitude of entropy modes when the background field vector is rapidly turning , so this second approximation is not sufficiently accurate to estimate the power spectra in the case of moderately fast turning .",
    "finally , the best approximation for the damping of entropy modes is given by the second - order srst approximation , which produces more accurate estimates of the damping when the trajectory is turning moderately fast .",
    "before we proceed to calculate the power spectra , we need to relate our field perturbations to the quantities whose power spectra we want to calculate .",
    "the power spectrum of greatest interest is usually the spectrum of density perturbations . as a proxy for the density power spectrum , often the power spectrum of a quantity called the comoving curvature perturbation",
    "is calculated instead , since the curvature power spectrum is easy to calculate and the two power spectra are identical up to numerical factors after inflation ends .",
    "we use this common strategy and work in terms of the comoving curvature perturbations and the associated isocurvature perturbations . in this section , we define curvature and isocurvature perturbations , relate them to the adiabatic and entropy modes , and find equations of motion for both perturbation types .    the curvature perturbation is defined as the perturbation in the curvature of constant time hypersurfaces . the curvature perturbation in the comoving gauge , @xmath212 , was introduced by @xcite , and it represents a gauge - invariant quantity . during inflation , it can be shown that the comoving perturbation equals @xcite @xmath213 where recall that @xmath214 represents the gauge - invariant quantity @xmath215 . by contrast ,",
    "isocurvature perturbations represent relative fluctuations in the two different fields that leave the total curvature unperturbed and hence they are related to entropy perturbations . as in @xcite",
    ", we define the isocurvature perturbations as @xmath216 so that the curvature and isocurvature power spectra have similar power at horizon exit .    to find the spectra of these two quantities at the end of inflation from their spectra at horizon exit , we need to find evolution equations for the curvature and isocurvative perturbations in the super - horizon limit .",
    "we start by finding an evolution equation for the curvature perturbations in the super - horizon limit .",
    "recall that we already found an expression for the super - horizon evolution of @xmath217 in equation ( [ adiabatic eom super - horz v1 ] ) . substituting equations ( [ comoving r in terms of adiabatic perturbation ] ) and ( [ isocurv defn ] ) into equation ( [ adiabatic eom super - horz v1 ] ) , we find @xmath218 equation ( [ comoving r eom ] ) is exact in the super - horizon limit , as we did not invoke any slow - roll or slow - turn approximations in deriving equation ( [ adiabatic eom super - horz v1 ] ) . according to equation ( [ comoving r eom ] )",
    ", the super - horizon evolution of the curvature perturbation depends only on the covariant turn rate of the background trajectory relative to the field manifold and on the amplitude of the isocurvature perturbations ; it is insensitive to @xmath42 and the speed up rate .",
    "this matches previous results that the curvature perturbation evolves when the background trajectory is curved ( e.g. , @xcite ) . when all else is equal , the greater the turn rate , the more the comoving curvature perturbation evolves .",
    "conversely , whenever the field trajectory is not changing direction , the comoving curvature perturbation is conserved in the super - horizon limit , just like in single - field inflation .",
    "all of this again proves that the turning of the background field trajectory is the true marker of multi - field effects ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "note the degree of symmetry in the terms in the second and third lines of equation ( [ isocurv mass in srst o2 ] ) : the terms on the third line can be obtained from the terms on the second line by the substitution @xmath226 . finally , to find a solution for the amplitude of isocurvature modes , we integrate equation ( [ isocurv eom in srst ] ) to get @xmath227 where one of the two approximations for @xmath223 is to be used , depending on the accuracy required .",
    "equation ( [ isocurv eom integrated ] ) and the approximations for @xmath223 show that the amplitude of isocurvature perturbations depends on the integral of negative the sum of the effective entropy mass and the speed up rate . through the effective entropy mass ,",
    "whenever the integral of @xmath147 or @xmath228 is large and positive ( negative ) , the isocurvature modes will be suppressed ( amplified ) . also ,",
    "since the effective entropy mass depends on the turn rate at second - order in the srst approximation , whenever the turn rate becomes substantial , the isocurvature modes will also be damped .",
    "as for the speed up rate , it affects the isocurvature modes simply because the isocurvature modes are related to entropy modes by a factor of @xmath229 .",
    "so when the integral of the speed up rate is large and positive  that is , when the field speed has grown substantially ",
    "the isocurvature modes are much smaller .",
    "conversely , when the speed up rate is large and negative  for example , due to a sudden drop in the field speed  the isocurvature modes will increase .",
    "alternatively , we can interpret the meaning of equation ( [ isocurv eom integrated ] ) from a more geometrical perspective : the amplitude of isocurvature modes depends at lowest - order on the integral of the difference of an effective measure of the curvatures of the surface @xmath230 along the adiabatic and entropic directions and on @xmath231 times the curvature of the field manifold .",
    "now we use these results for the isocurvature modes to find an equation of motion for the curvature modes . plugging equation ( [ isocurv eom integrated ] ) into equation ( [ comoving r eom integrated ] ) ,",
    "we finally arrive at an expression for the super - horizon amplitude of curvature modes : @xmath232    to understand equations ( [ comoving r eom integrated ] ) and ( [ comoving r eom integrated v1 ] ) , it is straightforward to carry over most of our separate observations about how the kinematics and the curvature of the field manifold affect the evolution of curvature and isocurvature modes .",
    "however , there is one more complicated scenario that merits further discussion : the competing tendencies of the turn rate and the amplitude of isocurvature modes when the turn rate is large .",
    "when the turn rate is large , the isocurvature modes will strongly source the curvature modes , but eventually the large turn rate will strongly suppress the isocurvature modes , thereby quenching further sourcing .",
    "the net effect is that the curvature modes will increase dramatically but then level off very soon after . interestingly , because the amplitude of isocurvature modes tends to decrease after horizon exit , these sourcing effects have the potential to be even more dramatic if the large turn rate happens soon after horizon exit or whenever else the amplitude of isocurvature modes is large .    now in order to solve equation ( [ comoving r eom integrated v1 ] ) analytically , some authors @xcite have assumed that both the turn rate and @xmath223 can be taken to be approximately constant .",
    "we have already discussed the problems with assuming that the effective entropy mass is constant .",
    "the same problems arise in assuming that the speed up rate , turn rates , and other slow - roll parameters are approximately constant over several e - folds .",
    "so like the constant entropy mass approximation , assuming that these parameters can be approximated as constant has limited utility , as it frequently introduces large errors into estimates of the power spectra at the end of inflation .",

    "since it will serve as helpful short - hand later , an especially useful parameterization of the general relationship between curvature and isocurvature modes was introduced by @xcite and extended by @xcite and is expressed as @xmath234 where the transfer functions are defined as @xmath235 comparing equations ( [ isocurv eom integrated ] ) and ( [ comoving r eom integrated v1 ] ) to the above two equations , we can see that wands _ et .",

    ".    the above consistency condition agrees with the second - order result obtained by @xcite for the case of canonical kinetic terms .",
    "this consistency relation is a potentially powerful tool for testing the validity of two - field models of inflation .",
    "in this section , we illustrate how to use our theoretical framework to understand and calculate the power spectra , and we show how to test two - field models of inflation against observational data .",
    "we demonstrate this by exploring four different classes of inflationary models .",
    "together , these four classes of models cover a wide range of kinematical behaviors and include an example with a non - canonical field metric . for each class of models , we vary both the initial conditions and a characteristic parameter of the inflationary lagrangian to understand the range of power spectra that can be generated .",
    "to disentangle the separate contributions to the power spectra , we present a series of plots showing the background trajectories , our kinematical quantities , and the transfer functions . using these plots ,",
    "we discuss how the transfer functions and the power spectra can be inferred from the background kinematics and the field metric .",
    "thereafter , we allow both the initial conditions and the characteristic lagrangian parameter to vary , and we plot the results for a set of six spectral observables .",
    "finally , we use these results to determine which inflationary scenarios  that is , which combinations of the initial conditions and the inflationary lagrangian  are consistent with observational constraints . to our knowledge , this constitutes the first thorough and rigorous approach to understanding and constraining two - field models of inflation .      in this section",
    ", we provide an overview of our methods and general approach .",
    "we start the investigation of each class of models by first varying the initial conditions , while holding the lagrangian parameter constant , and we determine the effects on the power spectra . because the initial conditions can affect the inflationary dynamics and hence the power spectra , varying the initial conditions is essential in order to test and constrain two - field inflationary models against observations . with an uncountable number of initial conditions ,",
    "this is ostensibly a formidable task .",
    "indeed , though there have been a few attempts to consider initial conditions in single - field inflation , particularly by @xcite , there have not been many attempts to do so in two - field inflation , though one notable exception in which the initial conditions receive more consideration is @xcite .",
    "fortunately , most inflationary models have attractor solutions and/or sampling a collection of initial conditions is sufficient to extrapolate the results to the set of all possible initial conditions . in our analysis , we parameterize the initial conditions via a single parameter , @xmath275 , which is the polar angle for the field vector 60 @xmath0-folds before the end of inflation .",
    "when varying only the initial conditions , the six initial conditions we test for each model are @xmath396 and @xmath397 .",
    "next , we vary a characteristic parameter of the inflationary lagrangian , while holding the initial conditions constant , and we find the resultant spectra .",
    "we choose six representative values of that lagrangian parameter to test .",
    "we do this in order to understand how either the strength of one of the interaction parameters in the potential or the size of a parameter in the field metric impacts the spectra .",
    "varying a lagrangian parameter also has the benefit of extending our analysis to an entire class of similar models , rather than just testing a single lagrangian from that class of models .    to conduct the above analyses , we perform all our calculations to second - order in the complete srst approximation using our semi - analytic formulae .",
    "however , we have checked these results all against exact numerical solutions and find good agreement for the scenarios tested .",
    "the one exception is that the second - order calculations do not reflect any oscillations of the @xmath58 field about the @xmath56 axis , which occur in a very small subset of scenarios .",
    "the effect of these oscillations is to introduce some tiny wiggles into the power spectra , but the full treatment of these oscillations is beyond the scope of this paper . also beyond the scope of this paper",
    "is dealing with the small subset of scenarios in which inflation will end before one of the fields has a chance to roll down the potential  that is , models that consist of two separate inflationary phases separated by a non - inflationary phase .",
    "for these scenarios , we simply set the initial conditions relative to the end of the first phase of inflation .",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite to see how these scenarios can be handled .    to complement the above mentioned analyses of the power spectra , we also plot the the background trajectories , kinematics , and transfer functions .",
    "we do this in order to disentangle the multiple factors that affect the power spectra .",
    "we now describe this series of plots here to avoid having to use plot captions and to repeat the same information several times . for our plots of the background trajectories and the kinematical parameters ( @xmath42 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) ,",
    "we show the results for six different sample scenarios for the time period 70 @xmath0-folds before the end of inflation until the end of inflation .",
    "the gray contour lines indicate the number of @xmath0-folds left before inflation ends .",
    "to depict the two transfer functions@xmath291 and @xmath310we plot the functions from horizon exit until the end of inflation , where the @xmath398-axis represents the number of @xmath0-folds before inflation ends .",
    "we do this for seven sample mode wavelengths : for the modes that exit the horizon 70 , 60 , 50 , 40 , 30 , 20 , and 10 @xmath0-folds before the end of inflation ( colored lines ) . on the same plots",
    ", we overlay the value of the transfer function at the end of inflation ( solid black lines ) .",
    "these lines indicate the value of the transfer function at the end of inflation for the modes that exited the horizon at the time shown on the @xmath398-axis . on the plots of @xmath291",
    ", we also overlay the value of the effective entropy mass ( dashed black lines ) during inflation . for our spectral plots , we plot @xmath399 at horizon exit and @xmath399 , @xmath328 , and @xmath329 at the end of inflation .",
    "we show the spectra for the modes that exited the horizon between 70 @xmath0-folds before the end of inflation and the end of inflation ; that is , the @xmath398-axis effectively represents the mode wavelength . to calculate the spectra , we normalize the amplitude of the curvature power spectrum at the end of inflation to the 7-year wmap + bao + @xmath400 result @xmath401 , where @xmath402 mpc@xmath403 @xcite , which we take to be 60 @xmath0-folds before the end of inflation",
    "this normalization in turn fixes the overall energy scale of the potential separately for each combination of the initial conditions and lagrangian parameter , and hence also fixes the amplitudes of the isocurvature and cross spectra .",
    "after having separately varied the initial conditions and the lagrangian parameter , we end our exploration of each class of models by allowing both parameters to vary .",
    "the mesh size we use when allowing both the initial conditions and lagrangian parameter to vary is 101 by 101 , so we test a total of @xmath404 inflationary scenarios for each type of model . for each of these 10,201 scenarios , we find the six spectral observables @xmath297 , @xmath382 , the isocurvature fraction , @xmath362 , @xmath366 , and @xmath405 , where we define the isocurvature fraction , @xmath406 , as @xmath407 we pick these particular observables because they are among the ones that are most commonly considered and/or that are most likely to be well - constrained in the near future . in calculating the spectral observables , we find them numerically from the power spectra , rather than using our semi - analytic formulae .",
    "the numerical errors are usually negligible , except in some cases for the running of the curvature spectral index , @xmath408 .",
    "lastly , we plot each of these scenarios in the @xmath409 plane , comparing them against the 95% confidence limits derived from observational data . to complement this plot ,",
    "we provide a second plot showing exactly which of these scenarios are ruled by these observational constraints .",
    "the observational constraints we use are the wmap + bao + @xmath400 95% confidence limits in @xcite on the combination of @xmath410 and @xmath297 , which we approximate by the ellipse @xmath411    finally , we note that for our aforementioned analyses , we have computed the spectra and spectral observables at the end of inflation and have therefore ignored any model - dependent processing of the modes that may occur after inflation ends .",
    "what exactly happens to the spectra thereafter is unknown : there are many uncertainties associated with the end of inflation and with the reheating process during its aftermath . since the focus of the present paper is rather orthogonal to these issues  on the impact of having more than one inflaton field _ during _ inflation",
    " our calculations do not take these issues into consideration .",
    "of course , some sort of assumptions are required in order to test an inflationary model against observations , so we have assumed that    1 .",
    "inflation ends abruptly when the scale factor stops accelerating , which is equivalent to the condition @xmath412 , using the exact background equations .",
    "the curvature spectra are conserved across the inflationary boundary , , or equivalently , @xmath164 .",
    "if inflation does not end at a unique energy density , the power spectra are not necessarily conserved across the inflationary boundary ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , in many cases of two - field inflation ( including many of our examples below ) , attractor solutions exist and/or the evolution of the field vector at the end of inflation is essentially single - field , which diminishes any corrections to the power spectra .",
    "so we make the usual assumption that any corrections to the power spectra arising from the transition from inflation to the radiation - dominated era are negligibly small @xcite . ] and 3 .",
    "the isocurvature modes are not completely destroyed by the reheating process , and hence our calculations of the isocurvature spectra and fractions constitute upper limits .",
    "any additional assumptions about the nature of the end of inflation and reheating can simply be appended onto our calculations here , as desired .",
    "the first class of inflationary models we investigate is the multiplicative double polynomial potential with canonical kinetic terms .",
    "we definite multiplicative double polynomial potential to mean all potentials of the form @xmath413 this inflationary potential falls under the general category of multiplicative potential models , @xmath414 , where @xmath415 means that @xmath416 is a function only of the @xmath128th field .",
    "multiplicative models with canonical kinetic terms have the feature that their effective mass matrices are diagonal and hence the fields and field perturbations evolve essentially independently . here , we take the adjustable lagrangian parameter to be the power , @xmath417 , to which the @xmath58 field is raised .",
    "we vary @xmath417 , which we take to be a continuous variable greater than or equal to 1 , while holding @xmath418 fixed at @xmath419 . later , using the results in this section , it will be become evident that we can extrapolate from the @xmath419 case to all values of @xmath418 and hence consider the entire class of multiplicative double polynomial potentials .      for the first part of our analysis , we vary the initial conditions while holding the power @xmath417 fixed at @xmath420 and investigate the background trajectories and kinematics , the transfer functions , and the power spectra . for the @xmath421 and @xmath422 initial conditions ,",
    "the potential is nonsensical if we set the corresponding field to zero , so instead we simply ignore the zero - ed field , and use the corresponding single - field potential for the non - zero field .",
    "we find that varying the initial conditions results in trajectories with very little curvature that are very widely    figure 3 .",
    "multiplicative double polynomial potentials , @xmath423 , with canonical kinetic terms 12 pt varying the initial condition , @xmath275 , with the lagrangian parameter fixed at @xmath424 12 pt    [ mult varycoupling ]    separated in field space , as shown in figure 3(a ) . with the exception of the field trajectory corresponding to @xmath425 ,",
    "the other five trajectories depicted show that one field evolves significantly during the course of inflation , ending around the reduced planck scale , while the other field only slightly evolves during the course of inflation .",
    "therefore , for most initial conditions , one of the two fields will dominate the background dynamics and primarily determine the kinematical parameters .",
    "plots of the three kinematical parameters show typical slow - roll behavior up until the end of inflation . as shown in figure 3(b )",
    ", @xmath42 is largest for those trajectories where both fields dominate , and it is also a little larger for trajectories corresponding to @xmath58 domination , reflecting the higher power to which the @xmath58 field is raised .",
    "there is little variation in the speed up rate ( figure 3(c ) ) , and the turn rate ( figure 3(d ) ) is very small for these models , typically about an order of magnitude less than the speed up rate .",
    "therefore , the scenarios produced by these models satisfy @xmath426 , and we expect the multi - field effects to be small .",
    "these kinematics can also be gleaned by analyzing the lowest - order effective mass matrix .",
    "this analysis ( not shown ) reveals that @xmath427 , which approximates the speed up rate , will always be the largest magnitude matrix coefficient and that the other matrix coefficients will virtually always be within an order of magnitude of each other , except near the very end of inflation or in the small subset of models in which the fields co - dominate .",
    "now we consider the transfer functions .",
    "since @xmath428 for these models , they provide an example of scenarios in which the entropy modes actually grow in the super - horizon srst limit . however , since the speed up rate is positive and larger in magnitude than the effective entropy mass , the isocurvature modes will nevertheless be increasingly damped by the transfer function @xmath291 after they exit the horizon ( figure 3(e ) ) .",
    "the isocurvature modes are damped fairly steadily in the super - horizon limit , but the damping increases towards the end of inflation when both the effective entropy mass and speed up rate increase .",
    "also , the isocurvature modes are more damped in those scenarios in which the @xmath58 field dominates , and less damped in scenarios where the two fields co - dominate due to the smaller difference between the effective entropy mass and speed up rate in these scenarios .",
    "note that by the end of inflation , the isocurvature modes are still appreciable in all cases , as expected when the turn rate is so small and the effective entropy mass is negative .",
    "( except , of course , the isocurvature modes do not exist when @xmath421 or @xmath429 . )",
    "the second transfer function , @xmath310 , is shown in figure 3(f ) .",
    "for the trajectories where one field dominates , @xmath310 increases steadily until the end of inflation , and it is larger as the initial angle increases . for the trajectory where the fields co - dominate ( @xmath430 ) ,",
    "@xmath310 starts off significantly smaller , but increases much more rapidly at the very end of inflation .",
    "interestingly , the more the sub - dominant field contributes to the inflationary dynamics , the more scale - invariant @xmath310 is . in all cases , however , @xmath310 remains less than about 1 , reflecting the fact that the turn rate is so small for these models and hence the total sourcing of curvature modes by isocurvature modes is modest .",
    "finally , we plot the set of power spectra for these scenarios .",
    "the curvature power spectra at horizon exit ( figure 3(g ) ) and at the end of inflation ( figure 3(h ) ) show some variations due to the initial conditions , being more steeply sloped when the @xmath58 field is a dominant contributor to the background dynamics .",
    "but they are close to scale - invariant and lack any substantial scale - dependent features",
    ". the correlated cross spectrum ( figure 3(i ) ) and isocurvature spectrum ( figure 3(j ) ) are both smaller by about 1 - 2 orders of magnitude and are also close to scale - invariant , which is as expected given that the isocurvature modes are still appreciable at the end of inflation .",
    "the two exceptions are the obvious absence of isocurvature and cross spectra for the single - field scenarios corresponding to @xmath431 and @xmath429 , and that the isocurvature and cross spectra are virtually identical to the curvature spectra for the trajectory corresponding to @xmath425 , reflecting the fact that the two fields are co - dominant in this scenario .",
    "these results match what we would predict in light of our analysis of the background kinematics and the transfer functions .",
    "now we vary the power , @xmath417 , to which @xmath58 is raised , while holding the initial condition fixed at @xmath432 .    varying the lagrangian parameter @xmath417 also results in field trajectories with very little curvature ( figure 4(a ) ) . for the particular initial condition @xmath432 , if @xmath433 , the @xmath56 field dominates the inflationary dynamics , whereas if @xmath434 , then the @xmath58 field dominates ; around @xmath435 , both fields contribute about equally .",
    "however , for this particular initial condition , the degree of domination of one field over the other is not as dramatic as some of the scenarios we investigated in the previous section . as before ,",
    "these scenarios show typical single - field slow - roll behavior up until the end of inflation , with @xmath42 ( figure 4(b ) ) increasing as @xmath417 increases but with little variation in the speed up rate ( figure 4(c ) ) . as before",
    ", the turn rate is very small for these models ( figure 4(d ) ) and smaller than the speed up rate .",
    "the turn rate is smallest when both fields co - dominate , but is greatest when one field dominates but then the second field starts to pick up speed towards the end of inflation . as in the previous section , an examination of the first - order effective mass matrix agrees with this analysis .",
    "now we investigate the two transfer functions .",
    "the isocurvature modes are increasingly damped by the transfer function @xmath291 after they exit the horizon ( figure 4(e ) ) , with slightly more damping as @xmath417 increases , with the exception of no damping in the scenario where @xmath436 , where the fields exactly co - dominate .",
    "for the transfer function @xmath310 , its size mostly reflects the size of the corresponding turn rate , since @xmath291 depends more weakly on    figure 4 .",
    "multiplicative double polynomial potentials , @xmath423 , with canonical kinetic terms 12 pt varying the lagrangian parameter , @xmath417 , with the initial condition fixed at @xmath432 12 pt [ mult varyinitconds ]    figure 5 .",
    "multiplicative double polynomial potentials , @xmath423 , with canonical kinetic terms 12 pt varying both the initial condition , @xmath275 , and the lagrangian parameter , @xmath417 12 pt   [ mult varyboth ]    @xmath417 than the turn rate does ( figure 4(f ) ) .",
    "so @xmath310 is smallest for those scenarios in which the fields co - dominate and is largest for those scenarios in which the sub - dominant field starts to pick up speed towards the end of inflation .",
    "the rest of our observations from the previous section on how the behavior of @xmath291 and @xmath310 reflects the dominance of the fields and the field kinematics also applies here .",
    "the set of power spectra for these scenarios shows several similarities to those obtained when we varied the initial conditions .",
    "the curvature spectra ( figures 4(g)-(h ) ) all are nearly scale - invariant with similar amplitudes , but they are more steeply sloped as the power @xmath417 increases , as expected . as before ,",
    "the cross spectrum ( figure 4(i ) ) and isocurvature spectrum ( figure 4(j ) ) are both smaller by about 1 - 2 orders of magnitude than the curvature spectra , reflecting the fact that the isocurvature modes are still significant at the end of inflation .",
    "the one exception is for the trajectory corresponding to @xmath437 , which has a zero turn rate and zero damping of isocurvature modes , so the isocurvature spectrum is identical to the curvature spectrum and the cross spectrum vanishes .",
    "now we let the initial conditions and the power to which the @xmath58 field is raised both vary at the same time . we determine how these variations affect our set of power spectrum observables , and we determine which scenarios are consistent with observational constraints .",
    "first , we consider the three quantities that depend on the relative amplitudes of the power spectra : @xmath297 , @xmath382 , and @xmath406 .",
    "figure 3(a ) shows that except for the very small band of trajectories in which both fields about equally contribute to the inflationary dynamics , @xmath297 does not seem to depend on the initial conditions , but only on the power to which the dominant field is raised .",
    "as @xmath417 increases , so does @xmath297 . by comparison ,",
    "figure 3(b ) shows that the cross - correlation ratio  which also serves as a measure of how much the curvature modes are sourced by the isocurvature modes  exhibits more variation , increasing the more the sub - dominant field contributes to the inflationary dynamics .",
    "the two ridges coincide with the trajectories with the largest turn rates , which correspond to scenarios in which the sub - dominant field starts to pick up more speed as the dominant field ends inflation . to the left of the first ridge ,",
    "@xmath58 dominates the inflationary dynamics , while to the right of the second ridge , @xmath56 dominates .",
    "the deep and narrow gorge - like feature between the two ridges corresponds to scenarios in which the fields are essentially equally co - dominant such that the turn rate is very small and hence the cross - correlation is tiny . only for this small subset of scenarios where the fields co - dominate is the isocurvature fraction large , as shown in figure 3(c ) ; otherwise , the isocurvature fraction is small .",
    "next , we consider the derivative quantities associated with the power spectra : the spectral indices @xmath362 and @xmath366 , and the running of the curvature spectral index , @xmath405 .",
    "the plots for both @xmath438 ( figure 5(d ) ) and @xmath439 ( figure 5(e ) ) are very similar in profile , since the speed up rate and logarithmic running of @xmath310 produce very small deviations from scale invariance , which serves to slightly increase the value of @xmath439 relative to @xmath440 .",
    "the values of these two spectral indices are greatest for those scenarios in which @xmath58 dominates or co - dominates , and they increase as @xmath417 increases .",
    "also , we note that the larger @xmath417 is , the larger @xmath275 must be for the fields to be co - dominant .",
    "as @xmath366 itself does not have much scale dependence , the running of the curvature spectral index is very small and negative for these models , as shown in figure 5(f ) .",
    "finally , we examine which inflationary scenarios produced by this type of model can be ruled out by the 95% confidence limits on the combination of @xmath410 and @xmath297 . according to these limits ,",
    "the single - field potential @xmath441 is ruled out , but the single - field potential @xmath442 is still a viable candidate for describing inflation @xcite .",
    "therefore , whenever the @xmath56 field , which is raised to the second power , dominates , the inflationary scenario is consistent with observational data .",
    "this corresponds to higher values for @xmath351 and lower values for @xmath297 , as shown in figure 5(g ) , and this corresponds to the rightmost white region in figure 5(h ) .",
    "however , when the @xmath58 field dominates or co - dominates , whether the scenario is viable depends on the power to which the @xmath58 field is raised . scenarios in which @xmath443 and @xmath58 dominates or co - dominates are ruled out by observational constraints .    taken together",
    ", these results suggest that multiplicative double polynomial potentials with canonical kinetic terms produce nearly scale - invariant power spectra that are determined primarily by the field that dominates the inflationary dynamics , or by both fields if they are co - dominant , with corrections from the sub - dominant field . as a result ,",
    "the power to which the dominant field ( or co - dominant fields ) is raised determines whether the scenario is excluded by current observational data .",
    "also in these scenarios , the isocurvature and cross spectra is typically smaller , but possibly detectable , if unaffected by reheating and other post - inflationary processes .",
    "therefore , we can view the role of initial conditions in these models , in conjunction with the powers the two fields are raised to , as being to determine the dominant field ( or whether the fields are co - dominant ) and to set the size of the corrections from the sub - dominant field .",
    "the second class of inflationary models we investigate is the double quadratic potential with canonical kinetic terms .",
    "we define double quadratic potential to mean all potentials of the form @xmath444 this inflationary model falls under the general category of additive potential models , @xmath445 , where @xmath416 is a function only of the @xmath128th field .",
    "additive models with canonical kinetic terms have the feature that the given fields are non - interacting , so they interact only gravitationally . here , the adjustable lagrangian parameter is the ratio of the masses , @xmath446 , and we take @xmath447 .",
    "first , we vary the initial conditions while holding the mass ratio @xmath446 fixed .",
    "we set @xmath448 since this mass ratio produces trajectories with moderately fast turning behavior .",
    "the trajectories produced by this model ( figure 6(a ) ) and associated kinematical quantities ( figures 6(b)-(d ) ) depend significantly on the initial conditions and roughly separate into three subsets of behavior .",
    "the first subset of scenarios starts sufficiently close to the @xmath56 axis such that the @xmath56 field dominates the energy density during the last 60 @xmath0-folds of inflation .",
    "for these trajectories , the field vector essentially rolls down the @xmath56 axis , producing typical slow - roll inflation with at most a small turn rate .",
    "the second and largest subset of trajectories consists of those that experience @xmath58 domination 60 @xmath0-folds before inflation ends , but have an initial angle @xmath449 . for these trajectories ,",
    "the more massive @xmath58 field initially dominates the energy density , driving the field vector towards the @xmath56 axis .",
    "eventually , once @xmath58 becomes sufficiently small , @xmath56 takes over as the dominant field , causing the trajectory to turn significantly in field space , before rolling down the @xmath56 axis and ending inflation .",
    "will oscillate about the @xmath56 axis around the time that the field vector turns sharply in field space .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we will not be addressing these oscillations and any subsequent particle decays that arise , but rather simply point out that these oscillations arise as a consequence of the classical background dynamics for certain combinations of the initial conditions and sufficiently large values of the mass ratio . ]",
    "since @xmath58 dominates the dynamics before the turn , while @xmath56 dominates the dynamics after the turn , these inflationary scenarios can be considered to have two distinct phases of inflation .",
    "exploring the kinematics of these scenarios in figures 6(b)-(d ) , we find that as the field vector approaches the @xmath56 axis , @xmath42 increases substantially reflecting the fact that @xmath58 picks up speed .",
    "but then as @xmath58 domination gives way to @xmath56 domination , @xmath42 drops significantly , essentially resetting itself for a phase of @xmath56 domination . during the transition between the phases , the turn rate ( figure 6(d ) ) dramatically and transiently increases , and the trajectory turns significantly in field space",
    "; however , this peak in the turn rate occurs slightly after the large negative drop in the speed up rate . in general",
    ", we find that the larger the initial angle @xmath275 is , the larger the speed up and turn rates are when they peak in magnitude , the narrower the peaks , and the closer these peaks occur to the end of inflation . as this subset of scenarios represents the case",
    "in which the speed up rates and turn rates are comparable around similar times during inflation , we therefore expect the multi - field effects to be substantial .",
    "the third subset of scenarios are also characterized by initial @xmath58 domination 60 @xmath0-folds before inflation ends but have initial angles @xmath450 .",
    "the difference is that for these scenarios , the @xmath58 field picks up enough speed for inflation to end while the @xmath58 field still dominates the energy density .",
    "eventually , a second phase of inflation driven by the @xmath56 field will occur sometime later . as mentioned earlier , these more complicated scenarios are beyond the scope of this work , so for simplicity , we calculate the inflationary dynamics by treating these scenarios as if they consist of only one phase of inflation , with typical slow - roll behavior and at most a very small turn rate .",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite to see in detail how one might handle these more complicated scenarios .",
    "now we consider the two transfer functions @xmath291 ( figure 6(e ) ) and @xmath310 ( figure 6(f ) ) .",
    "for all three subsets of scenarios , whenever the fields are in the super - horizon srst limit , @xmath291 decays gradually .",
    "however , for the second subset of scenarios , during the transition between inflationary phases , @xmath291 varies dramatically .",
    "initially , the drop in @xmath42 ( or equivalently , the large negative speed up rate ) strongly enhances the isocurvature modes , and then the subsequent large turn rate strongly suppresses the modes . after the turn , @xmath341 remains high and the speed up rate gradually increases again , so that @xmath451 for all modes that exit the horizon both before and after the turn .",
    "this is exactly the behavior for @xmath291 that we expect in inflationary scenarios with large turn rates .",
    "the second transfer function , @xmath310 , satisfies @xmath365 for the first and third subsets of scenarios , because of their small turn rates .",
    "but @xmath310 becomes larger than one by the end of inflation and exhibits significant scale - dependent features for the second subset of scenarios .",

    "by contrast , for mass ratios close to 1 , the inflationary dynamics are much less sensitive to the initial conditions and the curvature power spectrum is close to scale - invariant . in general , for these models , the isocurvature and cross spectra are very small , if not completely negligible , reflecting the larger turn rate and effective entropy mass .",

    "this also results in a higher boost in the amplitude of isocurvature modes during the transition between @xmath58 and @xmath56 domination .",
    "lastly , the curvature power spectra produced by double quartic potentials naturally have larger spectral indices , just like the single - field quartic potential .    in figure 9",

    "interestingly , positive values of @xmath475 make the curvature power spectrum at the end of inflation more scale - invariant than the corresponding spectrum at horizon exit _ and _ than the final curvature spectrum for the @xmath481 scenario .",
    "indeed , the flatness of the curvature spectrum for the @xmath482 scenario is remarkable , suggesting that a significant and sustained turn rate accompanied by a significantly smaller roll rate ( an example of the limit @xmath473 ) provides a way of achieving a very highly scale - invariant curvature spectrum .",
    "we also point out that the smaller @xmath475 is , the larger the cross and the isocurvature spectra tend to be , though both are at least a few orders of magnitude smaller than the curvature spectrum at the end of inflation .",

    "the cross - correlation ratio , shown in figure 11(b ) , has a complex dependence on the initial conditions and @xmath475 . for @xmath484 ,",
    "the correlation is small . for negative values of @xmath475 ,",
    "the more negative @xmath475 is , the larger the correlation ratio is , and this is largely independent of the initial conditions . for positive values of @xmath475 , the larger",
    "@xmath475 is , the larger the correlation is for large angles , but the smaller it is for small angles .",
    "these complicated dependences largely mirror the turn rate profile .",

    "now we examine the key spectral indices . as for all the other models we have considered , the profiles for @xmath463 ( figure 11(d ) ) and @xmath439 ( figure 11(e ) ) are strikingly similar . here , the spectral indices are very small , except for more negative values of @xmath475 , for which the spectral indices are moderately large for a significant fraction of initial angles .",
    "the greatest differences between the two spectral indices occurs for models with large turn rates , and hence their curvature spectral index gets a boost from the turn rate and effective entropy mass . for the running of the curvature spectral index ( figure 11(f ) ) , surprisingly , it is small in all cases .    finally , we examine which combinations of the initial conditions and the lagrangian parameter @xmath475 can be ruled out based on observations .",
    "the double quadratic model with a mass ratio of @xmath479 and canonical kinetic terms is consistent with observations . adding the non - canonical kinetic terms in equation ( [ kinetic terms form for example model ] ) makes the landscape of kinematical behaviors and spectral observables far richer and more complex .",
    "combinations of large negative or positive values of @xmath475 and moderate initial angles are ruled by the 95% confidence region in the @xmath466 plane .",
    "the former set corresponds to large turn rates accompanied by large speed up rates , with the result that this causes the curvature spectrum to be too scale - dependent to match observations .",
    "the latter set corresponds to scenarios in which the kinematical behavior @xmath473 causes the curvature spectrum to be too scale - independent , causing an inflationary model that is otherwise consistent with observations to be ruled out .",
    "therefore , the addition of non - canonical kinetic terms provides a powerful way to fine - tune a model , to achieve the right amount of scale - dependence in the density spectrum and to achieve a tensor - to - scalar ratio that is consistent with observations .",
    "ultimately , this analysis , along with other analyses we have performed in section [ applications ] , shows that having the right balance of the field speed , the speed up rate , and the turn rate ( along with reasonable values for the effective entropy mass ) is critical for ensuring that the curvature power spectrum is neither too scale - dependent nor scale - independent and for achieving a tensor - to - scalar ratio that is consistent with observations .",
    "in this paper , we have constructed a complete covariant framework for understanding two - field models of inflation with an arbitrary potential and with arbitrary non - canonical kinetic terms .",
    "we have derived the power spectra to second - order in the combined slow - roll and slow - turn ( srst ) approximation , provided new insight into how the spectra can be inferred from the background kinematics and the field manifold , and we have illustrated how to rigorously test and constrain two - field models of inflation using observational data .",
    "we started by considering the background dynamics in section [ unperturbed equations ] . after simplifying the background equations of motion using covariant vector notation and the number of @xmath0-folds as the time variable",

    "we used this kinematical framework to generalize the standard slow - roll approximation to two - field inflation , dividing it into two separate parts : a slow - roll approximation to represent limits on single - field - type behavior and a slow - turn approximation to represent limits on multi - field behavior .",
    "we then derived first- and second - order expressions for the background equations , and we introduced the mass matrix , @xmath488 , whose coefficients estimate the speed up and turn rates .    in section [ perturbed equations ] , we considered the perturbed equations of motion . working in terms of gauge - invariant quantities",
    ", we simplified the equation of motion for the field perturbations and showed that their evolution is determined primarily by the effective mass matrix , @xmath489 , where @xmath139 is the ricci scalar of the field manifold induced by the field metric .",
    "thereafter , we rotated to the kinematical basis and derived exact expressions for the evolution of adiabatic and entropy modes . working in the super - horizon limit",
    ", we found a simple exact expression for the evolution of adiabatic modes , revealing that the growth of adiabatic modes is determined by the speed up and turn rates , with the turn rate determining the degree of sourcing by the entropy modes .",
    "further , we found that the ratio @xmath82 , which controls the relative contribution of mode sourcing to the growth of adiabatic modes , can be viewed as indicating the relative importance of multi - field effects .",
    "this also has an aesthetic appeal , since the same ratio provides a measure of the curvature of the background trajectory at a given time .",
    "we also found approximate expressions for the super - horizon evolution of entropy modes , which is controlled by the effective entropy mass ( @xmath490 ) . from analyzing the behavior of the effective entropy mass , we argued that assuming the effective entropy mass and slow - roll parameters are constant in order to estimate the power spectra @xcite generally leads to large inaccuracies in estimating the amplitude of modes , even in the srst approximation .",
    "finally , we used these results to find semi - analytic expressions for the super - horizon amplitude of the related curvature and isocurvature perturbations , and we discussed how the general features of their evolution can largely be inferred from the background kinematics and the field manifold .",
    "for example , a large turn rate rate produces strong sourcing of curvature modes by isocurvature modes , leading to a large boost in the amplitude of curvature modes at the expense of a dramatic suppression of isocurvature modes .    thereafter , in section [ perturbed equations ] , we calculated and interpreted the power spectra . to do so , we quantized the field perturbations , solved the field perturbation equation in the three standard regimes of interest , and matched the solutions across the boundaries .",
    "after rotation to the kinematical basis , we calculated the power spectra at horizon exit , and then used the transfer matrix formalism @xcite to derive compact expressions for the curvature , isocurvature , and cross spectra to second - order in the srst limit .",
    "we found that to lowest order , the spectra depend on just four functions ( @xmath164 , @xmath42 , @xmath291 , and @xmath310 ) , which means that all features of the power spectra can be traced back to five fundamental kinematical parameters : @xmath164 , @xmath42 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath188 , which together are simply related to the value , gradient , and hessian of @xmath88 ( along with corrections from any trivial geometry of the field manifold .",
    "we discussed how exactly these background kinematics and the curvature of the field manifold are reflected in the general features and relative sizes of the spectra .",
    "for example , for models with large turn rates , the curvature power spectrum will be boosted and the cross and isocurvature spectra will be several orders of magnitude smaller , with profiles that reflect the scale - dependence of the turn rate , among other quantities .",
    "we also provided conditions for when a two - field inflationary scenario effectively behaves like a single - field inflationary scenario .",
    "thereafter , we presented compact expressions for the tensor - to - scalar ratio , spectral indices , and runnings of the spectral indices , and a consistency relation among them , and we showed how can work backwards to reconstruct the background kinematics from these spectral observables .    finally , we illustrated for the first time how to rigorously test two - field inflationary models against observational data by incorporating initial conditions .",
    "we tested four classes of inflationary models , varying both their initial conditions and a characteristic lagrangian parameter in order to test tens of thousands of possible scenarios to determine the types of kinematical behaviors and power spectra they produce .",
    "the four classes of models we considered covered all three limits for the relative ratio of the turn rate to the speed up rate , both distributed and abrupt rolling and turning behavior , and non - canonical kinetic terms . for our three classes of models with canonical kinetic terms , we found that certain combinations of the initial conditions and lagrangian parameter for the multiplicative double polynomial and double quadratic potentials are consistent with observational constraints on @xmath297 and @xmath351 , but that double quartic models are completely ruled out , as is the corresponding single - field potential .",
    "the double multiplicative models mostly produce scenarios in which one of the fields dominates the dynamics and hence primarily determines the observables @xmath297 and @xmath351 , so the power to which the dominant field is raised determines whether the scenario is consistent with observations .",
    "the double quadratic and double quartic models produce mostly scenarios in which either the fields co - dominate or one field dominates the dynamics , then followed by the second field dominating .",
    "the latter scenarios possess large turn rates around the transition between phases , so if the transition occurs around the pivot scale , these scenarios tend to be ruled out .",
    "the double quartic models , however , are ruled out regardless of the initial conditions and coupling constants , due to their larger values for @xmath297 and smaller values for @xmath351 .",
    "interestingly , the addition of non - canonical kinetic terms to an otherwise viable double quadratic model creates a far richer landscape of potential background kinematics and power spectra , resulting in a wide range of values for the spectral observables , some of which are consistent with observations and some are not . of note",
    ", certain choices of the field metric produce distributed turning with @xmath473 , making the curvature power spectrum more scale - independent than in the equivalent case with canonical kinetic terms .",
    "this means that the addition of the non - canonical kinetic terms may provide a mechanism for fine - tuning models to match observations .",
    "lastly , in the vast majority of scenarios for all models tested , the isocurvature and cross spectra were at least an order of magnitude or two smaller than the curvature spectrum .      as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", there are compelling theoretical reasons to consider multi - field inflation .",
    "this paper provides a complete theoretical framework and set of tools for parsing and analyzing two - field models of inflation , making it easier to calculate the power spectra and to understand what features a two - field model needs to possess in order to be consistent with observational constraints .    however , there are many outstanding issues that merit further consideration .",
    "particularly important is the issue of initial conditions . how should we weigh the initial conditions ?",
    "since many inflationary models have attractor - like solutions , specifying initial conditions 60 @xmath0-folds before the end of inflation rather than at the beginning of inflation may correspond to a radically different measure on the space of trajectories and hence predicted spectra .",
    "also important are the nature of the end of inflation and reheating .",
    "some models predict further post - inflationary suppression of isocurvature perturbations , while others do not , complicating the use of observational isocurvature bounds for constraining inflationary models .",
    "it is therefore important to make further progress in these areas in order to place tighter constraints on inflationary models .    as for the observational constraints themselves",
    ", we have seen that the combination of scalar and tensor power spectra alone have the potential to constrain or rule out large classes of multi - field inflation models . since the rapid progress in cosmic microwave background measurement precision is likely to continue for some time  with perhaps measurements such as the isocurvature fraction or the correlation angle placing useful constraints on multi - field models in the near future  it is therefore timely to investigate multi - field phenomenology in greater detail .",

    "<S> we derive accurate semi - analytic formulae for the power spectra of two - field inflation assuming an arbitrary potential and arbitrary non - canonical kinetic terms , and we use them both to build phenomenological intuition and to constrain classes of two - field models using wmap data . using covariant formalism , we first develop a framework for understanding the background field kinematics and introduce a `` slow - turn '' approximation . </S>",
    "<S> next , we find covariant expressions for the evolution of the adiabatic / curvature and entropy / isocurvature modes , and we discuss how the evolution of modes can be inferred directly from the background kinematics and the geometry of the field manifold . from these expressions , we derive semi - analytic formulae for the curvature , isocurvature , and cross spectra , and the standard spectral observables , all to second - order in the slow - roll and slow - turn approximations . in tandem , we show how our covariant formalism provides useful intuition into how the general features of the inflationary lagrangian translate into distinct features in the observable power spectra . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find that key features of the power spectra can be directly read off from the nature of the roll path , the curve the field vector rolls along with respect to the two - dimensional field manifold . </S>",
    "<S> for example , models whose roll path makes a sharp turn around 60 @xmath0-foldings before the end of inflation tend to be ruled out because they produce stronger departures from scale invariance than are allowed by the latest cmb observations . finally , we apply our formalism to confront four classes of two - field models with wmap data , including doubly quadratic and quartic potentials and non - standard kinetic terms , showing how whether a model is ruled out or not depends not only on certain features of the inflationary lagrangian , but also on the initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> ultimately , for a two - field model to be consistent with observations , we show that it must possess the right balance of certain kinematical and dynamical behaviors , which we reduce to a set of functions that represent the main characteristics of any two - field model of inflation .    # </S>"
