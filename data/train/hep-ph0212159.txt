    "in hadron - hadron collisions , the transverse momentum of drell - yan pairs or weak gauge bosons ( @xmath1 and @xmath0 ) is generated by emission of gluons and quarks , as predicted by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "therefore , in order to test the qcd theory or electroweak properties of the vector bosons , it is necessary to include the effects of multiple gluon emission .",
    "one theoretical framework designed to account for these effects is the resummation formalism developed by collins , soper , and sterman ( css ) @xcite , which has been applied to study production of single ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and double @xcite electroweak gauge bosons , as well as higgs bosons @xcite , at hadron colliders .",
    "just as the nonperturbative functions , _",
    "i.e. _ , parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) , are needed in order to predict inclusive rates , an additional nonperturbative function , @xmath2 , is required in the css formalism to describe the transverse momentum of , say , weak bosons .",
    "many studies have been performed in the literature to determine @xmath2 using the available low energy drell - yan data @xcite . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite three of us have examined various functional forms of @xmath2 to test the universality of the css formalism in describing the drell - yan and weak boson data .",
    "the result of that study was summarized in table ii of ref . @xcite .",
    "in addition , that paper made several important observations , as to be discussed below .",
    "first , neither the dws form ( cf .",
    "( [ dws_form ] ) ) nor the ly form ( cf .",
    "( [ ly_form ] ) ) of the nonperturbative function @xmath2 could simultaneously describe the drell - yan data in a straightforward global fit of the experiments r209 @xcite , e605 @xcite , and e288 @xcite , as well as the tevatron run 0 @xmath0 boson data from the cdf collaboration @xcite .",
    "hence , it was decided in ref .",
    "@xcite to first fit only the first two mass bins ( @xmath3gev and @xmath4gev ) of the e605 data and all of the r209 and the cdf-@xmath0 boson data in the initial fits @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in total , 31 data points were considered .",
    "we allowed the normalization of the r209 and e605 data to float within their overall systematic normalization errors , while fixing the normalization of the cdf-@xmath0 run 0 data to unity .",
    "second , after the initial fits , we calculated the remaining three high - mass bins of the e605 data not used in fits @xmath7 and found a reasonable agreement with the experimental data . in order to compare with the e288 data , we created fits @xmath8 , in which we fixed the functions @xmath2 to those obtained from fit @xmath6 and performed a fit for norm ( the fitted normalization factor applied to the prediction curves for a given data set ) for the e288 data alone .",
    "we found that the quality of the fit for the e288 data is very similar to that for the e605 data , and that the normalizations were then acceptably within the range quoted by the experiment .",
    "hence , we concluded that the fitted functions @xmath2 reasonably describe the wide - ranging , complete set of data , in the sense discussed above .",
    "third , most importantly , we found that the complete set of data available in that fit was not yet precise enough to clearly separate the @xmath9 and @xmath10 parameters within a pure gaussian form of @xmath2 with @xmath11 dependence similar to that of the ly form .",
    "this gaussian form is given explicitly in eq .",
    "( [ blny_form ] ) .",
    "*   *   *         *   *   *     we will refer to the updated dws and ly parameterizations obtained in the current _ _ global _ _ fit as `` dws - g '' and `` ly - g '' parameterizations , respectively , to distinguish them from the original dws and ly parameterizations @xcite obtained in ( non - global ) fits to a part of the current data .",
    "data used in this analysis . here , @xmath12 is the published normalization uncertainty for each experiment . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ fit_result ]     and @xmath9 between 0 and 1 , and @xmath13 between @xmath14 and 3 . ]",
    "for instance , one might consider a larger value of @xmath15 for the fit . up to now ,",
    "all the fits performed in the literature have taken @xmath15 to be @xmath16 .",
    "however , @xmath15 could be chosen to be as large as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the initial energy scale for the pdf set in use .",
    "several of the most recent pdf sets , such as cteq6 m @xcite , mrst2001 @xcite and mrst2002 @xcite , use @xmath19 as low as 1  gev .",
    "correspondingly , for the new pdf sets @xmath20 can be as large as @xmath21",
    ". it will be interesting to test the @xmath22 prescription with such increased value of @xmath20 in a future study .",
    "moreover , an approach alternative to the @xmath23 prescription was recently proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite . fig",
    ".  7 of ref .",
    "@xcite shows the comparison of this new theory calculation to the run-1 cdf data , which should be compared to fig .",
    "[ fig : cdfz ] of this paper .",
    "furthermore , in refs .",
    "@xcite , another method for performing the extrapolation to the large-@xmath24 region was proposed . to see the difference between the theory predictions for the tevatron @xmath25 data ,",
    "one can compare figs .  5 and 6 of ref .",
    "@xcite to figs .  5 and 4 of this paper .",
    "in a forthcoming publication @xcite , we shall present a detailed comparison of various methods for description of large-@xmath24 physics to the tevatron @xmath25 data .    for comparison",
