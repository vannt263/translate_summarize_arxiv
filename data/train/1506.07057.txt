    "with the discovery of nearly 1000 planets and several thousand additional planet candidates awaiting confirmation , the @xmath0 space mission has set the stage for in - depth studies of different planet populations . in order to study these populations ,",
    "the reliability of the @xmath0 sample must be taken into account .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite find a low global false positive rate for @xmath0 candidates of @xmath110% , suggesting that most of the remaining candidates are real planets .",
    "however , @xcite estimate a 35% false positive rate for @xmath0 candidates due to various types of contamination . @xcite and",
    "@xcite also suggest higher false positive rates of 35% and @xmath150@xmath260% for specific subsets of @xmath0 candidates , such as small candidates in single systems with orbital periods approximately less than six days @xcite . on the other hand , nearly all candidates in multi - candidate systems",
    "are expected to be real @xcite .    given this range of false positive rates , it is unclear how significantly false positives affect statistical studies of different subsets of @xmath0 candidates ( e.g. @xcite ) . in particular , there is an apparent excess of single - candidate systems ( relative to multi - candidate systems ) , but it remains to be seen what fraction of the single - candidate systems are real .",
    "for this reason , candidates believed to be in single systems are the focus of this paper .",
    "such candidates with short - periods are particularly interesting , given that some are located within an apparent sub - jovian desert in the orbital period - planet radius plane @xcite .    in @xcite and @xcite ( hereafter , paper i and paper ii )",
    ", we presented multi - wavelength transit observations of five small , short - period @xmath0 planet candidates ( koi 565.01 and koi 225.01 , 420.01 , 526.01 , and 1187.01 ) acquired with the 10.4-m gran telescopio canarias ( gtc ) .",
    "a complete description of our target selection criteria is given in paper ii and is summarized here , again with only single - candidate systems being considered :    * orbital period @xmath3 days * planet radius @xmath4 @xmath5 * transit depth ( @xmath6 ) @xmath7 500 ppm * transit duration ( @xmath8 ) @xmath9 2.5 h * @xmath0 magnitude ( kp ) @xmath9 15.5    in these previous papers , we looked for wavelength - dependent transit depths for each target , which is suggestive of an eclipsing binary false positive scenario assuming the target is not a system composed of two ( or more ) equal mass or equal temperature eclipsing stars ( which would reveal no color difference ) . of",
    "five targets observed , we identified three as having achromatic light curves and validated two as real planets .",
    "the resulting high false positive rate for our sample was not surprising , given the large percentage of eclipsing binaries with short orbital periods that can mimic planetary transits ( particularly when diluted by other nearby or unresolved stars ) .",
    "in this paper , we present multi - wavelength transit observations from the gtc of three additional small , short - period @xmath0 planet candidates ( koi 439.01 , 531.01 , and 732.01 ) . tables [ props ] and [ cprops ] list some relevant properties for each of these targets . in sections [ sobs ] and [ sdata ] , we present a summary of our observations and our data reduction and analysis .",
    "results for each target are presented in section [ sresults ] .",
    "a discussion of our results for each target , as well as an updated investigation of trends in the false positive rate with different planetary and stellar parameters , is given in section [ sdiscuss ] .",
    "we also include a discussion of candidates located within the apparent sub - jovian desert in section [ sdiscuss ] , and we offer concluding remarks in section [ sconc ] .",

    "@xcite identified a companion 5.34 mag fainter in @xmath10-band and 5.453 arcsec from the target .",
    "as our aperture was 3.0 - 3.3 arcsec , we avoided contamination from this companion . @xcite also ruled out companions within 2.5 arcsec of the target . from this , we believe that the transit signal is indeed coming from the target .    it should be noted that koi 439.01 was included in the third version of the @xmath0 eclipsing binary catalog . eclipsing binary stars , and it is not a comprehensive catalog of @xmath11 @xmath0 eclipsing binaries ; http://keplerebs.villanova.edu/ ] furthermore , a second planet candidate was found in this system with a period of 5.4 days and a depth of 117 ppm ( koi 439.02 ) , but was later flagged as a false alarm @xcite . while unrelated , these facts do raise a cautionary flag towards the planetary nature of koi 439.01 .",
    "regardless , our observations show no .",
    "this target was noted by @xcite as a particularly interesting planet , if confirmed .",
    "this is because based on the estimated planet radius ( 3.9 @xmath5 ) and the short orbital period ( 1.9 days ) , this candidate sits within what is becoming known as the sub - jovian desert .",
    "we discuss this region in further detail in  [ pampas ] .",
    "suggests that koi 531.01 is indeed a false positive .",
    "our fpp calculations specifically suggest that koi 531.01 is itself an eb ( rather than being a hierarchical system or a blend with a background eclipsing system ) .",
    "this is supported by @xcite , who detected no companions down to @xmath12@xmath13 = 5 within 2.5 arcsec .",
    "given that @xcite was sensitive only to targets up to @xmath15 mag fainter at distances of 0.5 arcsec from the target , it is still possible that there is a faint stellar companion blended with the host star that either affected our photometry and/or is the source of the observed transit signal .",
    "we urge radial velocity and additional photometric follow - up to help clarify the nature of this system .",
    "if real , it would be one of the few known giant ( @xmath16 @xmath5 ) planets with an m dwarf host .",
    "after our observations were conducted , the @xmath0 team identified two additional candidate planets around koi 732 .",
    "given the extremely low false positive probability for candidates in multi - planet systems @xcite ,    we note that the phase - folded @xmath0 light curve given in the data validation summary from the nasa exoplanet archive for this target displays ` brightening ' features before ingress and after egress .",
    "we find no evidence of this in our light curve , and we attribute this to be an artifact of the reduction process in the @xmath0 pipeline .    this is another target that was noted by @xcite as being within the sub - jovian desert , which we discuss further in ",
    "[ pampas ] .      in papers i and",
    "ii , we identified a total of three false positives ( koi 565.01 , 225.01 , and 1187.01 ) and supported two candidates as validated planets ( koi 420.01 and 526.01 ) .",
    "thus , of eight candidates observed in total , we identify four as viable planets and identify four as false positives .",
    "this suggests a false positive rate as high as 50% for short - period candidates . in figure",
    "[ perhist ] , we present the latest distribution of @xmath0 planet candidates , eclipsing binaries , and false positives . eclipsing binary catalog ( http://keplerebs.villanova.edu/ ) on 2014 june 25 . ]",
    "the false positives are those kois that are listed with a @xmath0 disposition of false positive .",
    "we note that the cumulative catalog was used to generate these distributions , which has not been fully vetted to date .",
    "therefore , some false positives could exist among the kois listed as candidates .",
    "these distributions clearly emphasize the continued prevalence of eclipsing binaries ( and correspondingly , false positives ) at the shortest orbital periods , as discussed in further detail in paper ii .",
    "given the small sample size presented here , we can not make strong statements regarding trends in the false positive rate with other planetary or stellar parameters .",
    "still , after investigating different parameters that included the @xmath0 magnitude and galactic latitude , we find no evidence of correlations in the properties of our identified false positives or their hosts .",
    "however , we find that at short periods ( @xmath14 days ) , the distribution of kois dispositioned as false positives is clearly skewed towards lower galactic latitudes compared to the candidate population ( figure [ lathist ] ) .",
    "this is to be expected , given the increased density of stars closer to the galactic plane .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , the distributions of @xmath0-identified false positives and candidates in terms of their @xmath0 magnitude are similar , except at the faintest magnitudes ( kp @xmath15 16 ) where false positives are more prevalent ( also as expected ) .",
    "lastly , we do not expect our findings to be otherwise biased by our selection criteria , though we note that our restriction on transit depth and/or duration could technically bias the spectral types we target .",
    "we do not expect such a bias in our current target sample , given that the stellar effective temperatures of our targets range from about 4000 to 6000 k.     planet candidates ( green ) , false positives ( red ) , and eclipsing binaries ( blue ) as a function of orbital period .",
    "the arrows indicate the periods of the eight kois in our entire sample .",
    "the green arrows indicate kois we tentatively identify as planets , and the red arrows indicate those kois identified as false positives .",
    "the two red arrows filled with green are kois that are still listed in the @xmath0 catalog as active planet candidates ( ) . ]    , but for the distribution of @xmath0 planet candidates ( green ) and false positives ( red ) as a function of galactic latitude . only planet candidates and false positives with periods less than 6.5 days are included .",
    "the arrows are the same as in figure [ perhist ] . ]      with the increasing numbers of confirmed exoplanets and the thousands of planet candidates from @xmath0 , exciting trends have been emerging in the planet population .",
    "in particular , there is a region in the period - radius plane ( and correspondingly in the period - mass plane ) where there appears to be no known planets .",
    "this region has been referred to as the sub - jovian desert and is the subject of several recent studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the region encompasses orbital periods approximately less than 2.5 days and radii between about 3 and 11 @xmath5 ( figure [ perrad ] ) . for comparison purposes ,",
    "we show in figure [ permass ] the desert in the period - mass plane ( where it spans approximately 0.03@xmath21 @xmath16 ) .",
    "the lack of planets in this region can not be easily explained by observational bias .",
    "short - period planets are generally easier to detect , especially if they are larger or more massive than earth . assuming the desert is not due to observational bias",
    ", this suggests that there is some formation mechanism at play .",
    "for instance , if orbital migration is required for planets to end up on close - in orbits , then there might be a limiting mass where planets can no longer migrate inward .",
    "the pile - up of hot jupiters around @xmath13 days is suggestive of this .",
    "however , since smaller / less massive planets are ( apparently ) allowed to orbit very close to their host stars ( e.g. with periods less than 1 day ) , it has been theorized that these small planets are the leftover cores of planets that had their atmospheres blown away by the host star ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this mechanism is likely most effective for planets with low surface gravity , and not necessarily for all hot jupiters .",
    "@xcite investigated evaporation in detail and conclude that evaporation explains a lack of low density planets on close - in orbits as well as a deficit of planets around 2 @xmath5 .",
    "currently , this seems to be the most viable explanation to explain the observed distribution of planets and candidates .",
    "while beyond the scope of this paper , @xcite offer a more complete discussion of alternative causes of the desert , including that hot jupiters may have been tidally captured while super - earth - size planets may have been affected by disk - planet interactions . given the competing formation mechanisms , any candidate planets within this desert are therefore of extreme interest .",
    "however , several kois have properties that place them near the boundaries of the region , and uncertainties in the planetary radius can easily shift some of them out of the desert .",
    "follow - up observations of these kois are needed to confirm their planetary nature .",
    "at least three of the kois in the desert are in known multiple candidate systems , suggesting that these are likely real planets . , and three other confirmed planets ( kepler-41b , kepler-119b , wasp-43b ) , there could be at least eight known planets located in the desert so far ( albeit towards the edges of the region )",
    ". it will be interesting to see if the kois that are in the more central region of the desert survive the vetting process , considering the .",
    "it may be that planets can exist in this regime , but under atypical circumstances of planetary formation and migration .",
    "if none do , it at least appears that some planets are filling out the edges of the region and as a result , the boundaries of the desert are being constrained .",
    "the continued study of planets in this region is therefore critical for informing planetary formation theories and at the very least will help to constrain the boundaries of the desert .",
    "planet candidates ( green circles ) .",
    "the black squares mark the locations of the four kois we as planets , while the red circles mark the four kois that we identified as false positives .",
    "the parameters for confirmed planets were taken from the exoplanet orbit database at exoplanets.org on 2014 july 31 .",
    "the region marked by dashed black lines indicates the regime of the so - called sub - jovian desert ( for @xmath17 @xmath1 3@xmath211 @xmath5 and @xmath18 @xmath19 2.5 days ) . ]",
    "1 @xmath16 and @xmath18 @xmath19 2.5 days . ]",
    "in combination with results from previously published work @xcite , we have vetted a total of eight small , short - period @xmath0 candidates through gtc observations . while our sample size is small , our results support a slightly higher false positive rate for short - period planet candidates than for the overall sample .",
    "this is in agreement with results from other studies and    has interesting implications for @xmath0 planet candidates located within the sub - jovian desert , a region in the period - radius plane where some planetary formation mechanisms appear to restrict planets from living there .",
    "future observations of these candidates will improve our understanding of different formation scenarios , particularly if none of these candidates survive the vetting process .",
