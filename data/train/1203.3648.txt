    "the electron neutrino mass can be determined in the single beta decay ( mainz , troisk and in the future katrin / karlsruhe ) and for majorana neutrinos also in the neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "although with both methods one has not yet succeeded to determine the effective electron neutrino mass , the neutrinoless double beta decay has in the future the potential to to measure the effective majorana neutrino mass even to smaller values than in the single beta decay .",
    "for this the neutrino needs to be a majorana particle ( identicall with the antiparticle ) , the transition matrix element must be able to be calculated reliably and the light majorana neutrino exchange must be the leading mechanisme for the neutrinoless double beta decay .    the purpose of this contribution is first to investigate the accuracy , with which one can calculate the transition matrix elements .",
    "second we want to find an experimental proceedure , which allows to determine the leading mechanisme for the neutrinoless decay : is it the light majorana neutrino exchange as usually assumed or the exchange of a left or right handed heavy neutrino allowed in left - right symmetric grand unified theories ( gut s ) .",
    "an additional possible mechanisme is due to suppersymmetry ( susy ) by a trilinear term in the lagrangian , which violates lepton number and r - parity conservation .",
    "the transition matrix elements for the light majorana neutrino exchange are presently calculated with four different methosd .",
    "they are reviewd in chapter , where they are compared with each other with their advantages and their drawbacks @xcite .",
    "the different methods are the quasi - particle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) for spherical ( chapter 2 ) and deformed nuclei @xcite , the shell model ( sm ) @xcite , the projected hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( phfb ) approach @xcite ( in reference @xcite a missing factor two in all older works of the group has been pointed out . ) and the interacting boson model ( ibm2 )  @xcite . in the third chapter we do not assume , that the light left handed majorana neutrino exchange is the leading mechanism @xcite .",
    "we search for a possible experimental identification of the leading mechanism even in cases , where two or even three equally strong mechanisms interfere .",
    "the diagram for the neutrinoless double beta decay with the exchange of the light majorana neutrino is shown in figure [ neutrinoless1 ] for the decay of @xmath1 to @xmath2 through the intermediate nucleus @xmath3 .",
    "to @xmath2 through the intermediate nucleus @xmath3 is shown .",
    "the neutrino must be identicaql with the antineutrino ( majorana neutrino ) and helicity must not be a good quantum number .",
    "this means the neutrino must be a massive majorana particle . ]",
    "in addition to the light left handed majorana neutrino exchange , one has other possible mechanisms as cause for the neutrinoless double beta decay : grand unification ( gut ) , supersymmerty ( susy ) and extensions to extra dimensions .",
    "we shall discuss here extension to gut s and susy . in a left - right symmetric model of gut",
    "we have :    @xmath4    @xmath5 is the usual vector boson of rubbia and coworkers of 80.4 gev mainly responsible for the left handed weak interaction .",
    "the mixture in eq .",
    "[ gut ] allows at each vertex in figure [ neutrinoless1 ] left and right handed interactions . in addition one has susy contributions , where mainly the threelinear terms are responsible for the lepton number violation @xcite .",
    "this will be discussed in chapter three of this contribution .",

    "( [ element ] ) with the matrix element @xmath8 and the effective majorana mass    @xmath9    with    @xmath10    is the light majorana neutrino exchange contribution .",
    "the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) is used by the groups in tbingen , bratislava and jyvskyl  @xcite , while the strasbourg - madrid group  @xcite uses the shell model ( sm ) , tomoda , faessler , schmid and gruemmer  @xcite and rath and coworkers  @xcite use the angular momentum projected hartree - fock - bogoliubov method ( hfb ) , and barea and iachello  @xcite use the interacting boson model ( ibm2 , which distinguishes between protons and neutrons ) .    the qrpa  @xcite has the advantage to allow to use a large single - particle basis .",
    "thus , one is able to include to each single nucleon state in the qrpa model space also the spin - orbit partner , which guarantees that the ikeda sum rule  @xcite is fulfilled .",
    "this is essential to describe correctly the gamow - teller strength .",
    "the sm  @xcite is presently still restricted to a nuclear basis of four to five single - particle levels for the description of the neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "therefore , not all spin - orbit partners can be included and , as a result , the ikeda sum rule is violated by 34 to 50% depending on the single particle basis used .    in qrpa one",

    "@xcite : @xmath25       the sm approach has been applied by the strasbourg - madrid group  @xcite to neutrinoless double beta decay  @xcite using the closure relation with an averaged energy denominator . in this way",
    "one does not need to calculate the states in the odd - odd intermediate nuclei .",
    "the quality of the results depends then on the description of the @xmath17 ground states in the initial and final nuclei of the double beta decay system , e.g. @xmath26ge @xmath27se , on the nucleon - nucleon interaction matrix elements fitted by the oslo group in neighbouring muclei and on the average energy denominator chosen ( fitted ) for closure .",
    "the @xmath11 transition matrix element ( [ mnu ] ) simplifies as shown in equations ( 5 ) to ( 11 ) of ref .  @xcite .",
    "since the number of many body configurations is increasing drastically with the single - particle basis , one is forced to restrict for mass numbers @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the sm the single - particle basis to @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath32se nucleus is calculated in the sm for five basis single - particle levels including also @xmath33 . for the mass region around @xmath34",
    "the sm basis is restricted to @xmath35 and @xmath36 levels .",
    "the problem with these small basis sets is that the spin - orbit partners @xmath33 and @xmath37 have to be omitted  @xcite .",
    "the sm results then automatically violate the ikeda sum rule ( isr )  @xcite , while the qrpa satisfies it exactly .",
    "the ikeda sum rule is : @xmath38 @xmath39 [ \\sum_{l}^{a } \\sigma_{\\mu}(l ) t_{-}(l ) ] |0^{+}_i \\rangle , \\label{s}\\ ] ] for @xmath40 the subscripts at the isospin rising and lowering operators are exchanged .",
    "figure  [ qrpa - sm1 ] shows the qrpa contributions of different angular momenta of the neutron pairs , which are changed in proton pairs with the same angular momenta . in figure  [ qrpa - sm1 ]",
    "the left bar is the result for @xmath32se obtained with the single - particle basis @xmath30 and @xmath31 used in the sm .",

    "the second bar from the left represents the result with addition of the @xmath41 level .",
    "the isr is exhausted by 66% .",

    "the isr is 100% fulfilled . for the right bar the basis is increased to 9 single - particle levels for neutrons and protons ( @xmath42 ) .    in the last ten years",

    "@xcite ) on @xmath43 decay and , since 2008 , also on @xmath11 decay , in which they used a simple pairing plus quadrupole many body hamiltonian of the kumar and baranger type  @xcite to calculate the neutrinoless double beta decay transition matrix elements with angular momentum projection from a hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) wave function after variation .",
    "schmid  @xcite did show , that with the assumption of a real bogoliubov transformation ( real coefficient a and b ) , axial symmetry    @xmath44    and no parity mixing , only @xmath45 nucleon pairs and excited states are allowed ( see eqn .",

    "figure [ hfb - fig ] shows on the other side , that the projected hfb approach is restricted to contributions of neutron pairs with angular momenta @xmath46 .",
    "in addition , one sees that the contributions of transition of higher angular momentum neutron to proton pairs @xmath47 are drastically reduced compared to the qrpa and the sm see fig .",
    "[ hfb - fig ] .",
    "the reason for this is obvious : in a spherical nucleus the hfb solution contains only seniority zero and no stronger higher angular momentum pairs .",
    "the double beta decay system @xmath48 has only small deformations and thus a projected hfb state is not able to describe an appreciable admixture of higher angular momentum pairs for @xmath49 transitions as can be seen in ref .",

    "to have also @xmath51 one has to allow parity mixing in the bogoliubov transformation ( [ bogo ] ) . but even allowing all different types of angular momentum and parity pairs one would still have an unnatural suppression of the higher angular momenta especially for smaller deformations .",
    "this handicap could probably be overcome by a multi - configuration hfb wave function @xcite with complex coefficients and parity mixing in the bogoliubov ( [ bogo ] ) transformation .",
    "the ibm ( interacting boson model )  @xcite can only change @xmath52 ( s ) and @xmath53 ( d ) fermionic pairs from two neutrons into two protons .",
    "in the bosonization to higher orders this leads to the creation and annihilation of up to three `` s '' and `` d '' boson annihilation and creation operators in ref .",
    "but all these terms of equation ( 18 ) of reference  @xcite originate from the annihilation of a @xmath52 ( s ) or a @xmath53 ( d ) neutron pair into a corresponding proton pair with the same angular momentum .",
