    "<S> ( [ wehfn]).,title=\"fig:\",width=211 ]    in conclusion , we derived short - pulse equations ( spes ) describing the propagation of ultra - short pulses in nonlinear ( kerr - type ) metamaterials . </S>",
    "<S> two spes were found for the high- and low - frequency band gaps , respectively , characterized by a negative ( positive ) linear effective permittivity ( permeability ) , where propagation of linear electromagnetic ( em ) waves is not allowed . </S>",
    "<S> we also discussed the structure of the solutions of the spes and presented the approximate peakon - like and breather - like solitary waves , which can be regarded as weak ultra - short gap solitons . </S>",
    "<S> we also examined these structures via numerical computations to illustrate the apparent non - robustness of the former , and stable propagation of the latter . </S>",
    "<S> generally , the existence of such structures , indicates the possibility of nonlinear localization of em waves in the gaps of nonlinear metamaterials . </S>",
    "<S> interesting subjects for future research would include systematic studies of the stability of such ultra - short gap solitons both in the framework of the spes and maxwell s equations as well as higher dimensional generalizations of the structures considered herein . </S>"
