    "classical monte carlo simulations@xcite of the path integral in euclidean lattice gauge theory@xcite have been very successful , and this is currently the preferred method for _ ab initio _ calculations in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in the low energy regime .",
    "monte carlo approaches to the hamiltonian version of qcd propounded by kogut and susskind@xcite have been less successful , however , and lag at least ten years behind the euclidean calculations .",
    "our aim in this paper is to see whether useful results can be obtained for the hamiltonian version by using the standard euclidean monte carlo methods for anisotropic lattices@xcite , and extrapolating to the hamiltonian limit in which the time variable becomes continuous , i.e. the lattice spacing in the time direction goes to zero .",
    "the hamiltonian version of lattice gauge theory is less popular than the euclidean version , but is still worthy of study .",
    "it can provide a valuable check of the universality of the euclidean results@xcite , and it allows the application of many techniques imported from quantum many - body theory and condensed matter physics , such as strong coupling expansions@xcite , the t - expansion@xcite , the coupled - cluster method@xcite and more recently the density matrix renormalization group@xcite ( dmrg ) .",
    "none of these techniques has proved as useful as monte carlo in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions ; but in lower dimensions they are more competitive .",
    "a number of quantum monte carlo methods have been applied to hamiltonian lattice gauge theory in the past , with somewhat mixed results .",
    "a  projector monte carlo \" approach@xcite using a strong coupling representation for the gauge fields and a greens function monte carlo ( gfmc ) approach @xcite , which makes use of a weak coupling representation of the gauge fields .",
    "however both the approaches run into difficulties in that the former approach runs into difficulties for non - abelian models , and the later requires the use of a  trial wave function \" to guide random walkers in the ensemble towards the preferred regions of configuration space@xcite .",
    "this introduces a variational element into the procedure , in that the results may exhibit a systematic dependence on the trial wave function @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we are forced to look yet again for an alternative approach .    as mentioned above our aim in this paper",
    "is to use standard euclidean path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) techniques for anisotropic lattices , and see whether useful results can be obtained in the hamiltonian limit .",
    "morningstar and peardon@xcite showed some time ago that the use of anisotropic lattices can be advantageous in any case , particularly for the measurement of glueball masses .",
    "we use a number of their techniques in what follows .    as a first trial of this approach",
    ", we treat the u(1 ) gauge model in ( 2 + 1)d , which is one of the simplest models with dynamical gauge degrees of freedom , and has also been studied extensively by other means ( see section ii ) .",
    "path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) methods were applied to this model a long time ago by hey and collaborators@xcite , but the techniques used at that time were not very sophisticated , and the results were rather qualitative .",
    "very little has been done since then using this approach on this particular model .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the u(1 ) model in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions in its lattice formulation , and outline some of the work done on it previously .",
    "the details of the simulations , including the generation of the gauge - field configurations , the construction of the wilson loop operators , and the extraction of the potential and string tension estimates are described in section iii . in section",
    "iv we present our main results for the mean plaquette , static quark potential , string tension .",
    "the static quark potential has not previously been exhibited for this model , as far as we are aware .",
    "finally we make an extrapolation to the hamiltonian limit , and comparisons are made with estimates obtained by other means in that limit .",

    "the parameter @xmath3 is related to the bare gauge coupling by @xmath11 where @xmath12 , in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "the lattice u(1 ) model in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions has been studied by many authors , and possesses some important similarities with qcd ( for a more extensive review , see for example ref .",
    "if one takes the  naive \" continuum limit at a fixed energy scale , one regains the simple continuum theory of non - interacting photons@xcite ; but if one renormalizes or rescales in the standard way so as to maintain the mass gap constant , then one obtains a confining theory of free massive bosons .",
    "polyakov@xcite showed that a linear potential appears between static charges due to instantons in the lattice theory ; and g \" opfert and mack@xcite proved that in the continuum limit the theory converses to a scalar free field theory of massive bosons .",
    "they found that in that limit the mass gap behaves as @xmath13 while the string tension is bounded by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the coulomb potential at zero distance , and has a value in lattice units @xmath16 for the isotropic case .",

    "we propose a change @xmath40 to this link angle , which is randomly drawn from a uniform distribution on @xmath41 $ ] , where @xmath42 is adjusted for each set of parameters to give an acceptable  hit rate \" around 70 - 80% . the change is accepted or rejected according to the standard metropolis procedure .    for high anisotropy ( @xmath43 ) ,",
    "any change in a time - like plaquette will produce a large change in the action , whereas changes to the space - like plaquettes will cause a much smaller change in the action .",
    "this makes the system very  stiff \" against variations in the time - like plaquettes , and therefore very slow to equilibrate , with long autocorrelation times .",
    "to alleviate this problem , we used a fourier update procedure@xcite . here",

    "the system was much slower to equilibrate , despite the fourier acceleration , and in the worst case the equilibration time was of order 100,000 thousand sweeps .",
    "after discarding the initial sweeps , the configurations were stored every 250 sweeps thereafter for later analysis . ensembles of about 1,000 configurations were stored to measure the static quark potential and glueball masses at each @xmath3 for @xmath57 , and 1,400 configurations for @xmath58 .",
    "measurements made on these stored configurations were grouped into 5 blocks , and then the mean and standard deviation of the final quantities were estimated by averaging over the  block averages \" , treated as independent measurements .",
