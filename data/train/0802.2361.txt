    "even in dwarf galaxies belonging to another cluster of galaxies , many gcs have been observed ( miller et al.1998 ) .",
    "but , why these gcs can survive from strong dynamical friction is a long - standing puzzle .",
    "read et al.2006(hereafter , r06 ) , by n - body simulations , discovered that dynamical friction is weekened significantly if dwarf galaxies have a constant density core in its dark matter halo .",
    "they argue that the halo particles in constant density core become co - rotating with a gc , and thus the halo particles construct new equilibrium state including the gc .",
    "this equilibrium cease dynamical friction , thus the gc can survive beyond the age of the universe .",
    "but , the new equilibrium is very vulnerable to perturbation .",
    "if once the gc orbit is perturbed and the orbital plane is inclined , this equilibrium will be broken . and dynamical friction force on the gc is rejuvenated by perturbation in the orbital inclination . this fragile nature of the new equiliburium is also indicated in r06 . in the paper of r06 , they studied only single gc cases .",
    "but , of course , real dwarf galaxies do nt necessarily have only one gc , but severals or more .",
    "we expect that the orbits of gcs will be perturbed by gravity of other gcs .",
    "then we anticipate that some gcs will fall into the galactic center and form a stellar nucleus .",
    "first , we carried out the same simulation as r06 in a constant density cored halo(fig.[fig:1 ] ) .",
    "we got the same result as r06 .",
    "when the gc entererd the central core region(from 200 - 300pc ) , the orbital shrinkage stopped .",
    "next , we examined 5gcs case and 30gcs case.(fig.[fig:2 ] and fig.[fig:3 ] ) . in comparison with the sigle gc case , clearly gcs",
    "are perturbed by gravitational interaction .",
    "regardless of the nunmber of gcs , no gc fall into the center of galaxy .",
    "all gcs continue orbital motions in the constant density core region .",
    "this result is not consistent with our expectation or the statement of r06 .                in this study",
    ", we confirmed that constant a density core ceases dynamical friction on gcs .",
    "this is consistent with the result of r06 .",
    "but , even under the perturbation from other gcs , dynamical friction does not affect .",
    "this result is inconsistent with the insight of r06 .",
    "we consider that this inconsistency is due to the misunderstanding about the mechanism for suppression of dynamical friction in r06(co - rotating equilibrium ) .",
    "a constant density core must have another reason of ceasing dynamical friction .",
    "we make a full report on this study in inoue & noguchi 2008(in preparation ) ."
