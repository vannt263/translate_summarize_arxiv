    "protoplanetary disks accrete their gas content and evolve into debris disks ( produced by the collision of larger sized bodies ) on a timescale of 10 million years .",
    "the signatures of debris disks appear as mid - ir excess emission . the fraction of stars displaying mid - ir excess and the magnitude of the excess appears to decrease with time . on top of this overall trend ,",
    "a few individual stars show extremely large excesses even at several hundred million years . determining the nature and frequency of the events producing those excesses",
    "promises to provide an important perspective on planetary system evolution .",
    "the 30 - 150 myr range is especially interesting since @xcite and @xcite showed that the earth - moon system was formed by a collision about 30 - 150 myr after the solar system was formed .",
    "@xcite called attention to a @xmath035 myr old system with a large amount of debris that might have resulted from such a giant collision . @xcite and",

    "ngc 2451a and b are two young open clusters projected on each other along the same line of sight that are within this interesting age range .",
    "several attempts have been made to separate the two clusters and to determine the physical parameters of each one of them .",
    "@xcite analysed photometric and spectroscopic data and used proper motions and radial velocities to select members of ngc2451a .",
    "they fit theoretical isochrones to the cluster color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) to calculate its distance , reddening , and age .",
    "they derived d=188 pc , e(b - v)=0.01 and age=60 myr .",
    "@xcite carried out an x - ray study of the two clusters and identified 39 members of the a and 49 of the b cluster using combined x - ray and optical data .",
    "they derived distances of 206 pc and 370 pc , with corresponding ages of 50 - 80 myr and 50 myr for ngc2451a and b , respectively .",
    "@xcite completed the x - ray study with high - resolution spectroscopy and refined the membership of the two clusters .",
    "the most recent distance and age estimate was performed by @xcite .",
    "they estimated distances of 188 pc and 430 pc and ages of 57.5 myr and 75.9 myr for ngc2451 a and b , respectively .",
    "however , their analysis was based on only a handful of member candidates ( 26 and 11 for ngc  2451a and b , respectively ) in contrast with @xcite .",
    "therefore we adopt the @xcite distances and ages and reddening ( e(b - v ) of 0.01 and 0.05 for ngc2451 a and b , respectively ) for our analysis .    in this paper",

    "we supplement our _ spitzer _ observations with a large - scale spectroscopic and optical photometric program to refine and extend our knowledge of the membership of these clusters .",
    "observations of ngc2451 were obtained on 2004 march 02 with irac @xcite .",
    "the irac survey covers about 0.6 square degree centered on hd 63032 , a k2.5ib star .",
    "the 12s high - dynamic - range mode was used to obtain two frames in each position , one with 0.4s exposure time and one with 10.4s .",
    "the observation of each field was repeated twice with a small offset , providing 20.8s integration time for each position .",
    "the frames were processed using the spitzer science center ( ssc ) irac pipeline v14.0 , and mosaics were created from the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) frames using a custom idl program ( see @xcite for details ) . due to the 7 arcmin offset between",
    "channel 1/3 and channel 2/4 the total area covered in all four channels is about 0.45 sq degree .",
    "source finding and aperture photometry on these images were carried out using photvis version 1.10 , which is an idl - gui based photometry visualization tool ( see @xcite for further details on photvis ) .",
    "the radii of the source aperture , and of the inner and outer boundaries of the sky annulus were 2.4 , 2.4 and 7.2 arc - second , respectively .",
    "the calibration used large aperture measurements of standard stars .",
    "the zero point magnitudes of the calibration were 19.6642 , 18.9276 , 16.8468 , and 17.3909 corresponding to zero point fluxes of 280.9 , 179.7 , 115.0,64.13 jy for channels 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively .",
    "aperture corrections of 0.21 , 0.23 , 0.35 and 0.5 mag were applied for channels 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 to account for the differences between the aperture sizes used for the standard stars and for the ngc  2451 photometry .",
    "we accepted as good detections those with photometric uncertainties less than 0.2 mag , which allowed limiting magnitudes of 18.2 , 17.5 , 15.4 and 14.8 at 3.6 @xmath1 m , 4.5 @xmath1 m , 5.8 @xmath1 m , 8.0 @xmath1 m , respectively .",
    "we detected almost 30000 sources at 3.6 @xmath1 m , more than 20000 at 4.5 @xmath1 m , and over 4000 and 3000 in the 5.8 @xmath1 m and 8.0 @xmath1 m images .",

    "the observations were carried out in scan map mode .",
    "the frames were processed using the mips data analysis tool @xcite .",
    "we used photvis to extract the sources in the 24 @xmath1 m image and psf fitting in the iraf / daophot package was used to obtain photometry .",
    "we used a 0.59 mag aperture correction and a 7.17 jy zero point to convert our psf photometry to the 24 @xmath1 m magnitude scale . similarly to the irac photometry we also discarded sources with errors larger than 0.2 mag , leaving 2625 sources in our mips sample .",
    "the limiting magnitude of our 24 @xmath1 m survey is 11.8 , which corresponds to masses of 0.55 m@xmath3 ( early m spectral type ) and 0.9 m@xmath3 ( early k spectral type ) for stars with pure photospheric emission at the distance of ngc2451 a and b , respectively .",

    "the observations were made through johnson - cousins @xmath7 filters , from the tek # 1 filter set .",

    "one off - cluster area ( separated by @xmath11 deg from the cluster center ) was also imaged to sample the galactic foreground / background object population in the same line - of - sight .",
    "each field was imaged three times through the same filter .",
    "one frame was obtained with a short exposure time ( @xmath12 s for @xmath13 and @xmath14 s for @xmath15 ) and the other two frames were taken with a longer one ( @xmath16 s for @xmath13 , @xmath17 s for @xmath18 and @xmath19 s for @xmath20 ) .",
    "the reductions of the raw frames were performed with standard routines using _",
    "iraf_. after trimming the edges of the frames and subtracting the bias level from each image , the frames were divided by a master flat field image obtained by median combining the available flat field frames for each filter .",
    "both dome flats and sky flats were taken at the beginning of each night and combined together into the master flat frames .",
    "after flat field division , the two long - exposure frames corresponding to the same filter were averaged to increase the signal - to - noise .",
    "the photometry of the cluster frames was computed via psf - fitting using daophot implemented in _",
    "iraf_. a 2nd order spatially variable psf ( varorder=2 ) was built for each frame to compensate for distortions of the psfs due to either the optical imaging artifacts in the large field - of - view , or guiding errors that occured randomly on a few frames .",
    "for the psf - model , function = auto was selected , i.e. each built - in psf - function was computed and the best - fitting one was adopted automatically . in most cases",
    "the penny1 or the penny2 function was the best - fitting one .",
    "the psf - stars were selected interactively from a sample of the @xmath21 brightest , non - saturated stars on each frame , omitting the ones with suspicious profiles and/or detectable neighbors within @xmath22 pixels .",
    "the fitrad parameter was set as @xmath14 pixels corresponding roughly to the fwhm of the frames with the lowest quality .",
    "the detection threshold was fixed at the @xmath23 level on each frame .    inspecting the results of the psf photometry revealed that there is a small , but significant , difference between the results of the psf and aperture photometry of the same stellar field .",
    "this difference was about the same ( within @xmath24 mag ) for the bright stars in one field , but its amount varied from field to field , ranging from a few hundredths up to @xmath25 mag .",
    "the aperture photometry was computed with @xmath26 pixels aperture radius ( about 3.4@xmath27 ) .",
    "the local sky level was estimated as the mode of the pixel distribution within an annulus having inner and outer radii of @xmath12 and @xmath28 pixels , respectively , centered on each object . because @xmath29 was more than twice the stellar fwhm for most frames , much of this difference was probably due to the distorted stellar psfs mentioned above , plus the problems in determining the local sky level during the psf - fitting .",
    "therefore , we fixed the zero point of the photometry by selecting a bright , unsaturated , uncrowded reference star on each frame , and using its magnitude from aperture photometry as a reference level .",
    "thus , the final instrumental magnitudes were determined as follows : first , differential magnitudes were computed between the psf - magnitudes of all stars and the reference object , then the magnitude of the reference object from aperture photometry was added to each differential magnitude .",
    "for the short - exposure frames , the same procedure was applied , but for the reference object the magnitudes from the long - exposure frames were selected , thus ensuring a common zero point for the photometry of the long- and short - exposure frames .",
    "the transformation of the ctio instrumental magnitudes into the standard johnson - cousins system was performed via observations of landolt photometric standard sequences @xcite .",
    "the l98 , l101 and ru152 standard fields were imaged through each filter , weather and time permitting , on each night at different airmasses ( up to 4 different elevations in the case of the l98 field ) . since photometric accuracy is essential for the conclusions of this paper , we give the details of our calibration and standard transformation below .",
    "the following formulae were adopted for converting the instrumental magnitudes into standard ones : @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the instrumental @xmath34-magnitude and color index ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 or @xmath38 ) , @xmath34 and @xmath39 are the standard magnitudes and colors , @xmath40 the airmass , the @xmath41s are the extinction coefficients , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the color - dependent transformation slopes ( the color terms ) , and the @xmath44s are the zero points .",

    "the instrumental magnitudes of these stars were computed from aperture photometry using the same aperture and annulus radii as mentioned above for the cluster frames .",
    "the transformation coefficients were then derived by fitting eq.1 and 2 to the instrumental and standard magnitudes via @xmath52-minimization .",
    "table  [ tbl - stdtrafo ] lists the parameters for each filter combination ( note that both @xmath53 and @xmath54 were applied as the color index in eq.1 ) .    with the parameters listed in table [ tbl - stdtrafo ] determined , the color terms and extinction coefficients were kept fixed and only the zero points were fitted to the data for standard stars observed on the next two nights . because we experienced slightly variable transparency during the second night , we have not attempted to adjust the extinction correction coefficients to achieve the best fit .",
    "the variation of the zero points ( collected together in table [ tbl - zpt ] ) is under @xmath55 mag except for @xmath56 , illustrating the stability of the photometric conditions at the ctio site during our observing run .",

    "this resulted in a final sample of @xmath65 stars having calibrated photometry in at least the    @xmath34 and @xmath66 filters with uncertainties less than @xmath67 magnitude .",
    "the quality and the stability of the whole photometry including the standard transformation has been verified by comparing our standard v and b - v magnitudes with those from @xcite for the @xmath68 stars in common between the two samples .",

    "the mean difference between the two samples is @xmath69 mag in @xmath34 and @xmath70 mag in @xmath71 ( the errors are the rms of the residuals ) , thus , statistically insignificant .",
    "therefore our new ccd photometry in the field of ngc  2451 results in a sample containing @xmath65 stars with calibrated data .",
    "this nearly doubles the amount of photometric data available for this field .",
    "we acquired aaomega data using the anglo - australian telescope at siding spring , australia on three nights , february 15 , 16 and 17 , 2008 , in acceptable conditions ( clear skies with 1.5 - 2.5 arcsec seeing ) .",

    "we show the spectroscopic candidates in fig .",
    "[ fig : specsampl ] together with all the stars with available v and k photometry in the field .",
    "our spectroscopic coverage is not complete for two reasons : ( i ) we concentrated our efforts to the central part of the cluster where we had @xmath74 data ; ( ii ) there were faint objects for which the low s / n of the spectra prevented measuring meaningful radial velocities",
    ".     observed stellar spectra ( light blue / gray lines ) and the best - fit synthetic data from the @xcite spectrum library ( black lines).,width=302 ]    the spectra were reduced using the standard 2df data reduction pipeline .",
    "we performed continuum normalization for the stellar spectra using the iraf task onedspec.continuum and then cleaned the strongest skyline residuals using linear interpolation of the surrounding continuum .",
    "atmospheric parameters and radial velocity were determined for each star in an iterative process , which combined finding best - fit synthetic spectrum from the @xcite spectrum library , with @xmath52 fitting , and cross - correlating the best - fit model with the observed spectrum to calculate the radial velocity .",
    "this approach is very similar to that adopted by the radial velocity experiment ( rave ) project @xcite , and our analysis is based on the same synthetic library as rave .",
    "earlier results for other star clusters with the same instrument and analysis can be found in @xcite .",
    "because of the wide range of temperatures ( and hence spectral features ) , we needed three subsequent iterations to converge to a stable set of temperatures , surface gravities , metallicities and radial velocities . the latter",
    "are believed to be accurate within @xmath751 - 2 km  s@xmath76 for the cooler stars and @xmath755 km  s@xmath76 for the hotter stars in the sample ( the boundary is roughly at 8000 - 9000 k ) .",
    "these values have been estimated from gaussian fits of the cross - correlation profile using the iraf task rv.fxcor and should only be considered as representative numbers . the atmospheric parameters ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 $ ] , @xmath79 ) , due to their degeneracy , are accurate to about @xmath75300 k and @xmath750.5 dex , with strong correlations ( see @xcite for a thorough discussion of the rave error analysis ) .    to illustrate the difficulties one faces when analysing cool and hot stars together in the ca  ii triplet region , we show sample spectral fits in fig .",
    "[ specfit ] .",
    "since the ca  ii lines almost exactly coincide with hydrogen lines in the paschen series , we found that it was absolutely crucial to have the best - match template for cross - correlation .",
    "a slight template mismatch can easily lead to radial velocity shifts of several km  s@xmath76 at this intermediate spectral resolution and hence one has to be very careful to optimize template selection ( contrary to the commonly used practice in the optical range that the same template is used across a range of spectral subtypes or even types ) .",
    "it is also unavoidable that as soon as the temperature reaches about 9000 k , the broad spectral features will lead to a degraded velocity precision simply because of the broadened cross - correlation profile .",
    "ngc  2451a and b , as reasonably young open clusters , still host a significant number of hotter main sequence stars , possibly resulting in degraded velocity precision for a fraction of stars .",
    "another difficulty was the very high incidence of ca  ii emission ( defined by the excess flux of the calcium lines relative to the best - fit model spectra ) , especially in late - type main sequence stars in the clusters .",
    "both clusters are young , hence the high rotation rates can lead to elevated chromospheric activity , for which the ca  ii lines are good indicators @xcite . when comparing the best - fit models to the observed spectra , we noticed distorted ca  ii profiles for many stars , frequently in the form of central emission components within the lines .",
    "these can introduce random velocity errors of up to 10 - 20 km  s@xmath76 in the maximum of the cross - correlation profile .",
    "this was particularly apparent after modifying the velocity determination for 405 stars with ca  ii line profile irregularities : after excluding the ca  ii lines from cross - correlations , a large fraction of the refined velocities were very close to the cluster s mean velocities ( fig.[fig : radvel_hist ] ) .",
    "we also measured cross - correlation velocities from the lower resolution blue spectra .",
    "these data were less useful because many of the stars have a broad h@xmath46 line and only a few additional weak features in the recorded wavelength range , leading to a broad cross - correlation profile and radial velocities accurate to only about @xmath7510 km  s@xmath76 .",
    "the clusters are in the plane of the milky way so the background contamination overwhelms the cluster members . to estimate the radial velocities of the clusters we need to make some assumptions to separate the probable cluster members from the field based on our present knowledge of the cluster .",
    "based on the young age of the clusters , we assumed that our sample should contain a large number of k and m dwarfs that show chromospheric activity , i.e. , signs of emission in the cat lines .",
    "we identified 405 active red objects in our sample .",
    "several of our target stars show sharp h@xmath46 emission as additional evidence for activity . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : radvel_hist ] we show the equivalent width of h@xmath46 vs radial velocity ( negative ews mean emission ) .",
    "we see two distinct groups of emission line objects in the figures around the approximate position of the radial velocity values of ngc2451 a and b ( 22.7 @xmath80 and 14 @xmath80 ) that were estimated by @xcite .",
    "we show the radial velocity histogram of these stars in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : radvel_hist ] . from this histogram",
    "we calculate mean radial velocities 26.7@xmath81 @xmath80 and 17.4@xmath82 @xmath80 for ngc2451 a and b , respectively . because chromospheric activity is not always present in young stars ( e.g. early type ones ) we use this test only to estimate true cluster velocities .",
    "our average radial velocity values are about 3 km  s@xmath76 higher than those of @xcite . considering the formal standard deviation of the @xcite data ( 2.3 km  s@xmath76 for cluster a and 2.5 km  s@xmath76 for cluster b ) and the small number of member stars in that sample ( 21 for cluster a and 10 for cluster b ) ,",
    "the 3 km  s@xmath76 systematic difference is hardly significant .",
    "given that our sample contains three - to - ten times more members for each cluster , we adopt our mean values for the cluster velocities .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : radvel_hist_all ] we show the radial velocity histogram of our complete sample with log g @xmath83 3 ( giants filtered out ) .",
    "the two peaks at the positions of the radial velocities of the two clusters ( designated with a and b ) are readily distinguishable .",
    "however a large number of contaminating stars might be present due to the strong galactic background so the radial velocity is not enough to determine accurate membership status .",
    "therefore , we used photometric diagrams also to clean our initial sample .",
    "we performed the final determination of memberships as follows .",
    "we selected member candidates using the radial velocity and log g criteria .",
    "we accepted all objects as cluster members that had log g @xmath83 3 ( 1079 out of 2570 objects satisfied this criterion ) and not more than a 2 @xmath84 deviation from the clusters mean radial velocities ( 13.4 @xmath80 @xmath2 v@xmath85 @xmath2 21.4 @xmath80 for ngc2451 b and 21.9 @xmath80 @xmath2 v@xmath85 @xmath2 31.5 @xmath80 for ngc2451 a , 152 and 200 objects for ngc2451 a and b , respectively ) .",

    "the minimum fractional luminosity for the remaining three large excess sources is @xmath105 . for comparison ,",
    "debris disks typically have fractional luminosities below 10@xmath106 @xcite .",
    "in addition , many of these systems are known to have strong spectral features in the mid - infrared , establishing that their emission there is dominated by warm , very finely divided dust ( @xmath46 pic , @xcite ; ngc 2547 id8 and p1121 , gorlova et al . in preparation ; bd + 20 307 , @xcite ; hd 23514 , @xcite ) .",
    "these latter sources represent extreme examples of debris disks containing warm dust .",

    "@xcite report 28 additional systems with dust at t @xmath97 180 k and that dominates the disk emission at 24 @xmath1 .",
    "it is therefore plausible that many of the other large excess systems have substantial emission by warm dust .    although many of the large - excess stars are roughly of solar type , even in this case they are relatively uncommon",
    ". in particular , for the 30 - 130 myr age range , table [ tabl : largeexc ] shows there are only three solar - like extreme excess stars .",
    "they are drawn from a parent population of all the stars observed within this age range and with spectral types between mid - f ( f4 ) and mid - k ( k4 ) , a total of about 250 ( from m47 , @xcite ; the pleiades , @xcite , @xcite , and our unpublished work ; ic 2391 , @xcite ; ngc 2547 , @xcite ; the feps sample , @xcite ; and ngc 2451a&b , this work ) .",
    "that is , the incidence of extreme excess systems among solar - like stars in the 30 - 130myr age range is only about 1% .",
    "the 30 - 130myr age range insures that these extreme excesses are unlikely to originate in the wave of oligarth planet building that peaks around 10 - 15 myr ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "there are alternative possibilities for generating them , however .",
    "one is collisions between large bodies , similar to the collision that led to the formation of the moon @xcite .",
    "it is thought that about three moon masses of material were thrown into orbit around the sun in the impact that formed our moon @xcite .",
    "the rapid injection of such a large mass would produce a signature roughly in agreement with the observations of these large - excess objects ( gorlova et al . in preparation ) .",
    "a rough e - folding time of 2 million years for the dissipation of this mass can be estimated from the calculations of @xcite .",
    "in addition , a process that results in very vigorous gravitational stirring of a dense asteroid belt ( e.g. , through gravitationally resonant orbits of massive planets , @xcite ) is also a candidate to produce huge infrared excesses .",
    "although table [ tabl : largeexc ] contains several early type stars older than 20 myr and with large excesses , none of them is above the decay trend of normal debris disk stars .",
    "in fact , as table [ tabl : largeexc ] emphasizes , all the large - excess early type stars are relatively young and may just still be in the decay of their initial peak debris output .",
    "the placement of the trend line is rather arbitrary .",
    "nevetheless , we have considered why no very large excesses are found for older early - type stars .",
    "we calculated what mass would be needed to cause an excess about 4 times above the stellar photosphere at 24 @xmath1 m in an a star .",
    "we used only grains larger than 6.3 @xmath1 m , because radiation pressure will eject small grains from the system , with terminal velocity @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the mass of the central star , @xmath110 is the radius of the initial orbit of the grain and @xmath46 is the ratio of forces from radiation pressure and gravity .",
    "@xcite showed that the orbiting grains normally dominate the visibility of the debris disk over the blown - out grains . to get the total mass needed to cause the required 24@xmath1 m excess we first assumed that all the flux comes from the smallest grains then we calculated the total surface area of these grains . using the surface area and the @xmath111 grain size distribution",
    "we were able to determine the scaling constant using the following equation    @xmath112    where @xmath113 is the diameter of the smallest grain remaning in the system and @xmath114 is a nominal maximum parent planetesimal size ( 100 m ) .",
    "using the scaling constant we can calculate the total mass by integrating @xmath115 from @xmath113 to @xmath114 .",
    "we found that the total mass needed to produce the excess is on the order of a couple of moon masses . the same calculation for g - type stars with @xmath116 m leads to two orders of magnitude less mass ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "in the case of a stars , radiation pressure clears the small grains from the disk in a few hundred years while these grains remain around the g - star for a few times @xmath118 years @xcite . to quantify the effects of this difference",
    ", we also calculated the scaling factor and the total mass neglecting the effect of blowout for the a star and integrating over the entire size range from @xmath119 m to 100 m .",
    "we found that in this case we would need more than 25 times less material for producing the same level of excess around the a star . in this hypothetical case",
    "the masses needed for a- and g - type stars are the same order of magnitude .",
    "this implies that their ability to eject grains very efficiently through photon pressure plays a large role in the absence of extreme excess around older early type stars.those small grains carry a large surface area ( relative to their mass ) which would make the excess more easily detectable .",
    "a corollary is that large grain production rates around early - type stars will be indicated by large flows of small grains out of the system driven by photon pressure .",

    "we used the data presented in @xcite supplemented with our new datapoints to plot the excess fraction vs age , and found that the excess fraction unexpectedly drops in the range of 30 - 80myr for early type stars while it slightly rises in the same age for late type stars .",

    "<S> we present a spitzer irac and mips survey of ngc 2451 a and b , two open clusters in the 50 - 80 myr age range . </S>",
    "<S> we complement these data with extensive ground - based photometry and spectroscopy to identify the cluster members in the spitzer survey field . </S>",
    "<S> we find only two members with 8 micron excesses . </S>",
    "<S> the incidence of excesses at 24 microns is much higher , 11 of 31 solar - like stars and 1 of 7 early - type ( a ) stars . </S>",
    "<S> this work nearly completes the debris disk surveys with spitzer of clusters in the 30 - 130 myr range . </S>",
    "<S> this range is of interest because it is when large planetesimal collisions may have still been relatively common ( as indicated by the one that led to the formation of the moon during this period of the evolution of the solar system ) . </S>",
    "<S> we review the full set of surveys and find that there are only three possible cases out of about 250 roughly solar - mass stars where very large excesses suggest that such collisions have occurred recently . </S>"
