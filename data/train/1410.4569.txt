    "there is increasing evidence that supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) co - evolve with the bulges of their host galaxies . the tight correlation between the velocity dispersion of stars in the bulge and the mass of the black hole at the center ( m@xmath4",
    "; e.g. , @xcite ) , suggests regulatory feedback ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) from the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , likely in the form of jets or winds .",
    "such winds give rise to blueshifted absorption lines seen in the uv spectra of approximately half of seyfert galaxies ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , commonly the same agn which also show a ` warm absorber ' ( wa ; @xcite ) in their soft x - ray spectra ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "this , along with the similarity of the outflow velocities inferred , suggests that the uv and x - ray absorbers are at least partly related physically and may be different manifestations of the same outflow ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    despite their importance and prevalence , the properties of these agn winds are still not fully understood and their origin within the agn structure is unclear .",
    "two main scenarios suggest that the winds responsible for the warm absorber features are produced at very different locations .",
    "@xcite propose that a multi - temperature wind is formed from photoionized evaporation of material off the inner edge of the torus located at parsec - scales from the central smbh .",
    "however , @xcite suggests that a wind emerges vertically from a narrow region on the accretion disk at @xmath5 ( corresponding to @xmath6  pc for a @xmath7 black hole ) and is radially accelerated by radiation pressure and bent to an angle of @xmath8 .",
    "such a wind may produce the signature of a warm absorber at pc - scales when it collides with the shell of gas that has been swept up by radiation pressure and surrounds the black hole at 1100  pc @xcite .",
    "determining the radial distance of the absorbing material from the central smbh is therefore crucial for understanding its origin within the agn structure .",
    "however , this quantity is not directly measurable ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "since the thickness of the absorber can not exceed its distance from the smbh an absolute maximum distance can be determined ( @xmath9 ; @xcite ) .",
    "a minimum can be estimated from the size of the civ broad - line region as this is always at least partially covered ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) or by assuming the outflow is travelling at the local escape velocity ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "more stringent limits can be obtained from absorption of excited states ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) or from variability of the absorption . in particular ,",
    "if the absorbers do not respond to changes in the ionizing continuum , an upper limit on the density of the absorber is obtained , giving a lower limit on its radial distance .",
    "variability has been observed previously in wa ; indeed , the first wa was identified after an apparent increase in the absorption column density ( @xmath10 ) occurred over @xmath11  yr in mr  2251 - 178 @xcite .",
    "further observations with _",
    "asca _ showed variations in @xmath10 and the ionization parameter ( @xmath12 ) on timescales of months to yrs , which were explained by material moving in and out of the line - of - sight @xcite .",
    "however , absorption in this agn has also been observed to remain stable over a period of @xmath13  yrs since 2002 @xcite .",
    "there are many other examples of agn whose wa show variability , covering a range of timescales . for example , short timescale absorption variability was observed in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , with a factor of 2 increase in @xmath10 seen over a period of 3 weeks @xcite , changes in individual absorption lines have been observed over days @xcite , and occultation events have been observed to occur over @xmath14 hrs @xcite .",
    "longer timescale variability is observed in mrk  348 , with a decrease in @xmath10 and @xmath12 in some of its absorption components occurring over 6 yrs @xcite , and mrk  704 shows very large changes ( up to factors of @xmath15 depending upon which spectral model is adopted ) in the covering factor , @xmath16 , @xmath10 , and @xmath12 over 3  yrs @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite report the re - emergence of a wa in mrk  335 after @xmath17  yrs of observations in which no absorption was detected , indicating both large and long - term variations .",
    "ngc  3516 shows absorption which is variable over a range of timescales with an occultation occurring over hours @xcite , changes in ionization state occurring over months @xcite and the appearance of fast kinematic components happening after years @xcite .",
    "however , similar to mr  2251 - 178 , other agn show periods in which their wa do not appear to vary ; e.g. ,  ngc  5548 has shown periods of 3  yrs ( 19992002 ) with no apparent change in its properties @xcite , but others ( 20022005 ) do show a decrease in the ionization @xcite .",
    "later monitoring of this agn in 2007 with _",
    "suzaku _ over month - timescales again shows the wa properties to be stable , despite large variations in the continuum flux @xcite .",
    "recent monitoring with _ xmm - newton _ during 2013 shows the nucleus of ngc  5548 to be obscured by a long - lasting , clumpy stream of ionized gas , thus leading to a further change in the x - ray absorption @xcite .",
    "the absorption components in mrk  509 do not show short - term variation over a monitoring period of 36 days , despite an increase in soft x - ray flux of 60% during the campaign .",
    "no long - term ( 3 to 9 yrs ) changes are detected either , suggesting the absorbing material lies at large ( @xmath18pc ) distances from the black hole @xcite .",
    "intrinsic uv absorption has also been observed to vary in many sources , due to changes in the ionization state of the material or motion of material across the line of sight giving a variable column density ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "ngc  3783 is a nearby ( @xmath19 ; @xcite ) , optically bright ( @xmath20  mag ) seyfert  1 with a black hole mass of @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "it has been studied extensively in the band and has a strong x - ray warm absorber ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the first high - resolution grating observations from _ chandra _ showed many blueshifted , narrow absorption lines from hydrogen- and helium - like ions of ar , s , si , mg , ne , and o , and l - shell transitions of fe  xvii to fe  xxi as well as weak emission lines from o and ne @xcite",
    ". further photoionization calculations indicated these were due to two phases of gas with different covering factors and different ionization levels @xcite .",
    "@xcite  ( @xcite ; hereafter k02 ) presented a high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) , high - resolution x - ray spectrum from 900  ks of _ chandra _ data obtained in 2001 .",
    "narrow absorption lines from fe , ca , ar , s , si , al , mg , ne , o , n , and c were again identified , with an average outflow velocity of @xmath22 .",
    "the lines showed an asymmetry in their profiles , thought to be due to the two separate absorbing systems .",
    "absorption lines from lower ionization state ions were also observed , along with m shell transitions of fe .",
    "global photoionization modelling of this data set by @xcite found it to be best described by three distinct absorption components with a large range in ionization state ( @xmath23 ) @xcite and @xmath24 @xcite.[ionnote ] ] , but a narrower range in column density ( @xmath25 ) , with each split into two kinematic components .",
    "however , the same data set was modelled by @xcite using only a two - phase absorber ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) and the same outflow velocity for each component ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "similar models were found for _ xmm - newton _ reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ; @xcite ) data in which absorption lines from fe , ar , s , si , mg , ne , o , n , and c were all identified .",
    "two phases of gas , with @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and an outflow velocity of @xmath31 were used @xcite .",
    "@xcite improved upon the traditional multi - component modelling by reconstructing a continuous distribution of column density with ionization parameter , also found in other seyfert outflows @xcite .",
    "no short - term variability of the absorption was found in either the _ chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ data .",
    "the lack of response by the absorbers to changes in the continuum allowed lower distance limits of @xmath32  pc to be placed on the components found in the _ chandra _ data @xcite , and @xmath33  pc and @xmath34  pc for the high and low ionization components identified in the _ xmm - newton _",
    "data @xcite .",
    "longer timescale variations were observed with early _ asca _ data when the opacity of the wa decreased by a factor of @xmath35 over an 18 month period @xcite .",
    "changes in the ionization and column density may have also occurred in the 8 yrs between 2001 and a _ suzaku _ observation in 2009 @xcite .",
    "the wa shows no signs of variability within this 210  ks observation @xcite .",
    "ngc  3783 was the subject of an intensive monitoring campaign in the uv from @xmath36 . combining 18 epochs from the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ; @xcite ) on board the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) and 5 epochs from the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
    "( _ fuse _ ) , @xcite  ( @xcite ; hereafter g03a ) presented a high s / n spectrum covering @xmath37 .",
    "this showed blueshifted absorption from ovi , nv , civ , niii , ciii * and ly@xmath2 to ly@xmath38 and the previously detected kinematic components with outflow velocities of @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( components  1 & 2 ; @xcite ) , @xmath41 ( 3 ; @xcite ) , and @xmath42 ( 4 ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite  ( @xcite ; hereafter g03b ) also found component 1 to be decelerating , and that the deceleration was increasing .",
    "this may be due to the directional shift of an absorber with respect to our line of sight or different regions of a continuous flow crossing our sightline .",
    "no decelerations were detected in the other kinematic components .",
    "component 1 has also been shown to be composed of two distinct , but co - located regions ( 1a and 1b ; @xcite ) .",
    "modelling by @xcite found an ionization parameter of @xmath43 for the uv components 1b , 2 , and 3 , which is consistent with that of the lowest - ionization x - ray absorber and distances of the components were estimated to be @xmath44pc , @xmath45pc and @xmath46pc .",
    "the wealth of high s / n , high - resolution spectroscopy available for ngc  3783 has allowed a detailed characterization of its extremely rich x - ray absorption spectrum and uv absorbing material . our aim is to extend the work of these studies and investigate the variability of the absorption to determine how the material evolves over long timescales .",
    "we therefore obtained a new 170  ks _ chandra _ high - energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ; @xcite ) observation ( taken in 2013 ) to compare with the 900  ks archival spectrum from 2001 in order to study the evolution of the absorbers over more than a decade at high - resolution .",
    "previous high - resolution studies of ngc  3783 have only probed timescales of up to @xmath11  yr .",
    "we also obtained new _",
    "hst _ cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ; @xcite ) data taken within a few days of our x - ray observation to investigate similar long - term variation in the uv absorption , and further investigate the relationship between the x - ray and uv absorbers .",

    "we summarize our conclusions in  [ section : sum ] .",
    "ngc  3783 has been observed by _",
    "@xcite once in 2000 and extensively in 2001 , resulting in a combined exposure time of 888.1  ks .",
    "these data were originally reported in k02 and are re - analyzed here . in this work",
    "we also report results from two new _ chandra _ observations taken in march 2013 with a combined exposure time of 160.7  ks .",
    "details of all these observations are given in table  [ table : obslog ] .",
    "._chandra _ observation log [ cols=\"<,<,<,^,^ \" , ]     in all three of the uv absorption profiles , kinematic component  1 , which was very strong in epoch  2 ( 2001 ) has completely disappeared by epoch  6 ( 2013 ) .",
    "similarly , component  4 , which was not present in epoch  2 , appears in all three profiles in epoch  6 .",
    "while this may simply be due to the strengthening and weakening of physically distinct absorption components , g03b reported a deceleration of component  1 .",
    "quoted on figure  [ fig : hst_vel ] are the velocity shifts measured from the minima of the absorption troughs and the inferred decelerations , assuming these remain constant over the full 12 yr period .",
    "we find a velocity shift of @xmath47 corresponding to a deceleration of @xmath48 .",
    "this is lower than the average deceleration reported by g03b , but they did find a change in the deceleration within their observations ( @xmath49 between epochs @xmath50 and @xmath51 between @xmath52 ) .",
    "the apparent depth of the absorption trough now at component  4 is similar to that which was at component  1 , supporting the idea that it may be due to the same physical absorption component .",
    "however , the profile shape appears strongly asymmetric in epoch  6 and the nv profile suggests this may be due to a superposition of two separate components . while this could be due to the sub - components of component  1 having different decelerations , the asymmetry is also clearly observed in the siiv profile which is not expected to be the case in such a scenario .",
    "this will be discussed further in j.  gabel et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the nv and civ profiles both show a strong velocity component  3 in their epoch  2 spectra , which is weak , or even no longer present in epoch  6 .",
    "similarly , component  2 is weak in epoch  2 , but strong in epoch  6 .",
    "component  2 is also weakly present in the siiv profile in epoch  6 . in the case of civ ,",
    "component  4 from the longer - wavelength member of the doublet is expected to appear at the same outflow velocity as component  2 , possibly distorting the profile , but the nv profile which shows similar general effects , suffers from no such contamination .",
    "these observations may again be due to the independent strengthening and weakening of different absorption components , particularly as the the two absorption profiles show different shapes , the one in epoch  6 being both narrower and deeper ; however the total area of each remains similar .",
    "this may suggest that component  3 has decelerated to the velocity shift of component  2 .",
    "no deceleration of this component was found in the initial study by g03b , but the deceleration implied would be @xmath53 , corresponding to a velocity change of only @xmath54 between epochs  1 and 3 investigated by g03b .",
    "such a shift would not have been detected due to the wide absorption trough of this component ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "+      the uv velocity profiles indicate significant changes in the 12 yr period between the observations , possibly due to radial deceleration of the absorbing material .",
    "such changes are not apparent in the x - ray velocity profiles ; the broad profile shapes remain similar between epochs and no velocity shifts are detected significant at @xmath56 .",
    "the possible velocity shifts in the uv are @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "although the typical errors in the x - ray velocity estimates are only @xmath59 , the widths of the profiles are very broad , @xmath60 in each epoch , and few are instrumentally resolved .",
    "therefore it is unlikely that velocity shifts of these sizes would be detectable in the x - ray velocity profiles . assuming typical errors on the central velocity of @xmath61 and @xmath62 on the 2001 and 2013 meg profiles , respectively , only velocity shifts as large as @xmath63 would be detected with @xmath64 significance in the x - ray data .",
    "the uv data indicate shifts smaller than this value , which are therefore unlikely to be detected in the x - ray data whether present or not .    in figure",
    "[ fig : vel_combined ] we compare the x - ray velocity profile produced from the absorption lines of h- and he - like mg to the uv velocity profile for nv(1239 ) .",
    "we use mg as it has one of the highest s / n x - ray profiles ( along with si ) , but a higher resolution ( @xmath65 compared with @xmath66 ) .",
    "we use nv as the overlap of the features from the two doublet members is lower than for civ . while we show only one profile , the combined profiles from each of the four combinations of mg / si and civ / nv , yield similar results . the top panel shows the 2001 data , with the x - ray data shown by the black open circles and the uv data shown by the smooth black curve .",

    "the blue arrows indicate the locations of the four uv kinematic components identified in the 2001 data by g03a .",
    "as seen in previous works ( e.g. ,  k02 ; g03a ) , the x - ray and uv velocity profiles appear broadly similar , suggesting that it may simply be the poorer resolution of the x - ray profile which limits our detection of relatively small kinematic changes .",
    "figure  [ fig : vel_combined ] shows that the broad x - ray profile may be a superposition of all four uv kinematic components , with the asymmetry in the 2001 profiles being due to a strong uv component  1 .",
    "the small differences observed between the profiles are likely due to them probing different material .",
    "the x - ray profiles are constructed primarily of absorption lines from higher ionization state ions , whereas the uv profiles show absorption due to lower ionization state ions which may reside in different physical absorption components .",
    "however , photoionization modelling of both the 2001 x - ray and uv spectra indicates that the lowest - ionization x - ray absorber is consistent with the higher ionization uv absorbers ( components 1b , 2 , and 3 ) , suggesting a physical connection between at least some of the x - ray and uv absorbing material @xcite .",

    "a similar ( @xmath132 ) drop in the @xmath133 uv flux is shown in figure  [ fig : uv_spec ] .",
    "the change in x - ray flux is consistent with previous variations observed by _ rxte _",
    "( see the long - term lightcurve presented in figure  [ fig : lc ] ) .",
    "2 .   figure  [ fig : full_x_spec ] also shows a significant flattening of the power - law slope from @xmath134 in 2001 , to @xmath135 in 2013 .",
    "we show that this is unlikely to be the result of an increased reflection component , although our data do not extend to the higher energies required to model this in detail .",
    "we also found no strong evidence for a large increase in the column density of the absorbing material , although smaller variations which we are unable to detect could contribute to a change in @xmath79 .",
    "the observed variation could also simply be due to intrinsic variations within the continuum source itself .",
    "3 .   of the 19 individual absorption lines that we consider in  [ section : lines ]",
    ", we find none with a significant variation in their line flux or ew between the 2001 and 2013 spectra .",
    "we therefore suggest that there are no dramatic changes in the covering factor , column density or ionization state of the absorbing material .",
    "4 .   we do not find any significant change in the x - ray kinematics between the two epochs .",
    "the average outflow velocities inferred from individual absorption lines ( @xmath136 , @xmath137 ) and the average values determined from the velocity profiles ( see  [ section : kinematics ] ; @xmath138 , @xmath139 ) are all consistent .",
    "the widths of the velocity profiles are also consistent in each epoch ; @xmath140 , @xmath141 . 5 .",
    "we do see significant changes in the uv kinematics between the two epochs , with kinematic components  1 and 3 being much weaker in 2013 , while components  4 and 2 are much stronger .",
    "this may be due to radial deceleration of the material with component  1 decelerating to the location of component  4 with @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) and component  3 decelerating to the location of component  2 with @xmath144 ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "6 .   despite the different behavior apparently observed in the x - ray and uv kinematics ,",
    "we show that when the uv data are downgraded to the velocity resolution of the x - ray data , very similar velocity profiles are obtained .",
    "this suggests a connection between at least some of the x - ray and uv outflowing material , in agreement with previous works .",
    "we detect a narrow fe k@xmath2 emission line at 6.4  kev in both data sets .",
    "we find no significant variation between the epochs , with the ew and flux estimates consistent within @xmath72 ; @xmath146 ev , @xmath147 ev and @xmath148 , @xmath149 .",
    "the widths of the lines are also consistent ( @xmath150 , @xmath151 ) and using simple virial arguments , the radial distance of the material producing the iron line is found to be @xmath152 light days or 0.026  pc from the central black hole .",
    "this places the material within the inner edge of the torus but beyond the broad - line region .    in general",
    ", the physical properties of the x - ray wa in ngc  3783 appear to have remained remarkably stable between the _ chandra _ hetgs observations in 2001 and 2013 .",
    "this lack of significant absorption variation suggests that the absorbers lie far from the central smbh , consistent with previous lower limits i.e. ,  @xmath32  pc @xcite and @xmath153  pc @xcite .",
    "this places the absorbers at distances much greater than the blr ( @xmath116  pc ; @xcite ) and the inner edge of the torus ( @xmath118  pc ; @xcite ) and hence , taken at face value , they do not appear to be commensurate with either a disk - wind origin @xcite or photoionization off of the inner torus edge @xcite .",
    "however , the torus does extend to larger distances , with half - light radii of @xmath154  pc ( major axis ) and @xmath155  pc ( minor axis ) estimated by mid - infrared interferometry @xcite , suggesting that the wa may still be related to this structure .",
    "the wa we currently observe could also have originated as a disk - wind , but travelled for many years to its current , more distant location further from the agn .",
    "this is a scenario more consistent with that suggested by @xcite in which the wind collides with a shell of gas surrounding the smbh , which rapidly slows and cools , producing an observable wa . for ngc  3783",
    "this gas is expected to lie at @xmath156  pc ( determined from equation 8 of @xcite , and using a velocity dispersion of @xmath157 from @xcite ) , which may be too distant to explain the wa observed here , but since we only have lower limits on its distance , this can not be stated with certainty .",
    "@xcite also gave an upper limit of @xmath158  pc , consistent with both this scenario , and with the expected location of the uv absorbers @xcite .",
    "while we find no statistically significant variations in the physical properties of the x - ray wa between our observations , we note that @xcite did report a decrease in the opacity by a factor of @xmath35 over an 18 month period .",
    "this is not necessarily in conflict with our results as the observations occurred over a different time interval ( 19931996 ) to the data we consider here .",
    "it is also not unprecedented for agn to show periods of stability and variability with regards to their absorption properties ; e.g.  ngc  5548 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that agn can host absorbing material with a range of physical properties and distances from the central smbh , producing variations on a wide range of timescales .",
    "while the x - ray absorption properties lack significant variation , the uv absorbers show clear kinematic changes .",
    "however , this does not necessarily indicate that the x - ray and uv absorbing material is not physically related as we show that such changes would simply not be detected in the lower velocity resolution x - ray data .",
    "the dramatic uv variability observed on @xmath159  yr timescales can be reasonably expected to continue , suggesting that further monitoring of ngc  3783 in the uv is likely to yield stronger constraints on the outflow physics .",
    "the kinematic change in uv component 1 was first observed in data from 2001 but the potential deceleration of uv component 3 has required a longer baseline for detection due to its smaller magnitude .",
    "constraining changes in this deceleration , as seen in component 1 , would require an even longer baseline .",
    "further observations would also allow more detailed discrimination between the various scenarios suggested for the deceleration ; e.g.  a bulk deceleration of the material or a directional shift in the motion of the absorber with respect to our line of sight .",
    "the lack of variation seen in the x - ray wa suggests that constant monitoring will be required over many years to constrain fully its nature . such a campaign is impractical with _",
    "chandra _ owing to the long required exposures ; a better approach would be to trigger grating observations in response to continuous monitoring at lower spectral resolution with , e.g. ,  _",
    "swift_. regular monitoring at high resolution would be an excellent and feasible program for the forthcoming _ athena _ x - ray observatory .",
