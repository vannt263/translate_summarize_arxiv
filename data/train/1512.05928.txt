    "the theoretical modelling of large - strain elasto - plasticity for polycrystalline materials poses many challenges and , despite its great importance , no fully satisfactory mathematical theory has emerged so far .",
    "works in this direction include for instance  @xcite as well as the monographs  @xcite .",
    "some major issues in the quest for such a theory are the following : first , elasto - plasticity naturally goes beyond what can be modeled in a traditional continuum mechanics framework .",
    "rather , a body undergoing plastic flow does _ not _ remain a continuum as the material is internally `` ripped and torn '' , even if this is not macroscopically observable .",
    "even if one is not interested in precisely describing the microscopic origins of plastic flow ( such as dislocation movement in metals , see for instance  @xcite ) , some aspects of the microscopic situation need to be taken into account in order to derive a consistent theory .",
    "more advanced mathematical structures such as lie groups and lie algebras , can be very effective in describing the relationships between macroscopic and microscopic phenomena , but are rarely used in the engineering literature ( but see  @xcite ) .",
    "second , when deriving the full dynamics of the material , it is often unclear how the solid - like elastic deformations and the fluid - like plastic deformations interact . in particular",
    ", their relative speed plays an important role , but this does not seem to be used at present for plasticity modelling .",
    "third , elasto - plastic flow is rate - dependent ( viscous ) in reality , but only slightly so , and thus rate - independent ( quasi - static ) approximations are used more often than not .",
    "however , this simplification creates the serious problem that the regularity of solution processes can only be low in general since _ jumps _ ( relative to the `` slow '' time scale ) can occur in rate - independent processes  at least there is no obvious mechanism preventing this _ a - priori_. this creates the need to specify the behavior of the evolution on the jump transients , which is important for the global energetics , but rarely considered .    the present work develops , from first principles , a model of macroscopic elasto - plasticity that aims to addresses the above issues , and then to analyze it .",
    "our approach is based on the following key principles :    1 .",
    "macroscopic deformations are modeled as driven by microscopic slips ( e.g.  slips induced by dislocation movement ) , an idea taken from single - crystal plasticity .",
    "this idea can be abstractly expressed using the theory of lie groups and their lie algebras : a matrix from a lie group represents the macroscopic plastic distortion and hence ( part of ) the internal state of the material .",
    "the plastic flow , however , is specified on the level of the associated `` microscopic '' lie algebra ( i.e.  the tangent space at the identity matrix ) as the sum of microscopic _ drifts _ ( slip rates ) acting as _ infinitesimal generators _ of the flow .",
    "the main advantage of the lie - theoretic point of view expressed in this work is that on the microscopic lie algebra level we are dealing with a _ linear _ structure .",
    "elastic movements are assumed to be infinitely fast relative to the plastic ones , which is quite realistic  @xcite , so we base the model on the postulate that the system minimizes over all admissible _ elastic _ , but not plastic , deformations .",
    "the plastic dynamics are first modeled as _ rate - dependent _",
    ", i.e.  _ viscous_. if the system is spontaneously pushed out of a stable ( rest ) state , it _ relaxes _ to stability by following an evolutionary flow rule . unlike other models ( see below for comparisons ) , here we do not rely on minimization over irreversible movements , which is thermodynamically questionable . in particular ,",
    "we work with the realistic _ local _",
    "stability ( yield ) condition in the slow - loading limit .",
    "4 .   the combined elasto - plastic dynamics are modeled based on a two - stage time - stepping scheme , which alternates between two `` fundamental motions '' : purely elastic minimization and elasto - plastic relaxation , the latter exchanging elastic for plastic distortion without modifying the total deformation .",
    "this two - stage approach allows for a very clean modeling without any ambiguity as to which test functions should be considered in the principle of virtual power .",
    "5 .   via a slow - loading limit passage",
    "we arrive at the limit `` two - speed '' formulation , which incorporates two time scales : with respect to the `` slow '' time , the formulation is rate-_independent_. on jump transients , however , we retain the possibility of rate - dependent evolution ( or a mixture of rate - dependent and rate - independent evolution ) with respect to the `` fast '' time .",
    "6 .   we formulate the whole model in the reference frame , but point out how the common formulation with structural ( intermediate ) tensors is essentially equivalent via lie group adjoints .",
    "we do not use the idea of an `` intermediate ( structural ) space '' since one can not consistently define `` intermediate points '' .    if @xmath0 denotes the total deformation of our specimen , then the commonly used krner ",
    "lee decomposition @xmath1 splits the deformation gradient into elastic and plastic _ distortions _ @xmath2 ; since @xmath2 are not in general curl - free , they might not be deformation gradients themselves .",
    "we refer to   @xcite for justifications and various other aspects of this decomposition .",
    "note in particular that if @xmath3 , then @xmath4 can not be the identity map ; this expresses the physical constraint that the elastic deformation has to close the gaps opened by the plastic flow so as to restore a macroscopic continuum .",
    "the multiplicative krner ",
    "lee decomposition is at the root of many mathematical challenges in large - strain theories of elasto - plasticity .",
    "not only is it incompatible with our traditional linear function spaces , the splitting of @xmath5 into @xmath4 and @xmath6 furthermore is clearly not unique .",
    "the ensuing ambiguity ( often called the `` uniqueness problem '' in the literature ) is a big obstacle when trying to develop a useful mathematical theory .",
    "for instance , if for the moment we consider the macroscopic elasto - plastic flow to be divided into a number of time intervals @xmath7 , @xmath8 , then in every such interval we have potentially both an elastic and a plastic distortion , @xmath9 say .",
    "macroscopically , the total plastic distortion should be @xmath10 .",
    "however , if we let @xmath11 ( the interval size going to zero ) , even this `` natural '' setup seems to lead to the need for infinite products , which is not feasible due to the non - commutativity of matrix multiplication .",
    "for example , an approach using matrix logarithms to transform products into sums runs into trouble since the involved matrices are not necessarily symmetric and positive definite , whereby the matrix logarithm might not be uniquely definable .",
    "we here posit that the plastic distortion @xmath6 can only be determined from the internal state of the material and its flow in time needs to be specified through a differential equation , see  @xcite some discussion on this point .",
    "this approach removes all ambiguity in the krner  lee decomposition .",
    "another feature of the present model , reminiscent of recent work by reina & conti  @xcite , is that we study the structure of microscopic slips via a reasoning with functions of bounded variation ( see  @xcite ) whose derivative contains an absolute continuous ( elastic ) part and a singular ( plastic ) part . on the microscopic level",
    "these two parts must decompose _ additively _ since they take place in different parts of the material ( bulk and surface parts , respectively ) . in the macroscopic `` homogenized '' theory , however , this separation is lost and we keep track of the plastic distortion rate ( speed ) via an equation in the `` microscopic '' lie group .",
    "previous mathematical theories for large - strain elasto - plasticity seem to fall into one of two categories : the first , _ energetic _ , approach was introduced in  @xcite and applied to nonlinear elasto - plasticity in  @xcite .",
    "it starts from a time discretization and assumes that the system at every time step minimizes the potential energy plus any dissipational cost that may be incurred by jumping to the target state .",
    "in the limit , a global form of the stability ( yield ) condition and an energy balance can be derived ( these two conditions alone , however , can have more solutions than the original time - discrete scheme , see  @xcite ) . the global , dissipative minimization in the time - stepping scheme assumes infinite foresight of the system since one may jump to an ( energetically ) far - away state , even if there is a potential energy barrier in the way , so the system can in fact jump `` too early '' and `` too far '' . moreover , from a physical perspective , minimization over _ irreversible _ ( dissipative ) movements seems to be a violation of the _ second law of thermodynamics_. nevertheless , if these assumptions are a good approximation to the physical situation at hand , then a very mature theory is available ; the current state - of - the - art is presented in the recent monograph  @xcite , also see  @xcite for a global variational principles in this context .",
    "a more recent approach to address the _ under - specification _ of the system s behavior on jump transients is to add a _ vanishing viscosity _",
    "term  @xcite .",
    "besides the question of what shape of viscosity one should use ( which , however , sometimes turns out to be unimportant ) , the mathematical analysis here is still unfinished and only some special cases of elasto - plastic evolutions can be fully analyzed , usually without infinite - dimensional elastic variables .",
    "our approximation scheme is closer in spirit to the vanishing viscosity approach and in some cases could be equivalent .",
    "however , we try to argue from first principles and only using a time rescaling together with the postulates outlined above .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : after a detailed explanation of the modeling in sections  [ sc : kinematics][sc : evolution ] , we then in section  [ sc : limit ] embark on a detailed , yet mathematically non - rigorous , investigation into the slow - loading limit passage .",
    "these calculations shed some light on the total energetic / dissipative behavior of the system and form the basis of a full mathematically rigorous analysis .",
    "such an analysis is the subject of future work , but at present many formidable technical challenges remain .",
    "we start at the microscopic level and with the non - continuum origins of plastic deformations .",
    "then we consider the macroscopic kinematics , which are linked to the microscopic picture through some basic lie group theory .",
    "consider an open and bounded `` microscopic '' reference domain @xmath12 , @xmath13 , undergoing plastic deformation .",
    "assume without loss of generality that @xmath14 and that there is a ( restricted ) hyperplane , @xmath15 , defined through its normal vector @xmath16 , @xmath17 , that splits @xmath18 into the two parts @xmath19 we assume that the microscopic plastic deformation manifests itself through a translation of @xmath20 in a referential ( relative to the undeformed material ) direction @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 perpendicular to @xmath25 ) and with speed @xmath26 at time @xmath27 .",
    "the situation is illustrated in figure  [ fig : microslip ] .",
    "hence , the corresponding * simple slip * @xmath28 expressing the deformation after time @xmath27 is @xmath29 if such a simple slip was to occur in a macroscopic state , it would be called a _ shear band _ ,",
    "i.e.  a shear motion over an infinitely thin plane , but we here assume it takes place on a microscopic scale and might not be visible macroscopically .",
    "the space derivative of @xmath30 in the bv - sense is the matrix - valued _ measure _ @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the @xmath33-dimensional lebesgue measure ( the ordinary @xmath33-dimensional volume ) and @xmath34 denotes the @xmath35-dimensional hausdorff measure ( the @xmath35-dimensional area ) on @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the @xmath38 identity matrix .",
    "consequently , @xmath30 is a * ( special ) function of bounded variation*. we refer to  @xcite for information on this important class of functions and to  @xcite for a justification of the krner  lee decomposition based on a similar argument .",
    "a `` differentiated '' view on this simple slip is the following : for the * plastic distortion * @xmath39 ( here there is no elastic distortion ) , we may derive the following differential equation : @xmath40 ,        \\qquad t > 0 , \\\\",
    "p(0 ) & = i ,    \\end{aligned}\\right.\\ ] ] which we understand as @xmath41        & & \\text{$({\\mathcal{h}}^{d-1 } { \\begin{picture}(10,8)\\put(2,0){\\line(0,1){7}}\\put(1.8,0){\\line(1,0){7}}\\end{picture}}h)$-almost every $ x \\in \\omega$ and $ t > 0 $ , } \\\\",
    "p(0,x ) & = i               & & \\text{$({\\mathcal{l}}^d + { \\mathcal{h}}^{d-1 } { \\begin{picture}(10,8)\\put(2,0){\\line(0,1){7}}\\put(1.8,0){\\line(1,0){7}}\\end{picture}}h)$-almost every $ x \\in \\omega$. }   \\end{aligned } \\right.\\ ] ] in particular , at every time @xmath42 , a material vector @xmath43 from the tangent space to @xmath18 at a point in @xmath36 is changed with the rate @xmath44 notice that the referential vector @xmath24 is transformed into a `` structural '' vector @xmath45 .",
    "this corresponds to the assumption that the slip direction @xmath24 is given with respect to the material frame , which is also natural since the hyperplane @xmath36 is specified in the material frame ( there are no `` structural points '' as detailed below ) and we need @xmath23 .",
    "however , it is also possible to construct a `` structural '' formulation , but this leads to an equivalent theory , see section  [ ssc : ref_struct ] .",
    "the above linear matrix differential equation can be solved explicitly using the matrix exponential function ( notice that in this special case all `` generator '' matrices @xmath46 commute and @xmath47 since @xmath23 ) : @xmath48 as expected .",
    "one can generalize the preceding discussion as follows : we postulate that also in the general situation , the plastic distortion @xmath49 at time @xmath50 is given via the * plastic distortion equation * @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a @xmath53-matrix field ( or even a measure ) called the * ( referential ) plastic drift*. in the case of the simple slip above , @xmath54 in metals undergoing plastic distortion , @xmath52 arises from ( activated ) crystal defects that move around in the material , causing slip .",
    "since @xmath52 by definition is a matrix in the _ referential _ frame , the equation   simply expresses that the referential drift , given by @xmath52 , transformed to the plastically distorted configuration is equal to the change in the latter .",
    "often , one considers only plastic drifts @xmath52 that are a superposition of simple slips ( for example all activated slip systems in crystal plasticity ) .",
    "all these slips have trace - free generators ( @xmath55 with @xmath23 ) and so in this case we require @xmath52 to be _ deviatoric _ : @xmath56 from the general formula @xmath57 and  , we get @xmath58 hence in this case the * plastic incompressibility * @xmath59 holds .    it should be remarked that if @xmath52 is a sum of constant - in - time drifts ( e.g.  several different simple slips ) , @xmath60 , then the evolution of @xmath6 is given as @xmath61 this , is however _ not _ equal to @xmath62 , because in general the matrices @xmath63 do not commute . to compute this expression , one would need to expand using the baker  campbell  hausdorff formula , which involves the commutator brackets @xmath64 $ ] ( @xmath65 ) , see for example chapter  3 in  @xcite .",
    "this simple observation already shows that due to the _ non - commutativity _ of drifts , we need to employ lie group theory to make sense of the evolution of @xmath6 .    if , as is common in much of the engineering literature ( see for instance  @xcite ) , we instead worked with the * structural drift * @xmath66 , from   we have that @xmath67 so our @xmath52 is just the corresponding referential tensor for the structural tensor @xmath68 .",
    "we now move from the microscopic to the macroscopic picture . starting with an open ,",
    "bounded reference configuration @xmath69 of material , we denote the * referential ( lagrange , material ) points * in it as @xmath70 . under an elasto - plastic deformation @xmath71 , every referential point @xmath72 is mapped to a * spatial ( euler ) point * @xmath73 , where the time @xmath50 is from an interval @xmath74 .",
    "a fundamental modeling assumption in this work ( as in all of the continuum theory of plasticity ) is the following :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ macroscopically , the elastically and plastically deformed body is again a continuum without interpenetration of matter or holes ; thus @xmath75 is a homeomorphism , that is , @xmath76 is continuous , bijective , and the inverse @xmath77 is itself continuous . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    for the sake of mathematical rigor",

    "let us also adopt a simplifying _ notational convention _ : we leave out the arguments @xmath50 and @xmath72 to any quantity such as @xmath76 whenever this does not cause any confusion .",
    "so , we write @xmath76 instead of @xmath84 ; the meaning should be clear from the context .    from physical reasoning",
    "we further require that no non - zero vector is mapped to the zero vector under the push - forward @xmath5 and that orientations are preserved .",
    "hence , we require @xmath85    fundamental to all geometrically nonlinear modeling in finite - strain elasto - plasticity is the multiplicative * krner  lee decomposition *  @xcite @xmath86 here , @xmath4 and @xmath6 correspond to the * elastic distortion * and * plastic distortion * , respectively .",
    "the basic underlying assumption is that the plastic distortion is given as the `` base '' and the elastic distortion happens `` on top of '' the plastic distortion .    in general ,",
    "@xmath87 whence we can only speak of @xmath2 as `` distortions '' ( this terminology is from  @xcite ) and not deformation gradients ( there are no corresponding @xmath88 ) .",
    "we think of this in the following way : if @xmath6 is piecewise constant , everywhere except for the boundaries between different constancy domains , it is a _ local _ gradient of a piecewise - affine plastic deformation .",
    "however , the different affine pieces do not have to fit together without creating holes or overlaps . since _ globally _ we assume that we end up with a continuum of mass again",
    ", these deformations have to be _ elastically corrected_. consequently , plastically distorted bodies sometimes can not fully elastically unload : if @xmath3 , then @xmath89 is impossible since otherwise we would have @xmath90 , which is a contradiction .    in a more abstract fashion",
    ", we can consider there to be a _ vector bundle _",
    "( see chapter  10 of  @xcite for a formal definition ) over the manifold @xmath91 , which we denote by @xmath92 and call the * structural space * , such that at every time @xmath42 and every point @xmath79 the associated vector space @xmath93 contains the * structural vectors*. then , the pushforward @xmath94 splits into a plastic distortion @xmath95 and an elastic distortion @xmath96 .",
    "the maps @xmath97 act on vectors in natural coordinates as multiplication with the respective matrices , also denoted by @xmath97 .",
    "sometimes , the engineering literature refers to the `` structural ( intermediate ) configuration '' between plastic and elastic distortions .",
    "this , however , can only be understood in the sense of transformation of _ vectors _ as before , but it is meaningless to transform points @xmath79 as there are no `` structural points '' ( see section  [ ssc : ref_struct ] for more on this ) .    in our model , which is based on an explicit flow for the plastic part , @xmath4 only occurs as a _ derived _",
    "quantity , @xmath98 therefore , the issue of which invariances should be required of @xmath2 , which is much discussed in the literature  @xcite , is not relevant here .",
    "the _ local _ state space contains all possible current states of the system at a given material point @xmath79 . for the plastic distortion",
    ", we assume the existence of a real matrix lie group @xmath99 ( that is , a group of matrices under matrix multiplication that is also a manifold such that multiplication and inversion are smooth operations ) , which we call the * plastic distortion group * , and require @xmath100 thus , the full signatures of @xmath2 are @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "while the introduction of lie group theory introduces some additional notation , it greatly clarifies some concepts and allows to consistently describe the signatures of many quantities occurring in the model .    in metals ,",
    "plastic distortions are caused by the glide of microscopic dislocations , i.e.  defects in the crystal structure of the material , see  @xcite for some recent works in this direction . these are volume - preserving and so one often postulates * plastic incompressibility * @xmath103 in this case , @xmath104 .    even the assumption of plastic incompressibility , however , still does not alleviate the so - called `` uniqueness problem '' : the krner ",
    "lee decomposition @xmath105 is far from unique except in very simple cases .",
    "we adopt the usual approach to treat @xmath6 as an internal variable and @xmath106 as a derived quantity .",
    "we denote the lie algebra associated with the lie group @xmath107 by @xmath108 .",
    "intuitively , elements of @xmath109 represent `` infinitesimal '' referential plastic distortion , or , more precisely , * referential plastic rates * , i.e.  the speed by which a quantity changes .",
    "formally , @xmath108 can be defined as the tangent ( vector ) space to @xmath107 at the identity matrix , @xmath110 .",
    "the fact that we consider the tangent space at the identity reflects the referential character of elements in @xmath109 .",
    "the following are some relevant lie groups and lie algebras :    * the lie group @xmath111 , which has the lie algebra @xmath112 , is the standard choice . *",
    "if we choose @xmath113 and @xmath114 , then only orthogonal transformations are allowed , plastic shears are forbidden . * a single slip system with slip direction @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and slip plane normal @xmath16 , @xmath17 such that @xmath23 can be modeled using @xmath115 and @xmath116 .    motivated by the microscopic discussion about the plastic distortion equation ,",
    "see  , we define the * ( referential ) plastic drift * @xmath117 ( see below for the fact that @xmath118 ) as @xmath119 to translate a spatial plastic distortion rate @xmath120 relative to the ( plastically ) deformed configuration to the referential frame , we need to pull it back to @xmath121 .",
    "this is accomplished via a pre - multiplication of @xmath122 with @xmath123 , yielding the referential plastic drift @xmath124 .",
    "thus , @xmath124 takes the role of @xmath52 in  .",
    "more abstractly , the elements of @xmath125 can also be considered to be the left - invariant vector fields @xmath126 on @xmath107 , that is @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the left multiplication and @xmath129 its pushforward .",
    "then we can express the pullback to the referential frame through @xmath130 .",
    "thus , the * referential time derivative * @xmath131 acts on a curve @xmath132 as @xmath133 note that taking the referential time derivative is not a linear operation , but it obeys the usual chain rule under reparametrizations .",
    "the cotangent space @xmath134 to @xmath107 at @xmath6 contains * stresses * ( forces per unit area ) , cf .",
    "an element @xmath135 can be pulled back to the cotangent space @xmath136 at the identity , where @xmath137 is the dual space to the lie algebra @xmath109 ( which is a lie co - algebra , but we do not need this ) .",
    "this is accomplished via the map @xmath138 , which can be checked by observing that @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the _ frobenius product _ of the matrices @xmath141 , which here acts as the duality pairing between @xmath109 and @xmath137 .",
    "the elements of @xmath137 therefore are * referential stresses*.    furthermore , we assume that the material body possesses * internal variables * @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the canonical vector lie group describing the internal variables of the system ( for example , dislocation density in metals ) with associated _ abelian _ ( i.e.  trivial ) lie algebra @xmath144 .",
    "general lie groups @xmath145 are also possible , but a simple vector will suffice for us here .",
    "according to  , in this commutative lie group we have for a curve @xmath146 that @xmath147 since left `` multiplication '' is simply addition and hence @xmath148 .",
    "we bundle together the plastic distortion and internal variables ( at a point ) and define the * ( local ) full internal state space * as the product lie group @xmath149 which has lie algebra @xmath150 , where @xmath108 and @xmath151 . in this way we consider the plastic distortion to be part of the internal state of the material , using the notation @xmath152",
    "in this section , we describe the energetics and basic dynamics of the two _ fundamental motions _ that we consider in our modelling approach : _ elastic minimization _ , for which @xmath153 , and _ elasto - plastic relaxation _ , for which @xmath154 .",
    "the next section will combine these basic motions into a full dynamic model , keeping in mind the relative speed by which these two motions progress .",
    "the energetics of the material are governed by the * free energy functional * @xmath155 : = \\int_\\omega w(x,\\nabla y(t , x),p(t , x),z(t , x ) ) { \\;\\mathrm{d}}x,\\ ] ] where @xmath156 is the * energy density * ( recall @xmath157 ) , which associates to each local state an energy per referential unit volume .",
    "we further split @xmath158 as @xmath159 here , @xmath160 is the * elastic energy density * and @xmath161 is the * hardening energy density*.    we assume @xmath162 to be as smooth as necessary and @xmath163 to satisfy the * objectivity ( frame - indifference ) * @xmath164 often , @xmath162 also satisfy certain material symmetries , such as @xmath165 for all @xmath166 from a * symmetry group * @xmath167 .",
    "the most common such material symmetry is * isotropy * , for which @xmath168 , the group of orthogonal @xmath53-matrices with positive determinant , see section  3.4 in  @xcite ; a recent study of the isotropic case is in  @xcite .    as already mentioned before , if @xmath3 , no complete elastic unloading is possible , as @xmath169 would then contradict @xmath170 .",

    "the convexity tells us that this oscillatory path expends more energy , as should intuitively be the case for `` reasonable '' materials .",

    "the lower semicontinuity is a minimal continuity assumption and can again be justified on physical grounds or out of mathematical necessity .",

    "however , one may extend the theory to incorporate this constraint as well , but chose not to do this here for the sake of notational clarity .",
    "the reason we specify the ( primal / dual ) flow rule in terms of the drift @xmath285 and not in terms of the current flow velocity @xmath286 is that when the material flows , the flow rule needs to `` flow with the material '' , and therefore @xmath265 ought to be a _",

    "so far , we have not specified anything about the dependence of @xmath260 on @xmath265 beyond convexity and lower semicontinuity and in fact we will later use several dissipation potentials .    according to the coleman ",
    "noll procedure  @xcite , thermodynamic reasoning should give _ constitutive restrictions_. in this spirit , combining   with the flow rule   yields the * positivity * condition on the dissipation potential @xmath260 and its dual @xmath289 : @xmath291 where the product `` @xmath270 '' is understood to act on every stress in @xmath267 individually .",
    "this is a weaker version of the strict positivity we required above .",
    "furthermore , it is elementary to see that for a convex function @xmath292 $ ] with @xmath293 it always holds that @xmath294 , hence the above condition   is automatically satisfied for convex @xmath260 , giving another reason to require convexity as a structural property .",

    "it is a fundamental property of elasto - plastic processes that if the generalized stress @xmath298 lies in the interior of an * elastic stability domain * @xmath299 , then no plastic flow takes place .",
    "the thinking here is that below the stress threshold @xmath300 , which is called the * yield surface * , no plastic slip can be activated .",

    "we here diverge from this usual modeling and allow @xmath298 to be outside @xmath302 , at least for a very short time .",
    "this occurs if the elastic minimization selects a state @xmath191 with @xmath308 .",
    "this state , however , is _ transient _ in the sense that the material will try to correct the situation by following an elasto - plastic relaxation path , which at the terminal point will restore @xmath309 .",
    "as we allow this relaxation to occur with infinite speed relative to the global ( slow ) time , this relaxation action _ is not visible _ on the slow ( global ) timescale .",
    "however , if the system jumps to a far away state , then , on a `` fast '' time scale , the relaxation path is not contracted and should form part of the solution concept of our model .",

    "the material can not decrease its elastic energy , say @xmath313 , through an elasto - plastic relaxation flow , since a rate in @xmath234 can not change the determinant of @xmath4 .",

    "we can always transform between referential and structural vectors by applying @xmath6 , which gives the structural vector @xmath345 corresponding to a referential vector @xmath43 , and the corresponding inverse transformation . in mathematical terms , we need to decide whether we should formulate the flow rule and all other plastic quantities with respect to the reference frame or with respect to the structural frame , where the latter appears to be more popular  @xcite .",
    "all quantities have versions in both frames .",
    "indeed , in the structural frame , the plastic rate is measured via the * structural plastic distortion rate * @xmath346 which is a tensor that maps structural vectors to structural vectors since @xmath6 maps material vectors to structural vectors .",
    "the `` structural stress '' is the * mandel stress * @xmath347 it is easy to see that @xmath68 and @xmath348 are again conjugate in the sense that @xmath349 is equal to the dissipation @xmath350 , in complete analogy to the fact that @xmath243 and @xmath52 are conjugate .",
    "furthermore , it turns out that the referential and the structural flow rule are equivalent if @xmath260 is allowed to depend on @xmath6 .",
    "indeed , a computation shows that   is equivalent to @xmath351 where @xmath352    considering the abstract algebraic structure , the transition from referential to structural space is accomplished via _ conjugation _ : define the * adjoint mapping * @xmath353 and the * dual adjoint mapping * @xmath354 through @xmath355 then , @xmath356 since @xmath357 and @xmath358 are isomorphisms , the formulations are indeed completely interchangeable . in the isotropic case , also @xmath359 , see  @xcite .",
    "we remark that while the referential and the structural formulation are in principle equivalent , there may be good reasons to choose one over the other , at least in the non - isotropic case .",
    "it is quite possible that one of the @xmath360 is independent of @xmath6 , whereas the other is not .",
    "in fact , if the anisotropy originates in the crystal lattice ( for example different behavior along the crystal vectors in crystal plasticity ) , then the structural @xmath361 has a good chance of being independent of @xmath6 ( and hence `` simpler '' ) . in this case",
    ", the whole model should be formulated in the structural frame , which is an easy translation . on the other hand ,",
    "if the anisotropy is due to mesoscale laminations , then @xmath260 may be independent of @xmath6 .    in the absence of the reasons",
    "just alluded to , we however believe that there is at least an `` aesthetic '' reason to prefer formulating the model in the reference frame : since @xmath6 is in general not a gradient , there are no `` structural points '' , only material points .",
    "the engineering literature sometimes considers points @xmath362 in an imaginary `` structural space '' , but this is not a rigorous notion .",
    "moreover , if we do not require the plastic incompressibility @xmath363 ( soils , for example , are plastically compressible ) , which in any case should be treated as just a _ constitutive _ assumption , then the mandel stress should reflect this and we really ought to use @xmath364 in other words , the points @xmath362 from the structural space are just points in @xmath81 , but the _ structural manifold _ @xmath81 is now equipped with a different metric .",
    "all of this seems rather cumbersome and in light of the equivalence exposed above and also the microscopic motivation of plastic flow in  , we prefer to work in the referential frame .",
    "in reality , plastic flow is _ rate - dependent _ ( viscous ) , but only slightly so below absolute temperatures of approximately @xmath365 , where @xmath366 is the melting temperature of the material , see  section  78 in  @xcite .",
    "for instance , in a commonly - used power viscosity law ( see section  5.4 in  @xcite ) the stress depends on the rate with exponent @xmath367 , that is , @xmath368 .",
    "for example , steel with 35% carbon at 450 c has @xmath369 and the titanium - aluminium alloy ta6v at 350 c has @xmath370 ; more values can be found in table  6.2 of  @xcite .",
    "the movement of the system is directed in such a way as to move the stress @xmath298 toward @xmath300 , where the movement stops as the internal friction stress threshold is no longer exceeded .",
    "it can be seen that the larger @xmath371 is , the faster this `` relaxation '' takes place . indeed , from the dual flow rule   we have @xmath372 .",
    "for @xmath11 , we approach `` infinitely fast '' relaxation .",
    "on `` slow '' time scales we should therefore see near - infinitely fast relaxation , i.e.  @xmath309 always , this is called * ( local ) stability*. in order to make this precise we will consider a time _ rescaling _ and pass to the limit ( this is equivalent to letting @xmath11 ) .",
    "then , for the resulting global evolution , we obtain a rate-_independent _ evolution , at least where the solution process is continuous .",
    "this means that the system does not have any dynamics of its own and is purely driven by external forces .    however , it turns out that realistic concepts of solutions to rate - independent systems  @xcite must allow the system to _ jump _ from one state to another instantaneously ( with respect to the slow global time scale ) .",
    "a key question , which is also central in other recent works  @xcite , is whether during a jump at `` infinite '' speed the modeling assumption of rate - independence can be upheld .",
    "most materials in fact display rate-_dependent _ behavior under fast deformations and this should be reflected in the modeling .    in a way opposite to the usual approach of starting with a rate - independent flow rule and then additionally specifying what happens during fast jumps , our strategy conversely starts with a rate-_dependent _ flow rule and rescales time",
    "so that the slow ( global ) evolution becomes rate-_independent _ wherever it is continuous , but during fast jumps the flow can be rate - dependent , rate - independent or a mixture of both .",
    "thus , our model has _ two _ time parameters and hence we call our solutions * two - speed solutions*. consequently , we posit the following key assumption :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the basic flow rule is rate - dependent , i.e.  the fundamental dissipation potential @xmath260 is super - linear in the rate . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    in order to arrive at a full evolutionary model , we consider the evolution to be partitioned into segments of equal duration and describe the dynamics as we step from one time point to the next . here",
    ", we use the two fundamental motions ( purely elastic minimization and elasto - plastic relaxation ) described in the previous section . in order to combine them , we make the following fundamental assumption :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ elastic deformations are much faster than plastic flow .",
    "equivalently , there is infinitesimal plastic inertia . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    this is verified quite well experimentally , see for example  @xcite and is also theoretically consistent ( at least for metals ) since the flow of dislocations is constricted to be always slower than the propagation of elastic deformation through shear waves ( s - waves ) .",
    "this is so because the plastic drag tends to infinity as the plastic distortion rate approaches the shear wave speed , see  @xcite .",
    "our time - stepping scheme then progresses by alternating between the following two stages :    a.   * elastic minimization : * when the material is moved out of elastic equilibrium , it first deforms in a purely elastic fashion , where the elastic distortion jumps ( instantaneously ) to a minimizer of the elastic energy , completely ignoring any plastic flow effects .",
    "consequently , there may be an * elastic excess * , where the stress is outside the * elastic stability domain * , i.e.  the constitutively specified stress region where the system can not plastically flow ( see below ) .",
    "we will use the _ principle of virtual power _ ( or , alternatively , a balance of forces ) under the assumptions @xmath175 , @xmath176 to derive the elastic force balance .",
    "b.   * elasto - plastic relaxation : * to correct the elastic excess if it exists , the material then _ relaxes _ through an elasto - plastic flow , which is purely internal in the sense that the observable macroscopic shape of the body remains the same , i.e. , @xmath205 .",
    "again via the _ principle of virtual power _",
    "we derive the elasto - plastic power balance and then the flow rule .",
    "the flow stops once the stress has reached the elastic stability domain .",
    "this splitting of the motion into the above two basic modes is the defining feature of the present model and we consider it to be physically realistic ( it is also somewhat reminiscent of predictor  corrector schemes in numerics ) .",
    "another benefit is that it allows for a clean modeling . in this context notice that the elastic minimality from stage  i will potentially be destroyed by the relaxation in stage  ii , and the condition that the stress is contained in the elastic stability domain",
    "might no longer hold true after a successive stage  i ( even if the external loading does not change ) .",
    "therefore , we really should iterate these stages until we have reached a _ fixed point_. this , however , turns out not to be necessary , since we will perform both stages for each time step in a time - stepping problem and letting the time step size go to zero will have the same effect .      as outlined above ,",
    "let @xmath258 $ ] be a given * rate - dependent dissipation ( pseudo)potential * that we assume to be convex , lower semicontinuous , and * superlinear * , that is @xmath373 furthermore , for @xmath374 , we want to assume that @xmath375 is _ continuously differentiable _ in @xmath376 , expressing the fact that we model a _",
    "system , i.e.  that the flow direction and speed are uniquely determined .",
    "then , also @xmath377 is continuously differentiable for all @xmath378 such that @xmath379 for some @xmath374 , see  @xcite .",
    "note that additionally @xmath260 could depend on the current state @xmath380 , but we suppress this dependency for ease of notation .    as long as @xmath381 , plastic flow is governed by our flow rule @xmath382 see  , . additionally , we want to express the notion that the flow stops once we have reached the elastic stability domain @xmath302 .",
    "thus , we really use the * combined flow rule * @xmath383    clearly , we only need the dual flow potential @xmath384 for @xmath381 since the flow stops once we have reached the yield surface @xmath300 . therefore ,",
    "we now change notation slightly and from here onwards denote by @xmath385 the * _ combined _ dissipation potential * , for which we furthermore require the decomposition @xmath386 into the following two components :    a.   @xmath387 is the * rate - independent dissipation potential * , which is equal to the support function of @xmath302 , @xmath388 i.e.  the dual of the characteristic function @xmath389 of @xmath302 ( which is @xmath322 on @xmath302 and @xmath390 otherwise ) .",
    "b.   @xmath391 is the convex , differentiable * residual dissipation potential*. we also assume that its dual @xmath392 is strictly positive , that is @xmath393 and @xmath394 for @xmath395 ( this is essentially a superlinearity assumption on @xmath396 and for instance satisfied if @xmath397 ) .",

    "then , we can define @xmath289 ( and hence by duality @xmath260 ) through   and we obtain for @xmath260 that @xmath405^ *      = \\bigl[\\chi_{{\\mathcal{s } } } \\operatorname{\\square}r_+^*\\bigr]^ *      = r_1 + r_+\\ ] ] where we have set @xmath406 and @xmath407^*$ ] .",
    "thus , the decomposition above holds , where we also note that @xmath408 because of @xmath403 and @xmath409 because of @xmath393 .",
    "an important special case , which we discuss for further illustration , is a material that is * associative*. while there is considerable disagreement in the literature over what exactly constitutes an associative flow rule , we here understand it to mean that there exists a proper , lower semicontinuous , convex , and strictly increasing @xmath410 and a norm @xmath411 on @xmath240 such that @xmath412 the utility of these assumptions is that they allow to simplify the definition ( cf .  ) of the dual combined dissipation potential @xmath413 to @xmath414 where @xmath415 is the * distance function * with respect to the norm @xmath411 . in this case , all flow rates are normal to the elastic stability domain , that is , @xmath416 where @xmath417 denotes the normal cone to @xmath302 at @xmath418 , i.e.@xmath419 this is related to the _ maximum plastic work principle _ , which is a strengthening of the second law of thermodynamics , see p.  5759 in  @xcite .",
    "a common choice for a rate - dependent dissipation potential @xmath420 ( recall that @xmath421 contains all trace - free @xmath53-matrices ) , is a mises power law , see for instance section  101 in  @xcite , that is , the restriction of @xmath422 to the complement of the elastic stability domain @xmath423 here , @xmath424 and @xmath425 .",

    "we define @xmath436 through @xmath438 note that @xmath439 , where @xmath440 .    assuming that this path exists and is unique , we denote its endpoint by @xmath441 . if we also set @xmath442 if already @xmath443 , then @xmath444 can be considered a function @xmath445 with the property that @xmath446      conceptually , rate - independence is of course not a physical property of a system , but a _ mathematical _ rescaling limit",
    "so , consider an elasto - plastic process @xmath447 with external loading @xmath448 , where @xmath449 .",
    "then , the basic assumption in this work is that the system evolves according to a ( fast ) flow rule as defined above .",
    "however , as discussed before , if @xmath450 were to be held constant at some point in time , the system would settle very quickly into a rest state until the external loading changes and the system is pushed out of equilibrium .",
    "the traditional rate - independent modeling is built upon the assumption that only this global movement is interesting and the fast `` relaxation '' movements towards a rest state can be neglected , at least if the system does not jump to a far - away state in an instant .",
    "this idealized situation is mathematically expressed through _ rescaling _ : define for small @xmath451 the process @xmath452 as a solution of the fast dynamics for the slower external loading @xmath453 , where now @xmath454 $ ] .",
    "it is , however , inconvenient to deal with changing time intervals and so we reparametrize the whole process by setting @xmath455 , @xmath449 .",
    "this has the effect of keeping the external loading at constant speed , but accelerating the response dynamics of the system by the factor @xmath456 .",
    "letting @xmath457 , we call the limit process @xmath458 the * rate - independent limit*. it models the situation where the relaxation behavior of the system is infinitely fast and the system remains completely stationary if the external loading does not change . however , this acceleration is only due to a rescaling of time , which does not affect the dissipative energetics .",
    "so , effectively , this new system has a different ( rescaled ) dissipation law to reflect the rescaling in time .",
    "more concretely , the `` fast '' relaxation paths @xmath459 ( corresponding to the @xmath436 s from the previous section ) for @xmath460 have to modified to read @xmath461 in the following we will develop an approximative , time - stepping , scheme whose solution reflects this sped - up response .    for reasons of consistency , we assume that the initial values @xmath462 where the diffeomorphism @xmath463 and @xmath464 constitute a rest state , i.e.@xmath465    \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad    \\sigma(u_{\\mathrm{start } } ) \\in { \\mathcal{s}}.\\ ] ] here , recall the definition of @xmath466 from  . this condition is imposed to ensure that the system does not immediately jump and we should have chosen the endpoint of the jump as initial value .",
    "let @xmath467 and divide the time interval @xmath74 into an equidistant partition @xmath468 we also need the * rescaling coefficient * @xmath469 , which describes the time - rescaling .",
    "we require that that @xmath470 as @xmath11 `` more slowly '' than the partition , that is , @xmath471 this constraint expresses that the elastic minimization is relatively faster than the elasto - plastic relaxation .",
    "the * time - stepping evolution * @xmath472 consists of the component functions @xmath473 , @xmath474 , @xmath475 . in every consecutive time period @xmath7 the discrete system in turn executes the following two _ stages _ ( illustrated in figure  [ fig : twostage ] ) :        a.   * elastic minimization : * first , we let the system deform elastically _ as if there was no plastic flow rule present_. let the diffeomorphism @xmath476 be such that ( holding @xmath477 fixed ) @xmath478\\ ] ] over all diffeomorphisms @xmath479 that also satisfy the prescribed boundary conditions .",
    "we assume that the system s total deformation jumps immediately to @xmath480 : @xmath481 b.   * elasto - plastic relaxation : * whenever necessary , the system will now exchange elastic for plastic distortion to restore the requirement that the generalized stress lies within the elastic stability domain .",
    "we define the internal state at a fixed @xmath79 as @xmath482 then , for the evolution of @xmath483 we consider two cases , depending on the value of @xmath484 : a.   if @xmath485 , then set ( no flow ) @xmath486 b.   otherwise , the system needs to relax through elasto - plastic flow , for which it employs a relaxation path @xmath436 as in section  [ sc : paths ] with @xmath487 ( for our fixed @xmath72 ) .",
