    "through the observations of pulsars , it is known that neutron stars generally have magnetic fields , whose typical strength is thought to be around @xmath1 gauss , assuming that their spin periods would decay by the dipole radiations @xcite . additionally , the existence of the strongly magnetized neutron stars , the so - called magnetars @xcite , is observationally suggested .",
    "magnetars may sometimes be considered as a different family from the usual neutron stars .",
    "the magnetic field strength of magnetars becomes around @xmath2 gauss .",
    "unfortunately , the mechanism for how such a strong magnetic field is produced is still unknown .",
    "the magnetic fields outside neutron stars , including magnetars , can be dominated by dipole fields , but the magnetic distribution inside the star is also still unknown .",
    "the magnetic fields inside the star may eventually settle into dipole fields , but the magnetic configuration must be quite complicated at least just after the formation of neutron stars via supernova or merger of neutron stars .",
    "under such a situation , where the magnetic fields are completely tangled inside the stars , the spectra of oscillations could be different from those expected in the cold neutron stars with quiet magnetic fields .",
    "the observations of the spectra of stellar oscillations give us a good chance to extract the interior information of the neutron stars .",
    "like seismology of the earth and helioseismology of the sun , asteroseismology of neutron stars is a valuable technique to obtain the interior information via the oscillation spectra , which could tell us the equation of state ( eos ) , stellar average density , stellar compactness , and so on @xcite .",
    "furthermore , via oscillation spectra from neutron stars , it might be possible to probe the gravitational theory itself in a strong gravitational field @xcite .",
    "the gravitational waves emitted from neutron stars are probably the most suitable candidates to adopt asteroseismology due to their strong penetration capability , although unfortunately they can not be detected yet . on the other hand ,",
    "observational evidences of the oscillations of neutron stars already exists : the quasiperiodic oscillations radiated from soft - gamma repeaters .",
    "quasiperiodic oscillations are discovered in the afterglow of the giant flares observed in the soft - gamma repeaters @xcite .",
    "since the soft - gamma repeaters are one of the candidates of magnetars , the discovered quasiperiodic oscillations are considered to be strongly associated with the oscillations of neutron stars . in order to theoretically explain the frequencies of quasiperiodic oscillations ,",
    "many attempts have been made in terms of the crustal torsional oscillations and/or magnetic oscillations @xcite . from the point of view of asteroseismology , the possibilities for constraining the crust eos using the observed frequencies have also been suggested @xcite . meanwhile , through such attempts , the features of the magnetar oscillations have become increasingly understood .",
    "that is , the magnetic oscillations without the crust elasticity become continuum spectra , assuming a dipole magnetic field @xcite , because the propagating time along the field lines inside the star is not a specific but a continuous quantity . additionally , the excited oscillations inside the star with crust elasticity depend strongly on the strength of magnetic fields .",
    "the magnetic oscillations are only excited if the magnetic fields are strong enough , while the oscillations in the vicinity of the stellar surface become the crustal torsional oscillations if the magnetic fields are weak enough @xcite . in any case",
    ", the spectra of excited magnetic oscillations should depend on the magnetic configuration inside the star @xcite .",
    "namely , since the magnetic fields just after the birth of a neutron star could be highly tangled , the spectra of the stellar oscillations might be different from those of the  clean \" magnetic configuration .",
    "so far there have been very few examinations of the spectra analysis for the stellar models with highly tangled magnetic fields . at most ,",
    "the stellar oscillations have been examined in simple toy models with constant density @xcite , where they consider the oscillations under the assumption of the uniform magnetic fields together with the tangled fields . in such studies ,",
    "the authors point out the possibility that the existence of magnetic fields could modify the shear modulus inside the star , i.e. , the introduction of an effective shear modulus . in this paper , deriving the perturbation equations in the realistic neutron star models , we focus especially on the highly tangled magnetic fields so that the global magnetic structure is negligible as an extreme case , and we systematically examine the magnetic oscillations in such stellar models .",
    "we remark that , since the actual field in magnetar interiors may have the global and tangled components , the limiting case of a purely tangled field considered in this paper may still be far from a realistic configuration , at least for expressing the cold neutron stars . in this examination , we consider the magnetic oscillations with and without crust elasticity .",
    "this is because the crust region does not form just after the production of neutron stars , and it could take time to appear @xcite .",
    "we adopt geometric units , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the speed of light and the gravitational constant , respectively , and the metric signature is @xmath6 in this paper .",
    "in general , the magnetized neutron stars are deformed due to nonspherical magnetic pressure .",
    "however , the magnetic energy ( @xmath7 ) is much smaller than the gravitational binding energy ( @xmath8 ) even for the magnetars , where @xmath9 .",
    "thus , in this paper we neglect the deformation due to the existence of magnetic fields .",
    "additionally , the stellar deformation may become significant only when the neutron star rotates very fast . in this paper , for simplicity , we also neglect the rotational effect , which leads to the consequence that the stellar configuration becomes spherically symmetric .",
    "the metric describing the spherically symmetric neutron stars is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the metric functions depending only on the radial coordinate @xmath13 .",
    "in particular , @xmath12 is associated with the mass function @xmath14 as @xmath15 .",
    "we remark that , from the metric form , the four - velocity of the equilibrium stellar model is written as @xmath16 .",
    "the stellar models are constructed by integrating the well - known tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations together with the eos of neutron star matter . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the eos based on the skyrme - type effective interaction , the so - called sly4 , which was derived by douchin and haensel @xcite .",
    "the density at the crust basis predicted from this eos is @xmath17 g/@xmath18 , while the maximum mass of the neutron star becomes @xmath19 , where the stellar radius is @xmath20 km . in fig .",
    "[ fig : m - rdr ] , we plot the stellar radius , @xmath21 , and the crust thickness , @xmath22 , as a function of the stellar mass . in the same figure",
    ", we also plot the ratio of the core radius , i.e. , @xmath23 , to the stellar radius with the dotted line . from this figure",
    ", one can see that the curst thickness is only less than 10 % of the stellar radius for the neutron stars with a mass greater than @xmath24 .",
    ", and the crust thickness , @xmath22 , as a function of the stellar mass constructed with the sly4 eos .",
    "in addition , the ratio of the core radius to the stellar radius , @xmath25 , is also plotted with the dotted line . ]    on such an equilibrium configuration , we consider the axisymmetric axial perturbations , adopting the relativistic cowling approximation .",
    "that is , we neglect the metric perturbations during the stellar oscillations . since the axial perturbations do not involve the density variation , one can expect to determine the frequencies of the stellar oscillations with reasonable accuracy even for the relativistic cowling approximation .",
    "the nonzero component of perturbed matter quantity in the axial perturbation is only @xmath26 , which is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 ; @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the partial derivative with respect to @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively ; @xmath33 denotes the radial dependence of the angular displacement of matter element ; and @xmath34 is the legendre polynomial of order @xmath0 .    the matter perturbations are described by the linearized equation of motion , i.e. , eq .",
    "( 35 ) in @xcite , while the perturbations of magnetic fields are subject to the linearized induction equation ( 37 ) in @xcite .",
    "we remark that , assuming the ideal magnetohydrodynamics , the perturbations of magnetic fields can be written by the variable of matter perturbations together with the background quantities , as in eq .",
    "( 37 ) in @xcite .",
    "then , for a general magnetic distribution @xmath35 , the perturbation equation to determine the axisymmetric axial perturbation for the magnetized neutron stars becomes eq .",
    "( 51 ) in @xcite , where @xmath36 is a normalized magnetic field given by @xmath37 and the all perturbation variables are assumed to have a harmonic time dependence such as @xmath38 .",
    "now , we consider the decomposition of the magnetic fields @xmath39 as @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote the components of the global configuration and the intricately tangled structure of the magnetic fields inside the neutron stars , respectively . here",
    ", we assume that the typical length scale of the tangled magnetic fields would be @xmath43 .",
    "that is , the small scale structure of the tangled magnetic fields should be taken into account , only if one focuses on the phenomena with a length scale smaller than @xmath43 .",
    "otherwise , it is not necessary to care about the exact structure of the tangled magnetic fields , where only the strength of magnetic fields averaged in the volume @xmath44 is a relevant quantity .",
    "moreover , in order to examine the effects of the highly tangled magnetic fields on the stellar oscillations , we consider the situation that @xmath45 in this paper ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath46 . these situations might be possible when the neutron star would be formed just after the supernovae or the merger of two neutron stars .",
    "hereafter , we focus only on the phenomena with a length scale larger than @xmath43 , and we simply express @xmath42 as @xmath39 .",
    "with respect to the highly tangled magnetic fields in the length scale larger than @xmath43 , it is natural to assume that @xmath47 does not have any correlations with @xmath48 , @xmath49 for @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , and also that @xmath51 does not have any correlations with @xmath52 for @xmath50 .",
    "thus , in eq .",

    "( [ eq : perturbation0 ] ) is removed , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : correlation ] ) .",
    "then , by setting that @xmath57 for considering the oscillations whose wavelength is greater than @xmath43 , and assuming that the background magnetic field would be axisymmetric for simplicity , the linearized equation ( [ eq : perturbation0 ] ) becomes @xmath58 \\omega^2 e^{-2\\phi } { \\cal y }      + & \\left[\\mu + \\frac{{\\cal h}^2}{3 } \\right ] e^{-2\\lambda}{\\cal y } ''       + \\left[\\left(\\frac{4}{r } + \\phi ' - \\lambda ' \\right)\\mu + \\mu ' + \\left(\\phi ' + \\frac{2}{r}\\right)\\frac{{\\cal h}^2}{3}\\right]e^{-2\\lambda}{\\cal y } '   \\nonumber \\\\      & - \\frac{(\\ell+2)(\\ell-1)}{r^2}\\left[\\mu + \\frac{{\\cal h}^2}{3}\\right]{\\cal y } , \\label{eq : perturbation1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the local magnetic field strength defined by @xmath60 .",

    "( [ eq : perturbation1 ] ) , one has to prepare the strength distribution of @xmath59 , which is still unknown .",

    "the remaining parameters , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , determine the magnetic structure inside the star .",

    "first , we consider the stellar oscillations without the effect of crust elasticity by setting @xmath86 . the newly born neutron star , just after the supernova explosion or the merger of binary neutron stars , may not have a crust region , because the temperature is too high to form the crystallization of crust . in this case ,",
    "the restoring force of the torsional oscillations inside the neutron stars is only the magnetic tension , which excites the magnetic oscillations .",

[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     moreover , in order to see how the frequencies of magnetic oscillations could be shifted for the different stellar models , we focus on the relative deviation of the frequencies from those for the stellar model with @xmath88 .",
    "so , the relative deviation is evaluated by @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 denote the frequencies of the @xmath0th magnetic oscillations with the number of the radial nodes , @xmath66 , for the neutron star models with @xmath88 and with the stellar mass , @xmath103 , respectively .",

    "in this paper , we systematically examine the frequencies of the magnetic oscillations in neutron stars with highly tangled magnetic fields , focusing on the axial type oscillations . for this purpose",
    ", we derive the perturbation equations describing such oscillations by combining the linearized equation of motion and induction equation . to derive this perturbation equation , we assume that the strength of the global magnetic structure is much smaller than the tangled field strength , and that the magnetic fields are tangled with a length scale smaller than the wavelength of the magnetic oscillations considered in this paper .",
    "then , we calculate the frequencies of magnetic oscillations with and without crust elasticity , adopting the phenomenological strength distribution of magnetic fields .",
    "we confirm that the frequencies of magnetic oscillations without crust elasticity are exactly proportional to the field strength , as expected .",
    "the frequencies decrease as the stellar mass increases , which also depend on the strength distribution of magnetic fields .",
    "on the other hand , the spectra of the magnetic oscillations with crust elasticity become more complicated , where we could not observe the pure crustal torsional oscillations even for the weak magnetic fields . for discussing the spectra",

    "in fact , we find that , independently of the stellar mass , the frequencies are almost proportional to the strength of magnetic fields except for the range from @xmath138 up to @xmath139 .",
    "the effect of the crust elasticity can be seen more strongly in the fundamental oscillations with lower harmonics index @xmath0 .",
    "additionally , we show that the fundamental oscillations are less dependent on the stellar mass for the weak magnetic fields , while the overtones are more sensitive to the stellar mass not only in the weak but also the strong field regimes .",
    "furthermore , we find that the spectra of the magnetic oscillations in the neutron stars with highly tangled magnetic fields are discrete .",
    "this is completely a different spectrum property from the case for the stellar model with pure dipole magnetic fields , which leads to the continuum spectra .    in this paper",
    ", we do not take into account the contributions from the global magnetic structure , which should play an important role for considering the cold neutron stars .",

    "<S> the oscillation spectra with crust elasticity become more complicated , where the frequencies even for weak magnetic fields are different from the crustal torsional oscillations without magnetic fields . for discussing spectra </S>",
    "<S> , the critical field strength can play an important role , and it is determined in such a way that the shear velocity is equivalent to the alfvn velocity at the crust basis . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we find that the effect of the crust elasticity can be seen strongly in the fundamental oscillations with a lower harmonic index , @xmath0 . unlike the stellar models with a pure dipole magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> , we also find that the spectra with highly tangled magnetic fields become discrete , where one can expect many of the eigenfrequencies . </S>",
    "<S> maybe these frequencies could be detected after the violent phenomena breaking the global magnetic field structure . </S>"
