    "is omitted and the reader is instead referred to a collection of reviews available on the subject  @xcite .",
    "we start with a description of the crystal structure and general properties of @xmath0  and other closely related compounds and then present the recently obtained experimental results on their low - temperature magnetic properties by our group and others .",
    "particular attention is paid to the zero - field ground state of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4  ( section  [ section_zero_field ] ) , as well as the field - induced behaviour of these compounds ( section  [ section_field ] ) . the penultimate section briefly reviews the other @xmath0  compounds and discusses the importance of crystal field effects .",
    "the concluding section compares different members of the family and includes a brief summary .     positions of the magnetic rare - earth @xmath5 ions within the @xmath0  compounds , with the two crystallographically inequivalent @xmath5 sites shown in different colours .",
    "the left - hand panel emphasises the honeycomb arrangement of the @xmath5 ions when viewed along the @xmath6 axis , while the right - hand panel demonstrates the formation of zigzag ladders running along the @xmath6 axis which link the honeycomb layers and give rise to geometric frustration .",
    "the blue box represents a crystal unit cell of the @xmath7 space group . ]    the members of the @xmath0  family crystallise in the form of calcium ferrite  @xcite , with the space group @xmath7 ; the crystal structure of these materials ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1_structure ] ) can be viewed as a network of linked hexagons and triangles  @xcite .",
    "the most important feature of the linked hexagon ( or  _ honeycomb _ \" ) lattice is that it has the lowest coordination number , 3 , in two dimensions .",
    "this feature attracts a lot of theoretical attention to the lattice , but being bipartite , the honeycomb lattice is not frustrated if only the nearest - neighbour interactions are considered .",
    "the frustration in a honeycomb lattice can be induced by further neighbour interaction and numerous models of frustrated honeycomb lattices which include heisenberg , @xmath8 or ising @xmath9 interactions have been extensively studied theoretically , particularly for the @xmath10 quantum case .    in the @xmath0  family , however , the cause of frustration is different ; it arises from the triangular ( or  zigzag \" ) ladders running along the @xmath6 axis which link the honeycomb layers . in this respect",
    "@xmath0  compounds are similar to recently reported @xmath11  @xcite and perhaps to @xmath12 compounds  @xcite . the term  zigzag \" has also been used to describe the spin - chain structure of another honeycomb lattice compound @xmath13  @xcite , but in a different context - to describe the arrangement of magnetic moments formed there .",
    "the orthorhombic unit cell of the @xmath0  compounds contains 4 sr atoms on a single site , 8 @xmath14 atoms ( split equally between two sites ) and 16 oxygen atoms occupying 4 sites ; all sites are of the @xmath15 type with the coordinates @xmath16  @xcite",
    ". the @xmath17 and @xmath18 axes of the unit cell are typically quite long , about 10 and 12    respectively , while the @xmath6 axis is the shortest , at around 3.4    on average . the magnetic @xmath14 atoms are surrounded by the distorted oxygen octahedra , forming the chains running along the @xmath6-axis .",
    "the shortest @xmath19 separation is along the chains ; there is a slightly larger separation between the chains formed by the @xmath14 atoms occupying the same sites ( which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1_structure ] in the same colour ) , while the distance between @xmath14 atoms from different sites ( red and green in fig .",
    "[ fig1_structure ] ) is much greater  @xcite .",
    "such a crystal structure predetermines the quasi one - dimensional magnetic properties of the @xmath0  compounds , as for rare - earth ions in insulating materials direct exchange is often the most important mechanism for magnetic coupling .",
    "it is rather useful to note the equivalence of the well - studied linear chain model with nearest and next - nearest interactions  @xcite and the ladders of rare - earth ions described here if these were `` stretched '' along the @xmath6 axis .",
    "an important observation to make prior to the description of their properties is that both polycrystalline and single crystal samples of the @xmath0  compounds have been used for investigations .",
    "the progress achieved to date in the understanding of their complex behaviour is , however , largely due to the availability of high quality single crystals .",
    "crystals of magnetic @xmath0  oxides and their non - magnetic analogues ( with @xmath1 lu or y ) have been synthesised by the floating zone technique by our group and others  @xcite .",

    "the presence of another magnetic component was also observed as a pronounced scattering around the @xmath33 positions .",
    "further single crystal diffraction data  @xcite , however , revealed a more complicated picture .",
    "the observed broad diffraction peaks show that the @xmath25 component ( corresponding to a collinear antiferromagnetically coupled structure ) is of short - range order type .",
    "the planes of diffuse scattering corresponding to another kind of magnetic order appear to be nearly perfectly commensurate , _",
    "i.e. _ the parameter @xmath31 is almost zero for them , although the variations of the intensity have been seen in both the @xmath34 and @xmath35 planes in reciprocal space .",
    "this observation suggests that the second type of short - range order present in @xmath3  is principally one - dimensional in nature , that is the magnetic structure is essentially a collection of afm coupled chains running along the @xmath6 axis with the intrachain correlations remaining rather weak down to lowest temperatures .",
    "similarly to what have been observed in @xmath2 , a magnetic component with the propagation vector @xmath25 exists below a well - defined transition temperature , while the one - dimensional scattering is observed at much higher temperatures .",

    "in contrast to the other members of the @xmath0  family investigated so far , @xmath4  does not show any sign of magnetic phase transition down to the lowest available temperatures . in zero field , heat capacity @xmath41 measurements indicate that this compound appears to be magnetically disordered down to at least  0.39  k ( see fig .",

    "the @xmath38 curve shows a very broad maximum at 0.77  k and a nearly linear temperature dependence below this peak .",
    "there are no sharp features in the heat capacity curve which can be attributed to a phase transition to a magnetically ordered state .",
    "pnd data for @xmath4  show no signs of any long - range magnetic order down to 20  mk , as the scattering pattern in zero field is dominated by broad diffuse scattering peaks  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic entropy recovered in @xmath4  between zero temperature and @xmath42  k ( see inset in fig .",
    "[ fig5_sdo_cvst ] ) amounts to @xmath43 , which suggests that at the lowest temperature the system is essentially a doublet with the magnetic moments restricted to point only along the easy axis ( ising ) direction .",

    "this implies that the spins of the ho@xmath26 ions are not fully aligned at this field . for @xmath47",

    "although the plateau is not well - pronounced , i.e. the derivative @xmath44 remains positive and relatively large between the maxima , one has to remember that the temperature for these measurements was relatively high , 0.5  k. for @xmath48  k ( see right - hand panels in fig .",
    "[ fig6_sho_mvsh ] ) , the plateau in the magnetisation disappears .",
    "therefore , it is likely that at the temperatures approaching 0  k the plateau will be much more obvious .",
    "the value of the magnetisation on the plateau is about a third of the value observed in higher field .",

    "<S> recent progress in the understanding of the complex magnetic properties of the family of rare - earth strontium oxides , @xmath0 , is reviewed . </S>",
    "<S> these compounds consisting of hexagons and triangles are affected by geometrical frustration and therefore exhibit its characteristic features , such as a significant reduction of magnetic ordering temperatures and complex phase diagrams in an applied field . </S>",
    "<S> some of the observed features appear to be rather remarkable even in the context of the unusual behaviour associated in geometrically frustrated magnetic systems . </S>",
    "<S> of particular interest is the coexistence at the lowest temperature of different magnetic structures ( exhibiting either long or short - range order ) characterised by different propagation vectors in materials without significant chemical or structural disorder . </S>"
