    "this paper is a theoretical extension of our recent letter @xcite on nanoscale stratification of local field and atomic dipole excitation in low - dimensional lattices driven by a laser at the frequency of the resonant atomic transition .",
    "we focus here on the most fundamental case of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) array of resonant atoms , and construct a detailed theory of both linear and nonlinear interactions in the system , resulting in such phenomena as sub - wavelength spatial modulation ( stratification ) of polarization and local field , long - wave and short - wave stratification , size - related resonances and large field enhancement , `` magic '' numbers , ferromagnetic- and antiferromagneticlike atomic polarization , optical bistability and hysteresises , etc .",
    "in addition to the results @xcite and their derivations , we also present new results ( i ) on the size - related resonances using a many - body approximation involving interactions of each atom with all other atoms in the array , beyond the ising - like approximation whereby atoms only interact with their nearest neighbors , ( ii ) on traveling locsiton waves and their dissipation , as well as an estimate of the maximum size of the 1d array to support most of the effects discussed here , ( iii ) on hysteresises and optical bistability in arbitrarily long arrays , and ( iv ) general mathematical consideration of dispersion relation in the self - interacting arrays for dipole approximation and beyond it .",
    "it is well known that optical properties of sufficiently dense materials are substantially affected by the near - field interactions between neighboring particles at the frequency of the incident field , in particular , quasi - static ( non - radiative ) dipole interactions . the best known manifestation of this fact is the _ local vs incident field _ phenomenon and related lorentz  lorenz or clausius  mossotti relations @xcite for dielectric constant as a nonlinear function of the number density .",
    "the microscopic ( or _ local _ ) field ( lf ) , @xmath0 , acting upon atoms or molecules becomes then different from both the applied and average macroscopic fields because of inter - particle interaction . in the most basic case ,",
    "that relation between @xmath0 and the average field @xmath1 is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the dielectric constant of the material at the laser frequency @xmath4 .",
    "it is worth noting that we are not interested here in the relation between @xmath3 and the number density of the material , since in the case of small 1d or 2d arrays the issue is moot .",
    "for the same reason , it also makes sense to deal directly with the incident field , @xmath5 , instead of the averaged field . in most theories of those interactions a traditional standard ( and",
    "at that often implicit ) assumption , reflected also in the above formula , is that the local field and polarization are uniform in the near neighborhood of each particle at least at the distances shorter than the wavelength of light , @xmath6 .",
    "this essentially amounts to the so called `` mean - field approximation '' .",
    "it was shown by us @xcite , however , that if the _ local uniformity _ is not presumed , then , under certain conditions on the particle density and their dipole strengths , the system of interacting particles is bound to exhibit periodic spatial variations of polarization and local - field amplitude",
    ". these variations result in sub - wavelength strata with a nanoscale period much shorter than @xmath6 . under certain conditions ,",
    "the system may exhibit an ultimate non - uniformity , whereby each pair of neighboring atoms in 1d arrays has their dipoles counter - oscillating with respect to each other , i.e.  their excitations and thus local fields have opposite signs .    to a certain extent",
    "this is reminiscent of the situation in magnetic materials with _",
    "ferromagnetic vs antiferromagnetic _ effects . indeed , the mean - field approximation which is at the root of the curie ",
    "weiss theory of _ ferromagnetism _",
    "@xcite , is based on the assumption of uniform polarization of all the neighboring magnetic dipoles even without external magnetic field , when taking into account their interaction with each other .",
    "contrary to that , the ising theory @xcite , which does not make the assumption of uniformity , showed that even in the near - neighbor approximation for that interaction , the excitation may result in counter - polarization of neighboring atoms in 1d arrays , and thus in a new phenomenon of _ antiferromagnetism_. note here that in these effects there is no notion of `` local '' _ vs _ `` external '' field phenomenon : in a `` pure '' case of either of the magnetic effects , no external field is applied ; the effects here are the result of self - organization of permanent , `` hard '' , atomic dipoles with pre - existing _ dc _ dipole fields , without any `` help from outside '' .    in this lies a profound difference between _ dc _ magnetic material phenomena ( ferro- and antiferromagnetism ) on the one hand  and the effects considered by us here and in @xcite on the other hand ,",
    "all of which are based on the _ optical _ ( or , in general , any other quantum or classical resonance ) excitation of atoms ( or other small particles , e.g.  quantum dots , clusters , small - particle plasmons , etc . ) .",
    "while magnetic dipoles in ferromagnetics are nonzero even in the absence of an external field ( we may call them `` hard '' dipoles ) , the oscillating dipoles ( in the linear case ) can be induced only by the driving field at the near - resonant frequency , so they can be called `` soft '' dipoles ; without such a driving their polarization vanishes .",
    "because in dense material the atoms actually are acted upon by _ local _ field , the response of each one of them may differ from the others by phase and amplitude ( or even direction ) , with some of the dipoles fully suppressed while others fully excited . thus the effects considered here are induced by the interplay of external and local fields , which put the entire phenomenon squarely into the domain of relations between the local and incident fields . because of that , since the phenomenon depends strongly on the characteristics of the incident field ( polarization , frequency , and , in the nonlinear case , intensity ) , the spatial modulation of the dipole excitation and local field can vary substantially .",
    "this results in a wealth of different patterns , some of them reminiscent of the ferromagnetic , other of antiferromagnetic , but the most of them forming all kinds of hybrid patterns .",
    "the complete cross - over from ferromagneticlike to antiferromagneticlike state of the system with all the intermediate states can be attained then by simply tuning laser frequency .",
    "another significant difference here is that the system size is small .",
    "provided there is sufficiently strong interparticle interaction , the new phenomenon can occur in the vicinity of boundaries , lattice defects , impurities or in sufficiently small group of atoms ; recent advances in technology allow fabrication of nanoscale structures with small numbers of atoms . thus , our theory emphasizes phenomena in relatively small ordered arrays of interacting atoms , in contrast to , e.g. , microscopic models of ferromagnetism that mostly focus on averaged , `` thermodynamic '' perspective on sufficiently large systems .",
    "this brings forward a new set of nanoscale phenomena . harking back to ferromagnetic systems ,",
    "this new emphasis may reveal similar phenomena for nanoscale magnetic systems , which could be an exciting topic for a separate study .",
    "our choice of 1d and 2d dielectric systems based on the arrays or lattices of atoms , quantum dots , clusters , molecules , etc .",
    ", allows to control anisotropy of near - field interaction .",
    "it also eliminates the issues of electromagnetic ( em ) propagation being modified by the effects as the em wave propagates through the structure ( especially if it propagates normally to the lattice ) .",
    "if _ local uniformity _ is broken by any perturbation , the system may exhibit near - periodic spatial sub-@xmath6 patterns ( strata ) of polarization .",
    "in general , two major modes of the strata transpire : _ short - wave _ ( sw ) , with the period up to four interatomic spacings , @xmath7 , and _ long - wave _ ( lw ) strata .",
    "the strata are standing waves of elementary lf excitations ( called _ locsitons _ in @xcite ) having a near - field , electrostatic , nature and low group velocity .    in the first approximation ,",
    "the phenomenon is linear in the driving field , and the locsitons may be excited within a spectral band much broader than the atomic linewidth .",
    "it can be viewed as a rabi broadening of an atomic line by interatomic interactions .",
    "the strata are controlled by laser polarization and the strength of atom coupling , @xmath8 , _ via _ atomic density , dipole moments , relaxation , and detuning .",
    "once @xmath9 , the lf uniformity can be broken by boundaries , impurities , vacancies in the lattice , etc .",
    "a striking manifestation of the effect is large field resonances due to locsiton eigenmodes in finite lattices , and  at certain , `` magic '' numbers of atoms in the lattice ",
    "almost complete cancellation of field suppression at the atomic resonance ; saturation nonlinearity results in hysteresises and optical bistability .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we derive the main equations for self - interacting atomic lattices of arbitrary dimensions using two - level ( nonlinear in general ) model for atomic resonances and dipole ",
    "dipole interaction between atoms , while section  [ sec3 ] is on specific equations for linear infinite and finite 1d arrays . in section",

    "we concentrate on detailed theory of resonances beyond the near - neighbor approximation , including evanescent solutions ( see also section  [ sec4 ] ) .",
    "magic numbers are considered in section  [ sec7 ] . in section  [ sec8 ] ,",

    "our model is based on the near - field dipole atomic interactions , with the incident frequency @xmath4 being nearly resonant to an atomic transition with a dipole moment @xmath10 at the frequency @xmath11 . in the linear case ,",
    "i.e.  when the laser intensity is significantly lower than that for the quantum transition saturation ( see below ) , the result of this model coincides with that of a classical harmonic oscillator formed by an electron in a harmonic potential with the same resonant frequency @xmath11 and with the dipole moment @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the compton wavelength of electron .    in a standard lf situation , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , the field of an elementary dipole with the polarization @xmath16 is dominated in its near vicinity by a non - radiative , quasi - static ( and only electric ) component , which is strongly anisotropic in space .",
    "this dominant term in the near - field area , @xmath17 , attenuates as @xmath18 ( see e.g.  @xcite , section  72 ) . at @xmath19 the amplitude of the field of an oscillating dipole located at @xmath20 induces a field at the point of observation @xmath21 with the amplitude coinciding with that of an elementary static dipole with the same polarization @xmath22 : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a unit vector in the direction of observation , and @xmath3 is a background dielectric constant .",
    "we will model a resonant atomic transition by a basic two - level atom in a steady - state mode under the action of a field , @xmath25 , with the amplitude @xmath1 and frequency @xmath4 , and assume that @xmath26 , so that the wave functions of neighboring atoms do not overlap . using a semi - classical approach standard in lf theory of resonant atoms",
    "@xcite , we can now find the atomic polarization as : @xmath27 where @xmath16 is the polarization amplitude [ the full polarization is then @xmath28 ; @xmath29 is the population difference , with @xmath30 and @xmath31 being atomic populations at respective ground and excited levels ( @xmath32 ) , @xmath33 is a dimensionless detuning from the resonant frequency @xmath11 of the two - level atom , @xmath34 is a _ transverse _ relaxation time ( the time of polarization relaxation ) and @xmath35 is the ( homogeneous ) linewidth of the linear resonance .",
    "is comprised of two contributions @xcite : one is the so called natural radiation linewidth @xmath36 , which is due to spontaneous radiation at the resonant frequency of the respective quantum transition of a single atom in vacuum , and the other one , @xmath37 , is due to all other processes , mostly phase broadening , non - radiative transitions , and radiative ones to non - resonant quantum levels .",
    "it is worth noting that when the atoms are very close to each other , @xmath38 , due to atomic interactions the radiation linewidth , @xmath36 , of each atom can be broadened up if the neighboring dipoles move in phase ( as in long - wave locsitons ) , or narrowed down if those dipoles move in counter - phase ( as in short - wave locsitons ) . in general case",
    "this effect should be taken into consideration too .",
    "however , we assume here that , as is usual for atoms in a dense - material environment ( e.g.  when they are positioned at the surface of some material or embedded in it ) , @xmath39 , and we ignore here the natural linewidth , @xmath36 and its broadening . ] in turn , the steady - state population difference is @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a _ longitudinal _ relaxation time ( life - time of the excited atom ) , and @xmath42 is an equilibrium population difference at the system temperature due to boltzmann s distribution ; in optics one can usually assume @xmath43 , so that @xmath44^{-1 }   \\equiv f_\\mathrm{nl}(|e|^2 ) , \\nonumber \\\\ e_\\mathrm{sat}^2 & = & \\frac{\\hbar^2}{|d_a|^2 } \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\tau t } , \\label{eq2.5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the saturation intensity , and @xmath46 is nonlinearity due to saturation . substituting ( [ eq2.5 ] ) into ( [ eq2.3 ] ) , one obtains a closed - form expression for the polarization , @xmath47 for a classical harmonic ( linear ) oscillator we have : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the mass of electron .",
    "the local field @xmath50 at each atom is the incident laser field , @xmath5 , plus the sum of the near - fields , @xmath51 ( [ eq2.2 ] ) , induced by all the surrounding dipoles at @xmath20 acted upon by the respective local fields @xmath52 , i.e. @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes summation over the entire lattice or array . to obtain a closed - form master equation , e.g.  for @xmath50 alone , we use ( [ eq2.6 ] ) to write : @xmath55           - { \\mathbf{e}}_\\mathrm{l}({\\mathbf{r } } ' ) \\right\\ } f_\\mathrm{nl } [ |{\\mathbf{e}}_\\mathrm{l } ( { \\mathbf{r}}')|^2 ] , \\label{eq2.9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 are local fields only at the locations of atoms in the lattice and not at any other points inside or outside it ; @xmath57 is a tuning - dependent strength of dipole ",
    "dipole interaction , and the maximum absolute strength , @xmath58 , is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the fine - structure constant , and nonlinear factor @xmath61 is as in ( [ eq2.5 ] ) . for a classical harmonic oscillator , ( [ eq2.1 ] ) , we have @xmath62 where @xmath63  nm is the classical radius of electron .    eqs .  ( [ eq2.8 ] ) , ( [ eq2.9 ] )",
    "reflect many - body nature of the interaction . a conventional approach to local fields within the lorentz ",
    "lorenz theory is to look for a self - consistent solution for the fields in this interaction , with an assumption , however , that they are _ uniform _ ( the mean - field theory ) , i.e.to set @xmath64 and also use an encapsulating sphere around the observation point .",
    "these assumptions effectively shut out any strong spatial variations of the atomic excitations and local field that may exist at the inter - atomic scale .",
    "that is where we depart from the lorentz ",
    "lorenz theory ; _ none of those assumptions are used here _ , and our approach is to use general expressions ( [ eq2.8 ] ) or ( [ eq2.9 ] ) and seek straightforward solution for them .",
    "we will see below that the major critical condition for the phenomenon to exist and be observable at least at other optimal conditions is that @xmath58 exceeds some critical value , @xmath65 .",
    "three parameters are critical in this respect : atomic dipole moment @xmath66 , the spacing between atoms , @xmath7 , and the atomic linewidth , @xmath35 , since @xmath67 .",
    "to get an idea of whether the above critical condition is realistic , let us look first at the case of a gas - like collection of atoms , with the relaxed requirement on the spacing @xmath7 .",
    "large dipole moments and narrow resonances in , e.g. , _ alkali _ vapors @xcite or co@xmath68 gas @xcite , in solids @xcite , quantum wells and clusters may greatly enhance the phenomenon and allow for @xmath7 from sub - nanometer to a few tens of nanometers .",
    "considering an example with @xmath69   , corresponding to the volume density of @xmath70  @xmath71 , @xmath72   ,  @xmath73  @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , all of which are reasonable data , we obtain @xmath77 , which provides a margin large enough to see all the effects discussed here .",
    "it is also of interest to roughly estimate what is the upper limit for @xmath58 . to that end , consider the extreme situation of @xmath78 ( solid - state- or liquid - like packing of participating atoms ) , in which case we have the ceiling for @xmath58 as @xmath79 even taking into consideration significant line broadening , @xmath35 , @xmath80 may exceed unity by many order of magnitude , thus providing huge margin for the existence and observation of locsitons and related effects .",
    "we consider here the most basic model of a 1d array of @xmath81 atoms lined up along the @xmath82 axis , spaced by @xmath7 , and driven by a laser propagating normally to the array and having an arbitrary polarization ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .        in the linear case , @xmath83 , when in ( [ eq2.9 ] ) @xmath84 ,",
    "it is sufficient to consider effects caused by linearly polarized light with either one of the two mutually orthogonal polarizations ; any other polarization ( e.g.  a circular one ) can be treated as a linear combination of those two . in the case of a 1d array , natural choices for these two basic configurations",
    "are :    * the incident field @xmath5 is parallel to the @xmath82 axis , @xmath85 ( and the dipoles line up `` head - to - tail '' ; we will call it @xmath86-configuration ) , and * @xmath5 is normal to the @xmath82 axis , @xmath87 ( `` side - by - side '' lineup ; @xmath88-configuration ) .",
    "the general solution will be a linear vectorial superposition of these two .",
    "this choice of the basic configurations is dictated by the simplicity of the resulting polarization of the local field .",
    "indeed , in both cases , it follows that the polarization of local field is parallel to that of the incident field , @xmath89 , so we can use scalar equations for all fields . using the dimensionless notation @xmath90_{(p)}$ ] , where @xmath91 denotes polarization , @xmath92 or @xmath93 , and recalling that now @xmath94 , we write ( [ eq2.9 ] ) for both configuration as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a form - factor due to polarization configuration : @xmath97 and @xmath98 .    if the 1d array is infinite , @xmath99 , or sufficiently long , @xmath100 , it is instructive to rewrite ( [ eq3.1 ] ) in the form @xmath101 where @xmath102 . the sums over @xmath103 in ( [ eq3.1 ] ) , ( [ eq3.2 ] ) converge rather fast ,",
    "hence @xmath104 is not too large , see also appendix  [ app ] below .",

    "( fia ) , whereby each atom `` talks '' to all the other atoms in the array , which presents a challenge to an analytical treatment .",
    "of course , a linear equation ( [ eq3.1 ] ) for @xmath105 is solved analytically using a standard linear algebra approach with matrices . however , analyzing the results for large - size arrays , @xmath100 , in particular analytically finding all the resonances in @xmath106 , can only be done by using numerical matrix solver , even if we neglect the dissipation .    thus , there is a need for a simple approximation that would preserve most of the qualitative features of the phenomenon , yet could be easily analyzed analytically .",
    "this can be done by using the near - neighbor approximation ( nna ) , similar to that of the ising model of ( anti)ferromagnetism , in which the full sum in ( [ eq3.1 ] ) or ( [ eq3.2 ] ) is replaced by the sum over the nearest neighbors , @xmath107 in the ultimate two - atom case , @xmath108 @xcite , the two approaches merge .",
    "the further two - near - neighbors approximation ( 2-nna ) and even three - near - neighbors approximation are considered in section  [ sec6 ] below .",
    "we found , however , that in general , a full summation ( fia ) in ( [ eq3.1 ] ) on the one hand , and nna ( [ eq3.3 ] ) as well as 2-nna on the other hand , produce qualitatively similar results that differ by a factor of @xmath109 .    since effects discussed here are most pronounced in relatively small systems or in the small vicinity of perturbations in large lattices , it is natural to stipulate that the _ incident _ field within the array is uniform , unless otherwise is stated ; however , this condition can readily be arranged even for an array larger than @xmath6",

    "the lw and sw periods converge to the same scale , @xmath171 , see ( [ eq4.12 ] ) below . using the phonon analogy , the lw locsitons may be viewed to a certain extent as counterparts to acoustic , and sw  to optical phonons .    between those limiting points ",

    "one can think of them as sort of hybrids of ferromagneticlike and antiferromagneticlike behavior .",

    "these modes can be viewed as _ evanescent waves / locsitons _ , see also below , section  [ sec6 ] .",

    "as we mentioned above , while the quantization of locsitons in finite arrays can be readily analyzed analytically within nna , see the previous sections [ sec3 ] and  [ sec5 ] , the situation with fully - interacting arrays ( fia ) presents a challenge for an analytical treatment .",

    "the nna - predicted resonances coincide more closely with those obtained by fia numerical calculations .",
    "the major source of these effects is the first factor , i.e.a strongly asymmetric ( with respect to the detuning frequency , @xmath146 ) shape of the dispersion relation , fig .",
    "a more detailed mathematical consideration of this problem , including a very good _ analytical _ fit for the dispersion relation is found in appendix  [ app ] below .",
    "less significant , although interesting as far as the eigenmodes of 1d arrays are concerned , is the fact that simple nna eigen - wavenumbers ( [ eq5.3 ] ) , @xmath219 , obtained based on the nna boundary conditions @xmath193 [ eq .  ( [ eq3.3 ] ) ]",

    "[ the fia results will essentially differ only by a factor of @xmath109 ] , we have @xmath339 , and thus the nonlinear equation for the uniform local field , @xmath340 , is @xmath341 = x , \\label{eq9.4}\\ ] ] or for the field intensity , @xmath342 , @xmath343 ^ 2           + \\delta_\\mathrm{ll}^2}{(1 + \\delta^2 + y ) ^2 } = x^2 . \\label{eq9.5}\\ ] ] it can be readily seen that the strongest nonlinear effect emerges near the lorentz  lorenz resonance , @xmath344 . assuming small losses , @xmath345",
    ", we can analyze the threshold of the multistability and hysteresis mode by stipulating that @xmath346 , @xmath347 , and thus ( [ eq9.5 ] ) can be further simplified as @xmath348       / \\delta_\\mathrm{ll}^4 \\approx x^2 . \\label{eq9.6}\\ ] ] the threshold for the multistable solution @xmath349 of this equation is determined by the condition @xmath350 , which results in the critical requirement that @xmath351 amazingly , as one recalls that @xmath352 and @xmath295 , the critical ( threshold ) driving intensity @xmath353 to initiate multistability and hysteresis could be orders of magnitude lower than the saturation one , @xmath45 , which is mostly due to resonant nature of the effect that emerge in the vicinity of the lorentz ",
    "lorenz resonance .",
    "thus , the required saturation nonlinearity is indeed just a slight perturbation to the resonant linear mode .",
    "this should be of no big surprise , since the nature of the effect is the same as in many other so called _ vibrational hysteresises _",
    "@xcite in resonant nonlinear systems , from pendulum @xcite to electronic circuits @xcite , to optical bistability in a fabri ",
    "perot resonator @xcite , to a cyclotron resonance of a slightly relativistic electron @xcite .",
    "in all these nonlinear resonances , it is enough for a narrow resonant curve to be tilted beyond its resonance width to reach multistability by becoming a `` pisa - like tower '' .",
    "the formation of bistability and hysteresis is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , where the resonant curve @xmath354 is shown for different driving @xmath334 for the full equation ( [ eq9.5 ] ) .     _",
    "vs _ detuning @xmath146 for different normalized driving amplitudes @xmath352 for the case of @xmath355.,width=325 ]    the formation of a tri - stable solution results in the so called bistability , whereby only the states with the maximum and minimum intensities are stable , whereas the middle branch of the solution is absolutely unstable . to an extent ,",
    "it is similar to one of the hysteretic patterns for the local field found for the case of the local field @xcite and scattered light @xcite of just two atoms ; the hysteretic resonance here is produced by a lorentz - like , or ferromagneticlike , excitation of atoms with lw locsitons .",
    "this effect is also reminiscent of optical intrinsic bistability for uniform lf in dense materials predicted earlier in @xcite and observed experimentally in @xcite .",
    "the above result for hysteresis and bistability was found for the uniform , lorentz , field , i.e.  near the lorentz ",
    "lorenz resonance , using a simple field distribution .",
    "however , it is clear from the above argument with a `` pisa - like tower '' , a similar hysteretic effect can be expected in the close vicinity of _ every _ size - related locsiton resonance within the locsiton band .",
    "some of the most interesting hysteresises , though , are excited for the sw locsitons , when the nearest atoms counter - oscillate in an antiferromagneticlike fashion , as shown in @xcite for the anti - lorentz band edge for two atoms .",
    "this hysteresis results in a `` split - fork '' bistability and will be discussed by us in application to long arrays elsewhere .",
    "it is only natural to expect the effects studied here to manifest themselves in other finite systems of discrete resonant oscillators that are externally driven and interact with each other . on the one hand , this may help to demonstrate and verify some major results reported here in much simpler and easily handleable settings ; on the other hand , this may bring up new features in these other systems that escaped attention in seemingly well developed and researched fields .",
    "we consider here a few such systems .    perhaps , the most classical example would be a mechanical finite array of identical physical pendulums with the same individual resonant frequencies , weakly coupled to each other ( say , by using weak strings between neighboring pendulums ) , with each pendulum driven independently by an external feed ( say , _ via _ em solenoids ) with the same phase for all of them . by tuning the frequency of the driving feed around the resonant frequency of the pendulums",
    ", one may expect to observe stratified excitation of the pendulums , from long - wave , ferromagneticlike strata , to short - wave , antiferromagneticlike ones .",
    "one can also expect to observe `` magic '' numbers and related effect of non - moving pendulums surrounded by strongly excited ones .",
    "( it is worth noting that we are talking here about a _ cw _",
    "motion , in contrast to the well known effect in two coupled non - driven pendulums , whereby the pendulums periodically alternate periods of zero - excitation in one and strong excitation in the other one , with the frequency of the alternation being inversely proportional to the coupling . ) the major effect here would be again due to locsitons , and the major critical condition for their excitation would be similar to the condition on the strength of interaction , @xmath58 , ( [ eq2.10 ] ) , to exceed a critical one .",
    "the driven pendulum array would be a great classroom - demonstration tool .",
    "however , although purely mechanical , it might take some effort to implement , due to the need of an independent feed to each pendulum . from that point of view ,",
    "a much simpler , easily implementable , controllable , recordable , and versatile system could be an electronic array of individual resonant circuits , electronically coupled to each other .",
    "a long while ago , similar systems have been used as transmission lines , whereas a finite set of circuits has also been of interest for such applications as bandpass filters .",
    "however , the detailed picture of behavior of individual circuits inside such systems have apparently not attracted too much attention , with a few reasons for that .",
    "the main difference between these systems and the ones proposed by us , is that we need an independent feed with the same phase for each individual circuit , which may be arranged , by e.g.  using individual cable for each one of them .",
    "the coupling between the individual circuits can be engineered in such a way that one can arrange strictly near - neighbor interaction , two - near - neighbors interaction , etc . besides , the contribution of each neighboring circuit can be independently controlled , so the term @xmath356 can now be changed to any desirable function of the neighbor spacing .",
    "a close example , which might have important implications for large radio - frequency antenna arrays , for e.g.  radio - astronomy applications , as well as in multi - dish radar systems , is the interaction of radiators in those arrays , if the strength of this interaction exceeds some critical value .",
    "since in the case of electronic circuits the polarization of the feed and the spatial anisotropy as in ( [ eq2.2 ] ) is not a factor anymore , the dipole - like interaction is simplified , as its spatial polarization form - factor @xmath96 ( as in section  [ sec3 ] ) can be now dropped , and the equations of motion ( [ eq3.1])([eq3.4 ] ) can be simplified . furthermore , since now the direction of a `` dipole '' with respect to the `` incident polarization '' is not a factor , one can arrange a _ loop _ or _ ring _ of those circuits , instead of a linear 1d array , which allows for periodic boundary condition instead of zero boundary conditions as e.g.  in ( [ eq3.1 ] ) .",
    "this would greatly simplify the theory and comparison with the experiment , on the one hand , and allow for new interesting effects in ring arrays ( such as e.g.  greatly enhanced sagnac effect and related gyroscope applications ) , to be discussed by us elsewhere , on the other hand .    an interesting and exotic opportunity with 1d arrays , and especially ring arrays ,",
    "is a possibility to develop a toy model of `` discrete space quantum mechanics '' , whereby a wave function is replaced by a set of oscillating fields at discrete spatial points , instead of a regular wave distributed in space .",
    "this discrete - space quantum mechanics ( qm ) could be of interest for the theory of certain systems , as well as from fundamental point of view ; for example , the ring arrays then would allow to build a theory of a bohr - like `` discrete - qm h atom '' , with finite number of primary quantum numbers , unlike an infinite numbers of quantum levels as in a regular - qm h atom .",
    "a very interesting analogy , especially from the application point of view , is _ magnetic spin resonance _ , in particular _ nuclear magnetic resonance _",
    "( nmr ) @xcite , as well as magnetic resonances in finite spin systems , in particular so called molecular magnets @xcite .",
    "they have some common points with the interacting systems considered here , in particular , two - level nature of resonances in both systems .    in optical domain , an observation of the effect discussed here",
    "can be done in a few ways .",
    "nanostrata and locsitons can be observed either _ via _ size - related resonances in scattering of laser radiation , or _ via _ x - ray or electron energy loss spectroscopy of the strata .",
    "the effect has promising potential for molecular computers @xcite and nanodevices .",
    "the major advantage of locsitons _ vs _ electrons in semiconductors is that they are not based on electric current or charge transfer .",
    "this may allow for a drastic reduction of the size limit for computer logic elements currently based on metal - oxide - semiconductor technology , which may suffer from many irreparable problems on a scale below 10  nm .",
    "as such , locsiton - based devices could be an interesting entry into the field , as complimentary or alternative to emerging technologies like plasmonics @xcite or spintronics @xcite .",
    "they can offer both passive ( e.g.  transmission lines and delays ) , and active elements , e.g.  for switching and logics .",
    "a ring - array may be used as a basis for a sagnac - locsiton - based gyroscope ; low locsiton velocity may allow for a high sensitivity in a small ring .",
    "another promising application of locsitons could be biosensing devices , where target - specific receptor molecules either form a locsiton - supporting lattice or are attached to its sites ; a localized locsiton occurs whenever a target biomolecule attaches to a receptor .    finally , exciting opportunities exist in atomic arrays and lattices with inverse population created by an appropriate ( e.g.  optical ) pumping , which may lead to a laser - like locsiton stimulated emitter ( `` locster '' ) , to be discussed elsewhere .",
    "in conclusion , in this study of strong stratification of local field and dipole polarization in finite groups of atoms predicated by us earlier @xcite , we developed a detailed theory of the phenomenon in one - dimensional arrays of atom or resonant particles .",
    "in strong departure from lorentz  lorenz theory , the spatial period of those strata may become much shorter than the incident wavelength . by exploring nanoscale elementary excitations , locsitons , and resulting size - related resonances and large field enhancement in finite arrays of atoms",
    ", we showed that their spatial spectrum has both long waves , reminiscent of ferromagnetic domains , and super - short waves corresponding to the counter - oscillating neighboring polarizations , reminiscent of antiferromagnetic spins .",
    "the system also exhibits `` hybrid '' modes of excitation that have no counterpart in magnetic ordering , and are more representative of the effect .",
    "our theory that goes beyond ising - like near - neighbor approximation and describes the excitation whereby each atom interacts with all the other atoms in the array , reveals the existence of infinite spectrum of `` exponential '' , or `` evanescent '' eigenmodes in the such arrays .",
    "we explored the phenomenon of `` magic '' numbers of atoms in an array , whereby resonant local - field suppression can be canceled for certain atoms in an array .",
    "we also demonstrated the existence of nonlinearly induced optical bistability and hysteresis in the system .",
    "we discussed a stratification effect similar to that in atomic arrays , which may exist in broad variety of self - interacting systems , from mechanical ( pendulums ) to electronic circuits , to radar arrays , and to the nuclear magnetic resonance .",
    "we pointed out a few potential applications of the atomic and similar arrays in such diverse field as low - losses nano - elements for optical computers , small - size sagnac - effect - based gyroscopes , and bio - censors .",
