    "it has been generally accepted that the herbig - haro outflows ( jets ) from young stellar objects become optically visible through the shocks ( bow shocks and jet shocks , mach disks ) at their working surfaces ( mundt & fried 1983 ; hartmann & raymond 1984 ; bhm & solf 1985 ; schwartz 1985 ; mundt 1985 ; hartigan , raymond & hartmann 1987 ; reipurth 1989 ; hartigan 1989 ; solf & bhm 1991 ; reipurth & heathcote 1993 ; eisloeffel , mundt & bhm 1994 ; raga 1995 ) . in other words , in hh objects",
    "we see matter ( if it is observed in a bow shock ) that originally comes from the molecular cloud and has recently gone through the shock and through an essential part of the cooling region of the shock .",
    "recently , it has also become clear that , in a number of herbig - haro ( hh ) objects , we can identify `` internal working surfaces '' and their bow shocks ( raga 1995 ; reipurth & heathcote 1997 ; reipurth et al .",
    "1997 ; raga & noriega - crespo 1998 ) .",
    "that is , in a number of hh objects ( e.g. , in hh 111 or in hh 34 ) , the cloud matter has passed through multiple shocks .    in molecular clouds ( including the boundary regions of the clouds , which are accessible to optical hh observations )",
    ", we expect that the gas phase abundances of elements like fe or ca are considerably depleted ( by a factor of on the order of 100 ) because of the formation of dust grains ( van dieshoeck et al .",
    "if one takes into account the fact that refractory elements like fe and ca can return to the gas phase by the destruction of the dust grains in sufficiently strong shocks ( @xmath3 km s@xmath4 ; e.g. , mckee et al .",
    "1987 ; seab 1987 ; draine 1995 ) , we might expect that hh objects will show different fe / h or ca / h ratios that depend on the velocity of the shock through which the visible matter has passed before it is observed .",
    "the ( admittedly very naive ) expectation would be that `` low excitation objects '' ( slow shocks , @xmath5 km s@xmath4 ) , would have rather small gas phase fe and ca abundances because these elements remain in the dust grains . in `` high excitation objects '' ( fast shocks , @xmath6 km s@xmath4 )",
    ", we might expect the dust grains to be destroyed , at least partially , by the shock .",
    "the gas phase abundance of elements like fe or ca would be high ( solar ? ) .",
    "this hypothesis inspired beck - winchatz , bhm , & noriega - crespo ( 1994 , hereafter bbn94 ; 1996 , hereafter bbn96 ) to determine the fe gas phase abundance for a few objects .",
    "in both papers the authors decided that it would be most convenient ( for the study of dust grain survival ) to determine the fe abundance ( they derived the abundance ratio fe / s and fe / o ) .",
    "the effort required for carrying out this program for a single hh object is sizable .",
    "it requires reliable line spectrophotometry with fairly high spectral resolution in a fairly large wavelength interval and the detailed study of the statistical equlibrium of fe ( and a comparison element , either o or s ) . for this reason",
    "the program was carried out for only 5 hh objects , namely for hh 1 , hh 7 , hh 11 , hh 43a , and hh 255 ( burnham s nebula ; bbn94 , bbn96 ) .",
    "many of their results are surprising and do not ( in general ) agree with our above mentioned expectations .",
    "first , the fe abundance for both hh1 and hh7 are essentially solar ( with only 18% and 3% deviation , respectively ) .",
    "this is surprising because hh 1 is the standard high excitation object , while hh 7 is one of the lowest excitation objects known ( so we expect a low fe abundance ) .",
    "second , the fe abundance of the low excitation object hh 11 is ( for unknown reasons ) somewhat higher ( by a factor of 1.68 ) than the solar abundance . finally , the authors detected some depletion of fe in hh 43a ( fe / o about 38% and fe / s about 48% of the solar value ) and hh 255 ( fe / o about 71% and fe / s about 36% of the solar value ) , though these are high excitation objects .",
    "in judging these results we have to be aware that hh 255 is a somewhat complicated hh object ( see bhm & solf 1997 ; solf & bhm 1999 ) , to which some of the standard assumptions ( e.g. , that the line emission is exclusively caused by a bow shock in the working surface of the outflow ) may be only partly applicable .",
    "even if we exclude for the moment hh 255 from our consideration , it is clear that the earlier results do not agree with the simple expectations expressed above .",
    "one way to explain why the low excitation objects ( hh 7 and hh 11 ) show no fe depletion is to assume that the shocked gas we observe has passed through a much faster shock at some earlier time .    in order to clarify this problem , it is important to determine the gas phase fe abundance ( and correspondingly the destruction of dust grains ) in a larger number of hh objects .",
    "however , as discussed above , this is very difficult to do in detail .",
    "we therefore consider it presently justified to try to determine preliminary , ( very ) approximate values for the fe abundance in a larger number of hh objects , even if they are considerably less reliable than the earlier determinations of bbn96 .",
    "first , we want to mention related studies by other authors .",
    "hartigan et al .  ( 1999 , 2000 ) derived gas phase fe abundance in hh objects which approximately agree with bbn94 and bbn96 . in their 1999 paper , they studied the fe ii and [ fe ii ] spectrum for hh 47a in unusual detail , covering the bow shock and the mach disk separately .",
    "their conclusion was that the gas phase fe abundance is approximately solar .",
    "it is also worth noting that there has been another recent study of the gas phase fe abundance which gave a somewhat lower abundance ( on the average by a factor of 3 ) for hh objects by mouri & taniguchi ( 2000 ) .",
    "they use a plane shock wave model to calculate the theoretical line ratio [ fe ii ] 8617/[o i ] 6300 in considerable detail and compare this to observations of hh objects ( which are not individually listed ) .",
    "we agree ( of course ) that hh objects are caused by shock waves , but an attempt to explain in quantitative detail individual spectra by a ( plane or bow shock ) model leads to difficulties @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the approach of bbn94 and bbn96 was completely different .",
    "bbn94 and bbn96 studied the hh objects individually and tried to introduce ( where possible ) observationally determined parameters ( empirically determined densities , sizes , and electron temperatures of the line emitting regions in hh objects ) .",
    "they used different methods to get information about the ionization . in one method , for example , bbn96 determined the abundance ratio @xmath7 + n[fe\\ : iii]}\\over      { \\rm n[o\\ : i ] + n[o\\ : ii ] + n[o\\ : iii ] } } \\nonumber\\ ] ] ( where n[x ] is the number of [ x ] ions ) .",
    "( this does not require detailed theoretical information about the ionization . )",
    "they also based the derived abundance information on many lines ( e.g. , 42 [ fe ii ] lines in hh 1 ) .    since the approaches of @xcite and bbn94/96 are completely different ( one based on a detailed , but basically very simple model , the other on determining the empirical parameters for individual hh objects ) , we presently can not say which is more correct .",
    "this will depend on obtaining more insight into the detailed structure of individual hh objects .",
    "however , our following approach has been to employ knowledge of individual objects , and consequently , we follow the work of bbn96 .",
    "we proceed as follows : in  [ method ] , we introduce a characteristic number which uses the line fluxes of only a very few lines which are observed in reasonably many hh spectra ( which are not taken with the special purpose of determining the fe abundance , see raga , bhm , & canto 1996 for a reference to appropriate spectra ) .",
    "we show that the characteristic number is well correlated with the actual fe abundance for the 5 hh objects for which the fe abundance has been determined in detail ( bbn96 ) . in  [ application ] , we use this correlation to determine approximately the gas phase fe abundance in the other hh objects . finally , in  [ conclusions ]",
    ", we discuss the enigmatic results and suggest possible explanations .",
    "we want to develop a diagnostic method that uses only a few frequently observed lines .",
    "we will use the fe lines [ fe ii ] 5159 and [ fe ii ] 7155 , which have been observed in many objects .",
    "it would be nice to add a third fe line to the criterion .",
    "since there are no other fe lines as frequently observed in the optical spectrum as these , we have also used the [ ca ii ] 7291 line .",
    "this may appear somewhat inconsistent , since we wish to determine the fe abundance .",
    "however , one has to remember that the gas phase abundance of ca behaves similar to that of fe ( with regard to the dust grain destruction ) .",
    "( one also has to keep in mind that we are constructing a characteristic number which will be approximately correlated with the fe abundance but is not the fe abundance itself . ) using these lines , we define @xmath8\\ ; 5159}\\over{\\rm f}_{\\rm h\\beta } } +      { { \\rm f}_{\\rm [ fe\\ : ii]\\ ; 7155}\\over{\\rm f}_{\\rm h\\alpha } }   +      { { \\rm f}_{\\rm [ ca\\ : ii]\\ ; 7291}\\over{\\rm f}_{\\rm h\\alpha}}\\ ] ] where f@xmath9\\ ; 5159}$ ] is the measured flux of the [ fe ii ] 5159 line , and similarly for the [ fe ii ] 7155 and [ ca ii ] 7291 lines .",
    "the [ fe ii ] 5159 line is measured relative to the h@xmath2 flux , while [ fe ii ] 7155 and [ ca ii ] 7291 are relative to h@xmath1 .",
    "this is done to keep the error which is introduced by the different reddening of the hh objects small . in order to get a feeling for the possible error of this assumption , we use the reddening for hh 1 @xcite . in this case , e@xmath10 ( a@xmath11 ) .",
    "this leads to an error in f@xmath12\\ ; 5159}/{\\rm f}_{h\\beta}$ ] of 15.6% if we use the directly measured ratio instead of the reddening corrected ratio .",
    "for the case of f@xmath13\\ ; 7291}/{\\rm f}_{\\rm h\\alpha}$ ] , the corresponding error is 13.4% .",
    "we choose a proportionality constant so that all @xmath0 values are given relative to the value for hh 1 .",
    "it would also be possible to use the near ir [ fe ii ] lines ( see , e.g. , gredel 1994 ) , but the influence of the reddening on the ratio of , e.g. , [ fe ii ] 12570 , 16439 to h@xmath1 would cause additional problems .",
    "the question of whether this ( somewhat arbitrary ) definition of @xmath0 can be justified is best addressed by looking at the correlation of @xmath0 with the fe gas phase abundances of the 5 hh objects whose abundances have been studied in detail ( bbn94 , bbn96 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , this correlation between @xmath0 and the determined gas phase abundance of fe is evident . here , the iron abundance is normalized to 1 for the solar fe abundance .",
    "( this corresponds to the abundance ratio n(fe)/n(s ) = 2.95 or n(fe)/n(o ) = 0.55 , see grevesse & anders 1991 . )",
    "is it surprising that there is a reasonable correlation between such a simple interpolation formula as given in equation [ ame ] and the carefully determined fe abundance ?",
    "one might have expected that the characteristics of an individual hh object in question might have a sizable influence on the relation between @xmath0 and the fe abundance .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that the high excitation objects all have relatively similar shock structure ( shock velocities between 85 and 115 km s@xmath4 , see bhm & goodson 1997 ) .",
    "it is therefore apparent that , for these objects , the change in @xmath0 is mostly caused by a change in gas phase fe abundance , while changes of the model are much less important .",
    "it seems more surprising that there appears to be a continuous extension of the ( approximate ) correlation from the high excitation objects to the low excitation objects ( which would not be the case if the correlation depended only on the shock velocity ) .",
    "however , in this respect , it is important that ( for reasons which are not fully understood ) there is a typical observed difference between low and high excitation objects .",
    "high excitation objects typically have a pre - shock density of @xmath14 @xmath15 , while low excitation objects have a typical pre - shock density of @xmath16 @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "this change may contribute to an almost continuous extension of the relation between @xmath0 and fe abundance ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    for the purpose of determining the approximate fe abundance of additional hh objects , we assume that all five objects studied by bbn96 follow a one - dimensional relationship between @xmath0 and fe abundance .",
    "the data is well represented by a least squares fit to a second order polynomial .",
    "we assume , then , that the fe abundance ( relative to the sun ) of an hh object with an @xmath0 value ( relative to hh 1 ) in the range of the abscissa of figure [ fig1 ] is approximately @xmath17 this function overplots the data in figure [ fig1 ] and is applied to new @xmath0 values in figure [ fig2 ] ( see  [ application ] ) .",
    "we want to point out that we have no theoretical justification for the mathematical form of equation [ fit ] .",
    "however , the qualitative results of this work ( discussed below ) are not at all affected by the function chosen to fit the data .",
    "we determined the @xmath0 values for a number of additional hh objects using the photometric data from the reference list put together by raga et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in the footnote of their table 1 .",
    "the additional objects comprise 13 high and 3 low excitation hh objects .",
    "we would like to apply the correlation shown in figure [ fig1 ] and given in equation [ fit ] to these objects . to do so",
    ", we assume that the earlier studied hh objects are somehow `` typical , '' or that @xmath0 is insensitive to the differences in the detailed structure of each object .",
    "also , the new objects whose fe abundances we want to determine must have @xmath0 values in the range of the 5 hh objects whose fe abundances have been determined in detail .",
    "the objects studied in full detail cover the range from @xmath0 = 0.143 ( hh 43a ) to 1.452 ( hh 11 ) , while the newly studied objects cover the range from @xmath0 = 0.111 ( hh 123 ) to 1.601 ( hh 10 ) . in other words ,",
    "the newly added objects cover only a slightly larger range of @xmath0 .",
    "if we take into account that our selection of objects was sort of arbitrary ( based on the availability of spectra ) , the fact that the range in @xmath0 is relatively narrow may already tell us that , even among our extended list of hh objects , there is none whose gas phase fe abundance deviates strongly from the range of the 5 objects which were earlier studied in detail .",
    "consequently , we see no difficulty in this respect with applying our approximate method .",
    "at first we restrict ourselves to the study of high excitation objects because , in the present context , they are less problematic .",
    "as pointed out above , high excitation objects are physically similar to each other , so the correlation of @xmath0 with the fe abundance ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) is rather convincing .",
    "we use equation [ fit ] and the measured @xmath0 values for our list of additional objects to determine their fe abundance .",
    "the position of these objects in the @xmath0-fe abundance diagram is shown in figure [ fig2 ] .    in figure [ fig3 ]",
    "we have plotted the fe abundance as a function of the excitation of the hh object ( i.e. , as a function of the shock velocity ) , which is most easily measured by the line flux ratio [ o iii ] 5007/h@xmath2 in high excitation objects ( fig .",
    "3a ) and by the flux ratio [ n ii ] 5200/h@xmath2 in low excitation objects ( fig .",
    "the purpose of doing this is to determine whether the gas phase fe abundance depends on shock velocity .",
    "if there occurs a drastic grain destruction at some `` critical '' velocity ( leading to a drastic increase in the fe abundance ) , there would be a discontinuity ( or a steep slope ) in the fe abundance in figure 3 .",
    "a discontinuity could also indicate that , at certain shock velocity , our approximate method for the fe abundance determination breaks down .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] , however , indicates no dependence of the fe abundance on the excitation .",
    "the results for the high excitation objects ( fig .",
    "3a ) show an abundance close to 1 but slightly higher than 1 for 4 objects ( hh 54b : 1.05 , hh 1 : 1.18 , hh 40 : 1.32 , hh 54c : 1.42 ) .",
    "the other ( 12 ) objects show a ( relatively modest ) fe gas phase abundance depletion which seems to reach a limit of approximately a factor 2.5 ( hh 123 and hh 43a ) .",
    "our tentative conclusion is that , in our sample , there are 4 objects which have basically unchanged population i abundances for fe ( the reason being that dust grains have been destroyed by shock waves and the fe has gone back into the gas phase ) .",
    "we leave it open , whether the very slight overabundance ( 5% - 40% ) in these objects has to be considered as real or whether it may be a consequence of our approximate method .",
    "in addition to these objects , there are also high excitation objects ( including hh 123 , hh 43a or hh 2a ) where a certain fraction has gone back into the gas phase , but a part may still be contained in dust .",
    "thus , for high excitation hh objects , it seems reasonable that there are no objects for which a reasonably large fraction is still bound in dust .",
    "however , if we take into account that the dust destruction is a very sensitive function of the shock velocity @xcite , it is somewhat surprising that where there is depletion , it is never larger than a factor of 2.5",
    ".    it is also very interesting to note that different parts of the same hh objects ( which may be due to different shock waves , like hh2a and hh 2 g ; see eisloeffel , mundt & bhm 1994 ) tend to show the same gas phase fe abundances .",
    "this is obvious for hh 2a and hh 2 g as well as for hh 54b and hh 54c .",
    "surprisingly , this is also true for the objects hh 43a and hh 43b , c , where hh 43a is a high excitation and hh 43b , c are low excitation objects ( see fig . 3a and 3b ) .",
    "it may however be true that hh 43a and hh 43b , c form the apex and the `` wing '' of the same bow shock ( see the isophotic contour diagram of hh 43 presented in bhm & solf 1990 , fig .",
    "1 ) , so that in this case , the result is not too surprising .    though there are some aspects of our fe abundance results for high excitation hh objects which we do not yet completely understand , we can argue that the results in figure 3a correspond approximately to our expectations . as we shall now see",
    "the situation is not as satisfactory when we consider the low excitation hh objects .",
    "we proceed in an analogous way to the one used for high excitation objects .",
    "however , in this case we have available a total of only 5 objects , and the somewhat unexpected results have to be interpreted with considerable caution .",
    "of these 5 objects , 2 have been analyzed in full detail for their gas phase fe abundances ( bbn96 ) , namely hh 7 and hh 11 .",
    "for the other 3 objects , we determined the fe abundance using the same procedure as for the high excitation objects (  [ heos ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in figures 2 and 3b . in 3b , we have plotted the results again as a function of excitation ( shock wave velocity ) , which is now ( for the low excitation objects ) measured by the line ratio [",
    "n i ] 5200/h@xmath2 ( raga et al .  1996 ) because the [ o iii ] line used in the high excitation objects is not emitted in the low excitation objects .",
    "our results show that ( surprisingly ) 4 out of 5 low excitation outflows show a gas phase fe abundance which lies somewhat above the solar fe abundance ( by a factor of 1.02 to 1.86 ) .",
    "there is only one low excitation hh object , namely hh 43b , c , which shows some fe depletion .",
    "but even in this case , the fe depletion is almost identical to the fe depletion of the high excitation object hh 43a , with which it seems to be connected ( see above ) .",
    "the fact that 4 of the low excitation objects show an fe abundance somewhat larger than 1 may not be significant because our approximate method may not be very accurate , especially for low excitation objects .",
    "it is possible that the fe abundance in these objects corresponds reasonably well to the solar abundance .",
    "we are , however , surprised that 4 out of 5 low excitation hh objects show no depletion of the gas phase fe abundances .",
    "we would have ( naively ) expected that these objects show strong fe depletion ( by a factor of roughly 100 ) because no dust grains would have been destroyed in the weak shock waves of the low excitation objects .",
    "we would expect to see the original gas phase composition of the molecular cloud .",
    "we must conclude that the matter which is visible now in a low excitation hh object went through a shock wave of a much higher shock velocity at an earlier time .",
    "earlier detailed studies of the gas phase fe abundance for a very few hh objects had led to the conclusion that there is no simple correlation between the fe abundance and the hh shock velocity ( bbn94 , bbn96 ) .",
    "a correlation would have been expected if the molecular cloud matter enters the hh working surface and dust grains are destroyed in the hh bow shock by the usual processes ( mostly by non - thermal sputtering , see e.g. , mckee et al .",
    "1987 ; draine 1995 ) . since the study of bbn96",
    "is based on only 5 objects ( hh 1 , hh 7 , hh 11 , hh 43a , hh 255 ) , and adding more objects to this list using a detailed method requires great effort , we have derived fe abundances of 16 additional hh objects using a very approximate method .",
    "we introduced a characteristic number , @xmath0 ( eqn . [ fit ] ) , which depends on the ( frequently measured ) line fluxes of [ fe ii ] 5159 and [ fe ii ] 7155 , as well as on the [ ca ii ] 7291 line flux and the h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 fluxes . for the five hh objects ( mentioned above ) for which we have a detailed gas phase analysis ,",
    "@xmath0 is correlated reasonably well with the gas phase fe abundance .",
    "if we assume that this correlation is not only approximately correct for the 5 objects studied in detail , but for all hh objects for which we can determine @xmath0 , then we can use this correlation to determine their gas phase fe abundance .",
    "for the high excitation hh objects , our results are the following .",
    "in addition to the 3 high excitation objects for which the fe gas phase abundances have been measured in detail ( bbn96 ) , we have now determined the fe gas phase abundance for 13 more objects .",
    "of these 16 objects , 4 show a gas phase fe abundance between 1.0 and 1.44 times the solar abundance . taking into account the possible errors of the abundance determination ,",
    "this probably means that 4 of these objects have unchanged population i fe gas phase abundances ( no fe bound in dust grains ) .",
    "the other 12 high excitation objects show some ( but relatively small ) fe depletion which never gets larger than a factor of 2.5 .",
    "in general , the result looks reasonable .",
    "the high excitation hh objects show that , in some cases , fe has gone back completely to the gas phase , and in other cases , some ( but not too much ) fe may still be bound in dust grains , leading to moderate depletion of the gas phase abundance .",
    "we also find that similar depletion exists in different parts of the same object ( e.g. , in hh 2a and hh 2 g or in hh 54b and hh 54c ) .",
    "the gas phase fe abundance for high excitation objects agrees qualitatively with the predictions given , e.g. , by mckee et al.(1987 ) that dust grains are destroyed by strong shocks .",
    "the limit of the depletion factor of 2.5 is interesting but has not been explained in detail .",
    "understanding the results for the low excitation hh objects seems to be more difficult , and some questions remain open .",
    "the first problem is that we could study only 5 objects . for these objects",
    "we find quite unexpected results .",
    "four of them have an fe gas phase abundance between 1.02 and 1.86 times the solar fe abundances .",
    "one may argue that our uncertainty ( which is supposedly larger in the low excitation than in the high excitation objects ) might permit these to be consistent with 1 solar fe abundance .",
    "however , we still have the problem that low excitation objects ( for which we do not expect destruction of dust grains ) apparently have all or most of their fe in the gas phase .",
    "it is also important that we find no correlation of the fe abundance with shock velocity .",
    "while this is not surprising for the high excitation objects , we would have ( naively ) expected a large difference between the low and high excitation objects . specifically",
    ", we would have expected a strong fe depletion ( perhaps by a factor of 100 ) in the low excitation objects , since their shocks are not strong enough to destroy grains @xcite .",
    "the ( perhaps ) simplest explanation is that the material we have studied in low excitation objects has passed through a faster shock at earlier times .",
    "this may be a surprising result , but we can not see any way to avoid it .",
    "it is difficult to speculate about this process .",
    "what would be required is that the matter that enters the low excitation bow shock ( which we assume to be molecular cloud matter ) has previously gone through a high excitation bow shock ( in which the dust grains were destroyed ) .",
    "the simplest assumption would be that the previous high excitation bow shock was generated by the same source star that generates the low excitation hh outflow .",
    "this suggests that none of the five low excitation objects studied in this work correspond to the leading edge of the stellar outflow ( i.e. , all of them are produced some time after the onset of the jet ) .",
    "it is also interesting to note that we have assumed the molecular clouds in which these hh objects reside have approximately solar fe abundance ( in gas and dust phases ) .",
    "though this is a reasonable assumption , it may be possible that the abundances in present - day molecular clouds could differ from solar by a factor of a few .",
    "the entire range of fe abundances of the objects we have studied is from @xmath18 to 1.9 times solar . in light of this",
    ", one may argue that the dust grains are completely destroyed ( by passing through fast shocks ) in all 21 objects , and that the observed spread in fe abundance is due to different abundances in their parent molecular clouds . at present",
    ", our data can not resolve this issue ."
