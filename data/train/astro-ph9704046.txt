    "the nature of the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is still unclear .",
    "the most common point of view is that there is a supermassive black hole in the centre of active galaxy with mass approximately @xmath0  ( rees , 1984 ) .",
    "accretion on the black hole leads to the formation of powerful turbulent processes in accretion discs which effectively heat the plasma and generate magnetic field of the order of @xmath1 .",
    "ejection of plasma from discs with frozen magnetic field and emission lead to the formation of collimated streams which transfer energy to large distances , up to @xmath2 pc . besides , the processes of generation of electron  positron plasma may occur in the magnetospheres of the black holes as well as in the vicinity of accretion discs .",
    "particles are created in collisions of high  energy photons produced by inverse compton scattering of ultraviolet photons emitted from disk with fast particles accelerated by magnetic reconnection within disk or within magnetospheres of the rotating black hole , where equilibrium charge density changes its sign ( see , for example beskin , istomin  & pariev , 1992b ) .",
    "positron plasma forms pinched streams ( jets ) which have radii of the order of one parsec .",
    "the energy density of electromagnetic field in these jets greatly exceeds the energy density of electrons and positrons taking into account their rest energy .",
    "rotation of the black hole and the accretion disc is transmitted to the jet due to magnetic coupling , where strong radial electric field @xmath3 arises .",
    "drift in this field and in the longitudinal magnetic field @xmath4 frozen into plasma leads to differential rotation .",
    "electric current transferred by the jet produces azimuthal magnetic field @xmath5 , and magnetic field lines are twisted into spirals .",
    "energy in the jet is transferred by the pointing vector which is proportional to the product of radial electric field and azimuthal magnetic field . therefore , there is no problem of energy transfer along the jet on large distances as there is in the case when the main energy is in the hydrodynamic motion",
    ".    the most amazing facts of the jets from agn are their high collimation ( the ratio of the length to the diameter is a few orders of magnitude ) , stability and apparent superluminal velocities of distinct knots ( begelman , blandford & rees , 1984 ) .",
    "the hydrodynamic and mhd stability of jets was investigated in many works ( blandford & pringle , 1976 ; torricelli  ciamponi & petrini , 1990 ; appl , camenzind , 1992 ) . as to the stability of the electron  positron jets , rotating and moving with relativistic speed",
    ", it was shown in papers by istomin & pariev , 1994 and istomin & pariev , 1996 that they are stable with respect to axisymmetric as well as spiral perturbations .",
    "the physical reason for stability is the shear of the magnetic field , which in the case of small hydrodynamic pressure of plasma stabilizes small oscillations .",
    "perturbations do not increase with time ( im@xmath6 ) or have small damping decrement ( @xmath7 ) because of the resonance with alfvn waves @xmath8 . in electron ",
    "positron plasma , when the specific energy density and pressure are much less than the energy density of magnetic field , alfvn velocity is equal to the speed of light in vacuum @xmath9 ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the frequency and the wave vector in the plasma rest frame ) .",
    "resonance condition is fulfilled on the specific magnetic surface and , in the case of cylindrical jet , at the definite distance from the axis . in the vicinity of",
    "that surface magnetic and electric fields of the wave reach large magnitudes .",
    "the particles of the jet are accelerated by the electric field here , which leads to the absorption of the energy of perturbation .",
    "thus , the stability of the jet is connected directly with the production of energetic particles in the current .",
    "this resolves the problem of _ in situ _ acceleration of electrons and positrons producing synchrotron emission from knots observed along jets .",
    "in fact , as it is known ( see begelman at al . , 1984 ) , energetic particles accelerated in central region can not penetrate in the jet , they must loose their transverse momentum by synchrotron radiation already in the basement of the jet .",
    "characteristic time of synchrotron losses is given by @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the longitudinal lorentz  factor of the particle , @xmath14 ; @xmath15 is the classical radius of the electron @xmath16 ; @xmath17 is the electron cyclotron frequency . given @xmath18 ,",
    "@xmath19 radiation time @xmath20 is approximately @xmath21 whereas the typical time of the flyby through the region of strong fields @xmath22 .",
    "here @xmath23 is the diameter of the jet , @xmath24 .    in this paper",
    "we assume that the energy transferred along the jet , is mainly the electromagnetic energy which can be transmitted for long distances along the jets as along the wires . in this case",
    "it is very possible that part of that energy is in waves propagating along the jet , which are eigenmodes of cylindrical beam .",
    "the source of the wave motion is nonstationary processes in the magnetospheres of black hole and accretion disc .",
    "short time variability on scales from days to months is actually observed in agn  ( mushotzky , done & pound , 1993 ; witzel et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "such a picture also gives a natural explanation of the superluminal motions but requires neither special orientation of the jet nor relativistic jet with high speed ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "as it was shown in papers by istomin  & pariev , 1994 and istomin  & pariev , 1996 there exist so called standing modes among eigenmodes in jets ( @xmath26 ) which are not propagate with finite velocity along jet but are only subject to diffuse spreading and , therefore , their amplitude is maximal .",
    "phase velocity of these modes is greater than the speed of light .",
    "crests of the wave move along the jet with superluminal velocity causing acceleration of the particles on the alfvn surface .",
    "these regions can be the objects which are seen as bright knots with typical sizes of the order of the wavelength of the standing wave which is about the radius of the jet .",
    "the purpose of our paper is the consideration of the acceleration processes near the alfvn resonant surface , generation of the spectra of accelerated particles and calculation of the polarization of synchrotron radiation generated by these particles .",
    "the equations of motion near the alfvn surface are rather complicated .",
    "nevertheless , we can use drift equations  ( sivukhin , 1965 ) because the larmor radius of relativistic electrons and positrons @xmath27 ( if we take @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) is much less then radius of the jet and the width of resonant surface @xmath30 ( see expression ( 31 * ) ) .",

    "electromagnetic fields are equal to the sum of stationary fields ( without subscript ) and wave fields ( subscript 1 ) . for cylindrical jet",
    "the stationary configuration of fields is ( istomin & pariev , 1994 ) ( c=1 ) : @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 are cylindrical coordinates . in components @xmath40 @xmath41 here @xmath42 and @xmath43 are functions of @xmath44 , @xmath4 does not depend on @xmath44 . stationary electric field , which has an absolute value of @xmath45 , is not small compared to the magnetic field when @xmath46 ,",
    "therefore we must consider our equations in the frame moving with plasma where @xmath47 .",
    "there are a lot of such reference frames because there is an arbitrary parameter @xmath48 in the expression for the velocity of plasma which determines the radial profile of longitudinal velocity .",
    "@xmath49 is the velocity along the magnetic field which is not related to the rotation .",

    "we see that @xmath52 and @xmath77 have a logarithmic singularity at the alfvn point .",
    "later we adhere to our expansion over @xmath78 , assuming @xmath79 , @xmath80 whenever the quantities under consideration have no singularities at @xmath79 .",
    "let us calculate @xmath81 and @xmath82 in the first order by fields of the wave .",
    "remembering that @xmath83 in our reference frame and knowing that terms with the energy @xmath34 contain small parameter which is the ratio of the larmour radius to the jet radius or to the characteristic length of variations of zero order fields we can simplify drift equations as follows , @xmath84 @xmath85}{b^2 } \\eqno ( 8)\\ ] ] here subscript 0 denotes the zero order term and 1 denotes the first order term .",
    "the force of inertia is also present in the expression of @xmath86 ( see sivukhin , 1965 ) , but the term with inertia force contains the mass , has the same order as terms with energy and is omitted consequently .",
    "for @xmath87 we will also not take into account the inertia force because it is smaller than gradient terms such as @xmath88/ecb^4.$ ] when we substitute @xmath89 and @xmath90 into ( 8) we get @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the lorentz factor corresponding to the velocity of the moving frame .",

    "the natural boundary is the width of the acceleration region @xmath217 ( see expression  ( 31 * ) ) . because the main contribution to the integral  ( 31 * ) is from the region near the point @xmath254 the lower limit for power law @xmath255 is @xmath256 .",
    "we also found mean power law index for the distribution of particles between energies @xmath257 and @xmath258 .",
    "results are presented in fig .",
    "one remaining question in the formation of the spectrum of energetic particles is the origin [ origin]of the initial particles , since in the first order on perturbed fields there is no acceleration of the cold plasma in equations  ( 1 ) .",
    "we have already mentioned that initial particles to be accelerated are originated in the region close to the alfvn resonance .",
    "it can be seen from equations  ( 1 ) that in the second order on perturbed fields the acceleration always takes place and the power acquired corresponds to the term @xmath259 in the energy conservation equation for the electromagnetic field .",

    "the next most important modes are @xmath341 and @xmath342 .",
    "since no one quantity @xmath326 , @xmath343 or @xmath332 changes when  @xmath177 changes to  @xmath344 and @xmath42 to @xmath345 , it is enough to consider only @xmath341 and all values of @xmath42 . polarization @xmath332 versus @xmath346 for this case is plotted in fig .",
    "6 as well as observational points .",
    "we showed first non - axisymmetric fundamental mode @xmath341 which are expected to be excited more than higher modes with @xmath347 .",
    "polarization curves are plotted only for values of @xmath334 at which alfvn resonance @xmath79 is present inside the jet . as previously , @xmath348 and @xmath349 .",
    "it is seen that in the case of uniform particle distribution across the jet , curves for @xmath293 changing from @xmath350 to @xmath351 are located in the region where points from observations of bl  lac object ( crosses ) and quasars ( squares ) are situated .",
    "however , polarization curves for emitting particles concentrated on the alfvn resonance surface , as it is the case if our acceleration mechanism works , do not match observation of bl  lac objects .",
    "electric field vector is always oriented perpendicular to the jet axis .",
    "now let us make calculations closer to the reality taking into account doppler boosting and presence of strong electric field .",
    "we will denote values measured in the plasma rest frame as values with primes .",

    "therefore the degree of polarization is not changed . since for one",
    "particle stocks parameters are expressed through the radiation flux with two main directions of polarization @xmath362 and @xmath363 by the formulae @xmath364 , @xmath365 , @xmath366 then @xmath367 and @xmath368 are transformed as @xmath369 , @xmath370 .",
    "therefore the intensity @xmath371 @xmath372 where @xmath373 is an angle between momentum of the particle and the magnetic field vector , @xmath374 is the angle between the direction of radiation and the cone formed by rotating velocity vector , both measured in the frame comoving with the fluid element .",

    "the expressions for @xmath189 and @xmath300 are obtained in the same fashion .",

    "free approach constant @xmath43 determining the component of @xmath50 parallel to the magnetic field in the observer frame @xmath284 remains to be free .",
    "we choose it such that the velocity @xmath50 of plasma has the least possible absolute value for a given @xmath4 and @xmath399 .",
    "this choice is the same as in  ( 3 ) @xmath400 for the value of @xmath43 equals to the @xmath401 .",
    "it can be checked that under change of @xmath298 to @xmath402 the value of @xmath189 is not changed , and the sign of @xmath300 is reversed .",
    "thus , as a result of integration @xmath301 and either @xmath303 or @xmath305 as it is when we do not take into account doppler boosting and electric field .",
    "we performed numerical calculations according to  ( 50 ) and  ( 51 ) using  ( 48 ) and  ( 49 ) .",
    "as above we take @xmath403 , @xmath348 , @xmath404 .",
    "results for uniform particle distribution do not match observations . taking into account presence of the electric field and doppler boosting changes the polarization of synchrotron emission essentially .",
    "now only for small values of angle @xmath293 and high  @xmath334 apparent direction of the magnetic field as it is usually derived from polarization measurements ( just perpendicular to the electric vector in the polarized component of the radiation ) is transversal to the jet axis . for most of inclination angles  @xmath293 and angular velocities @xmath334 apparent magnetic field is longitudinal .",
    "one can also see from fig .  7 , where we plotted  @xmath332 versus  @xmath333 for @xmath405 , that our simulation does not match observational data .",
    "however , for @xmath406 we are able to reproduce observations well enough , if particles are distributed close to the alfvn surface and @xmath341 or @xmath342 . as for the case without doppler boosting effect and without taking account electric field , @xmath332 is not changed when one changes the sign of @xmath334 , but  @xmath332 is changed when one put @xmath407 instead of @xmath408 .",
    "let us list all transformations which do not change equations for radial modes  ( 5 ) or lead to complex conjugated equations for @xmath409 :    1 .",
    "@xmath410 , @xmath411 , @xmath412 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath410 , @xmath411 , @xmath413 ; 3 .",
    "@xmath414 , @xmath413 ; 4 .",
    "@xmath415 , @xmath416 ; 5 .",
    "@xmath417 .",
    "so , if one set of parameters satisfies equations  ( 5 ) than parameters with changed signs will also satisfy equations  ( 5 ) for the same  @xmath52 or for  @xmath409 .",
    "obviously , these substitutions are valid for @xmath326 and @xmath343 as well .",
    "the value of  @xmath69 also is not changed under transformations listed above .",
    "degree of polarization  @xmath332 is not influenced by changing sign of  @xmath4 as well as by changing sign of  @xmath334 .",
    "the crucial fact is that changing sign in relation @xmath418 leads to changing sign of @xmath419 , whilst all other four transformations change neither  @xmath332 nor they change  @xmath346 .",
    "therefore , in the sense of correlation between  @xmath332 and @xmath333 , which can be verified experimentally , all different cases are reduced to considering both signs in the relation @xmath418 , but we can restrict ourself to @xmath420 , @xmath421 and all @xmath334 for which @xmath69 is located inside the jet . using formulae  ( 48 ) , ( 49 ) , ( 50 ) and expressions ( 3 ) for @xmath422 and @xmath423 one can check that stocks parameters remain unchanged when one changes sign of @xmath5 and replace angle @xmath293 by @xmath424 . also , simultaneous changing of sign of @xmath346 and @xmath293 to @xmath424 leads to that @xmath333 is transformed into @xmath425 .",
    "therefore , dependences of @xmath332 on @xmath333 in the case @xmath406 can be obtained from same dependences in the case @xmath405 by reflection @xmath426 and relabelling each curve from @xmath293 to @xmath424 .",
    "we plotted degree of linear polarization  @xmath332 versus  @xmath333 for @xmath341 in figs .  7 and  8 for @xmath405 and @xmath406 correspondently .",
    "alfvn resonance exists for @xmath427 .",
    "therefore , along curves in figs .  7 and  8 the value of @xmath334 changes in this interval .",
    "we see that curves in fig",
    ".  7 do not match observational data for knots in jets , while those in fig .",
    "dependence on the power law index  @xmath428 of emitting particles is small .",
    "we plotted results for @xmath429 and @xmath430 which are maximum and minimum values of @xmath428 obtained in the process of the formation of the spectrum ( see section  3 ) .",
    "we can suggest the following explanation of the fact that knots in jets with @xmath407 are observed more often than in jets having the opposite winding of the magnetic field .",
    "if we look at the models of the formation of magnetically driven jets from accretion discs ( see , e.g.  pelletier  & pudritz , 1992 ) we will find that magnetic field lines are always bent in the direction opposite to the direction of disc rotation as soon as the velocity of the outflow is directed outwards from the disc plane .",
    "this means that in the jet approaching the observer @xmath406 , whilst in the jet receding from the observer @xmath405 .",
    "disturbances propagating along approaching jet should be brighter than those in the counter - jet due to the doppler boosting effect . therefore",
    ", we will observe knots in parts of jets having @xmath406 more often than in those with @xmath405 .",
    "this explains the fact that the number of sources having @xmath431 is approximately the same as the number of sources having @xmath432 despite that for most of the values of parameters calculations give longitudinal polarization @xmath432 .",
    "also the difference between jets in bl  lac objects and jets in quasars finds its explanation by systematically different values of  @xmath42 . in the frame of our model jets in bl  lac objects",
    "have higher value of  @xmath42 than jets in quasars .",
    "although we performed calculations only for one particular profile of @xmath433 which seems to be close to what one should obtain from theory of the formation of jets  ( istomin & pariev , 1996 ) we found this tendency and it should be general for profiles of @xmath433 which are qualitively similar to chosen one .",
    "there are many physical arguments though  ( istomin  & pariev , 1994 ; istomin  & pariev , 1996 ; beskin , istomin  & pariev , 1992a ) , why the real dependence @xmath433 should have qualitative properties similar to @xmath434 that we chose in our computations .",
    "in present work we considered possible acceleration of electrons and positrons inside relativistic rotating electron - positron force  free cylindrical jet with spiral magnetic field .",
    "it is very plausible that inner parsec  scale jets in active galaxies can be described in the frame of this physical model .",
    "the observations of jets in 3c273 and m87 points out that the extragalactic jets are most probably electron - positron rather than electron - proton ( morrison & sadun , 1992 ; reynolds et al . ,",
    "1996 ) also it seems to be very likely that such jets are not in steady state and contain waves excited by environmental processes , of which most powerful would be the variability of accretion rate onto central black hole and accretion disc instabilities both strongly perturbing magnetic field at the base of the jet .",
    "we considered the behaviour of such excitations inside cylindrical force  free jet in our previous works ( istomin & pariev , 1994 ; istomin & pariev , 1996 ) and found that in wide range of parameters determining the equilibrium structure of electromagnetic fields and perturbations inside the jet there exist resonant surfaces on which the phase speed of eigenmodes is equal to local alfvn velocity .",
    "those eigenmodes for which there is an alfvn resonance occured to have small damping decrement , whilst those having no alfvn resonances are neutrally stable .",
    "this fact points that existence of alfvn resonance leads to losses of energy of corresponding eigenmodes . in present work",
    "we found how particles are accelerated in the strong fields near the alfvn surface .",
    "acceleration process and synchrotron losses combined together form power law energy spectrum of ultra - relativistic electrons and positrons with index between 2 and 3 depending upon initial energy of injected particles .",
    "the power law spectrum goes up to the energy @xmath435 , where the sharp fall down occurs ( see figs .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath435 depends on the initial particle temperature @xmath229 as well as on the characteristic acceleration energy @xmath196(26 ) , @xmath436 .",
    "the quantity of @xmath229 evaluated from the equipartition condition in the acceleration region is equal to @xmath437  mev for the quantities of magnetic field and density @xmath438 and @xmath439 correspondingly . as to the quantity of @xmath196 , it is , in accordance with ( 26 ) , of the order of @xmath440 for the same value of @xmath441 , where @xmath442 is the dimensionless amplitude of the perturbation . for large perturbations ( @xmath443 ) @xmath196 reaches the values of the order of @xmath444mev .",
    "thus particles accelerated near alfvn resonance are in the energy range of @xmath445 .",
    "these particles emitt synchrotron radiation in the range of frequences approximately from @xmath446 to @xmath447 which covers the frequences of modern radio observations .    in order to obtain observable predictions of our theory of standing wave excitations inside jets",
    ", we computed synchrotron radiation emitted by accelerated particles .",
    "we considered two possibilities : 1 )  ultra - relativistic particles distributed uniformly across the jet , 2 )  ultra - relativistic particles concentrated close to the alfvn resonance surface .",
    "the latter distribution follows from our acceleration theory and we compared it with the former one which might be produced by other acceleration processes .",
    "we assumed uniform magnetic field in the jet , so the equilibrium configuration of the jet is determined only by the radial profile of angular rotational velocity @xmath433 of magnetic field lines .",
    "in our computations we also specified component of the velocity parallel to the magnetic field lines in a way to minimize the kinetic energy associated with the flow and took @xmath448 .",
    "the actual velocity is determined by the processes of jet formation which is poorly understood now , still such minimal velocity is physically favoured  ( novikov & frolov , 1986 ) .",
    "the prominent characteristic of synchrotron radiation is its polarization : degree of linear polarization and orientation of electric vector with respect to the jet axis .",
    "we calculated these quantities for the emission integrated over the jet cross section taking into account relativistic bulk spiral flow of plasma in the jet , which leads to the presence of electric field comparable by magnitude with the magnetic field , doppler boosting effect for the intensity of synchrotron radiation and swing of the polarization position angle .",
    "we want to stress that the last effect , which was first pointed out for the simpler case of uniform magnetic field parallel to the jet axis by blandford & knigl in 1979 , substantially modifies resulting degree of linear polarization from the whole jet . however , because of the axial symmetry of the problem , only two orientations of polarization position angle are possible : parallel or perpendicular with respect to the jet axis .",
    "observations of polarization of vlbi scale jets ( gabuzda et al . , 1994a ) also show bimodal distribution of the position angle : most of knots in bl  lac objects and quasars have polarization either close to the jet axis or perpendicular to it .",
    "we also calculated velocities of crests of standing eigenmodes and compared them with the observed proper motions of bright vlbi knots in jets .",
    "we were able to match observational data only for the case when emitting particles are concentrated close to the alfvn resonance surface and magnetic field lines are twisted in the direction opposite to the direction of rotation @xmath42 .",
    "the last fact can be understood by selection effect due to the doppler boosting which makes sources with jets approaching the observer more favourable observed than receding jets . comparing calculations with observations",
    "we can estimate angular rotational velocity of jets .",
    "we obtained that @xmath42 in bl  lac objects is intrinsically larger than in quasars which accounts for the difference in polarization properties of these two classes of objects ( gabuzda et al . , 1994a )",
    ": in bl  lac the magnetic field inferred from polarization position angle is oriented predominantly perpendicular to the jet axis , in quasars it is parallel to the jet axis .",
    "authors are grateful to gabuzda  d.c . for compiling observational data on polarization of quasars and helpful discussions of different observational issues .",
