    "scalar mesons are degrees of freedom of qcd ( quantum chromodynamics ) that possess quantum numbers @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the total spin , @xmath2 represents parity and @xmath3 is the charge conjugation .",
    "mesons that possess isospin @xmath4 are referred to as isoscalars .",
    "scalars with @xmath4 represent qcd degrees of freedom with some peculiar features : they are defined as carrying quantum numbers of vacuum but are identifiable as resonances ; as mesons , they should be of @xmath5 ( quarkonium ) structure but are too many to simply represent @xmath5 objects ; and they are strongly mixed with each other so that disentangling them is in the majority of cases a highly non - trival task . however , they are also of extreme importance for qcd since their vacuum expectation values represent the cause of the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry in qcd , and this `` higgs mechanism '' is in turn expected to generate goldstone bosons of qcd : pions , kaons and others .",
    "thus understanding isoscalar mesons is a fundamental question of qcd , and one that has by no means been closed after decades of research and debate .",
    "listings of the particle data group ( pdg ) cite the existence of five @xmath6 states in the energy region up to 1.8 gev : @xmath7 or @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite . let us review basic experimental data regarding these resonances .    * historically , debates regarding scalar mesons have been mostly focused on the @xmath7 resonance ( also known as @xmath8 ) .",
    "the latter is characterised by a decay width that is of the same magnitude as the resonance mass  according to pdg , it has a mass of ( 400 - 500 ) mev and a decay width of ( 400 - 700 ) mev .",
    "the existence of this state was suggested in linear sigma models long ago : the state was introduced theoretically as the putative chiral partner of the pion @xcite . since the pion is a well - established quarkonium state , then the chiral - partner state of the pion had to be of the same structure .",
    "additionally , the pion is a pseudo - goldstone bosone  its mass is the lowest in the meson spectrum .",
    "therefore , naive expectations were that ( _ i _ ) the chiral partner of the pion would be the lightest scalar state with @xmath4 , i.e. , the @xmath8 meson , and consequently ( _ ii _ ) that the @xmath8 meson was a @xmath5 state . however , currently it is by no means clear that @xmath8 is truly a @xmath5 state , implying that its interpretation as the chiral partner of the pion is in doubt .",
    "we will come back to this issue later in this manuscript . *",
    "first hints about the existence of the @xmath9 resonance were discovered in analyses of @xmath13 scattering data found to exhibit a rapid drop in the cross - section in the energy region between @xmath14 mev and @xmath15 mev ( i.e. , close to the @xmath16 threshold ) in saclay data on antiproton - proton @xcite and berkley data on pion - proton collisions @xcite .",
    "the most precise modern - data analyses result in pole mass and pole decay widths values in the close vicinity of the mentioned energy region ",
    "see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite where the pole mass was determined as @xmath17 mev and the pole decay width as @xmath18 mev . *",
    "the @xmath10 resonance is a broad enhancemenet in the @xmath19 , @xmath20 and , to a lesser extent , @xmath16 and @xmath21 channels in the energy region of approximately 1.3 gev .",
    "it is characterised by emergence of two peaks , respectively in the @xmath22 and @xmath20 decay channels @xcite , the disentaglement of which requires a simultaneous analysis of @xmath23 and @xmath24 scattering data . the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrates that the @xmath22 decay channel is dominant in the energy region up to 1.35 gev whereas the energy region thereafter is dominated by the opening of the @xmath25 threshold leading to a strong @xmath20 decay pattern .",
    "note that @xmath10 represents a single resonance despite possessing two peaks since a combined dispersive analysis of both @xmath22 and @xmath20 channels yields only one pole .",
    "historically , early hints of the @xmath10 existence were observed in @xmath26 collisions at cern in 1969 with a possible @xmath27 enhancement claimed at @xmath28 gev @xcite .",
    "current edition of the particle data group listings accumulates all available data on @xmath29 estimating an interval for , rather than stating exact values of , its mass and decay width : @xmath30-@xmath31 mev and @xmath32-@xmath33 mev @xcite . *",
    "the discovery of the @xmath34 resonance originated in search for the scalar glueball state .",
    "this resonance is found mostly in pion final states from nucleon - nucleon ( or antinucleon - nucleon ) and pion - nucleon scattering processes .",
    "if such processes produce four pions , then @xmath34 is reconstructed from @xmath27 final states in the @xmath35 channel and from @xmath36 final states in the @xmath35 or @xmath37 channels .",
    "the resonance is therefore at least partly reconstructed in channels containing a double pomeron exchange rendering the state a glueball candidate @xcite .",
    "the pdg cites a world - average mass @xmath38 mev and decay width @xmath39 mev @xcite . *",
    "the @xmath12 resonance is characterised by a predominant @xmath16 decay channel , marking a clear point of distinction between this resonance and the above mentioned ones .",
    "the earliest evidence for the @xmath40 resonance was obtained from the decay @xmath41 at the slac crystal ball detector from @xmath42 annihilation @xcite ; a resonance with a mass of @xmath43 mev , a decay width of @xmath44 mev and the charge conjugation @xmath45 was found ( the latter was because the resonance had been produced in a radiative @xmath46 decay but , interestingly , no final determination of the total spin and parity was possible from these first data ) .",
    "subsequent analyses , such as those in ref .",
    "@xcite , determined the resonance to be of @xmath47 nature .",
    "the pdg cites a world - average mass @xmath48 mev and a decay width @xmath49 mev @xcite .      assuming a @xmath50 structure for mesons ( where @xmath51 denotes a constituent quark ) it is possible to construct two @xmath52 states for three quark flavours ( up @xmath53 , down @xmath54 and strange @xmath55 ) once the approximate isospin symmetry in the nonstrange - quark sector is considered ( @xmath56 ) : @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the latter are per construction pure states .",
    "they can obviously mix by virtue of carrying the same quantum numbers ; the mixed states are expected to be those appearing in the physical spectrum .",
    "clearly , two pure states will produce the same number of mixed states  thus only two of the five previously discussed physical states can conceivably be described in this approach .",
    "hence the natural questions are    * where in the physical spectrum are isoscalar @xmath50 states located ?",
    "* what structure do the remaining states possess ?",
    "answers to these questions are complicated by the already mentioned fact that states with the same @xmath59 quantum numbers in general , and isoscalar mesons in particular , are expected to mix .",
    "thus an isoscalar ( or indeed any other ) meson need not necessarily be of @xmath5 structure  it can also possess admixtures ( or even be predominantly composed ) of tetraquark ( @xmath60 ) , glueball ( bound states of qcd gauge bosons  gluons ) or molecular ( e.g. , @xmath19 or @xmath16 ) contributions .",
    "for the cases of the above - stated isoscalar mesons we then note the following :    * as indicated above , the @xmath7 resonance is usually considered as the natural option for the chiral partner of the pion , implying that @xmath7 possesses the @xmath50 structure as suggested , e.g. , by ref .",
    "however , a @xmath61 scalar state possesses the intrinsic angular momentum @xmath62 as well as the relative spin of the quarks @xmath63 . for this reason one could also easily expect the scalar @xmath5 state to be in the region above @xmath64 gev",
    "this would imply that ( _ i _ ) isoscalars above 1 gev possess the @xmath5 structure and ( _ ii _ ) @xmath7 represents a tetraquark state or a @xmath19 bound state .",
    "for details on both statements see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . * as already discussed , the @xmath9 resonance is close to the kaon - kaon threshold rendering a structure analysis for this state rather difficult . the resonance may be interpreted as a quarkonium @xcite , as a @xmath65 state @xcite , as a @xmath16 bound state @xcite , as a glueball @xcite or even as an @xmath66 bound state @xcite . *",
    "the @xmath10 resonance appears to be a suitable candidate for a non - strange @xmath50 state @xcite or a dynamically generated state @xcite . *",
    "the @xmath11 resonance seems to represent a ( predominant ) glueball state @xcite although claims have also been made that , contrarily , @xmath12 is of predominantly glueball nature @xcite . alternatively , @xmath12 can also be interpreted as a predominantly @xmath67 state @xcite .",
    "hence the current state of knowledge allows us to only claim with certitude that all the above mentioned states mix @xcite ; some of them even overlap due to large decay widths @xcite .",
    "the situation is thus rather complicated  and it is enhanced even further by the possible existence of a sixth isoscalar state , located very proximal to the set of the already mentioned isoscalars : the @xmath68 resonance .",
    "the existence of the putative new @xmath68 resonance has been claimed by the bes ii collaboration in 2004 @xcite .",
    "the mass and decay width of the resonance were determined by the collaboration as @xmath69 and @xmath70 mev .",
    "the stated large decay width implies a strong overlap of this resonance with @xmath12 ; however , there is a clear point of distinction between the two resonances : @xmath12 is reconstructed predominantly in the kaon decay channels whereas @xmath68 is reconstructed predominantly in the pion decay channels .",
    "+ there are four basic production mechanisms for @xmath12 and @xmath68 via @xmath46 decays @xcite :    * ( _ i _ ) @xmath71 , * ( _ ii _ ) @xmath72 , * ( _ iii _ ) @xmath73 , * ( _ iv _ ) @xmath74 .",
    "reactions ( _ i _ ) and ( _ iii _ ) allow for reconstruction of @xmath40 @xcite whereas reactions ( _ ii _ ) and ( _ iv _ ) allow for reconstruction of @xmath75 . importantly , assuming @xmath40 and @xmath75 to be the same resonance leads to a contradiction : such a resonance would have to possess a pion - to - kaon - decay ratio of @xmath76 according to reactions ( _ i _ ) and ( _ ii _ ) and , simultaneously , the pion - to - kaon - decay ratio @xmath77 according to reactions ( _ iii _ ) and ( _ iv _ ) @xcite .",
    "there can be no one resonance with these simultaneous features ",
    "thus bes ii data suggest @xmath40 and @xmath75 to represent two distinct resonances .",
    "+ let us finally discuss the relevance of the deliberations in this paper for fair .",
    "the proposed panda experiments at fair will study interactions between antiprotons and fixed - target protons and nuclei in the momentum range of 1.5 - 15 gev .",
    "a stated goal of the panda collaboration is the exploration of light - hadron spectroscopy , including search for glueballs and multiquark states @xcite . in this regard",
    "i would like to suggest the following courses of action in the particular case of possible mixing scenarios in the scalar sector :    * any viable search for members of a glueball spectrum must include the ground state as otherwise the spectrum would be incomplete .",
    "the panda collaboration is in a unique position to greatly advance our search for glueballs since ( _ i _ ) the collaboration can build upon extensive experimental work performed in the last decades and ( _ ii _ ) the technical specifications of the panda detector allow for a search for glueballs with unprecedented accuracy in comparison with similar undertakings in the past .",
    "+ however , the glueball state will inevitably overlap with other states that possess the same quantum numbers ( and may be of @xmath5 , @xmath60 or molecular structure ) and the disentanglement of various signals from each of the mentioned resonances will represent a formidable task .",
    "+ * current theoretical results @xcite suggest the scalar glueball to be positioned at ( 1.5 - 1.7 ) gev , i.e. , in the vicinity of the established resonances @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 as well as the newly proposed @xmath68 state .",
    "consequently , a viable search for the scalar glueball will have to consider overlap of the glueball not only with @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 _ but also _ with @xmath68 . in other words : a viable search for the glueball ground state at panda must consider the possibility of the existence of @xmath68 .",
    "if @xmath68 is not found at panda , then bes results may be put in doubt ; but if @xmath68 is ascertained then its signal will have to be disentangled from the glueball signal in order for the glueball search to be successful , making the search even more challenging and thus even more interesting .",
    "scalar mesons represent an interesting challenge for the future panda experiments at fair : the planned search for the glueball state in the @xmath6 channel will have to consider mixing / overlap between non - strange @xmath5 , strange @xmath5 , non - strange and strange @xmath60 as well as possible molecular - type states . additionally , obtaining a clear signal for",
    "the glueball will inevitably require the confirmation ( or negation ) of the existence of a putative new isoscalar state referred to as @xmath68 by the bes ii collaboration @xcite .",
    "if @xmath68 exists , it will most certainly overlap with the glueball .",
    "thus a viable search for a glueball state simultaneously implies a search for @xmath68 : ignoring @xmath68 will strongly distort any signal for the glueball .",
    "for this reason , the search for a glueball at panda is more than a search for merely one state  it is a search where several very close - by states have to be considered simultaneously .",
