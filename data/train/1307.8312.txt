    "observational data indicate that our universe undergoes an accelerating phase since the recent past  @xcite .",
    "the cosmological constant could be considered as a candidate for the dark energy to explain the observational result in the @xmath0cdm model . however , this model has two problems of the fine tuning and the coincidence and thus , an alternative candidate was needed .",
    "one promising candidate is a dynamical dark energy model based on scalar field theory which is dubbed the quintessence  @xcite .",
    "this model has a canonical kinetic term and thus , a scalar is minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "we wish to point out that the cosmological constant has a constant equation of state @xmath1 , while the scalar field model has a time - dependent equation of state with @xmath2 .",
    "recently , planck observation  @xcite has shown four combined data on equation of state : i ) @xmath3 ( 95@xmath4 ; panck+wmap+bao ) which is in good agreement with a cosmological constant , ii ) @xmath5 ( 95@xmath4 ; panck+wmap+union2.1 ) that is more consistent with a cosmological constant , iii ) @xmath6 ( 95@xmath4 ; panck+wmap+snls ) which favors the phantom phase ( @xmath7 ) at the @xmath8 level , and iv ) @xmath9 ( 95@xmath4 ; panck+wmap+@xmath10 ) which is in tension with a cosmological constant at more than the @xmath8 level .",
    "the last two might draw the universe into a phantom phase about at the 2@xmath11 level .",
    "however , if one uses the bao data in addition to the cmb , there is no strong evidence for the phantom phase that is incompatible with a cosmological constant .    on the other hand ,",
    "one modified gravity named the galileon gravity was considered another model of the dynamical dark energy  @xcite .",
    "this model is also described by a scalar field theory which contains terms of nonlinear - derivative self couplings . turning off gravity , the galileon action is invariant under the galilean transformation of @xmath12 .",
    "the field equations contain at most second derivatives of @xmath13 , implying that it is surely free from the ostrogradsky ghosts . turning on gravity",
    ", however , breaks the symmetry .",
    "therefore , a covariant galilean action has been constructed  @xcite , where the galilean symmetry is softly broken but it preserves the shift symmetry of @xmath14 .",
    "its cosmological implications have been extensively investigated to explain the late - time acceleration in  @xcite .    in this work , we wish to investigate the late - time acceleration by using the linearly coupled cubic galileon model  @xcite together with a linear potential @xmath15 .",
    "this model is similar to the dgp model  @xcite .",
    "we note that adding the potential breaks the shift symmetry , which might make the nonlinear - derivative self coupling term trivial . in this case",
    ", one needs two equations of state parameter named the native and effective equations of state to say whether the universe is accelerating or not .",
    "this is because there is coupling between the cold dark matter and galileon . in the uncoupled case of @xmath16 , the model under consideration",
    "corresponds to the cubic galileon gravity .",
    "this has been studied in  @xcite , which shows that the data of sn+bao+@xmath10 prefers the galileon gravity over the quintessence .",
    "the authors in  @xcite have shown an appearance of the phantom phase , but it arose from choosing negative @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "more recently , it turned out that the equation of state obtained from the cubic galileon model is indistinguishable from @xmath19 of the cosmological constant  @xcite . for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , a phantom phase appeared for both @xmath16 case  @xcite and @xmath22  @xcite . for a quadratic coupling with @xmath20 and @xmath21 ,",
    "its late - time evolution was investigated in  @xcite which indicates a crossing of the phantom divide line .",
    "however , we mention that these phantom phases arose from when one chooses negative coefficients @xmath23 .",
    "previous works on the galilean models have shown phantom phases , depending on the choice of coefficients .",
    "hence , it is very curious to check if a phantom phase happens really in the galilean models because phantom behavior is quite interesting and it is possibly bad for the future evolution of the universe .",
    "hence , we hope to find a phantom phase in the linearly and quadratically coupled cubic galileon model that include linear potential .",
    "however , we have found no phantom phase when we did make a complete computation .",
    "we wish to understand why there is no phantom by comparing it with the brans - dicke theory with a linear potential .",
    "if one suppresses a nonlinear - derivative self coupling term of @xmath24 capturing a decisive feature of the galileon gravity , the linearly coupled cubic galileon model with the potential is similar to the brans - dicke cosmology with the power - law potential @xmath25 where one could observe a future crossing of the phantom divide line only for @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems that choosing the linear potential @xmath27 does not provide the phantom phase because this potential breaks the shift symmetry .",
    "explicitly , the addition of the linear potential did not make the nonlinear - derivative self coupling term of @xmath28 matter and thus , it did not play a role in the late - time evolution . very recently , a model of slotheon gravity with @xmath29 and @xmath30 has provided the cosmic acceleration but not the phantom phase in the late - time evolution  @xcite .    inspired by the above motivation , we will focus on observing whether the phantom phase appears in the future when we use the linearly and quadratically coupled cubic galileon models that include linear potentials .",
    "the covariant galileon action can be written as  @xcite @xmath31,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 are arbitrary dimensionless constants , and @xmath33 is the reduced planck mass , and @xmath34 to make the @xmath35 s dimensionless .",
    "@xmath36 denotes the lagrangian for the cold dark matter and @xmath37 ( its trace @xmath38 ) represent the energy - momentum tensor . the galileon action is usually classified into three classes : the uncoupled galileon with @xmath39 ; the linearly coupled galileon with @xmath22 and @xmath40 ; the derivative coupled galileon with @xmath16 and @xmath41 .",
    "we are working in the jordan frame where the explicit coupling between @xmath13 and @xmath38 is removed when we use a metric redefinition  @xcite . among three classes of the galileon model , we focus on the linearly coupled cubic galileon ( lcg ) model as  @xcite @xmath42,\\ ] ] where the linear potential of @xmath43 is introduced for our late - time evolution . here",
    "we demand that @xmath44 @xmath45 are positive to avoid the phantom scalar field .",
    "the case of @xmath16 corresponds to the cubic galileon gravity  @xcite .",
    "this model with @xmath46 was extensively studied in  @xcite and the uncoupled case of @xmath16 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 was investigated in  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the choice of @xmath47 , we use @xmath49 instead of @xmath18 which shows a decisive feature of the galileon gravity when we compare it with the quintessence and the brans - dicke cosmology .",

    "the term of @xmath137 showing a feature of the galileon gravity did not contribute significantly to deriving the late - time acceleration . to explain it ,",
    "let us compare our result with ref .",
    "@xcite where acceleration was found , even though the potential @xmath138 was not introduced .",
    "the reason seems to be clear because this potential breaks the shift symmetry of @xmath139 .",
    "the addition of the potential did not make the nonlinear - derivative self coupling term of @xmath28 matter and thus , it did not play a role in the late - time evolution .    at this stage ,",
    "one may ask which one is an observable quantity between @xmath140 and @xmath141 in the jordan frame  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the jordan frame is a physical frame because of a minimal coupling to matter .",
    "however , this frame gives rises to the non - conservation of continuity equation ( [ conserv - eq ] ) which shows that @xmath142 plays the role of a source to generate a new dark fluid . even though @xmath143 indicates a genuine equation of state for a galileon - fluid",
    ", it can not satisfy the continuity equation . on the other hand , although @xmath144 is not a genuine equation of state for a galileon - fluid ( because it contains cold dark matter ) , it satisfies the continuity equation .",
    "this implies that each of them is not a perfect observable for the linearly ( quadratically ) coupled galileon models .",
    "therefore , we have to use both @xmath141 and @xmath140 to show the presence of a crossing of the phantom divide .",
    "if the phantom phase is observed from both , one believes that it really happens in the evolution of the linearly ( quadratically ) coupled cubic galileon gravity models .",
    "otherwise , one is hard to confirm the appearance of the phantom phase in the jordan frame .",
    "surely , our analysis shows the disappearance of any phantom phase in the coupled cubic galileon models .",
