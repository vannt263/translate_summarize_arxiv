    "recently , ozsvth and szab have introduced several floer homology constructions , assigning invariants to @xmath3-manifolds and more recently to knots , links and contact structures on @xmath4-manifolds ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "+ the common flavor of these constructions is assigning a surface @xmath5 of genus @xmath6 and two sets of disjoint , homologically independent circles @xmath7 on @xmath5 together with some marked points in the different regions of @xmath8 to the object in hand , which may be the @xmath4-manifold , the knot or the contact structure .",
    "then they consider the lagrangian floer homology associated with the submanifolds @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the symmetric product :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the symmetric group on @xmath6 letters .",
    "the associated floer homologies are then proved to be independent of the various choices made meanwhile .",
    "+ in particular the knot floer homology , called the heegaard floer homology of knots by ozsvth and szab , is easy to compute at least up to the level of chain complexes .",
    "in fact , given a knot projection diagram , one can fix a marked point on the knot diagram and consider the associated kauffman states ( see @xcite for definitions ) of the knot projection .",
    "these kauffman states will be unions of marked points , one in each of the regions formed by the knot projection ( except for the neighbors of the marked point on the knot ) .",
    "the marked points are put close to the self intersections of the diagram of knot projection .",
    "we assume for each self intersection that exactly one of the @xmath13 neighboring regions has its marked point close to the chosen intersection .",
    "the chain complex will be freely generated by these kauffman states .",
    "+ in the standard knot theory , one will assign two types of gradings to each kauffman state , which ozsvth and szab call the maslov and spin grading respectively , because of the relation to the @xmath4-manifold invariants and the notation used there ( @xcite ) .",
    "these can be read off easily ( combinatorially ) from the diagram .",
    "the boundary maps will respect the spin grading and will lower the maslov grading by one .",
    "so there will be a double grading imposed on the floer homology groups .",
    "we will denote by @xmath14 the heegaard floer homology of the knot @xmath15 in the spin grading @xmath16 and by @xmath17_m$ ] the part of these homology groups in bi - grade @xmath18 , where @xmath19 denote the maslov and spin gradings , respectively .",
    "+ computation of the boundary maps is harder though .",
    "by thickening the knot projection , one will get a surface .",
    "associated with the domains in the knot projection , the @xmath20-curves are drawn on this surface .",
    "the @xmath21-circles will be associated with the self intersections and one special @xmath21-circle will be assigned to the marked point .",
    "the counts for the boundary operator will reduce to deciding for certain combinations @xmath22 of the regions @xmath23 of @xmath8 , that how many holomorphic maps @xmath24 have a domain equal to @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 denotes the unit disk ( see @xcite for the full description ) .",
    "+ in general certain domains are discovered to support holomorphic disks and their contributions to the boundary operators have been computed .",
    "a class of them is illustrated in * figure.7*. there are also long exact sequences assigned to a triple @xmath27 where @xmath28 is obtained by changing a positive intersection in a projection diagram of @xmath29 to a negative one , and @xmath30 is obtained by resolving this intersection so that the orientations are preserved in different pieces of the resulting link .",
    "this exact sequence may be used to get information on the contribution of the topological disks to the boundary operator or help to compute the homology in some cases .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the precise statement , since we will not be using this exact sequence . + using these exact sequences and the information about the holomorphic representatives of certain domains , several computations have been done ( c.f .",
    "it turned out that the heegaard floer homology is completely determined knowing the symmetrized alexander polynomial @xmath31 of an alternating knot @xmath15 , together with the signature @xmath32 . moreover",
    "the homology is supported on a line in the @xmath33-plane .",
    "there are also computations for the torus knots and the @xmath34-pretzel knots ( @xmath35 ) and some partial but very useful information on the fibered knots .",
    "+ in this paper we deal with the remaining three stranded pretzel knots .",
    "note that the only remaining cases are the @xmath0 and @xmath36 for @xmath2 .",
    "the rest of them are either the mirrors of these , or lie in the category of previous computations .",

    "we remind the reader that a @xmath37-pretzel knot is a knot obtained from 3 pairs of strands which are twisted @xmath54 and @xmath55 times respectively and then the ends are glued together cyclically as is shown in * figure.1 * ( also see @xcite ) . + we will only discuss the proof in the @xmath0 case with @xmath50 .",
    "the other cases are completely similar . + in order to do the computations , first one should fix a pointed heegard diagram of the knot .",
    "the diagram that we will be using is the standard one , obtained from the plane projection of the pretzel knot .",
    "namely , we thicken the projection of the @xmath0-pretzel knot to obtain a genus @xmath56 surface .",
    "+ then the @xmath20-circles correspond to different finite regions in the knot projection .",
    "they go around the `` whole '' corresponding to these regions in the thickened knot once .",
    "the @xmath21-circles correspond to the intersection points in the knot projection and cut all of the @xmath20-circles that are associated with the neighboring areas of the intersection , once .",
    "* figure.2 * shows the construction for the trefoil knot .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a careful description of this heegaard diagram for arbitrary knots .",
    "+    there is a special choice for an additional ( exceptional ) @xmath21-curve which will go around one of the handles in the knot projection .",
    "this is in correspondence with a choice of a marked point somewhere `` on '' one of the arcs of the knot projection .",
    "here we are assuming that one of the two neighboring regions of this arc in the knot projection is the unbounded region .",
    "the floer homology is independent of the choice of this point .",
    "we will choose two different points , as suggested in parts ( a ) and ( b ) of * figure.1 * and will study the homology groups formed out of the associated chain complexes of these two diagrams .",
    "a comparison of the boundary maps in the two complexes will give us the result .",
    "+ below we describe the intersection points of @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( the associated tori of the @xmath21 and @xmath20 circles in the symmetric product of the surface ) .",
    "these are in correspondence with the kauffman states of the knot , as described in @xcite .",
    "+ a kauffman state is a union of @xmath59 marked points ( with @xmath6 the number of @xmath60 curves ) in the diagram of the knot projection .",
    "each of the finite regions will get a marked point except for the neighboring region of the special point on the knot .",
    "the marked points are put close to the self intersections in the knot projection , i.e. in one of the four quadrants .",
    "we require that for each self intersection , exactly one of the @xmath13 quadrants gets a marked point . + in * figure.1 * we have marked two of the regions by the letters a and b. in both cases ( a ) and ( b ) , any kauffman state will have a marked point in region a and one in region b. + in our knot projection , there are three pairs of strands twisted @xmath61 and @xmath62 times respectively and then the ends are cyclically glued back together .",
    "let us call these pairs `` 1 '' , `` 2 '' and `` 3 '' respectively .",
    "there are several intersections in the knot projection associated with each of these pairs which we may number from top to the bottom in the picture , starting as @xmath63 .",
    "so we will be denoting the @xmath64 intersection from the top on the second pair of strands by @xmath65 $ ] , etc . .",
    "+ with this notation fixed , there are three possibilities for the marked points in regions a , b : +   + ( 1 ) the marked point in `` a '' is located next to an intersection on the second pair of strands , say @xmath66 $ ] , and the marked point on `` b '' is next to @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "+ ( 2 ) `` a '' has a marked point next to @xmath68 $ ] and `` b '' has one next to @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "+ ( 3 ) the marked point on `` a '' is next to @xmath68 $ ] and that of `` b '' is next to @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "+ note that @xmath69 . + it is important to note that in both cases ( a ) and ( b ) , the position of the marked points in the regions `` a '' and `` b '' determines the kauffman state completely",
    ". we will call the state described in ( 1 ) , @xmath70 or @xmath71 depending on whether we are considering the case with the marked point as in * figure 1(a ) * or the case shown in * figure 1(b)*. similarly from the description ( 2 ) above we will get @xmath72 and from ( 3 ) will get @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( see * figure.3 * ) . note that @xmath75 and @xmath76 are special and somehow different from what is shown in",
    "* figure.3*.    if a statement is true for both @xmath70 and @xmath71 we will simply state it for @xmath77 , etc .. +    we now turn to compute the maslov grading and the spin grading of these states .",
    "it is easy to see that all of the intersection points of the knot projection are positive intersections and using the local contributions to maslov and spin grading ( as is shown in * figure.5 * ) we may compute them as follows ( we will write @xmath78 for @xmath79 $ ] ) :    @xmath80     + @xmath81 + for an intersection point ( or equivalently kauffman state ) * x * , define @xmath82 .",
    "then from the above table , we see immediately that @xmath83 , while @xmath84 . on the other hand , for two kauffman states * x ,",
    "y * , we know that * y * may appear in the boundary of * x * only if @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "if so , we will definitely have @xmath87 . as a result the only boundary maps will go from @xmath77 s to @xmath88 s and @xmath89 s .",
    "with the above computation in hand , the next step is to compute the coefficients of different regions in the associated domain of the topological disks between the relevant kauffman states .",
    "we will use the knot projections with pairs of integers on the edges , to denote the domain with these pairs as the coefficients on the upper face and lower face of the corresponding handle of that edge ( arc ) . for a more careful description of these notations",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "+ there are three arcs on the top of our diagram of the knot projection which connect the ends of the pairs of strands to each other cyclically .",
    "correspondingly , there are two regions associated to each of these arcs , one on the upper face of the surface and one on the lower face .",
    "we will compute all the possible topological disks between @xmath90-type and @xmath91-type kauffman states with the property that their coefficient on the lower face of the surface on these three arcs is zero .",
    "it is easy to see that the only possible disks of maslov index @xmath92 between @xmath77 s and @xmath93 s in both cases are the ones going from @xmath94 to @xmath95 and the one going from @xmath96 to @xmath97 .",
    "this means that any other disk either has a negative coefficient in the region associated to the `` top arcs '' , or it has at least one strictly positive coefficient in one of the punctured ones .",
    "+ we also note here that in case ( b ) , the intersection points @xmath98 and @xmath74 live in different spin gradings , except for one case .",
    "in fact , if @xmath99 then : @xmath100 or putting it in other form , it says that : @xmath101 this can be the case only if @xmath102 and @xmath103 are respectively odd and even . in this case",
    "the spin grading will be @xmath104 .",
    "so for any spin grading @xmath105 , the disks described by the above domains ( i.e. between @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) are the only disks with the described property that are relevant to the boundary map",
    ". we will be interested in computing the number of holomorphic disks whose associated domain is as above .",
    "+ fix a spin grading @xmath106 . then @xmath107 iff @xmath108 .",
    "these are @xmath109 .",
    "correspondingly we will have the b - type kauffman states @xmath110 .",
    "the disk between @xmath111 and @xmath112 will be as is shown in * figure.6 * , where @xmath113",
    ". we will denote such a domain by @xmath114 .",
    "+    * lemma.1 . * _ if @xmath115 is the disk associated to @xmath114 and @xmath116 is the moduli space of holomorphic representatives of the disk @xmath115 , then : @xmath117 _ + * proof . * in the heegaard diagram which we made by thickening the knot projection , change the place of the exceptional curve to the point marked by the solid square in * figure.6*. puncture all of the regions which are not shown in the picture .",
    "standard arguments , as those used by ozsvth and szab for defining the @xmath4-manifold and knot floer homologies show that still we will have a floer homology , meaning that there is a boundary operator @xmath118 with the property that @xmath119 ( one may connect the ends cyclically to get a link /knot diagram and puncture all of the non - relevant domains .",
    "then put the special @xmath21-curve at the point marked by a solid square in the picture and use the results of ozsvth and szab . ) .",
    "+ the two kauffman states which are shown in the picture , may be extended to kauffman states of this diagram , which we will call * x , y * , with @xmath85 and @xmath86 . in the same picture",
    "we may consider the two kauffman states which correspond to @xmath120 and call them * x@xmath121,y@xmath121 * with the maslov index of * x@xmath121 * higher than that of * y@xmath121*. note that @xmath122 and that the domain associated to the topological disk connecting these two kauffman states is a square , with a circle removed as shown in * figure.7*. the @xmath21-circles are shown by solid lines while the @xmath20-circles are the dashed lines .",
    "it is not hard to see that this domain is associated to a disk , supporting a unique holomorphic representative , as is shown in @xcite .",
    "so by allowing the disks which do not preserve the spin - grading , we will get * * x**@xmath121 in the boundary of * x * with coefficient @xmath123 .",
    "a similar argument shows that * * y**@xmath121 appears in the boundary of * y * with coefficient @xmath123 . +    on the other hand , note that @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the part of boundary of * x * whose spin grading is equal to that of * x * minus @xmath126 . since @xmath127 the coefficient of * * y**@xmath121 in this expression , denoted by @xmath128 is also @xmath129 .",
    "consequently the above coefficient in @xmath130 is zero , since the boundary operator does not increase the spin grading .",
    "it is easy to see that the only relevant kauffman states to @xmath131 and @xmath132 are respectively * * y , x**@xmath121 . let @xmath133 .",
    "then @xmath134 this completes the proof of the lemma.@xmath135 +",
    "our goal is to prove the following theorem from which we will deduce our claim about the homology of pretzel knots : + * theorem.3 . * _ with the above notation , the contribution of the domain @xmath114 to the boundary map is @xmath123 . saying it differently : @xmath136 _ + fist of all note that this theorem implies that the pairs of kauffman states of type ( b ) in the spin gradings @xmath137 are canceled against each other .",
    "this means that if there are @xmath138 kauffman states of type @xmath90 ( i.e @xmath71 ) , and @xmath139 of type @xmath140 , then there will be a group @xmath141 of maslov index @xmath142 or a group @xmath143 of maslov index @xmath144 if @xmath145 or @xmath146 respectively .",
    "this determines the groups for @xmath16 in the above range .",
    "we will comment on the case @xmath147 later .",
    "+    * proof of theorem.3 .",
    "* let us put @xmath148 for the statement that the domain @xmath114 supports a unique ( up to reparametrization ) holomorphic disk . lemma.1",
    "says that it does not matter which @xmath149 we are considering and in particular we may restrict ourselves to the case @xmath150 .",
    "we will show @xmath148 by induction on @xmath151 . for @xmath152 ,",
    "this is our rectangle , and there is nothing to prove .",
    "now suppose that @xmath153 are true .",
    "consider the spin - grade @xmath106 in the type ( a ) heegaard diagram .",

    "there is a disk between @xmath158 and @xmath157 , which is of the form described in * figure.7(b)*. in fact it will be an @xmath159-gon with @xmath160 holes .",
    "the disks of the type shown in * figure.7 * are easily seen to have a unique holomorphic representative ( this may be done by considering ( -2,3,2a+1)-pretzel knots , where the computation may be done with an indirect approach , at least for the @xmath159-gon ) .",
    "although it uses two of the regions on the top , these are on the upper face of the surface , while for the above discussions , we only punctured the lower faces in order to get rid of the rest of the disks . as a result , we may assume that @xmath158 and @xmath157 are canceled against each other .",
    "the disks between the pairs @xmath161 are of the form @xmath162 for some number @xmath149 and @xmath163 , so from the induction hypothesis , we know that these pairs may also be assumed to cancel each other . if we have been careful to choose @xmath164 such that @xmath165 or @xmath166 ( note that for the proof of this theorem we are free to change our numbers @xmath167 ) then all of the b - type kauffman states will be canceled and the homology groups will be completely supported in degree @xmath168 .",

    "we will prove the theorem by a direct argument .",
    "the proof will be very similar to that of * lemma.1*. we will fix a reference point as shown by a bold square in * figure.8 * and consider the relevant floer homology , allowing the disks that change spin - grading .",
    "again we may introduce two new kauffman states * w , z * , which agree with our white and bold states respectively , in all but two intersections , where the difference is illustrated in * figure.8*. for convenience we will call the white and bold state * y , x * respectively . @xmath176 and again there are disks with unique holomorphic representatives going from * w * to * y * and from * z * to * x*. by considering the coefficient of * y * in @xmath177 we see that : @xmath178 but the disk between * z * and * w * is of type @xmath179 and we are done by the induction hypothesis .",
    "note that it is important here that @xmath172 is even and the same argument will not work for odd @xmath172 .",
