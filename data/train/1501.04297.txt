    "in this chapter , the background and the objective of the present thesis are described .",
    "the first section focuses on the electronic structures of physisorption systems , photon stimulated process on the solid surfaces , the post - desorption collisions and the introduction of the nuclear resonant scattering ( nrs ) . in the second section ,",
    "the three objectives of the present study are presented .      in this section ,",
    "the several backgrounds of the present studies are described .",
    "first , the modifications of electronic structure of rare gas atoms as a result of physisorption are presented based on the previous studies . besides , the experimental methods for the investigation of electronic structures of physisorption systems is discussed .",
    "the following subsection focuses on the photon stimulated desorption ( psd ) of rare gas atoms from solid surfaces .",
    "the capability of psd as a probe for the unoccupied electronic states are discussed .",
    "the effects of the post - desorption collisions on the laser desorption experiments are also discussed . in the last subsection",
    ", nrs is introduced as a unconventional type of mssbauer spectroscopy making use of the synchrotron radiation .",
    "the use of nrs to probe the modification of the electronic structure of physisorbed atoms due to the electric field gradient at the solid surface is discussed .    ]",
    "although noble gas atoms are not bound to solid surfaces by forming a chemical bond , they are weakly bound to the surfaces through van der waals interactions , which is called physisorption .",
    "van der waals force possesses its roots in the second - order perturbation energy of the coulomb interactions between neutral atoms @xcite . the attractive potential due to van der waals force between the two neutral atoms decays with @xmath6 , where the two atoms are sufficiently separated in distance compared with the bohr radius .",
    "on the other hand , the attractive potential due to the van der waals interaction between an atom and a metal surface decays with @xmath7 .",
    "this is because in the case of atom - surface system the attraction arise from the interaction between an induced dipole and an image dipole , whereas in the case of two neutral atoms two induced dipoles are in play @xcite .",
    "when the atom gets very close to the surface , it is repelled due to the pauli repulsion which exponentially increases with decreasing the separation .",
    "therefore , in the physisorption regime , the potential minima appears at some distance from the surface , which is typically at around 3 @xmath8 4   for most of the species .",
    "physisorption occurs with a weak interaction with the typical values of 30 to 300 mev for the depth of the potential well .",
    "therefore , it has been believed that the electronic structure of the physisorbed species is not significantly modified compared with their electronic structures in the gas phase .",
    "the estimation of the interaction energy and the electronic structure with calculations have suffered from the poor accuracy which is comparable to the interaction energies themselves , so far . actually , it has been speculated that the rare gas atoms adsorbed on a hollow sites on closed packed surfaces because it is most highly coordinated .",
    "however , it has been recently found by several experiments @xcite and ab - initio calculations that xe atoms adsorb on the atop sites on most metal surfaces @xcite .",
    "physisorbed rare gas atoms are simplest amongst the physisorbed species that includes not only various inert gas molecules but also the complex organic molecules .",
    "the binding energy of physisrbed atoms is in the order of a few 10 mev to 100 mev .",
    "the equilibrium distance of the physisorbed atom from the substrate varies from 3 to 5   @xcite . generally speaking ,",
    "the interactions between physisorbed atoms and the substrate is small compared to the interactions of the ones who form chemical bonds to the substrate , which is called chemisorbed species .",
    "nevertheless , several studies have shown the trends otherwise .",
    "although van der waals interactions are weak , the electronic states of xe atom were found to appreciably modified as a result of physisorption on metal surfaces by a photoemission spectroscopy @xcite and a resonant photoemission study @xcite .",
    "figure [ xept ] shows a schematic adiabatic potential for the physisorption system of monolayer xe on pt(111 ) , which has been clarified by the resonant photoemission study @xcite . the ionization potential and the first excitation energy of a free xe atom is known to lie 12.2 ev below the vacuum level and 8.4 ev , respectively . on the pt(111 ) surface , the ionization potential was shown to relaxed to be 9.3 ev below the vacuum level whereas the excitation energy was almost the same as that of a free xe .",
    "the relaxation was assumed to occur mainly due to the image charge screening .",
    "although the modification of the occupied electronic states has been investigated on physisorption systems , the unoccupied states represented by electron affinities have not been well investigated so far .",
    "similar to the case of the electronic states of physisorbed atoms , that of the substrate are also reported to be modified .",
    "the work function of the substrate were known to greatly reduced as a result of physisorbed layer of rare gas atoms @xcite .",
    "the reduction of the work function is intuitively explained by either one of the following context .",
    "( 1 ) the charge transfer from the substrate to the physisrobed atoms form an inverse dipole with regard to the surface dipole which is theoretically supported by ref .",
    "( 2 ) the push back effect is in play where the physisrobed atom push back the extended substrate electrons back into the bulk , which is theoretically supported by ref .",
    "@xcite . at this moment , the latter idea is widely accepted because it was supported by the report that the chemical shift of the physisorbed rare gas atoms was negligibly small with x ray photoemission experiments .",
    "the direct observation of the push back effect , however , is not presented so far .",
    "silva and coworkers suggested that in the push back regime not only the substrate but also the physisorbed rare gas atoms are largely polarized after the physisorption @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the polarization or some kind of modification of the electronic structure of rare gas atoms are observed as a confirmation of the physisorption induced modification of the electronic structure of atoms and the substrates .",
    "there are several ways to detect such electronic properties of physisorbed rare gas atoms .",
    "one of the ways to detect the electronic properties of the physisorbed atom is to follow the photo - induced motion of the atom , for the atomic motion is determined by the electronic structure specific to the atom .",
    "another way is observation of the hyperfine splitting of the nucleus of the physisorbed atom due to the strong electric field gradient at the surface as a probe of electronic structure .",
    "both ways are explored in this thesis .",
    "photo - stimulated processes at solid surfaces have been a topic of extensive studies because they allow us to control adsorbates in either thermal or nonthermal ways @xcite .",
    "laser - induced thermal desorption ( litd ) was investigated in detail for the systems of co / fe(110 ) ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) and xe / cu @xcite , and has been successfully applied to the studies of surface diffusion combined with low - energy electron microscopy @xcite or with scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite .",
    "nonthermal photostimulated phenomena , on the other hand , provide us with pathways that are nonaccessible in a thermal process .",
    "the nonthermal photostimulated desorption ( psd ) of rare gas atoms from metal surfaces has been investigated using photons of two energy regions : at @xmath9 7 ev , the excitonic or ionic excitation of the mono and multi - layers of ar and kr induces desorption @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ feulner ] , while infrared light at @xmath10 1 ev causes the direct excitation of the vibrational mode in the physisorption well to a continuum state @xcite .    ]",
    "the non - thermal psd of xe / metal using 1@xmath117 ev photons has been considered not to occur .",
    "generally , the mechanism of nonthermal psd using photons of 1@xmath117 ev is understood in terms of formation of the transient negative ion ( tni ) @xcite and the antoniewicz model @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ ant00 ] , where a substrate conduction electron is photoexcited to the adsorbate affinity level .",
    "the ground state xe in the gas phase does not bind an electron stably @xcite , which has been confirmed both theoretically and experimentally with the exception of ref .",
    "xe atoms physisorb on a metal surface .",
    "physisorption is assumed to occur with little influence on the electronic states .",
    "hence , it has been anticipated that the psd of xe / metal via tni is absent .",
    "condensed xe , however , has been reported to have modified electronic states compared with the isolated ones due to hybridization with the orbitals of neighboring atoms .",
    "it is known that it takes 0.5 ev to remove an excess electron from the bulk xe @xcite , and also that the ground state xe@xmath12 clusters with @xmath13 stably bind an electron @xcite , indicating that the electron affinity level of xe is shifted downward or broadened depending on the phase of xe . in this sense ,",
    "adsorption of xe onto metal surfaces may well result in a shift and/or broadening or even narrowing of its affinity level by hybridization of the unoccupied orbitals with the substrate electronic states , as is predicted by theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "laser induced desorption of atoms and molecules from solid surfaces is a vital phenomenon to investigate fundamentals such as surface electronic structures and dynamics @xcite . besides , laser desorption is an essential technique for pulsed laser deposition used in thin film growth @xcite and mass spectrometry of protein employing matrix - assisted laser desorption ionization @xcite .",
    "when desorption flux is small , the velocity distribution of desorbed atoms is directly governed by the desorption mechanism .",
    "when the desorption flux is large enough , on the other hand , the post - desorption collision between desorbed particles may become significant and modify the velocity distribution in the vicinity of the surface after the desorption .",
    "manifestations of the collision effect in laser induced desorption have been reported both by experiments and simulations as the modifications of the angular and velocity distribution of desorbing atoms and molecules @xcite .",
    "_ investigated the angular dependence of the translational temperature of d@xmath5 desorbed from tungsten surfaces under a pulsed laser irradiation @xcite .",
    "the translational temperature of d@xmath5 desorbed in the surface normal direction was higher than those in oblique directions .",
    "they attributed the variation of the translational temperature to the collision effect .",
    "_ used the direct monte carlo simulation of desorbing atoms to investigate the collision effect .",
    "they showed that even in the sub - monolayer regime the collision noticeably modifies the final angular , velocity and rotational - energy distributions @xcite .",
    "however , there has not been any model that can quantitatively estimate the degree of modification by the post - desorption collision in laser desorption so far .",
    "knudsen layer formation theory has been developed in rarefied gas dynamics to model the steady flow of the strong evaporation from the surface @xcite .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ kl ] , the initial velocity distribution of thermally desorbed species at the surface is well described by a ",
    "half - range  maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution @xcite . in the knudsen layer theory , as a result of intensive post - desorption collisions , the half - range velocity distribution at the surface is thermally equilibrated to a full - range maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution with a stream velocity at some distance from the surface . this thermalization layer is defined as the knudsen layer .",
    "the theory analytically predicts for monoatomic gas that the ratio of the translational temperature at the end of knudsen layer @xmath14 to the surface temperature @xmath15 and the mach number of the desorption flow at the end of the knudsen layer become 0.65 and 1.0 , respectively @xcite .",
    "( surface normal ) direction at the surface and at the end of the knudsen layer.[kl ] ]    kelly and dreyfus discussed that the knudsen layer formation theory may be applicable to the pulsed desorption flow with a large desorption flux .",
    "however , it is not straightforward because the pulsed desorption involves complex time evolution of the density and velocity distributions of desorbed atoms @xcite .",
    "sibold and urbassek have shown by means of the monte carlo simulation of the boltzmann equation that the pulsed desorption flow at an intense flux is well characterized by the above values predicted by the knudsen layer formation theory .",
    "although previous experimental studies recognized the collision effect in laser desorption @xcite , the formation of the knudsen layer in laser desorption has been discussed only by theory and simulations @xcite .",
    "so far , any experimental confirmation of knudsen layer formation in laser desorption has not been presented . for an experimental verification of the theory ,",
    "a systematic observation of the translational temperature and stream velocity of the desorption flow as a function of the desorption flux is strongly required .      with analogy to the absorption of visible light by atoms or infrared light by molecular vibrations ,",
    "the absorption of high energy x ray by nucleus was considered in 1930s .",
    "however , they were not easily observed due to the sharp resonance width ( @xmath8 nev ) of the nucleus and the relatively large recoil energy at the moment of photon absorption and emission .",
    "if one consider a @xmath16 ray emission at @xmath17 from a radio isotope and the recoil energy @xmath18 due to the conservation of the momentum of the system , the resultant photon energy @xmath19 observed from the center of mass system is @xmath20 with this relation , the shift of the energy of the @xmath16 ray is described .",
    "experimentally , one want to observe the absorption of the emitted @xmath16 ray by the sample . if the loss of the photon energy due to the second term of the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ moss ] ) is small compared to the resonance width of the nucleus , the resonant absorption of the @xmath16 ray should be observed .",
    "unfortunately , based on the conservation of the momentum the recoil energy can be expressed as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are mass of the nucleus and the speed of light .",
    "@xmath18 is proportional to the square of @xmath24 . if one substitutes @xmath22 and @xmath24 of eq .",
    "( [ recoil ] ) with the mass of @xmath25fe and 14.4 kev , one gets @xmath26 mev .",
    "the resonance width of @xmath25fe is 5.0 nev .",
    "therefore , with @xmath16 ray emission with a recoil of the atom , the resonant absorption of the @xmath16 is not observed because the resonance is not obtained , whereas the resonant absorption of visible or infrared light can be observed because their recoil energy @xmath18 is sub nano ev and in a order of pico ev , respectively .",
    "it had been speculated that with the thermal energy , the lost energy can be compensated . in this way , the absorption of @xmath16 ray at high temperature was actually observed .",
    "this method is based on the doppler effect due to the thermal energy .",
    "this indicates that with a higher temperature one can observe a @xmath16 ray adsorption with a better efficiency .",
    "nevertheless , mssbauer found that the efficiency of the resonant @xmath16 ray absorption by @xmath27ir is greatly increased by decreasing the temperature of the sample and @xmath16 ray source @xcite .",
    "it was readily confirmed by other groups @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon was explained by mssbauer with a recoilless emission and absorption of @xmath16 ray with a recoilless fraction or a lamb - mssbauer factor @xmath28 . in a solid",
    ", atoms are bound at a lattice site .",
    "the vibrational energy is quantized in a unit of @xmath29 . in order for the total energy to be conserved",
    ", it holds that @xmath30 with debye model @xmath28 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the debye temperature .",
    "those equations well explained the temperature dependence of @xmath28 .",
    "physically , this means that the total energy in @xmath16 ray emission and absorption is conserved by the excitation of the vibration of atoms in the lattice with a probability @xmath33 .",
    "the conservation of momentum is satisfied because the momentum is transferred to the whole material , which results in a very small recoil velocity .",
    "this is called the mssbauer effect , which had a significant impact on a large field of physics because it allows us to investigate the nuclear energy level very precisely .",
    "mssbauser spectroscopy is significant because it allows us to investigate the hyperfine structure of the nucleus which is determined by a very local electronic and magnetic structure surrounding the atom involved .",
    "mssbauser specterscopy has been utilized to investigate the chemical properties of @xmath25fe in various materials , confirmation of the gravitational red shift or the uncertainty principle .",
    "although mssbauser spectroscopy has been very widely used in various fields of physics and chemistry , the materials have been limited to those which have convenient radio isotopes . furthermore , the method posseses a poor sensitivity to the solid surfaces because the signal is too weak compared to those from the bulk .",
    "it had been speculated that with a synchrotron radiation one can conduct a similar experiment . in 1990s , the method called nuclear resonant scattering ( nrs ) of synchrotron radiation was established .",
    "the beauty of nrs is that one can make use of the characteristics of the synchrotron radiation which is not obtained using a radio isotope .",
    "( 1 ) the selectivity of the wavelength , ( 2 ) the brilliance of the light source , ( 3 ) high directivity , ( 4 ) the polarization of the light source , ( 5 ) pulse source .    in the present work ,",
    "we focus on the physisorption systems . with a conventional mssbauer spectroscopy",
    ", the radio isotopes for @xmath0kr and @xmath34xe could be obtained but they are not convenient .",
    "their life time is short and thus the experiments has to be done in close to the nuclear reactor . on the contrary , synchrotron radiation of",
    "naturally white , we are able to use the x ray to excite @xmath0kr much easier . furthermore , its high directivity and the significant brilliance are great features when we consider a measurement of the solid surface . with a glancing angle regime , the sensitivity to the solid surface",
    "is expected to be enhanced .",
    "this is a particular feature to the nrs .",
    "we further make use of the polarization of the synchrotron radiation to select the specific excitation lines . @xmath0kr",

    "the lesser the number of the transitions , the easier the analysis of the spectrum . with the selection rule regarding the polarization of the incident light",
    ", we discuss that we successfully reduced the number of transitions from 11 to 4 .    in the conventional mssbauer spectroscopy ,",
    "the energy spectrum of the nuclear levels are obtained . in the nrs , on the other hand ,",
    "the time spectrum of the nuclear levels are obtained by a fast time resolved measurement .",
    "the time spectrum is related to the energy spectrum with a fourier transform .",
    "the example of the hyperfine structure observed in the conventional mssbauer spectroscopy and the nrs is shown in fig .",
    "[ mossnrs ] .",
    "the single peak in the energy spectrum is transformed into a single exponential decay in the time domain .",
    "the double peak due to the hyperfine splitting in the energy spectrum is observed as an oscillation in the time spectrum which is called a quantum beat @xcite .    ]",

    "the larger the hyperfine splitting , the larger the quantum beat frequency becomes .",
    "typically , the hyperfine splitting of nev results in the ns quantum beat structures .    for the simplicity of the analysis",
    ", it greatly helps to reduce the number of transitions .",
    "this is realized by making use of the polarization dependence as schematically shown in fig .",

    "the surface used was a ti riched surface where all the topmost atoms are ti .",
    "therefore , it is expected that a great electric field and its gradient is present at the surface especially in the surface normal direction rather than the surface lateral direction .",
    "the principle axis of the electric field gradient is expected in the surface normal direction as seen in fig .",
    "[ pol ] . in this case , the quantization axis of the quadrupole splitting of @xmath0kr nuclei is also the surface normal direction .",
    "the optical transition from the ground state @xmath38 to the first excited state @xmath39 is m1 transition @xcite .",
    "therefore , the selection rule for the magnetic sub level is @xmath40 . in the m1 transition",
    ", the @xmath41 transition corresponds to the linear magnetic dipole oscillator along the quantization axis , whereas @xmath42 and @xmath43 transitions correspond to the right - handed circular oscillator and left - handed circular oscillator with respect to the quantization axis , respectively @xcite .",

    "if the magnetic oscillator has a component in the direction perpendicular to the surface normal direction , the @xmath44 transitions are excited .",
    "there are following objectives in the present thesis .    1 .",
    "i report an experimental study of litd and nonthermal psd of xe from a au(001 ) surface at photon energies of 6.4 and 2.3 ev . at a high laser fluence",
    ", xe desorption was thermally induced at both photon energies , which is in good agreement with theoretical calculations . at a low laser fluence , on the other hand",
    ", xe desorption was induced nonthermally by 6.4 ev photons as a one - photon process , whereas little desorption was observed with 2.3 ev photons .",
    "we argue that the nonthermal psd proceeds with a transient formation of xe@xmath2 as a result of the photoexcitation of substrate conduction electrons .",
    "a classical model calculation of xe desorption reproduces both the experimentally observed tof and nonthermal psd cross section , assuming a value of the xe@xmath2 lifetime to be @xmath815 fs .",
    "i investigated the laser induced thermal desorption ( litd ) of xe from an au(001 ) surface by means of the time - of - flight ( tof ) measurement as a function of the wide range of desorption flux by varying the initial xe coverage @xmath45 .",
    "we found that at @xmath45 close to 0 ml , the tof was well analyzed by a maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution .",
    "hence , the desorption at @xmath45 close to 0 ml is rationalized by the thermal desorption followed by the collision - free flow . at @xmath45 close to monolayer",
    ", we observed that the peak positions of the tof spectra shift towards smaller values . assuring",
    "that the desorption is only thermally activated , we regard this modification of the tof as the manifestation of the collision effect . at larger @xmath45 ,",

    "the obtained value of @xmath46 and the saturating behavior of u at @xmath48 ml both well coincide with the previously reported values by the knudsen layer theory and simulations .",
    "the facts suggest the formation of the knudsen layer in litd at large @xmath45 .",

    "generally it can be said that the sensitivity of the qms to the massive atoms or molecules is relatively small compared to that to the light atoms or molecules .",

    "desorption via direct excitation from the bound state to a continuum state took place at a photon energy of lower than 1 ev @xcite .",

    "it is noted that the affinity level of xe should lie below the vacuum level for the @xmath215 to be as long as 15 fs .",
    "the obtained value of @xmath215 @xmath815 fs corresponds to the linewidth of 70@xmath11120 mev for the xe@xmath2 state .",

    "the calculated results of fig .",
    "[ qs5 ] ( c ) to ( f ) show features of sharp dips and strong oscillations originating from the interference between the four split lines in fig .",
    "[ qs4 ] . although the experimental data in fig .",
    "[ ts ] ( b ) shows a systematic deviation from the single exponential line , the deviation is not explained by the four lines due to the quadruple splitting of the nuclei of @xmath0kr shown in fig .",
    "these comparison indicate that the experimental result does not suggest a picture that all kr atoms sit in an identical adsorption site and feeling the identical efg and at the same time that the principal axis is in the direction of surface normal with an axial symmetry .",
    "to conclude this subsection , we observed that the experimentally obtained time spectrum in fig .",
    "[ ts ] ( b ) is not in good agreement with the calculated results employing four lines which are split due to the quadrupole splitting of the nuclei of @xmath0kr under the large electric field gradient at the surface shown in fig .",
    "nevertheless , we note that the current comparison does not necessarily indicate that the efg is too small to be observed .",
    "it is true that it is a one of the greatest possibility where the efg was too small to be observed .",
    "there are other remaining possibilities that are not rejected at this moment .",
    "the main topics is whether there is a large efg which is applied on physisorbed atoms at the solid surfaces or not . as can be estimated from the fig .",
    "[ qs4 ] , the effect of efg can be observed if @xmath298 v / m@xmath70 . beside the speculation that there is a large efg at the surface applied on the physisorbed atoms , in the current discussion , we put two more assumptions .",
    "one is the homogeneity of the efg applied on the nuclei of @xmath0kr at the surface .",
    "the other concerns the orientation and the symmetry of the efg at the surface which are assumed to possess a principal axis in the surface normal direction ( i.e. @xmath299 ) and assumed to be axially symmetric ( i.e. @xmath267 ) .",
    "the latter assumption is a basis of the reduction of the transition lines from 11 to 4 with a polarized synchrotron radiation . in the current discussion",
    ", the realization of these two assumptions at the same time is disagreed with .",
    "therefore , it is possible that either one of the two assumptions are true or that both two assumptions are not true even though the efg at the surface was large enough to be observed .",
    "we further point out these three possibilities remained at this moment as potential explanations for the current result .",
    "the first possibility is based on the removal of the first assumption , where the inhomogeneous efg is applied on the nuclei of @xmath0kr which leads to various yields of quadrupole splittings . in this condition , the time spectra are expressed as a sum of the time spectra of which the applied efg is various which thus will be a complicated time spectra . compared to the relatively simple time spectra simulated and shown in fig .",
    "[ qs4 ] ( a ) to ( f ) , the time spectra which is a sum of these various frequencies are inclined to be flat because any major dips in the spectra will not survive .",
    "these kind of situations are possible if the @xmath0kr atoms adsorb on the surface with an incommensurate adsorption structure @xcite .",
    "the second possibility is based on the removal of the second assumption , where , the principal axis of the efg is not parallel to the surface normal direction or the efg in the surface parallel directions are not axially symmetric although the applied efg is homogeneous .",
    "the principal axis is not parallel to the surface normal direction in cases where the efg is stronger in surface normal direction .",
    "even if the principal axis is parallel to the surface normal direction , the efg needs not be axially symmetric on the ( 110 ) surface where the lattice constants in @xmath143 and @xmath144 directions are not identical . in this condition",
    ", the number of transitions is not reduced to 4 but remains to be 11 .",
    "although the time spectra are not simulated yet , the time spectra with a 11 transitions are expected to be more complicated than those in fig .",
    "the resultant time spectra may well be as flat as the observed spectrum .      in order to estimate the absolute value of the efg at the surface , a tentative calculation of the electric filed at the tio@xmath5(110 )",
    "surface was carried out .",
    "the calculated results suggest that there is a large efg that may well be observed in the experiment .",
    "the calculation was carried out by taking sum of the coulomb potential and by taking the derivative and the second derivative of it based on the assumption that each atom behave like a point charge of @xmath36 and @xmath37 which are located at the lattice sites of ti@xmath300 and o@xmath301 . with analytical calculations ,",
    "the potential easily diverges to the infinity . to avoid this divergence of the summation ,",
    "the ewald - kornfeld method was used @xcite and a series of numerical calculations was conducted .",
    "the calculation was carried out by takeyasu @xcite .",
    "( 110 ) surfaces .",
    "the unit of the figures in the contour plot is v / m .",
    "[ efg ] ]    the representative result of the calculation is shown in fig .",
    "figure [ efg ] shows a cross sectional contour plot of the electric field at the vicinity of the tio@xmath5(110 ) surface .",
    "the cross section is parallel to the surface normal direction .",
    "the cross section is orienting in a ( 100 ) direction if seen from the position @xmath302 to the position @xmath303  .",
    "there is a titan atom at the position of ( @xmath143 , @xmath97)=(3.3  , 0 ) in fig .",
    ". there are oxygen atoms at the both sides of fig .",
    "[ efg ] .",
    "previous report on the adsorption structure of ar and xe on tio@xmath5(110 ) both indicates that rare gas atoms adsorb on the outer most titan atoms .",
    "the distance of ar and xe varies from 3   to 4   @xcite .",
    "absolute value of the electric field gradient at this position can be obtained by taking a derivative of the electric field in terms of @xmath143 and @xmath97 , which roughly yields to be about an order of 10@xmath304 v / m@xmath70 . the criteria for the efg applied on the nuclei was about an order larger as 10@xmath305 v / m@xmath70 .",
    "this deviation of an order or two may be compensated if one consider a factor called the sternheimer s anti - shielding factor , which describes that the efg applied on an atom is multiplied by the anti - shielding factor which is then applied on the nuclei due to the distortion of valence electrons @xcite .",
    "the anti - shielding factor yields from 10 to more than 100 depending on the element @xcite .",
    "another feature observed is that as the distance from the surface atoms is increased , the derivative of the electric field parallel to the surface plane become small as compared to that in surface normal direction .",
    "this observation supports the relation of @xmath299 .",
    "in this chapter , conclusions for the study of laser desorption of xe and for the nuclear resonant scattering study of kr are described .",
    "the excitation path and the desorption dynamics are determined for the non - thermal desorption of xe .",
    "the observation of knudsen layer formation in laser induced thermal desorption of xe is confirmed .",
    "the potential explanations for the observed time spectra of nrs are unambiguously presented .",
    "lastly , future prospects for each experiments are mentioned .      in the followings ,",
    "the conclusion of the laser desorption studies are summarized .",
    "firstly , the implication of the stabilization of the affinity level of the physisorbed xe is mentioned .",
    "secondly , the formation of the knudsen layer due to the post - desorption collision effects are described .",
    "we have investigated the psd of xe on au(001 ) at photon energies of 2.3 and 6.4 ev @xcite . with decreasing pump laser fluence ,",
    "the desorption was found to undergo transition from thermal to non - thermal regimes .",
    "the non - thermal psd of xe occurred only at 6.4 ev as a one - photon process , and the desorption proceeds via the antoniewicz model with transient negative ion formation . on the basis of the model calculation ,",
    "the lifetime of xe@xmath306 is estimated to be @xmath815 fs .",
    "these results strongly suggest that the affinity level of xe is substantially stabilized by the metal proximity effect .",
    "we observed the tofs of xe from a au(001 ) surface by litd at a wide range of @xmath45 . at @xmath307",
    "ml , the tof is well analyzed by the maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution at 255 k indicating thermal desorption followed by the collision - free flow . at @xmath242",
    "ml , the tof is well analyzed by the shifted maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution , which is regarded as the manifestations of the post - desorption collision effects . at @xmath252",
    "ml , the value of @xmath202 under the assumption that @xmath47 became constant at around 125 m / s , which corresponds to @xmath308 , being in good agreement with the prediction by the knudsen layer formation theory . in the litd experiment , we found that the collision effect already appears at kn @xmath309 and that the knudsen layer is formed at kn @xmath310 , which corresponds to a mean collision number of greater than 2.6 per atom for general systems .",
    "nrs by physisorbed kr on a solid surface in both multi - layer and monolayer regime are achieved for the first time thanks to the experimental realization of the glancing angle regime with an uhv chamber equipped with a cold head .",
    "the time spectra of nrs by 5 ml kr shows a decay time of 96 ns whereas the decay time at 1 ml was 109 ns , indicating a dynamical effect is in play .",
    "the time spectrum at 1 ml kr is compared with the simulated time spectra based on the quadrupole splitting and the selection rule where only 4 of 11 transitions are allowed .",
    "the experimentally obtained spectrum is not in good agreement with the simulated result with large electric field gradient ( efg ) .",
    "the comparison indicates the following possibilities .",
    "1 .   efg at the surface is too small ( @xmath311 v / m@xmath70 ) for the quadrupole splitting to be observed in the time spectra of nrs .",
    "2 .   although the electric field gradient is large enough for the quadrupole splitting to be observed , either one or neither of the following assumptions ( that are used in the simulations ) are fulfilled in the experiment .",
    "the adsorption site of kr at 1 ml is only one where the identical efg is applied on all the @xmath0kr nuclei .",
    "the main axis of the efg is parallel to the surface normal direction .",
    "the efg in the surface parallel direction is axially symmetric .",
    "the efg at the surface of tio@xmath5(110 ) was estimated based on a numerical calculation .",
    "the result shows the absolute value of efg was large enough ( @xmath312 v / m@xmath70 ) for the time spectra of nrs to be observed , although the axial symmetry on ( 110 ) surface is not positively confirmed .      as for",
    "the non - thermal photon stimulated desorption of xe , i proposed a stabilization of xe@xmath2 state at the vicinity of the metal surface .",
    "this is a condensation effect .",
    "further investigation on this effect may be possible if one investigate a coverage dependence of the photon stimulated desorption yield of xe or if one observe the electron affinity level of xe at surface more directly using methods such as two - photon photoemission spectroscopy or scanning tunneling spectroscopy on the similar system .",
    "the potential specialty of au surface may also be interesting as compared to pt , ag or else .",
    "watanabe reported that there was no signifiant photon stimulated desorption of xe from pt(111 ) surfaces @xcite . considering the inconsistency of this report and the present result @xcite",
    ", the fundamental difference between au surface and pt surface may be found by further investigations .",
    "the speciality may arise from the electronic structure of each surface originating from the @xmath81 electrons and @xmath240 electrons , respectively .",
    "angular resolved experiments possess a larger impact on the study of the collision effects in laser induced thermal desorption , in order to more vividly take a hold of the whole picture of the knudsen layer formation .",
    "another fascinating advanced experiment of the laser desorption should concern the desorption of binary mixture of different atoms or molecules .",
    "it has been theoretically predicted that the fast desorption of a mixture of heavy and light atoms will results in a jet effect , where heavy atoms gets larger and center oriented momentum in the surface normal direction @xcite .",
    "cometary comma and its tails are assumed to be connected with a knudsen layer @xcite .",
    "thus , further exploration of the collision effects in laser induced thermal desorption has a potentially impact on the planetary science . for the simplicity of the phenomena ,",
    "the present experiment was carried out using a mono atomic gas .",
    "the real comet is known to consists mainly of amorphous solid water @xcite .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of the generation of the dust tail of comets may be clarified by an investigation on the rapid desorption of h@xmath5o molecules from the surfaces , which may be realized in the experiment room by using the laser induced thermal desorption of water ice .",
    "the present study showed that the nrs of kr in the monolayer regime is able to be recorded .",
    "next , the goal should be the use of the technique for the measurements of properties of materials .",
    "further , detailed preparation of the sample surface including the adsorption structure and the axially symmetric substrate ( e.g. ( 111 ) or ( 001 ) surfaces ) are even more plausible for the experiment .",
    "the efg of the solid surface will be observable with such a preparation .",
    "the beauty of the adsorption of kr on the surface is that they are not destructive at all .",
    "therefore , the use of kr as a probe of the surface properties is a promising way .",
    "the interaction between solid surfaces and the kr atoms is only van der waals interactions .",
    "hence , by varying the sample substrates , the efg at respective surfaces such as metal , insulator and semiconductor surfaces can be compared by use of the nrs by kr at each surfaces ."
