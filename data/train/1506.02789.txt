    "as mentioned in section [ sec_so ] , when the deterministic part of the mi function is linear , the uncertainty in mi does not significantly influence the trader s behavior , even when the trader is risk - averse . in future work , we will investigate the case of nonlinear mi .",
    "explicitly introducing trading volume processes is another important generalization . in some studies of the optimization problem of volume - weighted average price ( vwap ) slippage ,",
    "the trading volume processes are introduced as stochastic processes .",
    "for instance , @xcite studies a minimization problem of the tracking error of vwap execution strategies ( see @xcite for a definition of vwap execution strategies ) . in @xcite ,",
    "a cumulative trading volume process is defined as a gamma process .",
    "moreover , @xcite treats a generalized almgren ",
    "chriss model such that a temporary mi function depends on instantaneous trading volume processes , and shows that an optimal execution strategy of a risk - neutral trader is actually the vwap execution strategy .",
