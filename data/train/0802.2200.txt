    "it is the characteristic feature of soft matter systems that a macromolecular component of nano- to micrometer size is dispersed in a solvent of much smaller molecules .",
    "the mesoscopic length scale of the dispersed component implies that crystalline phases have a very small shear modulus  which roughly scales like the inverse of the third power of the structural length scale  and that both crystalline and fluid phases are characterized by long structural relaxation times .",
    "soft matter systems have therefore interesting dynamical properties , because the time scale of an external perturbation can easily become comparable with the intrinsic relaxation time of the dispersed macromolecules .",
    "one of the unique properties of soft matter is its viscoelastic behavior@xcite . due to the long structural relaxation time",
    ", the internal degrees of freedom can not relax sufficiently fast in an oscillatory shear flow , so that there is some elastic restoring force which pushes the system back to its previous state .",
    "a very well studied example of viscoelastic fluids are polymer solutions and polymer melts@xcite . in the case of polymer melts ,",
    "the characteristic time scale is given by the reptation time , _",
    "i.e. _ by the time it takes a chain to slide by its contour length along the tube formed by other polymer chains@xcite .",
    "in order to bridge the length- and time - scale gap between the solvent and macromolecular or colloidal scales , several mesoscopic simulation techniques  such as the lattice - boltzmann method , dissipative - particle dynamics ( dpd ) , and multi - particle collision dynamics ( mpc )  have been suggested in recent years , and are in the process of being developed further .",
    "the idea of all these methods is to strongly simplify the microscopic dynamics in order to gain computational efficiency , but at the same time to exactly satisfy the conservation laws of mass , momentum and energy , so that hydrodynamic behavior emerges naturally on larger length scales .",
    "we will focus here on the multi - particle collision dynamics ( mpc ) technique@xcite , also called stochastic rotation dynamics@xcite ( srd ) , originally developed for newtonian fluids .",
    "this particle - based hydrodynamics method consists of alternating streaming and collision steps . in the streaming step , point particles move ballistically . in the collision step ,",
    "particles are sorted into the cells of a simple cubic ( or square ) lattice .",
    "all particles in a cell collide by a rotation of their velocities relative to the center - of - mass velocity around a random axis@xcite .",
    "a random shift of the cell lattice is performed before each collision step in order to restore galilean invariance@xcite .",
    "this method has been applied very successfully to study the hydrodynamic behavior of many complex fluids , such as polymer solutions in equilibrium@xcite and flow@xcite , colloidal dispersions@xcite , vesicle suspensions@xcite , and reactive fluids@xcite .",
    "the viscoelastic behavior of polymer solutions leads to many unusual flow phenomena , such as shear - induced phase separation@xcite , viscoelastic phase separation@xcite , and elastic turbulence@xcite .",
    "a coarse - grained description of viscoelastic fluids is necessary in order to obtain a detailed understanding of the role of elastic forces in such flow instabilities .",
    "however , there is a second level of complexity in soft matter system , in which a colloidal component is dispersed in a solvent , which is itself a complex fluid .",
    "examples are spherical or rod - like colloids dispersed in polymer solutions or melts , which are exposed to a shear flow@xcite .",
    "shear flow can induce particle aggregation and alignment in these systems .",
    "this is important , for example , in the processing of nanocomposites@xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is therefore the development of a mpc algorithm , which is able to describe viscoelastic phenomena , but at the same time retains the computational simplicity of standard mpc for newtonian fluids , and thereby allows to take advantage of this mesoscale simulation for the investigation of flow instabilities as well as suspensions with viscoelastic solvents .",
    "we show that this goal can be achieved by replacing the point particles of standard mpc by harmonic dumbbells . in order to obtain a strong elastic contribution",
    ", we consider a fluid , which consists of dumbbells only .",
    "however , it is of course straightforward to mix dumbbells with a point - particle solvent .",
    "a similar idea has been suggested recently for dpd fluids@xcite .",
    "in our mpc model , we consider @xmath0 point particles of mass @xmath1 , which are pairwise connected by a harmonic potential @xmath2 to form dumbbells , where @xmath3 is the spring constant . the center - of - mass position @xmath4 and velocity @xmath5 for each dumbbell @xmath6 , with @xmath7 ,",

    "the vectors @xmath19 and @xmath20 are different for each time step , and are calculated from the relative positions and velocities of the point particles of dumbbell @xmath6 before the streaming step , @xmath21 in the mpc algorithm described here , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are continuous variables , evolving in discrete increments of time . in the absence of shear flow , the average length of the dumbbell is @xmath26 for a @xmath27-dimensional system .    in the collision step , the point particles are sorted into the cells of a cubic lattice with lattice constant @xmath28 .",
    "multi - particle collisions are performed for all particles in a cell @xmath29 , by the same srd algorithm@xcite as for point particle fluids .",

    "this step guarantees that each particle changes the direction as well as the magnitude of its velocity during the multi - particle collisions , while the local momentum and the kinetic energy are conserved .",
    "random shifts are applied in each direction , so that the galilean invariance is ensured even in case of small mean free path@xcite .    in order to describe couette or oscillatory shear flow ,",

    "extra virtual point particles are added to conserve the monomer number density , @xmath47 , defined by the average number of monomers per cell@xcite . in principle , the velocities of the virtual particles can be drawn from a maxwell - boltzmann distribution of average velocity equal to the wall velocity and variance @xmath48 , where @xmath49 the bulk temperature . in the simulation code , it is not necessary to sample the velocity of virtual wall particles individually . a random vector from maxwell - boltzmann distribution with wall velocity and variance @xmath50 is then used instead of the contribution of the entire virtual particles in the cell , where @xmath51 is the number of real particles in that cell . for point particles ,",
    "the combination of bounce - back boundary condition and virtual wall particles has been shown to guarantee no - slip boundary condition to a very good approximation@xcite .      in order to keep the system temperature constant ,",
