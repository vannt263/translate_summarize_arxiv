    "inspection of the trajectories shows that the sharp bend of the graphs close to an absorbed energy of @xmath54  ev corresponds to the damage threshold of the material .",

    "the @xmath53  fs to @xmath11  fs graphs show an absorption growing sharply with pulse intensity , because all structural changes induced by the laser can take place while the pulse intensity is still high .",

    "again , a strong increase of absorption takes place at the damage threshold , which in graphite is found to be at roughly 3  ev . at this threshold , melting of graphite and the destruction of the graphite planes takes place . at lower intensities , absorption shows a moderate , linear increase with laser intensity .",

    "the slope of the absorption curves is lower for higher pulse durations . interpreting this with the help of the density of states",
