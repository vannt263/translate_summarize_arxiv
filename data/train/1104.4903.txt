    "electrical devices on the nanoscale have received substantial interest in the last decade @xcite .",
    "impressive progress has been achieved in contacting single molecules or molecular aggregates with normal - conducting or even superconducting metallic leads @xcite .",
    "the objective is to exploit nonlinear transport properties of molecular junctions as the elementary units for a future molecular electronics .",
    "while the first experimental set - ups have been operated at room temperature , meanwhile low temperatures down to the millikelvin range , the typical regime for devices in mesoscopic solid state physics , are accessible ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this allows for detailed studies of phenomena such as inelastic charge transfer due to molecular vibrations @xcite , voltage driven conformational changes of the molecular backbone @xcite , kondo physics @xcite , and andreev reflections @xcite to name but a few .",
    "these developments have been accompanied by efforts to advance theoretical approaches in order to obtain an understanding of generic physical processes on the one hand and to arrive at a tool to quantitatively describe and predict experimental data . for this purpose ,",
    "basically two strategies have been followed .",
    "one is based on ab initio schemes that have been successfully employed for isolated molecular structures as e.g. density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "combining dft with nonequilibrium greens functions ( negf ) allows to capture essential properties for junctions with specific molecular structures and geometries @xcite .",
    "this provides insight in electronic formations along contacted molecules and gives at least qualitatively correct results for currents and differential conductances .",
    "however , a quantitative description on the level of accuracy known from conventional mesoscopic devices seems out of reach yet .",
    "further , these methods are not able to capture phenomena due to strong correlations such as e.g.  kondo resonances .",
    "thus , an alternative route , mainly inspired by solid state methodologies , starts with simplified models that are assumed to cover relevant physical features .",
    "the intention then is to reveal fundamental processes characteristic for molecular electronics that give a qualitative description of observations from realistic samples , but provide also the basis for a proper design of molecular junctions to exploit these processes .",
    "information about specific molecular set - ups appears merely in form of parameters which offers a large amount of flexibility . in general , to attack the respective many body problems , perturbative schemes have been applied , the most powerful of which are nonequilibrium greens functions @xcite .",
    "conceptually simpler , easier to implement , and often better revealing the physics are treatments in terms of master or rate equations .",
    "being approximations to the negf frame in certain ranges of parameters space , they sometimes lack the strictness of perturbation series , but have been extensively employed for mesoscopic devices @xcite and quantitatively often provide data of at least similar accuracy . roughly speaking",
    ", these schemes apply as long as quantum correlations between relevant sub - units of the full compound are sufficiently weak @xcite .",
    "physically , it places charge transfer through molecular contacts in the context of inelastic charge transfer through ultra - small metallic contacts ( dynamical coulomb blockade @xcite ) and in the context of solvent or vibronic mediated intramolecular charge transfer ( marcus theory ) @xcite .    while rate descriptions have been developed in a variety of formulations before @xcite",

    "has been successfully implemented only very recently in form of a diagrammatic monte carlo approach @xcite . path integral monte carlo methods have been used previously for intramolecular charge transfer in complex aggregates @xcite in a variety of situations including correlated @xcite and externally driven transfer @xcite and , of particular relevance for the present work , transfer in presence of prominent phonon modes @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present work is to study a simple yet highly non - trivial set - up , namely , a molecular contact with a single molecular level coupled to a prominent vibronic mode ( phonon ) which itself may or may not be embedded in a bosonic heat bath .",
    "we develop rate descriptions of various complexity , place them into the context of negf , and compare them with exact data .",

    "we start with the minimal model of a molecular contact consisting of a single electronic level coupled to fermionic reservoirs , where a prominent internal molecular phonon mode interacting with the excess charge is described by a harmonic degree of freedom ( cf .",

    "below , this model will be further extended to include the embedding of the prominent mode into a large reservoir of residual molecular and/or solvent degrees of freedom acting as a heat bath .",
    "qualitatively , since the dot occupation @xmath10 can only take the values @xmath11 , the sub - unit @xmath12 describes a two state system coupled to a harmonic mode ( spin - boson model @xcite ) .",
    "depending on the charge state of the dot the phonon mode is subject to potentials @xmath13 .",
    "now , the presence of the leads acts ( for finite voltages ) as an external driving force to alternately charging ( @xmath14 ) and discharging ( @xmath15 ) the dot , thus switching alternately between @xmath16 and @xmath17 for the phonon mode . the classical energy needed to reorganize",
    "the phonon is the so - called reorganization energy @xmath18 .",

    "this scenario corresponds to the diabatic regime with well - defined surfaces @xmath43 . in the opposite regime",
    "@xmath44 charge transfer is fast so that the phonon may obey multiples of switchings _ between the surfaces _ @xmath20 .",
    "this is the adiabatic regime . in this latter range",
    "the impact of the adiabaticity on the diabatic ground state wave functions is weak for @xmath45 when the distance of the diabatic surfaces is small compared to the widths of the ground states . for @xmath46 in both regimes",
    "electron transfer is accompanied by phonon tunneling through energy barriers separating minima of adiabatic or diabatic surfaces .",

    "we note again the close analogy to the @xmath0-theory for dynamical coulomb blockade @xcite .",
    "moreover , golden rule rates for intramolecular electron transfer between donor and acceptor sites coupled to a single phonon mode are of the same structure with the notable difference , of course , that in this case one has discrete density of states for both sites @xcite .",
    "the fundamental assumption underlying the golden rule treatment is that equilibration of the phonon mode occurs much faster than charge transfer . in the last two situations",

    "the fermionic reservoirs in the leads impose phonon relaxation only due to charge transfer .",
    "thus , for finite voltage the steady state is always a nonequilibrium state that can only roughly be described by a thermal distribution of the bare phonon system ( see below ) .",

    "[ sec1 ] , a rate description does indeed provide even quantitatively accurate results in the regime of weak to moderate electron - phonon coupling @xmath45 and for all @xmath152 .",
    "deviations that occur for larger values of @xmath47 can partially be explained by nonequilibrium distributions in the phonon distribution , where , however , the master equation approach seems to overestimate this effect . in order to obtain some insight into the nature of this deficiency ,",
    "a minimal approach consists of adding to ( [ neqmaster1 ] ) with the extension ( [ replacement ] ) a mechanism that enforces relaxation to thermal equilibrium with a single rate constant @xmath181 that serves as a fitting parameter .",
    "accordingly , the respective time evolution equation for @xmath182 receives an additional term @xmath183 $ ] with the boltzmann distribution for the bare phonon degree of freedom @xmath184 .",

    "astonishingly , this procedure provides an excellent agreement over the full voltage range .",
    "it improves results particularly in the range of moderate to stronger electron phonon coupling , but has only minor impact for @xmath45 .",
    "the indication is thus that electron - phonon correlations neglected in the original form of the master equation have effectively the tendency to support faster thermalization of the phonon . indeed ,",
    "preliminary results with a generalized master equation where the coupling between diagonal ( populations ) and off - diagonal ( coherences ) elements of the reduced charge - phonon density matrix are retained ( no rwa approximation ) indicate that this coupling leads to an enhanced phonon - lead interaction and thus to enhanced phonon equilibration .",

    "<S> * background : * the trend to fabricate electrical circuits on nanoscale dimensions has led to impressive progress in the field of molecular electronics in the last decade . a theoretical description of molecular contacts as the building blocks of future devices is challenging though as it has to combine properties of fermi liquids in the leads with charge and phonon degrees of freedom on the molecule . apart from ab initio schemes for specific set - ups , </S>",
    "<S> generic models reveal characteristics of transport processes . particularly appealing are descriptions based on transfer rates successfully used in other contexts such as mesoscopic physics and intramolecular electron transfer . </S>",
    "<S> however , a detailed analysis of this scheme in comparison with numerically exact data is elusive yet .    * results : * it turns out that a formulation in terms of transfer rates provides a quantitatively accurate description even in domains of parameter space where in a strict sense it is expected to fail , e.g.  for lower temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> typically , intramolecular phonons are distributed according to a voltage driven steady state that can only roughly be captured by a thermal distribution with an effective elevated temperature ( heating ) . </S>",
    "<S> an extension of a master equation for the charge - phonon complex to include effectively the impact of off - diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix provides very accurate data even for stronger electron - phonon coupling .    * conclusion : * rate descriptions and master equations offer a versatile instrument to describe and understand charge transfer processes through molecular junctions . </S>",
    "<S> they are computationally orders of magnitudes less expensive than elaborate numerical simulations that , however , provide exact data as benchmarks . </S>",
    "<S> adjustable parameters obtained e.g.  from ab initio calculations allow for the treatment of various realizations . </S>",
    "<S> even though not as rigorously formulated as e.g. nonequilibrium greens function methods , they are conceptually simpler , more flexible for extensions , and from a practical point of view provide accurate results as long as strong quantum correlations do not modify properties of relevant sub - units substantially . </S>"
