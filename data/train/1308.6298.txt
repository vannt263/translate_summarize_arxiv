    "filamentary structure is ubiquitous in molecular clouds , both actively star forming and quiescent .",
    "moreover , these works have shown that , regardless of whether the filaments are actively forming stars or not , they often contain dense clumps and cores , which may or may not harbor young stellar objects . if not , the cores are labeled `` prestellar '' .",
    "numerous physical mechanisms have been advocated for the formation of the filaments , such as the gravitational instability of a flattened isothermal cloud , with and without magnetic fields ; supersonic mhd isothermal turbulence ; and turbulence in thermally unstable gas .",
    "however , recent numerical simulations of cloud formation and evolution including self - gravity systematically show that the clouds , rather than remaining globally supported by turbulence , engage in global gravitational contraction .",
    "these results suggest that , although the interstellar medium is highly turbulent , the dynamics and structure of star - forming molecular clouds , and the filaments within them , may actually be dominated by gravity .",
    "that cold clouds may be in a state of global gravitational contraction should not come in as a surprise , since the formation mechanism of cold clouds may quickly endow them with masses much larger than their jeans mass .",
    "indeed , cold clouds are expected to form , at least in solar - neighborhood - like environments , by means of large - scale , coherent compressions in the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) , driven , for example , by * large ( kpc)*-scale instabilities * ( jeans , toomre , parker , and combinations thereof ) * ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or * else * by the generic turbulence in this medium , which is typically transonic ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such compressions in the wnm are expected to induce a sudden phase transition to the cold neutral medium , which has a density roughly @xmath8 larger and a temperature roughly @xmath8 lower than those of the wnm .",
    "thus , the jeans mass , proportional to @xmath9 , drops by a factor @xmath10 , and so the gas can easily acquire a large number of jeans masses upon the phase transition from the warm to the cold phase .",
    "this implies that the ensuing collapse must occur in an essentially pressureless manner .",
    "however , if the collapse occurs in a nearly pressureless form , an important consequence follows : as the collapse proceeds , it is expected to amplify any deviations from isotropy , since it has been known for a long time that pressureless triaxial spheroids collapse first along their shortest dimension @xcite , producing first sheets and then filaments .",
    "interestingly , then , the formation of structures in cold , dense clouds may be qualitatively similar to that in the so - called `` cosmic web '' , which is believed to be permeating intergalactic space , and which consists of a network of filaments with dense galaxy clusters within them . in the cosmic web",
    ", the filamentary structures are certainly not expected to be in equilibrium , since they are actually undergoing gravitational collapse .",
    "quite the opposite , the filaments feed material to the clusters sitting within them and play a crucial role on the evolution of the galaxies in the clusters . since observations of nearby molecular clouds @xcite as well as recent simulations of molecular cloud formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show a similar hub - filament structure , it is tempting to infer that the physical process in the cold clouds is similar as well , implying that their filamentary environment might have a strong influence on the evolution of pre - stellar cores ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is important to point out , however , that , contrary to the cosmological case , a nascent cold cloud is internally turbulent , due to several fluid instabilities acting during its formation process @xcite .",
    "it has been thought for some time that this turbulence may be strong enough to support the clouds , and to simultaneously induce local compressions in which the local jeans mass is reduced sufficently to cause the local fluctuation to undergo collapse @xcite .",
    "however , early on it was pointed out by @xcite that generally , the turbulent compressions alone do not provide a sufficent reduction of the local jeans mass as to directly induce local collapse .",
    "this is supported by the fact that numerical simulations of cloud formation indicate that the turbulence generated as the cloud is assembled is only moderately , rather than strongly , supersonic , and that _ local _ gravitational collapse does not start until several million years later in the clouds evolution , after significant contraction of the clouds at large .",
    "however , once the nonlinear density fluctuations begin to collapse locally , they do so on shorter timescales than that of the whole cloud , precisely because of their nonlinearly larger local density compared to the average cloud density , causing a regime of hierarchical gravitational fragmentation ( i.e. , of collapses within collapses ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , similar to the regime originally proposal of @xcite , except for the nonlinearity of the density fluctuations ( see , e.g. , the review by * ? ? ?",
    "note also that , as originally pointed out by @xcite , if the collapse is nearly isothermal , then number of jeans masses in a cloud increases as it collapses .",
    "this implies that the collapse of the cloud continues to behave as a pressure - free flow .",
    "although the thermal pressure does indeed increase during the collapse , it is always lagging behind the gravitational energy density , and by an ever - larger margin . in this way , the collapse of a turbulent , isothermal cloud is seen to behave similarly to the collisionless dark matter fluid and thus it is expected to proceed by enhancing its eccentricity , effectively collapsing first along its shortest dimension , and thus forming first sheets and then filaments @xcite .",
    "the filaments formed by this global process are expected to be surrounded by this accretion - driven _ ram_-pressure , and dynamically very different from filaments confined by the thermal pressure of a static medium .",
    "recent observational studies have emphasized the filamentary structure of molecular clouds , mainly thanks to the advent of the _ herschel _ telescope , devoting special attention to the spatial and velocity structure of the filaments , and the implied accretion rates onto and along the filaments @xcite . with this in mind , in this paper , we present a new , high - resolution numerical simulation of dense cloud formation by colliding flows , and report the physical conditions of the filaments that develop in this simulation by gravitational contraction .",
    "we have chosen this setup as it provides a self - consistent mechanism for driving the turbulence in the forming dense cloud , contrary to the case of simulations in which the turbulence * is * externally driven by a force generated in fourier space and applied everywhere in the flow . the latter scheme , although quite common in the literature , has the disadvantage that the turbulent mach number is imposed , rather than self - consistently produced , and thus it is not possible to know whether it is realistic or not .",
    "an exceesive imposed turbulent mach number can indeed have the effect of providing global support while simultaneously inducing local collapse , eliminating the feature of global collapse , but this is likely to be an artifact of the excessive and whole - volume - application nature of the driving .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in  [ sec : model ] we present the numerical simulation , to then discuss its global evolution in  [ sec : global_evol ] .",
    "next , in ",
    "[ sec : filaments ] we report the physical properties and conditions in one fiducial filament that develops in the simulation .",
    "finally , in  [ sec : summary ] , we present a summary and our conclusions .",
    "the simulation used in this study is similar to the simulation l256@xmath110.17 discussed in , although performed at a significantly higher resolution ( @xmath12 sph particles _ versus _",
    "@xmath13 ) , and performed with the gadget-2 code , while in paper i the code gadget was used .",
    "the simulation describes the collision of two oppositely - directed streams of warm gas .",
    "the collision triggers a transition to the cold phase , forming a cloud that rapidly grows in mass by accretion of the warm , diffuse inflow material until it becomes jeans unstable and begins to collapse .",
    "we refer the reader to paper i for specific details of the setup and a description of the more general behavior .",
    "while the general behavior of the simulation is the same as in paper i , the higher resolution causes some differences in the details of the evolution , which we describe below .",
    "the simulation was performed in a box of @xmath14 per side , initially filled with warm gas of uniform density ( @xmath15 ) and temperature ( @xmath16 k ) .",
    "the box thus contains a total mass of @xmath17 . at our chosen number of sph particles , assuming a mass per gas particle of @xmath18 , the mass per sph particle in our simulation is @xmath19 .",
    "two cylindrical regions within this box were set to collide within this box , with initial velocities @xmath20 ( @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the adiabatic sound speed ) , and @xmath23 , so that they collide at the central @xmath24 plane of the box .",
    "note that the inflows have the same density as the ambient medium , so they are only distinguished from it by their velocity , not by their density .",
    "the dimensions of the cylinders were @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and thus contained @xmath27 each , causing the total mass in the cold cloud to be @xmath28 .",
    "note that the mass is larger than twice the mass in the inflows because the latter entrain some ambient material that is ultimately accreted onto the cloud .",
    "in addition to these flows , small - amplitude turbulent motions were added to the gas , in order to break the symmetry of the setup and allow the development of instabilities in the dense layer formed by the collision ( the cloud ) . as in paper",
    "i , the code was modified to model the formation of sink particles .",
    "specifically , in order to prevent the timestep from becoming arbitrarily small when a certain region of the flow undergoes gravitational collapse , once a region becomes denser than a certain threshold @xmath29 , it undergoes a number of tests to determine whether it is collapsing .",
    "if the tests are passed , then the mass in the region is removed from the gas phase and a `` sink particle '' is created , which inherits the total mass and momentum of the removed sph particles @xcite . in turn , the sink particle itself may continue to accrete mass from the gas phase . in the present simulation , we have taken @xmath30 , the same as that in paper i .. ] in addition , we also implemented the radiative heating and cooling function used in paper i , which in turn was taken from @xcite , only correcting some typographical errors .",
    "the effect of more realistic cooling functions has been recently investigated by @xcite , showing that they are in general minor .",
    "the collision of the flows in the center of the box induces a phase transition in the flow from diffuse - warm to cold - dense gas , producing a dense layer of cold gas that grows in mass over time @xcite .",
    "the ram pressure - confined dense layer is subject to bending - mode and hydrodynamical instabilities , causing the development of moderately supersonic turbulence within it @xcite , which in turn produces nonlinear density fluctuations .",
    "moreover , the dense layer continues to accrete gas from the original inflows , thus increasing its mass .",
    "eventually , as was shown in paper i , the layer at large becomes gravitationally unstable and begins to contract .",
    "some time later , before the global contraction is completed , the local density fluctuations also become unstable due to the decrease of the average jeans mass , and begin to collapse themselves . because they are nonlinearly overdense with respect to the global cloud average",
    ", they have shorter free - fall times than that of the cloud at large , completing their collapse before the whole cloud does .",
    "paper i aimed at investigating the combined effects of cooling , turbulence generation in the compressed layer ( the cloud ) , and self - gravity , finding that the cloud grows in mass until its gravitational energy overtakes the turbulent kinetic energy , at which time it begins to undergo gravitational collapse . however , the turbulent kinetic energy induced by the instabilities in the compressed layer was not very large ( the mach number was of the order of a few only ; see also * ? ? ? * ) , and velocities corresponding to mach numbers typical of giant molecular clouds only developed as a consequence of the gravitational collapse , and corresponded to the collapsing motions themselves , not to random turbulence .",
    "several myr after the onset of global collapse , local collapses began to occur , seeded by the density fluctuations produced by the moderately supersonic turbulence produced by the flow collision",
    ".    however , in the main simulation of paper i , of which the present simulation is a remake at higher resolution , most of the early star formation occurred in a high density ring that formed at the circular periphery of the flat cloud caused by the inflowing cylinders .",
    "instead , in the higher - resolution run presented here , the lower numerical viscosity allows the gas to squirt out more freely from the colliding region , so that the high density ring does not form ( see fig.[fig : faceon ] ) .",
    "this has two implications .",
    "first , while in the run from paper i all the initial local collapses occurred in the peripheral ring , in the present simulation they occur throughout the dense layer .",
    "second , while in paper i the ring itself quickly began contracting and falling onto the center of the dense layer , here , in the absence of such a ring , both the local and global collapses are less focused , and thus take longer to develop .",
    "so , while sink formation started at @xmath31 in paper i , here it begins at @xmath32 .",
    "also , the global collapse is less coherent .",
    "while in paper i the time at which the ring reaches the simulation center is very well defined , signaling the culmination of the large - scale collapse , here the dense layer fragments into filaments , which then form clumps , onto which the rest of the filament continues to accrete .",
    "this is understood in terms of the fact that the collapse timescale for a long filament of aspect ratio @xmath33 is longer than that of a roughly spherical clump of the same volume density by a factor between @xmath34 and @xmath35 , depending on whether the collapse is homologous or proceeds outside - in @xcite . only later",
    ", the entire filament - clump system falls into the large - scale potential well at the center of the simulation .",
    "specifically , the free - fall time at the mean initial density of cloud after the phase transition ( @xmath36 ) is @xmath37 myr .",
    "however , in practice , the global collapse of the cloud occurs over roughly 20 myr ( see paper i and fig .   [",
    "fig : faceon ] ) , from @xmath38 myr to @xmath39 myr .",
    "the fact that the usage of higher resolution ( and perhaps also the different version of the code ) produce a different morphological pattern is a reflection of the chaotic nature of the system , which exhibits sensitivity to initial conditions ( i.e. , arbitrarily nearby initial conditions end up producing very different states after finite evolution times ) .",
    "however , the differences occur only at the level of morphological detail , and with timing differences at the @xmath40% level .",
    "statistically , the two simulations behave in a similar manner , developing local collapses that culminate earlier than the global collapse .",
    "it is important to remark that the collision of wnm currents , aided by thermal instability , initially forms a planar structure , or sheet - like cloud , which rapidly becomes jeans - unstable and breaks into filamentary structures . in parallel",
    ", the sheet keeps accreting material from the inflows , implying that the amount of gas that has undergone the phase transition into cnm ( the cloud s mass ) increases in time . in a similar way ,",
    "once formed , the filaments accrete mass from the larger planar structure , increasing their mass until they become gravitationally unstable ; the filaments then collapse as a whole .",
    "but , in turn , the filaments fragment into a number of clumps because they have a longer free - fall time than any roughly spherical , jeans - unstable fluctuation within them @xcite .",
    "thus , the clumps within the filaments increase their own density and develop a density contrast with respect to their parent filament .",
    "material from the filament continues to `` rain down '' ( accrete ) onto the clumps , while continuing to be fed by the accretion flow from the sheetlike cloud .",
    "the whole system thus constitutes a mass cascade from the largest to the smallest scales in the cloud , similar to that envisioned by @xcite , except that those authors proposed a process in which the energy released by the collapse at each scale produces random , quasi - isotropic motions at a smaller scale ( see their sec .  3 ) .",
    "instead , what we observe in our simulation is a continuous gravitational collapse all the way down to the protostar scale , as observed , for example , by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "also , a distinctive feature of this cascade is that the structures at different scales have different morphologies : from sheets to filaments , and from filaments to clumps .",
    "a crucial feature of these structures is that _ none of them are in equilibrium . _ instead , they represent a continuous flow towards the troughs of the gravitational potential , at both local and global scales , giving rise to a regime of collapses within collapses , or _",
    "hierarchical gravitational fragmentation _ @xcite . structures are actually _ features of the flow _ that persist because they continuously being fed by the accretion flow .",
    "one very important kind of such features are the filaments , which recently have received much observational attention . in fig .",
    "[ fig : faceon ] we show four snapshots of the simulation viewed face - on , showing the formation of the filaments and then their merging to form a final dense collapse center . in the remainder of the paper",
    ", we now discuss the physical properties of the filaments that develop in our simulation .",
    "it is important to point out that it is difficult to assign a well - defined timescale to the filaments , because typically they last longer than their crossing time , due to the accretion .",
    "moreover , they take time to assemble and to take a well defined shape . in any case , the filaments we discuss in the next section roughly last @xmath41 myr , from @xmath42 to @xmath43 myr , from the time when they first become discernible to the time when they finish accreting onto their nearest main clump .",

    "[ fig : faceon ] ) .",
    "the coordinates shown in the axes are measured with respect to the center of the simulation box .",

    "[ sec : global_evol ] , the filaments soon develop dense cores . by the time shown in figs .",

    "thus , each of the individual structures formed from the original collision of wnm currents acts as a channel that funnels mass from the parent to the child structures .",
    "moreover , as time goes on , the scale of the filament - clump system grows , involving increasing amounts of mass and correspondingly larger spatial scales .",
    "for example , in the bottom - right panel of fig .",

    ", we have calculated the column density along lines of sight ( loss ) approximately perpendicular to the filaments .",
    "we first obtained the density distribution of the gas on two boxes with @xmath75 grid points , each containing one of the filaments , with resulting resolution of @xmath76 for filament 1 , and @xmath77 for filament 2 .",
    "then , taking advantage of the fact that the filaments lie on the @xmath72-@xmath71 plane , and noting , from visual inspection , that the loss are at angles @xmath78 and @xmath79 from the @xmath71-axis in figs .",
    "[ fig : fil1 ] and [ fig : fil2 ] , respectively , we thus have rotated the fields by minus these amounts on this plane to orient the filaments vertically .",
    "the resulting column density maps are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vel - xi ] , where the vertical axis , labeled @xmath74 , is now approximately parallel to the filament .",
    "superposed on these maps , we show plots of the column density - weighted mean velocity perpendicular to the line - of - sight and approximately along the filament ( the vertical velocity in the projection of fig.[fig : vel - xi ] ) .",
    "this rendering clearly shows the large - scale collapse of the filament along its long dimension , signaled by the sharp transition ( jump ) from positive velocities in the lower region to negative velocities in the upper region .",
    "but in addition to this global collapse , smaller jumps in velocity associated to smaller - scale ( in size and mass ) centers of collapse are also observed .",
    "the collapsing regions move along the filament , as they follow the large - scale filament collapse , and so the velocity jumps around these regions are superposed on the average infall velocity towards the larger - scale center of mass .",
    "the velocity structure seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : vel - xi ] qualitatively resembles that observed in a number of observational studies .",
    "in particular , @xcite report a velocity gradient of @xmath80 pc@xmath81 across the filament associated with the embedded serpens south protocluster ( see their figure 4 ) , while @xcite report velocity gradients ranging between 0.22 and 0.63 @xmath82 pc@xmath81 across the filaments in sdc13 .",
    "although both the size and velocity scales of those filaments are smaller than ours , the velocity difference in our filaments , @xmath83 over length scales of @xmath84 pc , also corresponds to a gradient @xmath85 pc@xmath81 .",
    "these results are only preliminary , and a survey of the filaments produced in our simulations should be carried out , but the qualitative similarity between our results and the observations is encouraging .",
    "as mentioned above , the filaments are not depleted in a free - fall time ( see  [ sec : ident ] ) as they fall onto the local collapse centers ( the clumps ) within them because the filaments themselves are accreting material from their surroundings .",
    "this infall of material occurs at lower densities than that of the filaments , and so the infall and the dense filament might not be both observable with the same molecular species .",
    "nevertheless , we report here the accretion structure in the hope that it can be ultimately compared with that of observed filaments .     so that the line - of - sight is approximately perpendicular to the filament and the @xmath74 coordinate is measured along the filament .",

    "the velocity in this case is along the line of sight ( los ) , and denoted @xmath89 . while gas with @xmath90 forms a continuous structure along the filament , gas with @xmath91 breaks into four separate structures , enclosed by dotted ellipses in fig .",

    "that is , this change of direction happens as the gas density increases .",
    "therefore , when considering the velocity component perpendicular to the filament ( @xmath89 in fig .",
    "[ fig : posvel ] ) , gas in different density regimes should separate in velocity space .",
    "this is noticeable in figure [ fig : posvel ] as a clear separation of the gas in these regimes ( red and green images in the online version ) , with only a small superposition ( visible as a yellow area in the online version ) , with exception of the disk near the center , where the nature of the gas flow is different from the rest of the filament .",
    "the structure seen in figure [ fig : posvel ] is remarkably similar to that observed by @xcite in molecular line emission from the dr21 massive filament in the cygnus x region , which has a length @xmath40 pc , very similar to that of the filaments we analyze .",
    "@xcite conclude that the kinematics of the gas is consistent with a global gravitational collapse and inflow onto the filament , in agreement with the dynamical state of our filaments .",
    "furthermore , they show , in their figure 6 , a position - velocity diagram for several molecular transitions that closely resembles our figure [ fig : posvel ] .",
    "in particular , a separation of different density regimes in velocity space , which in our simulation corresponds to gas falling onto the filament , is observed in their figure 6 .",
    "moreover , the structure in their filament also exhibits significant widenings in the velocity coordinate , of amplitude several @xmath82 , at the location of clumps . in our simulation , these widenings are the result of the large infall velocities that develop in the vicinity of the clumps .",
    "these similarities strongly suggest that the filament studied by @xcite is indeed produced , like the filaments in our simulation , by gravitational collapse .     in the directions perpendicular ( _ dots _ ) and parallel ( _ crosses _ ) to the filament .",
    "dotted vertical lines show column densities corresponding to radii @xmath95 and @xmath96 ( _ right to left _ ) , according to the fit to the column density profile discussed in ",
    "[ sec : profile ] . at @xmath97 ,",
    "the filament s radius can not be derived from the column density profile fit .",
    "the structures at column densities larger than these are isolated clumps , rather than part of the fitted filament radial column density profile . the perpendicular accretion may be fitted by @xmath98 ( _ solid line_).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    figure [ fig : accretion ] shows the projected accretion rate onto filament 2 , defined as the flux across a contour defined by a given column density value ( integrated along the line - of - sight approximately perpendicular to the filament described above ) .",
    "shown are both the flux across longitudinal contour segments ( the flux perpendicular to the filament ; filled circles ) and across a contour segment perpendicular to the filament ( the flux along the filament ; plus signs ) . as mentioned above , the filament accretes gas mainly in the direction perpendicular to it .",
    "but , since the filament itself is falling onto the clump at the same time it is accreting , the inflow parallel to the filament , although small , is non - negligible .",
    "for example , at a threshold density of @xmath99 , the flux along the filament is a factor of @xmath84 smaller than the perpendicular accretion . in the scenario",
    "pictured above , this should not be surprising : the filament flows along its long direction , but keeps being replenished by its envelope .",
    "so , at a surface defined solely by a column density value there will be flux due to both accretion ( mainly perpendicular ) onto the filament as well as flux ( parallel ) corresponding to infall due to the collapse of the filament as a whole .",
    "the accretion rate along the filament becomes comparable to the perpendicular one at @xmath100 .",
    "this may be understood in terms of mass conservation , since the filament is not a hydrostatic structure , but rather , a flow feature , so that all the mass that accretes perpendicularly to the filament must eventually flow away in the longitudinal direction . considering that the filament is @xmath101 long , its total perpendicular accretion rate is @xmath102 .        it has been suggested that filaments observed in molecular clouds might have a plummer - like profile in the direction perpendicular to the filament s long axis .",

    "they found that the filaments are well fitted for values of @xmath107 in the range @xmath110 , and a characteristic gaussian fwhm of @xmath111 , which corresponds to @xmath112 .",
    "we wish to compare the filaments in our simulation with the results of @xcite .",
    "however , this is not completely straightforward , as the column density structure around the filaments is far from being smooth , being instead significantly clumpy . also , the radial column density profile is in general asymmetric around the maximum . for example , in the lower - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fil2 ] , a moderate - density clump is observed at @xmath113 , which extends @xmath114 pc in the @xmath72-direction , while a protrusion is observed coming off the filament at @xmath115 .",
    "if a single plummer - like profile were to be fitted to the spatial column density distribution , these neighboring clumps would induce strong local variations in the fitted parameters of the column density profile namely the position of the density maximum ( the `` spine '' of the filament ) , the central density @xmath103 , the width @xmath104 , and the slope @xmath107 ) .    in order to minimize the impact of the irregularities , we have chosen to use a two - step fitting procedure , as follows .",

    "mean _ radial column density profile , with the averaging performed over both sides of this central position and along the filament s length .    .",

    "the best fit to this mean profile has @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 .",
    "this filament width is consistent with the filament data compiled by @xcite for a number of nearby star - forming regions .",
    "we also added a constant column density term to the model in order to account for the low density diffuse gas present in the simulation that is not observable in molecular line emision , but the resulting column density base is negligible ( @xmath122 ) and the fitted profile parameters change only marginally . in both cases ,",
    "the spread in column density profiles along the filament is much larger than the error in the fit .",
    "figure [ fig : profile ] also shows the fitted profile for the @xmath123 case , which corresponds to an isothermal cylinder in hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite . with the appropriate parameters ,",
    "a @xmath123 model can be fitted within the large spread in column density values .",
    "however , departures from the average profile show trends ( systematically below the mean profile in the constant core region , for example ) , suggesting a bad fit . also , since the @xmath123 model falls more rapidly than the mean profile , the fit is more sensitive to the constant column density term mentioned above ( in fact , this is the only case where a non - negligible column density base was returned by the fitting procedure , namely @xmath124 ) .",
    "regardless , a bad fit for a hydrostatic model should not be surprising given the dynamical nature of the filament in the simulation .",
    "in fact , fig .  [",
    "fig : profile ] also shows a fit with @xmath125 , which @xcite used to fit one of their filaments .",
    "it is seen that this value of @xmath107 provides a much better fit for our filament than the case @xmath123 , although the best fit is obtained for @xmath126 .",
    "fitting a column density profile of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) to filament 1 is less reliable than in the case of filament 2 since filament 1 bends and has more nearby small scale concentrations that skew the fit . nevertheless , considering only the gas below the disk ( @xmath127 ) and masking out the concentration at @xmath128 ( see left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : vel - xi ] ) , the fitting procedure yielded similar central density and core radius values ( @xmath129 and @xmath130 ) , although with a shallower profile ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "in contrast with observations , the numerical model yields the full spatial distribution of the gas , allowing us to explore the three dimensional structure of the filament . with this in mind , we repeated the above procedure but using a profile of the form of eq.([eq : plummer ] ) to fit the volume density distribution of the filament 2 .",
    "in this case , the two - step fit was performed at each @xmath74-position along the filament , this time considering the density field in a plane perpendicular to the @xmath74 coordinate .",
    "the fit was only performed if the maximum density on this plane , @xmath132 , satisfied @xmath133 .",
    "again , the main component is defined as that with larger central column density ( the product @xmath134 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : two_fils ] shows the fitted parameters along the filament .",
    "the fitting procedure returns continuous positions for the center of the main component along the filament , suggesting that it is reasonably well defined by the fit .",
    "but it is noteworthy that the distribution of centers of the secondary component , although not really continuous , tends to agglomerate to the right of the main component .",
    "this behavior is also present in the distribution of @xmath103 and @xmath107-values along the filament .",
    "we envision two possible interpretations .",
    "one is that the filament is really a bundle of smaller filaments , as proposed by @xcite for filaments in the taurus region , that may be separated in velocity space .",
    "another interpretation , which we find more plausible , is that the filament is not symmetric and so , using a symmetric form for the fit ( either in real or in velocity space ) , artificially yields multiple , displaced components .",
    "this lack of symmetry is suggested by the skewed velocities in figure [ fig : posvel ] .        with the center of the filament defined by the main component , we may average to obtain a ( cylindrically symmetric ) density and velocity profiles characteristic of the filament .",
    "such profiles are shown in figure [ fig : rad_profile ] . as the gas is accreated into the filament ,",
    "the radially inflowing velocity changes direction , turning the gas motion into a flow along the filament . it does not appear to happen abruptly ( through a shock , for example ) , but in a smooth way .",
    "this change in the flow direction is apparent also in figures [ fig : fil1 ] and [ fig : fil2 ] .    following @xcite , the averaged radial density profile",
    "was then fitted by a single plummer - like shape . in this case",
    ", the best single - component fit has parameters @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 .",
    "this value of @xmath107 implies a shallower volume density profile than the corresponding column density one .",
    "this is , however , to be expected , as the column density , seen in projection , increases towards the central axis of the filament due to the combined effects of a larger volume density at the central axis and of a longer integration path there .",
    "nevertheless , without the smoothing effect provided by the line - of - sight integration , the spread in values in the volume density profiles is much larger than in the column density case .",
    "this sends a warning that the actual three - dimensional structure of observed filaments may be significantly more disordered and chaotic than what might be inferred from fits to the column density , which constitutes a los - average , and are furthermore averaged along the length of the filament .",
    "our analysis is not free of caveats and limitations .",
    "first , we only analyzed two filaments , as a proof - of - concept , and only at a single typical scale , although filaments at different size and mass scales are apparent in the simulation . in the future",
    ", we plan to perform a systematic survey - like study , applying an automated filament - detection algorithm , which should allow us to obtain significant statistics and investigate scaling properties .",
    "second , our simulations have omitted a number of physical processes , most notably magnetic fields and stellar feedback .",
    "in particular , the omission of stellar feedback implies that our study should be applicable only to the early evolutionary stages of the filament - clump system . on the other hand , magnetic fields",
    "have been suggested to have an important role in the formation and structuring of filaments , so a study analogous to the one we have presented here should be performed including magnetic fields .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that our filaments compare reasonable well with observations suggests that the magnetic field may only play a relatively minor role .    )",
    ".,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    third , it is important to estimate the level at which our filamentary structures are resolved .",
    "this can be done as follows .",
    "a standard resolution criterion with sph is that the minimally - resolved mass is twice that contained within a smoothing length .",
    "our simulation employed 40 neighbors to define the smoothing length .",
    "given the sph particle mass of @xmath138 ( cf .",
    " [ sec : model ] ) , then , the minimally - resolved mass is @xmath139 . to determine a corresponding size scale at a given density",
    ", we consider the radius of a sphere containing this mass at the specified density , given by @xmath140 .",
    "figure [ fig : resol ] shows the scaling of @xmath141 with density .",
    "this can be compared with the size scales determined for our filaments in  [ sec : profile ] .",
    "there , we found that the _ column _ density profiles were well fitted by @xmath142 pc and @xmath14323 @xmath144 . by comparison , we see from fig .  [",
    "fig : resol ] that , at @xmath145 , @xmath146 pc , so that the fitted central scale is roughly twice the minimum resolved scale , and we can consider that this fit is safely resolved .    on the other hand , also in ",
    "[ sec : model ] , we found that the _ volume _ density profile was fitted with @xmath147 pc and @xmath148 .",
    "for comparison , we see from fig .  [",
    "fig : resol ] that , at @xmath149 , @xmath150 pc , so in this case the fit is only marginally resolved .",
    "thus , we can not rule out the possibility that the characteristic width of our filaments may be limited by resolution .",
    "nevertheless , despite the relative simplicity and resolution limitations of the simulations presented here , the fact that a simulation originally designed to study a different phenomenon ( the evolution of the star formation activity before feedback dominates ) yields filaments similar to observed ones suggests that the dominant physical processes involved in the filament dynamics are present in the simulation .",
    "we performed sph simulations of the formation of a molecular cloud from a convergent flow of diffuse gas .",
    "as in previous works , the resulting cloud is highly dynamic and , due to hydrodynamic and thermal instabilities , becoming turbulent and rapidly fragmenting into substructure . nevertheless , the `` turbulent '' motions are unable to stabilize the cloud and soon its dynamics becomes dominated by gravity , and the cloud begins to collapse . however , because the cloud continues to accrete , its mass continues to grow , and soon it contains a large number of jeans masses @xcite .",
    "this naturally leads to the formation of filaments , since the multi - jeans mass flow behaves similarly to a pressureless flow , which is known to collapse along its shortest dimension first @xcite , so that the initially planar cloud collapses onto filaments , which then collapse into clumps .",
    "the filaments are not equilibrium structures at all , and instead are highly dynamical .",
    "they can be considered intermediate steps of the cloud s collapse , constituting channels through which the gas is funneled from the extended cloud onto the clumps .",
    "these filaments are the loci of colliding streams on the parent planar structures , where the flow gets reoriented and directed towards its final destination  the clumps within the filaments , which have conditions appropriate for star formation .",
    "it is important to remark that the filaments developing in our simulation arise self - consistently from the fragmentation of the cloud initially formed by the convergence of warm gas streams by the combined action of various instabilities @xcite . in particular",
    ", thermal instability produces small , cold clumps that grow by the accretion of warm gas as well as by merging with other clumps @xcite , until they finally become gravitationally unstable and begin to collapse .",
    "thus , our simulation differs fundamentally from simulations of _ fourier - generated _ turbulence in the multi - phase medium , in which the external velocity field is constructed in fourier space and is applied everywhere in space .",
    "the latter method allows precise control of the driving scale , the amplitude , and nature ( ratio of solenoidal to compressible energy ) of the applied force , albeit at the expense that the driving is applied as a body force rather than as a surface stress , as corresponds to the kind of energy sources present in the ism , such as outflows and expanding shells .",
    "instead , in our simulation , the characteristic ( or `` energy - containing '' ) scale of the turbulence , as well as the amplitude and ratio of solenoidal to compressible , develop self - consistently from the instabilities in the compressed layer , and we have no control over these parameters .    under these conditions , in our simulation , the gravitational collapse in the individual centers ( modeled with sink particles ) , is not instantaneous but starts @xmath151 into the simulation and continues well after the filaments finish to accrete onto the clumps .",
    "moreover , the filaments themselves are falling into the largest - scale potential well , generating new structures that eventually merge into each other , forming a larger - scale hub - filament system towards the end of the simulation .    the simulation presented here formed two prominent filaments , each with @xmath152 out to radii @xmath5 , and lengths @xmath65 , implying linear mass densities @xmath153 .",
    "we furthermore studied the radial density and column density profiles of such filaments , finding that the column density profile is reasonably well fitted by a plummer - like profile , whose best - fit parameters are @xmath154 and @xmath155 . in turn , the three - dimensional radial density distribution was best fitted with @xmath156 and @xmath157 , although this fit was less certain because in the three - dimensional measurement no averaging along the los is made .",
    "these values are qualitatively consistent with observational results .",
    "for example , @xcite find that their sample of filaments in the aquila region have linear mass densities @xmath158 , while @xcite find that their filaments typically have plummer - type column density radial profiles with @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "these authors speculate that their filaments may form as the result of the dissipation of large - scale turbulence , because their characteristic thickness is similar to that of the sonic scale , below which the `` turbulence '' becomes subsonic .",
    "however , in our case , the filaments are not a result of turbulence nor their thickness is the result of having dissipated the turbulence .",
    "instead , they are an intermediate stage of the gravitational collapse , funneling gas to the local collapse centers  the clumps  and their thickness appears to be the result of the force balance between the radial pressure gradient in the filament and the combined thermal plus ram pressure of the gas falling onto the filament , the whole system maintained in a stationary state thanks to the `` drainage '' and reorientation of the infalling material towards the trough of the gravitational potential well , located at the clumps accreting from the filaments .",
    "we plan to will explore this scenario in a future study .",
    "we also measured the accretion rates perpendicular ( onto ) and parallel ( along ) the filament .",
    "the rates are not unique , but instead depend on the radial position along the filament .",
    "because of the column density profile , this translates into a column density dependence of the accretion rates . we found that , as the column density varies from @xmath161 to @xmath162 , the accretion rate per unit length perpendicular to the filament ( i.e. , onto it ) ranges between 2 and 20 @xmath163 , while the linear accretion density from the filament onto the clump ranges between 0.3 and 30 @xmath164 .",
    "considering that the filament is @xmath0 long , its total perpendicular accretion rate is @xmath102 .",
    "our measured accretion rates , which peak at 23@xmath165 , are at least half an order of magnitude lower than those inferred by @xcite , although their estimate was an indirect one , assuming that the characteristic timescale for the process of moving the material along the filament is equal to that of the lifetime of the protostellar objects being formed in the clumps , @xmath10 yr .",
    "this is a rather uncertain assumption , which may overestimate the accretion rate estimate . on the other hand , our total measured accretion rate of @xmath102 matches very well that inferred by @xcite ( @xmath166 ) .",
    "however , the filament they studied was at a much smaller ( sub - pc ) scale , and therefore the comparison may not be conclusive .",
    "we conclude from our results that the process of hierarchical ( i.e. , multi - scale ) and chaotic ( i.e. , disordered ) gravitational fragmentation produces filaments that have physical conditions and accretion rates that are qualitatively similar to those found in recent observational studies , suggesting that this mechanism may indeed be responsible for their formation . however , more systematic studies need to be performed where the mass and size scales of the filaments in both the observations and simulations are better matched , in order to determine whether in this case their radial column density profiles and accretion rates match at the quantitative level .",
    "we plan to perform such a study in the near future .",
