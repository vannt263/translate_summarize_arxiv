    "the beginning of twentieth century launched a series of major paradigm shifts which heralded the era of modern physics .",
    "it will perhaps be surprising to the modern reader that in the advent of the revolutionary einsteinian theory of relativity , maxwell and boltzmann s kinetic theory and planck s hypothesis of quanta , the scientific world was not convinced of the fact that matter is grainy and can not be continuously divided ad infinitum  @xcite .",
    "the seed of doubt was planted by the renowned scottish botanist , robert brown , who noticed in 1827 that pollen in water suspension which he examined under his microscope displayed a very rapid , irregular , zigzag motion .",
    "the mystery of the `` vital force '' driving the brownian motions remained unsolved for nearly 80 years , evading the pincer of conventional physics .",
    "the answer came from einstein and smoluchowski , who showed how the behaviour of mechanical objects is driven by the statistical properties of thermal noise , postulating the existence of molecules in the fluid and linking the diffusion strength of their motion to the friction acting on a body moving in the fluid  @xcite .",
    "the explanation of brown s experiments , being at the same time a major diversion from the `` continuous '' newtonian dynamics forming the core of the contemporary physics , opened a whole new avenue of research into the behaviour of systems influenced with random noise , resulting in such fundamental discoveries as the fluctuation - dissipation theorem  @xcite . since that time",
    ", dissipation has been shown to affect such key dynamical processes as electron transfer and transport , surface dynamics , quantum tunneling , control and nonadiabatic effects .",
    "more generally , scientists in many disciplines , from physics through biology to social sciences , have developed increasingly powerful methods of modelling _ open systems _",
    ", which interact with their environment .    in many nano - scale systems",
    "the noise influencing the dynamics arises from quantum fluctuations . already in 1928 ,",
    "when nyquist proposed the fluctuation - dissipation theorem  @xcite , the quantum fluctuations were treated differently than the classical ones : the energy @xmath0 from the classical equipartition law was replaced by the thermally averaged energy of a quantum harmonic oscillator , a distinction becoming negligible at high temperatures .",
    "this result has been followed by the development of the new branch of physics , the theory of _ open quantum systems _",
    "it has found applications in almost all areas of natural sciences  @xcite , from quantum optics  @xcite , through condensed matter physics  @xcite , nanotechnology  @xcite and spintronics  @xcite , through quantum information  @xcite , through chemistry  @xcite , to biology  @xcite or even stochastic gravity and inflationary cosmology  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has implications for such fundamental problems as the quantum measurement theory  @xcite and the emergence of classicality due to decoherence  @xcite",
    ".    there exists a rich variety of methods of modelling open quantum systems , applicable to different physical regimes and based on different approximation techniques  @xcite . in general , these methods are difficult to apply to large systems or arbitrary spectral densities . in this paper",
    "we propose a new method , which describes finite - dimensional quantum systems up to a moderately large size ( ca 50 basis states on a standard pc ) , interacting with non - markovian quantum harmonic oscillator baths : from single modes to continuous spectra , as well as a wide range of interaction strengths , while having moderate computational requirements .",
    "the non - markovianity is necessary to quantitatively analyse the properties of many physical systems encountered in the fields mentioned in the previous paragraph  @xcite .",
    "the proposed method handles large or infinite baths and a wide range of interaction strengths , while having moderate computational requirements .",
    "it uses the heisenberg picture , which makes it particularly easy to focus the attention on the system degrees of freedom while preserving the decoherence effects due to the coupling to the bath , and conserving the total energy .    in the following section we will remind shortly the theoretical background of our work and lay out the employed formalism ( secs.[sec : open - qs ] and  [ sec : dynamics - heisenberg ] ) . next we will present the derivation of the reduced operator approximation approach ( sec.[sec : roa ] ) and propose its two variants : low and high - order in the systems and bath operators .",
    "they will be optimised for typical cases of continuous and lorentzian baths in sec.[sec : baths ] . in sec.[sec : examples ] we will present the results of our method and compare it to other known techniques of modelling open quantum systems , like the pseudomode method or the quantum state diffusion .",
    "section[sec : summary ] contains a short summary of our work .",
    "most generally , an open quantum system is a subsystem of a larger , interacting quantum system , e.g.  one of the photons in an epr pair , an atom in a resonant cavity , a quantum dot interacting with phonons in the crystal or any real object `` becoming classical '' through scattering of a vast number of air molecules and photons on it .",
    "we consider the case of a finite - dimensional quantum system coupled to an infinite - dimensional quantum bath , composed of a possibly infinite number of modes .",
    "in such an asymmetrical setup it is natural to ignore the details of the bath dynamics and focus on the dynamics of the reduced density matrix of the system . in this chapter",
    "we derive it using the proposed reduced operator approximation approach .",
    "we consider a quantum system represented in an @xmath1-dimensional hilbert space @xmath2 spanned by basis states @xmath3 , and a space of linear operators on @xmath2 , denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "its internal dynamics is described by the hamiltonian @xmath5 , @xmath6 where @xmath7 are transition operators between the states @xmath8 and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the interstate couplings , @xmath11 . in a more concise notation",

    "since @xmath19 can be embedded in @xmath4 as @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 is the identity operator on @xmath2 ) , the matrix product between @xmath22 and @xmath13 can be defined , with values in @xmath13 .",

    "hermitian conjugation in @xmath13 is defined as @xmath29 . in the case of @xmath30",
    ", this leads to @xmath31 , since @xmath32 .",
    "the system is coupled to a quantum bath composed of a collection of @xmath33 independent harmonic oscillators living in an infinite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath34 and described by the hamiltonian @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the annihilation operator of the @xmath37-th mode ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the coupling between the system and the bath is described by the operator @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are @xmath42 diagonal matrices describing the coupling of the @xmath37-th bath mode with the system , @xmath43 .",
    "the fact that each @xmath44 matrix is diagonal means that the bath does not induce transitions between system basis states .",
    "however , the matrix notation allows for an easy generalisation of the model to include such bath - induced transitions .",
    "the total hamiltonian , generating the evolution of the system and bath in the schrdinger picture , is given by @xmath45 in the traditional `` index '' notation , @xmath46 has the form @xmath47    the reduced matrix density of the system , @xmath48 , is defined as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the density matrix of the system and the bath as a whole , and the trace @xmath51 goes over the bath degrees of freedom only , @xmath52 . in the @xmath8 basis , @xmath53 \\,,\\ ] ] where the trace is taken over both system and bath degrees of freedom .",

    "however , a numerical description of both types of operators in the total system and bath basis is impossible , as @xmath92 is infinite - dimensional .    according to eq .  ,",
