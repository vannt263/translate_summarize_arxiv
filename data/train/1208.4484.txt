    "a _ robot swarm _ @xcite is a system of multiple autonomous mobile robots engaged in some collective task . in hostile environments , it may be desirable to employ large groups of low cost robots to perform various tasks cooperatively .",

    "multiple robot path planning , moving to ( and maintaining ) formation and pattern generation are some important geometric problems in swarm robotics",
    ". multiple robot path planning may deal with problems like finding non - intersecting paths for mobile robots @xcite .",
    "the formation and marching problems require multiple robots to form up and move in a specified pattern .",
    "these problems are also interesting in terms of distributed algorithms .",
    "formation and marching problems may act as useful primitives for larger tasks , like , moving a large object by a group of robots @xcite or distributed sensing @xcite .",
    "pattern generation in cellular robotic systems ( crs ) @xcite is related to pattern formation problem by mobile robots .",
    "this paper addresses a very well known and challenging problem involving robot swarms , namely _ gathering_. the objective is to collect multiple autonomous mobile robots into a point or a small region .",
    "the choice of the point is not fixed in advance .",
    "initially the robots are stationary and in arbitrary positions .",
    "gathering problem is also referred to as _ point formation _ , _ convergence _ , _ homing _ or _ rendezvous _ @xcite .",
    "a pragmatic view of swarm robots asks for distributed environment .",
    "several interesting works have been carried out by researchers @xcite on distributed algorithms for mobile robots . a simple basic model called _ weak model _",
    "@xcite is popular in the literature .",
    "the world of the robots consists of the infinite plane and multiple robots living on it .",
    "the robots were considered dimensionless or points .",
    "all robots are autonomous , homogeneous and perform the same algorithm ( _ look - compute - move _ cycle ) @xcite . in _",
    "look _ state , a robot takes a snapshot of its surroundings , within its range of vision .",
    "it then executes an algorithm for computing the destination in _ compute _ state .",
    "the algorithm is same for all robots . in _ move _ state , the robot moves to the computed destination .",
    "the robots are oblivious ( memoryless ) .",
    "they do not preserve any data computed in the previous cycles .",
    "there is no explicit communication between the robots .",
    "the robots coordinate by means of observing the positions of the other robots on the plane .",
    "a robot is always able to see another robot within its visibility radius or range ( may be infinite ) .",
    "two different models have been used for robots movement @xcite . under the sym model ,",
    "the movement of a robot was considered to be instantaneous , i.e. , when a robot is moving , other robots can not see it . later , that model has been modified to corda model where the movement of a robot is not instantaneous .",
    "a robot in motion is visible .",
    "the corda model is a better representation of the real world .",
    "the robots may or may not be synchronized .",
    "synchronous robots execute their cycles together .",
    "in such a system , all robots get the same view . as a result",
    ", they compute on same data . in the more practical asynchronous model",
    ", there is no such guarantee . by the time a robot completes its computation ,",
    "several of the robots may have moved from the positions based on which the computation is made .",
    "the robots may have a common coordinate system or individual coordinate systems having no common orientation or scale @xcite .",
    "the problem of gathering multiple robots has been studied on the basic model of robotic system with different additional assumptions .",
    "prencipe @xcite observed that gathering is not always possible for asynchronous robots .",
    "however , instead of meeting at a single point , if the robots are asked to move very close to each other , then the problem can be solved by computing the center of gravity of all robots and moving the robots towards it . under the weak model ,",
    "robots do not have any memory .",
    "as they work asynchronously and act independently , once a robot moves towards the center of gravity , the center of gravity also changes . moving towards center of gravity does not gather robots to a single point .",
    "however , this method makes sure that the robots can be brought as close as one may wish .",
    "a possible solution to this problem is to choose a point which , unlike center of gravity , is invariant with respect to robots movement .",
    "one such point in the plane is the point which minimizes the sum of distance between itself and all the robots .",
    "this point is called the _ weber or fermat or torricelli _ point .",
    "it does not change during the robots movement , if the robots move only towards this point .",
    "however , the _ weber _ point is not computable for higher number of robots ( greater than 4 ) @xcite .",
    "thus , this approach also can not be used to solve the gathering problem . if common coordinate system is assumed , instead of individual coordinate systems , then the gathering problem is solvable even with limited visibility @xcite . if the robots are synchronous and their movements are instantaneous , then the gathering problem is solvable even with limited visibility @xcite .",
    "cieliebak et al .",
    "@xcite , show that there are solutions for gathering without synchronicity if the visibility is unlimited .",
    "one approach is by _ multiplicity _ detection .",
    "if multiple robots are at the same point then the point is said to have _ strict multiplicity_. however , the problem is not solvable for _ two _ robots even with _ multiplicity _ detection @xcite .",
    "there are some solutions for _ three _ and _ four _ robots . for more than _ four _ robots , there are two algorithms with restricted sets of initial configurations @xcite . in the first algorithm ,",
    "the robots are initially in a _ bi - angular configuration_. in such a configuration , there exists a point @xmath3 and two angles @xmath4 and @xmath5 such that the angle between any two adjacent robots is either @xmath4 or @xmath5 and the angles alternate .",
    "the second algorithm works if the initial configuration of the robots do not form any regular @xmath0-gon .",
    "prencipe @xcite reported that there exists no deterministic oblivious algorithm that solves the gathering problem in a finite number of cycles for a set of @xmath6 robots .",
    "_ convergence _ of multiple robots is studied by peleg and cohen @xcite and they proposed a gravitational algorithm in fully asynchronous model for convergence of any number of robots .",
    "a dimensionless robot is unrealistic .",
    "czyzowicz et al.,@xcite extend the weak model by replacing the point robots by unit disc robots .",
    "they called these robots as _",
    "fat robots_. the methods of gathering of three and four fat robots have been described by them .",
    "the paper considers partial visibility and presents several procedures to avoid different situations which cause obstacles to gathering .",
    "we proposed a deterministic gathering algorithm for @xmath0 @xmath1 fat robots @xcite .",
    "the robots are assumed to be transparent in order to achieve full visibility .",
    "having _ fat robots _ , we first define the _ gathering pattern _ to be formed by the robots .",
    "therefore , _ gathering pattern _ formation becomes a special case of _ pattern formation _ of mobile robots which is also a challenging problem for mobile robots .",
    "recent works @xcite shows that pattern formation and leader election are equivalent for @xmath2 robots .",
    "however , this work @xcite considered the robots to have common handedness or chirality .",
    "we propose a gathering algorithm which assumes no chirality and use the leader election technique in order to form gathering pattern .",
    "we also show that if leader election is possible then formation of the _ gathering pattern _ is possible even with no chirality .",

    "all other robots remain stationary till the designated robot reaches its destination . at each turn , the robot selected for motion is chosen in such a way , that during the motion if any other robot takes a snapshot and computes , this particular robot would be the only one eligible for movement . to implement this",
    ", we choose a destination carefully .",
    "the robot , nearest to the destination , is allowed to move first . however",
    ", a problem will occur when multiple robots are at same distance from the destination .",
    "a leader election mechanism is required to select a robot among such multiple eligible robots . to overcome this problem",

    "<S> this paper proposes a distributed algorithm which deterministically gathers @xmath0 @xmath1 asynchronous , fat robots . the robots are assumed to be transparent and they have full visibility . </S>",
    "<S> since the robots are unit discs , they can not overlap ; we define a _ gathering pattern _ for them . the robots are initially considered to be stationary . </S>",
    "<S> a robot is visible in its motion . </S>",
    "<S> the robots do not store past actions . </S>",
    "<S> they are anonymous and can not be distinguished by their appearances and do not have common coordinate system or chirality . </S>",

    "<S> algorithm one robot moves at a time towards its destination . </S>",
    "<S> the robot which moves , is selected in such a way that , it will be the only robot eligible to move , until it reaches its destination . in case of a tie , </S>",
    "<S> this paper proposes a _ </S>",
    "<S> leader election _ algorithm which produces an ordering of the robots and the first robot in the ordering becomes the leader . </S>",
    "<S> the ordering is unique in the sense that , each robot , characterized by its location , agrees on the same ordering . </S>",
    "<S> we show that if a set of robots can be ordered then they can gather deterministically . </S>",
    "<S> the paper also characterizes the cases , where ordering is not possible .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper also presents an important fact that , if leader election is possible then _ gathering pattern _ formation is possible even with no chirality . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that , pattern formation and leader election are equivalent , for @xmath2 robots when the robots agree on chirality . </S>",
    "<S> this paper proposes an algorithm for formation of the _ gathering pattern _ for transparent fat robots without chirality .    </S>",
