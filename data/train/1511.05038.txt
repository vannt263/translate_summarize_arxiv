    "the calder project  @xcite aims to develop wide area light detectors ( 25  @xmath0 ) with noise energy resolution @xmath2  ev by implementing phonon - mediated kinetic inductance detectors ( kids )  @xcite .",
    "the objective of the first phase of the project is the production of a 2x2  @xmath3 si substrate sampled by four 40  nm thick al film lumped - element resonators as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , with an energy resolution of about 100  ev .",
    "the detectors are operated in a @xmath4he/@xmath5he dilution refrigerator with base temperature of 10  mk and are permanently exposed to a @xmath6 source . with",
    "a 400  nm led light source and an optical fiber that drives the light signals to the detector substrate it is also possible to illuminate the detectors with optical pulses .",
    "the output signals that excited the resonators are fed into a citlf4 sige cryogenic low noise amplifier  @xcite operated at 4  k. a detailed description of the chip design , the cryogenic setup , the room temperature electronics and the acquisition software can be found in refs  @xcite .",
    "the acquired signals are digitized and saved on disk for the off - line analysis .",
    "the first step of the detectors characterization is the evaluation of the resonators parameters : the resonant frequencies ( @xmath7 ) and the internal ( @xmath8 ) and coupling ( @xmath9 ) quality factors .",
    "the knowledge of these quantities is fundamental not only for the resonator characterization but also for the detector response study and its absolute energy calibration as described in ref .",
    "the transmitted signal ( @xmath10 ) for an ideal kid can be written as : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the total quality factor of the resonator . at frequencies",
    "@xmath13 or @xmath14 , @xmath10 is close to 1 and the feed - line is unaffected by the resonator .",
    "when @xmath15 sweeps through the resonance , @xmath10 traces out a circle in the in - phase quadrature ( iq ) plane with diameter equal to @xmath16 which is referred to as the resonance circle : at the resonant frequency @xmath17 the circle crosses the real axis at the closest approach to the origin , @xmath18 . in this ideal case",
    "the resonance parameters evaluation is quite simple .",
    "nevertheless , in real measurements there are deviations from the ideal response caused by the read - out chain , by the impedance mismatch between the feed - line and the chip and the power dissipated on the resonator that lead to a translation , rotation , magnification and distortion of the resonance circle , which complicates the evaluation of @xmath7 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 :    * the read - out chain introduces an electronic time delay @xmath22 and a distortion in the iq plane introduced by the iq - mixer , which is in the most general case an ellipse arc with axis @xmath23 and @xmath24 and center @xmath25 , rotated by an angle @xmath26 ; * the impedance mismatches in proximity of the kids produce a rotation and magnification of the resonance circle that can be represented using only one parameter @xmath27",
    "@xcite ; * the power absorbed by the resonator introduces an asymmetry in the resonance shape and a left shift in the resonant frequency @xmath7 .",
    "it is possible to account for this effect performing the substitution @xmath28 in eq .",
    "[ eqtrans ] .",
    "the new variable @xmath29 can be written as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 , and the parameter @xmath32 quantify the resonance asymmetry ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .    in this work",
    "each of these effects is taken into account simultaneously with the following equation : @xmath33 where 7 parameters describe the feed - line contribution @xmath34 ) , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath22 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and 4 parameters the resonator properties @xmath7 , @xmath21 , @xmath20 and @xmath32 .",
    "+ the @xmath35 complex function was fitted in the ( i , q,@xmath15 ) space by minimizing the square modulus of the difference between the function and the data points : @xmath36 fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows two examples of the @xmath35 function evaluated by fitting one resonance circle of two different chips ; in the second one a higher impedance mismatch occurs between the feed - line and the chip : the resonance parameters are estimated despite the huge distortion caused by the mismatch .",
    "the detectors are operated in the most sensitive point , where the signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath37 ) is maximum . in order to find this working point each detector",
    "is characterized performing a scan of the input power : for each microwave input power the average signal and the average noise power spectrum are acquired .",
    "the average pulse is evaluated exploiting the signals produced by the optical system .",
    "they are acquired for the real and imaginary parts of each resonator ( i and q ) and then converted into changes in phase @xmath38 and amplitude relative to the center of the resonance loop . since the @xmath38 signal is @xmath39 times larger than the amplitude one only the @xmath38 signals are used in the analysis .",
    "+ the @xmath38 pulse obtained averaging hundred events produced by optical pulse interactions within the substrate are shown for several microwave input powers in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] : since the decay time decreases increasing the microwave input power it has been identified with the quasi - particle life - time @xmath40 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "the decrease of @xmath40 produces as a consequence a decrease in the signal integration length but , on the other hand , increasing the input power produces a reduction of the noise contribution from the amplifier , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] _ right_. the flat noise observed in the high frequency region of the phase read - out is consistent with the noise temperature of the amplifier ( @xmath41  k ) .",
    "the low - frequency region of the phase spectra is dominated by another noise source , whose origin is under investigation .",
    "the signal evaluated using the maximum of the average pulses , the noise evaluated integrating the average noise power spectrum filtered with the optimum filter algorithm  @xcite , and its ratio ( @xmath37 ) as function of the microwave power for one resonator are shown in fig  [ fig3 ] : for this particular resonator the maximum in @xmath37 is obtained for an input power equal to -58  dbm .",
    "since the final purpose is the cherenkov light detection , the response to 400  nm optical pulses is studied . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite the energy absorbed by the resonator and the phase signal integral @xmath42 are related by a calibration function that allows to perform an absolute energy calibration of the detector . using that procedure the energy of the incident",
    "light pulses can be evaluated and compared with the nominal one : the optical system was previously calibrated at room temperature with a pmt and exploiting a monte carlo simulation that takes into account the pmt quantum efficiency , the reflectivity of silicon  @xcite , and the geometrical efficiency of the set - up .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ fig4 ] demonstrate the validity of the absolute energy calibration process , and at the same time the linear response of the detector for energy depositions up to 30  kev .",
    "in this work the analysis tools developed for the characterization of the first calder aluminum array on si substrate are presented .",
    "a model for the measurement of the resonance parameters able to account for all the effects caused by a non - ideal experimental set - up was developed .",
    "the technique for the selection of the optimal detectors point operation ( maximum of @xmath37 ) was discussed .",
    "finally the capability to reconstruct the energy deposition of optical photon pulses with wavelength of 400  nm was demonstrated ."
