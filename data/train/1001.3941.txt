    "a crystal in equilibrium against its vapor or a melt eventually reaches a shape which can be obtained by the wulff construction @xcite : let the free energy per unit area of a plane surface of the crystal which is perpendicular to a unit vector @xmath3 be given by @xmath4 .",
    "we define the points @xmath5 for some fixed constant of proportionality which eventually sets the size of the crystal .",
    "next we construct a plane through each @xmath6 , perpendicular to @xmath3 .",
    "the wulff shape of the crystal is the inner envelope of all such planes .    from the terrace - ledge - kink ( tlk )",
    "@xcite model we expect the surface free energy of a crystal to have cusp - like minima near to the crystallographic symmetry directions : for a plane oriented at a small angle @xmath7 to a crystallographic axis ( i.e. a ` vicinal plane ' ) and at absolute temperature @xmath8 , the surface free energy per unit area behaves like @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the free energy per unit area of a molecularly flat surface with @xmath11 , while @xmath12 is the ledge energy per molecule and @xmath13 is a molecular distance .    using the wulff construction , this leads to the emergence of crystal facets at equilibrium , in which a macroscopic portion of the crystal surface is molecularly flat , save for isolated single molecule islands and surface vacancies @xcite .",
    "however , at a particular temperature ( the ` equilibrium roughening ' or ` surface melting ' temperature ) , the free energy barrier to formation of new molecular islands on the facet vanishes ; the facets become rough on a molecular scale , so that the relevant cusp in the surface free energy disappears along with the facet , to be replaced by a macroscopically smooth , rounded crystal surface @xcite .",
    "this roughening transition is different for different crystallographic symmetry directions ; for example three different temperatures have been observed for helium crystals @xcite , while for ice , the basal facet persists up until melting , while prism planes roughen at @xmath14c when against vapor @xcite or @xmath15c when against water under pressure @xcite . if the crystal surface is not at equilibrium , but instead growing , this can move the roughening transition to lower temperatures @xcite .    in this investigation",
    ", we start from two assumptions : first , we assume that all the relevant crystallographic planes are roughened ( there may however be other directions not involved in the analysis described below , which are faceted ) .",
    "second , we make the approximation that the roughened portion of a crystal surface has a fairly isotropic surface free energy per unit area @xmath16 ( a typical approximation for phase - field studies of dendritic growth @xcite or solvability theory @xcite ) .",
    "when a roughened crystal does not have its wulff shape , then the surface free energy will not be equal everywhere .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath17 of a molecule at a curved surface differs from the value @xmath18 it would have for a flat surface by the well known gibbs - thomson equation , which in linearized form gives @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the molecular volume and @xmath21 is the mean curvature of the surface ( positive if the surface is convex ) .",
    "molecules will therefore have a tendency to leave convex portions of the surface and attach to concave ( or less convex ) regions .",
    "in doing so , they may either travel through the bulk of the material outside the crystal , in a process of evaporation - condensation ( or solution - precipitation for a crystal against a melt ) , or they may diffuse along the crystal surface @xcite .",
    "this leads to the crystal surface having a normal velocity @xmath22 , which will in general be the sum of a component @xmath23 from molecules arriving by diffusion through the bulk and @xmath24 from those arriving along the surface . in sections",
    "[ bd ] and [ sd ] we consider limiting cases where only one of these mechanisms predominates . for vapor phase sintering",
    ", it is likely that surface diffusion will dominate , while for liquid phase sintering bulk diffusion may be the important mode @xcite .",
    "the case where crystal facets interfere @xcite has been the subject of more recent work , but is not our concern in this paper .",
    "consider now two crystals which are close to their equilibrium shapes ( and therefore close to being spherical at least in the region of interest ) .",
    "if these crystals are brought into gentle contact , the curvature near the contact point will be large and negative , and therefore a neck will appear and rapidly grow .",
    "there will usually be a grain boundary coincident with this neck , but in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , where equilibrium is approached from an initial dihedral angle of @xmath25 radians , in the case of two sintering crystals , the initial dihedral angle is @xmath26 , and we no longer expect grain boundary grooving @xcite .",
    "the initial stages of neck growth occur rapidly , but nevertheless can be of importance in the rheology of crystal slurries , where contacts may be formed and broken in rapid succession .",
    "relevant examples might include the flow of lava @xcite or of brash ice @xcite .",
    "the initial growth of necks between two crystals has been analysed previously , for example in ref .",
    "@xcite where a @xmath27 time dependence for neck radius as a function of time @xmath28 after contact was found for the case of bulk diffusion limited growth .",
    "image ( a ) shows schematically two spherical crystals that are in contact and have started to sinter together , forming a narrow neck of radius @xmath29 ( where all distances are scaled by a suitable capillary length ) .",
    "the crystals are axi - symmetric about an axis up the page . in ( b ) , a magnified portion of the neck region is depicted , illustrating that at the very earliest stages of sintering , the surfaces of the two crystals are nearly parallel close to the neck . image ( c ) shows a 2 dimensional slot - shaped cavity , with exactly parallel surfaces , which we use as an approximation to the axi - symmetric geometry in ( b ) .",
    "image ( d ) shows a 2d slot - shaped cavity of finite length , which is more appropriate for simulations.,width=288 ]    for the development of this paper , we note that there is a geometrical simplification which occurs in the earliest stages of neck growth and which appears to have been overlooked in the literature : if we consider two crystals just after they have touched ( fig .",
    "[ slot ] ) the parts of the surface near the contact point ( except for the very high curvature neck ) are very nearly parallel to one another .",
    "this suggests that an interesting geometry for investigating the early stages of neck growth is a @xmath30 dimensional slot - shaped cavity , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ slot](c ) .",
    "the closer in time we are to first contact the better this is as an approximation .",
    "furthermore , if the radius of the neck is large compared to the separation of these two nearly parallel surfaces ( as is indeed the case at early times ) , then the difference between axi - symmetric cylindrical coordinates and plane cartesian coordinates becomes negligible .    in sections [ bd ] and [ sd ]",
    "we analyse a slot - shaped cavity of this kind , and then compensate for the remaining differences between cylindrical and plane cartesian geometry during structure evolution by invoking conservation of volume . in this way , we obtain the geometry of the crystals in the earliest moments after contact , and also predictions for novel scaling behaviour of the neck size as a function of time after contact .",
    "consider the case where growth is limited by bulk diffusion to and from the crystal surfaces ( attachment kinetics being unimportant because the crystals are roughened ) .",
    "we assume that the mean free path for bulk diffusion is small compared to the feature sizes of interest .",
    "if @xmath31 is the volume fraction in the vapor or melt of the type of molecules that can make up the crystal , then this quantity obeys a diffusion equation with a diffusivity @xmath32 .",
    "we make the further approximation that the transients of this equation have died out , so that the concentration field @xmath33 obeys laplace s equation @xmath34 this requires that the surface normal velocity @xmath22 should be small compared to @xmath32 divided by a typical feature size .",
    "the normal velocity @xmath22 of the crystal surface ( which we denote by the set of points @xmath35 ) is obtained by conservation of volume for the crystallizing material : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is an outward unit normal vector to @xmath35 .",

    "( [ vn_bd ] ) and ( [ laplace ] ) with the result that the volume of an enclosed cavity is conserved under this evolution , while for a discrete crystal in an open volume of vapour or melt , one must also consider the concentration at infinity before it is possible to say anything about conservation of crystal volume .",
