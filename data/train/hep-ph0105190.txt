    "a description of leptonic constants for a heavy quarkonium composed of heavy quark and heavy anti - quark @xmath0 plays an important role in studies of qcd dynamics in the sector of heavy quarks .",
    "so , the precision calculations of heavy quark masses @xmath3 and running coupling constant @xmath4 in qcd are performed in the framework of qcd sum rules @xcite and effective theory of nonrelativistic heavy quarks , nrqcd @xcite .",
    "in such the approach the experimental data on both the masses of @xmath5-wave quarkonium states and their leptonic constants @xcite are used .",
    "the consideration of nrqcd sum rules was done for the bottomonium with taking into account of one - loop gluon corrections in @xcite ( next - to - leading - order , nlo ) as well as with two - loop corrections in @xcite ( next - to - next - to - leading - order , n@xmath6lo ) , and for the charmonium in @xcite . in general , the sum rules of nrqcd could be used for the solution of inverse problem , i.e. the calculation of leptonic constants at given values of heavy quark masses , a definite normalization of coupling constant and the experimental mass spectrum of quarkonia . the only additional entry is caused by that the analysis in the framework of nrqcd sum rules supposes that the region under study remains correctly defined only if one takes into account the higher excitations of ground state , so that one should fix the ratios of leptonic constants , i.e. their relative weights in the sum rules , along with the mass spectrum .",
    "another way is to go in the region of parameters , where the contributions of ground state excitations are negligible , and the term of gluon condensate becomes significant , while its wilson coefficient requires cumbersome calculations in higher orders of perturbation theory .",
    "an alternative method is the description of heavy quarkonium in the framework of potential approach . in this way , if the static potential in qcd with infinitely heavy sources in the fundamental representation of color gauge group is given , then in the leading order of nrqcd , i.e. , if we neglect relativistic corrections and interactions depending on the quark spins , the heavy quark masses can be determined with a high accuracy from the comparison of experimental mass spectrum of heavy quarkonia @xmath7 and @xmath2 with the estimates in the nrqcd . in this procedure ,",
    "one calculates the spectra of stationary energy levels @xmath8 for the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation with the static potential , so that the masses are defined by the expression @xmath9 , where @xmath10 are the masses of heavy quark and heavy anti - quark composing the quarkonium . in addition , in ref .",
    "@xcite authors derived the static potential in qcd , so that it takes into account recent perturbative results at short distances @xcite as well as the regime of confinement in the infrared region .",
    "this potential is straightforward modification of model by buchmller and tye @xcite , who suggested the method with unified two - loop @xmath11-function for the effective charge @xmath12 .",
    "this function satisfied two definite asymptotic limits at @xmath13 ( the perturbation theory ) and @xmath14 ( the potential confining the quarks in hadrons , in the form of linearly raising term under the distance increase ) .",
    "the calculations in three loops @xcite shown that the value and sign of coefficient @xmath15 modelled in the paper by buchmller and tye are significantly different from the correct results for the @xmath11-function .",
    "the modification allows us to reach a consistent description for combined data on the mass spectra of heavy quarkonia and the evolution parameter @xmath16 for the running coupling constant measured at high virtuality of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "thus , in the potential approach we have got a possibility to estimate the leptonic constants of heavy quarkonia in nrqcd with the quark masses and coupling constant @xmath4 adjusted with a high accuracy .    in this way",
    ", we consider a general scheme for the calculation of leptonic constants , since the results of nrqcd have to be related with the quantities defined in full qcd .",
    "there are two challenges in this respect .",
    "the first one is the wilson coefficient depending on the scale of calculations in nrqcd , which relates the current of nonrelativistic quarks considered in the leading order of inverse heavy quark mass , with the electromagnetic current of heavy quarks in full qcd .",
    "an anomalous dimension of this coefficient @xmath18 is known with the two - loop accuracy @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath18 is matched with the value , which is given by the equality of currents in qcd and its nonrelativistic approximation at a scale @xmath19 about the mass of heavy quark .",
    "therefore , the operator equality of currents in full qcd and nrqcd is completely defined up to the two - loop accuracy .",
    "the second challenge is the matrix element for the current of nonrelativistic quarks over the vacuum and physical state of quarkonium . because of renormalization group invariance of physical quantities ,",
    "this matrix element has got the anomalous dimension equal to that of the current in nrqcd .",
    "for the first time , in the potential approach we perform the consideration involving the factor @xmath20 providing the renormalization invariance of results . in this way",
    ", we have to introduce a scale of normalization for @xmath20 , so that the reasonable region of scale change is restricted by the physical characteristics for the quark system under study .",
    "then , the obtained estimates of leptonic constants for the quarkonia are stable in a region of change for both the qcd - to - nrqcd matching scale @xmath21 and the point of perturbative calculations in nrqcd @xmath22 .",
    "in section 2 we consider the description of leptonic constants for the heavy quarkonia in the framework of nrqcd .",
    "the potential approach is actually given in section 3 .",
    "the numerical estimates are presented in section 4 . in conclusion",
    "we summarize the obtained results .",
    "in the nrqcd approximation for the heavy quarks , the calculation of leptonic constant for the heavy quarkonium with the two - loop accuracy requires the matching of nrqcd currents with the currents in full qcd , @xmath23 where we have introduced the following notations : @xmath24 is the relativistic quark field , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the nonrelativistic spinors of anti - quark and quark , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the four - velocity of heavy quarkonium , so that @xmath29 where the scale @xmath19 gives the normalization point for the matching of nrqcd with full qcd , while @xmath22 denotes the normalization point for the calculations in the perturbation theory of nrqcd .    for the heavy quarkonium composed of heavy quarks with the same flavor ,",
    "the wilson coefficient @xmath18 is known with the two - loop accuracy @xcite @xmath30 and @xmath31 is explicitly given in @xcite .",
    "the anomalous dimension of factor @xmath32 in nrqcd is defined by @xmath33 } \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s^{\\overline{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle}ms}}(\\mu)}{4\\pi}\\right)^k , \\label{anom}\\ ] ] whereas the two - loop calculations representations : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 is a number of `` active '' light quark flavors . ]",
    "give @xmath38 } & = & 0,\\\\ \\gamma_{[2 ] } & = & -16 \\pi^2 c_f \\left(\\frac{1}{3 } c_f + \\frac{1}{2 } c_a\\right ) .",
    "\\label{g2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the initial condition for the evolution of factor @xmath39 is given by the matching of nrqcd current with full qcd at @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the leptonic constant of heavy quarkonium is defined in the following way : @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the vector state polarization @xmath43 . in full qcd the electromagnetic current of quarks",
    "is conserved , while in nrqcd the current @xmath44 has the nonzero anomalous dimension , so that in accordance with ( [ match])([g2 ] ) , we find @xmath45 where , in terms of nonrelativistic quarks , the leptonic constant for the heavy quarkonium is given by the well - known relation with the wave function at the origin @xmath46 and the value of wave function in the leading order is determined by the solution of schrdinger equation with the static potential , so that we isolate the scale dependence of nrqcd current in the factor @xmath47 , while the leptonic constant @xmath48 is evaluated at a fixed normalization point @xmath49 , which will be attributed below .",
    "it is evident that @xmath50 and the anomalous dimension of @xmath51 should compensate the anomalous dimension of factor @xmath32 , so that in two loops we have got @xmath52 } \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s^{\\overline{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle}ms}}(\\mu)}{4\\pi}\\right)^2 .",
    "\\label{anoma}\\ ] ] the physical meaning of @xmath53 is clearly determined by the relations of ( [ a ] ) and ( [ cc ] ) : this factor gives the normalization of matrix element for the current of nonrelativistic quarks expressed in terms of wave function for the two - particle quark state ( in the leading order of inverse heavy quark mass in nrqcd ) .",
    "certainly , in this approach the current of nonrelativistic quarks is factorized from the quark - gluon sea , which is a necessary attribute of hadronic state , so that , in general , this physical state can be only approximately represented as the two - quark bound state . in the consideration of leptonic constants in the framework of nrqcd , this approximation requires to introduce the normalization factor @xmath53 depending on the scale .",
    "the renormalization group equation of ( [ anoma ] ) is simply integrated out , so that @xmath54^{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\gamma_{[2]}}{2\\beta_1}},\\ ] ] where @xmath55 , and @xmath56 . a constant of integration could be defined so that at a scale @xmath57 we would get @xmath58 .",
    "thus , in the framework of nrqcd we have got the parametric dependence of leptonic constant estimates on the scale @xmath57 , which has the following simple interpretation : the normalization of matrix element for the current of nonrelativistic quarks at @xmath57 is completely given by the wave function of two - quark bound state . at other @xmath59 we have to introduce the factor @xmath60 , so that the approximation of hadronic state by the two - quark one becomes inexact .    the relations above are general for the nrqcd description of leptonic constant for the heavy quarkonium in both the approach of sum rules and the calculations with the static potential , so that the only difference is the use of ( [ wave ] ) in the potential approach . in the sum",
    "rules this relation is substituted by the equations for the constants @xmath61 , which follow from the quark - hadron duality in the corresponding scheme of calculations . in this respect , we have to stress that the analysis of nrqcd sum rules for the bottomonium in the two - loop approximation in @xcite took into account the factor of @xmath62 in a different way .",
    "so , in the calculation of two - point correlator for the currents of nonrelativistic quarks the regularization is necessary in the two - loop order .",
    "of course , the anomalous dimension of two - point current correlator compensates the anomalous dimension of corresponding wilson coefficient . in the sum rules with the one - loop gluon correction @xcite this factor",
    "can be omitted , since its one - loop anomalous dimension is equal to zero , and , hence , the factor can be supposed equal to unit .",
    "as we have shown taking into account the two - loop corrections , the calculations without the normalization factor @xmath53 for the matrix element of nrqcd current would be , in general , not correct .",
    "some comments are to the point .",
    "it is worth to note that we deal with the operator product expansion ( ope ) , wherein the electromagnetic current of heavy quarks is expressed in terms of leading @xmath63-order current of nonrelativistic spinors near the threshold .",
    "therefore , in this ope the corresponding wilson coefficient , i.e. the matching factor @xmath18 , appears .",
    "the first problem is a calculation of this factor .",
    "the second is an evaluation of matrix element for the nrqcd current of nonrelativistic quarks .",
    "these two problems should be clearly distinguished in the estimates .",
    "the calculation of wislon coefficient @xmath18 can be done in two ways .",
    "originally , it was done in the technique of threshold expansion of loop integrals for feynman diagrams in full qcd for heavy quarks @xcite .",
    "we use this result throughout this paper .",
    "further , the second way of @xmath18 calculation is the following : one should perturbatively expand the qcd lagrangian for the interacting heavy quark and heavy anti - quark separated by a distance @xmath64 in terms of nonrelativistic spinors and represent the perturbative potential contributions different from the interactions with soft and ultrasoft fields in the hadron .",
    "these soft terms are not essential in the perturbative calculations of matching factor @xmath65 at high virtualities , and under such conditions the system of heavy quark and heavy anti - quark can be considered as the coulomb system in the leading approximation , while the potential corrections such as the spin - dependent and relativistic terms in the form of @xmath63 contributions converted to the @xmath4 corrections to the energy , since in the coulomb systems the distance behaves as @xmath66 .",
    "anyway , the main point is that the factor @xmath18 can be calculated in the _ perturbative theory_. it is important that the fact of cancellation of anomalous dimension for the factor @xmath18 by the anomalous dimension for the nrqcd current follows from the zero anomalous dimension of electromagnetic current in full qcd with no reference to the calculation procedure , of course .",
    "thus , the cancellation has no connection to the problem of evaluation for the hadronic matrix element of nrqcd current .",
    "indeed , the effective expansion of qcd lagrangian for the heavy quarks in the form of potential nonrelativistic qcd ( pnrqcd ) @xcite or velocity - counting nonrelativistic qcd ( vnrqcd , discussed below ) @xcite can not be applied to such the calculation of matrix element because the leading coulomb approximation does not dominate in comparison with corrections for the real quarkonia , even for the @xmath67 .",
    "so , in pnrqcd and vnrqcd the potentials are treated as wilson coefficients in front of four quark operators , while the soft and ultrasoft terms are separated .",
    "this separation is valid only if the time for the formation of coulomb wave function is many times less than the time of interaction with the soft fields ( a quark - gluon sea and a string ) . then",
    ", @xmath68 these times can be easily evaluated in terms of distance between the quarks , their velocity and soft scale @xmath16 , so that @xmath69 .",
    "[ cols= \" > \" , ]     } m_q v^2 _ qcd .",
    "@xmath69 therefore , in order to allow one to correctly use the pnrqcd or vnrqcd to the description of matrix elements , the kinetic energy of heavy quark motion should be many times greater than the scale of confinement .    in practice , estimates for the most deep ` coulomb ' system @xmath70 give @xmath71 thus , in order to get the potential model applicable to the real quarkonia , one should include _ soft terms _ in the _ static _ energy , i.e. the _",
    "static potential_. this static potential has an infrared stability and it is independent of any separation of soft and non - soft terms in the static energy .",
    "the static potential defined in terms of wilson loop possesses these properties and it does not coincide with the potential ( wilson coefficient ) in pnrqcd or vnrqcd , since the infrared contributions are added , but separated .",
    "therefore , we deal with the model , wherein the total energy of all dynamical fields in the presence of static sources is taken into account . by the way",
    ", the relativistic and spin - dependent corrections in this case determine the scale of corrections about 50 mev and their contribution gives the uncertainty of estimation , which is many times less than the uncertainty due to the scale variation in the estimates for the leptonic constants with the static potential .",
    "we stress that there is an ordinary situation in the leptonic constant calculation , since the perturbative technique used to evaluate the wislon coefficient can not be explored in order to get a correct estimate for the hadronic matrix element for the operator in front of the wislon coefficient .",
    "recently , the effective theory for the heavy nonrelativistic quark and antiquark pair in qcd was developed on the basis of relative velocity expansion @xcite .",
    "this approach uses the so - called velocity renormalization group , so that we refer to such the theory as vnrqcd .",
    "the physical argumentation of vnrqcd is the following : in the heavy quark - antiquark system one expects a low influence of light quark - gluon sea formed by nonperturbative emission of quarks and gluons with virtualities about @xmath16 , so that the heavy quark motion is close to the coulomb approximation up to higher order corrections in @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , we can suppose the coulomb relations between various scales , which possess the following counting rules : the relative velocity @xmath72 , the momentum transfer ( or the inverse distance between the quarks ) , i.e. the soft scale @xmath73 , the momentum of heavy quark @xmath74 , while the kinetic and potential energies , i.e. the ultrasoft scale , @xmath75 , so that in the perturbative part of effective lagrangian the distance , momentum and energy are not free independent quantities , since they are related by the single `` running '' parameter @xmath28 .",
    "this approach is certainly different from pnrqcd , wherein the static bilinear operators of nonrelativistic spinors are fixed at a short distance , while the kinetic energy as well as the quark momenta are put to zero .",
    "thus , the starting point of vnrqcd is the correlation of soft and ultrasoft scales , @xmath76 , in contrast to pnrqcd .",
    "therefore , in vnrqcd the matching with the full qcd at the scale of heavy quark mass @xmath77 and the renormalization group evolution with @xmath28 involving large @xmath78 result in a combined summation^n \\sim",
    "[ \\ln \\alpha_s]^n$ ] reproduce so - called manifestly nonanalytic contributions in @xmath4-expansion . ] of relevant momentum and energy contributions from @xmath79 up to @xmath80 , while pnrqcd deals with the two - step matching and evolution : nrqcd matched with full qcd at @xmath81 and evolved to @xmath82 , and pnrqcd matched with nrqcd at @xmath83 and evolved to @xmath84 .",
    "a peculiar feature of vnrqcd summing up both logs of @xmath83 and @xmath85 is that the limits of @xmath86 or @xmath87 do not reproduce the static limit ( see explanations provided by examples in @xcite ) .",
    "next point is the anomalous dimension of nonrelativistic current , that was calculated in @xcite in the technique of vnrqcd .",
    "one found that expressions ( [ anom])-([g2 ] ) are reproduced in vnrqcd and strictly valid at @xmath88 , while at lower virtualities with @xmath89 some corrections in @xmath78 appear .",
    "these corrections can be summed up in vnrqcd , so that substitution of @xmath90 for @xmath91 in the two - loop anomalous dimension could be quite naive and not strictly justified , by opinion in @xcite .",
    "the analogous two - loop anomalous dimension @xmath92 of @xmath93 in vnrqcd as well as the complete expression for @xmath94 integrated out in the velocity renormalization group are available in @xcite .",
    "so , @xmath95,\\ ] ] where @xmath96 are expressed in terms of @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , and the functions @xmath100 have the form @xmath101 k_4 = 1- z^{1 - 13c_a/(6\\beta_0)},\\;\\ ; & \\multicolumn{2}{l}{k_5 = 1- z^{1 - 2c_a/\\beta_0 } , }",

    "indeed , the substitution @xmath105 influences the three - loop anomalous dimension @xmath92 for @xmath93 , only .",
    "the argumentation of vnrqcd is that the corrections summing up @xmath106^n$ ] are dominant ( in all orders in @xmath4 ) .",
    "so , the above note on the scale substitution manifests itself in three - loop running of coulomb - like potentials in vnrqcd .    in the present paper",
    "we follow the static ideology with the threshold expression for @xmath107 ( and hence , @xmath53 ) , since we adopt the schrdinger equation with the model of static potential for the @xmath0 system in contrast to the coulomb approximation improved by the velocity renormalization group involving running coulomb and relevant potentials .",
    "moreover , the threshold expression for @xmath107 is preferable by technical reasons , since , first , it is valid at the two - loop order ( as we have mentioned above ) , second , @xmath107 has an explicit dependence on the matching scale @xmath19 , that allows us to study the point stable under the variation of @xmath19 ( see below ) , while in vnrqcd the matching scale is fixed and prescribed to @xmath77 , and the corresponding analysis on the stability is not possible .",
    "third , the factor @xmath107 contains the two - loop final term independent of @xmath108 , while @xmath94 does not ( except the one - loop term ) , since in the large @xmath78 approximation the two - loop final term is irrelevant .",
    "this two - loop final term in @xmath107 makes the cancellation of @xmath109-dependence in the product of @xmath110 valid in a restricted region of @xmath109 , that is conceptually true , while in vnrqcd the large log approximation results in the complete cancellation of @xmath28-dependence ( remember , @xmath111 ) in the product of @xmath112 . nevertheless ,",
    "since we assume the existence of @xmath57 , at which @xmath58 , then we can estimate the above product by @xmath113 .",
    "the problem on the choice of @xmath57 in vnrqcd is more artificial than in nrqcd , since the analysis of stability on @xmath19 results in a preferable prescription for @xmath57 in nrqcd , while in vnrqcd we have no analogous criterion ( see section 4 with numerical results ) .",
    "the potential of static heavy quarks illuminates the most important features of qcd dynamics : the asymptotic freedom and confinement . in the leading order of perturbative qcd at short distances and with a linear confining term in the infrared region ,",
    "the potential of static heavy quarks was considered in the cornell model @xcite , incorporating the simple superposition of both asymptotic limits ( the effective coulomb and string - like interactions ) .",
    "the observed heavy quarkonia posed in the intermediate distances , where both terms are important for the determination of mass spectra ( see fig .",
    "[ gre ] ) .",
    "so , the phenomenological approximations of potential ( logarithmic one @xcite and power law @xcite ) , taking into account the regularities of such the spectra , were quite successful @xcite .",
    "( 70,110 ) ( 30,0 ) ( 130,3)@xmath64 , fm ( 45,107)@xmath114 , gev    the quantities more sensitive to the global properties of potential are the wave functions at the origin as related to the leptonic constants and production rates .",
    "so , the potentials consistent with the asymptotic freedom to one and two loops as well as the linear confinement were proposed by richardson @xcite , buchmller and tye @xcite , respectively .",
    "in qcd the static potential is defined in a manifestly gauge invariant way by means of the vacuum expectation value of a wilson loop @xcite , @xmath115 here , @xmath116 is taken as a rectangular loop with time extension @xmath117 and spatial extension @xmath64 .",
    "the gauge fields @xmath118 are path - ordered along the loop , while the color trace is normalized according to @xmath119 .",
    "this definition corresponds to the calculation of effective action for the case of two external sources fixed at a distance @xmath64 during an infinitely long time period @xmath117 , so that the time - ordering coincides with the path - ordering .",
    "moreover , the contribution into the effective action by the path parts , where the charges have been separated to the finite distance during a finite time , can be neglected in comparison with the infinitely growing term of @xmath120 .",
    "let us emphasize that the defined static potential is , by construction , the renormalization invariant quantity , since the action , by definition , doe not depend on the normalization point .",
    "generally , one introduces the v scheme of qcd coupling constant by the definition of qcd potential of static quarks in momentum space as follows : @xmath121 so that for the such - way introduced value of @xmath122 one can derive some results at large virtualities in the perturbative qcd as well as at low transfer momenta in the approximation of linear term in the potential confining the quarks .    in this section ,",
    "first , we discuss two regimes for the qcd forces between the static heavy quarks : the asymptotic freedom and confinement .",
    "then we follow the method by buchmller and tye and formulate how these regimes can be combined in a unified @xmath11 function for @xmath122 obeyed both limits of small and large qcd couplings .    in the perturbative qcd up to the two - loop accuracy , the quantity @xmath122 can be matched with @xmath123 by the relation @xmath124 at present , in ( [ vms ] ) the coefficients of tree approximation @xmath125 , one - loop contribution @xmath126 and new two - loop results @xmath127 ( see @xcite ) are known .",
    "note that expansion ( [ vms ] ) can not be straightforwardly extended to higher orders of perturbative qcd because of infrared problems , that result in nonanalytic terms in the three - loop perturbative potential as was first discussed by appelquist , dine and muzinich @xcite .    after the introduction of @xmath128 , the @xmath11 function is actually defined by @xmath129 so that @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "the fourier transform results in the position - space potential @xcite , so that the perturbative potential , by construction , is independent of normalization point , i.e. it is the renormalization group invariant .",
    "however , in the problem under consideration the truncation of perturbative expansion , wherein the coefficients do not decrease , leads to a strong custodial dependence on the normalization point .",
    "so , putting the normalization point @xmath109 in the region of charmed quark mass , we find that the two - loop potential with the three - loop running coupling constant @xmath132 has an unremovable additive shift depending on @xmath109 .",
    "this shift has variation in wide limits .",
    "this fact illuminates the presence of infrared singularity in the coupling constant of qcd , so that the @xmath109-dependent shift in the potential energy has the form of a pole posed at @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to avoid the ambiguity of static potential in qcd we have to deal with infrared stable quantities .",
    "the motivation by buchmller and tye was to write down the @xmath11 function of @xmath122 consistent with two known asymptotic regimes at short and long distances .",
    "they proposed the function , which results in the effective charge determined by two parameters , only : the perturbative parameter is the scale in the running of coupling constant at large virtualities and the nonperturbative parameter is the string tension .",
    "the necessary inputs are the coefficients of @xmath11 function .",
    "the parameters of potential by buchmller and tye were fixed by fitting the mass spectra of charmonium and bottomonium @xcite . particularly , in such the phenomenological approach the scale @xmath133 mev was determined .",
    "it determines the asymptotic behaviour of coupling constant at large virtualities in qcd .",
    "this value is in a deep contradiction with the current data on the qcd coupling constant @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "in addition , one can easily find that the three - loop coefficient @xmath134 for the @xmath11 function suggested by buchmller and tye is not correct even by its sign and absolute value in comparison with the exact coefficient recently calculated in @xcite .",
    "thus , the modification of buchmller  tye ( bt ) potential of static quarks as dictated by the current status of perturbative calculations is of great interest .",
    "the nonperturbative behaviour of qcd forces between the static heavy quarks at long distances @xmath64 is usually represented by the linear potential ( see discussion in ref.@xcite ) @xmath135 which corresponds to the square - law limit for the wilson loop .",
    "the form of ( [ conf ] ) corresponds to the limit , when at low virtualities @xmath136 the coupling @xmath122 tends to @xmath137 so that @xmath138 which gives the confinement asymptotics for the @xmath139 function .",
    "buchmller and tye proposed the procedure for the reconstruction of @xmath11 function in the whole region of charge variation by the known limits of asymptotic freedom to a given order in @xmath4 and confinement regime . generalizing their method ,",
    "the @xmath140 function found in the framework of asymptotic perturbative theory ( pt ) to three loops , is transformed to the @xmath11 function of effective charge as follows : @xmath141\\right)}+ \\frac{\\beta_1+\\left(\\beta_2^{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle}v } - \\frac{\\beta_1 ^ 2}{\\beta_0}\\right ) { \\mathfrak a}}{\\beta_0 ^ 2 { \\mathfrak a } } \\exp\\left[-\\frac{l^2 { \\mathfrak a}^2}{2}\\right ] , \\label{kko}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the exponential factor in the second term contributes to the next - to - next - to - leading order at @xmath142 .",
    "this function has the essential peculiarity at @xmath142 , so that the expansion is the asymptotic series in @xmath143 . at @xmath14",
    "the @xmath11 function tends to the confinement limit represented in ( [ lim - c ] ) .",
