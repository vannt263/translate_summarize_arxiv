    "the multiplicity fluctuations with event - by - event analysis are expected to provided us some crucial information about the critical end point of quantum chromodynamics phase diagram in the @xmath0 plane  @xcite .",
    "some observables , e.g. the cumulants of ( net - conserved ) charge distributions , have been measured by the beam energy scan ( bes ) program from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) with a wide range of collision energies from @xmath1 gev to @xmath2 gev @xcite .    besides the fluctuation data and theoretical studies on critical fluctuations ,",
    "it is clear that a sufficient understanding of non - critical statistical fluctuations is also important . to bridge the gaps between experimental measurements and statistical fluctuation calculations ,",
    "i have derived a general formalism in statistical model  @xcite for recent multiplicity fluctuation measurements at rhic  @xcite . with the volume corrections ,",
    "the multiplicity distributions can be written as  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the distribution of reference multiplicity @xmath5 here @xmath6 represents the multiplicity of fluctuation measures in moment analysis sub - event @xmath7 , and @xmath8 represents the multiplicity of reference particles in centrality definition sub - event @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 stand for multiplicity distributions in a fixed volume @xmath12 . here",
    "i have assumed that the two sub - events are independent of each other in each event .",
    "first i assume that the probability distribution @xmath10 of reference particles in a fixed volume is poisson distribution",
    ". then the volume v can be substituted by @xmath13 , the poisson parameters of @xmath14 . at non - central collisions ,",
    "the first four cumulants of @xmath15 read  @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the first four reduced cumulants of @xmath19  @xcite @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22    if the net - charge distributions are skellam distributions in a fixed volume , one obtains @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the mean value of positive and negative charges .",
    "the cumulant products of net - charge distributions can be written as  @xcite @xmath27 with @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 . in experiment",
    "@xcite , the kinematic cut for the reference particles ( total charges ) in sub - event @xmath9 is @xmath31 and for the fluctuation measures ( net - charges ) in sub - event @xmath7 is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is pseudorapidity .",
    "therefore , due to the multiplicity distributions as function of @xmath33 are almost platform - like distributions at mid - rapidity , one obtains @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "( [ eq : cumulantp ] ) can be written as @xmath36 where i have used @xmath37 .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cumulantp2 ] ) , the scale variance @xmath38 is close to the skellam expectation , which indicate that the volume corrections on scale variances of net - charge distributions can be neglected .",
    "however , the values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 of net - charge distributions are about four times of the skellam expectations . the corrected cumulant products and data are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ssigmabes ] .",
    "the corrected @xmath39 are closer to the experiment data / nbd baselines than the skellam baselines given in  @xcite .",
    "the corrected @xmath40 are close to the nbd baselines , but fail to quantitatively reproduce the data .",
    "this indicate the existence of correlations between positive and negative charges  @xcite and/or the correlations between the fluctuation measures and the reference particles .",
    "the results indicate that the volume corrections play crucial role for the data of net - charge distributions reported by the star collaboration  @xcite .",
    "( left ) and @xmath41(right ) of the net - charge multiplicity distribution in au+au collisions at @xmath1 to @xmath42 gev .",
    "the data , skellam and nbd baselines are taken from  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : ssigmabes],title=\"fig : \" ]   ( left ) and @xmath41(right ) of the net - charge multiplicity distribution in au+au collisions at @xmath1 to @xmath42 gev .",
    "the data , skellam and nbd baselines are taken from  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : ssigmabes],title=\"fig : \" ]    note that , though it have been shown in the figures , the results in @xmath43 centrality bins are questionable .",
    "this is due to the non - trivial features of volume distributions at most - central collisions , which are reflected in the rapid decreasing of reference multiplicity distributions at top few centrality percentage . with glauber volume distributions",
    ", i found that the non - critical volume corrections on high order cumulants become weak at most - central collisions  @xcite .",
    "however , the details of volume distribution in relativistic heavy ion collisions are required for more precise event - by - event multiplicity studies .",
    "the volume corrections on net - charge distributions at non - central heavy ion collisions have been investigated .",
    "the multiplicity fluctuations of reference particles and fluctuation measures in a fixed volume are simulated by poisson and skellam distributions .",
    "the volume corrections make significant contribution to the measured cumulants products @xmath39 and @xmath40 of net - charge distributions reported by the star collaboration , but can be neglected for the scale variance @xmath38 .",
    "note that , even in a fixed volume , there are many other effects that make the multiplicity distributions deviate from poisson distributions .",
    "these corrections , e.g. , finite volume effect , quantum effect , resonance decays , experimental acceptance , etc  @xcite , should be taken into account , especially in the case of net - proton distributions reported by the star collaboration .",
