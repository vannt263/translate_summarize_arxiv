    "the elemental abundance ratio of [ @xmath0c/@xmath1c ] in the local ism is 60 ( e.g. langer & penzias ( 1993 ) ; lucas & liszt ( 1998 ) ) .",
    "the molecular abundance ratio of @xmath0cx/@xmath1cx is often assumed to be the same as this elemental ratio .",
    "it has been reported , however , that the carbon - chain molecules are diluted in @xmath1c and the ratio varies among molecules ; the ratio of hc@xmath8n / h@xmath1cccn is 79 ( takano et al . 1998 ) , ccs/@xmath1ccs is 230 @xmath9 130 ( sakai et al . 2007 ) and cch/@xmath1cch is larger than 250 ( sakai et al .",
    "these ratios should reflect the production pathway of each molecule .",
    "in addition , recent observations in tmc-1 indicated that the abundances of the @xmath1c isotopomers depend on which carbon atom in a molecule is substituted by @xmath1c .",
    "takano et al .",
    "( 1998 ) observed the three @xmath1c isotopomers of hc@xmath8n , and found that hcc@xmath1cn is more abundant than hc@xmath1ccn and h@xmath1cccn , which indicates three carbon atoms are not equivalent in hc@xmath8n .",
    "takano et al .",
    "( 1998 ) suggested that the neutral - neutral reaction of c@xmath10h@xmath10 + cn is the main formation path to hc@xmath8n .",
    "sakai et al . ( 2007 ; 2010 ) reported the abundance ratios of c@xmath1cs/@xmath1ccs = 4.2 @xmath9 2.3 and c@xmath1ch/@xmath1cch = 1.6 @xmath9 0.4 .",
    "again , these results indicate two carbon atoms are not equivalent in ccs and cch .",
    "sakai et al . ( 2007 ; 2010 ) suggested that the neutral - neutral reactions of ch + cs and ch@xmath10 + c would significantly contribute to the ccs and cch formation , respectively .",
    "these results indicate the neutral - neutral reactions might play an important role in production of such carbon - chain molecules . in this way",
    ", observations of @xmath1c species would be useful to investigate chemistry of organic species .",
    "langer et al . ( 1984 ) and langer & graedel ( 1989 ) constructed theoretical models of the @xmath1c chemistry in the gas phase .",
    "they showed that carbon bearing species are divided into three groups : co , hco@xmath11 and the `` carbon isotope pool '' .",
    "co is @xmath1c - rich and `` carbon isotope pool '' is @xmath1c - poor .",
    "hco@xmath11 , on the other hand , can be either @xmath1c - rich or @xmath1c - poor .",
    "recently woods & willacy ( 2009 ) revisited carbon isotope fractionation including the adsorption of gaseous molecules onto grain surfaces and grain surface reactions , but they do not distinguish @xmath1c isotopomers .",
    "in addition , temporal evolutions in molecular clouds are not investigated in detail , because they focused on @xmath1c species in protoplanetary disks .    in this paper , we present a detailed chemical model in cold dense cloud cores to investigate carbon isotope fractionation and isotopomer fractionation of cch and ccs . in section 2 , we describe our fiducial model . in section 3",
    ", we show the evolutions of molecular abundances , isotope ratios and isotopomer ratios in the fiducial model . in section 4",
    ", we compare our results with the observations in tmc-1 .",
    "we also discuss the dependence of our results on the assumptions of rate coefficients and initial condition of carbon .",
    "since some terms are confusing , we define them here ; `` carbon isotope ratio '' is the abundance ratio of the @xmath0cx/@xmath1cx , and `` carbon isotopomer ratio '' is the abundance ratio of the @xmath0c@xmath1cx/@xmath1c@xmath0cx . if a carbon isotope ratio deviates from the elemental [ @xmath0c/@xmath1c ] ratio , we call it `` carbon isotope fractionation '' .",
    "if carbon isotopomer ratio deviates from unity , we call it `` carbon isotopomer fractionation '' .",
    "there are two processes which fractionate carbon isotopes in molecular clouds : selective photodissociation and isotope - exchange reactions .",
    "carbon monoxide is photodissociated mostly by line absorption . because of the high abundance of co , self - shielding is efficient especially for @xmath0co .",
    "therefore the @xmath0co/@xmath1co ratio is enhanced in the very thin surface region ( @xmath12 @xmath13 1 mag ) ( e.g. van dishoeck et al .",
    "1988 ) . in this study",
    "we consider central regions of molecular cloud cores with @xmath12 @xmath14 10 mag , and hence we do not consider this process in the following sections .",
    "there are small zero - point vibrational energy differences among the isotopically distinct species . in a cloud of low temperature ( @xmath15 10 k )",
    "the isotope fractionation occurs through isotope - exchange reactions .",
    "watson et al . ( 1976 ) pointed out that the carbon isotope fractionation in interstellar molecules mainly occurs as a result of the reaction : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , the zero - point vibrational energy difference between the reactants and products , is 35 k. the rate coefficient of this reaction was measured by watson et al .",
    "( 1976 ) at 300 k and by smith & adams ( 1980 ) at 80 - 510 k. langer et al .",
    "( 1984 ) extrapolated these experimental data below 80 k assuming the following relation between the forward reaction rate coefficient @xmath3 and the backward reaction rate coefficient @xmath18 : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is boltzmann coefficient . at 10 k ,",
    "the forward rate coefficient is 1.34 @xmath21 10@xmath22 @xmath6 s@xmath7 and the backward rate coefficient is 4.0 @xmath21 10@xmath5 @xmath6 s@xmath7 .",
    "smith & adams ( 1980 ) also measured the rate coefficient of the following proton transfer reaction at 80 - 510 k : @xmath23 where the vibrational zero - point energy difference is @xmath17 = 9 k. langer et al .",
    "( 1984 ) estimated the reaction rate coefficient at 10 k : @xmath3 = 6.5 @xmath21 10@xmath24 @xmath6 s@xmath7 and @xmath18 = 2.7 @xmath21 10@xmath24 @xmath6 s@xmath7 .",
    "sakai et al . ( 2007 ; 2010 ) discussed the cause of carbon isotopomer fractionation of ccs and cch based on their observational results in tmc-1 .",
    "they pointed out two possibilities : ( i ) the formation pathways of the species and ( ii ) the exchange of the @xmath1c position after formation of molecules by isotopomer - exchange reactions .",
    "specifically they proposed the reactions in table 1 .",
    "if the observed fractionation is due to the formation paths , the following neutral - neutral reaction ( e.g. turner et al . 2000 ) could significantly contribute to the cch formation : @xmath25 two carbon atoms are not equivalent in this neutral - neutral reaction : @xmath26 @xmath27 if the isotope ratios of the carbon atom and ch@xmath10 are different , the isotopomer ratio of cch deviates from unity .",
    "similarly , the observed isotopomer fractionation of ccs could be due to the neutral - neutral reaction : @xmath28 in which two carbon atoms are not equivalent : @xmath29 @xmath30    in addition , the isotopomer fractionation of cch might propagate to ccs through the following reactions ( yamada et al .",
    "2002 ) : @xmath31 and    @xmath32    @xmath33    @xmath34    in the reaction ( 7 ) , the sulfur atom will attack the end carbon atom of cch , which has the unpaired electron , to form the ccs structure ( yamada et al .",
    "2002 ) . in the case of the sulfur ion",
    ", the reaction may occur in a similar way .",
    "so c@xmath1cs is made from @xmath1cch , and @xmath1ccs is made from c@xmath1ch through these processes . if these processes are efficient , the c@xmath1cs/@xmath1ccs ratio should be less than unity , given the c@xmath1ch/@xmath1cch ratio is greater than unity .",
    "this is inconsistent with the observation : both the isotopomer ratios of cch and ccs are greater than unity .",
    "fractionation by isotopomer - exchange reactions is also possible : @xmath35 where @xmath17 , the zero - point vibrational energy difference of @xmath1cch and c@xmath1ch , is 8.1 k ( r. tarroni , private communication ; tarroni & carter 2003 ) . as a candidate of the isotopomer - exchange reaction of ccs , on the other hand , sakai et al .",
    "( 2010 ) considered the following reaction : @xmath36    where @xmath17 , the zero - point vibrational energy difference of @xmath1ccs and c@xmath1cs , is 17.4 k. according to the energy surface calculations , these exchange reactions , ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) , do not have the activation barrier ( y. osamura private communication ) . at low temperature ( @xmath15 10",
    "k ) , the isotopomer ratios of cch and ccs can be greater than unity .",
    "we construct a chemical reaction network with carbon isotopes and isotopomers .",
    "the network is based on the gas - grain model developed by the ohio state university astrochemistry group ( garrod & herbst 2006 ) , and is expanded to include isotopes and isotopomers by the three procedures described below . while garrod & herbst model consists of 655 species and 6309 reactions , our reaction network consists of 1203 gas and grain species , and 21116 gas phase and grain surface reactions .",
    "firstly , we include @xmath1c species into the reaction network statistically . for reactions involving @xmath1c species , we assume that the total rate coefficient is the same as that of the corresponding reaction of the main isotope .",
    "we distinguish isotopomers only in species with less than three carbons to save computational time .",
    "for example , @xmath1c@xmath0c@xmath0ch , @xmath0c@xmath1c@xmath0ch and @xmath0c@xmath0c@xmath1ch are different species , but @xmath1c@xmath0c@xmath0c@xmath0ch , @xmath0c@xmath1c@xmath0c@xmath0ch , @xmath0c@xmath0c@xmath1c@xmath0ch and @xmath0c@xmath0c@xmath0c@xmath1ch are treated as the same species , @xmath0c@xmath37ch .",
    "we checked molecular structures , so that symmetric molecules , such as c@xmath10h@xmath10 , do not have isotopomers .",
    "we do not consider multiple @xmath1c species for simplicity .",
    "the statistical expansion increases the number of the species and reactions by about two and three fold , respectively .",
    "for example , the reaction @xmath38 with rate coefficients of @xmath39 is replaced by the following five reactions with rates @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath40 , @xmath40 , and @xmath40 , respectively : @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45    in this way , statistical expansion is the main cause of increasing the number of species and reactions .",
    "`` statistically '' means no fractionation occurs . in other words ,",
    "all the isotope ratios are equal to the elemental [ @xmath0c/@xmath1c ] ratio and all the isotopomer ratios are unity .",
    "secondly , we include the gas phase reactions in table 1 referring to the discussion in section 2.2 .",
    "the rate coefficients of these reactions are not measured in the laboratory .",
    "so we assume that the rate coefficients are 1 @xmath21 10@xmath24 @xmath6 s@xmath7 for neutral - neutral reactions and 1 @xmath21 10@xmath22 @xmath6 s@xmath7 for ion - neutral reactions .",
    "the dependence of our results on these rate coefficients is discussed in section 4.3 .    finally , we modify the branching ratios of proton transfer reactions and electron recombination reactions which break the c - h bond , such as @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 in the statistically expanded network , the rate coefficients of these reactions are set to @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath50 , respectively , where @xmath49 is the rate coefficient of the recombination of the @xmath0c species . then these reactions tend to make the isotopomer ratio of ccs unity , even if the isotopomer ratio of hccs@xmath11 are fractionated .",
    "but it would be more likely that these reactions do not rearrange the structure of c - c - s .",
    "so we set the rate coefficient to be @xmath49 , @xmath49 , and zero , respectively .    table 2 lists the elemental abundances in our model ; it is known as `` low metal '' values because of their strong depletions of species heavier than oxygen ( e.g. graedel et al . 1982 ) .",
    "initially the species are assumed to be atoms or atomic ions except for hydrogen , which is in molecular form .",
    "we assume the elemental isotope ratio , [ @xmath0c/@xmath1c ] , of 60 .",
    "if it is higher or lower than 60 , the resultant molecular isotope ratios are scaled by [ @xmath0c/@xmath1c]/60 .",
    "we confirmed in the range of values , [ @xmath0c/@xmath1c ] = 30 - 77 , the deviation from this scaling is less than 4 % .",
    "we use the cosmic ray ionization rate of 1.3 @xmath21 10@xmath51 s@xmath7 , which is commonly used for chemical model simulations for dense molecular clouds ( e.g. terzieva & herbst 1998 ) .",
    "we assume that the sticking probability of colliding gaseous species onto grains is unity , and the adsorbed species can diffuse on the grain surfaces by thermal hopping .",
    "we adopt the same adsorption energies and non - thermal desorption rates as garrod & herbst ( 2006 ) . as a physical model , we assume a static cloud core . in our models , the physical parameters are set to @xmath52 = 10 k , @xmath53 = 5 @xmath21 10@xmath54 and @xmath12 = 10 mag , referring to the observation of tmc-1 ( pratap et al .",
    "1997 ) , unless otherwise stated . in section 3 , we describe the results of our fiducial model .",
    "in this paper , we define abundance as the fractional abundance with respect to h nuclei .",
    "figure 1a shows the evolutions of major carbon - bearing species .",
    "initially the carbon exists as carbon ion , which recombines to form carbon atoms in 10@xmath55 yr .",
    "after a few 10@xmath54 yr major form of carbon is mainly in carbon monoxide , which depletes onto the grain surfaces after 5 @xmath21 10@xmath54 yr .",
    "figure 1b shows the evolutions of the isotope ratios of the carbon - bearing species .",
    "our results agree with langer et al .",
    "( 1984 ) ; carbon bearing species are divided into three groups : co , hco@xmath11 and the `` carbon isotope pool '' .",
    "although we include gas - grain interactions , it does not affect the isotope ratios in the gas phase before the depletion of co ( @xmath56 10@xmath57 yr ) .",
    "adsorption rates are inversely proportional to square root of the mass of species , so that the rate of @xmath0c species and @xmath1c species are different .",
    "but this difference is small ( @xmath13 4 % ) and do not affect significantly .",
    "it should be noted , however , that when the co depletion becomes significant , the reaction ( 1 ) becomes less efficient and isotope ratios of `` carbon isotope pool '' species are lowered compared to the model without gas - grain interactions . since the thermal desorption is ineffective at 10 k , grain surface reactions do not affect isotope ratios of gaseous species .",
    "then the isotope fractionation of the gaseous species is mostly determined by the gas phase reactions and the depletion of co. before a few 10@xmath54 yr the abundance ratio of @xmath58 is significantly smaller than 60 because of the reaction ( 1 ) . as the abundance of co increases with time and co becomes the dominant carbon - bearing species , the isotope ratio gets close to the elemental abundance ratio of [ @xmath0c/@xmath1c ] = 60 .",
    "for example , the @xmath58 ratio is 54 at 10@xmath57 yr .",
    "in contrast , the c@xmath11/@xmath1c@xmath11 ratio is larger than 60 because of the reaction ( 1 ) .",
    "many carbon species are produced by reactions starting from c@xmath11 or c , which is produced by recombination of c@xmath11 .",
    "therefore the isotope ratios of these `` carbon isotope pool '' species are similar to the c@xmath11/@xmath1c@xmath11 ratio before 10@xmath59 yr and the c/@xmath1c ratio after 10@xmath59 yr , although actual values vary among species depending on their production pathways .",
    "for example , the cn/@xmath1cn ratio is 83 , while cs/@xmath1cs ratio is 109 at 10@xmath54 yr .",
    "the evolution of the hco@xmath11/h@xmath1co@xmath11 ratio is similar to those of `` carbon isotope pool '' at @xmath56 10@xmath59 yr , but the ratio is lowered by the reaction ( 2 ) after a few 10@xmath59 yr ; the hco@xmath11/h@xmath1co@xmath11 ratio is 45 at 10@xmath57 yr .    to investigate the density dependence of the isotope ratios , we also performed calculations with @xmath53 = 5 @xmath21 10@xmath59 and 5 @xmath21 10@xmath57 @xmath60 .",
    "the evolution is in general faster at higher densities .",
    "since we are interested in carbon - bearing species , we compare isotope ratios of these molecules at the time of peak carbon - chain abundance ; 1 @xmath21 10@xmath57 , 2 @xmath21 10@xmath54 and 4 @xmath21 10@xmath59 yr for densities of @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "we found that the isotope ratios do not significantly depend on density .",
    "for example , the @xmath64 ratio at the selected time is 83 , 81 and 80 , and the @xmath65 ratio is 83 , 92 and 108 for densities of @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 @xmath60 , respectively",

    "carbon monoxide , on the other hand , is directly absorbed on grain surfaces and is also formed by the grain surface reactions of the carbon - bearing species",
    ". then the isotope ratio of co on grain surfaces is slightly different from that in the gas phase .",
    "the isotope ratios of ice mantle species depend mainly on whether the species are formed from the carbon atom or the co molecule ; the isotope ratio is larger than 60 if the species are formed from c atom , while the ratio is smaller than 60 if the species are formed from co. for example , ch@xmath8oh is formed from the carbon atom and its isotope ratio is 81 at @xmath67 = 2 @xmath21 10@xmath57 yr .",

    "2010 ) . the average isotope ratio , which is calculated by @xmath81 is higher than 200 , and is three times higher than our model . additional isotope - exchange reactions , which are currently unknown , may be needed to reproduce the observed values . on the other hand ,",
    "the observed c@xmath1ch/@xmath1cch ratio is 1.6 @xmath9 0.4 ( sakai et al . 2010 ) , which is in reasonable agreement with our model .",
    "therefore the exchange reaction ( 9 ) can account for the isotopomer fractionation of cch .",

    "the observed ccs/@xmath1ccs , ccs / c@xmath1cs and c@xmath1cs/@xmath1ccs ratios are 230 @xmath9 130 , 54 @xmath9 5 , and 4.2 @xmath9 2.3 , respectively ( sakai et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the average isotope ratio is 87 , which is in good agreement with our model results .",
    "but our model underestimates the isotopomer fractionation .",
    "we discuss this problem in the next section .",
    "the isotopomer - exchange reaction ( 10 ) is not efficient enough to account for the observed isotopomer ratio of ccs , because of the low abundance of sulfur atoms .",
    "since the reactant is not necessarily the sulfur atom for the exchange reaction , we consider a possibility of the following neutral - neutral reaction : @xmath82 where @xmath17 is 17.4 k. this can be regarded as a catalytic reaction by the hydrogen atom . according to the quantum chemical calculation by yamada et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , the reaction ( 11 ) does not have the activation barrier .",
    "it could be more effective than the reaction ( 10 ) , because the hydrogen atom is more abundant than the sulfur atom .",
    "since the rate coefficients of the reaction ( 11 ) has not been measured or calculated , we simply assume that the forward rate coefficient is 1 @xmath21 10@xmath24 @xmath6 s@xmath7 , which is a typical collisional rate coefficient between neutral species .",
    "figure 9a shows the temporal evolution of the isotopomer ratio of ccs in the model with the exchange reaction ( 11 ) .",
    "the ratio is significantly enhanced in comparison with the model in figures 7 and 8 , and reaches nearly the equilibrium ratio of 5.7 ( @xmath3/@xmath18 ) at a few 10@xmath54 yr .",
    "after several 10@xmath54 yr , ccs abundance decreases by about two orders of magnitude ( figure 3a ) .",
    "the abundance of s - bearing molecular ions , such as hccs@xmath11 , decrease only by an order of magnitude , because h@xmath75 abundance is enhanced by the co depletion .",
    "then the exchange reaction ( 11 ) , whose efficiency is proportional to the ccs abundance , becomes less effective than ion - molecule reactions , and the isotopomer ratio decreases to 4.1 . our model with the reaction ( 11 ) can reasonably explain the observed isotopomer ratio .",
    "the isotopomer fractionation also affects the isotope ratios , ccs/@xmath1ccs and ccs / c@xmath1cs ( figure 9b ) .",
    "@xmath1c is significantly diluted in @xmath1ccs , and the ccs/@xmath1ccs ratio is higher than 200 in several 10@xmath54 yr .",
    "on the other hand , the ccs / c@xmath1cs ratio is lower than 60 . at 2 @xmath21 10@xmath54 yr ,",
    "the ccs/@xmath1ccs and ccs / c@xmath1cs ratios are 263 and 47 , respectively , which are in reasonable agreement with the observed isotope ratios .",
    "hence the reaction ( 11 ) is a possible culprit for the isotopomer fractionation of ccs .",
    "[ [ dependences - on - rate - coefficients - of - isotopomer - exchange - reactions ] ] dependences on rate coefficients of isotopomer - exchange reactions ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    in the previous sections we assumed the forward reaction rate coefficients of the isotopomer - exchange reactions are all 1 @xmath21 10@xmath24 @xmath6 s@xmath7 , which is a typical collisional rate coefficient between neutral species .",
    "however it is not obvious whether the actual exchange reactions proceed at the collisional rate .",
    "for example , the rate coefficient of the similar type of reactions , such as hnc@xmath8 + h @xmath83 hc@xmath8n + h , is assumed to be 1 @xmath21 10@xmath5 @xmath60 s@xmath7 in our model ( e.g. garrod @xmath84 herbst 2006 ) . in particular , reaction ( 11 ) requires the rearrangement of the order of the carbon nuclei in the chain through the transient cyclic isomers ( yamada et al .",
    "although the reaction is exothermic , the efficiency of reaction ( 11 ) might be low .",
    "hence , we investigate the dependence of the isotopomer ratios on the rate coefficients of reactions ( 9 ) and ( 11 ) .",
    "figure 10 shows the temporal evolution of the isotopomer ratios of ( a ) cch and ( b ) ccs .",
    "the forward reaction rate coefficients are 1 @xmath21 10@xmath24 @xmath6 s@xmath7 ( solid line ) , 1 @xmath21 10@xmath5 @xmath6 s@xmath7 ( dashed line ) and 1 @xmath21 10@xmath85 @xmath6 s@xmath7 ( dotted line ) .",
    "we can see the forward reaction rate coefficients should be larger than 1 @xmath21 10@xmath5 @xmath6 s@xmath7 to account for the observed isotopomer ratios by the exchange reactions ( 9 ) and ( 11 ) .",
    "laboratory measurements , as well as more detailed theoretical calculations of these isotopomer - exchange reactions , are highly desirable .",
    "so far , we have assumed that all the carbon initially exists as carbon ions .",
    "this assumption is the most favorable for the carbon isotope fractionation , because the isotope - exchange reaction ( 1 ) becomes efficient . here",
    ", we investigate the dependencies of isotope ratios on the initial condition of the carbon .",
    "we performed calculations with two different initial conditions ; ( 1 ) a half of the carbon exists as atomic carbon , and ( 2 ) all the carbon is in atomic form . in the former case ,",
    "the evolution of isotope ratios in the gas phase is very similar to the fiducial model , because the abundances of major carbon - bearing species are almost the same as the fiducial model after 10@xmath55 yr .",
    "figure 11 shows the evolutions of ( a ) molecular abundances and ( b ) isotope ratios in the gas phase for the latter case : all the carbon is initially atomic carbon .",
    "the molecular abundances and isotope ratios are different from the fiducial model before 10@xmath57 yr , but they approach to the fiducial model after a few 10@xmath57 yr . the abundances of c , c@xmath11 and co are similar to those in the fiducial model after 10@xmath54 yr . the isotope ratio of co is nearly 60 before 10@xmath54 yr , since the abundance of c@xmath11 is small .",
    "after 10@xmath54 yr the ratio slightly decreases : @xmath0co/@xmath1co = 56 at 10@xmath68 yr . on the other hand ,",
    "the isotope ratio of c@xmath11 is as high ( @xmath4 60 ) as in the fiducial model , since the abundance of co is smaller than in the fiducial model only by an order of magnitude .",
    "the isotope ratio of the carbon atom is nearly 60 before 10@xmath57 yr .",
    "after 10@xmath57 yr the ratio becomes greater than 60 because of the neutralization of the carbon ion .",
    "`` carbon isotope pool '' species are mostly produced from the carbon atoms , then their isotope ratios are similar to that of the carbon atom . in this way , the carbon isotope fractionation occurs by the isotope - exchange reactions after 10@xmath57 yr , even if all the carbon is initially in the carbon atom .",
    "these results suggest isotope fractionation in early times does not much affect the isotope ratios after 10@xmath57 yr . in order to account for the isotope fractionation at the period of peak carbon chain abundances ( @xmath86 yr ) , however , some fraction of carbon should be carbon ion initially .",
    "we constructed a gas - grain chemical network model that includes carbon isotopes and isotopomers in order to investigate the evolution of molecular abundances , the carbon isotope ratios and the isotopomer ratios of cch and ccs in cold dense cloud cores .",
    "the principal results are follows .",
    "we confirm that the isotope ratios of molecules , both in the gas phase and on grain surfaces , mostly depend on whether the species is formed from the carbon atom ( ion ) or the co molecule ; the isotope ratio is larger than the elemental abundance ratio of [ @xmath0c/@xmath1c ] if the species is formed from the carbon atom , while the ratio is smaller if the species is formed from the co molecule .",
    "there are two possible processes of isotopomer fractionation : ( i ) the formation pathways of the species and ( ii ) the exchange of the @xmath1c position by isotopomer - exchange reactions .",
    "we reproduce the observed isotopomer ratio c@xmath1ch/@xmath1cch by considering the isotopomer - exchange reaction : @xmath1cch + h @xmath83 c@xmath1ch + h + 8.1 k , if this reaction proceeds with the forward rate coefficient @xmath3 @xmath4 10@xmath5 @xmath6 s@xmath7 .",
    "the isotope ratio is underestimated in our model , which is left for future studies .",
    "we reproduce the observed c@xmath1cs/@xmath1ccs , ccs / c@xmath1cs and ccs/@xmath1ccs ratios simultaneously by considering the isotopomer - exchange reaction : @xmath1ccs + h @xmath83 c@xmath1cs + h + 17.4 k , if this reaction proceeds with the forward rate coefficient @xmath3 @xmath4 10@xmath5 @xmath6 s@xmath7 .",
    "\\4 . in conclusion",
