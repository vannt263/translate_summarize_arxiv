    "no evidence of such a  low-@xmath8 window has been found experimentally  @xcite .",

    "the green s function technique is attractive in that it allows one to incorporate different types of correlations within @xmath28 in the system dynamics , without resorting to the quasiparticle limit .",
    "the description of the reaction can be made consistent with the description of the structure of the reacting nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the serious disadvantage of the method is that potentially enormous amount of information , representing the 8-dimensional structure of the green s functions , must be monitored for a reaction .",
    "a secondary deficiency is that potentially two separate calculations need to be carried out to complete a reaction simulation : one preparing the system for the reaction and second advancing the reaction in time .",
    "the 8-dimensional information in the green s function can be generally understood as mappable onto the 3 components of particle momentum , onto energy ( an  independent variable outside of the quasiparticle limit ) and onto time and 3 components of position where the particle momentum and energy are considered .",
    "an increase in the dimension by one variable , the energy , as compared to be , might be considered a minor complication .",
    "however , the serious issue is that no positive - definite quantity can be associated with the green s functions , such as @xmath41 , thus precluding the possibility of applying the test - particle method .",
    "the advantage of the test - particle method is that it allows one to concentrate on the parts of the phase space that matter at a  given stage of the reaction . without this method ,",
    "a mesh in space - time needs to be established and different space - time regions may potentially need to be monitored , irrespectively of whether or not those regions dominate a  given stage of a reaction .",
    "an alternative to the mesh is projection onto mean - field wavefunctions @xcite , but that can limit excitation energies in the reaction simulations . in the following , we shall try to assess whether the whole involved space - time region needs indeed to be monitored within the mesh set up for the reaction .",
    "we shall carry out the assessment in one dimension , where the cost of monitoring the whole space - time is moderate , unlike in three dimensions , where the cost of such monitoring is devastating .",
    "we shall also consider the possibility of preparing the initial state when following time evolution such as in a reaction .      to assess the importance of different regions in the domain of the green s functions , we consider interactions of nuclear slabs , for which density changes in the @xmath42-direction and for which transverse degrees of freedom are frozen .",
    "those slabs are spin - isospin symmetric and follow mean - field dynamics with coulomb interactions switched off . under these circumstances , the dynamics is consistently described in terms of the green s function @xmath39 at equal time arguments and at equal transverse positions .",
    "the trace of the density matrix over spin and isospin is then ( x , x , t ) - 4 g^<(x , y , z , t , x,y , z , t ) , where the factor of 4 represents the spin - isospin degeneracy .",
    "the density matrix satisfies the equation of motion    i ( x , x , t ) = & ( x , x , t ) + & - ( x , x , t ) ,    [ eq : rhoeom ] where @xmath3 is a skyrme mean - field of the form u = t_0 n(x , t ) + t_3 ^1 + , and the density @xmath43 represents diagonal elements of the density matrix , @xmath44 .",
    "the parameter constants in the skyrme interaction are fitted to the properties of nuclei .",
    "if the density matrix is diagonalized in terms of eigenstate wavefunctions , as in , then eq .   can be solved by having the wavefunctions follow the tdhf equations .",
    "however , in the context of the green s functions , it is the equation for the density matrix , eq .  , that is of interest .",
    "net kinetic energy associated with the @xmath42-direction , per unit transverse area , is k(t ) = x .",
    "( x , x,t ) |_x=x , and the net potential energy per unit area is v(t ) = x .    in evolving the slab systems",
    ", we use periodic boundary conditions for the calculational region and employ the split - operator method to advance the density matrix in time .",
    "thus , the change in the density operator over the time - interval @xmath45 may be represented as    ( x , & x , t+ t ) + & = ^-i(k+u ) t ( x , x , t ) ^i(k+u ) t , [ eq : rhodt ]    where @xmath46 is the kinetic - energy operator . using the baker - campbell - hausdorff formula , the exponentials of a sum of non - commuting operators in can be rewritten into a product of exponentials of individual operators ^i(k+u ) t = ^iu ^ik t ^iu + o , with the accuracy of the second order in @xmath45 .",
    "the split - operator method relies on the above rearrangement and the fact that the operators @xmath46 and @xmath3 are diagonal either in the momentum or configuration space .",
    "application of an exponential in either space amounts then just to a multiplication by a phase factor . within the method ,",
    "the advancement of the density matrix in time can be then accomplished by transforming the matrix between configuration and momentum spacing , exploiting fast - fourier - transformation , and multiplication by the respective phase factors .",
    "unitarity is built into the method .",
    "parameter in eqs .   and .",
    "]    with regard to the evolution , we first consider the possibility of preparing the initial state for a reaction in an adiabatic fashion @xcite .",
    "we start out with a state obtained by filling out two lowest orbits of the harmonic oscillator potential and we gradually change the potential from that of the harmonic oscillator to the mean - field one , with u_f(x , t ) = f(t ) x^2 + [ 1 -f(t ) ] u(n(x , t ) ) , [ eq : uf ] where we typically use f(t ) = .",
    "[ eq : ft= ] figure [ fig : ad_ener ] shows the evolution of the net energy per nucleon and net size of the density distribution , when gradually changing the potential .",
    "notably , the energy itself is not that good indicator of the arrival at the ground state , because it depends quadratically on the deviation from the ground state .",
    "characteristics of the density , on the other hand , depend linearly on the deviation and are better indicators .",
    "values of @xmath47 lead to a very good approximation of the mean - field ground - state .",
    "we next consider slab collisions .",
    "for the collisions , the slabs are boosted and positioned against each other . in a boost ,",
    "the individual density matrices transform according to ( x , x,t=0 ) ^ip _ x ( x , x,t=0 ) ^-ip_x , where @xmath48 is the initial c.m .",
    "momentum per nucleon .",

    "@xmath49 , the slabs pass through each other , but get excited and may break up . at still higher energies , @xmath50 , the identity of the original slabs is largely lost , see fig .",
    "[ fig : den25 ] , and the system breaks into a multitude of fragments . in the nuclear reaction terminology , this is called multifragmentation .         in the collision of slabs at @xmath51 .",
    "the snapshots are taken at the same times as in fig .",
    "[ fig : den25 ] ]    figure [ fig : gxx ] shows next the intensity plot for the real part of the density matrix for the system of slabs colliding at the c.m .",
    "energy of 25  mev / nucleon .",
    "the density matrix is always largest along the @xmath52 diagonal and the real components tend to marginally dominate over the imaginary components .",
    "the values of the matrix along the diagonal represent the local density , i.e.  fig .",
    "[ fig : den25 ] . early on in the reaction ,",
    "the more significant values of the density matrix are limited to square - like regions .",
    "the diagonals of these squares are collinear with the diagonal of the density matrix and their size represents the support of the nucleon wavefunctions within the individual slabs . when the system fuses , the size of this region expands to one representing the size of the fused system .",
    "the system evolves further and breaks up into pieces , and the region of significant values for the density matrix expands . besides regions adjacent to the diagonal , islands and streaks of significant values emerge , moving away from the diagonal with time .",
    "these are associated with the fragmentation of the original single - nucleon wavefunctions , into pieces taking off with different fragments .",
    "the regions of significant off - diagonal values for @xmath53 represent phase correlations between the amplitudes for the nucleons , from the individual original states , to move away with one or another fragment .     in testing .",
    "white regions represent elements that get suppressed . ]",
    "the need to monitor far off - diagonal values of the green s functions would have been devastating for the capability of carrying reaction simulations in 3 dimensions .",
    "however , if the fragments from the break - up are not likely to ever meet again , the phase information in the far off - diagonal values should not matter . to test the importance of these far off - diagonal elements , we repeat the calculations employing now a strong imaginary superoperator potential that suppresses elements away from the diagonal axis and leaves the vicinity of the axis in the density matrix intact , see fig .",
    "[ fig : planeg ] .",
    "note that the periodic boundary conditions for the system imply a tile - like periodicity of the density matrix @xmath54 in the @xmath42-@xmath55 plane , with the values on the diagonal repeated next on the lines passing through the corners at @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "when the periodicity is imposed onto the superoperator , the suppression of the matrix elements has to occur in valleys in the @xmath42-@xmath55 plane that are separated by ridges , where the elements remain intact .",

    "figure  [ fig : suppress ] compares the results for the density at three characteristic times in the slab collision at @xmath60 .",
    "each line corresponds to evolutions with different retained regions off the diagonal . only when the matrix elements are suppressed from @xmath61 on ,",
    "some changes in the density , compared to the standard evolution , begin to emerge at late times .",
    "even these changes are subtle and the system may still reach about the same final state , just slightly later .",
    "less severe trimmings of the elements leave no visible signs in the evolution of density for times relevant for reaction dynamics .",
    "figure [ fig : energy_suppress ] shows in addition the evolution of the system size and of the net energy components for different off - diagonal suppressions . only for elements eliminated at @xmath62 ,",
    "a minute change in the energy breakdown begins to emerge at late times .",
    "reasoning that relative phases of amplitudes associated with different fragments would matter only if the fragments could meet again , we have further carried out calculations where we allowed the fragments to reach the boundary of the calculational region , cross to an adjacent region and collide there again . even in those cases",
    ", we found no perceptible difference in the evolution of the density when elements had been eliminated at distances @xmath63 .",
    "the only situation when we find some genuine impact of the far off - diagonal elements is when trying to run the evolution backwards in time .",
    "the original mean - field evolution is time reversible and such , to a very good extent , is its numerical realization .",
    "however , reversibility gets lost when erasing off - diagonal elements and considering longer time intervals .",
    "thus , e.g.  if we suppress elements at @xmath63 , while evolving the system forward in time , past the reaction , and then evolve the system backwards with element suppression , we find that the system has a difficulty reaching its initial state  @xcite .",
    "in general , the system evolved backwards in time , with elements suppressed , acquires , in the past , some features of the state in the future .",
    "thus , in the energy region for fusion , the system is likely to stay fused when evolved back to the early times . in the energy range for multifragmentation , the system may evolve back to two residues but , between them , an additional fragment may remain and the two residues may stay excited .",
    "to sum up , we have obtained encouraging results in our study of slab collisions in one dimension .",
    "only a  limited range of arguments in the density matrix is of practical importance for the evolution forward in time .",
    "the scale for that range turns out in practice to be set by the inverse of fermi momentum .",
    "further , we find that an adiabatic transformation of the hamiltonian allows for an arrival at the ground state of an interacting , albeit mean - field , hamiltonian . those results bode well for the possibility of simulating central nuclear reactions , in 3 dimensions , following the method of nonequilibrium green s functions .",
