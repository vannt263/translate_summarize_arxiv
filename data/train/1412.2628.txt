    "<S> we semiclassically investigate schwinger pair production for pulsed rotating electric fields depending on time . to do so we solve the dirac equation for two - component fields in a wkb - like approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the result shows that for two - component fields the spin distribution of produced pairs is generally not @xmath0 . as a result </S>",
    "<S> the pair creation rates of spinor and scalar quantum electro dynamics ( qed ) are different even for one pair of turning points . for rotating electric fields the pair creation rate is dominated by particles with a specific spin depending on the sense of rotation for a certain range of pulse lengths and frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> we present an analytical solution for the momentum spectrum of the constant rotating field . </S>",
    "<S> we find interference effects not only in the momentum spectrum but also in the total particle number of rotating electric fields . </S>"
