    "the occurance of organized traffic @xcite is not only restricted to human societies .",
    "prominent examples of self - organized motion in biology are herding , flocking and swarm formation @xcite .",
    "in addition , especially ants build trail systems that have many similarities with highway networks @xcite .",
    "ants communicate with each other by dropping a chemical ( generically called _ pheromone _ ) on the substrate as they move forward @xcite .",
    "although we can not smell it , the trail pheromone sticks to the substrate long enough for the other following sniffing ants to pick up its smell and follow the trail .",
    "this process is called _ chemotaxis _ @xcite .",
    "ant trails may serve different purposes ( trunk trails , migratory routes ) and may also be used in a different way by different species .",
    "therefore one - way trails are observed as well as trails with counterflow of ants .    in the following",
    "we will not discuss the process of trail formation itself .",
    "this has been studied in the past ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "instead we assume the existence of a trail network that is constantly reinforced by the ants .",
    "focussing on one particular trail it is natural to assume that the motion of the ants is one - dimensional .    in traffic flow interactions between the vehicles",
    "typically lead to a reduction of the average velocity @xmath0 .",
    "this is obvious for braking maneouvers to avoid crashes",
    ". therefore @xmath1 decreases with increasing density @xmath2 . in the following",
    "we will show that this can be different for ant - trails .",
    "even though due to the similar velocity of the ants overtaking is very rare , which implies that a description in terms of an exclusion process is possible , the presence of the pheromone effectively leads to an enhancement of the velocity .",
    "we just briefly mention that similar ideas can be applied to the description of pedestrian dynamics . in @xcite",
    "we have developed a pedestrian model based on virtual chemotaxis .",
    "the basic principles are very similar to the ant - trail model introduced below",
    ". however , the motion in pedestrian dynamics is essentially two - dimensional .",
    "in @xcite we have developed a particle - hopping model , formulated in terms of a stochastic cellular automaton ( ca ) , which may be interpreted as a model of uni - directional flow in an ant - trail . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec_intro ] we do not want to address the question of the emergence of the ant - trail @xcite , but focus on the traffic of ants on a trail which has already been formed . the model generalizes the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) @xcite with parallel dynamics by taking into account the effect of the pheromone .    the asep is one of the simplest examples of a system driven far from equilibrium .",
    "space is discretized into cells that can be occupied by at most one particle . in the totally asymmetric case ( tasep )",
    "particles are allowed to move in one direction only , e.g.  to the right .",
    "if the right neighbour site is empty a particle hops there with probability @xmath3 . for parallel ( synchronous )",
    "dynamics this is identical to the limit @xmath4 of the nagel - schreckenberg ( nasch ) model @xcite with braking probability @xmath5 .",
    "in our model of uni - directional ant - traffic the ants move according to a rule which is essentially an extension of the tasep dynamics .",
    "in addition a second field is introduced which models the presence or absence of pheromones ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - unidir_model ] ) .",
    "the hopping probability of the ants is now modified by the presence of pheromones .",
    "it is larger if a pheromone is present at the destination site .",
    "furthermore the dynamics of the pheromones has to be specified .",
    "they are created by ants and free pheromones evaporate with probability @xmath6 .",
    "assuming periodic boundary conditions , the state of the system is updated at each time step in two stages ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - unidir_model ] ) . in stage",
    "i ants are allowed to move while in stage ii the pheromones are allowed to evaporate . in each stage",
    "the _ stochastic _ dynamical rules are applied in parallel to all ants and pheromones , respectively .",

    "middle : configuration _ after _ one possible realisation of _ stage i_. two ants have moved compared to the top part of the figure .",
    "the open circle with dashed boundary indicates the location where pheromone will be dropped by the corresponding ant at _ stage ii _ of the update scheme .",
    "also indicated are the existing pheromones that may evaporate in _ stage ii _ of the updating , together with the average rate of evaporation . bottom : configuration _ after _ one possible realization of _ stage ii_. two drops of pheromones have evaporated and pheromones have been dropped / reinforced at the current locations of the ants . , scaledwidth=65.0% ]",
    "_ stage i : motion of ants _ + an ant in a cell can not move if the cell immediately in front of it is also occupied by another ant . however , when this cell is not occupied by any other ant , the probability of its forward movement to the ant - free cell is @xmath8 or @xmath3 , depending on whether or not the target cell contains pheromone .",
    "thus , @xmath3 ( or @xmath8 ) would be the average speed of a _",
    "free _ ant in the absence ( or presence ) of pheromone . to be consistent with real ant - trails , we assume @xmath9 , as presence of pheromone increases the average speed .",
    "+ _ stage ii : evaporation of pheromones _",
    "+ trail pheromone is volatile .",
    "so , pheromone secreted by an ant will gradually decay unless reinforced by the following ants .",
    "in order to capture this process , we assume that each cell occupied by an ant at the end of stage i also contains pheromone . on the other hand , pheromone in any ` ant - free ' cell",
    "is allowed to evaporate ; this evaporation is also assumed to be a random process that takes place at an average rate of @xmath6 per unit time .",
    "the total amount of pheromone on the trail can fluctuate although the total number @xmath10 of the ants is constant because of the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "in the two special cases @xmath11 and @xmath12 the stationary state of the model becomes identical to that of the tasep with hopping probability @xmath8 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "for a theoretical description of the process we associate two binary variables @xmath13 and @xmath14 with each site @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath13 is the occupation number of ants and takes the value @xmath16 or @xmath17 depending on whether the cell @xmath15 is empty or occupied by an ant .",
    "similarly , @xmath14 is the occupation number of the pheromones , i.e.@xmath18 if the cell @xmath15 contains pheromone ; otherwise , @xmath19 .",
    "thus , we have two subsets of dynamical variables in this model , namely , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in stage",
    "i the subset @xmath22 at the time step @xmath23 is obtained using the full information @xmath24 at time @xmath7 . in stage",
    "ii only the subset @xmath25 is updated so that at the end of stage ii the new configuration @xmath26 at time @xmath23 is obtained .",
    "the rules can be written in a compact form as the coupled equations @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are stochastic variables defined by @xmath30 with the probability @xmath6 and @xmath31 with @xmath32 , and @xmath33 with the probability @xmath34 and @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "this representation is useful for the development of approximation schemes .",
    "in vehicular traffic , usually , the inter - vehicle interactions tend to hinder each other s motion so that the average speed of the vehicles decreases _ monotonically _ with increasing density .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - unidir_res ] where also the fundamental diagram of the nasch model with @xmath4 ( or the tasep with parallel updating ) is shown for different hopping probabilities . note also the particle - hole symmetry of the flow that satisfies @xmath37 .",

    "[ fig - unidir_res ] ) because of the coupling of their dynamics with that of the pheromone .",

    "cluster - size distributions obtained from computer simulations show that the probability of finding isolated ants are always higher than that of finding a cluster of ants occupying nearest - neighbor sites @xcite .",
    "these two apparently contradictory observations can be reconciled by assuming that the ants form `` loose '' clusters in the region 1 .",
    "the term `` loose '' means that there are small gaps in between successive ants in the cluster , and the cluster looks like an usual compact cluster if it is seen from a distance ( fig .",

    "then the hopping probability of all the ants , except the leading one , is assumed to be @xmath65 , while that of the leading one is @xmath63 ( see fig .  [ fig - loose ] ) .",
    "the values of @xmath65 and @xmath63 have to be determined self - consistently . if @xmath6 is small enough , then @xmath65 will be close to @xmath8 because the gap between ants is quite small",
    ". on the other hand , if the density of ants is low enough , then @xmath63 will be very close to @xmath3 because the pheromone dropped by the leading ant would evaporate when the following ant arrives there",
    ".    the typical size of the gap between successive ants in the cluster can be estimated @xcite by considering a simple time evolution beginning with a usual compact cluster ( with local density @xmath62 ) .",
    "the leading ant will move forward by one site over the time interval @xmath66 .",
    "this hopping occurs repeatedly and in the interval of the successive hopping , the number of the following ants which will move one step is @xmath67 .",
    "thus , in the stationary state , strings ( compact clusters ) of length @xmath67 , separated from each other by one vacant site , will produced repeatedly by the ants ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - loose ] ) .",

    "interestingly , the density - independent average gap in the lca is consistent with the flat part ( i.e. , region  1 ) observed in computer simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig - lca ] ) .",
    "in other words , region  1 is dominated by loose clusters .    beyond region 1 , the effect of pheromone of the last ant becomes dominant .",

    "we call this region as region 2 , in which `` looser '' clusters are formed in the stationary state",

    "the effective density @xmath72 in the loose cluster is given by @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , considering the fact that there are no ants in the part of the length @xmath74 , the total flux @xmath75 is @xmath76 where @xmath77 is given by @xmath78    above the density @xmath79 , ants are assumed to be uniformly distributed such that a mean - field approximation works well @xcite .",
    "we call this region as region  3 .",
    "thus we have three typical regions in this model . in region 3",
    ", the relation @xmath80 holds because all the gaps have the same length , i.e.  the state is homogeneous .",

    "this induces a coarsening process such that after long times only one loose cluster survives ( fig .",

    "[ sec_model ] . in the models of bi",
    "- directional ant - traffic the trail consists of _ two _ lanes of cells ( see fig .  [ fig - bi ] ) .",

    "a randomly selected subset of the ants move in the clockwise direction in one lane while the others move counterclockwise in the other lane .",
    "however , ants are allowed neither to take u - turn nor to change lane .",
    "thus , the ratio of the populations of clockwise - moving and anti - clockwise moving ants remains unchanged as the system evolves with time .",
    "all the numerical data presented here are for the _ symmetric _ case where equal number of ants move in the two directions . therefore , the _ average _ flux of outbound and nestbound ants are identical . in all the graphs we plot only the flux of the nestbound ants",
    ".        the rules governing the dropping and evaporation of pheromone in the model of bi - directional ant - traffic are identical to those in the model of uni - directional traffic .",
    "the _ common _",
    "pheromone trail is created and reinforced by both the outbound and nestbound ants .",

[ fig - bi ]",
    ", it moves forward onto the next cell with probability @xmath87 .",
    "since ants do not segregate in perfectly well defined lanes , head - on encounters of oppositely moving individuals occur quite often although the frequency of such encounters and the lane discipline varies from one species of ants to another . in reality , two ants approaching each other feel the hindrance , turn by a small angle to avoid head - on collision @xcite and , eventually , pass each other . at first sight , it may appear that the ants in our model follow perfect lane discipline and , hence , unrealistic .",
    "however , that is not true .",
    "the violation of lane discipline and head - on encounters of oppositely moving ants is captured , effectively , in an indirect manner by assuming @xmath88 .",

    "overtake another left - moving ( right - moving ) ant immediately in front of it in the same lane .",
