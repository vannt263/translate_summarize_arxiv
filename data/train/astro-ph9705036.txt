    "the circumstantial evidence that many soft x  ray transients ( sxts ) contain black holes is now very strong .",
    "several of these systems have been found to have mass functions so large that the compact star s mass exceeds any likely value for the maximum mass of a neutron star . by elimination",
    "it is generally believed that this star must be a black hole .",
    "the incidence of such black  hole candidate systems ( blmxbs ) among sxts with known orbital periods ( 8 out of 14 ) is much greater than any likely estimate of their incidence among persistent lmxbs ( 1 out of 29 ) .",
    "it has been suspected for some time that this is a consequence of the lower mass transfer rates expected in black  hole systems ( mukai 1994 ) . at the rates expected for main  sequence companions",
    "the accretion disks in these systems would be unstable , giving rise to the x  ray outbursts ( e.g. cannizzo et al .",
    "1982 , lin & taam 1984 )",
    ". however this would also be true of most neutron ",
    "star systems ( nlmxbs ) , and yet the majority of these are observed to be persistent . in this context van paradijs ( 1996 ) pointed out the crucial importance of irradiation of the disk by the central accreting source in determining its stability . for a central point source",
    "this leads to a much tighter upper limit on the mass transfer rate allowing transient behavior , which is satisfied by all observed nlmxbs .",
    "following this , king , kolb & burderi ( 1996 ; hereafter kkb ) and king et al .",
    "( 1997 ) showed that this more stringent condition still makes most long  period nlmxbs with a low  mass giant donor ( orbital period @xmath1  d ) transient , whereas short  period nlmxbs with a main  sequence donor ( @xmath2  d ) are transient only if the companion star is significantly nuclear ",
    "evolved before mass transfer begins .",
    "the fact that a non  negligible fraction of such systems are nevertheless observed to be transient imposes very tight constraints on the formation of nlmxbs .",
    "these turn out to hold in practice ( king & kolb 1997 ) , strengthening one s belief in the consistency of the whole picture : nlmxbs can only form with companions sufficiently evolved that many of them have low mass transfer rates and appear as sxts .",
    "however , while irradiation brings clarity to the picture of nlmxbs , it appears to complicate matters for the black  hole systems . for here the formation constraints",
    "are far weaker than for nlmxbs .",
    "in particular survival of the binary after any supernova explosion forming the compact object is virtually guaranteed for a black hole , in stark contrast to the neutron ",
    "star case ; there is no apparent reason why most short  period blmxbs should not form with completely unevolved companion stars .",
    "these systems would have mass transfer rates well above the limit for transient behavior in nlmxbs .",
    "this fact would apparently force us to predict the existence of large numbers of persistent blmxbs , quite contrary to observation .",
    "we address this problem here .",
    "we shall show that the resolution of the apparent paradox is that irradiation differs sharply for neutron ",
    "star and black  hole systems . in the latter case",
    ", the lack of a hard stellar surface means that the central source is the inner region of the accretion disk itself .",
    "the small solid angle subtended by these regions at the outer parts of the disk greatly weakens the stabilizing effect of irradiation , allowing essentially all blmxbs to be transient .",
    "it thus appears that transient behavior gives direct confirmation of the fundamental black ",
    "hole property precisely in systems whose mass estimates already suggest the presence of black holes .",
    "the conditions for disk instability in lmxbs have been considered in detail by van paradijs ( 1996 ) , kkb , and king et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and we summarize their conclusions here . if a steady state exists in which all of the disk is above the hydrogen ionization temperature @xmath3  k , the instability will be suppressed and the source will appear as persistent .",
    "viscous dissipation alone gives an effective temperature @xmath4 , with ( e.g. frank et al .",
    "1992 ) @xmath5 at disk radii @xmath6 much larger than that of the central object ( @xmath7 is the mass of this star , @xmath8 the accretion rate , @xmath9 the gravitational constant and @xmath10 the stefan  boltzmann constant ) .",
    "irradiation plays an important role in potentially raising the disk s surface temperature @xmath11 above @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath12 for a point source at the center of the disk , the irradiation temperature @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the efficiency of rest  mass energy conversion into x  ray heating , @xmath16 is the x  ray albedo , and @xmath17 is the local disk scale height .",
    "since @xmath11 always decreases with @xmath6 , the condition @xmath18 for steady accretion is most stringent at the outer edge @xmath19 of the disk .",
    "we define a critical accretion rate @xmath20 by the equation @xmath21 formally we define also the critical rate @xmath22 in the absence of irradiation ( @xmath23 ) , and the critical rate @xmath24 for fully irradiation ",
    "dominated disks ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "these definitions imply that @xmath26    thus the disk instability is suppressed for @xmath27 and we can try to discriminate between steady and outbursting systems by checking this condition , equating the accretion rate @xmath8 to the mass transfer rate @xmath28 from the companion . in cvs , @xmath29 , and",
    "this procedure correctly predicts that all disk  accreting systems below the period gap should be dwarf novae . in nlmxbs @xmath13 is all  important : the last two factors on the rhs of ( [ eq3 ] ) are typically @xmath30 constant ( see below ) , so @xmath31 falls off only as @xmath32 compared with @xmath33 for @xmath34 . at the outer disk edge @xmath19",
    "we thus expect @xmath35 , giving a critical accretion rate @xmath20 which is typically almost two orders of magnitude lower at a given orbital period for main  sequence donor systems ( see below and fig .  3 ) .",
    "it is sometimes suggested that the outer disk is not affected by irradiation , either because the disk is convex and shadows its outer parts , or because the outer layers form an optically thin corona above the disk ( e.g.  tuchman , mineshige & wheeler 1990 ; cannizzo 1994 ) . in both cases @xmath36 rather than ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "however , the fact that @xmath20 ( from eq .  [ eq4a ] ) rather than @xmath22 separates transient from persistent nlmxbs ( van paradijs 1996 ) , as well as the high optical to x  ray flux ratio observed in lmxbs , is strong evidence for the dominant role of irradiation .    thus assuming that the outer disk temperature is controlled by irradiation , we conclude that short  period neutron ",
    "star transients must have relatively low mass transfer rates .",
    "kkb deduced that they must have companions which are nuclear  evolved before mass transfer begins , even at very short periods where one might otherwise expect a completely unevolved lower ",
    "main  sequence companion . since a significant fraction of nlmxbs",
    "are transient this peculiar condition must follow from the constraints on the formation of nlmxbs .",
    "king & kolb ( 1997 ) indeed show that this is true if the average kick velocity imparted on the neutron star at birth is small . to prevent disruption the binary has to retain at least one  half of its mass after the helium star supernova ( sn ) which forms the neutron star .",
    "the neutron star probably has a mass close to @xmath37 at birth , favoring the survival of systems with a massive companion and a low mass neutron star progenitor . to accommodate such a low mass helium star , the pre ",
    "sn orbit must have been very wide , hence also the post  sn orbit .",
    "the corresponding long detached post - sn evolution causes the secondary to be nuclear  evolved at turn  on of mass transfer .",
    "by contrast it is clear that no such constraint can hold for black  hole systems : even if a supernova occurs , which is unclear , the black hole can easily bind more than one  half of the progenitor mass , thus leaving the companion mass effectively unconstrained .",
    "hence we expect that most short  period blmxbs will form with unevolved main  sequence companions .",
    "magnetic braking and gravitational radiation will then drive mass transfer rates considerably higher than the @xmath20 deduced for nlmxbs above , and one would at first sight expect the vast majority of short  period blmxbs to be persistent x ",
    "ray sources , in complete contradiction to what is observed .",
    "the answer to this difficulty is the fact that irradiation is much weaker if the accreting object is a black hole rather than a neutron star .",
    "this is already mentioned in the seminal paper on accretion disk structure by shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) .",
    "the reason is that in the black  hole case the central object has no hard surface , and so can not act as a point source for irradiation as assumed in the derivation of ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "of course , a comparable luminosity is released in the inner part of the accretion disk surrounding the hole , but this is a flat surface lying in the disk s central plane , and thus almost parallel to the surface layers of the outer regions of the disk .",
    "a full calculation is complex , but it is clear that the solid angle subtended by the inner disk is smaller by a factor @xmath38 than assumed in ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "we can neglect relativistic beaming effects for irradiation of the outer disk ( cunningham 1976 , zhang et al .",
    "1997 ) . for simplicity",
    "we therefore replace ( [ eq3 ] ) by @xmath39 in the black  hole case . with this change , ( [ eq4 ] )",
    "now defines a new ( higher ) critical mass transfer rate @xmath20 , which we must compare with the rates expected from binary evolution .    to evaluate @xmath24",
    "we assume that @xmath19 is about 70% of the primary s roche lobe radius @xmath40 , which in turn is a fraction @xmath41 of the binary separation @xmath42 ; @xmath41 depends only on the ratio @xmath43 of donor mass @xmath44 to primary mass @xmath45 . for @xmath13",
    "we need an estimate of @xmath17 . neglecting internal viscous dissipation and assuming an isothermal vertical disk structure it is easy to show ( e.g.  cunningham 1976 , fukue 1992 ) that @xmath46 if @xmath13 is given by ( [ eq3 ] ) , and @xmath47 with @xmath13 from ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "in reality the disk is not isothermal and the slope is closer to the standard law @xmath48 for unirradiated discs .",
    "we adopt @xmath49 and @xmath50 for the bh case ( [ eq5 ] ) and the neutron star case ( [ eq3 ] ) , respectively ( cf .  burderi , king & szuszkiewicz 1997 ) .",
    "furthermore , observations of lmxbs indicate @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( de jong et al , 1996 , and references therein ) . using these results and @xmath53 in ( [ eq4 ] , [ eq5 ] ) gives @xmath54 with @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "at periods longer than about a day , mass transfer in lmxbs is driven by the nuclear expansion of the secondary .",
    "for low  mass systems with this star on the first giant branch a simple core ",
    "envelope description is available , and gives the mass transfer rate as @xmath58 ( cf .",
    "king et al .",
    "1997 , king 1988 ) . here",
    "@xmath59 is the orbital period in days , @xmath60 the thermal equilibrium mass  radius exponent ( taken as @xmath61 ) and @xmath62 the secondary s roche lobe index .",
    "transient behavior requires @xmath63 , which from ( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq4a ] ) , ( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) translates into a lower limit on @xmath64 for given @xmath65 and @xmath44 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the only persistent bh systems are those with an unusually low bh mass ( @xmath66 ) and high companion mass ( @xmath67 ) , putting them close to mass transfer instability .",
    "such systems evolve quickly to the transient regime as the companion mass is reduced .",
    "this can be seen in fig .  2 , where we show the mass transfer rate as a function of orbital period along typical evolutionary sequences .",
    "this of course is not surprising in the light of the results of king et al .",
    "( 1997 ) who showed that the nlxmb prescription ( [ eq3 ] ) already makes most systems transient .",
    "we conclude that essentially _ all long  period blmxbs should be transient_.    at short binary periods mass transfer is driven by angular momentum loss via magnetic braking and gravitational radiation .",
    "in contrast to the nuclear  evolution case the mass transfer rate here is quite sensitive to the primary mass @xmath45 . first , larger @xmath45 raises the orbital angular momentum of the binary as @xmath68 for @xmath69 : if the angular momentum loss rate @xmath70 is independent of @xmath45 ( as is the case for magnetic stellar wind braking ) the transfer rate is reduced as @xmath71 , on the other hand we know that angular momentum loss via gravitational radiation actually increases , with @xmath72 . using the form of verbunt & zwaan ( 1981 ) for the magnetic braking rate , with the radius of gyration set to @xmath73 and the calibration parameter to unity , and the standard form ( e.g. landau & lifschitz 1958 ) for the gravitational radiation losses , the mass transfer rate is @xmath74 , with @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 as above ) .    in fig .",
    "3 we plot the mass transfer rate and critical rate ( [ eq6 ] ) as a function of orbital period for representative evolutionary sequences with an unevolved secondary for different initial bh mass @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "magnetic braking is assumed to operate only as long as the secondary has a radiative core .",
    "this leads to a detached phase ( `` period gap '' ) when the secondary becomes fully convective , followed by the resumption of mass transfer below the period gap .",
    "blmxbs with unevolved donors above the detached phase ( @xmath81  h ) are transient if the bh mass is @xmath82 , whereas at shorter periods ( @xmath83  h ) blmxbs are transient for any reasonable bh mass .",
    "we note , however , that the critical transfer rate is only slightly higher than the secular mean transfer rate in systems close to the period minimum and the upper edge of the detached phase for all bh masses . in view of the uncertainties in ( [ eq6 ] ) , one would therefore not be surprised by the appearance of persistent blmxbs ( even with a @xmath84 primary ) at these periods .",
    "we can get a rough analytic representation of this result by introducing a number of simplifications : using @xmath85 the ratio @xmath41 can be obtained to better than @xmath86 for @xmath87 from @xmath88 , the secondary s roche lobe radius in units of @xmath42 , which in turn is given by @xmath89 ( paczyski 1971 ) .",
    "thus we have from ( [ eq6 ] ) @xmath90 we then set @xmath91 , @xmath92 and assume @xmath93 .    for systems above the gap ( @xmath94 ) we furthermore assume @xmath95 and define the parameter @xmath96 , where @xmath97 denotes the mass of a main  sequence secondary which fills its roche lobe at a given orbital period ( @xmath98 )",
    ". then we find from ( [ eq7a ] ) and ( [ eq10a ] ) as a condition for transient behavior @xmath99 thus the minimum primary mass becomes even smaller if the main  sequence secondary is somewhat nuclear  evolved ( @xmath100 ) .    for systems with a fully convective secondary ( @xmath101 ) we have @xmath102 .",
    "detailed models show that along the pre  period minimum evolution the relation @xmath103 holds , for any bh mass .",
    "the constant @xmath104 is @xmath105 for secondaries with a helium content @xmath106 , and slightly larger for larger @xmath107 ( as would be the case if the secondary was nuclear ",
    "evolved at turn  on of mass transfer at longer @xmath65 ) .",
    "hence we find from ( [ eq7a ] ) and ( [ eq10b ] ) @xmath108 as a condition for transient behavior , insensitive to @xmath45 and always fulfilled .",
    "it has recently been suggested that black hole sxts might be inefficient accretors in quiescence .",
    "the inner part of the accretion disk would be replaced by a quasi ",
    "spherical ( `` advective '' ) accretion flow taking the matter into the black hole before it has time to radiate ( narayan , mcclintock & yi 1996 ; cf .",
    "katz 1977 ; begelman 1978 ) .",
    "it is unclear how the sxt outbursts themselves would be produced in this picture ; but nevertheless it is important to note that our criterion @xmath109 refers only to the _ mean _ accretion rate , i.e. a system is assumed to be transient if steady disk flow with an accretion rate equal to the mass transfer rate is unstable .",
    "our considerations here would only be affected if this ( hypothetical ) steady flow was itself advection  dominated . in this case there",
    "would clearly be no question of irradiation stabilizing the disc .",
    "thus our conclusion that black hole disks are unstable because the fundamental property of these objects weakens the irradiation effect would be still more strongly justified .",
    "irradiation of the accretion disk surface by the central source has a determining effect on transient behavior . in neutron ",
    "star low  mass x  ray binaries this confines transient behavior to systems with extremely low accretion rates .",
    "the very strong formation constraints for neutron ",
    "star binaries with low ",
    "mass companions nevertheless mean that a significant fraction of these systems are transient .",
    "the much weaker contraints on forming black  hole systems would at first sight suggest that very few of them would have mass transfer rates low enough to be transient .",
    "the fact that the vast majority of black  hole candidates are nevertheless transient shows that irradiation is weakened by the fundamental property that black holes have no hard surface ; that is , they are black .",
