    "we assume that the two - dimensional fluid is partitioned into regions that can be identified as either `` burned '' or `` unburned''we use `` burned '' generically to refer to the region bounded by an outward propagating front .",

    ", if our front is an autocatalytic chemical reaction front , this limit requires that the diffusion rate is small compared with the reaction rate .",
    "we assume that each front element ( infinitessimal piece of the one - dimensional front ) propagates perpendicular to the front at a speed @xmath31 measured in the comoving fluid frame , thereby expanding the burned region . to be clear , we require that this speed @xmath31 be isotropic , homogeneous , and time - independent .",
    "note that we have implicitly assumed that the front elements are non - interacting ( fronts do not change their behavior when faced with a collision ) , and their motion does not depend on the front curvature .",

    "the evolution of a reacted region can be modeled using the modified fkpp equation @xcite , @xmath32 where @xmath7 is the local fraction of reaction products , @xmath33 is the reaction time - scale , @xmath34 describes the reaction kinetics , and @xmath35 is the diffusion constant . we require the sharp front limit of this equation so that the fronts dividing burned from unburned regions are well defined .",

    "( [ eqn : fkpp ] ) ( in the sharp front limit ) for one forcing period . here",
    "@xmath38 is the collection of subsets of @xmath37 .",
    "the reaction dynamics propagates this point stimulation into some finite region that is all the while stretched and folded by the flow dynamics .",
    "we extend the map @xmath39 to act on regions by defining @xmath40 such that @xmath41 .",
    "the intuition is simply that if stimulation @xmath42 evolves to region @xmath43 and @xmath44 to @xmath45 , then stimulating both @xmath42 and @xmath44 will result in the reacted domain @xmath46 .",
    "note that @xmath39 acting on sets is not one - to - one , i.e. , two distinct burned regions can evolve forward to the same burned region .",
    "this differs from the passive case in which @xmath11 acting on sets was invertible ( sec .",
    "[ sec : turnstile_review ] ) .    as shown in",
    ", the sharp - front fkpp equation is equivalent to the g - equation , @xmath47 where only the level set @xmath48 , and not the value of this field , has any physical meaning .",
    "this level set represents the boundary between reacted and unreacted regions . while one can solve this pde effectively by focusing on the vicinity of the level set , we wish to make an explicit dimension reduction .      instead of integrating eq .",
    "( [ eqn : geqn ] ) , we shall use an equivalent formulation @xcite in which each front element evolves independently under the following three - dimensional ode ,    @xmath49    [ eqn:3dode ]    the variables @xmath50 and @xmath51 denote the position and orientation of each front element .",
    "the prescribed fluid velocity is given by @xmath52 .",

    ", we use the variables @xmath53 and @xmath54 to indicate the tangent to the front element and the normal direction ( propagation direction ) , respectively . finally , @xmath55 and repeated indices are summed .",
    "this ode representation allows us to apply the tools of low - dimensional dynamical systems theory .",
    "this ode can also be derived more intuitively .",
    "the total translational motion of a front element is the vector sum fluid velocity plus the front propagation velocity in the fluid frame ( eq .  ( [ eqn:3dodea ] ) ) .",
    "the change in orientation is determined entirely geometrically .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn:3dodeb ] ) describes the angular velocity of a material line embedded in the fluid .",
    "we define @xmath56 , the evolution of front elements , by integrating eq .",
    "( [ eqn:3dode ] ) for one forcing period .",
    "note that @xmath57 is the active extension of @xmath11 ( the advection map for a point ) .",
    "the `` 2 '' and `` 3 '' subscripts emphasize that these maps operate on two- and three - dimensional phase spaces .",
    "finally , we also use @xmath58 to denote the iterate of the curve @xmath59 which is the outward oriented boundary curve ( in @xmath0-space ) of burned region @xmath60 .",
    "here we define the turnstile relevant for active fluids in terms of the behavior of sets , much like was done for the advective turnstile .",
    "the essential differences arise due to the everywhere - expanding property of the map @xmath39 .    because of the asymmetry of the map @xmath39 ( unburned fluid can become burned but not vice versa ) there exists an asymmetry in the lobe definitions depending on whether the burned region is to the left or the right of the transport boundary . for the remainder of this paper",
    ", we consider left - to - right propagation . the right - to - left case is defined analogously .",
    "we begin with the escape process .",
    "since advection maps points to points , any given point begins and ends either right or left of the transport boundary , and so crossing ( e.g. , escaping ) is well defined .",
    "however with the addition of front propagation , points map to regions under @xmath39 and so a choice arises ; is a point stimulation , which immediately gives rise to a burned region , said to escape when _ all _ of the region crosses the transport boundary ? or instead when _ any _ of the region crosses ?",
    "looking to physical examples such as autocatalytic chemical reactions , fires , algae blooms , infections , etc . , it seems reasonable that the more interesting definition is when _ any _ crosses ; we are generally not concerned whether an _ entire _ wildfire crosses the firebreak .",
    "this motivates the following definitions of escape lobes in the active system ( compare eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : passive_lobe_defs_pts ] ) ) , @xmath61 the escape lobe @xmath30 is the set of all points left of the transport boundary such that the evolution of each point stimulation under @xmath39 has some intersection with the area right of the transport boundary .",
    "the escape lobe @xmath62 is the set of all points right of the transport boundary that may be reached in one iterate by some point stimulation on the left .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : escape ] .",
    "the capture process is slightly subtler due to the asymmetry in the burning process ( compare eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : passive_lobe_defs_pts ] ) ) , @xmath63 the capture lobe @xmath29 is the set of all points right of the boundary such that the evolution of this point stimulation under @xmath39 lies completely on the left . in other words",
    ", @xmath29 contains all those stimulations on the right that do not contribute to the subsequent burning of the @xmath10 .",
    "the capture lobe @xmath64 is the set of all points on the left not reachable in one period by any stimulation on the left , i.e. reachable only by a stimulation on the right .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : capture ] .",
    "we reiterate that , just as in the passive case , these set - based definitions of lobes are well - defined with respect to an arbitrary transport boundary .",
    "however , we again wish to make use of the dynamic structure of the system in choosing the transport boundary in a natural way .",
    "the burning lobe definitions are phrased in terms of mapping properties of point stimulations .",
    "experimentally , this definition makes good sense because a point s lobe membership is based on the results of an elementary experiment  the stimulation of just this point ( or as close to it as possible ) .",
    "however , making use of the extension of @xmath39 to regions , we can rephrase the definition of the burning lobes . the first two , @xmath62 and @xmath65 are relatively intuitive , @xmath66 where @xmath67 indicates the set complement of @xmath60 .      in order to similarly describe the other two lobes",
    ", we need a map inverse .",
    "since @xmath39 is many - to - one , we must _ choose _ an inverse .",
    "given a final burned region @xmath68 there are an infinite number of initial regions @xmath60 for which @xmath69",
    ". two useful senses of inverse are derived from considering extreme cases .",
    "we define the _ loose _ and _ tight _ inverses respectively as , @xmath70 the loose preimage is the set of all stimulations that intersect the target , while the tight preimage is the set of only those stimulations that map entirely into the target .",
    "it follows that the tight preimage is a subset of the loose one , @xmath71 .",
    "( this motivates the overline versus underline notation . )",
    "given any @xmath60 , the loose preimage always has non - zero area while the tight preimage may be empty .",
    "note that @xmath72 and @xmath73 form a disjoint partition of the entire space .",
    "we may now write , @xmath74",
    "we now review the necessary features of burning invariant manifolds @xcite . while incompressible flows have only hyperbolic ( su ) and elliptic ( ss ) fixed points , all fixed - point stability types ( sss , ssu , suu , uuu ) are possible in front element dynamics ( eq .  ( [ eqn:3dode ] ) ) .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , we will concern ourselves only with the suu and ssu stability types , and only with invariant manifolds of their singleton dimensions .",
    "we will refer to these one - dimensional objects as stable and unstable _ burning invariant manifolds _ ( bims ) , respectively .",
    "previous theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated that unstable bims are one - sided barriers to front propagation in fluid flows , similar to traditional advective invariant manifolds ( fig .",
    "[ fig : time_indep_conts_w_bims ] ) .        while in many ways",
    "bims function like their passive counterparts , there are some important differences .",
    "while advective invariant manifolds are codimension 1 , bims are codimension 2 since they exist a three - dimensional phase space .",
    "( note that the figures in this work portray _",
    "projections _ of bims into @xmath1-space . )",
    "it is then not obvious how bims can function as barriers .",
    "the answer is that only a subset of curves @xmath75 correspond to fronts .",
    "( here @xmath76 is the @xmath1 euclidean length along the curve . ) the _ front - compatibility criterion _ requires that @xmath77 everywhere equals the angle @xmath78 describing the local tangent to the curve s @xmath1-projection , @xmath79 .",
    "any parameterized curve in @xmath1-space , including the boundary curve of a burned region , uniquely lifts to a curve in @xmath0-space that satisfies the front - compatibility - criterion .",
    "we shall use the term _ front _ for both the curve in @xmath1-space and its lift to @xmath0-space .",
    "it has been shown that bims satisfy the front - compatibility criterion and so are ( locally ) fronts . as such , bims are also subject to the _ no - passing lemma_no front can overtake another front from behind . when the leading front is an invariant one ( a bim ) , the other is bounded by it . because unstable bims are transversely stable , not only do they bound fronts , but",
    "fronts also converge to them making unstable bims evident in observations of the dynamics .",
    "a similar effect is observed in passive flows @xcite .    just as fronts have a burning direction ,",
    "so do bims .",
    "a front near a bim with the same burning direction will not pass through .",
    "conversely , a front with burning direction opposite a bim can pass through with no singularity in its motion .",
    "this is why bims are referred to as _ one - sided _ barriers .    in the full @xmath0-space ,",
    "bim are smooth , non - intersecting curves .",
    "however , when projected into the @xmath1-plane , bims have cusps and self - intersections .",
    "these cusps are physically meaningful in that fronts can wrap around them .",
    "therefore a bim loses its bounding behavior at a cusp .",
    "having established that bims are barriers to front propagation , just as advective invariant manifolds are barriers to fluid transport , it might seem that the analogy is complete and all that remains is to construct an active transport boundary from bim segments .",
    "however , in the next few sections we illustrate several new features of the active system that require consideration before the analogy is made complete .",
    "we proceed by first analyzing the @xmath80 regime .",
    "consider finite segments of a generic advective invariant manifold tangle . then there exists a @xmath31 small enough such that taking the advective manifolds into the left- and right - burning bims by a continuous deformation generates no new intersections in these finite segments ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : advective_turnstile_split ] ) . examining",
    "this simplest topological case reveals two important features in the composition of the active transport boundary .      as @xmath31 increases from @xmath81 , each stable and unstable advective invariant manifold splits into nearby left- and right - burning bims ( fig .",
    "[ fig : advective_turnstile_split ] ) . in joining segments of these bims to form a transport boundary ,",
    "each offers a choice of left- or right - burning .    , bims follow near the advective manifolds for a long length .",
    "@xmath82    figure  [ fig : coorientation ] illustrates these four choices . in case ( a )",
    ", the bim segments are both rightward burning , corresponding to a burned region impinging from the left .",
    "case ( c ) corresponds to the boundary of a region on the right .",
    "because in each of these two cases , the two bim segments agree on a burning direction , we call these configurations of joined segments _ co - oriented_. in cases ( b ) and ( d ) , the bim segments chosen are not co - oriented , and do not correspond to the oriented boundary of a burned @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "more precisely , consider the two front elements involved in the intersection and their respective directions of propagation @xmath83 .",
    "for each , denote by @xmath84 the direction tangent to the corresponding bim segment and oriented away from the intersection .",
    "if the two cross - products @xmath85 are of opposite sign , the segments are co - oriented .    ]    if we were to choose a non - co - oriented configuration ( say case ( b ) ) , then a burned region abutting this curve from the left ( right ) will burn through the stable ( unstable ) bim segment immediately . consequently , neither this bim segment , nor its iterate would bound the iterated burned region . therefore , our first new requirement of the active transport boundary is that it be composed of bim segments that are co - oriented . for the remainder of this paper",
    "we analyze fronts progressing from left to right as in fig .",
    "[ fig : coorientation](a ) .      in the advective turnstile",
    ", an intersection between stable and unstable invariant manifolds must map to another such intersection .",
    "this fact allows us to neatly equate the boundary segments of a lobe iterate with the iterates of the initial boundary segments .    in the active system ,",
    "an intersection in the @xmath1-projection of two bims is not an intersection in @xmath0-space .",
    "generically , the bim projections meet with different orientations and so two _ different _ front elements participate in their @xmath1-intersection .",
    "more importantly , these two front elements evolve forward splitting apart in @xmath1-space ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scissor_and_con](a ) ) .",
    "this might seem to foil an active generalization of the turnstile .",
    "however , the bounding property of both advective and active invariant manifolds is not a pointwise property , but a property of curve segments .",
    "this implies that the functional intersection is not necessarily lost ; we can define an _ intersection continuation _ by tracking the continuous evolution of the intersection of the two bims . figure  [ fig : scissor_and_con](a ) shows that while the two front elements initially involved in the intersection always separate , a natural continuation of this intersection can be defined .",
    "this continuation outruns each of the two front elements by a factor of @xmath86 in the comoving fluid frame .    figure  [ fig : scissor_and_con](a ) is compatible with two different burned regions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : scissor_and_con](b ) , the burned region has a _ concave corner _ while the region in fig .",

    ", we need to properly join the two original front segments at the corner . remembering that fronts are curves in @xmath0-space , it is clear that the two front segments alone form a discontinuous curve .",
    "we join these two front segments with a _ connection _ @xmath87 that is simply a straight line connecting the @xmath51 values of the two front elements at the corner . since @xmath88 , there are two distinct intervals between any two @xmath51 values ; the physically correct choice is the shorter of the two intervals .",
    "the two segments joined with the connection are now a continuous front in @xmath0-space .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : scissor_and_con](b ) , the connection evolves into the arc of a circle and is immediately burned past by both front segments .",
    "further , the front segments partially overtake each other sending finite portions into the reacted region . the boundary of the final reacted region @xmath89 is a subset of the evolved front , @xmath90 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : scissor_and_con](c ) , the connection unfolds in the same way , but it remains on the boundary of the reacted region , @xmath91 .",
    "this connection , functioning like a point stimulation made at the convex corner , is a boundary between burned and unburned that is not the iterate of , or continuation of , either original front segment ; it generates `` new boundary '' .",

    "this concept will lead to the second requirement of the active transport boundary .",

    "an active constituent in the ocean , such as plankton , would be transported into the bay by the advective turnstile while simultaneously growing outward , pushing past the advective invariant manifolds to the bims defining the burning turnstile .",
    "suppose the goal is to protect the bay by applying an algaecide to the surface of the water in synchrony with the tide .",

    "there are several strategies that may be suggested .",
    "first is to apply a strip of algaecide spanning the mouth of the bay in a rectangle .",
    "while this protocol and simple to implement , it does not take advantage of our understanding of the dynamical structure , and as a result either fails to prevent the algae invasion , or uses an excess of suppressant .    a better strategy attempts to make use of oceanic flow structures . in particular",
    ", one could focus the treatment on the advective @xmath30 or @xmath62 lobe . enlarging this treatment area uniformly around the advective lobe yields an effective and more efficient strategy . as a first approximation",
    ", one could enlarge outward a distance @xmath173 .",
    "while this is a reasonable suggestion , it fails to account for the fact that as the front evolves , its continuous propagation beyond the corresponding passive trajectories places the front into regions of flow different from those experienced by the passive trajectories . in other words ,",
    "the gradient of the flow feeds back into the evolution of the front and in this way leads to lobes that differ from simple uniform enlargements . during the course of one tidal cycle ,",
    "the algae s growth pushes it just beyond an advective stable manifold .",
    "this grants the algae access to a region of fluid that was entirely inaccessible to passive trajectories .",
    "this small breach can then proliferate into a significant bloom .",
    "we propose that the best strategy , given the assumptions , is to apply the algaecide to an burning escape lobe @xmath30 or @xmath62 .",
    "this protocol eliminates exactly that algae which may transgress or has transgressed the transport boundary . which of the two is the most efficient ( smallest area ) depends on the details of the flow .",
    "figure  [ fig : reaction_suppression ] illustrates these three protocols ( and control with no suppression ) .",
    "the rectangular protocol clearly fails to prevent the rightward propagation of the front , despite the rectangular area being fully twice that of the larger escape lobe @xmath62 . in contrast , both lobe - based protocols are able to prevent the front propagation , using significantly less suppressant .",
    "( note that the discrete grid introduces some noise , which we accommodate by increasing the suppression regions by about 2 cell widths . )    for advective transport , one can readily show that the @xmath122 defined by a pip connecting stable and unstable manifolds minimizes the flux across the @xmath122 .",
    "a small perturbation to such a @xmath122 results in an advective flux that is larger than ( or equal to ) the original flux . we conjecture that an analogous statement is true concerning the @xmath122 for front propagation .",
    "this question , however , is more subtle than in the passive case and will be addressed in a future publication .",
    "we have demonstrated how the turnstile , a fundamental construct in the theory of passive fluid transport , is generalized to fronts propagating in a flowing fluid .",
    "this burning turnstile is originally defined in terms of the evolution of point stimulations in the active fluid .",
    "the modified turnstile exhibits several features distinct from its passive counterpart .",
    "first , the burning turnstile is bounded by bims , _ one - sided _ barriers to front propagation .",
    "second , to form a meaningful transport boundary from finite segments of stable and unstable bims , the bims relative orientations must be consistent .",
    "third , the burning pips used to join the stable and unstable bims are only intersections of the bims when projected to the @xmath1 plane .",
    "fourth , this implies that a segment of the boundary of either @xmath29 or @xmath65 does not consist of bim segments , depending on whether the pip is concave or convex , respectively .",
    "finally , the areas of the lobes are not preserved and the relations between @xmath174 and @xmath62 and between @xmath168 are @xmath65 are more complicated than the advective case .",
    "increasing the front propagation speed can change the topology of the lobes , most notably by generically introducing swallowtails into the lobe boundaries .",
    "these swallowtails excise a portion of a lobe s bim boundary . a large enough propagation speed can even remove a burning pip entirely .",
    "if no such pips remain , the turnstile formulation can no longer be applied .    to illustrate the utility of this theoretical framework",
