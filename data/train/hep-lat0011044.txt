    "large-@xmath2 spin - flavor symmetry has proven to be a useful symmetry for studying the properties of baryons in qcd  @xcite .",
    "baryon observables can be analyzed in an expansion involving a complete operator basis with each operator transforming according to a definite representation under the unbroken spin @xmath3 flavor subgroup and suppressed by a definite power of @xmath0 . from the @xmath0 expansion , it is possible to determine the symmetry structure of @xmath0 corrections which account for deviations from the large-@xmath2 spin - flavor limit . by including additional parameters to account for explicit flavor symmetry breaking ,",
    "one obtains a combined operator expansion in @xmath0 and flavor symmetry breaking .",
    "the symmetry relations which occur when one neglects individual operators in the combined @xmath0 and flavor - symmetry breaking expansion are predicted to hold at a definite order in @xmath0 and @xmath1 flavor symmetry breaking .",
    "the hierarchy of symmetry relations predicted by this procedure results in a nontrivial pattern for baryons in qcd since @xmath4 and the @xmath1 flavor symmetry breaking @xmath5 are comparable in magnitude , so the pattern of relations is not dominated by either @xmath0 or @xmath6 , and neither parameter can be neglected relative to the other .",
    "the hierarchy of baryon mass relations predicted by the combined expansion in @xmath0 and flavor symmetry breaking has been obtained for the lowest - lying baryon spin - flavor multiplet , which is the @xmath7 of @xmath8 for @xmath9 colors and @xmath10 light quark flavors .",
    "this spin - flavor multiplet contains the spin-@xmath11 octet and spin-@xmath12 decuplet baryon spin @xmath3 flavor representations .",
    "the mass hierarchy predicted for these ground - state baryons is particularly predictive since the expansion extends to relative order @xmath13 in the @xmath0 expansion and to third order in @xmath1 flavor symmetry breaking .",
    "the mass spectrum of the spin-@xmath11 octet and the spin-@xmath12 decuplet baryons is in striking accord with the @xmath0 hierarchy .",
    "suppression factors of @xmath14 are clearly evident in the data , which provides the strongest single piece of evidence for the relevance of the @xmath0 expansion for qcd baryons where @xmath14 .",
    "even more importantly , the @xmath0 expansion resolves the long - standing puzzle of why certain famous mass relations of the spin-@xmath11 octet and spin-@xmath12 decuplet baryons , such as the gell - mann  okubo formula , gell - mann s equal spacing rule , the okubo formula and the coleman - glashow relation , work so extraordinarily well , which is to say , better than one would have expected based on flavor symmetry breaking suppression factors alone .",
    "the point is that the operators in the baryon mass expansion which are highly suppressed in @xmath1 flavor symmetry breaking parameters also are suppressed by powers of @xmath0 , so that , generically , mass relations which are highly suppressed in flavor are highly suppressed in @xmath0 as well .",
    "this proceedings provides a brief description of progress that has been made in understanding the mass spectrum of qcd baryons in an @xmath15 expansion in @xmath0 and flavor symmetry breaking .",
    "a brief description of the @xmath0 operator expansion for baryons is provided , with the example of the operator expansion for the @xmath16 masses of the ground state baryons presented in detail .",
    "evidence of the @xmath0 mass hierarchy of the baryon octet and decuplet is obvious for the @xmath16 baryon mass combinations , and recent experimental evidence supporting the predicted @xmath0 hierarchy in the @xmath17 sector is noted for the isospin - breaking coleman - glashow mass splitting . finally , the extension of the @xmath0 expansion to baryons containing a single heavy quark in heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) is summarized briefly , and then applied to the charm and bottom baryon mass spectra . using the @xmath0 expansion , a prediction was made for the @xmath18 mass valid to a precision of a couple mev , which has recently been confirmed experimentally .",

    "the baryon mass operator transforms as a spin singlet .",
    "@xmath1 flavor symmetry breaking proportional to the parameter @xmath6 transforms as the eighth component of an @xmath1 octet , so the baryon mass operator expansion also contains @xmath1 flavor - symmetry breaking operators which extend to third order in @xmath1 breaking and transform as the @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 representations of @xmath1 .",
    "the baryon @xmath16 masses can be organized according to their @xmath1 representation , @xmath46 with @xmath0 operator expansions @xmath47 where each operator in the @xmath0 expansion is understood to be accompanied by a coefficient , which has been suppressed in eq .",

    "each mass operator occurs at a definite order in @xmath0 and @xmath6 and corresponds to one specific mass splitting , so the combined expansion in @xmath0 and @xmath6 predicts a hierarchy of @xmath16 masses  @xcite . a similar analysis can be performed for the @xmath17 and @xmath56 mass splittings of the octet and decuplet baryons .",
    "the analysis introduces two new parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 which are @xmath17 and @xmath56 flavor symmetry breaking parameters , respectively .",
    "the two parameters are expected to be similar in magnitude .    figure  1 plots sixteen independent mass splittings of the spin-@xmath11 octet and the spin-@xmath12 decuplet .",

    "the first seven points in figure  1 , the @xmath16 mass splittings , are in striking agreement with the hierarchy predicted by the @xmath0 and @xmath6 expansions .",
    "the singlet mass splitting of relative order @xmath72 is comparable in magnitude to the octet mass splitting of relative order @xmath73 .",
    "the three flavor - octet mass splittings proportional to one power of @xmath6 are in accord with the predicted @xmath0 hierarchy of @xmath0 , @xmath72 , and @xmath13 .",
    "if one did not know about the @xmath0 expansion and arbitrarily looked at three different flavor - octet mass    splittings , they would generically all contain some portion of the @xmath0 mass combination and therefore be of this relative magnitude .",
    "only when examining the linear combinations picked out by the @xmath0 expansion does the @xmath0 hierarchy become apparent .",
    "the two flavor-@xmath74 mass splittings are proportional to two powers of @xmath6 , and occur at relative orders @xmath72 and @xmath13 in the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "these two flavor-@xmath74 mass splittings of the @xmath0 expansion are linear combinations of the gell - mann ",
    "okubo flavor-@xmath74 mass splitting of the spin-@xmath11 baryon octet @xmath75 and the flavor-@xmath74 equal spacing rule mass splitting of the spin-@xmath12 baryon decuplet @xmath76 since these two famous mass splittings are linear combinations of the two @xmath0 mass splittings , they are both suppressed by a factor of @xmath72 in addition to the flavor suppression factor @xmath77 .",
    "thus , the @xmath0 expansion predicts that these flavor-@xmath74 mass splittings are about an order of magnitude smaller than expected from an analysis of flavor - symmetry breaking alone .",
    "the single flavor-@xmath78 mass splitting @xmath79 is third order in @xmath1 flavor symmetry breaking @xmath80 and relative order @xmath13 in the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "the experimental data clearly show that the mass splitting is suppressed by a greater factor than expected from flavor - symmetry breaking alone , and the observed suppression is consistent with the @xmath0 hierarchy",
    ". a better measurement of this splitting would reduce the experimental error bar and test the @xmath13 prediction of the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "there also is clear evidence for the @xmath0 hierarchy in the @xmath17 mass splittings  @xcite .",
    "a new , very precise , measurement of @xmath81  @xcite significantly reduces the errors on the @xmath17 mass combinations plotted in fig .  1 .",

    "is predicted to be of relative order @xmath84 , or suppressed by a factor of @xmath60 relative to the leading @xmath17 mass splittings , the eighth and ninth points , which are of relative order @xmath66 .",
    "a similar suppression factor is predicted and observed for the @xmath17 mass splitting that is plotted as the tenth point in fig .  1 .",
    "the leading @xmath56 mass splitting , point fourteen , is also in line with the prediction of the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "remaining points have large error bars .",
    "improved measurements of a number of isospin mass splittings , particularly of the @xmath52 baryons , would reduce these errors and provide a further test of the @xmath0 hierarchy .",
    "large-@xmath2 baryons containing a single heavy quark respect a large-@xmath2 @xmath85 spin - flavor symmetry  @xcite with light - quark generators @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 and heavy - quark generators @xmath89 light - quark spin - flavor symmetry is valid in the @xmath90 limit , whereas the heavy - quark spin - flavor symmetry is valid in the large-@xmath2 limit and the heavy - quark limit of hqet .    the @xmath0 operator expansion for a baryon with @xmath91 flavor quantum numbers involves operator products which are at most @xmath31-body in the heavy - quark generators and at most @xmath92-body in the light - quark generators .",
    "light - quark generators are accompanied by a factor @xmath0 , and heavy - quark generators are accompanied by a factor of @xmath0 and @xmath93 since the heavy - quark spin - flavor generators separately violate large-@xmath2 heavy - quark spin - flavor symmetry and heavy - quark spin - flavor symmetry of hqet .",
    "heavy - quark flavor symmetry breaking for the @xmath94 and @xmath95 baryons enters through the generators @xmath96 whereas light - quark @xmath1 flavor symmetry breaking enters through light - quark generators which transform as the eighth or third component of an @xmath1 octet .",

    "presently , the extraction of the @xmath102 mass using this mass relation is dominated by experimental uncertainties in the @xmath104 mass , whose pdg value of @xmath105 is @xmath106 away from the new cleo measurement of @xmath107 .",
    "these two experimental values yield central values for the @xmath102 of 2768 and 2777 mev , respectively .",
    "finally , all of the @xmath95 baryons ( given the measured @xmath108 mass ) can be predicted from the charm baryon masses to a precision of about @xmath109 mev , which is set by the accuracy of the worst @xmath94 and @xmath95 mass relation .",
    "observation of some of the @xmath95 baryons will allow a determination of the remaining unobserved @xmath95 baryon masses to greater precision .",
