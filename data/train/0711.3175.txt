    "string theories inspired particle physicists to solve the problems present in the sm by introducing extra dimensions .",
    "arkani - hamed , dimopolulos and dvali ( add ) @xcite proposed existence of @xmath14 large extra - dimensions with factorizable geometry . in their construction sm fields",
    "are confined to our four - dimensional world . in this paper",
    "we focus instead on the randall - sundrum framework which uses the idea of a warped extra dimension @xcite .",
    "both scenarios predict existence of kk gravitons .",
    "coupling of each individual add graviton to the sm field is suppressed by the planck scale , but summation over almost continuous spectrum of them compensates for the suppression .",
    "rs gravitons , in contrast , have their masses and couplings at the tev scale and therefore should appear in experiment as widely separated resonances .",
    "the original rs model as well as all of its extensions are based on a slice of ad@xmath15 space . at the endpoints of this five - dimensional space two branes",
    "are placed which are usually labeled as an ultraviolet ( uv ) brane and a planck brane and the large hierarchy of scales is solved by a geometrical exponential factor .",
    "postulating modest - sized @xmath16 dimension with radius r and curvature k the tev / planck @xmath17 ratio of scales can be numerically obtained by setting kr @xmath1811 .",
    "if we assume that all sm fields are localized on the tev brane , higher dimensional operators in the 5d effective theory will give large contributions to flavor changing neutral current processes and electroweak precision observables . also to solve hierarchy in the observed",
    "fermion masses we need to have different fermion yukawa couplings for different flavors",
    ". a natural way to accomplish this proposed by @xcite is to allow sm fields to propagate in the extra dimension . in this scenario",
    "light fermions are localized near the planck brane while heavier ones near the tev brane and , thus , the problem of fermion masses is solved since higgs field , localized at the tev brane will couple weakly to former and strongly to latter fermions . as a consequence ,",
    "the kk graviton whose profile is peaked at the tev brane will couple mostly to the top quark as well as to the higgs ( or , by equivalence theorem , to the longitudinal w and z bosons )  @xcite .",
    "thus , the promising channels to observe rs gravitons are those where produced gravitons are decaying to fields localized near the tev brane .",
    "search for the kk gravitons using its decays to the top quarks was performed in @xcite .",
    "the 4-lepton signal through the decay to a pair of @xmath1 s was studied in @xcite .",
    "reconstruction possibility of the z s via their leptonic decays makes this a uniquely clean mode .",
    "both analyses concluded that with @xmath10 100 - 300@xmath8 of data provided by lhc the gravitons of masses up to @xmath102 tev can be probed .",
    "in this paper we will study purely leptonic @xmath19 and semileptonic modes , i.e. ( @xmath20)(@xmath21 ) from the decay of @xmath22 pair .",
    "our analysis suggests that we may be able to observe rs kk graviton mode with mass up to about @xmath10 3 - 3.5 tev as well as to separate its contribution from that of the rs kk @xmath23 ; thus , if they exist at all , providing strong evidence in favor of the rs framework  @xcite .",
    "our strategy relies on the fact that in the class of models we are working @xmath24 for the lightest kk masses of the graviton and the gauge fields @xcite .",
    "thus , since @xmath23 has only 2/3 of the graviton mass and since cross - section falls quickly as we go up in mass of the resonance being produced , we may expect that the gauge kk modes would be more accessible  @xcite .",
    "then , by making use of the above relationship between masses , we may look for the presence of the graviton in some other mode(s ) where they could be well separated .",
    "in particular , we will show that using the purely leptonic mode to observe kk @xmath23 ( where graviton contribution will be hard to see due to its higher mass ) we then may use the semileptonic mode with the knowledge of @xmath23 mass to pin down the graviton contribution .",
    "however , the last channel is challenging as it requires to distinguish two collimated jets from highly boosted w boson from one qcd jet . therefore , in addition to ww irreducible sm background , we include w + 1 jet background in our study for this mode .",
    "the reason for the enhancement of the graviton signal in the ww channel compared to the zz mode lies in the fact that the branching ratio ( br ) to a @xmath22 pair is twice as big as the br to a @xmath1 pair . in addition to that , br@xmath25 2/3 and br@xmath26 compared to br @xmath27 , where @xmath28 indicates each type of the lepton , not sum over them  @xcite . also , it is worth mentioning that a rs graviton decays to top quark pairs about @xmath29 of the time compared to @xmath30 for a @xmath22 pair .",
    "the important point for the @xmath3 final state , however , is that the kk gluon couples to the top pair as well and surpasses graviton production  @xcite .",
    "also , the reconstruction of such energetic tops far away from the @xmath3 production threshold might be an additional challenge .",
    "the main experimental problem in using the ww final state with subsequent leptonic decays is the presence of one or two neutrinos . in particular",
    ", we most probably will not be able to reconstruct ww mass in the leptonic case ; although this channel will be a useful discovery channel to reveal the existence of kk gauge bosons .",
    "then , we will show that the semileptonic mode should be able to see both signals as they will be well separated due to the significant mass differences mentioned before .",
    "to summarize , our channels allow us to probe first rs kk graviton mode with mass below 3 - 3.5 tev and , also , to distinguish it from the contributions of rs spin-1 kk gauge bosons .",
    "certainly , the full establishment of the existence of spin-2 graviton from the rs model will need combined analysis of modes discussed in this paper with other decay modes considered before in the literature @xcite .",
    "the role of the @xmath31 mode is extremely important as this mode is forbidden for @xmath23 s to decay into .",
    "note , though , that the `` gold - plated '' nature of this special mode , with each z decaying to @xmath5 and @xmath6 , comes at the price of needing a higher luminosity  @xcite .",
    "thus , with the strategy discussed above and better statistics in ( semi)leptonic modes of w s , we may optimistically have evidence for the rs gravitons .",
    "we closely follow the model discussed in @xcite and briefly review it here . as discussed above , we allow sm fields to propagate in the extra dimension and distribute fermions along it to generate observed mass spectrum without introducing additional hierarchies .",
    "sm particles are identified with zero - modes of 5d fields , and the profile of the fermion in the extra dimension depends on its 5d mass . as was shown before @xcite , all fermion 5d masses are @xmath32(1 ) parameters with the biggest one , among the sm quarks , being that of the top quark . to specify the model even further ,",
    "the top quark is localized near the tev brane and the right - handed isospin is gauged @xcite .",
    "we consider @xmath33 being on the tev brane ( see discussion of the other possibilities in @xcite , for example ) . at the end of the day ,",
    "we are left with three parameters to be measured experimentally .",
    "we define them as @xmath34 the ratio of the ads curvature @xmath35 to the planck mass ; @xmath36 which monitors gauge kk masses with the first few being ( 2.45 , 5.57 , 8.7 ... )@xmath37 ; and finally , parameter @xmath38 , which defines where the lightest fermion with bulk mass @xmath39 is localized . for",
    "the @xmath33 on the tev brane , @xmath40 ; and the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 will remain free in our analysis .",
    "we now briefly review constraints placed on the warped extra - dimension model with custodial isospin symmetry @xcite , which we adopt in this paper .",
    "as it was shown in @xcite , kk mass scale as low as @xmath10 3 tev is allowed by precision electroweak data .",
    "regions of parameter space that successfully reproduce the fit to electroweak precision observables with kk excitations as light as @xmath10 3 tev were also studied in @xcite .",
    "implications of the observed b - mixings were discussed in @xcite . in the model of @xcite",
    "b - mixing is mainly accommodated by tree level exchange of kk gluons . in @xcite , the cp - violating effects on the @xmath43 system were shown to provide @xmath443.7 tev constraint at 68% cl .",
    "phenomenological constraints from lepton - flavor - violations were discussed in @xcite . in @xcite , `` anarchic '' randall - sundrum model of flavor was studied , and the minimal allowed kk scale of @xmath10 3 tev was found to be permitted for a few points in the natural rs parameter space ; but models with custodial isospin can relax these constraints . in @xcite , after extensive analysis of @xmath45 modes , only the @xmath46 decay was found to have sizable new physics effects . with negligible sm contributions ,",
    "current experimental bounds were translated into the lepton bulk mass parameters . for the first kk gauge boson mass of 2 - 4 tev , 10 - 20@xmath47 deviation from the sm results were found .",
    "top quark flavor violations and b - factory signals were also studied in @xcite .",
    "finally , in addition to the above mentioned constraints , since these frameworks contain beyond the sm operators with @xmath48 structure , they generate enhanced contributions to @xmath49 processes @xcite . without further flavor structure these contributions are expected to place a lower bound on the kk gluon mass of @xmath32(8 tev )  @xcite .",
    "actually , model building based on the underlying rs ideas continues to flourish , specially designed to find ways to lower the allowed kk - masses in face of the various experimental constraints .",
    "in fact , even a somewhat surprising claim that kk masses as low as 1 tev , consistent with all current experimental constraints , may be found in @xcite .",
    "an interesting variant of the warped extra dimension based on 5d minimal flavor violation was recently presented in @xcite .",
    "the model allows to eliminate current rs flavor and cp problem with a kk scale as low as 2 tev .",
    "finally , a volume - truncated version of the rs scenario called `` little randall - sundrum ( lrs ) '' model was constructed in @xcite .",
    "assuming separate gauge and flavor dynamics , a number of unwanted contributions to precision electroweak , @xmath50 , and flavor observables were shown to be suppressed in the lrs framework , compared with the corresponding rs case .",
    "bearing all this in mind , current theoretical constructions suggest that it would be difficult to have kk gauge bosons with masses below 3 tev ( which would imply @xmath51 4 tev ) ; if true then , as seen already in other studies  @xcite and will be shown here too , signals at the lhc for the rs idea would be extremely difficult to find .",
    "however , in light of the above discussion , it also seems fair to say that these models are still being developed ; and , therefore , it is not inconceivable that explicit construction(s ) will be found which will allow kk masses lower than 3 tev without running into conflict with electroweak precision experiments or with flavor physics .",
    "this point of view , in particular , was also emphasized in @xcite . thus in this paper",
    "we will take the view , for now , that it is best to search for experimental signatures with the widest latitude .      after these brief remarks we can write the couplings relevant to our discussions here . since the graviton couples to the energy - momentum tensor , all couplings have generic form @xmath52 ( `` 00n '' signifies that we are considering only coupling of the nth kk graviton to the sm fields which are zero - modes of the 5d fields ) .",
    "magnitude of the coupling constants depend on the overlap of the particle wavefunctions in the extra - dimension ( effects of the running gravitational coupling due to existence of non - gaussian fixed point were analyzed in @xcite ) .",
    "we present coefficients @xmath53 in table [ table ] along with partial decay widths for dominant decay channels for the lightest kk ( n=1 ) graviton which will be the focus of our analysis ; see also @xcite .",
    "the @xmath54 and hh decay channels illustrate equivalence theorem once again ( which is valid up to @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the graviton mass ) .",
    ".couplings of the nth level kk graviton to the sm fields .",
    "@xmath33 assumed to be localized on the tev brane .",
    "parameter @xmath57 is the mass of n=1 graviton and @xmath58 is the first root of the first order bessel function .",
    "@xmath59 is number of qcd colors . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this work , we have extended earlier studies of the discovery potential of warped gravitons at the lhc which concentrated on the gravitons decaying into the `` gold - plated '' zz channel and into the @xmath3 pair .",
    "we have considered resonant production of the first rs kk graviton mode via gluon - fusion process followed by its subsequent decay to @xmath7 pair .",
    "we focused on leptonic and semileptonic final states and found that with 300@xmath8 of data , lhc may discover first rs kk graviton with masses below @xmath10 3 tev and 3.5 tev in these modes respectively .",
    "we also incorporated potential kk @xmath23 signal in both modes and analyzed its combined effect with rs graviton . taking the rs prediction for the lightest kk masses , @xmath24",
    ", we showed that these signals are well separated in reconstructed ww invariant mass in the semileptonic mode .",
    "for the purely leptonic @xmath60 mode , where resonance mass reconstruction is problematic , the above mass relationship hints to the domination of the @xmath23 events as corresponding graviton mass will be higher .",
    "nevertheless , we demonstrated that even in that mode , appropriate choice of cuts in dilepton invariant mass may be able to distinguish these contributions as well .",
