    "in the classical model of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , an initially hot `` fireball '' is composed of photons , electron / positron pairs , and a small amount of baryons @xcite .",
    "this fireball is soon accelerated to a relativistic speed under its own thermal pressure . due to the existence of baryons , a significant fraction of energy",
    "is converted into the kinetic energy of the ejecta @xcite .",
    "the rest of energy is still stored in the form of photons , which escape the system as the fireball becomes transparent at the photosphere radius @xcite .",
    "the ejecta then coast with a relativistic speed without significant radiation until reaching a larger radius when a fraction of kinetic energy is dissipated into heat and radiation in internal shocks @xcite .",
    "the internal shock model has the advantage of interpreting grb variabilities , but suffers the low radiation efficiency problem @xcite .",
    "recently , an analysis of the prompt emission data of several grbs suggests that the internal shock model is disfavored by the data @xcite .",
    "an alternative model invokes a dynamically important magnetic field .",
    "within such a poynting flux dominated model , the observed grb emission is powered by dissipation of the magnetic energy within the ejecta @xcite .    until recently",
    ", it has been difficult to diagnose the grb composition from observational data .",
    "the recent detection of the broad - band featureless band - function spectra as well as the very high gamma - ray emission @xmath4 ) from grb 080916c by the fermi satellite @xcite provides a unique opportunity to diagnose the grb composition . below we will use the opacity argument (  2 ) and the photosphere argument (  3 ) to argue that the ejecta of grb 080916c must contain a significant fraction of energy that is initially not in the `` fireball '' form , but in a poynting flux entrained with baryonic matter .",
    "both the large area telescope ( lat ) and the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) on - board fermi have detected grb 080916c .",
    "the time - dependent spectral analysis reveals a series of featureless smoothly - joint broken power law (  band - function ",
    "* ) spectrum categorized by a peak energy @xmath5 and two asymptotic photon spectral power law indices @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "these spectra cover 5 - 6 orders of magnitude in energy , from @xmath8 kev to @xmath9 gev .",
    "the highest photon energy reaches 13.2 gev ( in the time interval `` d '' defined in fig.1 of @xcite ) . at a redshift @xmath10 @xcite",
    ", this burst is the most energetic grb known to date , with an isotropic gamma - ray energy @xmath11 erg .",
    "the gamma - ray spectrum is expected to have a pair cutoff feature at large energies due to the compactness argument , i.e. the optical depth for two photon pair production ( @xmath12 ) may reach unity above a critical cutoff energy @xmath13 . within the internal shock model , the pair cutoff energy ( or the lack of it ) , together with the observed variability time scale , can be used to constrain the bulk lorentz factor @xmath14 of the outflow @xcite . in some models , the observed variability time scale may not reflect that of the central engine @xcite .",
    "so more generally the pair cutoff energy can be expressed as a function of two independent parameters , the bulk lorentz factor @xmath14 and the gamma - ray emission radius @xmath1 from the central engine @xcite .",
    "for each cutoff energy @xmath13 , one can define a threshold energy @xmath15 above which the photons with this energy can interact with the photons at @xmath13 to produce pairs .",
    "this threshold condition is defined by @xmath16 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "the expression of the pair production optical depth @xmath17 depends on the relative location between @xmath15 and the band - function break energy . for @xmath18 ( which is generally satisfied for this analysis ) , the optical depth of a photon with the observed energy @xmath19",
    "can be coasted into a simple form ( derived from eqs.(13 ) and ( 14 ) of gupta & zhang 2008 , or from eqs .",
    "( 3 - 4 ) of lithwick & sari 2001 with @xmath20 absorbed into the expression of @xmath1 and with the cosmological correction factor @xmath21 properly taken into account ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the comoving distance of the grb , @xmath24 is the redshift of the grb , and @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the fundamental constants electron mass , speed of light , and thomson cross section , respectively . here",
    "the energies , i.e. @xmath19 and @xmath28 , are both in units of `` kev '' .",
    "the parameter @xmath29 ( in units of @xmath30 ) is such defined that the observed photon _ fluence _ spectrum above the break is written as @xmath31 . in terms of the fitting parameters of @xcite , @xmath29 can be expressed as @xmath32^{\\alpha-\\beta } \\exp(\\beta-\\alpha ) ( 100~{\\rm kev})^{-\\alpha}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the ( observed ) time interval taken to perform the band - function fit , and @xmath34 is the band - function normalization in units of @xmath35 . finally , the coefficient @xmath36 in eq.(1 ) is a function of @xmath7 , and we adopt the approximation @xmath37 @xcite to perform the calculations , while @xcite takes @xmath38 . for a typical value @xmath39 ,",
    "the @xmath36 value of @xcite and @xcite are consistent with each other , but that of @xcite is smaller by a factor of @xmath40 . ] .",
    "the lack of a spectral cutoff feature suggests @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the maximum energy of the observed photons . using this condition",
    ", one can derive the @xmath43 constraints for the 5 time intervals ( a - e ) defined by @xcite ( using the values in their table 1 , with @xmath33 defined by the time ranges listed in the table ) . by doing so , we have implicitly assumed that the emission location and lorentz factor for a particular time interval @xmath33 essentially remain the same .",
    "figure 1 shows the five critical lines ( solid ) in the @xmath43 space .",
    "the allowed parameter regimes are above the lines . for all the 5 time intervals",
    "the allowed emission radii are all large .",
    "this model - independent conclusion regarding a large @xmath1 is consistent with the results derived from other independent methods for other grbs @xcite .",
    "swift observations reveal a commonly seen steep - decay phase in the early x - ray afterglow @xcite , which suggests that the grb prompt emission region is separated from the emission region of the afterglow ( the external shock ) @xcite . within the `` internal '' models , the expected dissipation radius spans in a wide range , from the photosphere radius ( typically at @xmath44 cm ) to slightly smaller than the deceleration radius ( @xmath45 cm ) .",
    "the derived large emission radius @xmath1 is inconsistent with the photosphere model ( see  3 for detail ) , but is consistent with that expected from the magnetic dissipation model @xcite .",
    "the `` internal shock '' model invokes an emission radius @xmath46 ( where @xmath20 is the variability time scale of the central engine ) .",
    "the @xmath47 constraint of this model is plotted in figure [ figure:1 ] as black dashed lines for two values of the variability time scales discussed in @xcite , @xmath48  s. the internal shock site is allowed by the data .",
    "the constrained internal shock radii are at least @xmath49 cm for the five epochs .",
    "the required lorentz factors are at least 500 - 1000 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "however , there are further constrains on this model , as discussed below .",
    "besides the energy dissipation region ( internal shock or magnetic dissipation site ) , the fireball `` photosphere '' , at which the fireball becomes transparent during the expansion , is another emission site of grbs @xcite .",
    "the photosphere radius @xmath50 is defined by the electron scattering optical depth @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the electron number density and width of the ejecta shell in the rest frame comoving with the ejecta .",
    "below we will assume a pure baryonic flow ( as expected in the fireball model ) to derive the expected photosphere spectra .",
    "for a continuous baryonic wind ( which is suitable to describe grb 080916c given the smooth lightcurves reported in fig.1 of @xcite ) with a total wind luminosity @xmath54 , the photosphere radius can be written as @xcite @xmath55 for @xmath56 , and @xmath57 for @xmath58 . here , @xmath59 is the proton mass , @xmath60 is the dimensionless entropy of the baryonic flow , and @xmath61 is the radius at which the ejecta wind reaches the `` coasting '' phase .",
    "the critical dimensionless entropy is @xmath62 , and @xmath63 is the radius where the ejecta is emitted from the central engine .",
    "the coasting lorentz factor is @xmath64 for @xmath58 , and @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "the photosphere radii for the 5 epochs of grb 080916c are presented in fig.1 by the color dashed lines .",
    "it has been suggested that the observed @xmath5 of grbs may be the thermal peak of the photosphere emission @xcite , and that the comptonization of the thermal emission may lead to a non - thermal spectrum above @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however , for grb 080916c , figure 1 suggests that the observed gamma - ray emission is _ not _ from the photosphere , since @xmath67 . under the high - compactness condition",
    ", a second pair photosphere may be formed @xcite , but its radius is also much smaller than @xmath1 inferred from the data .",
    "another suggestion is that the observed grb spectra are the superposition of a thermal component ( photosphere ) that defines @xmath5 and a non - thermal power law component @xcite .",
    "this model is based on the data in a relatively narrow spectral range of _ batse _ , and when extrapolated to high energies , would violate the observed featureless band - function significantly .",
    "the theoretically expected thermal peak energy @xmath68  kev ( see below ) is well below the observed @xmath5 in the 5 epochs discussed by @xcite .",
    "clearly this model by itself is insufficient to interpret the data of this burst .",
    "the initial wind luminosity @xmath54 of the fireball is at least the observed gamma - ray luminosity @xmath69 ( assuming radiation efficiency 100% ) , i.e. @xmath70 .",
    "such an outflow , during the expansion , must have released a residual thermal emission at the transparent ( photosphere ) radius .",
    "the luminosity of this thermal component is high , and can be written as @xcite @xmath71 the expected temperature of the black body component emerging from the photosphere is thus @xmath72 for @xmath56 , and @xmath73 for @xmath58 , respectively , where @xmath74 is stefan - boltzmann s constant .    assuming a blackbody spectrum ( other modified spectral shapes would not change the conclusion ) , we plot in fig.2 the _ lower limit _ of the expected photosphere spectrum for the internal shock model in the baryon - dominated outflow ( by taking @xmath75 ) and",
    "compare it with the observations . for clarity ,",
    "only the prediction for the epoch ( b ) are plotted ( red thick - dashed curve ) .",
    "this plot corresponds to @xmath76 , hence @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79  kev .",
    "it is apparent that such a component strongly violates the observational data , which is a featureless band - function .",
    "one can further argue that the baryonic model in general does not work . in fig .",
    "2 , we present the predicted lower limits of the photosphere spectrum for two additional ( more conservative ) temperatures @xmath80  kev .",
    "these correspond to either a coasting lorentz factor @xmath81 ( for the same @xmath82 ) , or a central engine variability time scale much longer than what is observed ( for the same @xmath83 ) , which may be relevant to a fireball emerging from a stellar envelope in the collapsar model .",
    "these models give a much larger @xmath50 , and hence , a much lower @xmath84 .",
    "since @xmath85 s has been observed @xcite , the models that invoke a longer central engine variability time scale require the unconventional assumption that the observed variability time scale is not that of the central engine @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the predicted thermal spectra of these cases ( red , thin - dashed curves ) also strongly violate the observational constraints .",
    "this analysis strongly suggests that the initial wind luminosity was not stored in the `` fireball '' form at the base of the central engine .",
    "since there is no other known source of energy that can be entrained in the ejecta , we identify the missing luminosity as the poynting flux luminosity , which is not observable before strong magnetic dissipation occurs at a much larger radius .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that the photosphere thermal component can be much dimmer if the outflow is poynting flux dominated . in order to hide the bright thermal component",
    ", one can pose a lower limit on the ratio between the poynting flux and the baryonic flux , @xmath86 , .",
    "following @xcite , we define @xmath87 . assuming no dissipation of the poynting flux below @xmath50 , the above photosphere derivations can be modified by replacing @xmath54 by @xmath88 .",
    "one can then derive the required minimum @xmath89 value that can `` hide '' the photosphere thermal component .",
    "for the specific internal shock model required by the variability time scale ( the red thick - dashed curve ) , one requires at least @xmath90 at the photosphere to make the photosphere emission unobservable ( red thick - dotted curve in fig.2 ) . at such",
    "a high-@xmath89 shocks are very weak and can not power the bright gamma - ray emission @xcite , so unless @xmath89 can reduce significantly from the photosphere to the internal shock radius ( e.g. spruit et al .",
    "2001 ) but without generating a dominant emission component in the observed spectrum , the internal shock model is not a viable mechanism to interpret this burst . for the other two unconventional cases , similar minumim values of @xmath91 at photosphere are required in order to obtain consistency with the observed spectra .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the ejecta of grb 080916c can not be a pure `` fireball '' , but must store a significant fraction of energy initially in a poynting flux .",
    "in this _ letter _ , we show that the observed feature - less band - function broad band spectra of grb 080916c observed by the _ fermi _ satellite @xcite pose two interesting constraints on the grb prompt emission mechanism .",
    "first , the detection of high energy , @xmath92  gev , photons places a strong model - independent @xmath47 constraint on the grb ejecta ( fig.1 ) , which precludes the photosphere ( @xmath93 ) as the emission site .",
    "second , the non - detection of a bright thermal component expected from the baryonic models puts a strong constraint on the composition of the fireball : the flow should be dominated by a poynting flux component with a minimum @xmath94 at the photosphere in order to account for the observed spectra ( fig .",
    "2 ) , as long as the poynting flux energy is not directly converted to the kinetic energy of the flow below the photosphere .    within such a picture , the observed bright gamma - ray emission may be powered by dissipation of the poynting flux energy within the outflow .",
    "a poynting flux dominated flow favors synchrotron radiation as the emission mechanism of the observed gamma - rays .",
    "this is consistent with independent modeling of the burst @xcite .",
    "it also suggests a weak synchrotron self - compton component , which is not observed from the data .",
    "this model requires that the grb central engine launches a collimated magnetic bubble from the central engine ( black hole or millisecond magnetar ) , which propagates through the stellar envelope without reducing the @xmath89 value significantly @xcite . after escaping the star ,",
    "the ejecta is quickly accelerated under its own magnetic pressure @xcite . at the radius where photons become transparent ( photosphere ) ,",
    "the bulk of the wind energy is not in the thermal form .",
    "the @xmath89-value may reduce above photosphere .",
    "however , in order to have internal shocks , the magnetic energy needs to be `` quietly '' dissipated below the internal shock radius without significant emission .",
    "more naturally , the magnetic field may be globally dissipated in a cataclysmic manner to power the observed emission .",
    "this model does not demand a high @xmath89 at the deceleration radius , since @xmath89 of the flow would decrease significantly in the prompt emission region due to intense magnetic dissipation . in any case , the @xmath89 value at the deceleration radius can be of order unity or higher , which gives a weak or moderately bright reverse shock emission component @xcite .",
    "this analysis applies to grb 080916c .",
    "similar analyses can be carried out for more bursts co - detected by fermi lat / gbm in the future to determine whether other grb outflows are also magnetically dominated .",
