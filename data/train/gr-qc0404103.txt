    "in this chapter , quantum properties of the gravitational fields produced by quantized matter will be considered in the framework of the low - energy effective theory .",
    "this means that our interest will be in quantum aspects of the gravitational interaction at energy scales much lower than the planck energy @xmath4 from the practical point of view , this does not present a limitation , since all phenomena observed in the universe so far fall perfectly into this category . in view of the extreme smallness of the newton constant @xmath5",
    "these phenomena are well described by the lowest - order einstein theory . on the other hand ,",
    "the results obtained within the lowest - order approximation are model - independent , i.e. , they play the role of low - energy theorems .",
    "this universality allows one to draw a number of important conclusions concerning the synthesis of quantum theory and gravitation .",
    "an essential part of investigation of this synthesis consists in establishing a correspondence between classical and quantum theories",
    ". the formal rules of this correspondence are contained in the bohr correspondence principle which gives a general recipe for the construction of operators for various physical quantities .",
    "informally , the problem of correspondence is in elucidating actual conditions to be imposed on a system to allow its classical consideration .",
    "identification of these quasi - classical conditions constitutes an integral part of interpretative basis of quantum theory .",
    "right from this point of view the low - energy behavior in quantum gravity will be considered below .",
    "two characteristics of the gravitational field produced by a quantized system will be of our main concern in this chapter  the mean value of the gravitational field , and its correlation function .",
    "the results of independent investigation of these quantities will lead us to one and the same macroscopic formulation of the quasi - classical conditions in quantum gravity .    turning to a more detailed formulation of our approach ,",
    "let us note , first of all , that the low - energy condition stated above implies a similar condition on the characteristic length scale @xmath6 of the process under consideration , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the planck length @xmath9 in other words , our interest is in the _ long - range _ properties of the gravitational field produced by a given system .",
    "as far as this system can be treated classically , @xmath8 _ is _ the length scale characterizing quantum properties of its gravitational interactions , because @xmath10 is the only parameter entering the theory of quantized gravitational field through the einstein action @xmath11 in the presence of quantized matter , however , another parameter with dimension of length comes into play , namely the gravitational radius @xmath12 this parameter appears , of course , already in classical theory .",
    "the question of crucial importance is whether @xmath13 has an independent meaning in quantum domain , representing a scale of specifically quantum phenomena .",
    "this question may seem strange at first sight , as @xmath13 does not contain the planck constant @xmath14 an inalienable attribute of quantum theory .",
    "however , well known is the fact that gravitational radiative corrections do contain pieces independent of @xmath15 in the framework of the effective theory , they appear as a power series in @xmath16 just like post - newtonian corrections in classical general relativity .",
    "this fact was first clearly stated by iwasaki @xcite .",
    "the reason for the appearance of @xmath0 terms through the loop contributions is that in the case of gravitational interaction , the mass and `` kinetic '' terms in a matter lagrangian determine not only the properties of matter quanta propagation , but also their couplings .",
    "thus the mass term of , e.g. , scalar field lagrangian generates the vertices proportional to @xmath17 containing inverse powers of @xmath15 naively , one expects these be cancelled by @xmath18 s coming from the propagators when combining an amplitude .",
    "one should remember , however , that such a counting of powers of @xmath18 in feynman diagrams is a bad helpmate in the presence of massless particles .",
    "virtual propagation of gravitons interacting with matter field quanta near their mass shells results in a _ root _",
    "non - analyticity of the massive particle form factors at zero momentum transfer ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "for instance , the low - energy expansion of the one - loop diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) begins with terms proportional to @xmath20 rather than integer powers ( or logarithms ) of @xmath21 it is this singularity that is responsible for the appearance of powers of @xmath22 in the long - range expansion of the loop contributions . the question we ask is of what nature , classical or quantum , these pieces are .",
    "this is precisely the question of correspondence in quantum gravity .",
    "suppose that the matter producing gravitational field satisfies the usual quantum mechanical quasi - classical conditions , e.g. , consider sufficiently heavy particles .",
    "then the quasi - classical conditions for the gravitational field can be inferred from the requirement that the mean value of the spacetime metric , @xmath23 coincides with the classical solution of einstein equations , corresponding to the same distribution of gravitating matter .",
    "practically , the most convenient way of looking for these conditions is to compare _ transformation properties _ of the quantities involved under deformations of the reference frame , thus avoiding explicit calculation of the expectation values .",
    "the latter point of view takes advantage of the fact that the transformation law of classical solutions is known in advance .",
    "hence , we have to check whether @xmath24 transforms covariantly with respect to transitions between different reference frames . in other words",
    ", we have to consider the question of _ general covariance in quantum gravity .",
    "_ this is the way we follow in sec .",
    "[ transformegf ] .",
    "alternatively , one can infer the quasi - classical conditions from the requirement of _ vanishing of field fluctuations_. we take this rout in sec .",

    "also , right and left derivatives with respect to the fields and the sources , respectively , are used .",
    "the dimensional regularization of all divergent quantities is assumed .",
    "before going into detailed discussion of the question of general covariance in quantum gravity , let us describe the general setting we will be working in .",
    "first of all , we should set a frame of reference , _",
    "i.e. _ , a system of idealized reference bodies with respect to which the 4-position in spacetime can be fixed .",
    "let us assume , for definiteness , that the frame of reference is realized by means of an appropriate distribution of electrically charged matter . for simplicity",
    ", the energy - momentum of matter , as well as of the electromagnetic field it produces , will be assumed sufficiently small so as not to alter the gravitational field under consideration .",
    "the 4-position in spacetime can be determined by exchanging electromagnetic signals with a number of charged matter species .",
    "the electric charge distributions @xmath25 of the latter are thus supposed to be in a one - to - one correspondence with the spacetime coordinates @xmath26 @xmath27 where index @xmath28 enumerates the species .",
    "the @xmath29 will be assumed smooth scalar functions .",
    "physical properties of the reference frame are determined by the action @xmath30 which specific form is of no importance for us .",
    "next , let us consider a system of interacting gravitational and matter fields .",
    "the latter are arbitrary species , bosons or fermions , self - interacting or not , denoted collectively by @xmath31 @xmath32 dynamical variables of the gravitational field are @xmath33 dynamics of the system is described by the action @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the matter action , and @xmath36 is given @xmath37 the minkowski tensor @xmath38 is used to raise and lower tensor indices .",

    "( [ actionh ] ) .",
    "the central objects of our investigation in the sections below will be the expectation value of the gravitational field produced by an elementary particle , and its correlation function .",
    "they can be obtained from the one- and two - point green functions of the gravitational field , respectively , @xmath87}{\\delta t^{\\mu\\nu}}\\right|_{\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{j\\setminus j = 0}{k = 0}}\\ , , \\\\",

    "accordingly , diagrammatics generated upon expanding this integral in perturbation theory consists of the following elements .",
    "there are four types of pairings for each component of the set @xmath55 corresponding to the four different ways of placing two field operators on the two branches of the time path .",

    "the `` propagators '' @xmath111 @xmath112 satisfy the following matrix equations @xmath113 where @xmath114 denotes the free field part of the gauge - fixed action after the gauge introducing fields @xmath49 have been integrated out , and @xmath115 @xmath116 are @xmath117 matrices with respect to indices @xmath118 @xmath119 as in the ordinary feynman diagrammatics of the s - matrix theory , the propagators are contracted with the vertex factors generated by the interaction part of the action , @xmath120,$ ] with subsequent summation over @xmath121 in the vertices , each `` @xmath84 '' vertex coming with an extra factor @xmath122 this can be represented as the matrix multiplication of @xmath123 with suitable matrix vertices .",
    "for instance , the @xmath124 part of the action generates the matrix vertex @xmath125 which in components has the form @xmath126 where indices @xmath127 take the values @xmath128 and @xmath129 is defined by @xmath130 and zero otherwise .",
    "an external @xmath131 line is represented in this notation by a column @xmath132 satisfying @xmath133    for future references , we give explicit expressions for various pairings of a single real scalar field @xmath134",
    "in this section , we will investigate the structure of the @xmath0-order contributions to the effective gravitational field , concentrating mainly on their transformation properties under deformations of the reference frame .",
    "the appearance of such contributions through the radiative corrections has its roots in the field properties of quantized matter sources . to make the field - theoretic aspect of the problem clearer",
    ", it is convenient to get rid of the purely quantum mechanical issues related to the quantum particle kinematics assuming matter quanta sufficiently heavy to neglect the position - velocity indeterminacy following from the heisenberg principle .",
    "this assumption justifies the use of the term `` particle at rest , '' and allows one to introduce a fixed distance @xmath153 between the particle and the point of observation .",
    "the mean gravitational field produced by a massive particle is a function of five dimensional parameters  the fundamental constants @xmath154 the particle s mass @xmath155 and the distance @xmath156 of these only two independent dimensionless combinations can be constructed , which we choose to be @xmath157 and @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the compton length of the particle .",
    "the above assumption means that the gravitational field is considered in the limit @xmath160 for a fixed particle s mass , small values of @xmath161 imply large values of @xmath71 leading naturally to the long - range expansion of the mean gravitational field .",
    "accordingly , we will use where appropriate the terminology and general ideas of effective field theories @xcite .      from the point of view of the general formalism outlined in the preceding sections",
    ", the classical einstein theory corresponds to the tree approximation of the full quantum theory .",
    "the tree contributions to the expectation values of field operators coincide with the corresponding classical fields , and the effective equations of motion @xmath162 expressing the translation invariance of the functional integral measure , go over into the classical einstein equations .",
    "some of the tree diagrams representing their solution are shown in fig .",
    "the results of the preceding section allow one , in particular , to reestablish the general covariance of these equations .",
    "as was mentioned in the introduction , coordinate transformations are replaced in the quantum theory by the field transformations . in particular , transformations of the reference frame are represented by variations of the fields @xmath163 induced by appropriate variations of the gauge conditions .",

    "this means that the structure of reference frames in classical theory is determined by the functions @xmath47 only .",

    "[ fig2](a ) in which the internal wavy lines correspond to the virtual photons . however , as we have shown , it is meaningless to try to establish the correspondence between classical and quantum theories in terms of _ elementary _ particles , because quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic and gravitational fields produced by such particles are of the order of the fields themselves . on the other hand , because of its inappropriate dependence on the number of particles , the diagram [ fig2](a ) fails to reproduce the classical physics in the macroscopic limit .",
    "this can be shown using the same argument as in the case of purely gravitational interaction .",
