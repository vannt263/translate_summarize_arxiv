    "quantum phase transitions in disordered electronic systems remain one of the central problems in condensed - matter physics .",
    "considerable attention has recently focused on both the energy levels and the critical eigenfunctions , which strongly fluctuate near the critical point and thus have multifractal scaling properties @xcite .",

    "a complete knowledge of @xmath17 is equivalent to a complete physical characterization of the fractal @xcite .    among all the fractal dimensions ,",
    "the correlation dimension @xmath1 of the eigenfunctions plays the most prominent role , since it has been related to the level compressibility @xcite , the spatial dispersion of the diffusion coefficient @xcite and the anomalous spreading of a wave - packet at the mobility edge @xcite .",
    "multifractality is also related to the probability overlap of eigenstates with energy separation much greater than the average separation level . in particular",
    ", @xmath1 describes these density correlations .",
    "it has been shown that for multifractal eigenstates these correlations decay slowly no matter how sparse those states are @xcite .",
    "short - range correlations in the energy levels , which are closely related to the localization properties of the corresponding wave - functions @xcite , can be described by the critical distribution @xmath3 of the normalized spacings @xmath19 .",
    "the large @xmath19 asymptotic behavior of this distribution is still an open question and the subject of discussion @xcite .",
    "metal - insulator transitions ( mit s ) depend on the dimensionality and symmetries of the system and can occur in both the strong disorder and the weak disorder regime ( strong - coupling or weak - coupling regime , respectively , of the corresponding field - theoretical description ) as well as in the intermediate regime .",
    "each regime is characterized by its respective coupling strength @xcite .",
    "the disorder - induced mit is usually investigated for hamiltonians with short - range , off - diagonal matrix elements ( e.g. , the canonical anderson model ) .",
    "other hamiltonians exhibiting an mit in arbitrary dimension @xmath0 are those that include long - range hopping terms @xcite .",
    "the effect of long - range hopping on localization was originally considered by anderson @xcite for randomly distributed impurities in @xmath0 dimensions with the @xmath20 hopping interaction .",
    "it is known @xcite that all states are extended for @xmath21 , whereas for @xmath22 the states are localized .",

    ", a real - space renormalization group can be constructed for the distribution of couplings @xcite .",
    "these models are the most convenient for studying critical properties numerically since the exact quantum critical point is known ( @xmath24 ) and , in addition , they allow the low - dimensional cases to be treated , thus using larger system sizes and reducing the numerical effort .",
    "although a great progress in understanding critical properties of the @xmath25 long - range random hopping hamiltonian has recently been made @xcite explicit results for the @xmath26 and @xmath27 systems are still lacking .",
    "our aim was to investigate the two previously mentioned important quantities , the correlation dimension and nearest level spacing distribution , at the mit , which have been left unexplored .",

    "the corresponding hamiltonian , which describes non - interacting electrons on a disordered @xmath0-dimensional square lattice with random long - range hopping , is represented by real symmetric matrices , whose entries are randomly drawn from a normal distribution with zero mean , @xmath28 , and a variance which depends on the distance between the lattice sites @xmath29 @xmath30    using field theoretical methods @xcite , the prbm model was shown to undergo a sharp transition at @xmath24 from localized states for @xmath31 to delocalized states for @xmath21 .",
    "this transition shows all the key features of the anderson mit , such as multifractality of the eigenfunctions and non - trivial spectral compressibility at criticality . in",

    "furthermore , it determines the critical dimensionless conductance in the same way as the dimensionality labels the different anderson transitions .",
    "each regime is characterized by its respective coupling strength , which depends on the ratio @xmath34 between diagonal disorder and the off - diagonal transition matrix elements of the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "many real systems of interest can be described by hamiltonians ( [ h1dor ] ) . among such systems",
    "are optical phonons in disordered dielectric materials coupled by electric dipole forces @xcite , excitations in two - level systems in glasses interacting via elastic strain @xcite , magnetic impurities in metals coupled by an @xmath35 ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yodida interaction @xcite , and impurity quasiparticle states in two - dimensional disordered @xmath0-wave superconductors @xcite .",

    "in this section we investigate critical fluctuations in the eigenfunctions of the two - dimensional model ( [ h1dor ] ) in terms of multifractal measures , focusing on the correlation dimension @xmath1 . at the mit , where the natural length scale ( the localization length ) diverges , strong fluctuations in the wave - functions @xmath57",
