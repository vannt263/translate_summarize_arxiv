    "magnetic reconnection occurs in plasmas where oppositely directed magnetic fields merge , effectively break and transfer their magnetic energy into kinetic energy and heat .",
    "this process occurs between the interplanetary magnetic field ( imf ) and the terrestrial magnetic field at the dayside magnetopause , transferring solar wind plasma into near - earth space ; this is the first step in the dungey cycle of magnetospheric convection  @xcite .",
    "however , predicting where magnetic reconnection occurs at earth s dayside magnetopause for arbitrary solar wind conditions has been the subject of studies for nearly fifty years and remains a challenging problem .",
    "knowledge of where reconnection occurs at earth s magnetopause is crucial for developing a quantitative prediction of geomagnetic activity for space weather applications and to support satellite missions studying magnetic reconnection , such as nasa s upcoming magnetospheric multiscale ( mms ) mission  @xcite .    in the classical sketches of  @xcite",
    ", reconnection occurs at the subsolar point for due southward imf and near the polar cusps for due northward imf orientations ( ignoring earth s dipole tilt ) .",
    "however , much less is known about where reconnection occurs when the imf makes an arbitrary clock angle @xmath0 with the earth s dipole axis .",
    "the location of dayside magnetic reconnection was originally discussed in terms of anti - parallel  @xcite or component reconnection , either with a uniform out - of - plane ( guide ) magnetic field  @xcite or equal and opposite components of the reconnecting magnetic field  @xcite ) ; the latter is known to not be valid .",
    "a number of literature reviews have been written on this subject  @xcite ; the upshot is that both component and anti - parallel reconnection have been seen in observations and simulations .",
    "this implies that neither model can explain all the data so models going beyond them are necessary .",
    "some recent models suggest that reconnection occurs where some parameter is maximized which produces reconnection at an optimum efficiency .",
    "one such model is the maximum magnetic shear model  @xcite , an extension of the anti - parallel reconnection hypothesis .",
    "this model suggests that reconnection occurs where the magnetic shear angle between the magnetospheric and magnetosheath magnetic fields is a maximum .",
    "three related models suggest reconnection occurs where the reconnection outflow speed is maximized  @xcite , the reconnection rate is maximized  ( shay , private communication , 2009 ;  @xcite ) , and the reconnecting field s magnetic energy is maximized  @xcite .",
    "other models suggest that reconnection occurs where the current density is a maximum  @xcite or where the magnetospheric magnetic field and the draped imf are bisected  @xcite .",
    "there are a number of studies testing some of these models in different contexts .",
    "the maximum magnetic shear model was shown to be consistent with observations of magnetic reconnection at planetary magnetopauses with data from cluster  @xcite , themis  @xcite , and cassini  @xcite .",
    "also , observations  @xcite and simulations  @xcite suggest that the maximization of the asymmetric reconnection outflow speed controls the location and orientation of reconnection , although it is difficult to distinguish maximum outflow speed from maximum reconnection rate .",
    "the angle of bisection hypothesis has been tested with observations and in global magnetospheric simulations  @xcite and in two - dimensional ( 2d ) reconnection simulations  @xcite .",
    "one reason the location of reconnection at the dayside magnetopause is difficult to predict is that reconnection does not occur at a single point , but rather occurs along a line of finite extent .",
    "magnetopause reconnection occurs along the line that separates magnetic fields of different topologies - solar wind and closed magnetospheric field lines merge and reconnect , resulting in open field lines .",
    "this line is called the magnetic separator  @xcite , and is the three - dimensional ( 3d ) analog of the 2d x - line .",
    "there is observational  @xcite and numerical  @xcite evidence for the existence of separators throughout earth s magnetosphere .",
    "consequently , a careful assessment of the correctness of the recent models for the location and orientation of reconnection begins with a comparison of their predictions to the measured magnetic separators . to do so",
    ", we interpret the models , as  @xcite has done with the maximum magnetic shear model , as predicting the collections of points that locally maximize a particular quantity rather than the single point that globally maximizes the quantity in question .",
    "the goal of this study is to systematically test the recent models against the separators arising in self - consistent global simulations of the magnetosphere .",
    "to do so , we employ image processing techniques to unambiguously determine each model s prediction in our simulations .",
    "each model s prediction is then compared with the magnetic separator determined with the algorithm described in  @xcite ; this algorithm has been shown to work for imf with an arbitrary orientation .",
    "the present study tests each model s agreement with the separators for various imf clock angle @xmath0 , imf strength @xmath1 , and dipole tilt angle . we also present a test of one possible way to incorporate the effects of a flow shear parallel to the reconnecting fields into the models based on reconnection outflow speed and reconnection rate .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows : section  [ section::reconnection_location_models ] reviews the models of dayside reconnection location that we test in the present study .",
    "section  [ section::methodology ] describes our methodology : the method used to determine the magnetopause , a robust image processing algorithm to determine each model s prediction , and details of our global magnetospheric simulations .",
    "our results are presented in section  [ section::results ] .",
    "a summary of our results and applications are discussed in section  [ section::conclusions ] .",

    "this section reviews the models tested in this study .",
    "we employ the boundary normal ( lmn ) coordinate system .",
    "the @xmath6 direction is the magnetopause normal corresponding to the inflow direction , the @xmath7 direction corresponds to the reconnecting component of the magnetic field , and the @xmath5 direction gives the direction of the out - of - plane ( guide ) magnetic field , completing the right - handed triplet .",

    "the angle @xmath4 is the angle @xmath8 makes with the @xmath5 axis and is constrained to occur within the range @xmath9 .",

    ", reconnection occurs at magnetopause locations where the magnetic shear angle @xmath2 between the magnetospheric and magnetosheath magnetic fields is a maximum .",

    "the magnetic shear angle @xmath2 is calculated from the magnetospheric and magnetosheath magnetic fields as @xmath10 alternative explanations have suggested that reconnection occurs at locations where some measure of reconnection efficiency is maximized . in the model of  @xcite ,",

    "reconnection orients so as to maximize the reconnection electric field @xmath12  ( shay , private communication , 2009 ) ,  @xcite ) . to calculate the predictions from these models at the dayside magnetopause",
    ", one needs the plasma parameters of the magnetosheath and magnetosphere , where asymmetries in the magnetic field and plasma density strongly affect reconnection .",

    ", we interpret these as saying that the local @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be found at every location on the magnetopause by finding @xmath4 at every location , and that reconnection occurs where the parameter is a local maximum .",
    "we note in passing that this approach assumes that any nonzero @xmath23 component of either magnetic field does not affect the outflow speed or reconnection rate .",
    "this is not likely to be correct in the real magnetosphere where finite larmor radius effects are important , but should be accurate for the mhd simulations in the present study .",
    "another limitation of the present formulation of these arguments is that they neglect the importance of the plasma bulk flow parallel to the reconnecting magnetic field components ; we detail an attempt to account for this effect and measure the impact on the predictions of the asymmetric reconnection models in section  [ subsection::shear_flow ] .",
    "more recently ,  @xcite suggested that the reconnection rate is proportional to the product of the reconnecting component s magnetic energies , @xmath24 and reconnection maximizes this product . applying a maximization argument with respect to @xmath4",
    "gives a solution of @xmath25 ; this is equivalent to previous arguments where the guide field bisects the merging magnetosheath and magnetospheric magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "we also test the model that predicts reconnection to occur where the current density magnitude @xmath26 is a maximum  @xcite .",
    "a related approach has been to look at the divergence of the poynting vector .",
    "reconnection has been located by measuring this quantity in observations  @xcite and simulations  @xcite . in steady - state ,",
    "the divergence of the poynting vector is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the electric field given by ohm s law .",
    "the present study employs a large explicit resistivity , to be described in section  [ subsection::simulation_study ] . in this system",
    ", the divergence of the poynting vector simplifies to @xmath29 at the reconnection site .",
    "we therefore argue that , up to a scaling factor , the poynting vector s divergence would give similar results as the maximum current density magnitude argument for this study .    for completeness",
    ", we also test the component reconnection hypothesis as originally proposed by  @xcite and  @xcite , even though observations  @xcite and simulations  @xcite suggest the model is not valid . in this model ,",
    "the local reconnection geometry orients itself such that the @xmath5 component of the magnetic field is uniform , which , using the notation in fig .",
    "[ fig::lmn_coordinates ] , implies @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "this model places an additional constraint on the orientation angle @xmath4 , with valid solutions only when the magnetic shear angle @xmath2 is greater than the critical shear angle @xmath32 .",
    "each of the models discussed in the previous section suggest reconnection at the dayside magnetopause occurs where some parameter is a local maximum .",
    "we model our approach after  @xcite , who identified a curve corresponding to where the magnetic shear angle @xmath2 was a local maximum at the magnetopause .",
    "the magnetospheric magnetic field was modeled using the t96 model  @xcite and the cooling model is used for the draped magnetosheath magnetic field  @xcite to calculate @xmath2 at many locations on the dayside magnetopause .",
    "the local shear angle @xmath2 was plotted as a function of the magnetopause s @xmath33 and @xmath34 coordinates ( it was projected into the @xmath35 plane ) and maxima in this shear angle map were determined by finding maxima along cuts parallel to the imf  ( k. trattner , private communication , 2013 ) .",
    "the following sections detail how we robustly identify the magnetopause and calculate model predictions in our global magnetospheric simulations .      to identify the magnetopause in our global magnetospheric simulations , we modify the method of  @xcite .",

    "the location of maximum current density magnitude at smallest @xmath39 is identified as the magnetopause and this location s coordinates @xmath40 are saved ; the chosen sampling range excludes the ring current , but we take additional care by ensuring each point has a radial distance within 2  @xmath38 of the previous point s radial distance .",
    "we employ spherical coordinates in the geocentric solar magnetospheric ( gsm ) system , where the azimuthal angle @xmath41 is measured from the @xmath42 axis and the polar angle @xmath2 is measured from the @xmath43 axis ; we discretize both into 5@xmath44 increments .",

    "one may perform a minimum variance analysis ( mva ) on the magnetic field  @xcite to determine the magnetopause normal .",

    "one consequence of asymmetric reconnection systems is that the stagnation point separates from the reconnection x - line in 2d reconnection  @xcite ; the maximum of the out - of - plane current density also separates from the x - line .",

    "<S> we test and compare a number of existing models predicting the location of magnetic reconnection at earth s dayside magnetopause for various solar wind conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we employ robust image processing techniques to determine the locations where each model predicts reconnection to occur . </S>",
    "<S> the predictions are then compared to the magnetic separators , the magnetic field lines separating different magnetic topologies . </S>",
    "<S> the predictions are tested in distinct high - resolution simulations with interplanetary magnetic field ( imf ) clock angles ranging from 30 to 165 degrees in global magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the three - dimensional block - adaptive tree solarwind roe - type upwind scheme ( bats - r - us ) code with a uniform resistivity , although the described techniques can be generally applied to any self - consistent magnetosphere code . </S>",
    "<S> additional simulations are carried out to test location model dependence on imf strength and dipole tilt . </S>",
    "<S> we find that most of the models match large portions of the magnetic separators when the imf has a southward component , with the models saying reconnection occurs where the local reconnection rate and reconnection outflow speed are maximized performing best . </S>",
    "<S> when the imf has a northward component , none of the models tested faithfully map the entire magnetic separator , but the maximum magnetic shear model is the best at mapping the separator in the cusp region where reconnection has been observed . </S>",
    "<S> predictions for some models with northward imf orientations improve after accounting for plasma flow shear parallel to the reconnecting components of the magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> implications for observations are discussed .    </S>",
