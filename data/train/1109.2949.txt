    "studies of giant planets interaction with a protoplanetary gas disk show that their orbits radially migrate , and typically achieve a compact configuration , in which pairs of the neighbor planets are locked in the mean motion resonances ( kley 2000 , masset & snellgrove 2001 ) .",
    "the resonant planetary systems emerging from protoplanetary disks can become dynamically unstable after the gas disappears , leading to a phase when planets scatter off of each other .",
    "this model can explain the observed resonant exoplanets , commonly large exoplanet eccentricities ( weidenschilling & marzari 1996 ) , and microlensing data that show evidence for a large number of planets that are free - floating in interstellar space ( sumi et al . 2011 ) .",
    "the solar system , with the widely spaced and nearly circular orbits of the giant planets , bears little resemblance to the bulk of known exoplanets . yet , if our understanding of physics of planet ",
    "gas - disk interaction is correct , it seems likely that the young solar system followed the evolutionary path outlined above . due to the convergent planetary migration in times before the gas disk s dispersal",
    ", each planet should have become trapped in a resonance with its neighbor .",
    "jupiter and saturn , for example , were most likely trapped in the 3:2 resonance ( masset & snellgrove 2001 , morbidelli & crida 2007 , pierens & nelson 2008 ) , defined as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the orbital periods of jupiter and saturn ( this ratio is 2.49 today ) .    to stretch to the present , more relaxed state",
    ", the outer solar system most likely underwent a violent phase when planets scattered off of each other and acquired eccentric orbits ( thommes et al .",
    "1999 , tsiganis et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the system was subsequently stabilized by damping the excess orbital energy into the transplanetary disk , whose remains survived to this time in the kuiper belt . finally , as evidenced by dynamical structures observed in the present kuiper belt , planets radially migrated to their current orbits by scattering planetesimals ( malhotra et al .",
    "1995 , levison et al .",
    "we conducted computer simulations of the early evolution of the solar system in an attempt to determine the initial states of planetary orbits ( batygin & brown 2010 ) .",
    "first , we performed hydrodynamic and @xmath1-body simulations to identify the resonant configurations that may have occurred among the young solar system s giant planets .",
    "our hydrodynamic simulations used fargo ( masset 2000 ) and followed the method described in morbidelli et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . as the fargo simulations are cpu expensive , we used these results as a guide , and generated many additional resonant systems with the @xmath1-body integrator known as symba ( duncan et al .",
    "1998 ) .    planets with masses corresponding to those of jupiter , saturn and ice giants were placed in initial orbits with the period ratios slightly larger that those of the selected resonances .",
    "the planets were then migrated into resonances with the symba code that was modified to include forces that mimic the effects of gas .",
    "we considered cases with four and five initial planets , where in the later case , an additional planet was placed into a resonant orbit between saturn and the ice giants , or beyond the orbit of the outer ice giant .",
    "the fifth planet was given the mass between @xmath5 and @xmath6 g , which roughly corresponds to 1/3 and 3 times the mass of uranus ( or neptune ) .",
    "different starting positions of planets , rates of the semimajor axis and eccentricity evolution , and timescales for the gas disk s dispersal produced different results . for jupiter and saturn , we confined the scope of this study to the 3:2 and 2:1 resonances , because the former one is strongly preferred from previous hydrodynamic studies ( masset & snellgrove 2001 , morbidelli et al .",
    "2007 , pierens & nelson 2008 ) .",
    "the 2:1 resonance was included for comparison . the eccentricities and resonant amplitudes obtained here",
    "were typically @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the inner ice giant had @xmath9 in most cases , while the other planets acquired more circular orbits .",
    "the instability of a planetary system can occur after the gas disk s dispersal when the stabilizing effects of gas are removed .",
    "such an instability can be triggered spontaneously ( e.g. , weidenschilling & marzari 1996 ) , or by divergent migration of planets produced by their interaction with planetesimals leaking into the planet - crossing orbits from the transplanetary disk ( thommes et al . 1999 ) . in the later case ,",
    "the instability is produced when jupiter and saturn cross a major mean motion resonance ( tsiganis et al .",
    "2005 ; also known as the _ nice model _ ) .    in the solar system",
    ", it is often assumed that the instability occurred at the time of the late heavy bombardment ( lhb ) of the moon some 3.9 gy ago , when the lunar basins with known ages formed ( hartmann et al . 2000 ) .",
    "if so , the solar system s giant planets would be required to remain on their initial resonant orbits for about 700 myr . to allow for this possibility , we sifted through the resonant configurations identified above and selected those that were stable over @xmath10 yr , if considered in isolation .",
    "only the stable systems were used for the follow - up simulations , in which we tracked the evolution of planetary orbits through and past the instability .",
    "we included the effects of the transplanetary planetesimal disk in these simulations .",
    "the disk was represented by 1000 equal - mass bodies that were placed into orbits with low orbital eccentricities and inclinations , and in radial distances between @xmath11 .",
    "the surface density was set to be @xmath12 .",
    "the outer edge of the disk was placed at @xmath13 au , so that the planetesimal - driven migration is expected to park neptune near its present semimajor axis .",
    "we considered cases with @xmath14 , 1 , and 3.5 au .",
    "the instability was triggered early for @xmath14 au , as planetesimals leaked from the inner part of the disk into the planetary region , and interacted with planets . to trigger the instability for @xmath15 and 3.5 au , we broke the resonant locks by altering the mean anomaly of one of the ice giants .",
    "this method was inspired by the recent study of the late instability that showed that planets can slowly exchange orbital energy with a distant planetesimal disk , and break from the resonances when the resonant amplitude exceeds certain limits ( levison et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "in either case discussed above , the scattering phase between planets starts shortly after the beginning of our simulations , which guarantees low cpu cost .",
    "we considered four different masses of the planetesimal disk , @xmath16 , 20 , 35 , 50 , 75 and 100 @xmath17 , and performed 30 simulations in each case , where different evolution histories were generated by randomly seeding the initial orbit distribution of planetesimals . in total",
    ", we completed over 6000 scattering simulations .",
    "each system was followed for 100 myr , at which point the planetesimal disk was largely depleted and planetary migration ceased .",
    "we defined several criteria to measure the overall success of simulations .",
    "first of all , the final planetary system must have four giant planets ( criterion a ) with orbits that resemble the present ones ( criterion b ) .",
    "note that a means that one planet must be ejected in the five - planet runs , while all four planets need to survive in the four - planet runs . as for b",
    ", we claim success if the final mean semimajor axis of each planet is within 20% to its present value , and if the final mean eccentricities and mean inclinations are no larger than 0.11 and 2@xmath18 , respectively .",
    "these thresholds were obtained by doubling the current mean eccentricity of saturn ( @xmath19 ) and mean inclination of uranus ( @xmath20 ) .    for the successful runs ,",
    "as defined above , we also checked on the history of encounters between giant planets , evolution of the secular @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 modes , and secular structure of the final planetary systems . to explain the observed populations of the irregular moons that are roughly similar at each planet ( jewitt & haghighipour 2007 ) , all planets including jupiter must participate in encounters ( nesvorn et al .",
    "encounters of jupiter and/or saturn with ice giants may also be needed to excite the @xmath21 mode in the jupiter s orbit to its current amplitude ( @xmath24 ; morbidelli et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "it turns out that it is generally easy to have encounters of one of the ice giants to jupiter if planets start in a compact resonant configuration .",
    "the amplitudes of @xmath22 and @xmath23 modes also do not pose a problem .",
    "it is much harder to excite @xmath25 , however .",
    "we therefore opt for a criterion in which we require that @xmath26 in the final systems , i.e. , at least half of its current value ( criterion c ) .",
    "the @xmath25 amplitude was determined by following the final planetary systems for additional 10 myr ( without planetesimals ) , and fourier - analyzing the results ( idlichovsk & nesvorn 1996 ) .",
    "the evolution of secular modes , mainly @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , is constrained from their effects on the terrestrial planets and asteroid belt . as outer planets scatter and migrate ,",
    "these frequencies change .",
    "this may become a problem , if @xmath21 slowly swipes over the @xmath27 or @xmath28 modes , because the strong @xmath29 and @xmath30 resonances can produce excessive excitation and instabilities in the terrestrial planet system ( brasser et al .",
    "2009 , agnor & lin 2011 ) .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 modes , on the other hand , is important for the asteroid belt ( morbidelli et al .",
    "2010 ) .    as @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23",
    "are mainly a function of the orbital separation between jupiter and saturn , the constraints from the terrestrial planets and asteroid belt can be conveniently defined in terms of @xmath31 .",
    "this ratio needs to evolve from @xmath322.1 to @xmath332.3 in @xmath34 myr ( criterion d ) , which can be achieved , for example , if planetary encounters with an ice giant scatter jupiter inward and saturn outward .",
    "this condition may therefore require planetary encounters , but is more subtle in that not all simulations with jupiter encounters are good .",
    "we start by discussing the results obtained with four planets that were assumed to be initially locked in the ( 3:2,3:2,4:3 ) resonances .",
    "the inner ice giant has the largest eccentricity ( @xmath35 ) . according to levison et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , the system should therefore be driven toward the instability by the energy and momentum exchange between the inner ice giant and planetesimal disk .",
    "we set @xmath36  au , so that the inner disk edge is well beyond the orbits of the two ice giants ( @xmath37au and @xmath38 au ) .",
    "this setup should be consistent with the late instability ( levison et al . 2011 ) .",
    "the best results were obtained with @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the fraction of simulations producing the final systems with four outer planets is 10% and 13% , respectively ( criterion a ) .",
    "only three of the total of 120 integrations performed for these disk masses satisfied our criterion b. this shows that it is very unlikely that the solar system evolved from these initial states .",
    "the results do not improve when @xmath41 is varied . the light disks with @xmath42 lead to final systems with fewer than 4 planets .",
    "the heavy disks with @xmath43 do not work as well , as we discuss in more detail below (  4.2 ) .",
    "we compare these results with those obtained for the five - planet systems . to start with",
    ", the five planets were placed into the ( 3:2,3:2,4:3,5:4 ) resonances and fifth planet was given the mass equal to that of uranus .",
    "as in the four - planet case , we fix @xmath36  au so that the most eccentric inner ice giant ( @xmath44 ) has about the same radial distance from the inner edge of the disk .",
    "the best five - planet results were obtained for @xmath40 with the fraction of systems matching criteria a and b raising to 37% and 23% , respectively ( fig . [ orb ] ) .",
    "this shows that it is it roughly ten times more likely to obtain a good solar system analog starting from five planets than from four planets , at least in the case discussed above .",
    "this result is not unexpected because systems starting from a compact resonant configuration typically suffer a rather violent instability , and tend to loose planets ( fig .",
    "[ mig ] ) .",
    "the results for the four - planet case do not improve when the mass of the planetesimal disk is increased . with @xmath45 ,",
    "neptune migrates too far and/or the divergent migration of jupiter and saturn moves these planets too far apart so that @xmath46 in the end .",
    "the former problem can be resolved if the disk were truncated at @xmath4725 au , but we do not see any obvious cure to the second problem .",
    "this is because the final radial spacing of the jupiter s and saturn s orbits depends on the mass of material processed through @xmath3210 au , which is simply too large for @xmath45 .",
    "in addition , saturn and jupiter tend to end up on unrealistically circular orbits for large @xmath41 , because their eccentricities are damped by the large mass that these planets interact with .",
    "the success rate of simulations depends on @xmath48 with the larger @xmath48 values leading to a lower success rate .",
    "for example , the best four - planet case discussed above matched the criterion b in 10% of cases for @xmath49 au and @xmath40 , which is only slightly lower that the success rate obtained for the five - planet case with @xmath50 au and @xmath40 . on the other hand",
    ", the success rate of the four - planet case drops to @xmath513% if @xmath50 au .",
    "the sensitivity of the success rate to @xmath48 stems from the following . with the small @xmath48 values",
    ", planetesimals can rapidly leak from the inner part of the transplanetary disk into the planetary region , and stabilize planets very soon after the onset of the instability . with large @xmath48",
    ", on the other hand , the system lacks the stabilizing effect of planetesimals on planet - crossing orbits , planetary orbits become increasingly excited , and planets can be ejected .",
    "this highlights the importance of planet - crossing population of planetesimals on the results .",
    "we tested cases with different masses of the fifth planet . following the mass gradient",
    ", we placed the fifth planet with the mass intermediate between those of saturn and uranus into an exterior resonance with saturn , or a planet with mass lower than that of neptune beyond the orbit of neptune .",
    "the former case did not lead to any improvement of the results discussed above , because the system became to violent and frequently ejected the less massive planets from the system . in the later case",
    ", the statistics also did not improve because the inner ice giant got ejected , thus leaving a final system with incorrect masses .",
    "we found that the behavior of planetary systems , and whether or not the final systems end up resembling the outer solar system , do not depend in detail on the initial resonant sequence between saturn and ice giants . instead , the results are mainly sensitive to the initial resonance between jupiter and saturn , with 3:2 or 2:1 cases considered here , and the overall initial spread of the ice giants orbits .",
    "as for the 3:2 jupiter - saturn resonance , the case with ( 3:2,3:2,4:3,5:4 ) discussed above was one of the most compact resonant systems studied here .",
    "other compact systems show similar success rates .",
    "the most relaxed system studied here was ( 3:2,3:2,3:2,3:2)@xmath52(3:2)@xmath53 . with @xmath50",
    "au ( @xmath54 au in this case ) and @xmath39 , the success rate was higher than the one obtained for a similar setup with ( 3:2,3:2,4:3,5:4 ) .",
    "for example , the criterion a was satisfied in 33% of simulations with ( 3:2)@xmath53 , while it was 13% in the former case , and criterion b was satisfied in 17% of simulations .",
    "this shows that a more relaxed initial resonant configuration of ice giants can improve the statistics ( mainly for the lower mass disks ; @xmath55 ) .",
    "the four - planet case with the 2:1 jupiter - saturn resonance shows a relatively large success rate in matching our criteria a and b. the instability produced in these simulations tends to be weaker than in the 3:2 case , which seems to have positive impact on the results .",
    "there are fewer cases of jupiter encounters with one of the ice giants , however , leading to orbit histories that violate constraints c and d. we did not found any case , for ( 2:1,3:2,3:2 ) and @xmath56 , where these criteria would be satisfied .",
    "the five - planet case with the 2:1 jupiter - saturn resonance is interesting .",
    "better results were obtained in this case when the inner ice giant had lower mass , because when jupiter and saturn start in the 2:1 resonance , their period ratio needs to change by @xmath00.5 only ( from 2 to 2.49 ) , which requires a smaller perturbation .",
    "assuming a planet half the uranus mass , @xmath57 and @xmath58 au , where @xmath59 denotes the semimajor axis of the outer ice giant , criterion a was satisfied in @xmath050% of cases and criterion b was satisfied in 20 - 30% of cases .",
    "these results are pretty much independent of the initial resonant sequence between saturn and the ice giants .",
    "all successful jobs show jupiter encounters and have @xmath60% chance of simultaneously matching criteria c and d as well (  4.8 ) .",
    "only @xmath03% of simulations performed for the four - planet case with ( 3:2,3:2,4:3 ) , @xmath49 au , and @xmath61 , satisfy criteria a and b , _ and _ show encounters of one of the ice giants to jupiter .",
    "the statistics for other resonances is similarly low .",
    "consequently , in absence of jupiter encounters , jupiter and saturn end up too close to each other if @xmath62 , and their orbits are too circular .",
    "larger disk masses produce more plausible final period ratios , as jupiter and saturn can slowly separate from each other by scattering planetesimals , but these evolution paths do not satisfy criterion d. overall , the criterion d was satisfied only in @xmath01% of the four - planet cases , which is troubling .",
    "for a comparison , practically in all five - planet simulations reported here , all planets , including jupiter , participate in planetary encounters .",
    "for example , the criterion d was satisfied in 50% of cases that also satisfied a and b for ( 3:2,3:2,4:3,5:4 ) , @xmath61 and @xmath36 au ( fig . [ per ] ) , and in over 60% of good cases for ( 2:1,3:2,3:2,4:3 ) , @xmath63 and @xmath64 au .",
    "we analyzed our simulations to determine the fraction of cases in which the secular structure of the final systems was similar to that of the present solar system .",
    "we did not use the jupiter s encounters as a proxy for good cases ( batygin & brown 2010 ) , because we found that most simulations with jupiter s encounters did not satisfy our criterion c ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "in fact , the overall success rate for the criterion c was disappointingly low , both for the four- and five - planet systems .",
    "in most cases , the initial eccentricity of jupiter , or the one excited by planetary encounters , was damped by planetesimals passing through @xmath65 au , so that @xmath66 in the end .",
    "this problem could most easily be resolved for low initial masses of the planetesimal disk , because in this case , the @xmath25 amplitude initial or produced by the planetary encounters will most likely survive . as planets can easily be ejected for low @xmath41 , more than four initial planets will probably be required .",
    "still , to make things work for the promising five - planet case , the success in matching the criteria a and b should be improved for low @xmath41 , because the systems studied here with @xmath67 were generally too violent .",
    "this could be achieved , for example , by including some sort of dissipation in the planetesimal disk , possibly produced by the collisions between planetesimals .",
    "the formation of uranus and neptune is a long - standing problem in planetary science , because their accretion at @xmath020 and @xmath030 au would require implausibly long timescales ( safronov 1969 , levison & stewart 2001 ) .",
    "the ice giants can form more easily at @xmath3215 au , where densities are higher and dynamical timescales are shorter ( e.g. , robinson & bodenheimer 2010 , jakubk et al . 2011 ) .",
    "our five - planet resonant systems start with all ice giant at @xmath3215 au , if jupiter and saturn are in the 3:2 resonance .",
    "if jupiter and saturn start in the 2:1 resonance , on the other hand , the whole planetary system is more spread , and the outer ice giant is at @xmath018 - 20 au , where its formation can be problematic .",
    "future work will need to address these issues ."
