    "the duffing oscillator is generally used to describe nonlinear dynamics in oscillating systems @xcite . the corresponding duffing equation models a damping and driven oscillator with more complicated behavior than simple harmonic motion , which can be used to exhibit chaos in dynamics and hysteresis in resonance @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the motion of trapped ions is highly controllable and can be employed to transfer quantum information when cooled down to ground state @xcite .",
    "since it is effectively approximated to be harmonic , the ion motion in a quadruple electromagnetic trap @xcite can be regarded as a good mechanical oscillator , which may exhibit nonlinearity when driven to the nonlinear field .",
    "for example , duffing nonlinear dynamics has been investigated in a single ion confined in the linear ion trap @xcite .",
    "the trap nonlinearity introduces instability in the motion of the ion , which should be avoided in most times , but can also be used in resonance rejection and parameter detection in mass spectrometry @xcite .",
    "recent research also showed the feasibility of phonon lasers based on the nonlinearity of a single trapped ion under laser irradiation @xcite .",
    "we focus in this work on the nonlinearity in a home - built surface - electrode trap ( set ) .",
    "the set , with capability to localize and transport trapped ions in different potential wells , is a promising setup for large - scale quantum information processing @xcite . in comparison to conventional linear paul traps , however , the reduced size and asymmetry in set lead to stronger high - order multipole potentials @xcite , which affect the stability of the ion trapping . to solve the problem we have to understand the source and the strength of the nonlinearity .",
    "due to complexity resulted from the high - order multipole potentials , the nonlinear effect in the set can not be simply described by the duffing oscillator as for the linear trap , but an inhomogeneous - coupled duffing oscillator involving quadratic and cubic nonlinearities .",
    "we observed the nonlinearity experimentally in our set , and by the method of multiple scales we derived an inhomogeneous - coupled duffing oscillator to fit the experimental values , which shows that both the nonlinearity and axial - radial coupling exist in the case of the frequency resonance ( i.e. , around the regime of driving detuning being zero ) .",
    "moreover , we show in the non - coupling case different nonlinear effects in different dimensions , which is due to different asymmetry in fabrication of the set .",
    "the @xmath0 ion is cooled by the laser beam at 397 nm on the @xmath1 transition , helped by another laser light at 866 nm as repumping . here , the trapped ion is above the electrodes by 0.8 mm ( see the bottom - right inset).,width=8 ]    our home - built set is a 500 @xmath2m - scaled planar trap with five electrodes for radial confinement , and fabricated by printed circuit board technology @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , the five electrodes consists of a central electrode , two radio - frequency ( rf ) electrodes and two outer segmented dc electrodes , where the rf electrodes , the central electrode and the gaps in between are of the same width of 500 @xmath3 m .",
    "each outer segmented electrode consists of five component electrodes , i.e. , a middle electrode , two control electrodes and two end electrodes .",
    "the widths of the control electrodes and end electrodes in the segment are 1.5 mm and the middle electrode is 1 mm wide .",
    "the gap in the segmented electrode is of 500 @xmath3 m width .",
    "when the set works , the trapped @xmath0 ion stays above the electrodes by @xmath4 mm , and the pseudopotential trapping depth is below @xmath5 ev with rf amplitude @xmath6(0-peak)@xmath7 v and rf frequency @xmath8 mhz .",
    "the voltage on the four end electrodes is @xmath9 v but zero on other electrodes .        the experimental setup is plotted in fig .",
    "2 , where the ultraviolet radiation at @xmath10 nm excites @xmath11 transition by a grating stabilized laser diode with power up to @xmath12 mw and linewidth less than 2 mhz .",
    "another grating stabilized laser diode at @xmath13 nm with power up to 100 mw and linewidth less than 5 mhz excites the @xmath14 transition .",
    "the frequencies of the both laser diodes have been calibrated to the wavelength meter ( highfiness , ws-7 ) .",
    "typical laser powers at the trap center are 50 @xmath3w for 397 nm in red detuning ( -80 mhz ) and 500 @xmath3w for 866 nm in carrier transition . in our set ,",
    "the single @xmath0 ion is laser cooled and stably confined , which is monitored by photon scattering collected by both an electron - multiplying charge - coupled - device ( emccd ) camera and a photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) . outside the vacuum chamber",
    ", the electrical connections immediately encounter a `` filter box '' , which provides low - pass filtering of the voltages applied to the electrode . an additional drive force is electrically connected to one of the middle electrodes behind the filter box , which provides an excitation to drive the ion away from equilibrium . due to the design of our set system ,",
    "the motion of the ion is detected only in the @xmath15 plane by the emccd . as a result ,",
    "what we study throughout the work is the oscillation along the axial direction ( @xmath16-axis ) and the radial direction ( @xmath17-axis ) , whose harmonic frequencies are , respectively , @xmath18 khz and @xmath19 khz",
    ". moreover , since the harmonic frequency in @xmath20-axis is @xmath21 khz , much bigger than in other axes , the ion can be regarded as a very tight confinement in y direction .",
    "we have suppressed the micro - motion by the rf - photon cross correlation compensation @xcite , which yield cooling of the ion down to the temperature below 10 mk .",
    "to study the nonlinear mechanical response , we drive the ion to the nonlinear regime by a small oscillating voltage , i.e. , @xmath22 v , applied to one of the middle electrodes .",
    "we slowly increase the driving frequency with the scan step @xmath23 khz , from @xmath24 khz to @xmath25 khz ( the positive scan ) , the ion oscillates first along the @xmath16-axis and then turns to the @xmath17-axis for oscillation .",
    "the particularly interesting observation is the simultaneous responses , i.e. , a rectangle trajectory , in both @xmath17- and @xmath16- axes when the sweep is close to the harmonic resonator frequency in either of the axes .",
    "similar behavior is also found in the negative scan .",
    "we measure the ion oscillation by taking time - averaged images from the emccd . in fig .",
    "3 , seventeen such images for different drive frequencies are presented for positive and negative scans , respectively . for the ion originally oscillating in the @xmath16-axis , we slowly scan the drive frequency @xmath26 across the harmonic resonance at @xmath27 . when the detuning @xmath28 approaches zero , the rectangle trajectory appears , implying a coupled motion between @xmath17- and @xmath16-axes due to axial - radial coupling ( explained later ) . for a more clarified observation",
    ", we scan with smaller steps around the regime @xmath29 , as shown in fig . 4 which gives us an accurate range from the appearance of the rectangle to the disappearance .",
    "to understand the observation above , we have to consider the multipole potential in the set , which is given by @xcite @xmath30 where the subscript @xmath31 labels different electrodes and the subscript @xmath32 is for the spherical harmonics @xmath33 . both @xmath34 and the related parameters @xmath35 are defined in littich .",

( 1 ) for the dc potential @xmath43 and the rf potential @xmath44 as @xmath45where we have used @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",

    "( 5 ) , we obtain @xmath67",
    "in our home - built set , since the harmonic frequency in y - axis is much bigger than in other axes , the ion is confined very tightly in y direction , which leads to a reasonable assumption @xmath681 . as a result",

    "we evaluate @xmath86 hz using the relation @xmath87 .",
    "the comparison in the non - coupling case between the measured and calculated values of @xmath59 and @xmath77 is made in fig .",
    "5(a ) , where eq . ( 9 ) without the coupling term @xmath88 ( the black solid curve ) can fit most experimental values for both the positive and negative scans ( red stars and green crosses , respectively ) .",
    "in this situation , the vibrational amplitude @xmath57 in @xmath17-axis is negligible .",
    "some experimental values around @xmath89 , which are not fitted well by the solid curve , are actually relevant to the case of coupled motion .",
    "to be more clarified , we scan the region around @xmath89 with smaller step than in fig",
    "the fitting by considering the coupling term @xmath88 in our calculation can fully cover the measured data , as shown in fig .",
    "in such a case , we find that the vibrational amplitude @xmath57 in @xmath17-axis is visible , which is excited by the energy transfer from @xmath16-axis due to motional coupling .",

    "in conclusion , we have experimentally investigated the complicated oscillations in our home - built set , which are related to the high - order multipole potentials .",
    "both the coupling and non - coupling cases , as well as the driving along different axes , are studied .",
    "our observation can be fully understood by the nonlinear effects and the motional coupling from the solution of a complicated duffing oscillator .    in comparison to the relevant study on a single ion oscillating in the linear trap @xcite , our home - made set owns higher - order multipole potentials , which cause more fruitful nonlinear effects and even the motional coupling between different directions .",
    "although there are also axial - radial couplings observed in the ion trap , e.g. , with ion cloud in cloud , such a motional coupling is much more evident in the set , which , in addition to the couplings regarding @xmath98 and @xmath99 , is also reflected in the @xmath100 term in eq .",
    "( 4 ) with the coefficient @xmath101 .",
    "according to our calculation , the motional coupling in our observation is mainly influenced by the coefficients @xmath101 and @xmath102 , which implies the combined action from the quadrupole , hexapole and octopole potentials .",
    "this is the reason that the rectangle trajectories have never been observed previously in linear ion traps .",
    "moreover , recent investigation of the phonon laser based on the nonlinear oscillation of the trapped ion demonstrated the analogy to the fabry - perot laser with 100% reflecting mirrors @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the set under our study seems an asymmetry fabry - perot cavity , which may yield two split beams of the phonon laser in perpendicular axes .",
    "coherent transfer between the two split phonon beams would be useful in fundamental physics and practical application .",
    "further work in this aspect is underway .    with the trapped ions cooled down to the motional ground state",
    ", we may have an excellent platform to demonstrate nonlinear behavior in a fully quantum mechanical regime and also carry out quantum logic gate operations .",
