    "charmonium spectroscopy is of great interest to both the experimentalists and the theorists since its first discovery more than 30 years ago . with the successful running of the two @xmath14-factories at slac and kek , charmonium physics",
    "was also revitalized as more and more charmonium and charmonium - like states were observed in @xmath14 decays , in initial state radiation ( @xmath15 ) processes , in double - charmonium productions , and in two - photon processes .",
    "the observation of the @xmath16  @xcite , @xmath8  @xcite , @xmath17  @xcite and so on may suggest the existence of new type of hadronic states besides the conventional mesons ( @xmath18 ) and baryons ( @xmath19 ) in quark model . among these many newly observed states ,",
    "those with @xmath20 are becoming very puzzling since there are too many of them between 4 - 5  gev/@xmath4 than expected from the potential models  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the excited @xmath21 states observed in the inclusive hadronic cross section  @xcite ( the @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) , there are four new structures observed in @xmath15 processes ( the @xmath25  @xcite , @xmath8  @xcite , @xmath1  @xcite , @xmath2  @xcite ) .",

    "a close examination of the babar observation shows that there is one bin with high cross section at around the second resonance observed in belle experiment although it is not very significant .    in this paper",
    ", we try to perform a combined fit to @xmath0 cross sections measured by the babar and belle experiments with two resonances , to obtain a better estimation of the resonant parameters of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
