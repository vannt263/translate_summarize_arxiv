    "the nested error regression ( ner ) model with normality assumption for both the random effects or model error terms and the unit - level error terms has played a key role in analyzing unit - level data in small area estimation .",
    "many popular small area estimation methods have been developed under this model . in the frequentist approach , battese et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , prasad and rao ( 1990 ) , datta and lahiri ( 2000 ) , for example , derived empirical best linear unbiased predictors ( eblups ) of small area means .",
    "these authors used various estimation methods for the variance components and derived approximately accurate estimators of mean squared error ( mses ) of the eblups . on the other hand ,",
    "datta and ghosh ( 1991 ) followed the hierarchical bayesian ( hb ) approach to derive posterior means as hb predictors and variances of the small area means .",
    "while the underlying normality assumptions for all the random quantities are appropriate for regular data , they fail to adequately accommodate outliers .",
    "consequently , these frequentist / bayesian methods , are highly influenced by major outliers in the data , or break down if the outliers grossly violate distributional assumptions .",
    "sinha and rao ( 2009 ) investigated robustness , or lack thereof , of the eblups from the usual normal ner model in presence of `` representative outliers '' . according to chambers ( 1986 ) ,",
    "a representative outlier is a `` sample element with a value that has been correctly recorded and can not be regarded as unique . in particular , there is no reason to assume that there are no more similar outliers in the nonsampled part of the population . ''",
    "sinha and rao ( 2009 ) showed via simulations for the ner model that while the eblups are efficient under normality , they are very sensitive to outliers that deviate from the assumed model .    to address the non - robustness issue of eblups , sinha and rao ( 2009 ) used @xmath0-function , huber s proposal 2 influence function in m - estimation , to downweight contribution of outliers in the blups and the estimators of the model parameters , both regression coefficients and variance components . using m - estimation for robust maximum likelihood estimators of model parameters and robust predictors of random effects , sinha and rao ( 2009 ) for mixed linear models",
    "proposed a robust eblup ( reblup ) of mixed effects , which they used to estimate small area means for the ner model . by using a parametric bootstrap procedure",
    "they have also developed estimators of the mses of the reblups .",
    "we refer to sinha and rao ( 2009 ) for details of this method .",
    "their simulations show that when the normality assumptions hold , the proposed reblups perform similar to the eblups in terms of empirical bias and empirical mse .",
    "but , in presence of outliers in the unit - level errors , while both eblups and reblups remain approximately unbiased , the empirical mses of the eblups are significantly larger than those of the reblups .",
    "datta and ghosh ( 1991 ) proposed a noninformative hb model to predict finite population small area means . in this article",
    "we follow the approach to finite population sampling which was also followed by datta and ghosh ( 1991 ) .",
    "our suggested model includes the treatment of ner model by datta and ghosh ( 1991 ) as a special case .",
    "our model facilitates accommodating outliers in the population and in the sample values .",
    "we replace the normality of the unit - level error terms by a two - component mixture of normal distributions , each component centered at zero . as in datta and ghosh ( 1991 ) , we assume normality of the small area effects",
    ".    simulation results of sinha and rao ( 2009 ) indicated that there was not enough improvement in performance of the reblup procedures over the eblups when they considered outliers in both the unit - level error and the model error terms . to keep both analytical and computational challenges for our noninformative hb analysis manageable",
    ", we use a realistic framework and we restrict ourselves to the normality assumption for the random effects .",
    "moreover , the assumption of zero means for the unit - level error terms is similar to the assumption made by sinha and rao ( 2009 ) . while allowing the component of the unit - level error terms with the bigger variance to also have non - zero means to accommodate outliers might appear attractive , we note it later that it is not possible to conduct a noninformative bayesian analysis with an improper prior on the new parameter .",
    "we focus only unit - level model robust small area estimation in this article .",
    "there is a substantial literature on small area estimation based on area - level data using fay - herriot model ( see fay and herriot , 1979 ; prasad and rao , 1990 ) .",
    "the paper by sinha and rao ( 2009 ) also discussed robust small area estimation for area - level model . in another paper , lahiri and rao ( 1995 ) discussed eblup and estimation of mse under non - normality assumption for the random effects .",
    "an early robust bayesian approach for area - level model is due to datta and lahiri ( 1995 ) , where they used scale mixture of normal distributions for the random effects .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the @xmath1-distributions are special cases of scale mixture of normal distributions . while datta and lahiri ( 1995 ) assumed long - tailed distributions for the random effects , bell and huang ( 2006 ) used hb method based on @xmath1 distribution , either only for the unit - level errors or only for the model errors .",
    "bell and huang ( 2006 ) assumed that outliers can arise either in model errors or in unit - level errors .",
    "the scale mixture of normal distributions requires specification of the mixing distribution , or in the specific case for @xmath1 distributions , it requires the degrees of freedom . in an attempt to avoid this specification , in a recent article chakraborty et al .",
    "( 2016 ) proposed a simple alternative via a two - component mixture of normal distributions in terms of the variance components for the model errors .",
    "the model - based approach to finite population sampling is very useful to model unit - level data in small area estimation .",
    "the ner model of battese et al .",
    "( 1988 ) is a popular model for unit - level data .",
    "suppose a finite population is partitioned into @xmath2 small areas , with @xmath3th area having @xmath4 units .",
    "the ner model relates @xmath5 , the value of a response variable @xmath6 for the @xmath7th unit in the @xmath3th small area , with @xmath8 , the value of a @xmath9-component covariate vector associated with that unit , through a mixed linear model given by @xmath10 where all the random variables @xmath11 s and @xmath12 s are assumed independent .",
    "distributions of these variables are specified by assuming that random effects @xmath13 and unit - level errors @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 is the regression coefficient vector .",
    "we want to predict the @xmath3th small area finite population mean @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "battese et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , prasad and rao ( 1990 ) , among others , considered noninformative sampling , where a simple random sample of size @xmath18 is selected from the @xmath3th small area . for notational simplicity",
    "we denote the sample by @xmath19 . to develop predictors of small area",
    "means @xmath20 , these authors first derived , for known model parameters , the conditional distribution of the _ unsampled _ values , @xmath21 , given the sampled values @xmath22 . under squared error loss , the best predictor of @xmath23 is its mean with respect to this conditional distribution , also known as predictive distribution . in the frequentist approach , battese et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , prasad and rao ( 1990 ) obtained the eblup of @xmath24 by replacing in the conditional mean the unknown model parameters @xmath25 by their estimators using @xmath26 . in the bayesian approach ,",
    "on the other hand , datta and ghosh ( 1991 ) developed hb predictors of @xmath23 by integrating out these parameters in the conditional mean of @xmath24 with respect to their posterior density , which is derived based on a prior distribution on the parameters and the distribution of the sample @xmath26 , derived under the model ( [ ner - bhf ] ) .",
    "while the frequentist approach for the ner model under distributional assumptions in ( [ ner - bhf ] ) continues with accurate approximation and estimation of the mses of the eblups , the bayesian approach typically proceeds under some noninformative priors , and computes numerically , usually by mcmc method , the exact posterior means and variances of @xmath24 s . among various noninformative priors for @xmath27 , a popular choice is @xmath28 ( see , for example , datta and ghosh , 1991 ) .",
    "the standard ner model in ( [ ner - bhf ] ) is unable to explain outlier behavior of unit - level error terms . to avoid breakdown of eblups and their mses in presence of outliers , sinha and rao ( 2009 ) modified all estimating equations for the model parameters and random effects terms by robustifying various `` standardaized residuals '' that appear in estimating equations by using huber s @xmath0-function , which truncates large absolute values to a certain threshold .",
    "they did not replace the working ner model in ( [ ner - bhf ] ) to accommodate outliers , but they accounted for their potential impacts on the eblups and estimated mses by downweighting large standardized residuals that appear in various estimating equations through huber s @xmath0-function .",
    "their approach , in the terminology of chambers et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , may be termed _ robust projective _ , where they estimated the working model in a robust fashion and used that to project sample non - outlier behavior to the unsampled part of the model .    to investigate the effectiveness of their proposal ,",
    "sinha and rao ( 2009 ) conducted simulations based on various long - tailed distributions for the random effects and/or the unit - level error terms . in one of their simulation scenarios which is reasonably simple but useful , they used a two - component mixture of normal distributions for the unit - level error terms , both components centered at zero but with unequal variances , and the component with the larger variance appears with a small probability .",
    "this reflects the regular setup of the ner model with the possibility of outliers arising as a small fraction of contamination caused by the error corresponding to the larger variance component . in this article",
    ", we incorporate this mixture distribution to modify the model in ( [ ner - bhf ] ) to develop new bayesian methods that would be robust to outliers .",
    "our proposed population level hb model is given by    nm hb model :    * conditional on @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 * the indicator variables @xmath32 s are iid with @xmath33 and are independent of @xmath34 and @xmath30 .",
    "* conditional on @xmath35 and @xmath30 , random small area effects @xmath13 for @xmath36 .    for simplicity",
    ", we assume the contamination probability @xmath37 to remain the same for all units in all small areas .",
    "gershunskaya ( 2010 ) proposed this mixture model for empirical bayes point estimation of small area means .",
    "we assume independent simple random samples of size @xmath38 from the @xmath2 small areas .",
    "for simplicity of notation , we denote the responses for the sampled units from the @xmath3th small area by @xmath39 , @xmath17 .",
    "the srs results in a noninformative sample and that the joint distribution of responses of the sampled units can be obtained from the nm hb model above by replacing @xmath4 by @xmath18 . this marginal distribution in combination with the prior distribution provided below will yield the posterior distribution of @xmath11 s , and all the parameters in the model .",
    "for the informative sampling development in small area estimation we refer to pfeffermann and sverchkov ( 2007 ) and verret et al .",
    "( 2015 ) .",
    "two components of the normal mixture distribution differ only by their variances",
    ". we will assume the variance component @xmath40 is larger than @xmath41 and is intended to explain any outliers in a data set .",
    "however , if a data set does not include any outliers , the two component variances @xmath42 may only minimally differ .",
    "in such situation , the likelihood based on the sample will include limited information to distinguish between these variance parameters , and consequently , the likelihood will also have little information about the mixing proportion @xmath37 .",
    "we notice this behavior in our application to a subset of the corn data in section [ sec : data ] .    in this article , we carry out an objective bayesian analysis by assigning a noninformative prior to the model parameters .",
    "in particular , we propose a noninformative prior @xmath43 where we have assigned an improper prior on @xmath44 and a proper uniform prior on the mixing proportion @xmath37 .",
    "however , subjective priors could also be assigned when such subjective information is available .",
    "notably , it is possible to use some other proper prior on @xmath37 that may elicit the extent of contamination to the basic model to reflect prevalence of outliers .",
    "while many such subjective prior can be reasonably modeled by a beta distribution , we use a _ uniform distribution _ from this class to reflect noninformativeness or little information about this parameter .",
    "we also use traditional uniform prior on @xmath45 and @xmath30 .",
    "the improper prior distribution on the two variances for the mixture distribution has been carefully chosen so that the prior will yield conditionally proper distribution for each parameter given the other .",
    "this conditional propriety is _ necessary _ for parameters appearing in the mixture distribution in order to ensure under suitable conditions the propriety of the posterior density resulting from the hb model .",
    "the specific prior distribution that we propose above is such that the resulting marginal densities for @xmath41 and @xmath40 respectively , are @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "these two densities are of the same form as that of @xmath48 in the regular model in ( [ pop - prior - bhf ] ) introduced earlier . indeed by setting @xmath49 or @xmath50 in our analysis , we can reproduce the hb analysis of the regular model given by ( [ ner - bhf ] ) and ( [ pop - prior - bhf ] ) .",
    "we use the nm hb model under noninformative sampling and the noninformative priors given by ( [ new - prior ] ) to derive the posterior predictive distribution of @xmath51 .",
    "the nm hb model and noninformative sampling that we propose here facilitate building model for _ representative outliers _ ( chambers , 1986 ) . according to chambers ,",
    "a representative outlier is a value of a sampled unit which is not regarded as unique in the population , and one can expect existence of similar values in the non - sampled part of the population which will influence the value of the finite population means @xmath24 s or the other parameters involved in the superpopulation model .    following the practice of battese et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and prasad and rao ( 1990 ) , we approximated the predictand @xmath24 by @xmath52 to draw inference on the finite population small area means . here",
    "@xmath53 is assumed known .",
    "this approximation works well for small sampling fractions @xmath54 and large @xmath4 s .",
    "it has been noted by these authors , and by sinha and rao ( 2009 ) , that even for the case of outliers in the sample the difference between the inference results for @xmath24 and @xmath55 is negligible .",
    "our own simulations for our model also confirm that .",
    "once mcmc samples from the posterior distribution of @xmath56 s and @xmath57 have been generated , using the nm hb model the mcmc samples of @xmath58 from their posterior predictive distributions can be easily generated . finally ,",
    "using the relation @xmath59 $ ] , ( posterior predictive ) mcmc samples for @xmath24 s can be easily generated for inference on these quantities . in our own data",
    "anaysis , where the sampling fractions are negligible , we do inference for the approximated predictands @xmath55 s .",
    "chambers and tzavidis ( 2006 ) took a new frequentist approach to small area estimation that is different from the mixed model prediction used in eblup .",
    "instead of using a mixed model for the response , they suggeted a method based on quantile regression .",
    "we briefly review their m - quantile small area estimation method in section [ mq - rev ] .",
    "they also proposed an estimator of mse of their point estimators .",
    "our bayesian proposal has two advantages over the reblup of sinha and rao ( 2009 ) .",
    "first , instead of a working model for the non - outliers , we use an explicit mixture model to specify the joint distribution of responses of all the units in the population , and not only the non - outliers part of the population .",
    "it enables us to use all the sampled observations to predict the entire non - sampled part , consisting of outliers and non - outliers , of the population .",
    "our method is robust predictive and the noninformative hb predictors are less susceptible to bias .",
    "second , the main thrust of the eblup approach in small area estimation is to develop accurate approximations and estimation of mses of eblups ( cf .",
    "prasad and rao , 1990 ) .",
    "datta and lahiri ( 2000 ) and datta et al .",
    "( 2005 ) termed this approximation as second - order accurate approximation , which neglects terms lower order than @xmath60 in the approximation .",
    "second - order accurate approximation results for reblups have not been obtained by sinha and rao ( 2009 ) .",
    "also , their bootstrap proposal to estimation of the mse under the working model has not been shown to be second - order accurate .",
    "our hb proposal does not rely on any asymptotic approximations .",
    "analysis of the corn data set and simulation study show better stability and less uncertainty of our method compared to the m - quantile method .",
    "since improper prior distribution has been used in the hb model above , it is important to explore the propriety of the resulting posterior distribution in order to avoid misleading results based on improper posteriors ( cf .",
    "hobert and casella , 1996 ) . in the following results , we first provide sufficient conditions for the propriety of the resulting posterior distribution based on the proposed model .",
