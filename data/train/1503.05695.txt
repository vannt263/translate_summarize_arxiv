    "bscir = hd125630=hip70346 , is a moderately cool magnetic chemically peculiar star of the srcreu type with the modest rotational period @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "bscir  has strong antiphase light variations in @xmath7 and @xmath3 ( see fig.[krivky ] ) , large @xmath0 amplitude ( see fig.[c1index ] ) .    combining all available kinematic , photometric and spectroscopic data about the star , we derived the following astrophysical parameters : @xmath8myr .",
    "the star has a moderate global magnetic field of bipolar strength @xmath9 of several kg @xcite .",
    "bscir  was observed in 1975 - 6 by @xcite in @xmath10 and then in 1980 by @xcite who revealed the star to be photometrically variable with a period @xmath11 .",
    "data set of @xcite was later reanalysed and the found period was confirmed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite then added @xcite data to their 56 precise @xmath12 measurements taken in 1991 and determined the period to @xmath13 . as they did not consider @xcite data they could be mistaken in the total number of cycles between 1980 and 1991 ( @xmath14d ) by one @xmath15 .",
    "this false period is given in later catalogues and articles excluding the period list of @xcite containing automatically found periods and types of variable stars in the hipparcos survey .",
    "bscir  is there announced as an eclipsing binary with the period of 11020 ( the half of the true value ) .    ) with the contrasts depending on the effective wavelengths .",
    "the rotational phase is calculated according to the ephemeris with a quadratic term ( eq.[efemerida ] ) .",
    "the area of individual full circles are equal to their weights .",
    "the sources of all used photometric data plot are listed in tab.[tab1].,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    the true period should be given by the relation : @xmath16 .",
    "this period was then fully confirmed by our period analysis of all above mentioned data sets replenished by hipparcos @xcite , asas @xcite , integral @xcite , and pi of the sky @xcite survey photometries .",

    "light curves in individual colours , plotted according to quadratic phase ( see sec.[kvadrat ] ) , display very disparate shape ( see fig.[krivky ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , we have ascertained that all of them can be well described by a simple phenomenological model assuming the presence of two uneven symmetric photometric spots centered to phases @xmath19 and @xmath20 , with half - widths @xmath21 : @xmath22},\\label{model}\\\\ & \\varphi_k=(\\varphi-\\varphi_{0k})-\\mathrm{round}(\\varphi-\\varphi_{0k}),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the model prediction of the magnitude of observation done in the filter of the effective wavelength @xmath24 , @xmath25 are the amplitudes of both photometric spots in a photometric colour with the wavelength @xmath24 , @xmath26 is the mean magnitude of the @xmath27-th set of photometric observations , @xmath28 are the half - widths of the light curves of relevant photometric spots expressed in phases , @xmath29 is the phase determined according to quadratic ephemeris ( see eq.[efemerida ] ) , and @xmath30 are the phases of the centers of the spots .",
    "the model allowed to use all available photometric data and served as the general model for the fine period diagnostics described in sec.[kvadrat ] .",
    "dependence of amplitudes on the effective wavelengths indicates that light curves of the star in individual colours are the result of at least two different variability mechanisms .",
    "our research of the spectrum of bscir  is based on the analysis of 30 spectrograms obtained by us in 2011 - 12 at la silla observatory using spectrograph feros @xmath31 attached to the 2.2 m mpg / eso telescope .",

    "all lines are heavily blended , spectrum is completely covered by lines and no continuum is visible .",
    "line spectrum is apparently variable in intensity and line profile .",
    "the brief inspection of spectrograms covering substantial part of a phase diagram led us to the finding that phase curves of line intensities of the most of chemical elements mimic light curves ( double waves , dominant the primary spot ) , however relative changes in intensities of metals are relatively small and very likely insufficient to produce the observed pronounced changes in light .",
    "the agreement between phase curves of metal line intensities is not perfect - we see here a systematic shift of 0.1 of the period .",
    "the strongest variations exhibit lines , phase curves of which can be expressed by the lc model ( see eq.[model ] ) without any shift .",
    "we speculate that there are two causes of the observed bscir  light variations : 1 )  redistribution of the stellar flux from far uv to near uv and the optical region due to uneven abundances of metals , 2 ) changes in the magnitude of the balmer jump due to variable pollution of the atmosphere by metals and namely re ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the prevailing majority of mcp stars display constant periods and stable shapes of light curves what implies that these stars are rotating as a solid body and surface structures stabilized by strong surface global magnetic field is persistent in time scales of centuries .",
    "nevertheless , there were revealed a few of altogether hot mcp stars as very hot @xmath33 orie @xcite and v901 ori @xcite , or hot fastly rotating cu vir @xcite exhibiting almost continuous variations in their observed periods @xcite .",
    "we @xcite speculate in the last two mentioned stars that dynamic interactions between a thin , outer magnetically - confined envelope , braked by the stellar wind , with an inner , faster rotating stellar body are able to explain the observed rotational variability .",

    "it indicates that the observed period of light variations is lengthening more or less linearly with the rate : @xmath34 .",

    "it means that during the last 39 years the period of the star lengthened by @xmath37 yr .",
    "the second period derivative ( @xmath38 is nearly zero ) .",
    "we have derived the quadratic orthogonal ephemeris for the phase function @xmath39 which origin was put in the weighted center of our photometric data : @xmath40 where @xmath41 are auxiliary variables or constants , @xmath42 is the selected origin of the phase function @xmath39 for linear approximation : @xmath43 , the mean period @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath44 is the common epoch and @xmath45 is the quadratic phase .",
    ".the list of sources of individual photometric data of bscir  contains : the mean hjd datum of measurements , o - c in days versus the quadratic ephemeris ( [ efemerida ] ) , the used filters , the number of observations , and the citation of the source . [ cols=\"^,<,^,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab1 ]    the lite period changes due to variable radial velocity caused by orbital motion in the system of 2 bodies ( spectroscopically invisible companion ) can be excluded because we have not noted any variations in radial velocity of the star .",
    "@xcite predicted precession of magnetically distorted stars .",
    "it should cause also marginal cyclic of light curves and period variations .",
    "@xcite showed that the constancy of the light curves shapes and the extent of the observed period variations of v901 ori and cu vir evidently overcoming the limit allowed by the precessional model ( see the appendix of the article of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) excluded the precession as the explanation for period changes of these notorious mcp stars .",
    "nevertheless , total variation of bscir  in phase is not so large : @xmath46 , consequently we can not excluded that it might be caused by the stellar precession .",
    "this explanation is supported by finding of small long - term changes in shape of light curve ( amplitude of both spots decreases ) while the phase distance between centers of the spots remains constant .",
    "* we observed the moderately cool southern mcp star bscir   both photometrically and spectroscopically . *",
    "we improved the ephemeris of light variations and successfully modeled light curves in the region 350 - 750 nm by two nearly opposite different photometric spots .",
    "* we revealed changes in the depths of , , , and lines correlated with light variations .",
    "the nature of photometric spots of moderately cool mcp  stars was briefly discussed . * using all available photometric data we have found well documented lengthening of the observed period and long - term changes in bscir  light curve shapes .",
    "the facts could be explained by the free precession of the aspheric star deformed by its magnetic field .",
    "this paper uses observations made at the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) .",
