    "pulse arrival times were measured in a multi - step iterative process , similar to the analysis in thompson et al .",
    "first , each individual observation was divided into @xmath61.5 ks `` light segments '' ( @xmath634 pulse cycles ) , and each segment was folded modulo 414.0 s to improve statistics . although the true pulse period may differ slightly from this value , we expect smearing of the pulsation to be minimal , leading to systematic errors in the measured pulse arrival times of @xmath17 1 s. exo 1722 - 363  is known to be an eclipsing system ( corbet et al .",
    "zurita heras et al . ( 2006 ) found that the _ integral _ isgri flux drops to zero during the eclipse .",

    "was calculated .",
    "based on the null hypothesis that the light segments are consistent with a constant flux , pulse minima were only measured if the null hypothesis was rejected at the 1% level of significance .",
    "while this may exclude data when the pulsar is out of eclipse , we prefer to be conservative and potentially exclude usable segments rather than include segments in eclipse . with the orbital solution obtained in   3.1 , we find that all excluded light curves are within @xmath19 , where mid - eclipse is defined to be orbital phase 0.0 .",
    "the eclipse duration implies that pulsations should be observable at phase 0.1 .",
    "therefore , although all of the excluded observations occurred near the eclipse , they did not necessarily take place during the eclipse .",
    "the light segments that were not consistent with a constant were then manually aligned to create a preliminary pulse template .",
    "each light segment was cross correlated with the preliminary pulse template , and the cross correlation lag times were then used to create a more refined pulse template .",

    "stellar wind flowing past a compact object is affected by a number of competing forces ( gravitational , rotational , and radiation pressure ) , and photoionization of the stellar wind can create an accretion wake ( fransson & fabian 1980 ) . in addition , if the orbital separation is small enough , tidal distortion of the surface of the primary can lead to enhanced mass loss through the inner lagrangian point @xmath166 along the line of centers even if the primary does not fill its roche lobe ( friend & castor 1982 ) .",
    "the presence of a tidal stream depends sensitively on the separation of the primary and the compact object , and only becomes apparent when the radius of the primary is greater than 95% of the radius of its roche lobe ( blondin et al .",
    "1991 ) . even if a tidal tream is not present , the simulations by blondin et al .",
    "( 1990 ) are described by the formation of nonsteady accretion wakes that produce dense filaments in the downstream wake .",
    "if the filaments are along the line - of - sight to the pulsar , which is likely to occur at orbital phases 0.51.0 , the observed hydrogen column density will increase by a factor of a few to 10 , qualitatively consistent with the phase - dependent photoelectric absorption seen in exo 1722 - 363 .",
    "models including a significant tidal stream show weak or altogether absent changes in the sign of the accreted angular momentum ( blondin et al . 1991 ) .",
    "while the connection of pulses from 2003 august to 2006 march using a single pulse period derivative is indicative of a stable accretion process over the 2.4 yr span ( spinning up the neutron star ) , the orbital solution unambiguously shows that at least one torque reversal occurred between 1998 november and 2003 august : the pulse period increased from 413.85 s to 414.65 s between late 1998 and 2003 august , but has been steadily decreasing through early 2006 .",
    "note that the low - energy light curve of exo 1722 - 363 showed no dips , and so there is no evidence for a persistent accretion disk .",
    "the spin - down therefore occurred sometime between 1998 november and 2003 august .",
    "such spin - down can occur via the  propeller effect \" ( illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) , or if there are significant azimuthal gradients in the wind density or velocity near the compact object ( wang 1981 ) , however , as mentioned above , a torque reversal is inconsistent with the simulations predicting increases in absorption at later phases due to a dominant tidal stream .    observations of phase variability of the column density in vela x-1 and 4u 1700 - 37 qualitatively agree with that seen in exo 1722 - 363 , with significantly higher absorption after @xmath167 ( e.g. , haberl 1989 ; haberl et al .",
    "1989 ; charles et al .",
    "a base level column density is seen to be reproducible over many orbits , along with a highly variable component causing @xmath62 to increase by an order of magnitude over the base level , usually appearing at later phases .",
    "this variable component is suggested by blondin et al .",
    "( 1991 ) to result from separate clumps of material formed by dynamical instabilities in the accretion bow shock .",
    "interestingly , one of the narrow peaks in vela x-1 consistently appears at phase 0.5 , and we see similar behavior , at least for one particular orbit , in exo 1722 - 363 .",
    "the picture that emerged above is one of the pulsar moving through the stellar wind of its b - type companion , affecting the distribution of matter through a number of competing processes , and possibly leading to a wake of dense material trailing the pulsar in its orbit .",
    "this material will also reprocess the radiation incident upon it , leading to fluorescent iron line emission .",
    "the interpretation of the variability of the fe k@xmath9 line is complicated because the equivalent width of the line depends on many factors , such as the spectrum of the continuum emission , and the distribution and density of the fluorescing material .",
    "the results of table 5 show that the photon index varies over a wide range throughout the orbit ( the photon index @xmath168 is consistent with values between -0.5 and 2.7 at the 90% confidence level ) , as does the hydrogen column density .",
    "the distribution of the surrounding matter is also expected to vary over the orbit , given the nature of stellar winds from massive stars and the effect of the pulsar on these winds .",
    "using monte carlo simulations , leahy & creighton ( 1993 ) found that an input spectrum with @xmath169 emerging from a uniform and spherically symmetric distribution of matter will lead to an iron line equivalent width of about 100 ev for a column density of @xmath165 @xmath11 .",
    "these authors also found that equivalent width increases approximately linearly below a column density of @xmath170 @xmath11 .",
    "an input spectrum with @xmath171 , on the other hand , results in equivalent widths about one - third as large , simply because a spectrum described by a steeper power law has relatively fewer photons above the iron k - edge .",
    "figure [ iron ] shows the column density versus the equivalent width of the iron line ( _ left _ panel ) , and the 7.124 kev continuum intensity versus the iron line flux ( _ right _ panel ) .",
    "unfortunately , upper limits on the iron line intensity were obtained for more than half of the spectra ( closed circles in the figure ) .",
    "also , the data points from spectra 3 and 19 were not included in the figure because the flux for these observations is only @xmath610% above the gre emission , and poor statistics lead to very weakly constrained equivalent widths .",
    "if we only consider the data points that are not consistent with zero ( open diamonds in the figure ) , one can see a rough correlation between the fe k@xmath9 equivalent width and the @xmath62 column density , but the magnitude of the equivalent width is systematically larger than that predicted by the leahy & creighton ( 1993 ) simulations .",
    "perhaps this reflects an iron abundance greater than the solar value .",
    "the dependence of the equivalent width on the iron abundance is linear when the optical depth is much less than one , but becomes less than linear when the effects of opacity become important ( matt 1997 ) .",
    "nevertheless , by including data points that are upper limits , this rough trend no longer exists .",
    "one factor that may contribute to the lack of a clear correlation is the significant variability of the photon index .",
    "the three largest values for the equivalent width ( disregarding upper limits ) are from the three spectra with the flattest power laws ( best - fit photon indexes of @xmath172 , 0.5 , & 0.9 , respectively ) , as we would expect .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ iron ] shows that the correlation between the iron line flux and the continuum intensity above the iron k - edge is better , though still not excellent .",
    "if the correlation were linear and the spectrum constant ( minus changes in absorption ) , it would indicate that the origin of the iron line is from the same material as is responsible for the absorption of the continuum .",
    "spectral variability makes such a comparison impossible , but we speculate that the pulsar may be illuminating matter that is not along its line of sight , and that may have a smaller .",
    "that the equivalent width increases near @xmath167 possibly indicates that a component of the fluorescing material is the surface of the primary .",
    "we have found the orbital solution to the eclipsing hmxb exo 1722 - 363  by applying pulse timing analysis to twenty recent _ rxte _ observations ( nearly evenly spaced in orbital phase ) and two sets of observations occurring 2.4 years and 7.3 years earlier . with the orbital solution",
    ", we constrained the nature of the mass - donating companion star , and we investigated the evolution of the spectrum through the pulsar s orbit .",

    "2 .   using the orbital solution and the eclipse half - angle measurement of @xmath13 from corbet et al .
