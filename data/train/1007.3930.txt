    "the experimental realization of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice ( graphene ) has prompted huge activity in both experimental and theoretical physics communities ( for reviews , see refs . ) .",
    "graphene in real experiments always has different kinds of disorder or impurities , such as ripples , adatoms , admolecules , etc .",
    "one of the most important problems in graphene physics , especially , keeping in mind potential applications of graphene in electronics , is understanding the effect of these imperfections on the electronic structure and transport properties .",
    "being massless dirac fermions with the wavelength much larger than the interatomic distance , charge carriers in graphene scatter rather weakly by generic short - range scattering centers , similar to weak light scattering from obstacles with sizes much smaller that the wavelength .",
    "the scattering theory for dirac electrons in two dimensions is discussed in refs . .",
    "long - range scattering centers are of special importance for transport properties , such as charge impurities @xcite , ripples created long - range elastic deformations @xcite , and resonant scattering centers peres2006,katsnelson2007,katsnelson2008,ostrovsky2006,stauber2007,titov2010 . in the latter case , the divergence of the scattering length provides a long - range scattering and a very slow , logarithmic , decay of the scattering phase near the dirac ( neutrality ) point .",
    "earlier the resonant scattering of dirac fermions was studied in a context of @xmath0-wave high - temperature superconductivity @xcite . for the case of graphene , vacancies are prototype examples of the resonant scatterers @xcite . numerous adatoms and admolecules ( including the important case of hydrogen atoms covalently bonded with carbon atoms ) provide other examples wehling2008,wehling2009,wehling2009b .",
    "recently , some experimental ni2010 and theoretical @xcite evidence appeared that , probably , the resonant scattering due to carbon - carbon bonds between organic admolecules and graphene is the main restricting factor for electron mobility in graphene on a substrate .",
    "resonant scattering also plays an important role in interatomic interactions and ordering of adatoms on graphene @xcite .",
    "this all makes the theoretical study of graphene with resonant scattering centers an important problem .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study this issue by direct numerical simulations of electrons on a honeycomb lattice in the framework of the tight - binding model .",
    "numerical calculations based on exact diagonalization can only treat samples with relative small number of sites , for example , to study the quasilocalization of eigenstate close to the neutrality point around the vacancy @xcite and the splitting of zero - energy landau levels in the presence of random nearest neighbor hoping @xcite . for large graphene sheet with millions of atoms , the numerical calculation of an important property , the density of states ( dos ) ,",
    "is mainly performed by the recursion method @xcite and time - evolution method @xcite .",
    "the time - evolution method is based on numerical solution of time - dependent schrdinger equation with additional averaging over random superposition of basis states . in this paper , we extend the method of ref . to compute the eigenvalue distribution of very large matrices to the calculation of transport coefficients .",
    "it allows us to carry out calculations for rather large systems , up to hundreds of millions of sites , with a computational effort that increases only linearly with the system size .",
    "furthermore , another extension of the time - evolution method yields the _ quasieigenstate _ , a random superposition of degenerate energy eigenstates , as well as the ac and dc  @xcite conductivities .",
    "the numerical calculation of the conductivity is based on the kubo formula of noninteracting electrons .",
    "the details of these algorithm will be given in this paper .",
    "our numerical results are consistent with the results on hydrogenated graphene  @xcite and graphene with vacancies  wu2010 , which are based on the numerical calculation of the kubo - greenwood formula  @xcite",
    ". another widely used method of the numerical study of electronic transport in graphene is the recursive green s function method cresti2007,lewenkopf2007,zhu2010,hilke2009,zhangyy2008,longw2008,zhangyy2009,zhangyy2009b , lherbier2008,mucciolo2009 , which is generally applied to relatively small samples followed by averaging of many different configurations .",
    "the recursive green s function method is a powerful tool to calculate the electronic transport in small system such as graphene ribbons , while the method that we employ in this paper is more suitable for large systems having millions of atoms and therefore does not involve averaging over different realizations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii gives a description of the tight - binding hamiltonian of single layer graphene including different types of disorders or impurities , in the absence and presence of a perpendicular magnetic field . in section iii ,",
    "we first discuss briefly the numerical method used to calculate the dos , and show the accuracy of this algorithm by comparing the analytical and numerical results for clean graphene .",
    "then , based on the calculation the dos , we discuss the effects of vacancies or resonant impurities to the electronic structure of graphene , including the broadening of the landau levels and the split of zero landau levels . in section iv",
    ", we introduce the concept of a _ quasieigenstates _ , and use it to show the quasilocalization of the states around the vacancies or resonant impurities .",
