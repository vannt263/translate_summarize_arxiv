    "the structure of the vacuum plays a key role in understanding physical phenomena .",
    "for example , qed and the asymptotic freedom phase of non - abelian gauge theory are based on the trivial vacuum @xmath0 and the physical vector fields , the transverse photon / gluon , are clearly exposed by using the coulomb gauge .",
    "confinement , on the other hand , is believed to be a non - perturbative vacuum phenomenon that is not yet clearly understood .",
    "presently , there are two confinement mechanisms discussed extensively in the literature .",
    "these are the magnetic monopoles@xcite and vortices@xcite , which are related to the maximal abelian gauge@xcite and maximal central gauge@xcite , respectively .",
    "although each of the two mechanism has its own set of successes and failures , they share an important shortcoming : they are disjointed from short - distance physics .",
    "as a quark is pulled from inside a hadron , it goes through the asymptotic phase ( short - distance , where transverse gluons are exchanged ) to the confinement phase ( large - distance , with mass gap and linearly rising interaction ) eventually resulting in hadronization . ideally then",
    ", the asymptotic phase and the confinement phase should continuously interpolate in a way where the effective degrees of freedom in each distance regimes are transparent . on the lattice",
    ", this problem is dealt with using a decimation procedure.@xcite for a number of years now , this author has been claiming that this is achieved in the continuum by using the non - linear gauge .",
    "the non - linear gauge@xcite , which is given by @xmath1 was proposed by the author eleven years ago because of the observation that field configurations that satisfy @xmath2 and equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) can not be gauge - transformed to the coulomb gauge .",
    "this follows from the fact that the zero mode of @xmath3 , which is @xmath4 , is also the source in the equation that solves for the gauge parameter . and",
    "conversely , field configurations on the coulomb surface can not be gauge transformed to the non - linear regime of equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) , i.e. , there is no @xmath5 such that @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "these mean that the two regimes of equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) , which are ( i ) the linear regime with @xmath9 , and ( ii ) the non - linear regime , which effectively is the gribov horizon of the surface @xmath10 , do not mix . thus , the coulomb gauge is an incomplete gauge - fixing for non - abelian theory , although there are claims to the contrary.@xcite    using the running of the coupling constant , the author argued that the non - linear gauge interpolates between short - distance ( perturbative ) physics and large - distance ( non - perturbative ) physics . in short - distance regime , where the coulomb gauge is in effect , the transverse gluons are the physical degrees of freedom .",
    "however , in the large - distance regime , the vector field @xmath11 and the scalar field @xmath12 , which satisfy two sets of constraints , are the effective degrees of freedom.@xcite the full quantum dynamics of the scalars lead to a parisi - sourlas mechanism@xcite with an @xmath13 symmetry@xcite , which unfortunately has a wrong sign for the kinetic term of the scalars .",
    "thus , although we have shown equivalence to a 2d o(1,3 ) non - linear sigma model , the proof of confinement remains formal because aside from the wrong sign of the scalar kinetic term , the mechanism is not identified and quarks and `` gluons '' are not involved .    to identify the mechanism",
    ", the author proposes that we look for ( a ) classical solution(s ) of the pure @xmath12 dynamics which is ( are ) vacuum configuration(s ) .",
    "we then expand on this ( these ) configuration(s ) and see the physics of quarks , `` gluons '' and scalar fluctuations around the background .",
    "this program was started by the author about five years ago and the following results had been derived .",
    "first , that all spherically symmetric functions @xmath14 , with @xmath15 , in @xmath16 are classical solutions with zero field strength.@xcite this shows that all the @xmath14 are vacuum configurations with zero action , which means the configuration space has a very broad minimum .",
    "second , since we do not have just one classical configuration but a whole class of solutions , the author proposed to treat them as a stochastic background with a white - noise distribution .",
    "this led to an area law behaviour for the wilson loop.@xcite thus , we have identified a possible mechanism for confinement .",
    "third , when we consider the classical dynamics of the `` gluons '' in the large distance regime , we find the gluons acquiring a mass.@xcite this verifies the existence of a mass gap .",
    "furthermore , the `` gluons '' also lose their self - interaction .",
    "this result was also arrived at by kondo by a suitable redefinition of fields.@xcite    in a forthcoming paper@xcite , which will provide the details of the results presented here and discuss quantum field theory in a stochastic background , the author will show that the scalars @xmath17 , which are fluctuations off the classical stochastic background @xmath14 , @xmath18 are non - propagating , i.e. , they do not have a kinetic term . as a matter of fact , we will show that @xmath19 is independent of the scalars @xmath20 and only dependent on @xmath11 .",
    "this resolves the problem of scalars with a wrong sign for the kinetic term encountered in the derivation of the parisi - sourlas mechanism , where the full quantum theory of the scalars was shown to be equivalent to a 2d o(1,3 ) non - linear @xmath21 model .    in this paper",
    ", we will present the quantum dynamics of quarks and `` gluons '' in a stochastic background , resulting mainly in the derivation of a non - local four - fermi interaction with a linear potential .",

    "this follows from @xmath33 and the anti - symmetry of @xmath34 with respect to b and c. thus , we are dealing with a whole class of classical solutions with zero field strength .",

    "since the scalar fluctuations @xmath20 where neglected , the gluons satisfied the constraint @xmath49 , instead of equation  [ eq:20 ] , thus resulting in an inconsistent massive but transverse gluons in reference  @xcite .",

    "it is found in @xmath83 we will evaluate the stochastic average by making use of @xmath84    from equation ( [ eq:46 ] ) , we must have @xmath85 where @xmath15 and @xmath86 . equation ( [ eq:47 ] )",

    "when we determined the correlation @xmath100 to arrive at the linear term ( note there are extra terms ) , we made use of components of the vector field involving @xmath101 in a background @xmath14 .",
    "all these components are important for the following reasons : ( 1 ) as was shown in section ii , just considering @xmath11 alone after stochastic averaging , does not lead to a confining term .",
    "( 2 ) as for the @xmath20 alone , it has no kinetic term and if we integrate it out yields a constraint on the fermion fields , which under the assumption of spherical symmetry says the fermion field must vanish beyond @xmath36 ( see reference ( 18 ) ) .",
    "( 3 ) considering @xmath102 alone will not do either because @xmath103 , if we neglect @xmath20 and @xmath11 , and we needed the @xmath104 at the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq:46 ] ) to derive equation ( [ eq:48 ] ) .",
    "thus , a certain combination of @xmath101 in @xmath14 is key in deriving the confining non - local four - fermi term .",
    "determining which components these are is difficult from a direct evaluation because there are many terms that contribute to it .",
    "the linear term appears but an unusual``renormalization '' , to get rid of a @xmath105 term with @xmath106 , must be carried out .",
    "thus , the derivation made use of equation ( [ eq:46 ] ) where , the divergence does not show up .",
    "in this paper , we showed confinement even with dynamical quarks .",
    "the confinement mechanism is the stochastic treatment of the scalar classical configurations @xmath14 , which arise in the non - linear regime of the non - linear gauge .",
