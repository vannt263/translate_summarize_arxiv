    "the detection of redshifted 21 cm signals from the early universe is attracting many attentions in the study of cosmology , because it provides a window to probe the baryonic gas and the first generation of light sources in the cosmic dark ages ( e.g. furlanetto et al .",
    "observational projects of highly sensitive meter radio telescopes , such as the low frequency array ( lofar ) ( rottgering 2003 ) , the square kilometer array ( ska ) ( van de weygaert & van albada 1996 ) , the mileura widefield array ( mwa ) and the 21 cm array ( 21cma ) ( pen et al .",
    "2004 ) , are ongoing or being planned .",
    "a major challenge to detect the primordial 21 cm signals is from the contamination of radio signals of the foreground .",
    "the brightness temperature fluctuations of the 21 cm signals would be seriously contaminated by high - redshift radio point sources , free - free emissions of the igm , and the noises from the artificial radio interference in the vhf band ( di matteo et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ; oh & mack 2003 ) .",
    "the power spectrum of the brightness temperature fluctuations of the redshifted 21 cm map may even be dominated by the fluctuations of the foreground ( di matteo et al .",
    "thus , we should search for useful features of the primordial 21 signals to distinguish it from the noisy foreground .",
    "for instance , the patchy structures of the 21 cm brightness temperature field are found to be highly non - gaussian , which would be helpful to identify the 21 cm signals from the noisy foreground ( he et al .",
    "2004 , mellema et al .",
    ". moreover , the correlation between the 21 cm signals and other emissions of the sources would also be useful for identifying high redshift sources .",
    "in this context , some studies focused on the 21 cm signals from individual uv ionizing sources in the reionization epoch .",
    "their features may provide a direct identification of the ionized patches of the reionization ( e.g. , tozzi et al . 2000 ) .",
    "very recently , the 21 cm emission and absorption around isolated ionizing sources has been calculated ( chuzhoy et al .",
    "2006 ; cen 2006 ; chen & miralda - escude 2006 ) . however , their results , especially the time - dependence of the profile of the 21 cm emission and absorption , still do not quite agree with each other .",
    "this problem comes partially from the fact that they dropped the time derivative term of the radiative transfer equation , i.e. , the speed of light is taken to be infinite",
    ". this approximation would be reasonable if the retardation effect is negligible .",
    "however , it is not the case for the 21 cm problem , for which we note that the size of the hii regions and the age of the sources used in these calculations have already been close to , or even violated , the retardation constraint @xmath9 . the retardation effect , or the effect of finite velocity of light , is not trivial . the time and space dependencies of the ionized and heated regions are substantially affected by the retardation effect ( white et al . 2003 ;",
    "shapiro et al . 2006a ; qiu et al 2007 ) .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to re - investigate this problem by fully considering the kinetics of photons in the phase space .",
    "we will use the weno algorithm for the radiative transfer calculation , which has been developed by qiu et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "the weno algorithm has been shown to have high order of accuracy and good convergence in capturing discontinuities and complicated structures ( shu 2003 ) .",
    "the weno algorithm is able to incorporate the temperature and species equations and to provide stable and robust solutions .",
    "it is also able to calculate the fractions of neutral hydrogen and helium within the ionized spheres , which generally are extremely small , but would be important to understand the possible correlation of the 21 cm and ly@xmath10 signals .    in  2 we present the ionization and temperature profiles of the igm around a uv ionizing source .",
    " 3 shows the 21 cm emission and absorption regions , and their dependency on intensities , frequency - spectrum and life time of the uv photon sources .",
    "discussions and conclusions are presented in  4 .",
    "the algorithm is summarized in the appendix .",
    "the whole process of reionization is very complex due to the inhomogeneous and clustering nature of the structure formation ( e.g. ricotti et al .",
    "2002 ; razoumov & norman 2002 ; ciardi et al .",
    "therefore , the configuration of the ionized regions generally would be non - spherical . however , in order to be comparable with previous studies ( chuzhoy et al . 2006 ; cen 2006 ; chen & miralda - escude 2006 ) , we will consider the ionization and heating of a uniform igm around a point source .",
    "this simplified model is reasonable to reveal the features of the formation and evolution of the 21 cm emission and absorption regions .",
    "the radiative transfer equation of the specific intensity @xmath11 is ( e.g. bernstein 1988 ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the photon frequency and @xmath14 is the hubble parameter at time @xmath15 .",
    "supposing the source is at the center @xmath16 , we have @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the energy of photons emitted from the central source per unit time within the frequency range from @xmath13 to @xmath19 . the source term can equivalently be described by a boundary condition as @xmath20 we will consider two kinds of frequency sepctrum : a power law spectrum @xmath21 with the total intensity ( energy per unit time ) @xmath22 and a blackbody spectrum .",
    "the effect of the expansion of the universe on the number density is negligible if the time scale concerned is a few myr at the epoch @xmath23 .",
    "however , the effect of the redshift of the photon energy is essential to calculate the flux of ly@xmath10 photons ( cen 2006 )",
    ". therefore , we will keep the @xmath14 term on the right hand side of eq.(1 ) .    the absorption coefficient in eq.(1 )",
    "is given by @xmath24 and @xmath25 where @xmath26 runs over the components @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 are , respectively , the cross section of ionization and the number density of component @xmath26 .",
    "the number density @xmath32 is calculated by solving the species equations involving ionization and recombination processes .",
    "we use the on - the - spot approximation to take into account the effect of the diffusing photons and treat the coupling of h and he by the radiation of hei recombination continuum and bound - bound transitions following the method in osterbrock ( 1989 ) .",
    "the corresponding coefficients for the ionization and recombination processes are taken from fukugita & kawasaki ( 1994 ) and theuns et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "the igm is heated by the uv photons with a rate in unit erg @xmath33 s@xmath34 as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the threshold of frequency to ionize component @xmath26 .",
    "the fraction of photon - electron energy converted to heat @xmath37 depends on the free electron fraction @xmath38 and the photon frequency @xmath13 .",
    "we use the fitting formula of @xmath37 given by shull & van steenberg ( 1985 ) .",
    "the corresponding coefficients for radiative cooling processes are also taken from theuns et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "the algorithm of the numerical solution of the radiative transfer equation coupled with the temperature and species equations of hi , hei and heii are described in qiu et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "a fifth - order finite difference weno scheme and a third - order tvd runge - kutta time discretization are applied to the spatial and time derivative , respectively .",
    "a semi - implicit method is used for the temperature and species equations .",
    "the details and tests of the numerical algorithm are described in qiu et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2007 ) and we give a brief description of the algorithm in the appendix .",
    "we first calculate the profile of an ionized sphere around a point source at @xmath1 . as an example",
    ", we consider a source of a power law spectrum with @xmath39 erg s@xmath34 and a spctral index @xmath4 , which are the typical values of qsos at the euv band ( e.g. zheng et al .",
    "the initial ionization fraction of hydrogen and helium is set to be @xmath40 , which is the remaining ionization fraction after recombination , and the initial temperature of the baryonic gas is set to be 10 k. a @xmath41cdm cosmology model with @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is adopted .",
    "the profiles of the ionized sphere at time 0.575 , 1.15 , 1.725 , 2.3 and 3 myr are shown in figure 1 , in which @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "figure 1 shows that although the main ionization zones have steep eges ( i - front ) , there are still a small fraction of hydrogen and helium been ionized beyond the i - fronts .",
    "this ionization is produced by high energy photons which can effectively penetrate into the igm further than photons near the ionization thresholds .",
    "the fraction @xmath52 has a long tail before it approaches the initial value @xmath40 ; the fraction of heii shows a similar behavior as that of hii .",
    "the i - fronts of heii and heiii generally are different from that of hii , and the decrease of the fraction of heiii with @xmath53 is much faster than that of hii and heii .",
    "we define the i - front @xmath54 as the location where @xmath55 .",
    "the speed of the i - front @xmath56 is plotted as the solid line in figure 2 .",
    "it shows that the evolution of the ionized sphere has two phases separated by a characteristic time @xmath57 . in the first phase @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and in the second phase @xmath60 , the speed decreases with @xmath15 in a power law , @xmath61",
    "this feature of two phases was first pointed out by white et al .",
    "( 2003 ) with an approximate solution by neglecting recombinations .",
    "this feature is actually not sensitive to the choice of the number @xmath40 ; if we take @xmath62 , the two phases feature still holds ( qiu et al .",
    "2007 ) .    within the i - front",
    ", @xmath63 is on the order of @xmath64 and corresponds to a column density of the order of 10@xmath65 @xmath66 on a physical length scale of the order of 100 kpc .",
    "this value of column density is just of the same order as the weak ly@xmath10 absorptions ( bi & davidsen 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , the ionized sphere is not completely gunn - peterson transparent , but may produce ly@xmath10 absorption features on the spectra of background sources . on the other hand , within the ionization front , @xmath67 , and",
    "therefore , the gunn - peterson optical depth of heii ly@xmath10 is larger than that of hi .",
    "it leads to significant fluctuations of the ratio between the two optical depths ( e.g. shull et al . 2004",
    "; liu et al . 2006 ) .",
    "we also calculate the ionized sphere of sources with intensities @xmath68 and @xmath69 erg s@xmath34 and a power law index @xmath4 .",
    "their i - front speeds are also plotted in figure 2 .",
    "it shows that all the three curves of @xmath70 have the two phases . especially , in the second phase the power law @xmath71 is approximately scaled with respect to @xmath72 , in other words , the characteristic time @xmath73 .",
    "this scaling can not be found with static solutions of the radiative transfer equation or by assuming the speed of light is infinite ( e.g. cen , apjs , 2002 ; whalen & norman 2006 ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the corresponding kinetic temperature distribution for the ionizing source with @xmath39 erg s@xmath34 and a power law index @xmath4 at time 0.575 , 1.15 , 1.725 , 2.3 and 3 myr .",
    "the kinetic temperature basically keeps constant around @xmath74 k within the ionized sphere , which is determined by the balance between the photon - ionization heating and radiative cooling .",
    "an interesting feature is that the temperature at the center ( @xmath75 ) is lower than the constant temperature .",
    "this is because the ionizing photon flux at the center is very strong , the number of @xmath63 at @xmath76 is extremely low ( see figure 1 ) , and therefore , the heating rate is low .",
    "figure 3 shows that the gas is also substantially heated beyond the i - front . actually , the energy spectrum of the radiation is significantly hardened around the i - front , because soft photons are effective to ionize the igm , and hard photons are more effective to heat the igm ( qiu et al 2007 ) . after the time @xmath57",
    ", soft photons are exhausted within the ionized sphere @xmath77 ; in contrast , hard photons are still abundant in the region @xmath78 , as hard photons can penetrate further beyond the ionized sphere .",
    "the region between the i - front and the front of light @xmath79 is a pre - heating layer .",
    "the temperature profile is different at different time and more elongated at a later time .",
    "this is because the speed of the i - front is much less than the speed of light after @xmath57 , while the spped of the front of heating is about the same as the speed of light .",
    "we introduce a radius @xmath80 by the solution of @xmath81 k , which is about the cmb temperature at @xmath1 .",
    "we call the high temperature region to be @xmath82 and the low temperature region @xmath83 . the latter will play the role of the 21 cm absorption .",
    "since the speed of the radius @xmath80 is also less than @xmath84 , the low temperature region increases quickly with time .",
    "therefore , the kinetic temperature distribution shows a long tail in the range @xmath85 k. we also calculate the kinetic temperature distribution of sources with intensities @xmath86 and @xmath69 erg s@xmath34 and a power law index @xmath4 .",
    "the profiles of the temperature distribution is substantially @xmath87-dependent .",
    "the 21 cm ( @xmath88 1420 mhz ) line emission or absorption associated with the spin - flip transition of the electron in neutral hydrogen is significant if the number density @xmath89 of neutral hydrogen is high and the spin temperature @xmath90 , which describes the number ratio between the spin - up and the spin - down states , deviates from the temperature of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xmath91 .",
    "the preheating region discussed in  2.3 , i.e. , the region between the i - front and the front of light @xmath79 , would satisfy these two conditions .",
    "we may call this region as a 21 cm shell .",
    "we do not consider the bulk motion of the baryonic fluid .",
    "thus , when @xmath90 is much larger than the hydrogen hyperfine energy @xmath92 k , the optical depth of the 21 cm absorption @xmath93 is given by ( wild 1952 ; field 1959 ) @xmath94 ( 1+z)^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath95 , the observed brightness temperature excess ( or deficit ) for the mean gas density of the universe at the redshifted frequency @xmath96 is @xmath97 ( 1+z)^{1/2 }       \\hspace{3 mm } { \\rm k}.\\ ] ]    the decoupling of the spin temperature @xmath90 from the cmb temperature @xmath91 could be achieved by the collision of neutral hydrogen and scattering of ly@xmath10 photons , which is the wouthuysen - field mechanism ( wouthuysen 1952 ; field 1959 ) .",
    "the spin temperature @xmath90 is then given by a weighted average of the cmb temperature @xmath91 , the kinetic temperature @xmath98 , and the color temperature @xmath99 of background photons at ly@xmath10 frequency ( field 1958 , 1959 ) @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the ly@xmath10 photon coupling coefficient and @xmath102 is the collision coupling coefficient .    at redshift @xmath103 ,",
    "the collision coupling is only efficient in overdense regions ( e.g. furlanetto & loeb 2002 ; shapiro et al .",
    "2006b ) , and is negligible for cosmological mean densities . in the low density igm , the wouthuysen - field mechanism would play the major role to decouple @xmath90 from @xmath91 .",
    "the resonant scattering of ly@xmath10 photons by neutral hydrogen leads to that the color temperature of the radiation spectrum near ly@xmath10 frequency approaches the kinetic temperature of the baryonic gas . therefore ,",
    "if there are enough ly@xmath10 photons , we have @xmath104 . there are two important ways to contribute ly@xmath10 photons : one is from the continuum spectrum photons redshifted to ly@xmath10 frequency , which is governed by the @xmath14 term in eq.(1 ) . the other one is from the excitation of neutral hydrogen by high energy electrons , and we take the fitting formula of the fraction of excitation for high energy electrons from shull & van steenberg ( 1985 ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the profiles of the spin temperature @xmath90 and the brightness temperature @xmath105 for a point source with @xmath39 erg s@xmath34 and a power law index @xmath4 at time 0.575 , 1.15 , 1.725 , 2.3 and 3 myr .",
    "the spin temperature @xmath90 for @xmath106 k is set to be @xmath98 ; this will not affect our results since hi is highly ionized for @xmath106 k. in the 21 cm shell , i.e. , the region between the i - front and the front of light @xmath79 , the brightness temperature @xmath107 .",
    "in the early stage , when the speed of the i - front @xmath108 is close to the speed of light , there is no 21 cm shell .",
    "the 21 emission and absorption regions become broad when the difference between @xmath54 and @xmath79 is significant .",
    "figure 4 shows that the 21 cm layer always contains an emission region @xmath109 and an absorption region @xmath110 .",
    "the maximum brightness temperature in the emission region is @xmath111 mk , while the minimum temperature of the absorption region is @xmath112 mk .",
    "the absorption region grows faster than the emission region . before 1 myr",
    ", the emission region is comparable with the absorption region , but at 3 myr , the emission region is about 2 comoving mpc while the absorption region exceeds 10 comoving mpc .",
    "a prominent feature of the brightness temperature in figure 4 is that the absorption region has a sharp cut - off at the front of light @xmath79 .",
    "this comes from the fact that in our model the wouthuysen - field coupling is efficient within the entire range of the photon propagation ; consequently , in the region @xmath113 , the ly@xmath10 photons are abundant enough to lock @xmath90 with @xmath98 .",
    "these photons come from the redshifted photons originally in the energy range between ionization energy and ly@xmath10 line . in this case",
    ", the edge of the 21 cm absorption region is an indicator of the lifetime of the ionzing source .",
    "we also calculate the profiles of the spin temperature @xmath90 and the brightness temperature @xmath105 of sources with intensities @xmath68 and @xmath69 erg s@xmath34 and a power law index @xmath4 .",
    "the results are presented in figure 5 .",
    "comparing figures 4 and 5 , one can see that the maximum ( emission ) and minimum ( absorption ) of @xmath105 basically are independent of the source intensity , while the profile of the 21 cm brightness temperature and its evolution depend strongly on the intensity .",
    "this is because the heating processes are sensitive to the evolution of photons in the phase - space , which also can not be described by a static approach .",
    "figure 6 shows the ratio between the sizes of emission and absorption regions , which decreases with time , because the growth of the absorption region ( brightness temperature @xmath110 ) is faster than that of the emission region . for a source with @xmath114 erg s@xmath34 ,",
    "the size of the emission region is larger than that of the absorption region at an early stage @xmath115 myr , while for sources with @xmath116 and @xmath117 erg s@xmath34 , the size of the emission region is always smaller than that of the absorption region .",
    "figure 7 shows the profiles of the spin temperature @xmath90 and the brightness temperature @xmath105 for an ionizing source at @xmath1 with the spectral index @xmath118 and 4 .",
    "the intensities for both cases are normalized to be @xmath39 erg s@xmath34 , i.e. , the same as the source of  2.2 .",
    "comparing figures 3 and 7 , we see that the size of the 21 cm emission region of both @xmath118 and 4 is narrower than that of @xmath4 .",
    "this is due to the lack of high energy photons for heating .",
    "on the other hand , the absorption regions are more notable than that in the case of @xmath4 , as the sources of @xmath118 and 4 have stronger ly@xmath10 photon fluxes than @xmath4 .",
    "the lights from first galaxies may have a thermal spectrum .",
    "let us consider first galaxies consisting of stars with a blackbody spectrum and an effective temperature @xmath7 k , which corresponds to population iii stars with mass 200 - 500 m@xmath119 ( schaerer et al . 2002 ) .",
    "thermal radiation at temperature @xmath7 k does not contain many photons with energy larger than 100 ev .",
    "therefore , the pre - heating beyond the i - front is very weak , and the 21 cm region is small .",
    "figure 8 shows the spin temperature and the brightness temperature for a first galaxy with the same luminosity as the source for figure 4 .",
    "we see that the size of the 21 cm emission region of figure 8 is much narrower than that of figure 4 . however , the 21 cm absorption region is still significant , because the ly@xmath10 photons are still efficient to support the wouthuysen - field mechanism .",
    "we now consider a source which is the same as that used for figures 1 and 3 , but the source stops to emit photons after 3 myr .",
    "figure 9 shows the kinetic temperature @xmath98 , the spin temperature @xmath90 and the brightness temperature @xmath105 at time 3 , 3.45 , 4.03 and 4.60 myr .",
    "we see that the i - front and @xmath80 still move ahead in the period of 3 to 3.45 myr , but they slow down after 3.45 myr . it is simply due to the fact that there are no more photons to support ionization and heating .",
    "consequently , the 21 cm emission shell shrinks and almost disappears at 4.03 myr .",
    "an interesting result is that the 21 absorption region is alive even when @xmath120 myr , i.e. , 1.6 myr after the photon source has died out .",
    "this is once again due to the abundance of ly@xmath10 photons .",
    "when @xmath121 myr , no high energy photons can reach @xmath122 mpc , while the wouthuysen - field mechanism is working to the size @xmath79 .",
    "figure 9 shows that the absorption region at @xmath123 myr is limited within two sharp cut - offs : @xmath124 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath125 and @xmath126 , which is just the range given by the retardation of the first and last light signals from the source with a luminous lifetime of 3 myr .      while including the thermal broadening , eq.(5 )",
    "should be replaced by @xmath127 where the factor @xmath128 is the normalized doppler broadening line profile as @xmath129 with @xmath130 . for gas with temperature",
    "@xmath131 k , we have @xmath132 , and the comoving scale is thus @xmath133 . in the @xmath41cdm model at @xmath134 , we have @xmath135 h@xmath34 mpc .",
    "if the thickness of the 21 cm emission shell is less than @xmath136 , the doppler broadening will smooth out the 21 cm emission . as discussed in previous sections ,",
    "the 21 cm emission regions are narrow for weak sources and high spectral index .",
    "therefore , the 21 cm emission would not be observable for sources with @xmath87 much less than @xmath137 ergs s@xmath34 or @xmath138 ergs s@xmath34 , but @xmath139 .",
    "we have studied the formation and evolution of the ionized and heated region around a uv ionizing source in the reionization epoch . in the first stage ,",
    "the ionizing and heating fronts of the igm are coincident and propagate with a speed close to the speed of light .",
    "the evolution enters the second stage when the frequency spectrum of uv photons is hardened due to the loss of photons by reionization . in this stage ,",
    "the propagating speed of the i - front is less than the speed of light , but high energy photons and ly@xmath10 photons can still reach the front of light @xmath79 .",
    "the spherical shell between the i - front @xmath54 and @xmath79 is the region in which 21 cm signals are produced .",
    "the inner shell from @xmath54 to @xmath80 gives 21 cm emissions ; the outer shell from @xmath80 to @xmath79 produces 21 cm absorptions .",
    "both the 21 cm emission and absorption regions are sensitively dependent on the intensity , frequency - spectrum and life - time of the ionizing source .",
    "if the intensity is much less than @xmath140 ergs s@xmath34 and the spectral index @xmath141 is larger than 3 , the emission region is very narrow , and the signal will probably be smoothed out by thermal broadening . for sources with intensity",
    "@xmath142 ergs s@xmath34 and a spectral index @xmath143 , the comoving size @xmath144 is about 1 - 5 mpc .",
    "the brightness temperature excess upon the cmb is about 30 mk .",
    "therefore , it yields a radio signal near the band of 70 mhz and is resolvable with observations of angular resolution better than 0.5 arcmin and spectral resolution better than 40 khz .",
    "the 21 cm absorption region has very different behaviors from the emission regions .",
    "absorption region mainly depends on the coupling of the spin temperature and the kinetic temperature , which is efficient if there are enough ly@xmath10 photons .",
    "the ionizing source with a power law spectrum or thermal spectrum at @xmath145 can always provide enough ly@xmath10 photons until the largest distance @xmath79 .",
    "that is , the size of the absorption region directly measures the age of the source . for a source with lifetime @xmath146",
    ", the absorption region can survive even when @xmath15 is larger than @xmath146 . in this region , the brightness temperature deficit with respect to the cmb is of the order of a few ten mk .",
    "the comoving size of the absorption region can be as large as 10 - 20 mpc .",
    "moreover , the small fraction of hi and heii remained in the ionized sphere can lead to absorption features on the spectra of background sources .",
    "therefore , the correlated 21 cm emission , absorption and ly@xmath10 signals would be helpful to identify ionized patches in the early universe .",
    "although all the calculations of this paper are on spherical regions , many features revealed with the spherical profiles would also hold for non - spherical profiles .",
    "this is because many features of the formation and evolution of 21 cm signals depend only on the growth of the ionized and heated regions , but not on the details of their configuration .",
    "for instance , it can be shown that the growth of a non - spherical ionized region around clustered sources also consists of two phases as that shown in figure 2 . in the first phase , the speed of the i - front is also close to the speed of light , even though in these cases we can not use one ionized radius @xmath147 to describe the ionized region . moreover ,",
    "similar to the spherical ionized regions , the characteristic time @xmath57 is longer for clustered sources with higher intensity @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , the stronger the sources , the later the formation of the 21 cm regions .",
    "this property is regardless of the geometry of the clustered sources ( qiu et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) .    in our calculations , the dynamical behavior of cosmic baryonic gas",
    "is ignored .",
    "such an approximation would be reasonable when the speed of the sound wave are very different from the speed of the formation and evolution of the 21 cm emission regions .",
    "most features of the 21 cm emissions and absorptions should still hold when the hydrodynamics of the baryonic gas is taken into account .",
