    "a sequential generation of patterns by a system of oscillators is motivated by central pattern generators of biological neural networks @xcite .",
    "central pattern generators usually are considered in the context of neuroscience as an explanation of how nervous systems produce movements .",
    "they are autonomous neural networks that can endogenously produce rhythmically patterned output like breathing , walking , or heartbeat .",
    "apart from improving an understanding of the biological aspects , nowadays the engineering aspect of networks of oscillators plays a prominent role @xcite .",
    "for example , complex dynamical structures in populations of phase oscillators were engineered by means of nonlinear time - delayed feedback that is implemented in the interactions of the oscillators @xcite .    in this work",
    "we address the problem of generation of periodic sequences of patterns by a dynamical system of phase oscillators .",
    "we consider the case where a set of @xmath0 patterns @xmath1 should be presented periodically in a certain time order . to solve this problem",
    "we design a system which consists of a pacemaker , a retrieval network , and @xmath0 stored patterns between these elements .",
    "the proposed system can be seen as an associative memory driven by a pacemaker . here , we use a particular case of an associative memory ( retrieval network ) with time - dependent couplings controlled by the pacemaker through the patterns @xmath1 .",
    "associative memory models based on the use of phase oscillators are alternatives to the hopfield model @xcite with spins replaced by phase oscillators .",
    "these models are generalizations of the kuramoto model @xcite ( for a review see acebron @xcite ) .",
    "examples for such generalizations were considered by aoyagi @xcite and further improved by nishikawa _",
    "@xcite with the goal to achieve a storing capacity similar to that of the hopfield model along with error - free retrieval .    as a result ,",
    "our system is able to produce sequences of patterns in the retrieval network .",
    "these patterns are encoded as phase differences between the oscillators .",
    "the associated dynamical states correspond to phase - locked synchronization .",
    "such states amount to cluster partitions of the oscillators set , in which oscillators sharing the same phase are gathered in one cluster .",
    "the system can be seen as a stylized version of the central pattern generator of the leech heartbeat @xcite , that is composed of two sets , the rhythm generator ( corresponding to our pacemaker ) , and the pattern generator ( the retrieval network ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec1 ]",
    "we present the model for our device and its different building blocks . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we illustrate its performance and point on the analogy to a central pattern generator .",
    "the conclusions are drawn in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "the system is composed of a phase oscillator , which plays the role of pacemaker and is characterized by a phase variable @xmath2 , a retrieval network with @xmath3 globally coupled phase oscillators with phases @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath0 patterns @xmath1 stored in the couplings between the pacemaker and the retrieval network .",
    "the function of the pacemaker is to control the timing and activation of the stored patterns @xmath1 as a function of its phase . in this way",
    ", the pacemaker works as a clock that points to the pattern that should be activated in the sequence .",
    "the retrieval network encodes the stored patterns @xmath1 as phase differences between its @xmath3 phase oscillators , one by one as a function of time .",
    "we call it retrieval network since its function consists in retrieving the information stored in the couplings between the pacemaker and the network , and translating the patterns to the corresponding cluster partitions of the phase oscillators",
    ".    the operation of the retrieval network is achieved by designing a suitable energy function @xmath6 .",
    "the minima of this function are approached by a gradient dynamics in which the energy function plays the role of the potential .",
    "the minima correspond to specific cluster partitions , for which the phase differences take only values of zero or @xmath7 .",
    "these configurations are easily mapped to binary sequences . in the set of @xmath3 oscillators",
    "only @xmath8 phases are independent , therefore we can have @xmath9 cluster partitions .",
    "a pattern @xmath1 is then described as an @xmath8-dimensional vector with components @xmath10 being the phase differences between the oscillators @xmath11 and @xmath3 .",
    "now , in order to retrieve a selected pattern out of the @xmath12 ones that are in principle available , we implement couplings between the pacemaker and the phase oscillators which modulate the energy landscape in a way that the selected pattern becomes the only minimum at a given time .",
    "so the proposed system can be seen as an associative memory .",
    "the associative memory is particular in the sense that the couplings are time - dependent , driven and controlled by the pacemaker through the choice of patterns @xmath1 . for the selection of another pattern , another set of couplings",
    "is addressed by the pacemaker . this way it becomes possible to retrieve a whole temporal sequence .",
    "if the retrieval network had only static sets of couplings between the oscillators , several minima could coexist and would be reached by the gradient dynamics depending on their basins of attraction .",
    "this case corresponds to an associative memory network as proposed by aogagi @xcite and nishikawa _ et al .",
    "our aim is , however , different .",
    "we consider time - dependent couplings in order to have a time - dependent energy landscape that is controlled by the pacemaker .",
    "in addition , we impose the constraint that only one minimum of @xmath6 may exist at a time , when a pattern is selected by the pacemaker .",
    "the advantage then is that the gradient dynamics will lead to the required minimum starting from any initial condition due to the absence of competing basins of attraction .    in the following",
    "we shall describe the building blocks of our device in detail , before we illustrate how it works for retrieving a cyclic sequence of patterns .",
    "the dynamics of this network is characterized by an energy function @xmath6 ( `` l '' shall remind to its role as a lyapunov function ) whose gradient determines the phase evolution of the oscillators . in general",
    ", the system evolves to the different minima of @xmath6 depending on the initial condition and on the basis of attraction of each minimum . for this retrieval network",
    "we use a particular version of the model proposed by nishikawa _",
    "we shall show how we tune the couplings in order to have only one minimum in @xmath6 when a pattern is selected for retrieval .",
    "the function @xmath6 then depends on @xmath3 oscillator phases @xmath13 in the following way : @xmath14 with @xmath15 the phase variables and @xmath16 the coupling strength that finally determines the speed of convergence of the dynamics towards the stationary state , see eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] below .",
    "as noted before , out of the maximally @xmath17 different phase differences , only @xmath8 are independent , so we choose @xmath18 , @xmath19 as independent variables , using the phase of the @xmath3th oscillator as reference . with @xmath20 we denote the couplings , @xmath21 .    for vanishing couplings @xmath20",
    "we get back the kuramoto model with twice the usual frequency in the interaction between the oscillators .",
    "then , @xmath6 has obviously @xmath9 minima given by the vectors @xmath22 of equal height with components @xmath23 @xmath24 . in the configuration space of phase differences",
    "@xmath25 , these minima are located at the corners of a hypercube of linear size @xmath7 with one corner in the origin of coordinates .",
    "it is these @xmath9 local minima that are our candidates for retrieval .",
    "the label @xmath26 of the state @xmath27 is determined by the pattern of @xmath28s and @xmath7s interpreted as binary sequence in decimal representation .    in general , the @xmath20 are couplings appropriately chosen to modulate the energy function @xmath6 in order to retrieve a selected pattern @xmath29 .",
    "a sufficient condition for a local minimum reads that the hessian matrix of @xmath6 is positive definite , i.e. , all eigenvalues being larger than zero , due to an appropriate choice of @xmath20 .",
    "now let us select one pattern @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "let the couplings modulate the interaction between oscillator pairs @xmath31 according to @xmath32 for @xmath33 with @xmath34 , @xmath35 any real number with @xmath36 and @xmath37 the index of the selected pattern .",
    "so the couplings @xmath20 take values of @xmath38 , depending on the pattern .",
    "this choice is guided by the postulate that the selected configuration remains the only local minimum when these couplings are applied , while all other former local minima become saddles in at least one direction or local maxima .",
    "the conjecture is that a choice according to eq.[eq4 ] satisfies this postulate . in the appendix",
    "we shall show that for this choice of couplings the hessian is positive definite for each configuration that is selected from the @xmath9 patterns , and not positive definite for all other @xmath39 configurations , which were formerly also minima for vanishing couplings .",
    "( for @xmath40 it can be shown that all local minima remain stable , but the selected one becomes the deepest . )",
    "the gradient dynamics will then retrieve the local minimum from any initial condition , not necessarily close to the selected minimum .",
    "it should be noticed that the choice of couplings @xmath20 for a selected pattern @xmath1 by eq .",
    "[ eq4 ] can be mapped to the hebbian rule in the particular case where only one pattern is memorized by the associative memory of nishikawa _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . however , this restriction to the case of only one minimum of the energy function ( ensured by the choice of @xmath36 ) has the advantage that it leads to an error - free retrieval starting from an arbitrary initial condition , possibly far away from the final configuration .",
    "explicitly the gradient dynamics of the oscillators then reads : @xmath41    similarly to the kuramoto dynamics the interaction of the oscillators depends only on phase differences @xmath42 , and due to the choice of trigonometric functions the interaction terms are bounded as in the kuramoto dynamics .",
    "due to the gradient dynamics the phase differences will evolve to a fixed point which is the minimum of the energy function @xmath6 that is closest to the initial conditions .",
    "note that the second order fourier term was related to the formation of clusters by mato @xcite . in our case",
    ", this term appears due to the very construction of the energy function .",
    "we extend our dynamics to sequential pattern retrieval via time dependent couplings controlled by a pacemaker .",
    "the pacemaker is a phase oscillator with constant frequency @xmath43 and phase @xmath2 , whose time derivative is given by @xmath44    it is the phase @xmath2 that selects and activates a pattern @xmath45 among the @xmath0 stored ones over a duration @xmath46 .",
    "this activation period lies in the phase ( time ) interval between @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "for simplicity we have chosen @xmath49 for all @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "this means , when the instantaneous phase @xmath2 comes to the value @xmath52 , couplings @xmath20 are switched on that guarantee the retrieval of the pattern @xmath53 . here",
    "the pre - superscript @xmath45 indicates the label of the pattern within the time sequence , the post - superscript @xmath54 stands for the decimal label of the pattern @xmath45 out of the selected subset .",
    "the corresponding dynamical equations read : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57    here @xmath58 denotes the heavyside function .",
    "this means that the function @xmath59 controls the couplings to be given as @xmath60 over the phase interval @xmath46 , starting from @xmath61 on .",
    "obviously we should ensure that @xmath62 , that is , the time interval between two initiations of pattern retrievals and the time of application of the constant couplings ( to reach the new pattern ) should be larger than the transient time @xmath63 which the retrieval network needs to go from one pattern to the next ( the speed of the internal dynamics is controlled by @xmath16 ) .",
    "the information for the sequence generation is stored in the phase values @xmath52 s through the functions @xmath59 which ",
    "switch on \" the appropriate couplings . since the stored patterns @xmath1 are required at different times , they must be stored outside the retrieval network .",
    "therefore we say that the patterns generated in the sequence are memorized in the couplings between the pacemaker and the retrieval network . this way the architecture can modulate the couplings @xmath20 between the oscillators of the retrieval network .    in summary ,",
    "the pacemaker transforms the static contents , memorized in the couplings , into a temporal sequence of patterns , a feature that is in common with a central pattern generator .    to complete our set of equations",
    ", we have to introduce noise in the retrieval dynamics .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "as we have seen , once a pattern is selected for retrieval , the system evolves according to the dynamics of eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] to the only stable fixed point of @xmath6 of the retrieval network .",
    "when the next pattern of the sequence is activated by the pacemaker , the system is still in the former fixed point that turns into an unstable one . to kick the system out of this fixed point and follow the required sequence",
    ", we apply gaussian white noise of small intensity t. eq.[eq2 ] is then replaced by    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is a random variable describing the white noise with zero mean , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 is the noise intensity .",
    "our system is then described by eq.s [ equ_clock ] , [ equ_oscillators_noise ] , [ couplings_psi ] , and [ g ] .",
    "in this section we study an example of this system and focus on its dynamical properties .",
    "we integrate the dynamics using a second order stochastic runge - kutta method@xcite with time step @xmath68 and noise intensity @xmath69 .",
    "we consider a set of @xmath70 phase oscillators in the retrieval network .",
    "this network can therefore encode @xmath71 patterns as cluster partitions . out of this set",
    ", we have randomly selected @xmath72 patterns .",
    "they are @xmath73 , @xmath74,@xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 in the indicated order . the time dependent - couplings are changed at phase values @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",

    "@xmath6 jumps from its minimal value at @xmath84 to some larger value around @xmath85 , where it remains as long as the system of oscillators searches the new minimum , corresponding to the new choice of external fields .",
    "when the new minimum is found , @xmath6 drops to the minimal value again .",
    "during such an interval of duration @xmath46 , the euclidean distance @xmath86 in configuration space between the actual state and the closest pattern ( corner of the hypercube ) has a peak at an intermediate time interval where the system is moving from one to the next selected state .",

    "the width of the peaks in the distance from the closest states can be tuned by the coupling parameter @xmath16 , large @xmath16 accelerates the convergence to a new pattern , once the time - dependent couplings are changed ; also the strength of the couplings , parameterized by @xmath35 , determines the speed of convergence .",

    "next let us consider the hessian of @xmath6 as function of the phase differences .",
    "apart from the normalization factor , its diagonal elements are given as : @xmath114 its off - diagonal elements are : @xmath115 for a choice of the external fields @xmath20 according to the rule ( [ eq4 ] ) , the matrix simplifies to @xmath116 for the diagonal elements and @xmath117 , and to @xmath118 for the off - diagonal elements , with @xmath119 .",

    "next we study the positive definiteness of this matrix for all @xmath9 configurations which may be selected for retrieval . here",
    "it is convenient to classify the configurations in terms of their hamming distance from the selected pattern , i.e. the number of mismatches of components between @xmath123 and @xmath124 , which varies between zero and @xmath8 . by a suitable permutation of the coordinate axis in configuration space",
