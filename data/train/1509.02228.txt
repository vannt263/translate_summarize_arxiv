    "currently emerging technologies open up opportunities to synthesize artificial optical media known as quantum metamaterials ; see , for example , @xcite . these large - scale quantum networks with are engineered from complex unit cells and are effectively homogeneous ( in the sense of translational symmetries ) on the scale of relevant wavelengths , for example , in the microwave range . in natural solids , the quantum energy level configurations of the constituent atoms or molecules specifies the optical behaviour of the material .",
    "in contrast , the controllable resonant characteristics of the building elements of quantum metamaterials , such as the josephson devices or optical cavities @xcite , determine the electromagnetic response of the quantum metamaterials .",
    "the quantum metamaterials are considered to be a promising approach to the implementation of quantum computer elements which can maintain quantum coherence over many cycles of their internal evolution @xcite .",
    "a framework for modelling and analysis of a wide range of open quantum systems , including those arising in quantum metamaterials , is provided by quantum stochastic differential equations ( qsdes ) @xcite . in qsdes , the environment is modelled as a heat bath of external fields acting on a boson fock space @xcite . in particular ,",
    "linear qsdes represent the heisenberg evolution of pairs of conjugate operators in a multi - mode open quantum harmonic oscillator which is coupled to the external bosonic fields .",
    "this framework also allows for robust stability analysis for certain classes of perturbed open quantum systems which have been addressed , for example , in @xcite .",
    "the analysis of large - scale quantum networks can be effectively reduced in the case when they are organized as a translation invariant interconnection of identical elements with periodic boundary conditions ( pbcs ) ; see , for example , @xcite .",

    "coherent quantum feedback control is aimed at achieving robust stability and robust performance through measurement - free interconnection of quantum systems @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the controller is another quantum system which is coupled to the quantum plant , for example , through a bilateral energy interconnection , known as direct coupling @xcite . in comparison with the more traditional measurement - based feedback control techniques , coherent control benefits from the preservation of quantum coherence within the network . in this paper , both the quantum plant and the coherent quantum controller are modelled as large fragments of translation invariant networks of linear quantum stochastic systems endowed with the pbcs .",
    "the nodes of the networks are directly coupled to each other within a finite interaction range .",
    "this interconnection is governed by linear qsdes based on the hamiltonian and coupling parametrization of the corresponding multi - mode open quantum harmonic oscillator whose dynamic variables satisfy the canonical commutation relations ( ccrs ) .",
    "following a similar approach used in the classical control theory , we employ spatial fourier transforms in order to obtain a more tractable representation of the dynamics of the quantum feedback network ; see , for example , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "we consider a weighted mean square performance index for the stable plant - controller network in the thermodynamic limit ( when the network size goes to infinity ) . in this framework ,",
    "the decentralized control design problem is formulated as the minimization of the cost functional over the parameters of the controller and its coupling with the plant . by calculating the fr ' echet derivatives of the cost functional , we obtain first - order necessary conditions for optimality of the controller . in comparison with previous results on coherent quantum lqg control @xcite using gramians and related algebraic lyapunov equations ( ales ) ,",
