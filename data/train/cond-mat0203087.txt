    "a spin triplet superconductor should show a number of interesting magnetic - field effects which are direct consequences of the magnetic moment of the cooper pairs .",
    "in particular , for spin - triplet superconductors the zeeman coupling between the quasiparticle spins an external magnetic field need not lead to pauli limiting , unlike the case of spin - singlet superconductors . in the extreme high field limit with completely exchange - split bands",
    "we could expect single spin pairing of the majority spin fermi surface .",
    "we may also expect possible phase transitions or symmetry changes of the order parameter in a magnetic field , which are analogous to the transitions seen in superfluid @xmath2he@xcite .",
    "the @xmath2he b - phase is destroyed in a magnetic field in a qualitatively similar manner to a singlet superconductor . on the other hand ,",
    "if the zero field ground state is one of equal - spin - pairing ( esp ) , then the gap function can deform continuously as a function of a zeeman field the @xmath2he a - phase evolves first smoothly into a@xmath0 phase and then , via a phase transition a@xmath3 phase , as it progresses from equal - spin - pairing to single spin pairing with increasing field@xcite .",
    "the superconductor sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 should be an ideal candidate to examine these effects .",
    "there is strong evidence for spin - triplet pairing@xcite from direct measurements of spin - susceptibility in the superconducting state@xcite .",
    "it is has a simple and well understood fermi surface@xcite , and is in the clean limit .",
    "the detailed gap function is still somewhat controversial , but is generally believed@xcite to be of tetragonal @xmath4 symmetry@xcite , and more specifically to be a two - dimensional analogue of the @xmath2he a - phase , with @xmath5 .",
    "this order parameter would agree with the spin - susceptibility measurements in the superconducting state@xcite , and also would lead to time - reversal symmetry breaking below @xmath6@xcite .",
    "more recently , specific heat@xcite , penetration depth@xcite and thermal conductivity@xcite experiments have shown that the gap must have line - nodes on the fermi surface . however , for the cylindrical fermi surface geometry@xcite of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 a complete group theoretic analysis of symmetry distinct pairing states does not show any which both break time - reversal symmetry and have line - nodes@xcite .",
    "a possible resolution to this dilemma has been developed in the orbital dependent pairing model of zhitomirsky and rice@xcite and a in related model by litak    et al    .",
    "@xcite . for different reasons both groups proposed that the gap function is of the form @xmath7 on the dominant @xmath8-fermi surface sheet , and of the form @xmath9 on the @xmath10 and @xmath11 sheets .",
    "both of these functions possess the same @xmath4 symmetry , but correspond to intra - plane and inter - plane pairing interactions respectively .",
    "this gap function has horizontal line nodes at @xmath12 on the @xmath10 and @xmath11 sheets , and was shown to be in good agreement with experimental temperature dependences for specific heat , penetration depth and thermal conductivity@xcite .    in a magnetic field sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1",
    "shows a number of unusual features .",
    "firstly the vortex lattice is square@xcite which agrees well with the predictions of a two - component @xmath4 symmetry ginzburg - landau theory@xcite .",
    "secondly there is an anomalous second feature close to @xmath13 , which only occurs when the field is aligned within @xmath14 of the a - b plane@xcite . at the present time",
    "the origin of this feature is uncertain .",
    "it may be a vortex lattice phase transition , or it may correspond to a change in pairing symmetry with field , perhaps analogous to the double superconducting transition in upt@xmath15@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will focus specifically on the unique effects of the cooper pair spin in a triplet superconductor .",
    "therefore we neglect the effects of the vector potential on the quasiparticles , and instead focus solely on the zeeman coupling of the quasiparticle spin to the magnetic field .",
    "we can justify this model by appealing to the strong stoner enhancement in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , and so the exchange field will be large .",
    "alternatively , our model may be appropriate for the ferromagnetic superconductor zrzn@xmath0@xcite .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "firstly we write a simple single - band model hamiltonian for @xmath16-wave pairing in the @xmath8-band of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "next we examine how a spin - only magnetic field enters the corresponding @xmath4 symmetry ginzburg - landau theory . in section 4 ,",
    "we present detailed numerical results for the field dependent energy gap , and specific heat for the two relevant cases of the exchange field either parallel or perpendicular to the @xmath17 order parameter .",
    "we show that the lower free energy state in analogous to the @xmath2he a@xmath0 phase . finally , in sec .",
    "5 we present our conclusions .",
    "we consider the effect of a spin - only magnetic field , @xmath18 , on an attractive , nearest neighbour , hubbard model .",
    "we use a one - band model , appropriate for the @xmath8 sheet of the sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 fermi surface .",
    "the set of interaction constants , @xmath19 describe attractions between electrons on sites @xmath20 and @xmath21 with spins @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the hamiltonian for this model is :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the hopping integral , @xmath26 is the site energy , @xmath27 are the usual annihilation ( creation ) operators and @xmath28 is the number operator .",
    "@xmath29 are the components of the vector of pauli matrices : @xmath30 by making the hartree - fock - gorkov approximation and taking a lattice fourier transform the following spin - generalised bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation can be derived from the above hamiltonian .    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the ( fourier transformed ) normal , spin independent part of the hamiltonian .",
    "the order parameters @xmath33 are determined self consistently by    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the lattice fourier transform of @xmath36 and @xmath37 is shorthand for the fermi function @xmath38 .",
    "it is natural to separate the spin - generalized bdg equation into triplet and singlet parts :    @xmath39    @xmath40 is the ( scalar ) singlet order parameter and @xmath41 is the ( vector ) triplet order parameter .",
    "the singlet order parameter is symmetric under spatial inversion while the triplet order parameter in anti - symmetric under spatial inversion .",
    "hence , the bdg equation can be rewritten as    @xmath42    @xmath43    if there is no superconductivity in the triplet channel we regain the standard result @xcite for the spectrum of a singlet superconductor in a spin only magnetic field :    @xmath44    by setting the singlet order parameter to zero we find that the equivalent result for a triplet superconductor is    @xmath45    where @xmath46 it should be noted that this does not assume a unitary order parameter . ] .",
    "it is a relatively straightforward process to calculate thermodynamic properties for a triplet superconductor .",
    "for example the specific heat is given by    @xmath47",
    "before considering numerical solutions of the self consistent bogoliubov  de gennes equations , we will examine the possible results by deriving a ginzburg  landau theory from our microscopic theory .",
    "consider a quasi  two dimensional system with two orbital degrees of freedom ( which we label x and y ) and three spin degrees of freedom ( labelled 1 , 2 and 3 . ) hence , instead of the familiar 3 by 3 order parameter of @xmath2he this system is described by the complex 2 by 3 matrix @xmath48 , which is related to the microscopic order parameter , @xmath41 , by    @xmath49    in zero field the free energy for a tetragonal crystal is given by@xcite    @xmath50    only the first five quartic terms ( @xmath51 ) are required to describe @xmath2he .",
    "the additional two terms here ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) appear because the rotational symmetry of the crystal is discrete , where as rotational symmetry is continuous in the fluid .",
    "gradient terms can also be calculated@xcite , but we will not make use of these here .",
    "to second order in @xmath48 the free energy in a finite magnetic field , @xmath54 , is    @xmath55    where ,    @xmath56    and @xmath57 are the matsubara frequencies .    thus to all orders in @xmath18    @xmath58    hence ,    @xmath59    where ,    @xmath60 \\left [ ( \\i\\omega_n + \\varepsilon_{\\vec{k } } - \\mu)^2 - |\\vec{h}|^2 \\right ] } \\right ) .",

    "some algebra then leads to    @xmath62    where ,    @xmath63 \\left [ ( \\i\\omega_n + \\varepsilon_{\\vec{k } } - \\mu)^2 - |\\vec{h}|^2 \\right ] } , \\\\",

    "landau expansion .",
    "it is interesting to note the similarity of these extra terms to the change in the hartree  fock ",
    "gorkov quasiparticle spectrum caused by the magnetic field - ( [ spectrum ] ) .",
    "the cross product of any complex vector with its complex conjugate is purely imaginary .",
    "it is trivial to show that @xmath68 . ]",
    "so the square root of minus one before the @xmath66 term in the expression for the free energy is to be expected .",
    "as we have expanded in @xmath48 but not in @xmath18 the above expression for the free energy is valid for small gaps at all field strengths .",
    "it is therefore valid close to @xmath69 .",
    "but , note that , since we assumed an exchange - only magnetic field we do not consider the vortex lattice here .",
    "agterberg and heeb@xcite have discussed the vortex lattice using ginzburg  landau theory , but did not include the zeeman terms of ( [ zeeman_terms ] ) .    in the ginzburg ",
    "landau formalism the superconducting phase transition occurs when the quadratic terms go to zero . in a zero field",
    "this condition is simply    @xmath70    in a finite spin only magnetic field the equivalent condition is that the matrix    @xmath71    has ( at least ) one zero eigenvalue , but no negative eigenvalues , where the indices @xmath20 and @xmath21 run over both orbital and spin degrees of freedom . in this case",
    "@xmath72    where , @xmath73 the condition for there being a zero eigenvalue of @xmath74 is    @xmath75    this expression can be greatly simplified by choosing our coordinate system so that @xmath18 lies parallel to one of the axes . with , for example , @xmath76",
    "we find    @xmath77    which has at least one zero eigenvalue when    @xmath78    the eigenvectors of @xmath74 are    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is real .",
    "to second order in @xmath48 , @xmath80 is given by    @xmath81    much recent work ( see introduction ) has suggested that sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is likely to be in an state analogous to the a - phase of @xmath2he .",
    "if the pairing interaction favours the a - phase in zero magnetic field there are three possible solutions in a magnetic field .",
    "@xmath82    equation [ eqn : a - phase ] is the a - phase with @xmath41 parallel to @xmath18 .",
    "equations [ eqn : a1-phasea ] and [ eqn : a1-phaseb ] both give the a@xmath0-phase for @xmath83 and the a@xmath3-phase for @xmath84 .",
    "analogy may be drawn to the description of elliptically polarised light in optics@xcite .",
    "one can think of the three a - like phases as being described by an ellipse of eccentricity @xmath85 .",
    "the a - phase is the special case of linear polarization when the ellipse reduces to a line parallel to @xmath41 .",
    "the a@xmath3 phase is the special case of circularly polarized light a circle which lies in the 1,2-plane .",
    "the a@xmath0 corresponds to any ellipse between these two extremes . in the a@xmath3 and a@xmath0-phases by taking the appropriate superposition of ( [ eqn : a1-phasea ] ) and ( [ eqn : a1-phaseb ] ) the major axis of the ellipse can be made to point in any direction in the plane perpendicular to @xmath18 .",
    "to progress further we must resort to solving the self consistent bogoliubov ",
    "de gennes equations numerically . to do this we fit the hopping integral and site energy to the experimentally determined fermi surface of the @xmath8-sheet of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the interaction potential is restricted to include nearest neighbour terms only and chosen to give the experimentally observed critical temperature ( 1.5k ) .",
    "we begin by studying the first solution of the ginzburg  landau theory ( [ eqn : a_para_phase ] ) , in which @xmath41 is parallel to @xmath18 . in zero field",
    "we find that the ground state of the model is a triplet state analogous to the a - phase of @xmath2he , specifically the state is    @xmath86    here we have defined the vector order parameter to point in the @xmath87 direction . in zero field ,",
    "all directions in spin space are degenerate if spin ",
    "orbit coupling is neglected .",
    "when an external field is applied the ground state has @xmath41 perpendicular to the field , as we will show below .",
    "however , in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 the order parameter is thought to be aligned with the c - axis@xcite , by spin - orbit coupling .",
    "therefore despite the low critical field along the c - axis , sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 presents us with the possibility of studying a triplet superconductor with a magnetic field parallel to the order parameter .",
    "it is therefore interesting to predict what would be observed in such experiments . to do this we simply discard any a - phase like solutions with @xmath41 not parallel to @xmath18 .",
    "we then consider the remaining self consistent solution of the bdg equation with the lowest free energy .",
    "a field applied parallel to @xmath41 does not cause a change in the symmetry of the gap .",
    "it follows that at zero temperature the gap is independent of magnetic field strength ( see appendix ) . at finite temperature ,",
    "a field applied parallel to the order parameter causes a change in the magnitude of the gap ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : para_gap ] . )",
    "it should be noted that the gap is nodeless but has minima at @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "we calculate the heat capacity , magnetisation and magnetic susceptibility as functions of temperature and field strength . for an isotropic nodeless gap in zero field it is well known@xcite that these properties behave as @xmath90    we find that for an anisotropic , nodeless , p - wave gap the thermodynamics have the same form , even in the presence of a magnetic field ( see inset fig . [",
    "fig : para_deff ] ) we therefore define the effective gap , @xmath91 seen by the thermodynamic functions as    @xmath92    we find that @xmath91 is the mean gap at the fermi surface , @xmath93 in zero field and that @xmath91 is a linear function of magnetic field strength ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : para_deff ] . ) that is to say that    @xmath94      recall that the ground state of the model in zero field is    @xmath95    ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : perp_gap]a . )",
    "we will now examine the numerical solutions of the full bdg equations corresponding to the second solution of the ginzburg  landau theory ( [ eqn : a1-phasea ] ) and([eqn : a1-phaseb ] ) . in a magnetic field",
    "the ground state is when the vector order parameter points perpendicular to the field .",
    "there is also a change in the pairing state to a phase analogous to the a@xmath0-phase of @xmath2he , where    @xmath96    where @xmath80 is a real function of temperature and field strength ( fig .",
    "[ fig : perp_gap]b , c . )",
    "physically this corresponds to the majority of the spin 1 cooper pairs aligning themselves antiparallel to the magnetic field .    in @xmath2he as the field and temperature increase @xmath80 increases until @xmath97 .",
    "this is the a@xmath3 phase which is the ground state of @xmath2he near to @xmath98 in finite fields .",
    "the a@xmath3-phase has order parameter    @xmath99    and corresponds to single spin pairing with all of the cooper pairs aligning themselves with the magnetic field ( fig .",
    "[ fig : perp_gap]d . )",
    "however , even near @xmath98 and in large fields we do not find that the a@xmath3-phase is the ground state of our model .",
    "if such a transition does occur then it is certainly well above the experimentally observed upper critical field .",
    "this is in agreement with experiment as no a@xmath3-phase has been observed to date .    due to the nodeless gap in the a@xmath0 phase the specific heat has an exponential temperature dependence .",
    "hence we can calculate the effective gap for this field orientation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : perp_deff ] . )",
    "we find a linear field dependence in low fields but its dependence is much weaker than for @xmath41 parallel to @xmath18 and there is an upturn in large fields .",
    "there is known to be a qualitative change in heat capacity in this field orientation @xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen if these are related .",
    "we investigated the order parameter of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 in an exchange - only magnetic field . a ginzburg ",
    "landau symmetry analysis implied three possibilities : either a @xmath2he a@xmath3 or a@xmath0 phase with @xmath41 perpendicular to the magnetic field or a pure @xmath2he a phase with @xmath41 parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "we explored the exchange field dependence of the order parameter and energy gap in a one - band model of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "the numerical solutions showed no a@xmath3 phase for physically reasonable field strengths and that of the two remaining phases the a@xmath0 phase is lower in free energy .",
    "we did not include the effect of spin - orbit coupling which could change the ground state for particular orientations of the magnetic field ( particularly with @xmath18 parallel to the c - axis of the crystal . )",
    "we investigated the behaviour of the heat capacity as a function of both field and temperature for both of these solutions .",
    "we have shown that the variation of the exponential cutoff below @xmath98 as a function of @xmath18 is quantitatively and qualitatively different for these two phases .",
    "this makes heat capacity an excellent experimental probe of the symmetry state in a magnetic field .",
