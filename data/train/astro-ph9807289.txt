    "we are constructing a model which aims to reproduce self - consistently observational data of many kinds related to cosmic - ray ( cr ) origin and propagation : direct measurements of nuclei , electrons , positrons , antiprotons , gamma rays , and synchrotron radiation .",
    "these data provide many independent constraints on any model and our approach is able to take advantage of this since it must be consistent with all types of observation .    here",
    "we present our results on the evaluation of diffusion / convection and reacceleration models based on the @xmath0  and @xmath1  ratios , and set limits on the halo size .",
    "a re - evaluation of the halo size is desirable since new @xmath1  data are now available from ulysses ( connell 1998 ) with better statistics than previously .",

    "we take @xmath10 kpc .",
    "the range @xmath11 kpc is considered . for a given @xmath12 the diffusion coefficient as a function of momentum is determined by @xmath0  for the case of no reacceleration ; if reacceleration is assumed then the reacceleration strength ( related to the alfvn speed ) is constrained by the energy - dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "the spatial diffusion coefficient for the case of no reacceleration is taken as @xmath13 below rigidity @xmath14 , @xmath15 above rigidity @xmath14 .",
    "since the introduction of a sharp break in @xmath16 is an extremely contrived procedure which is adopted just to fit @xmath0  at all energies , we also consider the case @xmath17 ( no break ) .",
    "the convection velocity @xmath18 is assumed to increase linearly with distance from the plane .",
    "for the case with reacceleration , the spatial diffusion coefficient is @xmath19 with @xmath20 for all rigidities , and the momentum - space diffusion coefficient @xmath21 is related to @xmath16 ( using berezinskii 1990 and seo 1994 ) .",

    "the interstellar ratio and the ratio modulated to 500 mv is shown .",
    "we consider the cases of diffusion+convection and diffusion+reacceleration , since these are the minimum combinations which can reproduce the key observations .",
    "our basic conclusion is that the reacceleration models are more satisfactory in meeting the constraints provided by the data , reproducing the @xmath0  energy dependence without _ ad hoc _ variations in the diffusion coefficient ; further it is not possible to find any _ simple _ version of the diffusion / convection model which reproduces @xmath0  satisfactorily .",
    "figure  1a shows the diffusion+convection model without break , @xmath26 ; for each @xmath23 , the remaining parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath14 are adjusted to fit the data as well as possible .",
    "it is clear that a _ good _ fit is _ not _ possible ; the basic effect of convection is to reduce the variation of @xmath0  with energy , and although this improves the fit at low energies the characteristic peaked shape of the measured @xmath0  can not be reproduced .",
    "if we allow @xmath29 it can clearly be fitted , but the break has to be large and the procedure is _ ad hoc_.    figure  1b illustrates a diffusive reacceleration model and shows the effect on @xmath0  of varying @xmath25 ( @xmath30 km s@xmath24 ) for @xmath31 kpc .",
    "this shows how the initial form becomes modified to produce the characteristic peaked shape .",
    "reacceleration models thus lead naturally to the observed peaked form of @xmath0 , as pointed out by previous authors ( e.g. , letaw 1993 , seo 1994 , heinbach 1995 ) ; a value @xmath32 km s@xmath24 seems satisfactory .",

    "we conclude that in the absence of convection @xmath33 , and if convection is allowed the lower limit remains but no upper limit can be set . in the case @xmath34 km s@xmath24 kpc@xmath24 , this figure places upper limits on the convection parameter for each halo size .",
    "these limits are rather strict , and a finite wind velocity is only allowed in any case for @xmath35 kpc .",

    "figure  3 ( left panel ) shows the effect of halo size on the radial distribution of 3 gev cr protons , for the reacceleration model . for comparison",
    "we show the cr distribution deduced by model - fitting to egret gamma - ray data ( @xmath37 mev ) from strong ( 1996b ) , which is dominated by the @xmath38-decay component ; the analysis by hunter ( 1997 ) , based on a different approach , gives a similar result .",
    "the predicted cr distribution using the snr source function is too steep even for large halo sizes ; in fact the halo size has a relatively small effect on the distribution .",
    "other related distributions such as pulsars have an even steeper falloff . based on these results we have to conclude , in the context of the present models , that the distribution of sources is not that expected from the ( highly uncertain ) distribution of snr . in view of the difficulty of deriving the snr distribution this is perhaps not a serious shortcoming",
    "; if snr are indeed cr sources then it is possible that the gamma - ray analysis gives the best estimate of their galactic distribution .",
    "therefore , we have chosen a cr source distribution to fit the @xmath2-ray data after propagation ( figure  3 , right panel ) . the possibility of anisotropic diffusion ( preferentially in the radial direction ) has not yet been addressed in our models .      fig .",

    "[ fig4 ]    the positron fraction computed is in good agreement with the measured one between 1 and 10 gev , where the data are rather precise .",
    "our positron predictions from moskalenko ( 1998a ) have been compared with more recent absolute measurements in barwick ( 1998 ) and the agreement is good ; for the positrons this new comparison has the advantage of being independent of the electron spectrum ( see also moskalenko 1998b ) ."
