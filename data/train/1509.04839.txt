    "optimal insurance contract design is an important problem , manifested not only in theory but also in insurance and financial practices .",
    "the problem is to determine the optimal amount of compensation as a function of the loss ",
    "called indemnity  so as to maximize the insured s satisfaction , subject to the participation constraint of the insurer .    in the insurance literature ,",
    "most of the work assume that the insurer is risk neutral while the insured is a risk - averse expected utility ( eu ) maximizer ; see e.g. arrow ( 1963 ) , raviv ( 1979 ) , and gollier and schlesinger ( 1996 ) .",
    "in this case , the optimal contract is in general a deductible one that covers part of the loss in excess of a deductible level .",
    "however , the eu theory has received many criticisms , for it fails to explain numerous experimental observations and theoretical puzzles . in the context of insurance contracting",
    ", the classical eu - based models can not explain some behaviors in insurance demand such as that for small losses ( e.g. demand for warranties ) ; see a detailed discussion in bernard et al .",
    "( 2015 ) .    in order to overcome this drawback of the eu theory ,",
    "different measures of evaluating uncertain outcomes have been put forward to depict human behaviors . a notable",
    "one is the rank - dependent utility ( rdu ) proposed by quiggin ( 1982 ) , which consists of a concave utility function and an inverse-@xmath0 shaped probability weighting ( or distortion ) function . through the probability weighting",
    ", the rdu theory captures the common observation that people tend to exaggerate small probabilities of extremely good and bad outcomes . with the development of advanced mathematical tools ,",
    "the rdu preference has been applied to many areas of finance , including portfolio choice and option pricing . on the other hand , barseghyan et al .",
    "( 2013 ) use data on households insurance deductible decisions in auto and home insurance to demonstrate the relevance and importance of the probability weighting and suggest the possibility of generalizing their conclusions to other insurance choices .",
    "there have been also studies in the area of insurance contract design within the rdu framework ; see for example chateauneuf , dana and tallon ( 2000 ) , dana and scarsini ( 2007 ) , and carlier and dana ( 2008 ) . however , all these papers assume that the probability weighting function is convex .",
    "bernard et al .",
    "( 2015 ) are probably the first to study rdu - based insurance contracting with _",
    "inverse-@xmath0 shaped _ weighting functions , using the quantile formulation originally developed for portfolio choice ( jin and zhou 2008 , he and zhou 2011 ) .",
    "they derive optimal contracts that not only insure large losses above a deductible level but also cover small ones .",
    "however , their contracts suffer from a severe problem of moral hazard , since they are not increasing with respect to the losses .",
    "is increasing if @xmath1 whenever @xmath2 .",
    "we say @xmath3 is `` strictly increasing '' if @xmath4 whenever @xmath2 .",
    "similar conventions are used for `` decreasing '' and `` strictly decreasing '' functions . ] as a consequence , insureds may be motivated to hide their true losses in order to obtain additional compensations ; see a discussion on pp .",
    "175176 of bernard et al . (",
    "2015 ) .",
    "this paper aims to address this setback .",
    "we consider the same insurance model as in bernard et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , but adding an explicit constraint that both the indemnity function and the insured s retention function ( i.e. the part of the losses to be born by the insured ) must be globally increasing with respect to the losses .",
    "this constraint will rule out completely the aforementioned behaviour of moral hazard ; yet mathematically it gives rise to substantial difficulty .",
    "the approach used in bernard et al .",
    "( 2015 ) no longer works .",
    "we develop a general approach to overcome this difficulty .",
    "specifically , we first derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for optimal solutions via calculus of variations .",
    "then we deduce explicitly expressed optimal contracts by a fine analysis on these conditions .",
    "an interesting finding is that , for a good and reasonable range of parameters specifications , there are only two types of optima contracts , one being the classical deductible one and the other a  three - fold \" one covering both small and large losses .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 presents the optimal insurance model under the rdu framework including its quantile formulation .",
    "section 3 applies the calculus of variations to derive a general necessary and sufficient condition for optimal solutions .",
    "we then derive optimal contracts for yaari s criterion and the general rdu in sections 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "section 6 provides a numerical example to illustrate our results .",
    "finally , we conclude with section 7 .",
    "proofs of some lemmas are placed in an appendix .",
    "in this section , we present the optimal insurance contracting model in which the insured has the rdu type of preferences , followed by its quantile formulation that will facilitate deriving the solutions .",
    "we follow bernard et al .",
    "( 2015 ) for the problem formulation except for one critical difference , which we will highlight .",
    "let @xmath5 be a probability space .",
    "an insured , endowed with an initial wealth @xmath6 , faces a non - negative random loss @xmath7 supported in @xmath8 $ ] , where @xmath9 is a given positive scalar .",
    "he chooses an insurance contract to protect himself from the loss , by paying a premium @xmath10 to the insurer in return for a compensation ( or _ indemnity _ ) in the case of a loss .",
    "this compensation is to be determined as a function of the loss @xmath7 , denoted by @xmath11 throughout this paper .",
    "the _ retention _",
    "function @xmath12 is thereby the part of the loss to be borne by the insured .    for a given @xmath7 , the insured aims to choose an insurance contract that provides the best tradeoff between the premium and compensation based on his risk preference .",
    "in this paper , we consider the case when insured s preference is of the rdu type .",
    "this rdu preference consists of two components : a @xmath13 function @xmath14 and a probability @xmath15 function @xmath16\\mapsto [ 0,1]$ ] .",
    "let us denote by @xmath17 the rdu of the final ( random ) wealth @xmath18 of an insured , which is a choquet integral of @xmath19 with respect to the capacity @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath21,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of @xmath18 . assuming that @xmath23 is differentiable , we can rewrite @xmath24 if @xmath23 is inverse-@xmath0 shaped , that is , it is first concave and then convex",
    "; see figure 1 , then the above expression shows that the role @xmath23 plays is to overweigh both tails of @xmath18 when evaluating the mean of @xmath19 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the insurer is risk - neutral and the cost of offering the compensation is proportional to the expectation of the indemnity , then the premium to be charged for an insurance contract should satisfy the participation constraint @xmath25,\\ ] ] where the constant @xmath26 is the _ safety loading _ of the insurer .",
    "it is natural to require an indemnity function to satisfy @xmath27 a constraint that has been imposed in most insurance contracting literature .",
    "if the insured s preference is dictated by the classical eu theory , then the optimal contract is typically a deductible contract which automatically renders the indemnity function increasing ; see e.g. arrow ( 1971 ) and raviv ( 1979 ) .",
    "however , for the rdu preference the resulting optimal indemnity may not be an increasing function , as shown in bernard et al .",
    "this may potentially cause moral hazard as pointed out earlier .",
    "similarly , a non - monotone retention function may also lead to moral hazard .",
    "consequently , to include the increasing constraint on the contract has been an outstanding open question .    in this paper",
    ", we require the indemnity function to satisfy @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "in other words , we constrain _ both _ indemnity and retention functions to be globally increasing",

    "the first part of assumption [ assump:21 ] , crucial for the quantile formulation , is standard ; see e.g. raviv ( 1979 ) .",
