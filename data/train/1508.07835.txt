    "the suppression of oscillation and the revival of oscillation are two opposite but interrelated important emergent phenomena in coupled oscillators . in the suppression of oscillation , oscillators arrive at a common homogeneous steady state ( hss ) or different branches of an inhomogeneous steady state ( ihss ) under some proper parametric and coupling conditions . the former is called the amplitude death ( ad ) state @xcite , whereas the latter is denoted as the oscillation death ( od ) state @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the revival of oscillation is a process by which the rhythmic behavior ( or rhythmicity ) of individual nodes in a network of coupled oscillators is restored from an ad / od state without changing the intrinsic parameters associated with the individual nodes @xcite .    in the oscillation quenched ( suppressed ) state the dynamic nature of individual coupled oscillators",
    "this has many potential applications : for example , the ad state is important to suppress unwanted oscillations that hinder a certain process , e.g. , in laser systems , chattering in mechanical drilling process , etc @xcite .",
    "similarly , the od state has a significant role in understanding of many biological processes , e.g. , synthetic genetic oscillator @xcite , cardiovascular phenomena @xcite , cellular differentiation @xcite , etc . on the other hand ,",
    "the research in the topic of revival of oscillation is important because many physical , environmental , biological and social processes require _ stable _ and _ robust _ oscillations for their proper functioning : examples include , el nio / southern oscillation in ocean and atmosphere @xcite , brain waves in neuroscience @xcite , electric power generators @xcite , cardiopulmonary sinus rhythm of pacemaker cells @xcite , etc . in these systems",
    "the suppression of oscillation may result in a fatal system breakdown or an irrecoverable physiological malfunction .",
    "thus , it has to be ensured that , if these type of systems are trapped in an oscillation cessation state , that state has to be revoked in order to establish rhythmicity .",
    "a recent burst of publications reveal many aspects of ad and od : in particular , identifying coupling schemes to induce them @xcite , transition from ad to od @xcite , their experimental verifications @xcite , etc .",
    "but only a few techniques have been reported to revoke ad / od and induce rhythmicity in a network of oscillators @xcite . in ref.@xcite several variants of time delay techniques",
    "are discussed in order to revoke death states , whereas in ref.@xcite , network connections are chosen properly in order to revive oscillations .",
    "however , most of these techniques lack the generality to revive oscillations from a death state .",
    "only recently a general technique to revive oscillation from the oscillation suppressed state ( or death state ) has been reported by @xcite .",
    "the authors proposed a simple but effective way to revoke the death state and induce rhythmicity by introducing a simple feedback factor in the diffusive coupling .",
    "they showed that this technique is robust enough to induce rhythmicity in a diffusively coupled network of nonlinear oscillators , such as , the stuart - landau oscillator , brusselators model , chaotic lorenz system , cell membrane model , etc .",
    "they further tested the effectiveness of their proposed technique in conjugate @xcite and dynamic coupling @xcite .",
    "however , in the absence of parameter mismatch or coupling time - delay , simple diffusive coupling can not induce ad in coupled oscillators .",
    "therefore , for identical oscillators under diffusive coupling ( without coupling delay ) no ad is possible and thus the issue of revoking the ad state does not arise .",
    "also , od in diffusively coupled identical oscillators is always accompanied by a limit cycle , thus one needs to choose proper initial conditions to revoke that death state .",
    "regarding the conjugate coupling , it is not always a general technique to induce death : for example , in a first - order intrinsic time - delay system no conjugate coupling is possible .",
    "further , the dynamic coupling has its own pitfalls ( e.g. , its success strongly depends on the intrinsic properties of the oscillators under consideration ) , which has been discussed in detail in  @xcite .    in this context the mean - field diffusive coupling",
    "is a general way to induce ad / od even in networks of _ identical _ coupled oscillators : it works in any network of oscillators including chaotic first - order intrinsic time - delay systems @xcite .",
    "further , it has been shown in  @xcite that , unlike diffusive coupling , the od state induced by the mean - field diffusive coupling is not accompanied by a limit cycle . also , the mean - field diffusive coupling is the most natural coupling scheme that occurs in physics @xcite , biology @xcite , ecology @xcite , etc .",
    "thus , for those systems that always need a robust limit cycle for their proper functioning , the mean - field diffusive coupling is a much stronger `` trap '' to induce death in comparison with the other coupling schemes .",
    "therefore , it is important to study the process of revoking the oscillation suppression state induced by the mean - field diffusive coupling and revive oscillation from the death state .",
    "motivated by the above facts , in this paper we introduce a feedback factor in the _ mean - field diffusive coupling _ and examine its effect in a network of coupled oscillators .",
    "we show that the interplay of the _ feedback factor _ and the _ density of mean - field _ coupling can restore rhythmicity from a death state even in a network of identical coupled oscillators .",
    "thus , unlike ref .",
    "@xcite , here we have two control parameters that enable us to revoke the death state . using rigorous eigenvalue and bifurcation analyses on coupled van der pol and stuart - landau oscillators , separately , we show that the region of the death state shrinks substantially in the parameter space depending upon those two control parameters .",
    "we also extend our results to a network consisting of a large number of mean - field coupled oscillators and show that the revival of rhythmicity works in the spatially extended systems , also .",
    "further , for the first time , we report an experimental observation of the revival of oscillation from death states induced by the mean - field coupling that qualitatively supports our theoretical results .",
    "at first we consider a network of @xmath0 van der pol ( vdp ) oscillators interacting through a modified mean - field diffusive coupling ; the mathematical model of the coupled system is given by    [ systemvdp ] @xmath1    here @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the mean - field of the coupled system .",
    "the individual vdp oscillators show a near sinusoidal oscillation for smaller @xmath4 , and relaxation oscillation for larger @xmath4 .",
    "the coupling strength is given by @xmath5 ; @xmath6 is called the mean - field density parameter that determines the _ density of the mean - field _ @xcite ( @xmath7 ) ; it actually provides an additional free parameter that controls the mean - field dynamics : @xmath8 indicates the self - feedback case , whereas @xmath9 represents the maximum mean - field density .",
    "the feedback term @xmath10 controls the rate of diffusion ( @xmath11 ) : @xmath12 represents the maximum feedback and the original mean - field diffusive coupling ; @xmath13 represents the absence of a feedback and thus that of diffusion . any values in between this limit can be treated as the intermediate diffusion rate and thus represent a modified mean - field diffusive coupling . the origin of @xmath10 is well discussed in  @xcite where it is speculated that it may arise in the context of cell cycle , neural network and synchronization engineering .",
    "as the limiting case we take two identical vdp oscillators : @xmath14 . from eq .",
    "we can see that there are the following fixed points : the origin @xmath15 and two more coupling dependent fixed points : ( i ) ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",

    "<S> two control parameters _ , namely the _ density of the mean - field _ and the _ feedback parameter _ that can be controlled to revive oscillation from a death state . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that an appropriate choice of density of the mean - field is capable of inducing rhythmicity even in the presence of complete diffusion , which is an unique feature of this mean - field coupling that is not available in other coupling schemes . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we report the _ first _ experimental observation of revival of oscillation from the mean - field  induced oscillation suppression state that supports our theoretical results .    , </S>"
