    "complex dynamical systems , ranging from ecosystems and the climate to gene regulatory networks and financial markets , are known to exhibit abrupt shifts from one dynamical regime to a contrasting one at critical parameter values @xcite .",
    "examples of sudden regime shifts include the collapse of vegetation when semi - arid conditions prevail , the transition from a clear lake to a turbid one , sudden changes in fish / wildlife populations @xcite , distinct changes in the climate and patterns of oceanic circulation @xcite , financial markets undergoing global crashes @xcite , spontaneous systemic failures such as asthma attacks @xcite , or epileptic seizures @xcite etc . in a gene regulatory network ,",
    "a sudden transition may occur from one stable gene expression state to another at a critical parameter value @xcite .",
    "the induction of the _ lac _ operon in _",
    "e. coli _ results in the synthesis of the protein @xmath0-_galactosidase _ required for breaking up sugar molecules and releasing energy to the cell .",
    "there is now experimental evidence @xcite that an abrupt transition from the uninduced ( @xmath0-_galactosidase _ level low ) state to the induced ( @xmath0-_galactosidase _ level high ) state of the _ lac _ operon occurs at a critical value of an inducer concentration .",
    "the regime / state shifts in the examples mentioned above are mostly a consequence of the fold - bifurcation ( or the fold - catastrophe ) , well - characterized in dynamical systems theory @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] illustrates a specific type of the fold - bifurcation based on bistability and hysteresis , which provides a physical understanding of the features associated with sudden regime shifts .",
    "the plot represents the steady states of a dynamical system versus a specific parameter .",
    "the state of the dynamical system at time @xmath1 is defined by the magnitudes of the relevant variables at @xmath1 . in the steady state ,",
    "the net rate of change in the magnitude of a variable is zero so that there is no further time evolution .",
    "the solid lines in figure [ fig1 ] denote stable steady states separated by a branch ( dotted line ) of unstable steady states .",
    "the steady state curve is folded backwards giving rise to bistability , i.e. , the existence of two stable steady states in the shaded region .",
    "the parameter values @xmath2 and @xmath3 represent the bifurcation points at which the abrupt regime shifts from one stable steady state to another occur .",
    "on crossing the bifurcation point , the system loses bistability and becomes monostable .",
    "the transition from one branch of stable steady states to the other is not reversible but exhibits hysteresis .",
    "this implies that if a transition takes place at a bifurcation point , say the upper one , the reverse transition from the upper to the lower branch occurs at the lower bifurcation point and not at the upper bifurcation point itself .",
    "bistability owes its origin to the presence of one or more positive feedback loops governing the system dynamics with the added condition that the dynamics be sufficiently nonlinear @xcite .",
    "each stable steady state has its own basin of attraction in the state space , i.e. , the space of all states . in the case of more than one stable steady state ,",
    "the location of the initial state of the system in a basin of attraction determines the steady state attained by the system in the course of time .     and @xmath3 are the lower and upper bifurcation points respectively .",
    "the arrows indicate the time evolution of a weakly perturbed system with the system moving towards stable steady states and moving away from unstable steady states ]    the stability of a steady state indicates that the system returns to the state on being weakly perturbed from it .",
    "this is shown by arrow directions in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "if the perturbation is sufficiently strong so that a transition takes place from one basin of attraction to the other , a switch occurs between the stable steady states even before the bifurcation point is reached .",
    "closer the system is to the bifurcation point , the lesser is the magnitude of the perturbation needed to bring about the switch . in the example of figure [ fig1 ] ,",
    "the branch of unstable steady states constitutes the border between the two basins of attraction .",
    "the distance of a stable steady state from the corresponding unstable steady state is a measure of the resilience ( robustness against perturbation ) of the system .",
    "the resilience is gradually weakened as the system approaches a bifurcation point .",
    "the dynamics of natural systems , in general , have a stochastic component due to the presence of random external influences and the inherently probabilistic nature of the processes involved in the dynamics .",
    "consider the dynamics of gene expression in a gene regulatory network .",
    "gene expression consists of two major steps : transcription and translation during which messenger rna ( mrna ) and protein molecules respectively are synthesized .",
    "the biochemical events ( e.g. , the binding of a rna polymerase at the promoter region of the dna to initiate transcription ) constituting gene expression are inherently stochastic in character resulting in fluctuations ( noise ) around mean mrna and protein levels @xcite",
    ". extrinsic influences like variability in the number of regulatory molecules also contribute to the noise . instead of a single steady state protein level , as in the case of deterministic time evolution ,",
    "one now has a steady state probability distribution in the protein levels reflecting the stochastic nature of the time evolution . in the presence of low / moderate amounts of noise , the physical picture",
    "underlying sudden regime shifts still remains valid . as in the case of applied perturbations , fluctuations of sufficiently strong magnitude",
    "can bring about regime shifts before the bifurcation point is crossed .",
    "a number of early signatures of regime shifts have been proposed so far @xcite in the scenario of the fold - bifurcation .",
    "these are the critical slowing down ( csd ) and its associated effects , namely , rising variances and the lag-1 autocorrelation function as the critical transition point is approached , increased skewness in the steady state probability distribution and the presence of flickering transitions between the stable steady states .",
    "the utility of such signals in the cases of ecological and financial systems @xcite and complex deteriorating diseases @xcite is significant , specially , in developing appropriate risk - aversion / management strategies .",
    "also , in the absence of physical models capturing the essential dynamics , one can obtain quantitative measures of the early signatures by analyzing time - series data .        in this paper , we compute quantities providing early signatures of abrupt regime shifts in gene expression dynamics .",
    "we specifically focus on the phenomenon of competence development in the soil bacteria _",
    "b.subtilis _ involving binary gene expression , i.e , the existence of two expression states .",
    "we consider two alternative models of competence development based on bistable and excitable dynamics . in section 2 ,",
    "the two models are described and their different dynamics highlighted . in section 3 , we define the quantitative measures of the early signatures of sudden regime shifts .",
    "section 4 contains the results of our computations on these early signatures .",
    "section 5 contains concluding remarks .",
    "microorganisms like bacteria have to cope with a number of stresses during their lifetime .",
    "the bacteria adopt a number of strategies to enhance their chances of survival under changed circumstances @xcite .",
    "one of these is the generation of phenotypic heterogeneity ( no genetic change ) in the bacterial population so that a fraction of the population , even if small , may survive under stressful conditions . in the _ b.subtilis _ population ,",
    "only a part of the population , in which the level of a key transcription factor comk is high , develops competence @xcite .",
    "the rest of the population is in the so - called vegetative state .",
    "the comk protein acts as a master regulator activating the transcription of several genes including those essential for the uptake of foreign dna from the environment .",
    "the incorporation of the new dna into the bacterial genome confers favorable traits on the bacterial subpopulation with high comk level , enabling the subpopulation to adapt to stress .",
    "the comk activity resulting in the development of competence is in turn controlled by a host of other proteins .",
    "the core module of the complex regulatory network consists of an autoregulatory positive feedback loop in which the comk proteins promote their own production .",
    "the positive feedback gives rise to binary gene expression in the cell population , i.e. , two distinct subpopulations with low and high comk levels respectively .",
    "two independent experiments @xcite provide confirmation that an autoregulatory positive feedback loop of comk production is by itself sufficient to establish binary gene expression in a bacterial population . considering deterministic time evolution , the steady state comk level versus an appropriate gene expression parameter exhibits a hysteresis curve , resulting from the fold - bifurcation , similar to the one shown in figure [ fig1 ] @xcite . in this scenario , if the cells in a population are prepared to be in the same initial state , all the cells evolve to the same final state giving rise to a homogeneous cell population .",
    "the generation of heterogeneity in the form of two distinct subpopulations is brought about by fluctuation - driven transitions between the low and high comk expression states , the fluctuations being associated with the comk levels .",
    "this gives rise to the experimentally observed @xcite bimodal distribution in the comk levels , i.e. , a distribution with two prominent peaks .",
    "there is now experimental evidence @xcite that a lower fraction of the _ b.subtilis _ population develops competence with reduced noise in the low comk level .",
    "an alternative physical mechanism underlying competence development has been proposed by sel et .",
    "@xcite in terms of excitability in the dynamics of the genetic circuit .",
    "the excitable core module consists of both positive and negative feedback loops which bring about a transient activation to the high comk state . in this case , there is only one stable steady state ( low comk level ) and two unstable steady states the lower of which , in terms of the comk level , sets a threshold for switching @xcite .",
    "fluctuations in the low comk level activate the switch to expression states in the neighborhood of the state with high comk level which constitutes an unstable steady state .",
    "the transient activation is followed by an ultimate return to the stable low comk state . at any instant of time ,",
    "the population divides into two subpopulations with low and high comk levels respectively , signifying a different origin for the bimodal distribution . quantitative time lapse fluorescence microscopy provides experimental evidence @xcite of the probabilistic and transient differentiation into competence .",
    "we first consider model 1 in which the protein product of a single gene autoactivates its own production via a positive feedback loop .",
    "the genetic circuit is shown in figure [ fig2](a ) and , as mentioned earlier , constitutes a core module of the complex network resulting in competence development .",
    "the proteins synthesized by the _ comk _ gene form dimers .",
    "the dimer molecules bind at the promoter region of the dna and activate gene expression .",
    "the gene also synthesizes proteins at a basal level .",
    "a kinetic scheme of the model is as follows @xcite : @xmath4 the gene can be in two possible states : inactive ( @xmath5 ) and active ( @xmath6 ) .",

    "the stability landscape @xmath25 versus @xmath23 for three values of the bifurcation parameter is also shown .",
    "as one moves toward the lower bifurcation point @xmath26 , indicated by an arrow in the region of bistability , the basin of attraction corresponding to the high stable expression state becomes flatter . at the bifurcation point itself , the return time @xmath27 , associated with the csd , becomes zero . ]",

    "in addition there is a negative feedback loop in which the comk protein represses the expression of the _ coms _ gene whereas the coms protein inhibits the degradation of comk by the meca - clpp - clpc complex .",
