    "the t2k collaboration recently gives that the reactor angle is @xcite @xmath8 with best fit value of @xmath9 for normal ( inverted ) hierarchy in the neutrino masses .",
    "such a result must be taken as a hint since it is only at 2@xmath10 .",
    "we however consider the implications of such an important indication in this paper .    in the last decade , the tri - bimaximal ( tb ) mixing pattern introduced by harrison _",
    "_ in 2002@xcite @xmath11 has been used as a guide in neutrino physics for the flavor problem .",
    "however if the result of t2k will be confirmed , it will have strong impact on this point of view .",
    "in fact , most of the models predicting tri - bimaximal mixing at the leading order are compatible only with small values of the reactor angle . in a generic model ,",
    "the three mixing angles receive corrections of the same order .",
    "departure of the solar angle from the trimaximal values are at most of @xmath12(@xmath13 ) where @xmath14 .",
    "therefore it is possible to have a deviation of order @xmath15 only @xcite for the reactor angle which is about half of the lower bound in([exp ] ) .",
    "this is only an estimation and it must be considered individually case by case .",
    "we however expect that most of them are on the border of validity if not excluded completely .",
    "therefore it is important to search for the models with large @xmath0 and with maximal atmospheric mixing angle and trimaximal by trimaximal solar angle . ] solar angle .",
    "recently , some works fitting t2k result has been presented @xcite .",
    "there are some models based on discrete flavor symmetries before t2k data which predicts large reactor mixing angle , for an incomplete list see reference @xcite , and for a classification of models with flavor symmetries classified by its predictions for reactor angle see @xcite    in this paper , we study the possibility to obtain the large reactor angle with tri - bimaximal values of the solar and atmospheric mixing angles .",
    "the lepton mixing matrix with such mixing pattern was first proposed by king in @xcite and called tri - bimaximal - reactor ( tbr ) mixing .",
    "using such mixing matrix , we found the structure of the deviations in the neutrino mass matrix from its tb texture which leads to tbr mixing .",
    "we then show that such a particular deviation in neutrino mass matrix can arise in a model with @xmath7 flavor symmetry .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we discuss the conditions to obtain a mass matrix with maximal atmospheric mixing angle , trimaximal solar mixing angle and a non - zero reactor mixing angle within the t2k region in section [ lr ] . in section [ model ] , we present a model based on the group of permutation of four objects , @xmath7 where the neutrino mass matrix with particular form discussed in section [ lr ] is obtained . finally , we discuss the phenomenology of the model and conclude in in section [ pheno ] .",
    "in this section , we study the structure of the neutrino mass matrix ( in the diagonal basis of the charged leptons ) that gives maximal atmospheric angle @xmath16 , trimaximal solar angle @xmath17 and an arbitrary reactor angle @xmath18 . in the standard pdg @xcite parametrization , the lepton mixing matrix with the above values of mixing angles is given by @xcite @xmath19 we do not consider the cp violation in the lepton sector assume that the above parameters are real for simplicity . the neutrino mass matrix diagonalized by([lrtb ] ) is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a diagonal matrix with the neutrino mass eigenvalues , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "this leads to the following structure of the neutrino mass matrix @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 and @xmath29 with @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "note that @xmath35 can be reabsorbed into the tb term @xmath36 .",
    "the above form of neutrino mass matrix predicts maximal atmospheric mixing angle and trimaximal solar mixing angle if all the terms with all powers of @xmath37 are taken into account .",
    "if one truncates the series in eq.([deviation ] ) at @xmath38 , the neutrino mass matrix then implies    * \\(a ) negligible deviations from maximality in the atmospheric mixing angle ; * \\(b ) small deviation from trimaximality in the solar mixing angle ; * \\(c ) prediction of @xmath39 .",
    "the prediction ( c ) is evident from eq.([deviation ] ) and we verify numerically ( a ) and ( b ) in the section [ pheno ] .",
    "we observe that the main structure of the deviation @xmath40 of order @xmath37 in eq.([deviation ] ) is @xmath41-@xmath42 antisymmetric , see@xcite of order @xmath37 in eq.([deviation ] ) is similar to the one found in the paper by t. araki in ref.@xcite where ( contrary with respect to us ) the solar angle is not fixed to be the trimaximal one . ] .",
    "therefore a possible flavor symmetry with neutrino mass matrix texture ( [ mlrtb ] ) must contain the group @xmath43 of the @xmath41-@xmath42 permutation and must be compatible with tri - bimaximal in the unperturbed limit . one possible flavor symmetry with such features is @xmath7 which contains @xmath43 as a subgroup and leads to tri - bimaximal mixing@xcite .",
    "we assume @xmath7 ( see appendix ) flavor symmetry and extra abelian @xmath44 symmetry in order to separate the charged leptons from the neutrino sector as usual in models for tb mixing , see for instance @xcite . in order to simplify the model as much as possible and to render more clear the main features of the model",
    ", we do not enter into the details of the particular @xmath44 symmetry required in this model .",
    "our purpose is to show that the neutrino mass matrix ( [ mlrtb ] ) with the structure given by ( [ mntbm ] ) and ( [ deviation ] ) can be obtained from symmetry principle .",
    "we assume that light neutrino masses arise from both type - i and type - ii seesaw and introduce only one right - handed neutrino .",
    "the matter content of our model is given in table[tab1 ] .",
    ".matter content of the model giving tb mixing at the leading order [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the scalar sector , we have one @xmath45 triplet @xmath46 and one singlet @xmath47 in the neutrino sector transforming both as @xmath48 of @xmath7 .",
    "we have two electroweak singlets @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the charged lepton sector , transforming as doublet and singlet of @xmath7 respectively . as it has been already mentioned , the two sectors can be separated by introducing an abelian @xmath44 symmetry under which @xmath51 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are charged while the other fields could be singlets of @xmath44 .",
    "the yukawa interaction of the model is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is an effective scale .",
    "we assume the following @xmath7 alignment in the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the scalar fields .",
    "@xmath54 where @xmath55 . using the product rules shown in appendix a",
    ", one can easily see that the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal and the lepton masses can be fitted in terms of three free parameters @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , see @xcite for details .",
    "the type - ii seesaw gives a contribution to the neutrino mass matrix with zero diagonal entries and equal off diagonal entries since it arises from the product of three @xmath7 triplets .",
    "since we introduced only one right - handed neutrino , dirac neutrino mass matrix is a column @xmath59 and the light - neutrino mass matrix from seesaw relation is given by @xmath60 considering both the type - i and type - ii contributions , we have the light neutrino mass matrix which can be diagonalized by tb mixing matrix @xcite ) has been obtained through only type - ii seesaw and @xmath7 symmetry . ]",
    "@xmath61 the mass eigenvalues of the above matrix are @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 . here",
    "@xmath65 and @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "this neutrino mass matrix is compatible with the normal hierarchy only and predicts zero neutrinoless double beta decay @xmath68 .    in order to reproduce deviations like eq.([deviation ] ) in the neutrino mass matrix , we introduce in the scalar sector one higgs triplet @xmath69 that transforms as a doublet under @xmath7 and an electroweak singlet @xmath70 that transforms as a triplet @xmath48 under @xmath7 . with inclusion of these fields ,",
    "the yukawa interaction lagrangian @xmath71 contains also the terms @xmath72 we assume that @xmath69 and @xmath70 take vevs along the following directions @xmath73 here we also assume that @xmath74 .",
    "this can be realized assuming that @xmath69 and @xmath70 are charged under some extra abelian symmetry like @xmath44 or @xmath75 .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking and integrating out the right - handed neutrino , eq .",
    "( [ lag2 ] ) gives the following contribution to the neutrino mass matrix @xmath76 the second term in eq.([eff ] ) is smaller with respect to the first since we have assumed @xmath77 .",
    "in particular assuming @xmath78 and @xmath79 the first term is proportional to @xmath37 and the second term is proportional to @xmath80 .",
    "the extra contributions to the neutrino mass matrix from the type - i see - saw are as follows @xmath81 where , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are coefficients of order @xmath84 . from the extra type - ii seesaw term in eq .",
    "( [ lag2 ] ) and using the vev alignments as in ( [ all2 ] ) , the additional contribution to the perturbed neutrino mass matrix will be proportional to @xmath85 , therefore the contribution to the neutrino mass matrix coming from type - ii see - saw is @xmath86 putting all these results together , the structure of the deviation in neutrino mass matrix can be written is @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 .    the deviation obtained in our model equal to the neutrino mass deviation in eq.([deviation ] ) truncated at @xmath80 with @xmath91 .",
    "such a difference does not modify significantly the prediction of maximal atmospheric angle and trimaximal solar angle . in the next section ,",
    "we study the phenomenological implication of our neutrino mass texture .",
    "combining eq . ( [ mn0 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ dmn ] ) , the resulting neutrino mass matrix in our model is @xmath92 as mentioned earlier , we assume @xmath93 and @xmath94 which implies the hierarchies in the elements @xmath95 in the above structure . since the @xmath96 entry is @xmath97 , we have neutrino less double beta decay rate @xmath98 and for small values of @xmath37 as in the unperturbed case only the normal neutrino mass hierarchy can be fitted . the neutrino mass matrix([last ] ) obtained from the model is equivalent to the matrix([mlrtb ] ) up to the correction of @xmath12(@xmath80 ) , the neutrino mass matrix([last ] ) is diagonalized by the mixing matrix([lrtb ] ) up to @xmath12(@xmath80 ) corrections .",
    "note that the neutrino mass matrix([last ] ) obtained in the model has 5 free parameters while the derived structure in eq.([lrtb ] ) has 4 real parameters ( @xmath99 and @xmath37 ) .",
    "we fix free parameters of eq.([last ] ) in terms of the parameters of eq.([lrtb ] ) by comparing both the structures at each order of @xmath37 . comparing the leading order expressions of the neutrino mass matrix in eq.([mn0 ] ) and",
    "eq.([mntbm ] ) , we restrict our parameters to be @xmath100 further comparing the higher order terms in @xmath37 , we obtain the relations @xmath101    note that this is not the most general case for our model , nevertheless we want to point out that even in the case of bimaximal atmospheric mixing angle and trimaximal solar mixing angle it is possible to obtain large reactor mixing angle .",
    "also , we expect the negligible deviations from the tri - bimaximal values for the solar and atmospheric mixing angles due to the fact that our model predicts @xmath91 if compared with eq.([mlrtb ] ) and it generates the terms only up to the @xmath12(@xmath80 ) .",
    "we analyze such deviations by randomly varying @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath37 with the constraints that the square mass differences and the mixing angles are in the observed ( 3@xmath10 ) range of validity @xcite .",
    "the results of our analysis are shown in figure [ figt ] .",
    "it is evident from figure [ figt ] that for restricted parameter space as specified earlier , model allows large @xmath0 with negligible deviations in atmospheric and solar mixing angles from there bimaximal and trimaximal values respectively .",
    "we also check the predictions for the neutrinoless double beta decay rates in our model for restricted parameter space specified above and find that the region for 4.5 mev @xmath104 5.8 mev and 0.5 mev latexmath:[$ <    @xmath0 in the 2@xmath10 limits indicated by t2k .    .",

    ". the deviation must be approximately @xmath41-@xmath42 antisymmetric .",
