    "local - optimality is often used as a sufficient condition for successful decoding of finite - length codes ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in this work we focus on two parameters of the local - optimality characterization for tanner codes",
    "the first parameter is related to the minimum distance of the local codes in ( expander ) tanner codes .",
    "the second parameter is related to the finite number of iterations used in iterative decoding , even when number of iterations exceeds the girth of the tanner graph .",
    "we define hierarchies of local - optimality with respect to these parameters .",
    "these hierarchies provide a partial explanation of two questions about successful decoding with ml - certificates : ( 1 )  what is the effect of increasing the minimum distance of the local codes in tanner codes ? ( 2 )  what is the effect of increasing the number of iterations beyond the girth in iterative decoding ?    _",
    "previous work : _ suboptimal decoding of expander tanner codes was analyzed in many works ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the results in these analyses rely on : ( i )  the expansion properties of the tanner graph , and ( ii )  constant relative minimum distances of the local codes .",
    "the error - correcting guarantees in these analyses improve as the expansion factor and relative minimum distance increase .",
    "the first part of our work focuses on the effect of increasing the minimum distance of the local codes on error correcting guarantees of tanner codes by ml - decoding and lp - decoding .",
    "density evolution ( de ) is used to study the asymptotic performance of decoding algorithms based on belief - propagation ( bp ) ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "convergence of bp - based decoding algorithms to some fixed point was studied in  @xcite . however , convergence guarantees do not imply successful decoding after a finite number of iterations .",
    "korada and urbanke  @xcite provide an asymptotic analysis of iterative decoding `` beyond '' the girth .",
    "specifically , they prove that one may exchange the order of the limits in de - analysis of bp - decoding under certain conditions ( i.e. , variable node degree at least @xmath3 and bounded llrs ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the second part of our work focuses on properties of iterative decoding of finite - length codes using a finite number of iterations .    a new local - optimality characterization for a codeword in a tanner code w.r.t .",
    "any mbios channel was presented in  @xcite .",
    "a locally - optimal codeword is guaranteed to be both the unique maximum - likelihood ( ml ) codeword as well as the unique lp - decoding codeword .",
    "the characterization of local - optimality for tanner codes has three parameters : ( i )  a height @xmath4 , ( ii )  level weights @xmath5 , and ( iii )  a degree @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the smallest minimum distance of the component local codes .",
    "a new message - passing decoding algorithm , called _ normalized weighted min - sum _ ( nwms ) , was presented for tanner codes with single parity - check ( spc ) local codes  @xcite .",
    "the nwms  decoder is guaranteed to compute the ml - codeword in @xmath0 iterations provided that a locally - optimal codeword with height parameter @xmath0 exists .",
    "the number of iterations @xmath0 may exceed the girth of the tanner graph .    _",
    "contribution : _ to obtain one of the hierarchy results , we needed a new definition of local - optimality called _ strong local - optimality_. we prove that if a codeword is strongly locally - optimal , then it is also locally - optimal ( lemma  [ lemma : nloinlo ] ) .",
    "hence , previous results proved for local - optimality  @xcite hold also for strong local - optimality .",
    "we present two combinatorial hierarchies : ( 1 )  a _ hierarchy of local - optimality based on degrees_. the degree hierarchy states that a locally - optimal codeword @xmath8 with degree parameter @xmath9 is also locally - optimal with respect to any degree parameter @xmath10 .",
    "the degree hierarchy implies that the occurrence of local - optimality does not decrease as the degree parameter increases .",
    "( 2 )  a _ hierarchy of strong local - optimality based on height_. the height hierarchy states that if a codeword @xmath8 is strongly locally - optimal with respect to height parameter @xmath0 , then it is also strongly locally - optimal with respect to every height parameter that is an integer multiple of @xmath0 .",
    "the height hierarchy proves , for example , that the performance of iterative decoding with an ml - certificate ( e.g. , nwms ) of finite - length tanner codes with spc local codes does not degrade as the number of iterations grows , even beyond the girth of the tanner graph .",
