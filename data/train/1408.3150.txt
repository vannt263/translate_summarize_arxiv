    "<S> when considering both an overlap of cbed disks ( @xmath54 ) and elastic scattering of the incoming electron probe ( @xmath77 ) , the inelastic scattering cross - section contains several terms with imaginary part of mdff . </S>",
    "<S> some of the terms are strictly antisymmetric and do not depend on @xmath60 , but other terms depend on a phase difference via the real and imaginary parts of the phase factor , @xmath78 , multiplying them . </S>",
    "<S> thus an optimum phase distribution in the wave front may be rather complicated and will depend on the particular crystal structure and magnetic symmetry via dynamical diffraction effects .    with evbs , </S>",
    "<S> when imaginary part of mdff is multiplied by the real ( imaginary ) part of the phase factor , @xmath78 , it leads to an antisymmetric ( symmetric ) emcd distribution , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to observe how the symmetric contribution develops as the convergence angle increases . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : qmaxmaps ] and in supplementary fig .  1 for bcc iron crystal with @xmath79   , beam direction along @xmath80 zone axis , and using an acceleration voltage of 200  kv . </S>",
    "<S> the overlap onsets when @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the smallest allowed reflection in a bcc structure . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath19 must be larger than @xmath83  a.u.@xmath69 so that the cbed discs will overlap and @xmath9 becomes non - empty . integrating the distribution of the magnetic signal over a circular aperture of diameter @xmath84  mrad leads to a zero magnetic signal for @xmath85  a.u.@xmath69 and nonzero above . clearly , when the cbed discs do not overlap ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : qmaxmaps ] , left column ) , the emcd is antisymmetrically distributed with respect to all mirror axes  </S>",
    "<S> horizontal , vertical and two diagonal ones  as anticipated . </S>",
    "<S> above the onset of overlap this antisymmetry is broken .    </S>",

    "<S> b ) non - magnetic and c ) magnetic component of the energy - filtered diffraction pattern at @xmath72 edge of iron , @xmath87.,width=325 ]    note that for a discrete set of mirror symmetries , as in the case of a bcc crystal , it is easy to construct a beam with a phase distribution , which has antisymmetric phase differences @xmath60 with respect to all of the four mirror axes , but which is not a vortex beam carrying oam . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a four - fold astigmatism @xcite has the required symmetry , because for any @xmath7 the @xmath16 changes sign under mirror symmetry , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : star]a . an explicit calculation of the inelastic electron scattering reveals an emcd signal distribution , which is indeed not antisymmetric . </S>",
    "<S> the fe l@xmath88 signal for bcc iron integrated over a finite collection angle centered on a transmitted beam presents an emcd of relative intensity of about 1% . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of this emcd signal is only about half of what it was reported in the first emcd experiment @xcite , but with the main difference that it has atomic spatial resolution . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , with this approach one can use the full intensity of the electron beam because there is no need of a spiral @xcite or fork aperture @xcite , which should result in better signal to noise ratio emcd measurements than with evbs @xcite .    in conclusion , we show that a finite emcd signal with atomic resolution can be observed at the transmitted beam without the necessity of using evbs carrying oam . </S>",
    "<S> the conditions necessary for emcd are : 1 ) convergence angle large enough to cause an overlap of cbed disks and , 2 ) a phase distribution of the probe in reciprocal space that is not invariant under mirror symmetries of the crystal . as a corollary we propose a simple beam shape , which can be readily obtained in current aberration - corrected stem instruments , and which should allow to measure emcd at the transmitted beam . the emcd signal obtained with the method presented can achieve atomic resolution and be as strong as emcd nanodiffraction experiments . in a more general context </S>",
    "<S> , our work opens up new ways of utilizing aberration - correction electron optics to design atomic - size electron probes with tailored phase distributions for specific applications and/or crystal symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> these electron probes could be utilized to probe magnetic dichroism , optical dichroism , and the valley polarization of materials with unmatched spatial resolution .    </S>",
