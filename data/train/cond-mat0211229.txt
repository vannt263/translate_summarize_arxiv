    "for a broad category of physical problems , a free polymer is characterized by two lengths : the total contour length ( @xmath1 ) and the persistence length ( @xmath2 ) which is the correlation length of the tangent unit vector along its contour and is proportional to its bending rigidity .",
    "when the persistence length is much smaller than the total length , the polymer is said to be flexible and can be treated as a random walk .",
    "when the two lengths are of the same order , the polymer is said to be semiflexible .",
    "some of the most important biopolymers belong to the latter class .",
    "for example , the structural elements of the cytoskeleton are microtubules , actin filaments , and intermediate filaments with persistence lengths of the order of @xmath3 @xcite , @xmath4 @xcite , and @xmath5 @xcite respectively .",
    "although dna filaments usually have a total length greater than the persistence length ( @xmath6 ) , the latter is long enough to affect their elastic properties.@xcite obvious biological relevance and inherent theoretical challenges have sparked great interest in the statistical mechanics of semiflexible polymers in recent years.@xcite    a theoretical analysis of the unbinding of semiflexible polymers from fixed surfaces or interfaces ( adsorption - desorption transition ) or of two semiflexible strands from each other is a particularly tricky problem .",
    "the main reason is that sharp phase transitions in statistical mechanics occur only in the thermodynamic limit and the thermodynamic limit of semiflexible polymers is ambiguous .",
    "if we keep the persistence length fixed and take the total contour length to infinity , we obtain a flexible polymer .",
    "if we take the persistence length to infinity keeping the total length fixed , we obtain a rigid rod without any fluctuations .",
    "there have been several studies of this subject over the past few years.@xcite in all of those works the polymer binds to a potential well which _ continuously _ extends over the surface ( or interface ) . in this article",
    ", we consider a simple model where a weakly bending semiflexible polymer in @xmath0 dimensions is bound to a fluid surface ( or interface ) through a _ discrete _ sequence of regularly placed pinning sites ( `` sticky points '' ) along its length .",
    "such a model resembles the physical situation where an actin filament binds to a membrane through anchoring proteins.@xcite the discreteness of the binding sites allows us to employ a different kind of thermodynamic limit which avoids the inconsistencies that appear in some previous works . for fixed total length and persistence length ( with @xmath7 ) , we take the density of binding sites to infinity under the constraint that the probability of finding such a site inside the binding region remains constant .",
    "thus we obtain a second order unbinding transition and a melting temperature which is a function of of the persistence length , the spacing between pinning sites , a microscopic length which characterizes a bond , and the bond energy .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we calculate the probability of finding a binding site of the polymer inside a small ( microscopic ) region which characterizes a bond .",
    "we then consider the simplest version of our model which is a filament with only one pinning site . in sec .",
    "iii we use a necklace model @xcite type of approach which yields the thermal depinning transition . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss the effect of the bending rigidity on the force - induced unbinding of semiflexible polymers in the stiff limit . finally , in sec .",
    "v we demonstrate the subtleties of this problem comparing our model with other approaches and we present our conclusions .",
    "a widely used model which captures much of the physics of semiflexible polymers ( except for their self - avoidance ) is the worm - like chain ( wlc)@xcite where the polymer is considered to be a continuous inextensible curve @xmath8 parametrized by the arc length @xmath9 measured along its contour from a fixed end .",
