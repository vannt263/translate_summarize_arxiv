    "diffusion processes arise in many important fields , including finance , genetics , and engineering @xcite .",
    "there is great interest in simulation and inference using diffusions , but this is a difficult problem because the transition density function of a diffusion is rarely known .",
    "it is typical to work with a discretization of an intractable diffusion model so that monte carlo simulation can be applied .",
    "for example , the euler scheme is a discretization of time in which increments of the diffusion over each small time step are assumed to be gaussian .",
    "there has been much work into improving this and other discretized approaches @xcite , but a disadvantage is that they introduce two sources of error : a monte carlo error and a discretization error .",
    "the latter causes a bias , and it may be computationally expensive to make the grid spacing sufficiently fine to ensure this bias is negligible .",
    "however , for a certain class of diffusion processes described below , recent work based on _ retrospective _ sampling ideas has obviated the need for discretization , allowing realizations to be simulated _ exactly _ @xcite .",
    "the key idea is to use brownian motion as the proposal in a rejection sampling algorithm , in which it is possible to make the accept / reject decision without having to simulate a complete ( infinite - dimensional ) sample path .",
    "this idea has also been extended to perform parametric inference of discretely observed diffusions @xcite .",
    "where the algorithm has been developed for one - dimensional diffusions , it is assumed for the most part that the diffusion has state space @xmath0 with boundaries at @xmath1 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to extend the exact algorithm to diffusion models with a certain class of _ finite _ boundary .",
    "one approach would be a straightforward modification of the algorithm presented in @xcite using brownian motion as the candidate process .",
    "however , it is easy to find examples for which this approach exhibits unacceptably high rejection rates , essentially because the paths of brownian motion do not mimic the paths of the target diffusion sufficiently well near the boundary .",
    "an alternative approach developed in this paper is more drastic and based on a related idea in @xcite : we replace brownian motion in the proposal mechanism with _ another _ well - characterized diffusion , namely the bessel process . as a simple motivating example , suppose we wanted to simulate sample paths of the diffusion with generator @xmath2\\frac{d}{dx } + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d^2}{dx^2},\\ ] ] for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the modified bessel function of the first kind .",
    "this diffusion was introduced by @xcite and studied by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , among others .",
    "the diffusion has state space @xmath6 , and when @xmath7 the boundary at 0 is _ entrance _ in the terminology of feller ( see * ? ? ?",
    "thus , unlike brownian motion which can wander close to 0 , this diffusion should experience a strong repulsive force whenever the diffusion approaches 0 from above , due to the singularity in the drift of asymptotic form @xmath8 as @xmath9 .",
    "hence , a rejection sampling algorithm using brownian motion as a candidate process will have high rejection rates whenever the sample path approaches the boundary .",
    "however , a _ bessel _ process of order @xmath10 shares",
    "this singularity and would make a more suitable candidate process .",
    "( in fact , in this example ( [ eq : besseldriftgen ] ) includes the bessel process itself as the special case @xmath11 .",
    "the diffusion with generator ( [ eq : besseldriftgen ] ) has been described as the _ bessel process in the wide sense _",
    "as will be shown , using a bessel process when the diffusion of interest has a certain type of boundary can substantially improve algorithmic efficiency .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : ea ] i give an overview of the exact algorithms ea13 of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . after summarizing some useful properties of the bessel process in section  [ sec : bessel ] , in section  [ sec : bessel - ea ]",
    "i develop a new exact algorithm that can be applied to a diffusion with a finite entrance boundary .",
    "the algorithm is illustrated in section  [ sec : applications ] by application to conditioned diffusions and to a general diffusion model of population growth . in section  [ sec : twoboundaries ] i discuss the problem of _ two _ finite boundaries and extend ea3 to apply to this case .",
    "section  [ sec : discussion ] discusses possible directions for future research .",
    "consider the scalar diffusion process @xmath12 satisfying the stochastic differential equation ( sde ) @xmath13 with drift coefficient @xmath14 and diffusion coefficient @xmath15 . in all that follows we are interested in the law of the diffusion only up to some fixed , finite time @xmath16 .",
    "we first apply the _ lamperti transform _",
    "@xmath17 defined via @xmath18 for some fixed @xmath19 in the state space of @xmath20 .",
    "the process @xmath21 satisfies @xmath22 where the new drift @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 equation ( [ eq : ysde ] ) , with unit diffusion coefficient , will be our central object of study , and we assume it admits a unique weak solution .",
    "the diffusion coefficient , @xmath25 , of a one - dimensional diffusion can always be reduced to unity in this manner , but we note that the infinitesimal covariance of a multidimensional diffusion may or may not be reducible to the identity matrix ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gives an explicit way to check ) .",
    "the law of @xmath26 , to be denoted @xmath27 , is absolutely continuous with respect to the law of brownian motion commenced from @xmath28 , to be denoted @xmath29 .",
    "this motivates the latter s use for drawing candidates in a rejection sampling algorithm .",
    "the acceptance probability in such an algorithm would be proportional to the radon - nikodm derivative of @xmath27 with respect to @xmath29 , which is given by girsanov s formula ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath30 equation ( [ eq : girsanov ] ) makes it clear why such an algorithm is impossible : to compute the rejection probability one must evaluate integrals over the whole sample path .",
    "exact _ algorithms show how it is possible to make the accept / reject decision without this requirement , using only a finite amount of computation .",
    "i give here a brief overview ; for further details the reader is referred to @xcite .    to proceed we make three further assumptions .    * the radon - nikodm derivative of @xmath31 with respect to @xmath32 exists and",
    "is given by ( [ eq : girsanov ] ) .",
    "* @xmath33 , i.e.  @xmath34 is continuously differentiable .",
    "* @xmath35 is bounded below .    using ( a2 ) and it s lemma applied to @xmath36 ,",
    "we can rewrite ( [ eq : girsanov ] ) as@xmath37dt\\right\\}. \\ ] ] to simplify matters , rather than working directly with @xmath29 we work with the probability measure @xmath38 defined via @xmath39 the measure @xmath38 corresponds to _ biased _ brownian motion @xcite ; it is the law of @xmath40 \\mid b_t \\sim h)$ ] , a brownian motion whose endpoint has pre - specified density proportional to @xmath41 .",
    "paths can be drawn according to @xmath38 first by simulating a random variable @xmath42 and then interpolating from @xmath43 to @xmath44 using the dynamics of a brownian bridge .",
    "this is possible under the additional assumption    * @xmath45 is integrable .",
    "notice that if our interest was to simulate not from ( [ eq : ysde ] ) but rather the sample paths of the corresponding _ bridge _ , with @xmath46 , then we simply adjust this step by replacing @xmath42 with @xmath47 .    under ( a4 ) we can use candidates from @xmath38 instead of @xmath29 ; it is immediate that @xmath48 where @xmath49 - \\inf_{z\\in \\bbr } \\frac{1}{2}[\\alpha^2(z ) + \\alpha'(z)]\\ ] ] is well - defined by ( a2 , a3 ) . as a consequence of ( [ eq : dqdz ] ) ,",
    "if we can propose a candidate path @xmath50)$ ] from @xmath51 and accept it with probability @xmath52 , then the accepted paths are distributed according to @xmath31 .",
    "it remains to construct an event , call it @xmath53 , occurring with the required probability .",
    "inspection of the form of ( [ eq : dqdz ] ) suggests one way to define @xmath53 : as the event that there are no points in the realization of a poisson process occurring at unit rate in the area under the graph of @xmath54 . a practical way to achieve",
    "this is to thin a poisson process occurring in a larger rectangle containing this graph .",
    "more precisely , suppose there exists a random variable @xmath55 and a positive function @xmath56 such that @xmath57 a.s .",

    "the point of first finding an a.s .",
    "upper bound @xmath64 on @xmath65 is to ensure the poisson process has finite total rate , and hence that @xmath53 can be determined with a finite amount of computation .",
    "assuming such a bound can be found , an exact algorithm therefore proceeds as follows : +    * exact algorithm ( ea ) *    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]      +   + given an accepted skeleton , further points can be filled in by simulation from bessel bridges between each skeleton point ( conditional on @xmath66 ) .",
    "no further reference to @xmath27 is necessary .",
    "it seems as though we have just replaced one proposal measure for another .",
    "the benefit of this operation is apparent when we notice that , for certain diffusions , the hypograph of @xmath67 may be dramatically smaller than the hypograph of @xmath54 , manifesting itself via a much lower rejection rate .",
    "for example , if our target drift is of the form @xmath68 as @xmath9 , then @xmath69 whereas @xmath70 remains finite .",
    "thus , we should expect the rejection rate to be improved most when the effect of the boundary is strong and/or the target process spends a great deal of time near the boundary , for example if one end of the bridge is close to @xmath71 .",
    "these observations are verified in an example application later .",
    "first , we must specify an appropriate choice of @xmath66 and @xmath56 , and how to simulate from @xmath72 , which requires further assumptions on @xmath73 .",
    "for simplicity we will focus on the bessel analogue of ea1 , to be denoted bessel - ea1 , for which we assume    * the function @xmath74 is bounded above .",
    "under this assumption we are entitled to choose the non - random @xmath75 and to omit step 2 of bessel - ea .",
    "it remains to simulate skeleton points from the law of a bessel bridge .",
    "i now detail how this can be achieved .    when @xmath76 it is well known that the bessel process is the radial part of a brownian motion in @xmath77 .",
    "it is possible to use this observation to simulate from a bessel bridge by transforming an underlying brownian bridge in @xmath77 sch : etal:2013 .",
    "however , it is in fact possible to simulate exactly from the bessel bridge for _ any _ real @xmath78 , as follows .",
    "we first need a definition .    a random variable @xmath79 on @xmath80",
    "is said to be _",
    "bessel@xmath81-distributed _ when @xmath82 this distribution is constructed by normalizing the coefficients of @xmath83 to sum to @xmath84 .",
    "we define @xmath85 as the continuous limit as @xmath86 ; then @xmath87 a.s . because the bessel distribution is discrete ,",
    "a realization of @xmath79 can be achieved easily by the usual method of simulating a uniform@xmath88 $ ] random variable and inverting the cumulative distribution function of @xmath79 .",
    "[ prop : mak : gle:2010 ] suppose @xmath89 and , independently , @xmath90\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "then marginally under @xmath93 , @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a gamma distribution with shape @xmath96 and rate @xmath97 .",
    ".    using the markov property this result can be applied repeatedly to simulate a set of skeleton points @xmath98 .",
    "furthermore , the rest of the path can be filled in by the following theorem .",
    "let @xmath99 denote the law of a squared bessel bridge commencing from @xmath100 at time @xmath101 and ending at @xmath102 at time @xmath103 .",
    "if @xmath104 is an increasing ordering of the times of the points in @xmath105 output from bessel - ea1 under ( b14 ) and ( b * ) , then the rest of the path , @xmath106\\}$ ] is distributed as @xmath107 where @xmath108\\}$ ] .",
    "this is analogous to theorem 2 of @xcite , and follows from the observation that @xmath109 .",
    "a rich source of processes to which the above theory applies can be constructed as follows .",
    "suppose we have a diffusion satisfying ( [ eq : ysde ] ) , ( a14 ) , and ( * ) , i.e.  it can be simulated by ea1",
    ". then the diffusion @xmath110 obtained by conditioning this process on @xmath111 , i.e.  on reaching some high level @xmath112 before hitting @xmath71 , has new drift and diffusion coefficients given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 dx\\ ] ] is the scale function of the diffusion @xcite .",
    "denote the law of this diffusion by @xmath115 .",
    "for such a process , we have the following result .",
    "[ thm : conditioned ] with the choice @xmath116 , the process @xmath110 satisfies ( b14 ) and ( b * ) .",
    "( b1 ) follows immediately from ( a1 ) and the observation that @xmath117 ; ( b2 ) follows from ( a2 ) and continuity of @xmath96 and @xmath118 ; and ( b4 ) follows from ( a4 ) .",
    "it remains to check that the function @xmath119 is bounded on @xmath120 .",
    "a direct calculation shows that @xmath121(u ) = \\ga^2(u ) + \\ga'(u ) + \\frac{(\\gd - 3)(\\gd - 1)}{4u^2},\\ ] ] which is bounded by ( a3 ) and ( * ) when @xmath116 .",
    "thus , using a @xmath122 process builds the conditioning into every candidate path . an alternative strategy using brownian paths",
    "would be first to simulate the minimum of a @xmath29 process conditioned on its minimum being positive , and then to simulate the requisite bridges either side of this minimum .",
    "this strategy is closely related to that of @xcite , and since these bridges are also in fact bessel bridges of dimension 3 , the two strategies are expected to have very similar performance .",
    "consider the general population growth model @xmath123 , @xmath124 , with generator @xmath125 where @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 ( * ? ? ?",
    "this model includes as special cases the commonly used growth models of geometric brownian motion ( @xmath130 ) and the squared bessel process ( @xmath131 ) . in the latter case",
    "our algorithm would have optimal performance , with rejection rate 0 .",
    "ascertainment bias directs interest to the growth trajectories of populations observed to have grown successfully ; such populations follow the diffusion ( [ eq : growthgen ] ) conditioned as in section  [ sec : conditioned ] . here , theorem  [ thm : conditioned ] does not apply because the unconditioned diffusion does not satisfy ( a2 ) ; however , we can still perform exact simulation using a bessel process , as follows .",
    "we assume @xmath132 and @xmath133 ( other cases are similar but omitted for brevity ) .    applying the lamperti transform ( [ eq : lamperti ] ) to ( [ eq : growthgen ] ) and conditioning via ( [ eq : conditioned ] ) yields , after extensive but routine calculations , a diffusion on @xmath134 with drift and diffusion coefficients @xmath135 - \\frac{\\sqrt{\\go}}{2}\\coth\\left[\\sqrt{\\go}y - \\ln \\gt\\right]\\notag\\\\ & { } + \\frac{\\go - 2\\gk}{\\sqrt{w}}\\frac{\\tanh\\left[\\frac{\\sqrt{\\go}y - \\ln\\gt}{2}\\right]}{1 - \\cosh^{\\frac{4\\gk}{\\go } - 2}\\left[\\frac{\\sqrt{\\go}y - \\ln\\gt}{2}\\right]},\\label{eq : growthdrift}\\\\ \\sigma^2(y ) = { } & 1,\\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this diffusion has an entrance boundary at @xmath136 , so we introduce @xmath137 .",

    "for comparison i also implemented a slight modification of ea2 as discussed in section  [ sec : conditioned ] , which uses brownian motion as its candidate paths : in order to bound @xmath65 , the ea2 algorithm first simulates the minimum of a brownian bridge ( and to respect the lower boundary i further condition it to be positive ) and then fills in skeleton points conditioned on this minimum ( see section  [ sec : ea2 ] ) . to compare the two algorithms , i used two measurements of running time : the total number of random variates generated , and the total running time in seconds .",
    "each algorithm requires 2@xmath152 realizations of random variables to simulate @xmath153 .",
    "additionally , each skeleton point requires the simulation of a coordinate from a bessel(4)- ( bessel - ea1 ) or bessel(3)- ( ea2 ) bridge , requiring four or three random variables respectively .",
    "ea2 suffers an additional one - off cost of 6 random variables in order to simulate @xmath66 .",
    "thus , ea2 requires up to @xmath154 realizations per candidate path ( whether accepted or not ) , while bessel - ea1 requires up to @xmath155 .",
    "the relative performance of the two algorithms therefore depends on three factors : ( i ) @xmath156 , which in turn depends on @xmath157 , the size of the bound on @xmath158 or @xmath73 ; ( ii ) the rejection rate , which depends on the distribution of @xmath159)$ ] [ or @xmath160)$ ] ] ; and ( iii ) the cost of generating each variate . for both algorithms",

    "also notice that , because the distribution function of the extremum of a brownian bridge is known , the general choice of @xmath193 in ( [ eq : lambda ] ) can be computed exactly .",
    "it remains to simulate random indicators for the events @xmath197 ( given @xmath174 ) and @xmath198 ( given @xmath174 and @xmath197 ) , which proceeds as in the symmetric case @xcite .",
    "in this paper i have developed an efficient , exact algorithm for simulating from the law of a diffusion on @xmath199 with a finite entrance boundary at @xmath167 .",
    "the algorithm is applicable when the boundary behaviour is matched by that of a bessel process , which covers a number of interesting examples including conditioned diffusions [ equation ( [ eq : conditioned ] ) ] , the wide - sense bessel process [ equation ( [ eq : besseldriftgen ] ) ] , and a very general model of population growth [ equation ( [ eq : growthgen ] ) ] . in an application to the latter",
    ", it was shown that using the bessel process instead of brownian motion to generate candidate paths gives a striking improvement in efficiency . for a diffusion with two entrance boundaries",
    ", i developed a tractable exact algorithm which uses brownian motion as the candidate process .",
    "there are a number of directions for further research .",
    "perhaps the greatest restriction on the algorithm developed here is assumption ( b * ) , which does not apply if for example the diffusion also has an upper entrance boundary .",
    "we should like to relax ( b * ) to the following :    * @xmath200 .",
    "this is the bessel analogue of ( * * ) , and makes no restrictions on the drift away from @xmath71 . for diffusions satisfying ( * * ) , @xcite tackled the analogous problem by first simulating the maximum of a brownian bridge path together with the time it is attained .",
    "this was possible because these distributions take on a simple form and are easy to simulate .",
    "there are grounds for optimism that we might take a similar approach using the bessel process .",
    "remarkably , the bessel process is one of few well - characterized diffusions for which we also have some results on the distribution of the maximum of its bridge and the time it is attained @xcite . here",
    "though , the relevant distributions are rather more complicated , expressible only in infinite series form . exact simulation from these distributions will be the subject of a future paper .    a further extension of this work would be to handle other types of boundary behaviour .",
    "much of the preceding argument , including proposition  [ prop : mak : gle:2010 ] , continues to hold for @xmath201 , which could then be used in a rejection sampling algorithm for a target diffusion with an instantaneously reflecting boundary .",
    "however , great care must be taken in ensuring the assumptions of the algorithm are met .",
    "in particular we can no long write the radon - nikodm derivative in the form ( [ eq : rdchain ] ) ; moreover , for @xmath202 the bessel process is not even a semimartingale beyond @xmath203 @xcite .",
    "finally , the contributions in this paper illustrate an important concept : that it is possible to implement the exact algorithm using a _ non_-brownian candidate process .",
    "this raises the interesting question : what candidate diffusions _ other than _ brownian motion and the bessel process are available to use in the framework of the exact algorithm ( and when would they be useful ) ?",
