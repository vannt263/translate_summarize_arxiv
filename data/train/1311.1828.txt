    "they have taught us three important things about the real universe .",
    "first , the observed faint end slope of the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) is close to @xmath16 , indicating that fainter galaxies below the current detection limit likely make a significant contribution to the overall ionizing photon budget .",
    "second , it appears that star formation in these systems may have started much earlier @xcite .",
    "third , the stellar mass of detected galaxies is at or above @xmath17 , implying halo masses of @xmath18 at the current detection limit . the standard cosmological constant - dominated cold dark matter model ( lcdm ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predicts that the majority of stars at @xmath19 are in small dwarf galaxies residing in halos of mass @xmath20 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , it seems likely that the candidate galaxies that are currently detected in the hubble ultra deep field and early release science ( ers ) observations at @xmath21 may represent the high end of the galaxy mass spectrum .",
    "can the multi - wavelength predictions of the standard cold dark matter model reproduce the observations ? to answer this question , we have performed panchromatic ( @xmath22 m ) three - dimensional dust radiative transfer calculations on 198 galaxies of stellar mass @xmath0 obtained from an ab initio cosmological adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamic simulation with high resolution ( @xmath1h@xmath2pc ) .",
    "three parameters are used in the radiative transfer calculation : the dust - to - metal ratio , the extinction curve , and the fraction of directly escaped light from stars ( @xmath23 ) . in @xcite",
    "we show that our stellar mass function is in broad agreement with @xcite , independent of the three parameters .",
    "we also show that our simulated galaxies can reasonably and simultaneously match the observed uv - optical color , uv spectral slope and the uv luminosity function , if @xmath24 and a small magellanic cloud ( smc)-type extinction curve is used .",
    "the conclusion that the model with @xmath25 is favored over the model with much smaller @xmath23 is encouraging based on independent considerations .",
    "observations of cosmological reionization infer the thomson optical depth @xmath26 @xcite , indicating a reionization redshift of @xmath27 ( assuming a sudden reionization picture ) . in order to reionize the universe at this redshift range by stellar sources",
    ", @xmath28 would not be viable ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , detailed radiative transfer simulations with still higher resolutions indicate a porous interstellar medium , and @xmath25 is within the range of predictions for galaxies at high redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "one interesting and perhaps not entirely expected property , according to the conventional wisdom , that comes from our calculations is that most of these simulated galaxies are heavily dust - attenuated with extinction of @xmath29 .",
    "this indicates that a significant amount of stellar radiation may be re - processed by dust and seen in the fir .",
    "the questions are then : does the star formation rate ( sfr ) inferred based on the observed optical and uv luminosities nearly account for the total sfr ?",
    "what are their infrared properties that can be checked by upcoming alma observations ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this paper addresses these two questions .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we detail our simulations (  2.1 ) , method of making galaxy catalogs (  2.2 ) and panchromatic three - dimensional dust radiative transfer method (  2.3 ) .",
    "results are presented in  3 .",
    "conclusions are given in  4 .",
    "the cosmological simulation is performed with the eulerian hydrodynamics code , enzo @xcite . for more details on the simulation setup and",
    "implemented physics , the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "we use the following cosmological parameters that are consistent with the wmap7-normalized @xcite @xmath30cdm model : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "these parameters are consistent with those from planck first - year data @xcite if we average planck derived @xmath37 with sn ia and hst based @xmath37 .",
    "first we ran a low resolution simulation with a periodic box of @xmath38mpc ( comoving ) on a side .",
    "we identified a region centered on a cluster of mass of @xmath39 at @xmath40 .",
    "we then resimulate with high resolution of the chosen region embedded in the outer @xmath41mpc box to properly take into account the large - scale tidal field and appropriate boundary conditions at the surface of the refined region .",
    "the refined region has a comoving size of @xmath42mpc@xmath43 and represents @xmath44 matter density fluctuation on that volume .",
    "the dark matter particle mass in the refined region is @xmath45 .",
    "the refined region is surrounded by three layers ( each of @xmath46mpc ) of buffer zones with particle masses successively larger by a factor of @xmath47 for each layer , which then connects with the outer root grid that has a dark matter particle mass @xmath48 times that in the refined region .",
    "we choose the mesh refinement criterion such that the resolution is always better than @xmath1h@xmath2pc ( physical ) , corresponding to a maximum mesh refinement level of @xmath49 at @xmath40 .",
    "the simulations include a metagalactic uv background @xcite where the cosmic reionization occurs at @xmath50 , and a model for shielding of uv radiation @xcite .",
    "they include metallicity - dependent radiative cooling @xcite .",
    "our simulations also solve relevant gas chemistry chains for molecular hydrogen formation @xcite , molecular formation on dust grains @xcite , and metal cooling extended down to @xmath51k @xcite .",
    "star particles are created in cells that satisfy a set of criteria for star formation proposed by @xcite .",
    "each star particle is tagged with its initial mass , creation time , and metallicity ; star particles typically have masses of @xmath52@xmath53 .",
    "supernova feedback from star formation is modeled following @xcite .",
    "feedback energy and ejected metal - enriched mass are distributed into 27 local gas cells centered at the star particle in question , weighted by the specific volume of each cell .",
    "this is to mimic the physical process of supernova blastwave propagation that tends to channel energy , momentum and mass into the least dense regions ( with the least resistance and cooling ) .",
    "the primary advantages of this supernova energy based feedback mechanism are three - fold .",
    "first , nature does drive winds in this way and energy input is realistic .",
    "second , it has only one free parameter @xmath54 , namely , the fraction of the rest mass energy of stars formed that is deposited as thermal energy on the cell scale at the location of supernovae .",
    "third , the processes are treated physically , obeying their respective conservation laws ( where they apply ) , allowing transport of metals , mass , energy and momentum to be treated self - consistently and taking into account relevant heating / cooling processes at all times .",
    "we allow the entire feedback processes to be hydrodynamically coupled to surroundings and subject to relevant physical processes , such as cooling and heating .",
    "the total amount of explosion kinetic energy from type ii supernovae for an amount of star formed @xmath55 with a chabrier initial mass function ( imf ) is @xmath56 ( where @xmath57 is the speed of light ) with @xmath58 .",
    "taking into account the contribution of prompt type i supernovae , we use @xmath59 in our simulations .",
    "observations of local starburst galaxies indicate that nearly all of the star formation produced kinetic energy is used to power galactic superwinds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "supernova feedback is important primarily for regulating star formation and for transporting energy and metals into the intergalactic medium .",
    "the extremely inhomogeneous metal enrichment process demands that both metals and energy ( and momentum ) are correctly modeled so that they are transported in a physically sound ( albeit still approximate at the current resolution ) way .",
    "we identify galaxies in our high resolution simulations using the hop algorithm @xcite , operated on the stellar particles , which is tested to be robust and insensitive to specific choices of concerned parameters within reasonable ranges .",
    "satellites within a galaxy are clearly identified separately .",
    "the luminosity of each stellar particle at each of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) five bands is computed using the gissel stellar synthesis code @xcite , by supplying the formation time , metallicity and stellar mass .",
    "collecting luminosity and other quantities of member stellar particles , gas cells and dark matter particles yields the following physical parameters for each galaxy : position , velocity , total mass , stellar mass , gas mass , mean formation time , mean stellar metallicity , mean gas metallicity , star formation rate , luminosities in five sdss bands ( and various colors ) and others .",
    "we post - process the simulated galaxy sample at @xmath6 using a three - dimensional dust radiation transfer code , sunrise @xcite .",
    "the main strength of the sunrise code is the use of a polychromatic algorithm to trace information in all wavelengths per ray , enabling us to compute the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of each galaxy .",
    "it makes use of the standard dust cross - sections by draine and collaborators @xcite to simulate absorption and multiple scattering by dust . each stellar particle that is basically a coeval star cluster has three attributes - mass ( @xmath60 ) , formation time and metallicity - which are input to the code starburst99 @xcite , assuming a kroupa initial mass function with an upper ( lower ) mass limit of @xmath61 .",
    "the output from starburst99 is the input stellar spectrum to sunrise . in order to take into account the immediate absorption and emission by birth clouds , which large - scale cosmological simulations can not resolve",
    ", sunrise uses the spectra of hii and photo - dissociation regions ( pdrs ) computed by photo - ionization code , mappingsiii @xcite .",
    "this is done by replacing seds of star particles younger than @xmath62 with re - processed seds of a population with constant star formation for 10 myr by mappingsiii ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the fraction of light travelled through the pdr is controlled by a parameter , @xmath63 , which we use @xmath64 following @xcite .",
    "the metal mass in each simulation cell is followed hydrodynamically , including flux , sources ( from stellar feedback ) and sinks ( forming into new stars ) .",
    "the amount of dust is derived from the amount of metals in each hydro cell by using a dust - to - metal ratio ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "while the uv / optical properties depend sensitively on @xmath65 , the fir properties depends on @xmath65 only weakly , as will be shown , making our predictions of fir properties of @xmath6 rather robust , except the peak wavelength of the fir sed ( see figure  [ fig : peak ] below ) .",
    "the dust temperature , emission , and dust opacity is obtained in a self - consistent fashion in sunrise by solving for the thermal equilibrium solution for dust grains at every location , where dust emission cooling is balanced by stellar radiative heating .",
    "this is achieved by iteration computationally .",
    "0.5 cm -1 cm -0 cm -0 cm",
    "-0 cm -1 cm -0 cm -0 cm    we first present in figure  [ fig : galsed ] the sed in the rest - frame and rest - frame fir images of two simulated galaxies of stellar masses of @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively . for each galaxy we show two cases with two different combinations of ( @xmath65 , @xmath23 ) , ( 0.4,0.1 ) ( red ) and ( 0.06,0 ) ( blue ) , which have been both found to reproduce the uv / optical properties of @xmath6 galaxies @xcite .",
    "three points are worth noting .",
    "first , the overall sed shares some of the properties of lower redshift starburst galaxies , in that the majority of the stellar radiation comes out in the fir peak .",
    "second , even though the two galaxies are in the category of starburst galaxies , the higher mass galaxy contains a significant , evolved stellar population , as indicated by a strong balmer break at @xmath68 m ; the lower mass galaxy has a less prominent balmer break , suggesting an overall younger population .",
    "the existence of an evolved population for @xmath3 galaxies is consistent with observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is likely that our simulation has underestimated the star formation rate at progressively higher redshift due to poorer resolutions for smaller objects at higher redshift , hence the evolved population .",
    "third , the wavelength @xmath69 of the fir peak at @xmath70 m suggests a relatively hot emitting dust , due to a combination of relatively high sfr and sub - kpc , compact sizes of the starbursting regions , seen in the images in the right panel .",
    "figure  [ fig : peak ] shows the fir peak wavelength @xmath69 of the sed of the galaxies at @xmath6 as a function of fir luminosity ( left panel ) and stellar mass ( right panel ) . for each galaxy",
    "two cases are shown with two different combinations of ( @xmath65 , @xmath23 ) , ( 0.4,0.1 ) ( red ) and ( 0.06,0 ) ( blue ) .",
    "the distributions of @xmath69 are shown on the right y - axis for the two cases .",
    "two points are noted .",
    "first , at the lower stellar mass ( @xmath71 ) or lower fir luminosity end ( @xmath72 ) , no strong correlation is found between either fir luminosity or stellar mass and @xmath69 , whereas there is some hint that the highest fir luminosity ( @xmath73 ) or highest stellar mass ( @xmath18 ) galaxies tend to occupy the low end of the @xmath69 distribution .",
    "second , for a given simulated galaxy , post - processing it with different dust - to - metal ratios @xmath65 yields significant difference in the @xmath69 distributions .",
    "for the lower @xmath74 case , the median of the @xmath69 distribution is @xmath75 m , compared to @xmath76 m for the case with @xmath77 .",
    "this significant dependence of @xmath69 on @xmath65 may provide a probe of the latter , when the former is observationally obtained . the physical origin for this , in simple terms , is that a lower @xmath65 value gives a lower dust opacity hence a higher interstellar radiation field , which in turn heats up the dust to a higher equilibrium temperature ( balanced by emission cooling , primarily ) .",
    "-0.0 cm -1 cm -0 cm -0 cm    we examine the sizes of simulated @xmath6 galaxies .",
    "we first examine uv sizes .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : re ] shows the effective radius in galex fuv band as a function of fuv magnitude .",
    "we see that the simulated galaxies have somewhat smaller sizes than the observed counterparts in the rest - frame fuv band , although the trend that more uv luminous galaxies have larger sizes is in agreement with observations and there is significant overalap between observations and our simulation .",
    "the red curve with @xmath78 is actually computed not including the 10% directly escaped light , because we are unsure how to best model it without introducing some additional unchecked parameters .",
    "we now turn to fir sizes of simulated @xmath6 galaxies , shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : re ] .",
    "what is striking is that the predicted sizes of @xmath6 galaxies in the fir band are very small , with effective radii being in the range of @xmath79pc proper .",
    "the effective resolution of our simulation is @xmath80pc [ @xmath81 cells , see @xcite ] , which is probably the cause of the size floor seen .",
    "thus , we expect the lower mass galaxies may have effective radii in fir that are smaller than @xmath82pc .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that the sizes in the range @xmath83pc predicted to be real , to the extent that our simulation resolution is adeqaute for resolving them . because the fir emission is primarily a function of the metal density distribution in the simulated galaxies , they are much less prone to attenuation effects and hence are more robust . however , there are possible caveats that the reader should keep in mind",
    ". the central star formation may be dependent on feedback processes from star formation . since the exact strength of stellar feedback depends on an array of factors that each have significant uncertainties , including the initial stellar mass function ( imf ) , supernova feedback prescription used in the simulation , porosity of the interstellar medium in the simulation that may be underestimated , feedback from agn that is not included , etc ,",
    "our best estimate is that the sizes of the simulated galaxies may have been underestimated somewhat presently .",
    "a comparison between our simulated results and upcoming observations will thus shed useful light on both the cosmological model and astrophysics of galaxy formation at high redshift .",
    "-0 cm -0 cm    another way to demonstrate the concentration of star formation in @xmath6 galaxies is to plot the specific star formation rate as a function of fir surface brightness , shown in figure  [ fig : ssfr_sir ] . comparing to the galaxies in the star - forming sequence at moderate redshift ( @xmath84 ) @xcite ,",
    "it is evident that our simulated galaxies at @xmath6 are substantially more star - bursting by a factor of @xmath85 at a fixed surface density .",
    "@xcite also defines a galaxy as `` compact '' if the fir surface brightness ( @xmath86 ) is greater than @xmath87kpc@xmath88 .",
    "this roughly corresponds to galaxies emitting more than 60% of their 13.2 @xmath89 flux in the unresolved central @xmath90 region ( see * ? ? ?",
    "according to the definition , the majority of the simulated galaxies will be classified as compact galaxies .",
    "-0 cm -1 cm -0 cm -0 cm    -0.0 cm -1 cm",
    "-0 cm -0 cm    having examined the seds and sizes , our attention is shifted to the fir radiation output of @xmath6 galaxies relative to their bolometric luminosities .",
    "figure  [ fig : mstar_ir ] shows fir in the range 81000@xmath91 m ( left panel ) and bolometric ( right panel ) luminosities of each galaxy at @xmath6 as a function of the galaxy stellar mass , for two models with ( @xmath65 , @xmath23 ) , ( 0.4,0.1 ) ( red open circles ) and ( 0.06,0 ) ( blue open circles ) .",
    "let us first study the right panel .",
    "it is evident that bolometric luminosity ( i.e. , sfr ) scales with stellar mass substantially sublinearly , @xmath92 with @xmath93 .",
    "we attribute this , primarily , to `` stochasticity '' of star formation , where galaxies with higher specific star formation are in some `` bursting periods '' , while those with relatively lower specific star formation rates presently are in relatively quiet `` patches '' .",
    "this explanation is consistent with the @xmath94dex spread in the bolometric luminosity at a fixed stellar mass .",
    "the relation between fir luminosity and stellar mass ( left panel ) is largely inherited from that of between bolometric luminosity and stellar mass ( right panel ) , with a small correction due to a non - uniform ratio of fir to bolometric luminosities , shown in figure  [ fig : rat ] below .",
    "if confirmed by alma , this will provide significant insight into the galaxy formation process at high redshift .",
    "the expectation is that , with time , galaxies will mature and become stellar mass dominated on the baryon budget , and as such , the overall stochasticity is expected to decline towards lower redshift , resulting in @xmath95 gradually approaching unity .",
    "figure  [ fig : rat ] shows the ratio of fir luminosity in the range @xmath96 to the bolometric luminosity for each galaxy as a function of stellar mass ( left ) and star formation rate ( right ) , for two models with a dust - to - metal ratio ( @xmath65 ) of 0.06 and 0.4 .",
    "it is seen that there is a tendency for less massive galaxies or lower sfr galaxies to have lower median ratios . for galaxies with sfr@xmath97/yr",
    ", it is found that the median fir / bolometric luminosity ratio is in the range of @xmath10 . for galaxies with stellar mass in the range of @xmath98 , the median fir / bolometric luminosity ratio",
    "is predicted to be in the range of @xmath99 .",
    "we expect that targeted observations of current high redshift galaxies at @xmath3 by alma should be able to verify these predictions .",
    "-0 cm    figure  [ fig : irlf ] shows the galaxy fir luminosity function at @xmath6 .",
    "it is seen that the fir luminosity function only depends weakly on the changes of dust properties ; the two dust models that are found to be able to match uv / optical properties of galaxies at @xmath6 are shown to give similar results .",
    "interestingly , for the high end luminosity range probed , @xmath100 , there is no indication of an exponential drop that is normally the case for galaxy stellar mass function or uv / optical luminosity function at high redshift .",
    "we find that a power - law slope of @xmath101 provides a good fit to our simulated fir luminosity functions , where the uncertainty is measured by bootstrap resampling .",
    "this power - law shape is related to the stochasticity of star formation of @xmath6 galaxies , as noted above , which will have significant implications on small - scale power in the standard cold dark matter model as well as the consumption and thermodynamic state of the gas prior to star formation in galaxies at @xmath6 .",
    "it is expected that observing the uv selected high redshift galaxy candidates in the udf by alma may be able to check this expected power - law slope .",
    "it is noted that , since the ratio of fir to bolometric luminosity is close to unity ( see figure  [ fig : rat ] ) , this power - law behavior is rather robust to attentuation uncertainties that plague rest - frame uv luminosity functions , making fir continuum observations by alma especially powerful .",
    "if verified , we will learn a great deal of the mode of star formation in high - z galaxies : how bursty is star formation in high redshift galaxies and what is the dispersion in star formation rate at a fixed halo or stellar mass ?",
    "we perform , in unprecedented details , three - dimensional panchromatic dust radiative transfer calculations on a set of 198 galaxies of stellar masses in the range @xmath0 resolved at @xmath1h@xmath2pc at @xmath3 from an _ ab initio _ cosmological hydrodynamic simulation of the standard cold dark matter model .",
    "the soundness of treatment of relevant physical processes has been checked by comparing to a set of independent observations . in a companion paper @xcite",
    "we show that the uv - optical properties , including stellar mass and luminosity functions , uv - optical and fuv - nuv colors , are in good agreement with observations , if an smc - type dust extinction curve is adopted . in order to make further testable predictions of the same model , we present here , self - consistently , an additional set of infrared continuum properties of these @xmath3 simulated galaxies , to be confronted with upcoming alma data .",
    "the main results may be summarized in four points .",
    "\\(1 ) the effective radius in the restframe mips@xmath4 m band is in the range of @xmath5pc proper for @xmath6 galaxies with @xmath7 , corresponding to an angular size of @xmath102 , which may be resolvable by alma .",
    "the majority of the simulated galaxies would be classified as compact starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "the predicted size would be below the extrapolation from lower redshift evolution in rest - frame uv or visual band ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "( 2 ) the median of the peak wavelength of the fir sed is in the range of @xmath8 m , depending on the dust - to - metal ratio , corresponding to observed wavelength of @xmath103 m , within the alma range .",
    "the peak wavelength found is comparable to local starburst galaxies , such as arp 220 and ngc 6240 .",
    "\\(3 ) for galaxies with sfr in the range @xmath9  yr@xmath2 , the median fir in the range 81000@xmath91 m to bolometric luminosity ratio is @xmath10 . in other words ,",
    "the sfr inferred based on the observed optical and uv luminosities is missing more than one half of the total sfr , on average .",
    "this is a new and key prediction that should be easily verifiable by upcoming alma observations , in conjunction with hst udf data .",
    "\\(4 ) the fir luminosity function displays a power law in the high end with a slope of -3.1@xmath110.4 , instead of the usual exponential decline .",
    "a related result is that @xmath92 with @xmath93 , which is somewhat flatter than the corresponding relation at lower redshifts .",
    "both results may be attributable to  stochasticity \" and significant dispersions in star formation at a given halo mass .",

    "<S> three - dimensional panchromatic dust radiative transfer calculations are performed on a set of 198 galaxies of stellar masses in the range @xmath0 from a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation ( resolved at @xmath1h@xmath2pc ) at @xmath3 . in a companion paper ( kimm & cen ) , the stellar mass and uv luminosity functions , and uv - optical and fuv - nuv colors are shown to be in good agreement with observations , if an smc - type dust extinction curve is adopted . here </S>",
    "<S> we make useful predictions , self - consistently , of the infrared properties of these @xmath3 simulated galaxies that can be confronted with upcoming alma data . </S>",
    "<S> our findings are as follows . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) the effective radius in the restframe mips@xmath4 m band is in the range of @xmath5pc proper for @xmath6 galaxies with @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) the median of the peak wavelength of the far - infrared ( fir ) spectral energy distribution is in the range of @xmath8 m , depending on the dust - to - metal ratio . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) for star formation rate in the range @xmath9  </S>",
    "<S> yr@xmath2 the median fir to bolometric luminosity ratio is @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) the fir luminosity function displays a power law in the high end with a slope of -3.1@xmath110.4 , instead of the usual exponential decline .    </S>",
