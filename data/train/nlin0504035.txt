    "the problem of susceptibility of chaotic systems to perturbations has attracted much attention in the last decade [ 1 - 9 ] .",
    "this problem is fundamental , since it includes the determination of the response of a material system to an imposed external electromagnetic field , the setup that is typical for many experiments .",
    "due to the sensitivity of classical phase trajectories or quantum energy spectra and stationary wavefunctions of chaotic systems to small changes of their parameters , the problem is challengingly difficult . a consistent and noncontroversial picture covering ( albeit qualitatively ) all the essential cases of the response hasnt been yet drawn at present . from the point of view of general theory ,",
    "the problem is related to the applicability of the concept of quantum - classical correspondence to chaotic systems , that is a long - standing question in its own right @xcite .",
    "we shall study a one - particle system with the hamiltonian of the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the hamiltonian of the unperturbed system ; @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the operators of cartesian components of the momentum and of the position of the particle .",
    "the classical system with the hamiltonian function @xmath5 will be assumed to be strongly chaotic , that is , nearly ergodic on the energy surfaces in a wide range of the energy values , system with @xmath6 degrees of freedom . in the perturbation operator @xmath7 the active variable @xmath8",
    "is one of the cartesian coordinates of the particle , coupled to the external homogeneous force field . the amplitude @xmath9 in the following will be referred to as field . in the following",
    "we shall deal with the quasiclassical case , when the planck constant is small in comparison of the action scale of the system @xmath10 .    under the influence of the perturbation the energy value @xmath11 varies in a quasirandom way .",
    "these variations frequently can be described as a process of the energy diffusion @xcite , when for the ensemble with the microcanonical initial energy distribution @xmath12 the dispersion of the energy increases linearly with time , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the energy diffusion coefficient .",
    "if the external field @xmath9 is sufficiently small in comparison with the appropriately averaged values of the forces acting on a particle in the unperturbed system , then in the classical model the energy diffusion coefficient @xmath15 can be expressed through the characteristics of the unperturbed chaotic motion of the active coordinate , namely @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the power spectrum of the active coordinate ( the fourier transform of its autocorrelation function ) for the motion on the surface with the constant energy value @xmath18 [ 9 ] . the same expression ( 1 ) in the case of weak perturbation can be obtained in the classical limit from the quantum model .",
    "the evolution of the quantum system can be treated as a sequence of one - photon transitions between stationary states of the unperturbed system @xmath19 , accompanied with the absorption or emission of the quanta @xmath20 . for small @xmath21",
    "the energy spectrum of @xmath22 is quasicontinuous , thence the rates of transition are given by the fermi golden rule ( fgr ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the matrix element of the active coordinate , and @xmath25 is the density of states near the final state of the transition .",
    "although the matrix elements @xmath24 in quantum chaotic systems fluctuate wildly with the variation of @xmath26 [ 10 , 11 ] , the averaged squared quantity @xmath27 in the limit @xmath28 is smooth ; it is proportional to the power spectrum @xmath29 of the coordinate @xcite , @xmath30 from eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) we have for the transition rate @xmath31 then for the energy dispersion for small @xmath32 we have @xmath33 , that returns us to the eq.(1 ) for the energy diffusion coefficient . it can be shown that the same expression for @xmath15 holds also for large @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the energy absorption in chaotic systems comes as an epiphenomenon of the energy diffusion [ 4 ] . with the account of the dependence on the energy of the power spectrum @xmath34 and the density of states",
    "@xmath35 the diffusion becomes biased , and the energy absorption rate @xmath36 is given by the formula @xcite @xmath37    although for weak fields @xmath15 does not depend on the planck constant @xmath21 , the condition of the applicability of eq .",
    "( 2 ) does .",
    "the fgr is , after all , only a formula of the first order perturbation theory .",
    "it is based on the assumption that the transition process has a resonant character - that the width @xmath38 of the energy distribution of states populated from the original one , given by the weisskopf - wigner formula @xmath39 @xcite , is small in comparison with the quanta energy @xmath20 . from eq .",
    "( 4 ) it is evident that in the classical limit @xmath28 this condition will be violated . in the following",
    "we shall use the border value of the field @xmath40 , defined by the condition @xmath41 , and refer to the domain @xmath42 as the range of the strong field .    by analogy with other models , for strong fields one can expect a slow - down of the growth of the energy diffusion coefficient @xmath15 and of the energy absorption rate @xmath36 .",
    "for example , for a two - level system with relaxation the quadratic dependence the absorption rate @xmath43 for small field turns into a field - independent value @xmath44 for strong one .",
    "the border is determined by the condition @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the rabi frequency and @xmath47 are longitudinal and transversal relaxation rates correspondingly @xcite .",
    "the rate of transitions from discrete to continuous energy spectrum ( that are basically covariant with the energy absorption rate @xmath36 ) , studied in the context of the theory of photoionization , for sufficiently strong fields can even decrease with the increase of @xmath9 - the effect that is known as atom stabilization by the strong field @xcite .    for our model we can describe the slow - down by a simple estimate . assuming the exponential decay of the initially populated state and using the weisskopf - wigner formula for the energy distribution of the final states [ 16 ]",
    ", we can rewrite the expression for the rate of the transitions ( with the absorption of quanta ) in the form @xmath48 } \\,\\rho \\left ( \\omega   \\right)d\\omega,\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is a matrix element of perturbation taken as a function of the transition frequency and @xmath50 . in the weak field",
    "the expression in square brackets turns into the @xmath51 - function , and eq .",
    "( 6 ) returns the usual fgr . however , if we dare to use eq .",
    "( 6 ) as an equation that is valid for any magnitude of the perturbation , then in the case of strong fields we will have @xmath52 the rate of transitions @xmath53 , and , consequently , the energy diffusion coefficient @xmath15 and the energy absorption rate @xmath36 , become proportional to the magnitude of perturbation @xmath9 and to the square root of the density of states .",
    "this derivation of eq .",
    "( 7 ) is too risky - but in the following sections this conclusion will be put on a more solid footing .",
    "the slow - down of the energy diffusion in quantum chaotic systems in strong harmonic fields has been first demonstrated by cohen and kottos @xcite . however , their analytical estimates and data of numerical experiments are in quantitative disagreement with the results of the present paper .",
    "lastly , it must be noted that the strong field regime is easily attainable to experiments .",
    "for example , for the excitation of multiatomic molecules with the infrared laser radiation the border field corresponds to the intensity value @xmath54 , that has been reached in experiments long time ago @xcite .",
    "for the system with the hamiltonian @xmath55 we take the wave function in the form of the expansion in the basis of stationary @xmath56 states of @xmath22 , @xmath57 then for the amplitudes @xmath58 we obtain the system of equations @xmath59 where the quantities @xmath60 are the rabi frequencies of transitions .",
    "we shall use the initial conditions @xmath61 : at the initial moment only one of stationary states , @xmath62 , is populated .",
    "following @xcite , we shall assume that @xmath24 are independent random gaussian variables with zero mean value and the dispersion , given by eq .",
    "the system of equations ( 9 ) will be treated as a member of the corresponding statistical ensemble .",
    "we are going to concentrate on the process of the energy diffusion .",
    "then in the zeroth approximation we can restrict ourselves by consideration of the evolution of probability density in a narrow energy range around the initial state and use the power spectrum and the density of states values at this energy : @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "for the calculation of the absorption coefficient the global dependence on the energy must be restituted .",
    "the power spectrum @xmath65 has the symmetry property @xmath66 . the dependence @xmath65 in the domain @xmath67 in typical strongly chaotic systems , such as nonlinear oscillators [ 20 ] and billiards [ 21 , 22 ] , has the form of an asymmetric peak .",
    "we shall define the peak value of the rabi frequency simply as @xmath46 , the frequency of the maximum as @xmath68 and the characteristic width of the peak as @xmath69 .",
    "typically the ratio @xmath70 is about few units .",
    "right after the switching on the perturbation all amplitudes ( but that of the initially populated state ) grows in absolute value linearly in time . at this ballistic stage",
    "the energy dispersion grows quadratically in time : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a numerical constant .",
    "this stage is limited by the depletion of the initial population and lasts until the depletion time @xmath73 . at this time",
    "considerably populated levels are spread over the energy range @xmath74 that contains many levels ( since @xmath75 with @xmath6 ) .",
    "we shall expect that at the next stage the ensemble averaged density of probability is a smooth function with a characteristic scale @xmath76 .",
    "it is convenient to write indices in eq .",
    "( 9 ) as arguments of functions .",
    "we shall use the frequency distance from the initial level as a basic independent variable @xmath77 , @xmath78 will be denoted as @xmath79 , where @xmath80 .",
    "dummy variables @xmath81 and @xmath82 will have the same meaning . by formal integration of eq . ( 9 ) and subsequent recurrent substitution we obtain the equation for the rate of change of the local probability density @xmath83 :    @xmath84    summation in this formula goes over discrete values of @xmath81 and @xmath82 , and this equation is still exact .    now we assume , that the amplitudes @xmath85 are random processes , that are not correlated for different states : @xmath86 . then for the averaged probability density we can retain in the eq . (",
    "11 ) only diagonal terms : @xmath87    with the assumption that the averaged @xmath88 is a smooth function of @xmath89 , and slowly varying function of @xmath32 , we may cast the product of amplitudes in the form @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the normalized ( @xmath92 ) autocorrelation function of the probability amplitudes .    by replacing the averaged square rabi frequency by its value from eq .",
    "( 3 ) ( that depends only on the difference @xmath93 ) , substituting the summation over the states by the integration weighted with the density of states , and averaging over the time intervals that are much larger than the field period , we come to the equation @xmath94 from now we drop the angular brackets and deal only with ensemble averaged quantities",
    ". if the rate of variations of @xmath95 is small in comparison with the decay of correlations of amplitudes given by @xmath91 , then we can treat eq .",
    "( 13 ) as summation over the probability flow that comes from the different parts of the frequency range with the constant rate , @xmath96 this approximate expression to some extent replaces the fermi golden rule for strong perturbations .    to construct the kinetic equation one must take into account both incoming and outgoing flows of probability . by taking into account the total probability flow , expanding @xmath97 in the taylor series",
    ", we obtain a diffusion equation with the probability diffusion coefficient in the energy scale @xmath98 where @xmath99    now the problem reduces to the calculation of the integral @xmath100 . for large enough times the average probability density ,",
    "that is governed by the diffusion equation , varies slowly , and we can treat the system eq .",
    "( 9 ) as a set of equations in which all @xmath101 are non - correlated random processes with the same statistical properties .",
    "then by averaging the equation for the squared time derivative of an amplitude , we obtain the expression for the mean squared frequency of these processes , that also gives the estimate for the square of the correlation decay rate @xmath102 : @xmath103    from eq . ( 18 ) for the decay correlation rate we have the estimate @xmath104 where @xmath105 is a numerical constant in the domain of strong field the autocorrelation function is the fastest component under the integration sign in eq . ( 17 ) .",
    "then we have @xmath106 . by the substitution of this expression into eq .",
    "( 16 ) we obtain the estimate of the energy diffusion coefficient : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is a numerical constant ; this expression agrees with the dependence that was derived in sec . 1 .",
    "one must recall that this expression is valid only for the nearly resonant perturbation frequency ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "we do not enter here into the studies of the dependence of @xmath15 on the perturbation frequency @xmath110 in the wider domain , postponing it for the further studies .",
    "to check the analytical results of the preceding section , the system of equations ( 9 ) has been integrated numerically . the number of equations varied from @xmath111 to @xmath112 with the purpose to suppress the influence of the border .",
