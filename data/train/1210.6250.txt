    "modern methods for stretching single molecules provide a valuable insight about the response of polymers to external forces .",
    "the interest on single molecules loading encouraged new research and technological developments on related mechanical experiments .",
    "typically , mechanical methods allow the manipulation of a polymer molecule in two ways : the stretching of the chain by the direct action of an external force or by the application of an external field .",
    "if we consider homogeneous polymers ( with all monomers described by the same effective elastic stiffness ) , then we obtain a uniform strain with the external force and a non - uniform strain with the applied field .",
    "to exert an external force on a polymer fixed at one end , laser optical tweezers ( lots)@xcite , magnetic tweezers ( mts)@xcite or atomic force microscope ( afm)@xcite can be used .",
    "many experiments have been performed over a wide class of polymers with biological relevance , such as the nucleic acids ( dna , rna)@xcite , allowing the stretching of the entire molecule and providing the reading and the mapping of genetic information along the chain.@xcite furthermore , it has been possible to describe the elastic behaviour of single polymers consisting of domains which may exhibit transitions between different stable states.@xcite other investigations performed on double - stranded dna determined the extension of the polymer as a function of the applied force@xcite , providing results in very good agreement with the worm - like chain ( wlc ) model@xcite and the freely - jointed chain ( fjc ) model.@xcite    alternatively , it is possible to manipulate single molecules by an external field . in this case",
    "the external field acts on the molecules from a distance or , in other words , without a defined contact point for applying the traction . a non - uniform stretching performed by an external field can be induced either via a hydrodynamic ( or electrohydrodynamic ) flow field@xcite or via an electric ( or magnetic ) field.@xcite one experimental advantage of using flow fields is that the liquid surrounding the tethered molecule can be easily replaced ; this is indeed an important feature for many single - molecules studies of enzymes which require varying buffer conditions.@xcite the flow field technique was extensively applied in single - molecule study of dna elasticity@xcite as well as to characterize the rheological properties of individual dna molecules.@xcite the use of an electric field has been adopted for driving the alignment of dna on a solid surface for applications such as gene mapping and restriction analysis.@xcite finally , magnetic fields have been used to apply torsional stress to individual dna molecules.@xcite    in order to understand the response of polymers to external fields and to study their statistics , some theoretical models have been proposed .",
    "these models are typically based on the fjc and wlc schemes , generalized with the inclusion of the given applied field .",
    "some studies have shown that in a weak external field the persistence length along the field direction is increased , while it is decreased in the perpendicular direction ; moreover , as the external field becomes stronger , the effective persistence length grows exponentially with the field strength.@xcite other investigations under a constant velocity flow have shown that a flexible polymer displays three types of conformation : unperturbed at low velocity ; `` trumpet '' shaped when partially stretched ; `` stem and flowers '' shaped , with a completely stretched portion ( the stem ) and a series of blobs ( the flowers ) , at larger loading.@xcite polymer models have been studied in elongational flows to analyze the coil stretching and chain retraction as a function of polymer and flow parameters , finding good agreement with experimental data.@xcite conformational properties of semiflexible polymer chains in uniform force field were also studied for two - dimensional models.@xcite in spite of all these relevant efforts , it is yet a challenge to base on one same unified theoretical framework and understanding of all aspects of polymer mechanics in an external field .",
    "building on our previous studies,@xcite in this paper we study the conformational and mechanical properties of flexible and semi - flexible non - branched polymer model chains tethered at one end and immersed in an external force field .",
    "this situation is useful to describe almost two physical conditions of interest : a polymer chain immersed in a fluid in a uniform motion ( our model is valid only when the action of the fluid motion can be described by a distribution of given forces applied to all monomers ) and an arbitrarily charged chain inserted in a uniform electric field .    our theoretical approach is twofold , since we adopt both analytical ( statistical mechanics@xcite ) and numerical techniques ( monte carlo simulations@xcite ) .",
    "while the analytical approach is useful to obtain the explicit partition function in some specific cases , monte carlo simulations are crucial to study more generic cases , inaccessible to analytical treatments . in particular , while we develop our theoretical framework starting from the more tractable fjc model , we take full profit from our mc simulations to extend our study also to the wlc model .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following . in section",
    "ii we introduce the mathematical formalism adopted and we derive a generic form of the partition function in @xmath0 for a generalized fjc model where the extensibility of the bonds is taken into account . in the section iii",
    "we find the two specific forms of the partition function for the 2d- and the 3d - case for the pure fjc polymer with non extensible bonds .",
    "moreover , we obtain in both cases the variance and the covariance among the positions of the monomers . in the section",
    "iv we present the generalization of previous results to the semi - flexible wlc model .",
    "we present two closed - forms approximations for the 2d- and the 3d - case and the comparisons with mc simulations . in section",
    "v we analyze the behavior of a chain in an external field to which also an external force is applied at the end of the chain . the case with",
    "the force not aligned with the field is particularly interesting and shows the power of the mc method .",
    "finally , in section vi some conclusions are drawn .",
    "as previously discussed , the polymer models most used in literature are the fjc and the wlc . as argued in ref .",
    ", for weak tension and weak external field , it is acceptable to model the polymer as a fjc model .",
    "this model breaks down only when the curvature of the conformation is very large because it ignores the consequent great bending energy . since we will look upon this problem in the end of this work , we now give way to the case of a fjc .",
    "in particular we consider a fjc with two additional hypothesis .",
    "firstly we consider the possible extensibility of the bonds of the chain through a standard quadratic potential characterized by a given equilibrium length : such an extension mimics the possible stretching of the chemical bond between two adjacent monomers .",
    "if necessary , the extensibility of the bonds , here described by linear springs , can be easily extended to more complex , nonlinear springs.@xcite moreover , we take into account a series of arbitrary forces applied to each monomer : these actions mimic the effects of an external physical field applied to the system .",
    "in addition , we contemplate the presence of an arbitrary force applied to the terminal monomer of the chain .",
    "all calculations will be performed in @xmath0 and we will specialize the results both in the 2d - case and in the 3d - case when needed .",
    "the idea is to write the complete form of the hamiltonian of the system and to build up the corresponding statistical mechanics.@xcite the starting point is therefore the calculation of the classical partition function .",
    "in fact , when this quantity is determined , it is possible to obtain the force - extension curve ( the equation of state ) through simple derivations .",
    "let us consider a non - branched linear polymer with @xmath1 monomers ( see fig .",
    "[ polymer_model ] ) at positions defined by @xmath2 ( for considering @xmath3 or @xmath4 according to the specific problem of interest ) . to each monomer",
    "a given external force is applied and named @xmath5 .",
    "another external force , playing the role of main pulling load , @xmath6 , is applied to the last monomer at the position @xmath7 . while the chain is clamped at position @xmath8 ,",
    "the monomers are free to fluctuate .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is therefore given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the linear momenta , @xmath11 the mass of the monomers , @xmath12 the spring constant of the inter - monomer interaction , and @xmath13 the equilibrium length of the monomer - monomer bond .",
    "we search for the partition function of the system defined as : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a multiplicative constant which takes into account the number of microstates . as well known , the kinetic part can be straightforwardly integrated and it yields a further non - influencing multiplicative constant ; then we can write the partition function as an integral over the positional space only .",
    "this integral can be easily handled through the standard change of variable @xmath16 having the jacobian determinant @xmath17 .",
    "we consider the terminal @xmath8 of the chain fixed in the origin of axes , i.e. @xmath18 .",
    "so , we cast the positions @xmath19 in terms of the variables @xmath20 as follows @xmath21 by setting the general solution as @xmath22 , the partition function becomes @xmath23 \\\\ \\nonumber & & \\times \\exp \\left [ \\frac{1}{k_bt}\\sum_{k=1}^{n } \\vec g_k \\cdot \\sum_{j=1}^{k } \\vec \\xi_j \\right]\\\\ \\nonumber & & \\times \\exp \\left [ \\frac{1}{k_bt } \\vec f \\cdot \\sum_{k=1}^{n } \\vec \\xi_k \\right ]   d\\vec \\xi_1 ... d\\vec \\xi_n\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] inverting the two summation symbols @xmath24 we obtain @xmath25 where @xmath26 it exists a deep conceptual connection between the last integral for the partition function and the theory of the @xmath27-dimensional fourier transforms .",
    "the fourier integral of an arbitrary function @xmath28 is defined as @xmath29 with inverse transform given by @xmath30 if we consider @xmath31 it is easy to realize that the integral in eq.([partition1 ] ) is the fourier transform of @xmath28 calculated for @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath33 with @xmath34 e @xmath35 defined respectively in eq.([partval1 ] ) and eq.([partval2 ] ) .",
    "it is important to remark that the function in eq.([function ] ) has a spherical symmetry ( i.e. it depends only on the length of the vector @xmath36 ) and , therefore , also its fourier transform @xmath37 exhibits the spherical symmetry , depending only on the quantity @xmath38 in the transformed domain . in fact , for such spherically - symmetric functions it holds that : if @xmath39 then @xmath40 .",
    "furthermore , we have that @xmath41 for @xmath42 , and @xmath43 for @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46.@xcite here @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the cylindrical and spherical bessel functions of the first kind respectively , correlated by the standard relation @xmath49.@xcite in our calculations we have to set @xmath32 and , therefore , we obtain @xmath50 .",
    "moreover , when the argument of @xmath47 and @xmath48 is supposed imaginary we obtain the modified bessel functions of the first kind@xcite @xmath51 for example we have the explicit expression @xmath52 and @xmath53 while , on the contrary , @xmath54 and @xmath55 can not be written in closed form .",
    "so , for @xmath27 even we eventually obtain @xmath56 and , on the other hand , for @xmath27 odd we have @xmath57 finally , by using eq.([partfourier ] ) , the partition function is given by @xmath58 for @xmath27 even , and @xmath59 for @xmath27 odd , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are given in eqs.([partval1 ] ) and ( [ partval2 ] ) . in the framework of statistical mechanics ,",
    "the knowledge of the partition function allows to determine all needed expected values describing the statistics of the chain ( i.e. , average values of the positions , variances of the positions and so on ) .",
    "in the previous section we obtained the general expression of the partition function for the case where the extensibility of the bonds is taken into account .",
    "this is described by the parameter @xmath12 , which characterizes the elastic bond between adjacent monomers . in the present section",
    "we want to study the effects of an arbitrary distribution of forces on a pure freely jointed chain model ( fjc ) .",
    "therefore we need to obtain the specific form of the partition function in the case of rigid bonds of fixed length @xmath13 . from the mathematical point of view",
    "it means that we will consider @xmath62 , a condition representing a inextensible spring . because of the relation @xmath63 when @xmath64 we may determine the limit of eq.([partition_even ] ) and eq.([partition_odd ] ) for @xmath65 ( i.e. for @xmath62 , fjc limit ) . since the arbitrariness of the constant @xmath15",
    ", we may consider in eqs .",
    "( [ partition_even ] ) and ( [ partition_odd ] ) a multiplicative constant term @xmath66 .",
    "then , by using the translated property @xmath67 for @xmath65 we perform all the integrals thereby obtaining @xmath68 @xmath69 in particular , for @xmath3 we have @xmath70 while for @xmath71 we obtain @xmath72 all the expressions given in eqs.([partition_even2 ] ) , ( [ partition_odd2 ] ) , ( [ partition_d2 ] ) , ( [ partition_d3 ] ) can be summarized in the general form @xmath73 with a suitable function @xmath74 . by using this expression of the partition function",
    "we can find the average position of the @xmath75-th monomer of the chain ; indeed , from the definition of the hamiltonian in eq.([hamiltonian ] ) we state that @xmath76 and , therefore , we get @xmath77 which represents the shape of the polymer chain under the effects of the external field @xmath78 and the applied force @xmath6 .",
    "now we can substitute eq.([partition_general ] ) into eq.([shape ] ) , obtaining @xmath79_{x=|\\vec v_k|}\\ ] ] in 2d we have @xmath80 and therefore we obtain @xmath81 for such a 2d case , by applying eq.([2dcampo ] ) , the average values of the longitudinal component of the positions have been calculated and are plotted in fig.[positions_2d ] as a function of the chain length @xmath1 and the field strength @xmath82 .",
    "we have considered only the action of an external uniform field with @xmath83 and amplitude @xmath82 .",
    "although this case lends itself to a full analytical solution , numerical simulations were also performed by using a conventional implementation of the metropolis version of the monte carlo algorithm.@xcite the initial state of the chain is defined by a set of randomly chosen positions .",
    "the displacement extent of each step governs the efficiency of the configurational space sampling .",
    "therefore , we analysed several runs in order to optimize its value.@xcite the perfect agreement between the theory and the mc simulations provides a strict check of the numerical procedure , to be used in the foregoing .    on the other hand , in 3d we have @xmath84 , leading to @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the langevin function . by using eq.([3dcampo ] ) , as before , it is possible to plot the average values of the longitudinal component of the positions for the 3d case ( fig.[positions_3d ] ) .",
    "also in this case we adopted a uniform field @xmath82 and the good agreement with the mc simulations is evident .",
    "+     +    as particular case , if there is only the force @xmath87 applied to the system we obtain the standard scalar force - extension curves linking @xmath88 with @xmath89 . in 2d",
    "we have @xmath90 in agreement with recent results,@xcite while in 3d we obtain @xmath91 which is a classical result.@xcite the simple results in eqs.([fjc2df ] ) and ( [ fjc3df ] ) have been used to obtain the limiting behaviors under low ( @xmath92 ) and high ( @xmath93 ) values of the applied force , as shown in table [ asym ] .    building on such first results we now focus on some particular interesting approximations .",
    "more specifically , it can be interesting to find approximate results for the case of a homogeneous field and no end - force , @xmath94 and @xmath83 for any @xmath95 . in this case",
    "we search for the scalar relation between @xmath88 and @xmath96 . in the 2d case , from eq.([2dcampo ] ) , we have @xmath97 on the other hand , for the 3d case we obtain @xmath98 we have usefully exploited the fact that , for large @xmath1 , the sums can be approximately substituted with the corresponding integrals , which are easier to be handled .",
    "the closed - form expressions given in eqs.([fjc2dg ] ) and ( [ fjc3dg ] ) are very useful to obtain the limiting behaviors of the polymer under low ( @xmath99 ) and high ( @xmath100 ) values of the applied field , as shown in table [ asym ] .",
    "moreover , we have verified the validity of eqs.([fjc2dg ] ) and ( [ fjc3dg ] ) through a series of comparisons with mc results ( see fig.[forcextension_fjc ] in the next section for details ) .      in this section",
    ", we search for the covariance among the positions of the monomers .",
    "it is important to evaluate such a quantity in order to estimate the variance of a given position ( measuring the width of the probability density around its average value ) and the correlation among different monomer positions ( measuring the persistence of some geometrical features along the chain ) . in order to do this ,",
    "we identify the @xmath101-th component of the @xmath75-th monomer as @xmath102 .",

    "being @xmath110 and @xmath111 after long but straightforward calculations we obtain @xmath112 ordering the terms we finally obtain the important result @xmath113 it represents the final form of the covariance between two different components of the positions of two different monomers .    if we look at the variance of a single component of a single position ( @xmath114 , @xmath115 ) we have the simpler result @xmath116 in order to use the previous expressions we have to specify the function @xmath117 and its derivatives for the two - dimensional and the three - dimensional case . in the 2d case we have @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 $ ] .",
    "on the other hand , for the 3d case we have @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "this completes the determination of the covariance .",
    "+     +    we report in fig.[variances_3d_n ] and fig.[variances_3d_gamp ] the longitudinal and transversal component of the variance as a function of the chain length and the field strength for the 3d case ( with @xmath124 ) .",
    "the 2d case is very similar and it has not been reported here for sake of brevity .",
    "we can observe some interesting trends : the longitudinal variance of the position is a decreasing function of the number of polymers @xmath1 while the transversal one is a increasing function ( with a fixed amplitude of the external field @xmath82 ) .",
    "moreover , both variances are rapidly increasing along the chain , assuming the largest value in the last free monomer , which is more subject to strong fluctuations .",
    "it interesting to observe that the variance ( both longitudinal and transversal components ) is a linear function of the position @xmath75 along the chain ( it linearly intensifies along the chain itself ) with a simple force @xmath117 applied at the free end : conversely , with a uniform field @xmath82 , the distribution of forces generates a strongly non - linear intensification of the variances moving towards the free end - terminal .",
    "so , from the point of view of the variances , the application of a field or the application of a single force generates completely different responses . in fig.[variances_3d_gamp",
    "] we can also observe that the variances are decreasing functions of the strength of the field ( both for the longitudinal and transversal components ) ; in fact , the intensity of the fields tends to reduce the fluctuations of the chain , increasing , at the same time , the tension within the bonds .",
    "in previous sections we treated systems described by the fjc model , characterized by the complete flexibility of the chain and , therefore , by the absence of any bending contribution to the total energy . nevertheless , in many polymer chains , especially of biological origin , the specific flexibility ( described by the so - called persistence length@xcite ) has a relevant role in several bio - mechanical processes . in order to take into consideration these important features , with relevant applications to bio - molecules and bio - structures , in this section",
    "we introduce the semi - flexible polymer chain characterized by a given bending energy added to the previous hamiltonian @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the bending stiffness , @xmath127 is the stretching modulus and @xmath128 is the unit vector collinear with the @xmath75-th bond ( see ref . for details ) . in particular we take into consideration the classical wlc model , describing an inextensible semi - flexible chain : it means that the spring constant @xmath127 is set to a very large value ( ideally @xmath129 ) so that the bond lengths remain fixed at the value @xmath13 .",
    "it is well known that it is not possible to calculate the partition functions in closed form for the wlc polymers .",
    "nevertheless , some standard approximations exist for such cases leading to simple expressions for the force - extension curves when a single force @xmath117 is applied to one end of the chain . in the following , starting from these results , we search for the force - extension curves when the polymers is stretched through a constant field @xmath82 .",

    "+    it is interesting to compare the very different force - extension curves for a single molecule in the two cases of a uniform ( only @xmath117 applied ) and non - uniform ( only @xmath82 applied ) stretch . in particular , taking advantage of our approximated formulas , we can analyse the case of a fjc and a wlc polymer . the 2d and 3d fjc results are plotted in fig.[forcextension_fjc ] ; on the other hand , the 2d and 3d wlc curves have been shown in fig.[forcextension_wlc ] . for the wlc case we assumed @xmath176 for the bending modulus at @xmath177k .",
    "this value is comparable to that of polymer chains of biological interest ( e.g. , for dna @xmath178).@xcite in any case three curves have been reported for drawing all the possible comparisons : the response under the field @xmath82 , the response under the force @xmath179 and , finally , the response to an external force @xmath180 .",
    "interesting enough we note that the curve corresponding to the field @xmath82 is always comprised between the cases with only the force @xmath179 and @xmath180 . the response with the field @xmath82 is clearly larger than that with the single force @xmath179 since the field corresponds to a distribution of @xmath1 forces ( of intensity @xmath117 ) applied to all monomers ; therefore , the total force applied is larger , generating a more intense effect .",
    "however , the case with a single force @xmath180 shows a response larger than that of the field @xmath82 . in this case",
    "the total force applied in the two cases is the same but the single force @xmath181 is applied entirely to the last terminal monomer , generating an overall stronger effect compared to the same force evenly distributed on the monomers .",
    "in fact , a force generates a stronger effect if it is placed in the region near the free polymer end ( its effect is redistributed also to all preceding bonds ) .",
    "the curves in fig.[forcextension_fjc ] and fig.[forcextension_wlc ] have been obtained with the theoretical formulations presented in this section and confirmed by a series of mc simulations . in all case",
    "we obtained a quite perfect agreement between the two formulations .",
    "the knowledge of the closed - form expressions allowed us to analytically analyze the behavior of the chains for very low and very high applied forces ( or fields ) .",
    "the results are shown in table [ asym ] : interestingly , we note that the extension is always a linear function of the small applied perturbation .",
    "nevertheless , the corresponding constant of proportionality depends on @xmath1 only when a field is applied to the chain ; conversely , it is independent of @xmath1 with a single force applied at one end . on the other hand , with a large perturbation applied to the molecule",
    ", we observe a @xmath182 behavior for the fjc models and a @xmath183 behavior for the wlc models .",
    "to conclude we also remark that the order of the curves observed in fig.[forcextension_fjc ] and fig.[forcextension_wlc ] is confirmed also in the low and high force ( or field ) regime by the following inequalities : @xmath184 ( low force regime ) and @xmath185 ( high force regime ) for the fjc model and @xmath184 ( low force regime ) and @xmath186 ( high force regime ) for the wlc model ( always for @xmath187 ) .",
    "in previous sections we considered the polymer chain immersed in an external field with an external force equal to zero at its end .",
    "however , since we developed a form of the partition function also taking into account an external force applied at the end of the chain ( at least for the fjc model ) , we can directly study the important case with a non zero force superimposed to an external field , in general having different orientation . to do this , we keep fixed the origin of the chain and apply a constant force at the end of the polymer with different angles with respect to the direction of the applied field .",
    "we will analyse such a problem for both the fjc and wlc cases .    to begin , we consider a pulling force perpendicular to the direction of the applied field , respectively the @xmath188 and @xmath189 axis of our reference frame . for increasing values of the bending spring constant @xmath126 going from nearly zero ( fjc model ) to @xmath190 nm ( wlc model , including the bending constant of the dna given by @xmath191 nm @xmath192 ) .",
    "in fig.[tang ] we reported the results for the average monomers positions and their variances .",
    "the red solid lines correspond to the analytical results for the fjc case , while the black symbols correspond to the mc simulations .",
    "it is interesting to observe the effect of the persistence length ( or , equivalently of the bending stiffness ) : in fact , in the top panel of fig.[tang ] we note that the chains with an higher bending spring constant tend to remain more straight under the same applied load . at the same time , in the fourth panel of fig.[tang ] we observe a decreasing variance along the @xmath189-axis ( direction of the applied field ) with an increasing bending spring constant ; this fact can be easily interpreted observing that an higher rigidity of the chain reduces the statistical fluctuations in the direction of the applied field .",
    "the situation is more complicated for the variances along the @xmath193 and @xmath188 directions : in fact , along the chain , there are some monomers with variances larger than the corresponding fjc case and others with smaller values .    in fig.[pos_3d_bending ] the average positions of the monomers for different directions of the external force",
    "are reported .",
    "the figure shows how the average monomer positions depend on the bending rigidity @xmath126 and on the external force angle @xmath194 . as before we can observe that the persistence length of the chain tends to maintain a low curvature in the shape of the chain .",
    "this phenomenon is more evident with an increasing angle between the force and the field .",
    "in fact , in fig.[pos_3d_bending ] , the deviation between the fjc results and the wlc ones is higher for the angles approaching @xmath195 , where the force and the field are applied in opposite directions .    in figs.[var - fjc ] and [ var - wlc ] the three components of the variance",
    "are reported versus the position of the monomer along the chain and the angle between the field and the force directions , for the fjc and wlc case , respectively .",
    "we can extract some general rules about this very complex scenario : as for the variance along the @xmath193 direction we observe it to be an increasing function both of the position @xmath75 along the chain an of the angle @xmath194 between @xmath117 and @xmath82 .",
    "both behaviors can be interpreted with the concept of persistence length , as discussed above .",
    "conversely , the description of the variance along the @xmath188 direction is more complicated .",
    "in fact , while the increasing trend of the variance with the position @xmath75 along the chain is maintained , we observe a non monotonic behavior in terms of the angle @xmath194 , with a minimum of the variance at about @xmath196 . finally , the variance along the @xmath189 direction is always increasing along the chain , but it shows a maximum near @xmath197 ( at least in the first part of the polymer chain ) .",
    "in this work we investigated mechanical and conformational properties of flexible and semi - flexible polymer chains in external fields . as for the fjc model we developed a statistical theory , based on the exact analytical determination of the partition function , which generalizes previous results to the case where an external field is applied to the system .",
    "in particular we obtained closed form expression for both the average conformation of the chain and its covariance distribution .",
    "for sake of completeness , all calculations have been performed both in two - dimensional and three - dimensional geometry . on the other hand , as for the wlc model we derived new approximate expressions describing the force - extension curve under the effect of an external field .",
    "they can be considered as the extensions of the classical marko - siggia relationships describing the polymer pulled by a single external force applied at the free end of the chain .",
    "all our analytical results , for both fjc and wlc models , have been confirmed by a series of monte carlo simulations , always found in very good agreement with the theory .",
    "the overall effects generated on the tethered polymer by the application of an external field can be summarized as follows . as for the average configuration of a chain",
    ", it is well known that a single pulling force generates a uniform deformation along the chain ( for a homogeneous polymer with all monomers described by the same effective elastic stiffness ) . on the contrary",
    ", the application of an external field produces a non uniform deformation along the chain , showing a larger deformation in the portion of the chain closest to the fixed end .",
    "moreover , the variances of the positions increase linearly along the chain with a single force applied to the polymer .",
    "conversely , the polymer subjected to an external field exhibits a non - linearly increasing behavior of the variances along the chain .",
    "more specifically the variances assume the largest values nearby the last free monomers , where we can measure the highest fluctuations .    to conclude , we underline that the use of the mc method , once validated against known analytical solutions , is crucial for analysing models conditions which are beyond reach of a full analytical calculation .",
    "we take full profit of this approach for analysing the effects of the combination of an applied force at the free end together with an external field , especially when the two are not aligned .",
    "we have analysed the average configurational properties of the polymer , observing a very complex scenario concerning the behavior of the variances .",
