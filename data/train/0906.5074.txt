    "the problem of coherent multiple scattering of waves has long been of great interest in physics and , in particular , in optics .",

    ".    in the problems to be discussed here , complexity in wave scattering derives from the chaotic nature of the underlying classical dynamics .",
    "our discussion will find applications to problems like : i ) electronic transport in microstructures called ballistic quantum dots , and ii ) transport of electromagnetic waves , or other classical waves ( like elastic waves ) , through cavities with a chaotic classical dynamics . in particular , we shall study the statistical fluctuations of transmission and reflection of waves , which are of considerable interest in mesoscopic physics .",

    "the statistical theory of nuclear reactions has been of great interest for many years , in those cases where , due to the presence of many resonances , the cross section is so complicated as a function of energy that its detailed structure is of little interest and a statistical treatments is then called for .",
    "most remarkably , one finds similar statistical properties in the quantum - mechanical scattering of  simple \" one - particle systems like a particle scattering from a cavity whose classical dynamics is chaotic .",
    "the typical dimensions of the ballistic quantum dots that were mentioned above is 1 @xmath3 m , while those of microwave cavities is of the order of 0.5 meters .",
    "thus the size of these systems spans @xmath4 orders of magnitude !    the purpose of this contribution is to review past and recent work in which various ideas that were originally developed in the framework of nuclear physics , like the nuclear optical model and the statistical theory of nuclear reactions @xcite , have been used to give a unified treatment of quantum - mechanical scattering in simple one - particle systems in which the corresponding classical dynamics is chaotic , and of microwave propagation through similar cavities ( see ref . @xcite and references contained therein ) .",
    "the most remarkable feature that we shall encounter is the statistical regularity of the results , in the sense that they will be expressible in terms of a few relevant physical parameters , the remaining details being just  scaffoldings \" .",
    "this feature will be captured within a framework that we shall call the  maximum - entropy approach \" .    in the next section we present some general physical ideas related to scattering of microwaves by cavities and of electrons by ballistic quantum dots .",

    "one given point inside the system receives the contributions from many _ multiply scattered waves _ that have bounced from the inner surface of the cavity , giving rise to the complex interference pattern mentioned in the introduction .",
    "an alternative interpretation of the same situation is that the outgoing wave has suffered the effect of many resonances that are present inside the cavity .",

    "in this contribution we reviewed a model that was originally developed in the realm of nuclear physics , and applied it to the description of statistical quantum mechanical scattering of one - particle systems inside cavities whose underlying classical dynamics is chaotic .",
    "the same model is also applicable to the study of scattering of classical waves by cavities of a similar shape .    in the scheme that we have described ,",
    "the @xmath55 matrix is idealized as a stationary random ( matrix ) function of @xmath52 , satisfying the condition of ergodicity .",
    "it is assumed that we have two distinct time scales in the problem , arising from a prompt and an equilibrated component : the former one is associated with direct processes , like short paths , and is described through the optical matrix @xmath73 .    the statistical distribution of @xmath0 is proposed as one of maximum entropy , once the reproducing property described in the text is fulfilled and the system - dependent optical @xmath73 is specified . in other words , system - specific details other than the optical matrix @xmath73",
    "are assumed to be irrelevant .",
    "the predictions of the model for the conductance distribution in the presence of direct processes should be experimentally observable in microstructures where phase breaking is small enough , the sampling being performed by varying the energy or shape of the structure with an external gate voltage . they have also been observed in microwave scattering experiments .",
    "comparison of the theoretical predictions with computer simulations indicate that the present formulation has a remarkable predictive power : indeed , it describes statistical properties of the quantum conductance of cavities , like its average , its fluctuations , and its full distribution in a variety of cases , both in the absence and in the presence of a prompt response . here",
    "we have concentrated on the conductance distribution , mainly in the presence of prompt processes .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we found that , with a few exceptions , it was possible to find energy intervals @xmath81 containing many fine - structure resonances in which approximate stationarity could be defined ; the agreement was generally found to be good . in contrast , in ref .",
    "@xcite we encountered cases in which this was not possible and we undertook a closer analysis of the problem . we found that reducing @xmath81 , even at the expense of decreasing the number of fine - structure resonances inside it , improved the agreement considerably . in a number of cases ,",
    "@xmath81 was reduced literally to a point and the data were collected over an ensemble constructed by changing the position of an obstacle inside the cavity : in other words , poisson s kernel was found to give a good description of the statistics of the data taken across the ensemble for a fixed energy . as a result , poisson s kernel seems to be valid beyond the situation where it was originally derived , where the properties of stationarity and ergodicity played an important role .",
    "it is as though the reproducing property of eq .",
    "( [ repr_property ] ) , which is a property of the ensemble defined for a fixed energy , were valid even in the absence of stationarity and ergodicity , which were originally used to derive it . at the present moment we are unable to give an explanation of this fact .",
