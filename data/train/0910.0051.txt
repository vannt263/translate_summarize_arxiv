    "the past decade has seen a fruitful interplay between problems in condensed matter physics and concepts from quantum information theory .",
    "entanglement entropy , as reviewed below , has been studied for a wide variety of quantum many - particle systems and has given some considerable insight into both quantum criticality and quantum topological phases .",
    "more recently it has become clear that for some purposes the entanglement entropy is an insufficient characterization of the quantum information in a quantum state . both for topological phases and for quantum critical systems ,",
    "several recent studies have shown that more information about entanglement , the full `` entanglement spectrum '' , is required to describe important physical properties .",
    "the purpose of this article is to examine entanglement spectra at and near several quantum critical points in one dimension , chiefly by numerical methods .",
    "this serves as a test of existing theoretical predictions .",
    "the main subject of this paper is a set of numerical tests of the validity of the approximate distribution of eigenvalues in the entanglement spectra derived by calabrese and lefevre  @xcite .",
    "the entanglement entropy of a pure state @xmath0 of a bipartite system @xmath1 is defined as the von neumann entropy of reduced density matrix @xmath2 , obtained by tracing out subsystem @xmath3 .",
    "the result is symmetric with respect to @xmath4 and @xmath3 : s_a = - tr  _ a _",
    "a = - tr  _ b _ b = s_b .",
    "this symmetry follows from the schmidt decomposition , which is convenient for our later discussion .",
    "the schmidt decomposition @xcite for a bipartite system expresses the original wavefunction as a sum of product states of wavefunctions for the two parts of the system , with the bases chosen for those two parts so that the terms in the sum involve orthogonal wavefunctions : @xmath5 the @xmath6 and @xmath7 form orthonormal bases for the hilbert spaces of the subsystems @xmath4 and @xmath3 , and the @xmath8 are positive .",
    "the schmidt decomposition contains more than one term for entangled states , and the entanglement entropy is s=-_n _ n _",
    "n. [ eq : defs2 ] note that the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix are the squares of the coefficients appearing in the schmidt decomposition and @xmath9 .",
    "clearly the entanglement entropy is a particular combination of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix .",
    "the `` entanglement spectrum '' , i.e. , the full set of eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix , clearly contains additional information in principle . for topological phases arising in the quantum hall effect",
    ", the entanglement spectrum has been argued to contain information about topological order  @xcite beyond that of the entropy , which contains information about the `` quantum dimensions '' of the topological phase  @xcite .",
    "the entropy has been a powerful tool in numerical studies to identify topological phases  @xcite .",
    "the value of entanglement spectrum for critical points , as studied in this paper , is slightly different from its use in measuring topological order .",
    "it has been argued by calabrese and lefevre  @xcite that quantum critical points have an entanglement spectrum with a universal one - parameter dependence ; since this one parameter can be taken to be the entanglement entropy , one might think that for quantum critical points , the entanglement spectrum contains no more useful information than the entanglement entropy .",
    "however , the detailed form of the entanglement spectrum is important ; as an example , the calabrese - lefevre approximate form of the entanglement spectrum was used recently as the basis of a theory for `` finite - entanglement scaling '' , i.e. , how the finite entanglement available in a matrix product state representation affects the observed behavior at quantum critical points . for this application ,",
    "understanding not just the entanglement entropy but the full spectrum is essential , and the nature of this spectrum near a one - dimensional quantum critical point is the subject of this paper .",
    "the focus on one - dimensional quantum critical points results from two technical considerations , one numerical and one analytical .",
    "numerically , the matrix - product - state class of numerical methods ( dmrg and its descendants ) , reviewed in the following section , are especially powerful in one dimension and capable of giving essentially exact ground - state properties for many systems away from criticality .",
    "analytically , conformal invariance of the @xmath10-dimensional path integral applies at most interesting critical points in any spatial dimension @xmath11 , but only for @xmath12 is the ( local ) conformal algebra infinite - dimensional .",
    "this infinite - dimensional algebra closely constrains the behavior of one - dimensional systems close to critical points and has led to numerous predictions about entanglement entropy at such critical points , many of which have been confirmed numerically .    in the following section , we review the relevant analytical results on entanglement entropy and entanglement spectrum at one - dimensional critical points .",
    "section iii briefly reviews matrix product states and the infinite time - evolved block decimation  @xcite ( itebd ) and presents our numerical results on several quantum critical points , including some integrable cases as a check and also some non - integrable cases .",
    "an important early example of overlap between condensed matter physics and quantum information was the realization that `` most '' quantum critical points in one dimension ( those with conformal invariance ) have universal entanglement entropy determined by the central charge of the conformal field theory ( cft ) .",
    "since central charge was already known to determine properties of the critical point related to entropy , such as the free energy at small nonzero temperature , it is intuitively plausible that the entanglement entropy is also related to this quantity . for a partition of an infinite one - dimensional chain into a contiguous region of @xmath13 sites and the infinite remainder , the entanglement entropy scales for large @xmath13 as  @xcite s_n ~c 3 n. when the system is away from criticality , this logarithmic divergence is cut off by the correlation length @xmath14 , measured in units of the lattice spacing @xmath15 : s_n ( / a ) .",
    "these entanglement entropies are universal since they depend only on central charge ; different critical points in the same universality class have the same entanglement entropy .",
    "an elegant derivation of these results  @xcite is via a replica trick that obtains the entanglement entropy using the theory defined on a particular riemann surface ; the central charge then appears via the mapping of an ordinary plane to this riemann surface .",
    "it is believed that the full entanglement spectrum that leads to this entropy is not universal but nearly so  @xcite , as now explained .",
    "since the entanglement spectrum is not universal , it should not follow from the conformal mapping method that makes clear the universality of the entropy .",
    "there are only a few results on the behavior of entanglement entropy at translation - invariant critical points above one spatial dimension   @xcite and in general the entanglement spectrum has not been considered .",
    "hence we focus on the entanglement spectrum at or near a one - dimensional quantum critical point with conformal invariance .",
    "the entanglement spectrum can be obtained from traces of all powers of the reduced density matrix : r _ _ a^. in order to make the entanglement spectrum well - defined , we have to introduce a length scale @xmath16 coming from either a block size or a correlation length , just as for the entanglement entropy .",
    "when this length scale is much larger than any microscopic scale , a scaling analysis  @xcite predicts r_= c_l_eff^-c ( - 1/)/6 , where @xmath17 are nonuniversal constants .",
    "following ref .",
    ", we introduce the parameter @xmath18 and rewrite this as r_= c_e^-b ( - 1/),b = c 6 l_eff and can obtain the form of the entanglement spectrum immediately _ under the assumption _ that the @xmath17 are constant .",
    "this assumption of constant @xmath17 was shown to be a good approximation for the @xmath19 model and even on the whole @xmath20 line ( more details are given later ) . however , it seems valuable to evaluate the validity of this assumption more generally , including for models that are not integrable . note that the parameter @xmath18 is simply related to the entanglement entropy @xmath21 obtained for this distribution : @xmath22 . for",
    "conformally invariant models , @xmath18 is related to the largest eigenvalue of the density matrix @xmath23 .",
    "this is the so called single - copy entanglement @xcite .",
    "we found numerically , that this relation holds in good approximation if we slightly detune the system from criticality .    under the assumption of constant @xmath17 ,",
    "a laplace transform leads to a universal one - parameter distribution of density matrix eigenvalues near the critical point  @xcite .",
    "the parameter appearing in the distribution , which we take to be @xmath18 , combines both an `` intrinsic '' property of the critical point ( the central charge ) and an `` extrinsic '' one ( either the correlation length or the block size , whichever is smaller ) .",
    "an intuitive way to express this distribution is via the mean number of eigenvalues larger than a given value @xmath24 , n ( ) = _ ^_maxdp ( ) = i_0(2 ) [ eq : lev_for ] . here",
    "the largest eigenvalue @xmath25 is determined by the one parameter @xmath18 : @xmath26 .",
    "as @xmath18 increases , the tail of the distribution becomes longer .",
    "examples of this distribution are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : isi_lev][fig : spin1_lev ] below .",
    "the entanglement spectrum of 1d systems away from criticality has also been discussed in the context of majorization theory in ref .  .",
    "our main results are obtained using the infinite time - evolving block decimation ( itebd ) algorithm @xcite to study several one - dimensional hamiltonians with translationally invariant ground states .",
    "this algorithm can be viewed as a descendant of the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "both dmrg and itebd construct trial wavefunctions that are `` matrix product states '' ( mps ) @xcite .",
    "we review the basics of such states in order to understand their connection to the entanglement spectrum .",
    "we consider a system with @xmath13 sites and periodic boundary conditions , where each site has @xmath11 orthogonal states .",
    "any pure state of the system is a superposition of the product basis states @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",

    "wavefunction for a chain of particles / spins is obtained by multiplying together scalar amplitudes for the particle / spin state at each site .",
    "the mps generates entanglement by using matrices for each site and can store an increasing amount of information as the matrix dimension @xmath33 increases . for fixed @xmath33 ,",
    "there are at most @xmath33 nonzero eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix , and hence the maximum possible entanglement is @xmath34 .",
    "the advantage of requiring translational invariance is that there are only finitely many different matrices @xmath35 .",
    "the itebd algorithm finds an approximation of the ground state by performing an imaginary time evolution of a randomly chosen initial mps @xmath36 with fixed dimension @xmath33 .",
    "it is therefore required that @xmath36 has a non - zero overlap with the ground state .",
    "because this method always constructs wavefunctions for the infinite system , its errors result from finite entanglement rather than finite size , and one application of the entanglement spectrum was to develop a theory  @xcite for the `` finite - entanglement scaling '' of resulting errors  @xcite : the effective correlation length induced by finite entanglement for a critical hamiltonian scales as @xmath37 , where the exponent @xmath38 is determined by the central charge at the critical point . for the itebd simulations presented in this paper , we used a second order trotter decomposition for the imaginary time evolution with decreasing time steps @xmath39 .",
    "we perform the evolution until the energy is converged up to 12 digits and the entanglement entropy up to 6 digits .",
    "the run times of the algorithm depends very strongly on the model and the parameters used @xcite .",
    "we will limit ourselves in this paper to cases in which the itebd algorithm converges effectively to the matrices of a given dimension that are the best approximation of the ground state . in a gapped phase ,",
    "the entanglement entropy of the exact wavefunction is finite , and the approximation by mps s converges rapidly  @xcite .",
    "the itebd result should therefore converge to the physically correct distribution if the correlation length @xmath14 ( i.e. , the correlation length in the physical system , not the finite - entanglement approximation ) satisfies a , where @xmath15 is the correlation length and @xmath33 is the matrix size . when these conditions are satisfied , the itebd result is not evolving rapidly with @xmath33 , and",
    "the numerical spectrum should be that of the physical system .",
    "the approach of the numerical spectrum to the physical one is somewhat subtle , because the physical spectrum even at finite correlation length has an infinite number of nonzero eigenvalues , while the numerical spectrum has at most @xmath33 .",
    "however , the fraction of total probability in the tail of small eigenvalues becomes very small with increasing @xmath33 away from criticality , unlike at the critical point .",
    "note that this limit is different from the finite - entanglement scaling limit @xmath40 , where the physical correlation length is effectively infinite but there is an apparent correlation length in numerics .",
    "hence a different type of result is expected when the correlation length satisfies @xmath41 .",
    "it was observed previously  @xcite that the calabrese - lefevre distribution approximately describes the spectra obtained in this limit , where the correlation length is generated by finite @xmath33 . in the following section ,",
