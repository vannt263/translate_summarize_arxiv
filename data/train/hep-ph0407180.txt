    "supersymmetry ( susy ) provides an elegant solution to the gauge hierarchy problem , and grand unified theories ( guts ) give us a simple understanding of the quantum numbers of the standard model ( sm ) fermions .",
    "in addition , the success of gauge coupling unification in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) strongly supports the possibility of the susy gut .",
    "other appealing features include that the electroweak symmetry breaking is induced by radiative corrections due to the large top quark yukawa coupling , and that tiny neutrino masses can be naturally explained by the see - saw mechanism",
    ". therefore , susy gut is one of the most promising candidates that describe the known fundamental interactions in nature except gravity .",
    "however , there are problems in the 4-dimensional susy gut : the doublet - triplet splitting problem , the proton decay problem , the fermion mass problem , and the gut gauge symmetry breaking mechanism .    during the last few years",
    ", orbifold guts have been studied extensively  @xcite .",
    "the main point is that the supersymmetric gut models exist in 5 or 6 dimensional space - time , and they are broken down to 4-dimensional @xmath0 supersymmetric sm like models for the zero modes through compactification on various orbifolds .",
    "this is because the orbifold parity projects out the zero modes of some components in vector multiplet and hypermultiplets .",
    "the gut gauge symmetry breaking problem , the doublet - triplet splitting problem and the fermion mass problem have been solved elegantly by orbifold projections .",
    "the proton decay problem can be solved because we can define a continuous @xmath9 symmetry .",
    "other interesting phenomenology , like flavour symmetry from the @xmath10 symmetry , gauge - fermion unification , gauge - higgs unification , and gauge - yukawa unification , have also been studied  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , deconstruction was proposed about three year ago to latticize the gauge theories in higher dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the idea of deconstruction is interesting because it gives a uv completion to the higher dimensional theories .",
    "applying this idea to orbifold susy guts , we are able to construct interesting 4-dimensional susy guts where the problems in the usual 4-dimensional models can be solved , in other words , the merits of orbifold guts can be preserved  @xcite .",
    "in addition , inspired by deconstruction of orbifold susy guts , we can construct new models which can not be obtained from orbifold guts while still retain the nice properties in orbifold models .",
    "deconstruction of the orbifold @xmath11 models were discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in these models",
    "the doublet - triplet splitting problem and the proton decay problem can be solved .",
    "deconstruction may also provide insight into fermion masses and mixings  @xcite .",
    "since the number of fields in these models is finite , the corrections to gauge couplings can be reliably calculated , and there exist threshold corrections to the differential runnings of the gauge couplings  @xcite .",
    "elements of deconstruction can be found in earlier papers  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we construct 4-dimensional @xmath0 supersymmetric @xmath1 models inspired by deconstruction of the 5-dimensional @xmath0 supersymmetric orbifold @xmath1 models and high dimensional non - supersymmetric @xmath1 models with wilson line gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "we study @xmath2 models with bi - fundamental link fields where the gauge symmetry can be broken down to the pati - salam ( ps ) , @xmath3 , flipped @xmath4 or the sm like gauge symmetry .",
    "however , we need to fine - tune the superpotential in the models , in order to have the doublet - triplet splitting . in addition , we propose an @xmath12 model where the gauge symmetry can be broken down to ps gauge symmetry , and an @xmath6 model with bi - spinor link fields ( @xmath13 ) and ( @xmath14 ) , in which the gauge symmetry is broken down to the flipped @xmath15 gauge symmetry . in these models",
    ", the gauge symmetry can be further broken down to the sm gauge symmetry , and the doublet - triplet splitting is naturally realized through the missing partner mechanism .",
    "the proton decay due to dimension-5 operators is thus negligible and the proton lifetime due to dimension-6 operators is well above the current experimental bound because the gut scale is at least a few times @xmath16 gev .",
    "therefore , there is no proton decay problem .",
    "we also discuss the gauge coupling unification in these two models .",
    "furthermore , we briefly comment on the interesting variation models with gauge groups @xmath7 and @xmath17 where the proton decay problem can be solved , and the @xmath6 model with bi - spinor link fields in which the gauge symmetry is broken down to the @xmath3 gauge symmetry .",
    "we first give a brief review of the orbifold susy guts and the non - susy guts with wilson line gauge symmetry breaking , and deconstruction of both types of models in section  [ sec : review ] .",
    "we then discuss the models where the gauge symmetry can be broken down to the diagonal ps gauge symmetry in section  [ sec : patsal ] .",
