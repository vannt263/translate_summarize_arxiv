    "disk - planet interaction and type i planetary migration is one of the main issues in the theory of planet formation . a low mass planet or the core of the gas giant planet embedded in the protoplanetary disk excites spiral density wave in the disk , which carries angular momentum flux away from the planet .",
    "the linear calculation of the spiral density wave is first carried out by goldreich and tremaine ( 1979 ) , and there has been a number of extensive work assuming inviscid , isothermal disk such as ward ( 1986 , 1989 ) , artymowicz ( 1993 ) , and tanaka et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . in the case of an inviscid , isothermal disk ,",
    "protoplanets migrate towards the central star as a result of disk - planet interaction very rapidly , thereby imposing a serious problem on the theory of planet formation .",
    "the decay of the orbital semi - major axis of the protoplanet is a result of the subtle difference between the inner disk ( the part of the disk inside the orbit of the protoplanet ) and the outer disk ( the part of the disk outside the orbit of the protoplanet ) .",
    "the outer disk exerts torque on the protoplanet in such a way that the semi - major axis decreases , and the inner disk exerts opposite torque . in the lowest order of the local approximation , or shearing - sheet approximation",
    ", these two effects cancel each other , and the difference appears at higher order .",
    "therefore , type i migration can be very sensitive to the physical state of the disk .",
    "indeed , when non - isothermal effect is taken into account , the direction of migration can be reversed ( paardekooper and mellema 2006 , baruteau and masset 2008 , paardekooper and papaloizou 2008 ) .",
    "it is also discussed that the global magnetic field can slow down the rate of type i migration or even reverse the direction ( terquem 2003 , fromang et al .",
    "2005 , muto et al .",
    "2008 ) .    in order to construct a predictable , self - consistent model for planet formation , it is important to make clear how different physical processes of the disk affect disk - planet interaction and type i migration . in this paper , we revisit the effects of viscosity on disk - planet interaction .",
    "there has been a number of work on this topic .",
    "meyer - vernet and sicardy ( 1987 ) discussed that the viscosity does not affect the torque exerted on the planet as long as its value is small , although the shape of the wake may be modified .",
    "papaloizou and lin ( 1984 , and a series of their paper ) and takeuchi et al . (",
    "1996 ) calculated that the damping of the density wave and the transfer of the angular momentum from the density wave to the background disk , resulting in the gap formation around a massive planet .",
    "masset ( 2001 ) investigated the effects of viscosity on the horseshoe regions and discussed how the corotation torque may be altered by the effect of viscosity .",
    "more recently , paardekooper and papaloizou ( 2009b ) investigated the dynamics of corotation region using both linear and non - linear calculations .    although there has been a number of investigations on the disk - planet interaction in a viscous disk ( for example , masset 2001 , 2002 or paardekooper and papaloizou 2009a for corotation torque , dangelo et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 for high resolution numerical study ) , there has not yet been a study of wide range in the viscous coefficient that requires an analysis on the detailed density structure in the vicinity of the planet . in this paper , as a first step for the complete investigation , we show results of linear calculation in a local , shearing - sheet analysis .",
    "we use time - dependent methods to calculate the disk response against the planet potential .",
    "although this method has not been widely used so far , this is useful in investigating the effects of various physical processes on disk - planet interaction .",
    "we calculate the non - axisymmetric density structure around the planet and investigate how the resulting torque is altered by the effect of shear viscosity .",
    "we have studied wide range of the parameters of viscous coefficient and calculate the density structure with high resolution .",
    "we find that the density structure in the vicinity of the planet is altered in a viscous disk , with viscous coefficient of @xmath0 in terms of @xmath1 ( standard @xmath1 parameter , see equation ( [ alpha_def ] ) for definition ) , which may be realized as a result of the turbulence induced by magneto - rotational instability ( mri , balbus and hawley 1991 , sano et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "since it is not possible to calculate the total torque ( differential torque between the disk inside the orbit of the planet and outside ) in shearing - sheet approximation , we look at one - sided torque to investigate how type i migration rate can be affected qualitatively by viscosity .",
    "one - sided torque is the torque exerted by one side of the disk with respect to the planet s orbital radius .",
    "we also note that shearing - sheet calculation is a useful first step before differential torque is calculated ( tanaka et al .",
    "we find that as we increase the values of viscous coefficient @xmath1 , one - sided torque stays unchanged until @xmath2 , then increases until @xmath3 , and finally decreases .",
    "the torque can be factor of two larger than inviscid case when @xmath4 , and more importantly , the enhancement of the torque is a result of the modified density structure in the vicinity of the planet , which has not yet been investigated in detail .",
    "our results indicate that the physical mechanisms of the disk - planet interaction in a viscous disk may depend on the detailed density structure around the planet .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section [ basiceqn ]",
    "we show the basic equations and describe the time - dependent methods to obtain a stationary , non - axisymmetric pattern of linear perturbation .",
    "we also discuss how two - dimensional ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) analyses are related in this section . in section",
    "[ results ] , we show the results of 2d and 3d calculations and show how the torque behaves as we vary the amount of viscosity . in section [ analyticdiscussion ] , we explain the qualitative behavior of the torque using a simple analytic model . section [ discussionsummary ] is for discussion and summary .",
    "we consider isothermal navier - stokes equations with one planet using shearing - sheet approximation .",
    "@xmath5 where @xmath6 is density , @xmath7 is velocity , @xmath8 is the kepler angular velocity of the planet , @xmath9 is the gravitational potential of the planet , @xmath10 is shear viscosity .",
    "the third term of left hand side of equation ( [ eom_full ] ) is coriolis force and the second term of right hand side of equation ( [ eom_full ] ) is tidal force .",
    "we assume the planet is located at the origin and stationary with respect to this coordinate system , i.e. , @xmath11 where @xmath9 does not depend on time . in this paper",
    ", we neglect bulk viscosity for simplicity .",
    "we also neglect vertical stratification and assume that the background density without a planet is homogeneous .",
    "this gives an uncertainty in the box size in the @xmath12-direction , which will be discussed in section [ lzsize ] .",
    "we also neglect the effect of global gas pressure gradient exerted on the background disk and assume that the background gas is rotating at kepler velocity .",
    "the unperturbed state without a planet is given by @xmath13 in the presence of viscosity , if we perform a global analysis , there is a mass accretion onto the central star in general .",
    "however , in the shearing - sheet approximation , where linear background shear is assumed , this effect is not taken into account .",
    "we expect that the density structure only in the vicinity of the planet can be well approximated even if we neglect the global mass accretion .",
    "we consider linear perturbation .",
    "all the perturbation quantities are denoted with @xmath14 , e.g. , @xmath15 for density perturbation .",
    "perturbation equations are given by @xmath16 @xmath17 we solve equations ( [ eoc_pert ] ) and ( [ eom_pert ] ) to obtain a steady state solution and calculate torque exerted on one side ( either @xmath18 or @xmath19 ) of the disk by the planet .",
    "the torque exerted on the planet is obtained as a backreaction of this torque .",
    "since we use shearing - sheet approximation , torque exerted from each side of the planet is the same in magnitude and opposite in sign .",
    "although we do not obtain a net torque , it is still possible to investigate how the disk structure is affected by the viscosity and qualitatively predict how the disk and planet interact .    in order to obtain a steady state solution",
    ", we solve linear perturbation equations ( [ eoc_pert ] ) and ( [ eom_pert ] ) using fourier transform methods given by goodman and rafikov ( 2001 ) .",
    "we transform the equations into the shearing coordinate @xmath20 defined by @xmath21 in this coordinate system , temporal and spatial derivatives are given by @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 then , perturbation equations become @xmath25 @xmath26 where the spatial derivatives in @xmath27 are given by equations ( [ dx_shear ] ) and ( [ dydz_shear ] ) .",
    "the coefficients of equation ( [ eoc_pert_shear ] ) and ( [ eom_pert_shear ] ) are now independent of @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , if we fourier transform in spatial directions , we obtain a set of ordinary differential equations decoupled for each @xmath29 mode ( goldreich and lynden - bell 1965 ) , @xmath30 .",
    "\\label{decomposition_ft}\\ ] ] the relationship of wavenumber in @xmath31-coordinate and @xmath28-coordinate is given by @xmath32 @xmath33 equation ( [ kx_evol ] ) indicates that the value of radial wavenumber in @xmath31-coordinate evolves with time owing to the background shear .",
    "the value of radial wavenumber in shearing coordinate @xmath34 gives the initial value of radial wavenumber in @xmath31-plane .",
    "equations of continuity ( [ eoc_pert ] ) and motion ( [ eom_pert ] ) are now @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 and @xmath38 in equations ( [ eoc_pert_four])-([eomz_pert_four ] ) , we write all the terms in @xmath39-coordinate .",
    "these equations describe the excitation and evolution of density wave by the source @xmath9 .",
    "the source of the density wave becomes zero when wavenumber @xmath29 is large .    as an initial condition ,",
    "we assume that there is no perturbation : @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is taken to be sufficiently large in absolute magnitude and negative ( positive ) in sign for positive ( negative ) @xmath42 .",
    "if we use spatial resolution of @xmath43-direction @xmath44 , we should take @xmath45 , where upper ( lower ) sign is used for positive ( negative ) @xmath42 . as a result of time evolution , @xmath46 increases ( decreases ) for each positive ( negative ) @xmath42 mode .",
    "when @xmath46 reaches @xmath47 , where upper ( lower ) sign is for positive ( negative ) @xmath42 modes , we obtain a steady state profile of perturbation quantities in fourier space for non - axisymmetric ( @xmath48 ) modes . , the source @xmath9 is so small that we can approximate it to be zero .",
    "the fourier amplitude of the specific @xmath49 mode in @xmath39-coordinate at time @xmath50 is given by the solution at @xmath50 with @xmath51 mode .",
    "therefore , the absolute magnitude of @xmath34 that contributes to the fourier amplitude of fixed @xmath49 becomes large as time @xmath52 increases .",
    "if the absolute magnitude of @xmath34 is larger than @xmath53 , there is no wave excitation for this mode until @xmath54 becomes smaller than @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath55 , the contribution to the @xmath49 mode is always the same regardless of @xmath52 . ]",
    "the fourier amplitude of each @xmath56 mode in steady state is given by the time evolution data through equation ( [ kx_evol ] ) .",
    "the profile of physical quantities in fourier space is then inverse fourier transformed to obtain values in real space .",
    "since we are interested in torque , we do not calculate axisymmetric modes ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the standard procedure to obtain steady state solution is as follows .",
    "firstly , stationary solution in the frame corotating with the planet is assumed : @xmath58 .",
    "then , fourier transformation in the @xmath59- and @xmath12-directions is performed to obtain the ordinary differential equations in the @xmath43-direction .",
    "finally , these ordinary differential equations are solved by imposing outgoing boundary condition , or equivalently the boundary condition that admits only trailing wave , see e.g. , goldreich and tremaine ( 1979 ) , korycansky and pollack ( 1993 ) , or tanaka et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .    in the presence of viscosity ,",
    "this method introduces higher order derivative with respect to @xmath43 , since viscous terms include the second order derivative in the radial direction .",
    "the resulting ordinary differential equations are higher order in the @xmath43-derivative than in inviscid cases .",
    "the terms with the highest order derivative comes from viscous terms and their coefficients are viscous coefficient @xmath10 . in this case , it is difficult to take natural @xmath60 limit , since equations become singular in this limit .",
    "time - dependent approach overcomes this difficulty since the order of time derivative is not affected by viscous terms since they do not include any time derivative .",
    "it is also easy to take @xmath60 limit since viscous terms simply drop from equations ( [ eomx_pert_four])-([eomz_pert_four ] ) in this limit and they do not introduce any singularity .    in our formulation using the fourier transform in sheared coordinate , the outgoing boundary condition in the radial direction that is assumed in the standard stationary formulation is not exactly satisfied , since fourier transform introduces the periodic boundary condition in the sheared coordinate .",
    "however , we find that outgoing boundary condition is effectively satisfied if we vary the box size in the @xmath43-direction depending on the modes specified by @xmath42 and @xmath61 .",
    "details of our methods are given below .",
    "we also note that if we assume an initial condition with non - zero perturbation , additional homogeneous wave is introduced .",
    "this wave has both leading ( @xmath62 ) and trailing ( @xmath63 ) components and the resulting solution is simply the superposition of the specific solution of equations ( [ eoc_pert_four])-([eomz_pert_four ] ) assuming zero initial condition and homogeneous ( @xmath64 ) solution assuming the specified initial condition .",
    "the solution with non - zero initial condition is irrelevant in the present problem because we consider the perturbation that is induced by the gravitational perturbation by the planet .",
    "we write the box size in @xmath31-directions by @xmath65 and the coordinate system extends @xmath66 and so forth for other directions .",
    "practically , our procedure to obtain the stationary , non - axisymmetric structure of the disk is summarized as follows .    1",
    ".   we take @xmath67 for positive ( negative ) @xmath42 modes .",
    "equations ( [ eoc_pert_four])-([eomz_pert_four ] ) are solved with initial condition @xmath68 .",
    "3 .   resulting solutions in @xmath69 space are inverse fourier transformed to real space .    in steps 2 and 3 , there are some points we need to take care . in calculating the fourier modes ,",
    "we have varied the mesh number in @xmath56 directions , which corresponds to the step size of time , in such a way that all the oscillations are well resolved for each @xmath70 mode .",
    "the mesh number in @xmath56 direction becomes as much as @xmath71 for small @xmath42 .",
    "we perform inverse fourier transform in @xmath56 direction using the increased number of mesh in @xmath56 direction .",
    "this procedure effectively makes the box size of @xmath43-direction longer for a specific @xmath42 mode , and the data corresponding to necessary @xmath43 , which is @xmath66 , is then interpolated from the resulting profile in @xmath72 space .",
    "this data is then used to perform inverse fourier transform in @xmath70 directions . in this way , it is possible to avoid aliasing effect in @xmath43-direction and outgoing boundary condition in the steady state solution is effectively satisfied .",
    "we do not use any window function , which has been incorporated by goodman and rafikov ( 2001 ) , in fourier transform .",
    "we have checked that the resulting torque is not affected by the window function in the absence of viscosity .",
    "also , since window function introduces additional artificial dissipation , this affects our results with viscosity .",
    "once we have obtained the profiles of perturbation quantities in real space , we can calculate the one - sided torque exerted on @xmath18 part of the disk by the planet by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the semi - major axis of the planet , and the torque exerted on the planet is obtained as backreaction . for later convenience , we define `` torque distribution '' @xmath75 that is simply the torque exerted on the fluid element located at @xmath31 , @xmath76 and `` torque density '' that is the torque exerted on an annulus of the disk at @xmath43 , @xmath77    we normalize equations using @xmath78 , @xmath8 , and @xmath79 so that the homogeneous equations ( @xmath9=0 ) contain only one dimensionless variable @xmath1 that is defined by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the scale height of the disk . since we consider the linear perturbation analysis , the amplitude of the perturbation is proportional to the normalized planet mass : @xmath82 we show the results with @xmath83 in subsequent sections .",
    "we use the fifth order runge - kutta method to solve time evolution and fft routine given by press et al .",
    "( 1992 ) to perform fourier transform .",
    "we use box size of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , and the grid number in @xmath43- and @xmath59-directions @xmath86 .",
    "the three - dimensional results depend on the box size in @xmath12-direction , @xmath87 , which is discussed in the next subsection .      in this subsection , we discuss how 2d and 3d calculations differ from each other and determine the relevant box size in the @xmath12-direction with which the effect of vertical stratification is effectively taken into account .",
    "we compare 2d calculation and 2d mode of 3d calculation . by `` 2d calculation '' , we mean the gravitational potential of the planet is given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 denotes the softening length of 2d calculation , which is usually incorporated in most of 2d work . by `` 2d mode of 3d calculation '' , we mean that the analysis is restricted to @xmath90 mode of 3d calculation .",
    "three - dimensional potential is given by @xmath91 therefore , gravitational potential for `` 2d mode of 3d calculation '' is given by @xmath92 where we denote softening length in 3d calculation by @xmath93 .",
    "we note that @xmath94 and @xmath95 coincides if @xmath96 , but they differ if @xmath97 , since in this case , 3d potential behaves as @xmath98 while 2d potential behaves as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 .",
    "vertical averaging makes the potential weaker in the vicinity of the planet , thereby producing small perturbation in 2d mode of 3d calculation .",
    "figure [ fig : varheight ] shows the torque obtained by 2d inviscid ( @xmath101 ) calculation using @xmath94 and @xmath95 with various @xmath87 .",
    "we note that in producing figure [ fig : varheight ] , one - sided torque is calculated according to equation ( [ def_totaltorque ] ) and the value is normalized by @xmath102 it is clear that 2d and 3d results coincide if @xmath87 is small , but the 3d result becomes small when @xmath87 is large .    the reasonable value of @xmath87 may be obtained by comparing the results of 2d mode of 3d calculation with calculation in which vertical stratification is taken into account .",
    "tanaka et al .",
    "( 2002 ) performed such calculations for an inviscid disk .",
    "their method is to decompose vertical modes in terms of hermite polynomials , and they have found that the vertically averaged 2d mode gives most of the contribution to the resulting torque .",
    "their 2d mode of the potential , @xmath103 , is given by @xmath104     k_0 \\left [ \\left ( x^2+y^2+\\epsilon_{\\rm 3d}^2 \\right)/4 \\right ] ,    \\label{psi_strat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 is the modified bessel function of the zeroth order .",
    "fitting equation ( [ psi_unstrat ] ) with equation ( [ psi_strat ] ) , we find @xmath106 gives a reasonable agreement , see figure [ fig : potfit ] .",
    "zeroth order of modified local approximation incorporated by tanaka et al .",
    "( 2002 ) coincides with the shearing - sheet approximation , and we have exactly the same homogeneous equations with them for 2d ( @xmath90 ) mode if we assume @xmath107 .",
    "as is clear from figure [ fig : varheight ] , 2d mode in 3d calculation gives smaller amount of torque than the calculation using 2d potential given by equation ( [ psi_pure2d ] ) .",
    "this explains why tanaka et al .",
    "( 2002 ) has obtained slightly smaller amount of torque compared to 2d results .",
    "we have also checked that setting @xmath106 , our results of one - sided torque agree with those determined by using tanaka et al .",
    "( 2002 ) methods within an error of @xmath108 . ) .",
    "correspondence between the two results is given by reading our @xmath109 to @xmath110 of tanaka et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and this is how we have obtained the agreement with their calculation . ]    we use @xmath111 and the mesh number in @xmath12-direction is taken to be @xmath112 . in total , we have performed calculation with @xmath113 with mesh number @xmath114 , and the resulting mesh size is @xmath115 . however , the radial box size is variably extended according to modes in calculation , as discussed in section [ linear_anal ] .",
    "effective box size in @xmath43-direction is as much as @xmath116 .",

    "our results vary upto @xmath118 for large values of viscosity when smoothing length is varied upto twice the grid resolution .",
    "therefore , our results give at least a qualitative view of how disk - planet interaction is altered by the effects of viscosity .",
    "the variation of one - sided torque as a function of smoothing parameter is further discussed in section [ results:3d ] .",

    "it is clear that the oval density profile in the vicinity of the planet is slightly tilted for large viscous coefficient , while the spiral density wave is damped .",

    ", we present the results of 3d calculation .",
    "figure [ fig:3d_torque ] shows the one - sided torque as a function of viscosity .",
    "the qualitative behavior of torque increasing with viscosity is unchanged , but the enhancement of torque becomes large compared to 2d calculation .",
    "we fit the data and obtain the following empirical relation @xmath132 for @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "we have chosen a form of fitting function in such a way that torque converges to a non - zero value for @xmath135 , peaks at @xmath3 , and decreases to zero for @xmath136 .",
    "this fitting formula is in reasonably good agreement with our calculation in this range of viscosity coefficient .    just as in the calculations",

    "however , the gravitational potential varies only logarithmically when @xmath141 ( see equation ( [ psi_unstrat ] ) ) in calculations restricted to 2d modes .",
    "since the density fluctuation around the planet is given by @xmath142 , the deeper gravitational potential gives the higher value of the torque exerted on the planet if there is a substantial asymmetry in the density structure .",
    "calculations restricted to two - dimensional modes predict one - sided torque very well if viscosity parameter is small , since regions close to the planet ( @xmath141 ) is not very important . however , if large values of viscosity is used , it is necessary to perform full three - dimensional calculations since the density structure close to the planet is important .    at the end of section [ lzsize",

    "since contribution to one - sided torque in case of large viscosity mainly comes from the density structure close to the planet , it may depend on the grid resolution used in the calculation .",

    "we note that in case of small viscosity , we have obtained well - converged values of one - sided torque since the effective lindblad resonances , which are located at @xmath154 , are all well resolved .",
    "we note that the vertical averaging , large softening length , and coarser grid all introduce more softened potential in the vicinity of the planet and therefore one - sided torque becomes smaller in case of large viscosity .",
    "equations ( [ psi_full3d ] ) and ( [ psi_unstrat ] ) show that the vertically averaged potential diverges at the location of the planet more mildly .",
    "gravitational force becomes weaker in the vicinity of the planet if we use larger values of softening length .",
    "the larger grid scale cuts off gravitational potential at larger distance .    from the behaviors",
    "when we vary the softening parameter and the grid scale , we conclude that the values of the one - sided torque obtained in our calculation for large viscosity is the lower limit .",
    "we also argue that the numerical treatment in the vicinity of the planet may cause a quantitative difference in the one - sided torque since it may change the density structure in the vicinity of the planet . if high values of viscosity is assumed , the density structure close to the planet is important and therefore , three - dimensional calculation with high resolution and small softening parameter is essential .",
    "the resolution and the softening parameter should be determined , in principle , by considering the realistic size of the planet .",
    "we have seen that the viscosity exerted on the disk can change the density structure in the vicinity of the planet and in a viscous disk , the planet experiences one - sided torque from the gas well inside the effective lindblad resonance . in this section ,",
    "we show that a dissipative force distorts the density structure close to the planet by using a simple analytic model .",

    "physically , @xmath163 is the perturbation of vortensity , which is actually conserved in this model since we neglect terms with @xmath46 and we assume friction force is exerted only in the @xmath59-direction .",
    "therefore , @xmath163 is zero if we assume there is no vortensity perturbation initially .",
    "since we are interested in the perturbation that arises from the planet potential , we assume @xmath164 hereafter .    using equations ( [ eoc_model ] ) and ( [ eq_oneint ] ) to eliminate @xmath165 and @xmath166 from equation ( [ eomy_model ] ) , we obtain a single telegraph equation with a source terms , @xmath167 where @xmath168 the right hand side of equation ( [ telegraph ] ) is the source of perturbation that is induced by the planet s gravity .",

    "in this paper , we have performed linear analyses of density structure as a result of gravitational interaction between a planet and a viscous gas disk using shearing - sheet approximation .",
    "we have obtained the density structure in the vicinity of the planet and discussed its effect on type i migration by calculating one - sided torque .",
    "we have used time - dependent methods to obtain the density structure and a wide range of viscous parameter @xmath1 is investigated .",

    "one - sided torque converges to a well - defined value if viscosity is small , but increases as we increase the value of viscosity for @xmath215 , and then decreases as @xmath1 exceeds the order of unity .",
    "the values of one - sided torque we have obtained for large viscosity may be the lower limit of the actual value .",

    "however , we also emphasize that the results of shearing - sheet calculations are useful in calculating differential torque ( tanaka et al . 2002 ) .",
    "we have seen that the torque exerted on the planet in a viscous disk is primarily determined by the tilted spherical ( or spheroidal ) density structure in the vicinity of the planet , in contrast to the inviscid case , where main contribution of the torque comes from effective lindblad resonances and the horseshoe region . in an inviscid disk , although the value of density perturbation is large in the vicinity of the resonance , it is symmetric in @xmath59-direction and therefore , torque exerted from @xmath128 and @xmath129 cancels each other . in a viscous disk",
    ", there is an asymmetry in @xmath59-direction , resulting in increasing torque with increasing viscosity until @xmath3 . by using a simplified analytic calculations in section [ analyticdiscussion ]",
    ", we have shown that it is possible to consider these effects of viscosity as the increase of the width of lindblad resonances .",
    "when the viscous coefficient is larger than @xmath216 , however , the torque becomes small with increasing viscous coefficient since the density perturbation is damped due to large viscosity .",
    "the torque can be a factor of two larger than inviscid case .",
    "the impact of detailed structure around the planet on type i migration has not yet been fully analyzed in previous numerical simulations probably because relatively large values of viscosity ( @xmath217 ) are required to see this effect .",
    "below , we show some discussions and future prospects .        in this subsection",
    ", we discuss whether or not linear approximation well describes the real density structure around the planet . in the linear approximation",
    ", the magnitude of perturbed quantities such as @xmath218 or @xmath219 must be smaller than the order of unity . in our calculation , all the non - dimensional perturbed quantity is proportional to the value of @xmath220 , which is about @xmath221 for typical values of protoplanetary nebula .",
    "therefore , when @xmath222 becomes the order of ten in the normalized calculations given in this paper , linear approximation becomes less accurate .",
    "since the contribution of the torque in a viscous disk mainly comes from such strongly perturbed regions , it may be necessary to perform high resolution numerical calculation in order to fully obtain the structure of the density fluctuation .",
    "this is one of the future prospects of this study .",
    "however , we expect that the basic physics and the order of magnitude of one - sided torque is similar to the linear calculation .",
    "the total torque that is exerted on the planet is the differential torque , which is the difference of the torque exerted by the inner disk ( @xmath19 ) and outer disk ( @xmath18 ) . in the shearing - sheet calculations , the inner and outer disks are symmetric and",
    "therefore torque exerted on the two regions cancel each other .",
    "we have seen that the one - sided torque is mainly exerted by the tilted spheroidal density profile around the planet if strong viscosity is exerted on the disk .",
    "therefore , we expect that the asymmetry between the inner and outer disk comes from the asymmetry of the density structure around the planet , probably within , or around , the distance of the order of bondi radius , @xmath223 . assuming that the differential torque @xmath224 mainly comes from the effects of curvature",
    ", the order of the magnitude is @xmath225 where @xmath226 is one - sided torque obtained in this paper , and @xmath227 is the length scale where most contribution to the torque comes from . in the inviscid case , @xmath228 and therefore @xmath229 in the viscous case presented in this paper , @xmath227 may be as small as bondi radius @xmath230 .",
    "therefore , the lower limit of the differential torque in viscous disk may be estimated as @xmath231 and the ratio of differential torque in viscous disk and that in inviscid disk may be given by @xmath232 since @xmath233 and @xmath234 from our calculation , differential torque in a viscous disk can be much smaller than that in an inviscid disk , although one - sided torque becomes larger when the value of viscosity is @xmath3 .",
    "in order to include the effect of asymmetry , which comes from curvature effect , it is necessary to proceed to modified local approximation ( tanaka et al .",
    "2002 ) or to perform a global calculation . in order to find the precise value of the torque exerted on the disk and",
    "find how various physical processes change the nature of type i migration , the time - dependent formulation of modified local approximation is necessary .      in the shearing - sheet formalism",
    ", we can not calculate corotation torque . for two - dimensional modes ,",
    "this is because all the background quantities ( and therefore vortensity ) are assumed to be constant . for three - dimensional modes",
    ", we note that , in tanaka et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , there is a singularity at corotation modes ( see equation ( a5 ) of their paper ) .",
    "however , this singularity does not account for the torque in itself .",
    "results of shearing - sheet calculations must be combined with the higher order solutions of modified local approximation in order to find the torque exerted at corotation resonance , see equation ( 57 ) of tanaka et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "if we assume that time derivatives of equations ( [ eoc_pert ] ) and ( [ eom_pert ] ) are zero in order to obtain a stationary solution , we also find a similar singularity at @xmath235 for three - dimensional waves ( @xmath236 ) , even we have assumed the constant background density in the @xmath12-direction .",
    "however , within the shearing - sheet formalism , it does not give a torque at the corotation .",
    "also , this singularity does not seem to play a major role in our time - dependent calculations , since there is no singularity in our formulation .",
    "if we proceed to the modified local approximation , we expect that it is possible to calculate the corotation torque in the linear regime .",
    "recently , paardekooper and papaloizou ( 2009a ) has shown that large viscosity will push the corotation torque into a linear regime .",
    "therefore , not only from the point of view of differential torque but also from the view of the corotation torque , extension of our time - dependent methods to modified local approximation is an interesting future work .    in summary , in order to predict the precise value of the torque ,",
    "it is necessary to use a modified local approximation or perform global calculations , which can take into account the curvature effect .",
    "non - linear analysis may be important since the main contribution comes from the region in the vicinity of the planet where density is strongly perturbed .",
    "however , we believe that the basic physics that exerts torque onto the planet can be captured by this linear analysis and therefore , high - resolution study is necessary . in global calculations , we also note that it is also possible to investigate the effects of gas accretion onto the central star on type i migration , which is always present in a viscous disk but is not captured in our local calculations .",
    "recently , paardekooper and papaloizou ( 2009b ) has shown an interesting results regarding the flow structure close to the planet . in this section ,",
    "we observe streamline of the flow in the vicinity of the planet and compare our results with those previously studied .",
    "we note that since we have not calculated axisymmetric ( @xmath57 ) modes , the flow structure we have obtained is incomplete .",
    "however , we can still find some qualitative difference between inviscid and viscous calculations .",
    "figure [ fig : dens_stream ] shows the streamlines plotted over the density fluctuations for calculations corresponding to figure [ fig:2d_dens ] . results with @xmath126 and @xmath127 are shown .",
    "calculations are restricted to 2d modes of 3d calculation .",
    "mass ratio between the planet and the central star @xmath237 and disk aspect ratio @xmath238 are assumed in such a way that @xmath239 , just as paardekooper and papaloizou ( 2009b ) .",
    "we find that the width of horseshoe orbit is @xmath240 for @xmath126 , while the width becomes slightly narrower in calculations with @xmath127 .",
    "we have obtained about a factor of two smaller horseshoe width compared to paardekooper and papaloizou ( 2009b ) in calculations with small viscosity ( see figure 3 of their paper . )",
    "we think that this is probably because we have weaker potential in the vicinity of the planet because of the effective softening introduced by vertical averaging , see equation ( [ psi_unstrat ] ) . in paardekooper and papaloizou ( 2009b )",
    ", they also obtained narrower horseshoe width in calculations with larger softening parameters .",
    "however , since we have neglected axisymmetric modes and non - linear effects , which may be potentially important in determining the streamline , this issue needs further investigation .",
    "although we have neglected the axisymmetric modes in our calculations , a viscous overstability in axisymmetric modes has been discussed , especially in the context of saturn s rings . in this subsection",
    ", we discuss whether this overstability affects our results .    local linear analysis of viscous overstability using a simple hydrodynamic model is performed by schmidt et al .",
    "stability criterion for isothermal case depends on the derivative of viscous coefficient @xmath10 with respect to surface density perturbation .",
    "we note that the system of equations we have solved , equations ( [ eoc_pert_four])-([eomz_pert_four ] ) , are actually stable against viscous overstability , since our assumption of viscosity corresponds to @xmath241 of schmidt et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . ) and ( [ eom_pert ] ) and their equation ( 8) .",
    "note there is no self - gravity and bulk viscosity in our calculations and we assumed isothermal equation of state . ] in this case , we do not expect viscous overstability to occur and therefore , we can safely neglect the axisymmetric modes .    however , disk may be prone to viscous overstability if different prescription of viscosity is taken into account .",
    "if the non - linear consequence of viscous overstability produces non - axisymmetric structure in the vicinity of the planet , this may exert additional torque onto the planet .",
    "however , observation of the particle simulation performed by schmidt et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ( their figure 1 for example ) indicates that non - axisymmetric modes are not strongly driven by the viscous overstability and therefore this may not play an important role in planetary migration .",
    "nonetheless , the effects of viscous overstability seems to be an interesting extension of the analysis presented here .      in this subsection",
    ", we briefly discuss that our analysis may indicate that the stochastic torque is important in a turbulent disk dominated by magneto - rotational instability ( see e.g. , nelson and papaloizou 2004 ) .",
    "the effective turbulent viscosity originated in mri may become as much as @xmath242 ( e.g. , sano et al .",
    "therefore , our calculation indicates that the density structure around the planet is more important than the tidal wave launched at the effective lindblad resonances .",
    "since the density structure around the planet is turbulent in the vicinity of the planet , stochastic force may be exerted on the planet embedded in such a turbulent disk .    in order for",
    "the @xmath1-viscosity prescription [ see equation ( [ alpha_def ] ) ] to be a good approximation of the turbulent flow , the length scale in consideration must be larger than the eddy size . in the present problem ,",
    "the scale in consideration is smaller than disk thickness . in a turbulent flow driven by mri , eddies of sizes on the order of several tenths of",
    "the disk scale lengths exist .",
    "this can be understood if we notice that the wavelength of the most unstable mode is much smaller than the scale height of the disk with weak magnetic field .",
    "if weak poloidal magnetic field , @xmath243 , is exerted on the unperturbed disk , there always exists a net magnetic flux , @xmath244 where @xmath245 is the horizontally averaged @xmath12-component of magnetic field .",
    "therefore , there always exists eddies with scales of the order of the most unstable mode of magneto - rotational instability with net flux @xmath243 , @xmath246 where @xmath247 is the eddy scale , @xmath248 is alfvn   velocity constructed from the average poloidal field , and @xmath249 is keplerian angular frequency . in most cases , alfvn velocity is smaller than sound speed by more than an order of a magnitude , @xmath250 this indicates @xmath251 thus , we can possibly use the effective turbulent viscosity in order to study the qualitative effects of the interaction between a turbulent disk and a planet .",
    "however , the effective values of @xmath1 may be obtained by averaging turbulent stress over several scale heights , since it includes all sizes of eddy that is important in turbulent flow driven by mri .",
    "thus , the use of @xmath1 prescription may not be valid in discussing very small scale structure , and full mhd calculation is necessary .",
    "more detailed , quantitative analyses require high - resolution numerical study of the magnetized turbulent disk .",
    "we have found that the effects of viscosity becomes apparent if @xmath1 exceeds the value of @xmath252 .",

    "<S> although it is not possible to derive total torque acting on the planet within the shearing - sheet approximation , the one - sided torque can be very different from the inviscid case , depending on the reynolds number . </S>",
    "<S> this effect has been neglected so far but our results indicate that the interaction between a viscous disk and a planet can be qualitatively different from an inviscid case and the details of the density structure in the vicinity of the planet is critically important . </S>"
