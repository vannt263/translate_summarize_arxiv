    "in a recent review in this journal , he@xcite analyzed several asymptotic methods for strongly nonlinear equations .",
    "one such approach , the so called ritz method , consists mainly in converting the nonlinear differential equation into a newton equation of motion .",
    "thus , by minimization of the action integral for the lagrangian function one obtains an approximate solution to the nonlinear equation that is expected to be optimal from a variational point of view .",
    "obviously , the accuracy of the approximate solution depends heavily on the chosen variational ansatz or trial `` trajectory '' .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyze the ritz method proposed by he@xcite and determine if it is already useful for solving actual nonlinear problems . for the sake of clarity in what follows",
    "we devote a section to each of the problems discussed .",
    "first , he@xcite transforms the equation of motion for the duffing oscillator @xmath0 into the variational integral @xmath1 and concludes that `` it requires that the potential @xmath2 must be positive for all @xmath3 , so an oscillation about the origin will occur only if @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the amplitude of the oscillation '' .",
    "unfortunately , he@xcite does not show the trial function from which he draws that conclusion .",
    "the duffing oscillator has been widely studied and , consequently , its properties are well known@xcite . for example , from straightforward inspection of the potential @xmath6 we already know that there is an unstable equilibrium point at @xmath7 when @xmath8 . on the other hand , when @xmath9 the potential @xmath6 exhibits a local maximum @xmath10 at @xmath7 and two minima of depth @xmath11 symmetrically located at @xmath12 .",
    "if the initial conditions are such that @xmath13 then the oscillation will certainly be about the origin ; otherwise there will be oscillations about one of the two minima .",
    "it is clear that by simple inspection of the potential we obtain much more information that the one derived by he@xcite from the action integral .",
    "therefore , he s application of the ritz method to this model is of no relevance whatsoever .",
    "he@xcite proposed the application of the ritz method to the chemical reaction @xmath14 if @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are the number of molecules of the species @xmath5 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , respectively , at time @xmath20 then he@xcite assumed that @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "if we call @xmath23 , then we conclude that @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is known as the extent of reaction@xcite",
    ". the unique rate of reaction can be defined in terms of the extent of reaction as @xmath26 .",
    "he@xcite further assumed that the rate law is given by @xmath27 at this point we stress the fact that this expression is correct only if the chemical reaction ( [ eq : chemreac ] ) is elementary , otherwise the rate law may be more complicated .",
    "most chemical reactions are not elementary and therefore the reaction order and molecularity do not necessarily agree , as discussed in any book on physical chemistry@xcite or chemical kinetics@xcite .",
    "what is more , the order of reaction may not even be a positive integer@xcite . for concreteness here",
    "we assume that the rate law ( [ eq : rate_law ] ) is correct .",
    "he@xcite obtained an approximate solution to the differential equation ( [ eq : rate_law ] ) by means of the action integral @xmath28 dt   \\label{eq : j}\\ ] ] and the variational ansatz @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a variational parameter .",
    "notice that @xmath31 satisfies the boundary conditions at @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "he@xcite found that the optimal value of the effective first  order rate constant @xmath30 was given by @xmath34 furthermore , he@xcite argued that chemists and technologists always want to know the half  time @xmath35 ( which he called halfway time ) . according to equations ( [ eq : x_var ] ) and ( [ eq : eta ] ) the half ",
    "time is given approximately by @xmath36    according to he@xcite the exact reaction extent for @xmath37 is @xmath38 this result is obviously wrong because it exhibits an unphysical pole at @xmath39 . from this incorrect expression",
    "he@xcite derived a meaningless negative half ",
    "time @xmath40 in order to obtain a reasonable agreement with the variational result ( [ eq : halftime_var ] ) he@xcite then carried out the following wrong calculation @xmath41 in this way he@xcite managed to obtain two unphysical negative half  times that agreed 98% .    disregarding the mistakes outlined above we may ask ourselves whether the approximate variational result may be of any utility to a chemist .",
    "any textbook on physical chemistry@xcite or chemical kinetics@xcite shows that the exact solution to equation ( [ eq : rate_law ] ) is @xmath42 ^{1/(n-1)}}\\right\\ } , \\,n\\neq 1   \\label{eq : x_exact}\\ ] ] and that the exact half  time is given by @xmath43 it is common practice in chemistry to estimate the half ",
    "time from experimental data in order to determine the order of the reaction .",
    "obviously , an inaccurate expression would lead to an inexact order of reaction .",
    "the variational half  time ( [ eq : halftime_var ] ) is reasonably accurate for @xmath37 because it is exact for @xmath44 .",
    "the reason is that the variational ansatz ( [ eq : x_var ] ) is the exact solution for a first ",
    "order reaction when @xmath45 .",
    "notice that equation ( [ eq : eta ] ) leads to such a result when @xmath44 .",
    "we can easily verify that the ratio @xmath46 increasingly deviates from unity as @xmath47 increases .",
    "therefore , @xmath37 ( the only case selected by he@xcite ) is the most favorable case if @xmath47 is restricted to positive integers greater than unity .    the half  time ( or half  life ) is a particular case of partial reaction times",
    ". we may , for example , calculate the time @xmath48 that has to elapse for the number of @xmath5 molecules to reduce to @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "it is not difficult to verify that @xmath51 from the experimental measure of @xmath52 and @xmath53 chemists are able to obtain the reaction order @xmath47 .",
    "however , if they used he s variational expression ( [ eq : x_var ] ) they would obtain @xmath54 that is useless for @xmath55 . according to what we have said above it",
    "is not surprising that this ratio is exact for @xmath44 .",
    "we clearly appreciate that the variational result does not provide the kind of information that chemists would like to have because it only predicts first  order reactions .    from the discussion above we conclude that no chemist will resort to the variational expressions in the study of chemical reactions .",
    "there is no reason whatsoever for the use of an unreliable approximate expression when one has a simple exact analytical one at hand . besides",
    ", we have clearly proved that the variational expressions are utterly misleading .",
    "he@xcite also applied the ritz method to the lambert equation @xmath56 and arrived at the variational formulation @xmath57 by means of the transformation @xmath58 he obtained @xmath59 that leads to the euler  lagrange equation @xmath60 obviously , the solution to this linear equation is straightforward .    if we substitute the transformation @xmath58 into equation ( [ eq : lambert_y ] ) we obtain equation ( [ eq : lambert_z ] ) in a more direct way . therefore , there is no necessity for the variational ritz method .",
    "he@xcite also studied the kdv equation @xmath61 and looked for its travelling  wave solutions in the frame @xmath62 the function @xmath63 satisfies the nonlinear ordinary differential equation @xmath64 where the prime indicates differentiation with respect to @xmath65 . then he@xcite integrated this equation ( taking the integration constant arbitrarily equal to zero ) and obtained @xmath66 by means of the so called semi ",

    "we obtain the same values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 in a more direct way and with less effort .",
    "therefore , there is no need for the variational method for the successful treatment of this problem .",
    "he@xcite also applied the ritz method to the most popular bratu equation @xmath73 that has been studied by several authors@xcite ( and references therein ) . here",
    "we only cite those papers that are relevant to present discussion .",
    "he@xcite derived the action integral @xmath74 and proposed the simplest trial function that satisfies the boundary conditions : @xmath75    curiously , he@xcite appeared to be unable to obtain an exact analytical solution for the integral ; however , it is not difficult to show that @xmath76 we can not exactly solve @xmath77 for @xmath5 but we can solve it for @xmath78 : @xmath79 }   \\label{eq : bratu_lambda}\\ ] ] the analysis of this expression shows that @xmath80 exhibits a maximum @xmath81 at @xmath82",
    ". therefore there are two variational solutions for each @xmath83 , only one for @xmath84 and none for @xmath85 .",
    "this conclusion agrees with the rigorous mathematical analysis of the exact solution@xcite that we will discuss below . besides",
    ", the critical value of the adjustable parameter @xmath86 is also a root of @xmath87 .    the exact solution to the one  dimensional bratu equation  ( [ eq : bratu ] ) is well  known .",
    "curiously enough , he@xcite , deeba et al@xcite , and khury@xcite showed a wrong expression . a correct one is ( notice that one can write it in different ways ) @xmath88 } { \\cosh ( \\theta /2)}\\right\\ }   \\label{eq : bratu_exact}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is a solution to @xmath90 the critical @xmath78value is the maximum of @xmath91 , and we easily obtain it from the root of @xmath92 that is given by @xmath93 the exact critical parameters are @xmath94 and @xmath95 that lead to @xmath96 .",
    "we appreciate that the variational approach provides a reasonable qualitative ( or even semi quantitative ) description of the problem .",
    "we may try a perturbation approach to the bratu equation in the form of a taylor series in the parameter @xmath78 : @xmath97 where , obviously , @xmath98 . from the exact expression we obtain @xmath99",
    "while the variational approach also yields a reasonable result @xmath100 it seems that the ritz method already produces satisfactory results for this kind of two  point boundary value problems .",
    "another simple variational function that satisfies the same boundary conditions is @xmath101 it leads to the following variational integral : @xmath102 \\label{eq : bratu_j(a)_2}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 and @xmath104 stand for the modified bessel and struve functions@xcite , respectively . from the minimum condition we obtain @xmath105 \\right\\ } }   \\label{eq : bratu_lambda_2}\\ ] ] it is not difficult to show that this trial function yields better critical parameters : @xmath106 and @xmath107 . besides",
    ", one can easily derive the approximate perturbation expansion exactly @xmath108 notice that although the coefficient of @xmath78 is not exact the remaining ones are more accurate than those of the preceding trial function .    fig .",
    "[ fig : bratu ] shows the exact slope at origin @xmath109 in terms of @xmath78 and the corresponding estimates given by the two variational functions .",
    "we appreciate that the variational approach proposed by he@xcite yields the solution with smaller @xmath109 ( lower branch ) more accurately than the other one ( upper branch ) .",
    "this comparison between the exact and approximate solutions for a wide range of values of @xmath78 was not carried out before ; he@xcite simply compared the two slopes at origin for just @xmath110 .",
    "the other trial function  ( [ eq : bratu_trial_sin ] ) yields a better overall approximation at the expense of the accuracy for small values of @xmath78 . some more elaborated approaches , like the adomian decomposition method , fail to provide the upper branch@xcite",
    "; therefore , the ritz method seems to be suitable for the analysis of this kind of nonlinear problems .    we may conclude that the ritz variational method provides a useful insight into the bratu equation .",
    "however , one should not forget that there is a relatively simple exact solution to this problem and that the generalization of the approach in the form of a power series proposed by he@xcite @xmath111 may surely lead to rather analytically intractable equations .",
    "historically , scientists have developed perturbational , variational and numerical approaches to solve nontrivial mathematical problems in applied mathematics and theoretical physics . in some cases , where the exact solution exists but",
    "is given by complicated special functions , an approximate simpler analytical solution may nonetheless be of practical utility .",
    "however , he@xcite chose examples where either the ritz method does not provide any useful insight , or the exact analytical solutions are as simple as the approximate ones , or the direct derivation of the exact result is more straightforward than the use of the variational method . from the discussions in the preceding sections",
    "we may conclude that he s application of the ritz variational method@xcite does not show that the approach is suitable for the treatment of nonlinear problems . in most of the cases studied here",
    "the straightforward analysis of the problem yields either more information or the same result in a more direct way .    to be fair we should mention that the ritz variational method provides a reasonable bifurcation diagram by means of relatively simple trial functions as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : bratu ] .",
    "however , even in this case the utility of the approach is doubtful because there exists a remarkably simple analytical solution to that equation .",
    "the treatment of a nontrivial example is necessary to assert the validity of the approach .",
    "he s choice of the rate equation for chemical reactions@xcite is by no means a happy one ( without mentioning the mistakes in the calculations ) . in this case",
    "the exact solution is quite simple and the variational ansatz is unsuitable for practical applications .",
    "we may argue that a trial function with the correct asymptotic behaviour would yield meaningful results .",
    "in fact , it may even produce the exact result ; but one should not forget that such a success would obviously be due to the fact that there exist a remarkably simple exact solution available by straightforward integration .    as said before , present results show that he@xcite failed to prove that the ritz variational method provides a successful way of treating strongly nonlinear problems . of course , the main ideas behind that variational method are correct , and the case of bratu equation suggests that it may be possible to find appropriate trial functions for the successful treatment of some problems .",
    "unfortunately , the remaining he s choices@xcite do not do much to convince one that the method is worthwhile .",
    "he s article@xcite is an example of the kind of poor research papers that have been lately published by some supposedly respectable journals .",
    "it is part of such journals policy to reject comments that can reveal this unfortunate situation .",
    "one may ask oneself what is the profit that those journals get from such a practice .",
    "if the reader is interested in other examples of poor research papers in supposedly respectable journals i suggest some earlier reports in this forum@xcite ."
