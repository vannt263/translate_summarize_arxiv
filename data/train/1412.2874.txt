    "the energy density of galactic cosmic rays ( crs ) around the earth is explained if 110  % of supernova explosion energy is used for cr acceleration .",
    "the cr production efficiency in the supernova remnants ( snrs ) has been widely discussed and seems to be ubiquitously so high that the back reaction of crs onto the background shock structure is significant .",
    "one way to estimate the cr production efficiency is through a combination of measurements of the proper motion of the shock front and the temperature of shocked gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "note that @xmath3 can be related to @xmath5 which was given by equation  ( 22 ) of @xcite , as @xmath6 .",
    "observations of the northeast region of the young snr rcw 86 gives us an example .",
    "the proper motion velocity of the synchrotron x - ray filaments is measured as @xmath7  km  s@xmath8 @xcite , while those of the h@xmath0 filaments range from 300 to 3000  km s@xmath8 with a mean of 1200  km  s@xmath8 @xcite .",

    "if the proper motion velocity is equivalent to the shock velocity , then the downstream proton temperature is predicted by the rankine - hugoniot relation as @xmath9  kev .",
    "this value is different from the direct measurement , @xmath10  kev , which is given by the line width of the broad component of the @xmath11 emission @xcite .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath12  % which suggests extremely efficient cr acceleration .",
    "even if the shock velocity is as low as 1200  km  s@xmath8 , the efficiency is 18  % .    in previous discussions",
    ", it was assumed that the shock was plane parallel  that is , that the shock normal is parallel to the flow  and that the measured proper motion velocity was identical to the shock velocity .",
    "these assumptions would be suitable for a spherically symmetric shock wave propagating into a homogeneous medium .",
    "however , they may not be true for actual snrs .",
    "the observed velocity of the proper motion of h@xmath0 filaments is dispersed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which implies shock propagation through an inhomogeneous medium . at present",
    ", it is widely accepted that the interstellar medium is highly inhomogeneous ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in particular , near the young snrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "so far , we have investigated the effects of upstream inhomogeneity and shown that various observational results can be explained @xcite .",
    "some predictions of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) simulations regarding magnetic field amplification due to a turbulent dynamo downstream @xcite , have been observationally confirmed @xcite . in this paper , we will show that the above approximations may lead to overestimates of the cr production efficiency in snrs . in order to study the influence of upstream inhomogeneities ,",
    "we perform a three - dimensional ( 3d ) mhd simulation of a shock wave propagating into an inhomogeneous medium , and we simulate h@xmath0 filaments whose proper motion is synthetically measured .",
    "multi - dimensional mhd simulations of shock propagation through an inhomogeneous diffuse ism with a kolmogorov - like density power spectrum have shown that the shock front is rippled due to the fluctuating inertia of the preshock ism ( see giacalone & jokipii 2007 for the 2d case and inoue et al .",
    "2013 for the 3d case ) .",
    "their results strongly suggest that a snr forward shock is locally oblique . for oblique shocks , the downstream temperature is given by the velocity component normal to the shock surface @xmath13 ( not the shock velocity itself ) : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the boltzmann constant and proton mass , respectively . the velocity measured by the proper motion is identical to the shock velocity component transverse to line of sight ( los ) .",
    "thus , when the shock front is rippled , the proper motion velocity , @xmath17 , can be larger than @xmath13 . in figure [ fig1]a",
    ", we illustrate this situation .",
    "the blue curved sheet represents part of the rippled shock front emitting h@xmath0 photons .",
    "as seen in the bottom of the figure , the limb brightening effect causes a peaked profile in the surface brightness on the celestial sphere @xcite . as the shock propagates",
    ", the peak of the brightness moves outward ( red sheet ) , which is observed as proper motion in the celestial sphere ( magenta vector ) . since @xmath18 , the downstream temperature calculated based on the proper motion measurement can be overestimated , i.e. , @xmath19 , so that @xmath3 is apparently non - zero in spite of no cr acceleration . in the following , using the result of a 3d mhd simulation of a shock propagating through an inhomogeneous medium performed by @xcite ,",
    "we demonstrate that the above expectation is generally realized .",
    "in this paper , we use the data from the simulation performed by @xcite . here , we briefly summarize the set up of the simulation by @xcite .",
    "they studied shock propagation into an inhomogeneous medium that is parameterized by the amplitude of the density fluctuation @xmath20 assuming ideal mhd with adiabatic index @xmath21 and a mean molecular weight of 1.27 , where @xmath22 is the initial mean density and @xmath23 is the dispersion .",
    "the fluctuations are given as a superposition of the sinusoidal functions with various wave numbers ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the simulation is performed in a cubic numerical domain with volume @xmath25 which is resolved by @xmath26 unit cells .",
    "the power spectrum of the density fluctuations is given by the isotropic power law , @xmath27 for the above range of @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the fourier component of the density .",
    "the above kolmogorov spectrum is consistent with the observed big - power - law - in - the - sky @xcite .",
    "the initial mean number density , thermal pressure , and magnetic field strength are set to be @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "these are the typical values in the diffuse ism @xcite .",
    "thus , the initial mean sound speed and @xmath33 velocity are @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively . to induce a blast wave shock",
    ", we set the hot plasma to @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 at the @xmath39 boundary plane .",
    "the resulting mean propagation speed of the shock is 1800 km s@xmath8 , which is suitable for studying young snrs , although the local shock velocity has a large dispersion due to the shock rippling .    in this paper",
    ", we use data from the simulation for @xmath40 , which can be regarded as a typical ism model .",
    "the reason for this is as follows .",
    "if we suppose that the turbulence in the ism is driven by supernovae , then the driving scale of the turbulence and the degree of density fluctuation at the driving scale would be given as @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in that case , the degree of small - scale density fluctuations due to the cascade of the turbulence at the scale @xmath43 is estimated as @xmath44 .",
    "in this section , we show our simulation results .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig2 ] represents the two - dimensional slice of the proton temperature ( _ upper half _ ) and the number density ( _ lower half _ ) in the @xmath45 yr and @xmath46 pc plane . the proton temperature is estimated from @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the pressure and density . from figure [ fig2 ] , we observe that shock waves propagate into the realistic ism with various angles and velocities . as a result ,",
    "the temperature distribution is inhomogeneous ( see the black curve of figure [ fig3 ] ) . in this inhomogeneous system",
    ", it may be that the relation between the proper motion velocity of h@xmath0 and the downstream temperature does not satisfy the rankine - hugoniot relations .    in order to estimate the deviation from the rankine - hugoniot relations , we calculate the proper motion of the h@xmath0 emission over 10  yr ( from @xmath50 to 710  yr ) .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission observed from snrs sometimes has narrow and broad components .",
    "the former is a characteristic of the cold interstellar medium which arises from direct excitation of the neutral hydrogen atoms crossing the shock surface .",
    "the latter is a characteristic of the thermal broadening of the shocked protons which arises from hot hydrogen atoms generated by a charge exchange reaction between cold neutrals and the shocked protons . in this paper , we calculate only the narrow component of the h@xmath0 emission from our mhd simulation because the broad component of h@xmath0 is not necessarily observed from snrs .",
    "we consider hydrogen atoms , electrons , and protons as particles .",
    "the results of our mhd simulation are valid as long as the ionization fraction of the upstream gas is sufficiently high because our mhd simulation does not take into account the ionization of neutral hydrogen atoms .",
    "recent studies have shown that the ionization of neutral hydrogen atoms changes the collisionless shock structures @xcite .",
    "therefore , we consider a highly ionized upstream gas in this paper because the effects of ionization can be neglected .    according to @xcite , the rate ( in units of @xmath51 ) that hydrogen atoms ( denoted @xmath52 ) will have a reaction @xmath53 ( @xmath54 and ce for excitation , ionization , and charge exchange ) with particles of type @xmath55 ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 for electrons and protons , respectively ) is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 are the number density , the velocity , and the distribution function for _ particle _ @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "the velocity and distribution function of hydrogen atoms are described as @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively . the relative velocity between neutral hydrogen atoms and _ particle _ @xmath55 is denoted by @xmath64 .",
    "we assume that distribution functions for each particle are represented by @xmath65 where @xmath66 , and @xmath67 is the downstream fluid velocity .",
    "we regard the distribution function of hydrogen atoms as a dirac delta function because we only consider the narrow component .",
    "in addition , we assume that the distribution functions of protons and electrons are maxwellian with @xmath47 and @xmath68 , respectively citepohira07,ohira08,rakowski08 . in order to calculate equation ( [ reaction ] ) ,",
    "we use our mhd simulation data for @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , as well as the data of @xcite for cross sections . calculating the excitation rate , @xmath72 , for each cell of our mhd simulation and integrating @xmath73 along the los ( z axis )",
    ", we obtain the surface emissivity of the h@xmath0 emission , @xmath74 where we consider only direct excitation from the ground state to the @xmath75 level .",

    "for the initial hydrogen density , @xmath80 , we assume that the initial ionization fraction of the ism is uniform . the bottom panel of figure [ fig2 ] is the h@xmath0 image obtained from equations  ( [ reaction])([ionization ] ) .    as shown in the bottom panel of figure [ fig2 ] , we select 16 regions which contain clear filamentary structure of h@xmath0 to measure proper motion .",
    "we extract a surface brightness profile from these regions and analyze their proper motions in the same way as @xcite . to measure the proper motion , we shift the normalized profiles over one another in steps of one bins , calculating the @xmath81 values for each shift .",
    "the length of one bin is taken as @xmath82 cm , which is comparable to the angular resolution of the optical instrument for the typical distance to the source of a few kiloparsecs .",
    "the best - fitting shift is determined by fitting a parabola to the three @xmath81 values surrounding the minimal @xmath81 .",
    "we estimate the 1@xmath83 uncertainties on the best - fit proper motion , which correspond to @xmath84 .",
    "then , the best - fit proper motion velocity @xmath85 is related to @xmath86 as @xmath87 , which is the same way as in previous actual observational studies .    in order to evaluate @xmath3 from equation  ( [ eta ] )",
    ", we calculate the downstream proton temperature @xmath88 in two ways .",
    "first , we take @xmath88 as the mean of the downstream temperatures of fluid cells just behind the shock surface of the los crossing the h@xmath0 filament ( case  1 ) . as a typical example , in figure  [ fig3 ] , we show the distributions of the proton temperature @xmath2 of the fluid cell just behind the shock surface ; the black curve represents for the whole shock surface , while the blue represents for the surface on the los crossing the h@xmath0 filament of region  3 .",
    "note that the proper motion velocity of region  3 corresponds to the mean of our 16 regions ( see table  [ tb1 ] ) .",
    "the vertical magenta line represents @xmath1 for region  3 with the magenta belt showing the associated error .",
    "the value of @xmath1 is higher than the mean of @xmath2 .",
    "we calculate , from equation  ( [ eta ] ) , the apparent cr production efficiency as @xmath89 .",
    "next , we consider a situation similar to actual observations where the downstream temperature @xmath2 is estimated from the line width of the broad h@xmath0 component ( case  2 ) .",
    "it is hard to calculate exactly the broad emission component in our model .",
    "instead , we perform a simple , approximate calculation . we obtain @xmath88 from the fwhm of the sum of the shifted maxwellian weighted by the brightness of the broad h@xmath0 component , @xmath90 , of the fluid cell at @xmath79 just behind the shock surface on the los crossing the h@xmath0 filament , where @xmath91^{-1}$ ] .",
    "then , we find that @xmath3 becomes slightly larger than for case  1 ( table [ tb1 ] ) .",
    "this is because the hot hydrogen atom emitting the broad h@xmath0 component is generated by a charge exchange reaction , whose cross - section decreases rapidly if the relative velocity is higher than @xmath92  km  s@xmath8 .",
    "thus , the observed downstream temperature may be biased against the particular temperature .",
    "this effect has already been investigated for a one - dimensional shock wave through detailed analysis of h@xmath0 emission @xcite .",
    "since a rippled shock front generates dispersion in the downstream fluid velocity , one might consider that the line width to be spread by downstream bulk motion .",
    "if this doppler effect were significant , then the measured @xmath2 would tend to be higher than the actual downstream proton temperature , resulting in lower @xmath3 .",
    "however , this is not the case for our present synthetic observation .",
    "it is known for oblique shocks that in the upstream rest frame , the downstream fluid velocity @xmath93 is parallel to the shock normal ( figure  [ fig1]b ) .",
    "hence , if the rippled shock front is viewed nearly edge - on as in the present case , then the doppler broadening is not so significant .",
    "table  [ tb1 ] shows the measured proper motion velocity and apparent cr production efficiency @xmath3 for the 16 regions . as expected in section  2",
    ", @xmath86 is higher than @xmath2 and the efficiency @xmath3 is positive , even though our simulations do not involve the effects of comic - ray acceleration .",
    "we have shown that the cr production efficiency @xmath3 seems to be overestimated in the shock wave of snrs propagating into a realistic ism if the post - shock temperature @xmath1 is estimated from the proper motion of the h@xmath0 filaments in combination with the rankine - hugoniot relation for a plane - parallel shock .",
    "it may not be a suitable assumption for actual snr shocks that the shock wave is plane parallel and that the measured proper motion velocity is equivalent to the shock velocity .",
    "density fluctuations of a realistic ism make the rippled , locally oblique shock front almost everywhere . for the oblique shocks",
    ", the post - shock temperature is given not by the shock velocity itself but by the velocity component normal to the shock surface @xmath13 as shown by equation  ( [ jump condition ] ) . because proper motion measurements give us the velocity component transverse to the los ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) , the predicted post - shock temperature @xmath86 given by the rankine - hugoniot relation with the assumption of a plane parallel shock is larger than actual downstream temperature @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , we claim that the cr production efficiency @xmath3 has some uncertainty and can be positive ( up to 0.4 in our case ) despite no cr acceleration .    as shown in the appendix , a simple analytical argument gives the upper and lower bounds of @xmath3 as @xmath94 where @xmath20 is the upstream density fluctuation at the scale @xmath95  pc .",
    "since we have set @xmath40 in our present simulation study , this analytical formula is roughly consistent with our numerical result .",
    "rcw  86 is likely a snr expanding in the windblown bubble @xcite , and a part of the shock collided with dense clumps and/or a cavity wall very recently @xcite so that we expect a larger value of @xmath20 than that of the ism .",
    "if the cr acceleration is inefficient so that the nonlinear effect can be neglected , then we expect @xmath96 in order to explain the observational result @xmath970.9 ( see section  1 ) . on the other hand , shock deformation in @xmath98  pc scale may be smaller for snrs such as sn  1006 , tycho s remnant , and snr  050967.5 , which are embedded in the ism with smaller @xmath20 than rcw  86 . the global h@xmath0 image of sn  1006",
    ", whose radius is about 10  pc , looks like a circular ring except for the northwest region , while smaller - scale ( @xmath99 a few parsecs ) rippling can also be seen @xcite .",
    "tycho s remnant has a radius of about 3  pc , and its whole h@xmath0 shape is no longer circular @xcite .",
    "indeed , several observational results have indicated the inhomogeneity of the ambient medium around sn  1006 @xcite and tycho s remnant @xcite .",
    "snr  050967.5 is also round in shape with a radius of 3.6  pc , however , the southwest part of the remnant is rippled and has many h@xmath0 filaments ( see , e.g. , fig .  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "these observational results for h@xmath0 morphology on a few parsecs or smaller scale are consistent with our model with a typical ism density fluctuation .",
    "therefore , we should still pay attention to the effect of upstream inhomogeneity when the cr acceleration efficiency is discussed in these remnants . in order to reproduce the morphology of the whole remnant and the smaller - scale structure simultaneously ,",
    "we require larger - scale simulation , keeping the same spatial resolution as in the present study , which is currently difficult due to the limitation of computer resources and must remains a future work .    at oblique shocks , the upstream velocity component parallel to the shock front is not dissipated across the shock . for the case of an edge - on view of the rippled shock , such a component mainly turns out to be transverse to the los in the downstream region ( see figure  1(a ) ) , so that it becomes an unseen , missing component it does not even contribute to the width of the broad h@xmath0 line . in previous observational arguments , the missing energy was attributed to cr acceleration . in the present case ,",
    "the post - shock fluid stream lines become `` turbulence '' after the crossing time of the shock rippling scale ( the driving scale of `` turbulence '' ) .",
    "note that this driving scale @xmath100 0.1 pc ( inoue et al . 2013 ) is much larger than the typical width of the emission region , indicating that turbulent line broadening can not be measured by h@xmath0 emission .",
    "since the downstream turbulence is created by the effect of the rippled shock wave @xcite , the induction of the turbulence can be understood as a consequence of crocco s theorem in hydrodynamics .",
    "the strength of the induced turbulence depends on the degree of the density inhomogeneity in the pre - shock medium . in @xcite",
    ", we found that the velocity dispersion of the turbulence can be well described by a formula obtained from the modified growth velocity of the richtmyer  meshkov instability as a function of the upstream density dispersion .",
    "one can also find from the synthetic h@xmath0 image ( bottom panel of figure  [ fig2 ] ) that regions  16 precede regions  912 , so that one might think that the proper motion velocities of regions  16 are higher than those of regions  912 .",
    "however , this is not true ( see table  1 ) .",
    "we find the outermost parts of the h@xmath0 filament do not always have the fastest shock velocity or the highest downstream temperature .",
    "this is because the shock front has effective surface tension and is stable with respect to the rippling deformations .",
    "thus , even though some regions of the shock front are decelerated ( accelerated ) due to the passage of the dense ( thin ) region , they will be accelerated ( decelerated ) once the dense ( thin ) region passes into the downstream region .    in the present analysis , we have seen @xmath101 ( that is , @xmath102 ) for all 16  regions , which implies that the proper motion velocity @xmath17 is larger than the velocity component normal to the shock surface @xmath103 .",
    "we have set our los orthogonal to the global direction of the shock propagation .",
    "however , when the shock wave propagates nearly toward us ( along the los ) , @xmath17 can be smaller than @xmath103 .",
    "for example , @xcite measured the proper motion velocity of h@xmath0 filaments of the cygnus loop and simultaneously derived the downstream gas temperature from the thermal x - ray spectrum there .",
    "then , they obtained the fraction of the cr pressure @xmath104 to the thermal gas pressure @xmath105 in the downstream region . according to their analysis ,",
    "many h@xmath0 filaments have @xmath106 .",
    "since they assumed a strong shock with a compression ratio of 4 , an adiabatic index of 5/3 , and a temperature equilibrium of @xmath107 , the ratio @xmath108 is related to @xmath3 as @xmath109 here @xmath110 and @xmath111 are downstream electron and ion temperatures , respectively . since @xmath112 is unphysical , @xmath113 means @xmath114 , that is , @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , the observational result for the cygnus loop might be explained by our model .",
    "moreover , it is suggested that the proper motion velocity is underestimated due to the shock obliqueness .",

    "the characteristic size of the clumps @xmath118 is the same as their separation . in the present case",
    ", @xmath118 is on the order of @xmath95  pc .",
    "initially , the planar shock surface collides with the clumps .",
    "its propagation speed in the clumps @xmath119 is slower than that in the underdense gas @xmath120 , so that the shock surface is deformed .",
    "assuming momentum conservation , these are related as @xmath121 then , we find @xmath122 for small @xmath20 . as the shock front goes ahead a distance @xmath118 in the underdense gas , the shock surface in the clumps is left at a distance @xmath123 behind the preceding surface in the underdense gas .",
    "therefore , one derives the deformation angle @xmath124 , which is an angle between the shock velocity @xmath125 and the shock normal ( see the right panel of figure  1 ) , as @xmath126 .",
    "the downstream temperature @xmath2 is predominantly determined by the overdense clump , that is , equation  ( [ jump condition ] ) with @xmath127 . for our present geometry ,",
