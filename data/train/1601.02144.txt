    "as reported by @xcite the interstellar medium ( hereafter ism ) is very poor in crystalline solids .",

    "the proto - solar nebula is supposed to have been formed from material coming from the ism . as a consequence , the primordial dust in the solar system",
    "should be composed of amorphous solids except grains which have undergone either a thermal annealing in high temperature regions ( _ i.e. _ around @xmath3 k ) close to the star ( _ i.e. _ @xmath4 au ) or a sequence starting by a vaporization or a melting and finishing by a re - condensation . besides this , comets are presumed to have formed in the cold outer part of the solar nebula along the lines of the scenario recalled below .",
    "+ the dissipation of the early gaseous and dusty protoplanetary disk is presumed to have left a disk of icy planetesimals beyond @xmath5 au . the edgeworth - kuiper belt ( hereafter kb ) and the oort cloud ( hereafter oc ) are the remains of this disk and are the well accepted two main cometary reservoirs @xcite .",
    "a corpus of studies , based on dynamics , show that icy asteroids originally located between @xmath5 au and @xmath6 au have either participated to the formation of giant planets or have been ejected far away because of the planet migration .",
    "the majority of the kb objects have probably been accreted at their current distances ( _ i.e. _ @xmath7 au ) ; but as suggested by results of the nice model , an orbital resonance of saturn and jupiter may have partially filled the kb with objects initially located between @xmath8 au and @xmath6 au @xcite . furthermore , the planetesimals of the inner part of the primordial disk ( _ i.e. _ located in the interval @xmath9 au ) have been likely ejected and finally participated to the formation of the outer regions of the kb and the oc . in summary ,",
    "the crystals have been incorporated into icy planetesimals when they occupied zones from @xmath5 au to @xmath10 au and beyond ; prior to be scattered to the kb and oc .",
    "of course , the transport processes studied in this paper should deposit crystalline dusts at least around @xmath11 au , but the deeper the penetration beyond @xmath11 au will be , the more credible the proposed mechanism will be . the formation of the comets is also believed to have occurred early during the solar system formation .",
    "for instance @xcite showed that the formation of comets could have been completed in @xmath12 years .",

    "+ in this paper , we focus on photophoretic process for which we employ a 1 + 1d accretion disk undergoing a time - dependent irradiation .",
    "indeed , the proto - sun , at the epoch during which it was surrounded by a disk of gas and dust , was evolving through the so - called t tauri phase . the stars belonging to the t tauri class ,",
    "are known to possess an accretion disk and are evolving along the pre - main sequence ( hereafter pms ) tracks where their luminosity could be much higher than that of the sun .",

    "* ) in the disk is still required .",

    "since this phase corresponds to the t tauri period of our star , which is known to be contemporary of the existence of a circumstellar dusty and gaseous accretion disk , our model represents a noticeable improvement of the proto - solar nebula modeling .",
    "this is particularly true in our context , in which we examine the influence of proto - sun radiation on the transport of dust driven by photophoresis .",
    "+ by adopting the same prescription used in previous works for the opacity of the gas , we have found that the high luminosity of the sun considered in its t tauri phase favors the migration of dust grains to the outer parts of the protoplanetary disk . however , the effect is not as high as if the irradiation would not change the disk properties .",
    "indeed , the irradiation enhances the computed turbulent viscosity which in turn increases the accretion velocity .",
    "consequently , the particles are slowed down whereas the disk lifetime is reduced .",
    "this latter effect reduces the need for an _ ad hoc _ photoevaporation in order to get ages in agreement with astronomical observations . unfortunately , since the dust particles have migration velocities that depend on their size , a trail of small grains should be left along the line of sight .",
    "the smallest aggregates show an important contribution to the gas  dust opacity .",
    "this leads to a strong extinction which could eliminate the photophoretic effect .",
    "this point is one of our most important results and , models involving a consistent treatment of the opacity as a function of dust content , are highly desirable .",
    "noticeably , external optically thin disk regions could provide an environment favorable to stellar photons driven transport processes .",
    "in such a case , the net quantity of dust delivered to the comets formation zone could not ba large enough to explain the observations , because of the vertical stratification of grain distribution .",
    "+ besides this , using gas temperature distribution provided by our model , we confirm that amorphous grains can not be annealed into regions beyond @xmath150 au , due to arguments based on phase transition kinetics at gas temperature .",
    "more importantly , we have identified the heat conductivity of aggregates as a crucial parameter . using realistic estimations and",
    "published experimental results for the thermal conductivity , we have shown that the photophoretic strength can be considerably reduced and could yield to situations in which photophoretic migration through the mid - plane could be marginal even if the disk is irradiated by a bright pms star .",
    "+ laboratory experimentations conducted by @xcite on ice aggregates , trapped in a cell under the combined effects of photophoresis and thermophoresis , show that rotation induced by photophoretic forces does not change the strength of photophoresis force , but ignores the influence of a turbulent flow . @xcite and @xcite have discussed , respectively the possible effects of the turbulence and of the particles rotation . however , they considered turbulence and rotation as independent processes .",
    "@xcite , who discussed turbulence as a factor affecting the mean radial motion of dusts , concluded that turbulence essentially does not prevent the outward migration .",
    "@xcite have looked to the influence of rotation of particles on themselves , induced for instance by particle to particle collisions .",
    "we have to keep in mind that dusts are embedded in a gaseous environment , to which they are strongly coupled ( at least in the mid - plane ) . following a simple picture ,",
    "a turbulent flow is made of a cascade of eddies , with a distribution of sizes and lifetimes .",
    "in such a flow , aggregates can meet eddies with rotational motion in a plane that contains the radial direction . in this configuration ,",
    "if the thermal relaxation timescale of the particle is larger than the overturning timescale of the turbulent eddy , the temperature distribution at the surface of the particle could be uniformized , leading to the removal of any photophoretic force . the global effect on dust migration through",
    "the disk depends on the intrinsic properties of dust ( thermal properties and aerodynamics drag ) and on statistical properties of the involved turbulent flow .",
    "the net result will be a convolution of the statistical distribution of grains properties ( bulk material nature , porosity , size , etc ) and of the properties of the cascade of turbulent eddies .",
    "+ in a first approach , the influence of the turbulence on dust trajectories could also be investigated using a particle - tracking technics as already employed in other contexts by @xcite or @xcite .",
    "thanks to this method , applied in a 2d or better a 3d geometry , we could follow the trajectories of particles within the disk and even those that could be launched upwards , pushed outward by the radiation pressure and possibly fall back onto the nebula at different locations . a similar scenario has been already studied by @xcite in their investigations concerning the outward transport of cais during fu - orionis events .",
    "the vertical transport of grains , caused by convection and thermophoresis could be also included together with the existence of a quiet `` dead zone '' in which the turbulent activity should be very low .",
    "our model of accretion disk is basically based on a generalized version of the procedure originally published by @xcite .",
    "more specifically , this is a 1 + 1d model for which the turbulence is treated in the frame of the well known @xmath23 formalism @xcite . during its temporal evolution ,",
    "the disk is irradiated by the star which also evolves along its pre - main sequence evolutionary track .",
    "both static model and disk temporal evolution programs have been implemented from scratch in ` fortran 2008 ` , and parallelized using open multi - processing ( openmp ) .",
    "we have nicknamed the whole package ` evad ` .",
    "the following sections provide a detailled description of our model .",

    "the density is denoted @xmath177 while @xmath178 is the opacity of the disk s material taken in @xcite .",
    "following pt99 the boundary condition at the external disk surface are given by @xmath179 where @xmath180 with @xmath181 ( the disk surface mass density ) and @xmath182 the vertically averaged viscosity .",
    "the pressure at external surface is @xmath183 where @xmath184 is the disk mid - height , @xmath185 is the optical depth above the disk ( following pt99 , we have taken @xmath186 ) and @xmath187 is the opacity at the external surface .",
    "the temperature @xmath31 can be obtained by solving for given values of @xmath23 and @xmath188 @xmath189 where @xmath190 is given by @xmath191 where @xmath35 is given by eq .",

    "i.e. _ the temperature of the medium in which the disk is immersed .",
    "we have chosen @xmath34 k. the mid - height of the disk being not known a priori , we have to solve a two boundary value problems ( tbvp ) .",
    "while some authors work with relaxation algorithms @xcite ; we have prefered an algorithm based on shooting methods @xcite turning our tbvp into an initial values problems ( ivp ) : the equations of the vertical structure are integrated from the surface of the disk to the mid - plan . the 5th - order runge - kutta method with adaptive step length described in @xcite , already used in previous other works",
    "( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , has been employed to perform the vertical integration . to reduce the effects of the stiffness of the set of equations , we have opted for after several tests the set of variables",
    "@xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath194 ( also adopted by * ? ? ?",
    "the equation @xmath195 is then solved by a root finding method .",
    "finally , the vertically averaged turbulent viscosity @xmath196 is tabulated as a function of disk surface density @xmath197 , the steady state accretion rate @xmath198 , the turbulent viscosity parameter @xmath23 and the age of the system @xmath39 ( _ i.e. _ providing @xmath38 and @xmath37 which are directly involved in the calculation . during the integration of the eq .",
    "( [ eq_evol ] ) , these pre - built tables are interpolated `` on - the - fly '' by a dedicated routine involving advanced b - splines technics @xcite",
    ".      the temporal evolution of the disk is governed by eq .",
    "( [ eq_evol ] ) , combined with boundary conditions similar to those used by @xcite , which is a non - linear equation ( @xmath20 depends on the solution @xmath17 ) .",

    "* ) the time - step must meet the courant - friedrichs - lewy condition ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that limits the value of the time - step to small values . instead of an explicit finite difference scheme",
    ", we have chosen a fully implicit scheme which has the great advantage of being unconditionally stable at least in the case of linear equations .",
    "the obtained set of non - linear finite difference equations is solved using a multidimensional newton  raphson algorithm .",
    "our approach is similar to the methods used by @xcite and @xcite , respectively in the contexts of stellar structure or accretion disc outburst .",
    "we used a decentralized finite difference formula @xmath199 where @xmath200 is a chosen function of @xmath19 .",
    "the initial distribution of matter being of the form @xmath201 ; we have found convenient to adopt a function like @xmath202 where @xmath203 is an adjustable real parameter that tunes the distribution of points through the disk .",

    "<S> there is a growing body of evidences for the presence of crystalline material in comets . </S>",
    "<S> these crystals are believed to have been annealed in the inner part of the proto - solar nebula , while comets should have been formed in the outer regions . </S>",
    "<S> several transport processes have been proposed to reconcile these two facts ; among them a migration driven by photophoresis . </S>",
    "<S> the primarily goal of this work is to assess whether disk irradiation by a pre - main sequence star would influence the photophoretic transport . </S>",
    "<S> to do so , we have implemented an evolving 1 + 1d model of an accretion disk , including advanced numerical techniques , undergoing a time - dependent irradiation , consistent with the evolution of the proto - sun along the pre - main sequence . </S>",
    "<S> the photophoresis is described using a formalism introduced in several previous works . adopting the opacity prescription used in these former studies , we find that the disk irradiation enhances the photophoretic transport : the assumption of a disk central hole of several astronomical units in radius is no longer strictly required , whereas the need for an _ ad hoc _ introduction of photoevaporation is reduced . </S>",
    "<S> however , we show that a residual trail of small particles could annihilate the photophoretic driven transport via their effect on the opacity . </S>",
    "<S> we have also confirmed that the thermal conductivity of transported aggregates is a crucial parameter which could limit or even suppress the photophoretic migration and generate several segregation effects .    </S>",
