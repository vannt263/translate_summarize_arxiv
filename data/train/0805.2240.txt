    "projective geometry arose from the need to create three dimensional images in two dimensions .",
    "it differs from euclidean geometry in two fundamental aspects : the existence of ideal points  where parallels meet , and transformations which change both length and angle .",
    "the notion of a ideal point can be traced back to kepler in which an ideal point on each line closes the line into a circle of infinite radius , now called a horocycle . in a perspective drawing all lines in a family of parallels have the same ideal point , known as the horizon .",
    "the question arose as to what remains invariant in a projection since lengths and angles do not .",
    "since three points on a line are not invariant , because it is possible to project them on to another line , the minimum number points needed is four .",
    "but then any other four points projectively related to the original ones will have the same cross - ratio since a projectivity is the product of a sequence of perspectivities .",
    "the invariant cross - ratio is related to the hyperbolic length through its logarithm .",
    "we will evaluate the hyperbolic measure of length in terms of its euclidean measure through the definition of the cross - ratio .",
    "ideal points lie on a circle of radius @xmath0 .",
    "hyperbolic motions are projectivities which are euclidean rotations about the center of the circle  @xcite . the circle whose center is @xmath1 has a euclidean radius @xmath2 , and this is also a hyperbolic circle with the same center but a different radius @xmath3 .",
    "the problem is to express the euclidean measure of distance @xmath4 in terms of the hyperbolic measure @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath5 be the euclidean distance from the origin lying on the same line as the ideal points , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , located on diametrically opposite ends of the circle as shown in figure 1 .",
    "if @xmath8 denotes the euclidean distance between points @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the cross - ratio is : @xmath11    the cross - ratio is related to the distance  @xmath12 in hyperbolic space according to @xmath13 where the scaling constant is included in the nondimensional velocity , @xmath5 .",
    "as the velocity of light tends to infinity , or what is the same @xmath14 , hyperbolic geometry transforms into euclidean geometry .",
    "exponentiating both sides of relates the exponential poincar distance to the radial doppler factor @xmath15 this implies that we should expect a velocity space metric in the case where the euclidean measure of the velocity , @xmath16 , is not constant .",
    "time will act as a magnification factor for the independent velocities rather than as a completely independent coordinate in space - time as in the general  theory of relativity .",
    "if @xmath16 represents the ratio of the velocity of an object to that of light , then it becomes apparent from that light has a finite speed only because we are using a euclidean measure of it .",
    "this restriction disappears when we use a hyperbolic measure of it , as in . solving for the euclidean measure of the velocity in terms of its hyperbolic measure",
    ", we obtain @xmath17 consider the triangle formed by rotating @xmath16 through an angle @xmath18 , as shown in figure 1 . rotations about the origin do not cause deformations , and there is no difference between euclidean and hyperbolic measure of the angle .",
    "the right triangle has a hypotenuse @xmath19 and height @xmath20 .",
    "the cosine of the angle is the same in both measures @xmath21 however , the opposite angle , @xmath22 , will undergo a contraction so that it will only be true that @xmath23    in order to determine the relation between @xmath22 and @xmath24 , it is necessary to calculate the height @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the corresponding ideal points by extending the height , @xmath27 , so that it cuts the circle then the cross - ratio is : @xmath28 we thus find the euclidean height in terms of the hyperbolic measure of height as @xmath29 if the rotation occurred about the origin then @xmath30 would have been @xmath31 .",
    "but because the motion is not at the origin , the euclidean length will appear contracted by a factor @xmath32 .",
    "it is precisely this contraction which is responsible for the triangle defect in hyperbolic geometry since @xmath33 since the cosine is a decreasing function on the open interval @xmath34 , it follows that @xmath35 , and this is the origin of the triangle defect in hyperbolic triangles .",
    "it is caused by the motion perpendicular to the direction of motion .",
    "this is the origin of the lorentz contraction in the direction perpendicular to the motion  @xcite .    in hyperbolic geometry ,",
    "the pythagorean theorem , @xmath36 , is converted into @xmath37 because    @xmath38    and both @xmath39 and @xmath40 are both positive functions .",
    "the hyperbolic pythagorean theorem can be used in @xmath41 to get @xmath42    let us now consider what happens in the limits @xmath43 , such that their difference @xmath44 is a positive constant . in this limit , @xmath45    we can consider a more general triangle with sides @xmath30 and @xmath46 , and base @xmath16 .",
    "the altitude @xmath47 cuts the base into two parts @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the angles formed from the sides and the base are @xmath18 and @xmath22 .",
    "the sines of these angles are @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , since deformation only occurs normal to the direction of motion , i.e. , @xmath16 .",
    "introducing the pythagorean theorem of the first triangle , @xmath52 into the pythagorean theorem for the second triangle , @xmath53 results in @xmath54 finally , introducing @xmath55 results in the law of cosines @xmath56 in an exactly analogous way we find @xmath57    now , introducing @xmath55 into @xmath58 results in : @xmath59 but , this should be a velocity composition law , and it will become one when we introduce the velocity components @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "introducing these definitions into gives @xmath62 in the limit as @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and they become light signals .",
    "the hyperbolic cosine law , can be written as : @xmath65 which is the aberration formula .",
    "taking the differential of , @xmath66 and introducing result in @xmath67 where we used @xmath68 . dividing both sides by the time increment gives the doppler shift as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the doppler factor .",
    "a moving object that emits a signal at frequency @xmath71 with velocity @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is the frequency with the observer at rests registers . if the signal is emitted at the velocity of light , @xmath74 , implying that @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , or equivalently @xmath77 , then it follows from that @xmath78 such that the difference @xmath44 remains finite , i.e. , @xmath79 the doppler shift then becomes the _ exponential _ doppler shift @xmath80    ordinarily , one writes the doppler factor with @xmath74 without realizing that it requires the limit @xmath75 , which , in turn , requires that it be perpendicular to the motion .",
    "moreover , is the well - known expression for angle of parallelism : the ratio of concentric limiting arcs between two radii is the exponential distance between the arcs divided by the radius of curvature .",
    "with the realization that there is no such thing as a rigid body in relativity , whithrow  @xcite went on to develop a radar method , or what he called a signal - function method   where light signals are transmitted between different inertial frames , and non - inertial ones .",
    "it was afterwards referred to as the @xmath81-calculus technique  by bondi  @xcite , although milne  @xcite used it extensively in his research prior to him .      as in kinematical relativity",
    "@xcite , time measurements are much more fundamental than distance measurements , the latter being deducible from the former . in other words ,",
    "distances are measured by the elapse of time .",
    "this has been criticized by born  @xcite as being impractical since no one has ever received light signals from nebulae beyond the horizon .",
    "however , it is far superior to the usual method in general relativity that uses a metric , or rigid ruler , to measure distance  @xcite .",
    "what was discarded in special  relativity made its come back in general  relativity .",
    "the most ideal situation would be to introduce into the fabric of the theory distances measured in brightness , or the difference between apparent and absolute brightness .",
    "however , no one has succeeded in doing so and we will base all distance measurements on the so - called radar method  @xcite , where a light signal is sent out and reflected at a later time .",
    "all that is needed is that at each reflection a certain factor @xmath81 comes in which is determined by the clock in the frame that is sending out the light pulse .    for consider two observers , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "observer @xmath82 sends out a light signal in his time @xmath84 which is received by observer @xmath83 in his time @xmath85 . in terms of @xmath82 s time",
    ", @xmath83 will receive it in @xmath86 , where @xmath81 is some constant factor that is a function only of the relative velocity of the two frames .",

    "the reflected signal passes @xmath83 in time @xmath87 which arrives at observer @xmath82 in time @xmath88 , where @xmath89 . from this",
    "it is apparent that both observers will call the reflection time @xmath90 which is the geometric mean of the time intervals , and it is an invariant independent of the frame .",
    "so the signal - function method  of whithrow singles out the geometric mean as the time of reflection .",
    "the reading shown by a synchronous ( stationary ) clock at the event should be midway between the observer s time , @xmath84 , of sending out the signal , and the time he receives its reflection , @xmath91 , viz .",
    ", @xmath92 this was einstein s choice , but it by no means is the only choice  @xcite .",
    "the measure of the space interval is the difference between the average  for the light - signalling process , , and the time the signal was sent out @xmath93    in terms of @xmath83 s coordinates , he will measure a time interval @xmath94 and a space interval @xmath95 separating the event from where he is located .",
    "the two systems of inertial coordinates @xmath96 and @xmath97 are related by :    @xmath98    the time @xmath99 is the time on @xmath83 s clock when the signal is received , and @xmath100 is the moment on @xmath83 s clock when it is sent back .",
    "suppose , for the moment , we place ourselves at the origin of @xmath83 s frame . then summing and gives @xmath101 showing that a clock traveling at a uniform velocity goes slower than one at rest .",

    "@xmath112 a space - time interval has been transformed into a velocity space - time interval .",
    "it is generally acknowledged that acceleration has no effect on the rate of a clock @xcite , and that the expression for time - dilatation can be used in its infinitesimal form whether or not @xmath16 is constant .",
    "however , according to einstein s equivalence principle uniform acceleration is equivalent to , or indistinguishable from , a uniform gravitational field .",
    "it has been shown from the gravitational red - shift that the latter , indeed , has an effect on the rate of a clock .",
    "this contradiction has been clearly pointed out by whithrow @xcite , who shows that the time - dilatation is greater when the velocity is varying with time than when it is constant .",

    "the velocity components are related to the sides of a lambert quadrilateral whose weierstrass coordinates of the point of the acute angle show that the geometric mean time enters as a magnification of these coordinates , and not as a separate entity .",
    "most importantly , by avoiding the rigid scaffolding  employed by einstein , which is applicable to inertial frames of reference only  @xcite , acceleration has been accounted for as changes in velocity space , where the independence of the coordinates  and time has disappeared .",
