    "emitting galaxies ( laes ) generally are relatively small @xcite of low ( specific ) star formation rate @xcite , our lack of knowledge is in part due to the difficulties in observing faint galaxies .",
    "this obstacle may to some extend be overcome using gravitationally lensed laes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and clustering properties @xcite may overcome some of these complications , although still our ignorance of rt processes easily may result in systematic errors . a common technique by which to assess the stellar population of individual galaxies at high redshifts is to measure the equivalent width ( ew ) @xmath1 of the ly@xmath0  line ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this quantity is defined as the ratio of the integrated line flux to continuum flux density , @xmath2/\\!f_0 $ ] , where the exact limits of the integral are not important , as long as the full line is included . for sloped continua , the wavelength dependency of the continuum",
    "must also be taken into account .",
    "for high ews , @xmath1 can be approximated by the relative escape fraction of ly@xmath0  and continuum photons .",
    "the ew depends on galactic parameters such as the initial mass function ( imf ) and the gas metallicity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and can consequently be used as a probe of these quantities .    in young galaxies ,",
    "ly@xmath0  is produced mainly from recombinations following the ionization of hydrogen surrounding o and b stars .",
    "since these stars are short - lived , a few myr after an initial starburst the ew will generally decrease significantly .",
    "stellar population syntheses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predict that the ew should initially reach @xmath3  , eventually declining and settling on roughly 80  , where the exact values depend on the assumed imf and metallicity of the population .",
    "curiously , several observational studies have reported on the detection of much higher ews ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while some of these extreme ew galaxies can be attributed to agn activity , in many cases this explanation is explicitly excluded",
    "moreover , such high ews are not readily explained by simply assuming a more top - heavy imf .",
    "indeed , the observations pose a serious challenge to our understanding of both galaxy formation , stellar evolution , and radiative transfer .    in this work",
    ", we will distinguish between three related notations .",
    "the equivalent width @xmath4  of the _ intrinsically _ emitted spectrum is given by the stellar population ; for instance , a more top - heavy imf emits a harder spectrum , with relatively more ionizing and hence ly@xmath0photons .",
    "when escaping the galaxy , the spectrum has an equivalent width @xmath5 ; as we shall see below , the ism may possess the ability of transferring an uneven fraction of ly@xmath0  vs.  continuum photons , making @xmath5  larger or smaller than @xmath4 .",
    "finally , as the total number of photons in a line is conserved when traveling through the universe , whereas the number of continuum photons per wavelength bin is reduced as they are cosmologically redshifted , the _ observed _ equivalent width @xmath6  from a source at redshift @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 .      as ly@xmath0  photons scatter on neutral hydrogen , their path length before escaping a galaxy will always be longer than that of continuum radiation .",
    "thus , the immediate corollary is that ly@xmath0  will be more susceptible to dust absorption than the continuum , implying that @xmath9 .",
    "however , ( * ? ?",
    "* hereafter n91 ) investigated analytically the resonant scattering of ly@xmath0photons through the ism and found that under special circumstances , the ly@xmath0  photon may actually suffer _ less _ attenuation than radiation which is not resonantly scattered , e.g.  continuum radiation .",
    "considered the escape of radiation from the center of a plane - parallel , two - phase structure , in which sperical clouds of homogeneously mixed neutral hydrogen and dust lie embedded within a virtually empty intercloud medium ( icm ) .",
    "the number density of clouds are assumed to be small enough that they do not touch , yet sufficiently numerous that they cover most of the sky .",
    "furthermore , the source of both ly@xmath0  and continuum photons is assumed to be pointlike and situated in the center of the slab , in the icm . under these conditions showed that ly@xmath0  photons , upon entering a cloud , scatters only a few times before returning to the icm , thereby being exposed arbitrarily little to absorption by dust .",
    "consequently , the journey of the ly@xmath0  photons will be confined primarily to the dustless icm , preserving the total ly@xmath0  luminosity .",
    "in contrast , the continuum radiation which penetrates the clouds rather than scattering off of their surfaces will be subject to the full attenuation , given by the optical depth of dust from the center and out .",
    "thus , since the continuum is reduced while the line is more or less preserved , the ew of the escaping radiation can be `` boosted '' to arbitrarily high values .",
    "we define such a boost as @xmath10 of course , the boost does not imply an increased ly@xmath0  luminosity , but rather a reduced continuum luminosity .",
    "the mere potential of an ew boost was the conclusion of s studies .",
    "* hereafter ho06 ) studied the scenario in more detail , both analytically and numerically .",
    "in addition to confirming the boost , they also looked into the effect of galactic outflows of clumpy gas on the line profile , exploring the rt in various geometries .",
    "while  did investigate various extensions of the neufeld scenario , one of their main conclusion was the same as : `` if most of the dust resides in a neutral phase which is optically thick to ly@xmath0 , the ly@xmath0  ew can be strongly enhanced '' .",
    "the results of  and  seem a natural explanation of the unusually high observed ews , and lately such observations has routinely been interpreted within the framework of this scenario , inferring the presence , or non - presence , of a clumpy , dusty ism .",
    "thus , @xcite and lately @xcite , interpret the fact that ly@xmath0radiation is visible from @xmath11% of a sample of sub - mm galaxies as suggesting the presence of very patchy and inhomogeneous dust distribution .",
    "@xcite regards a clumpy ism as a possible explanation of their high ly@xmath0  ews , and in @xcite propose a parameter @xmath12 to characterize clumpiness , such that ly@xmath0  is attenuated by a factor @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the dust optical depth for non - resonant photons close to the ly@xmath0line . for a given ly@xmath0",
    "they then calculate the clumpiness of the ism , positing that for @xmath15 the ew is boosted due to dust clumpiness .",
    "this method is further used in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to infer various degrees of clumpiness in observed laes .",
    "a equivalent approach was followed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite has invoked a clumpy ism scenario in order to match their simulated lae lfs to observed ones .",
    "however , the idealized conditions under which a boost may be achieved is rarely taken into account .",
    "accordingly , we believe that a revision of the scenario is timely , and in the present work we aim to investigate the validity of the various premises of the model . we do this by calculating numerically the rt of ly@xmath0  and continuum in model galaxies constructed to cover a broad range of plausible as well as implausible systems .",
    "in addition to the work of  and , the topic of resonant scattering in a multiphase medium has received attention from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . of these , only @xcite concern themselves with the relative escape fraction of ly@xmath0  and continuum , and found tentative evidence for the impracticability of enhancing the ly@xmath0  ew , by investigating the ly@xmath0  and continuum rt in an expanding shell of clumps with different values of dust optical depth , expansion velocity ,  density , and line width .",
    "they found that indeed a virtually empty icm was needed , along with only modest outflow velocities and high , for an ism geometry to result in a boost .    after describing the principles of the applied numerical code in sec .",
    "[ sec : rt ] , we systematically vary all parameters relevant for decribing a ( model ) galaxy in sec .  [",

    "regarded each dusty cloud as a scattering particle itself , with a certain probability of absorbing a photon .",
    "when  developed their numerical model , they followed the same approach .",
    "they used a monte carlo code , where the path of individual photons were traced as they traveled through the icm , but whenever a cloud was encountered , the photon would simply be absorbed or scattered at once in some direction away from the cloud .",
    "the appropriate probability density functions ( pdfs ) were calculated on beforehand from fits to a series of rt calculations of photons incident on a cloud surface .",
    "this rendered feasible simulations that were otherwise impractical . in the almost seven years that have passed since",
    ", computational power has increased to a point that `` brute force '' simulations can in fact be performed rather effortlessly , obliviating the need for several approximations .    in the present work ,",
    "the rt calculations are conducted using the numerical code mocalata  @xcite . in the following ,",
    "the basics of the code are outlined :    the galaxy is constructed on a grid of cells , each of which holds a value of the physical parameters important to the rt ; the neutral hydrogen density @xmath16 , the dust density @xmath17 , the gas temperature @xmath18 , and the three - dimensional velocity @xmath19 of the gas elements .",
    "the original neufeld scenario concerned itself with radiation escaping from a slab of gas . for numerical reasons ,",
    "higher resolution can be achieved considering radiation escaping a _ sphere _ of multiphase gas , as did also .",
    "qualitatively , and even quantitatively except for factors of order unity , the results are equivalent .",
    "thus , a galaxy is modeled as a number @xmath20 of spherical , non - overlapping clouds with radius @xmath21 , dispersed randomly within a sphere of radius @xmath22 .",
    "a cell may be either an icm cell or a cloud cell . in order to make the clouds spherical , cells on the border between a cloud and the icm",
    "are adaptively refined , such that a given cell is split into eight subcells , recursively until a satisfactory resolution is achieved .",
    "the structure is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : amr ] , where also a surface brightness map of a simulation is shown .     clouds . the amr structure with six levels of refinement",
    "is illustrated in the inset .",

    "note however that the actual shape of a cloud does not affect the results significantly ; the most important quantities , as identified by , are the cloud albedo , i.e.  the probability that a photon incident on a cloud is reflected rather than absorbed after a number of scatterings , and the average number @xmath29 of clouds with which a ly@xmath0  photon interacts before escaping the galaxy , in the absence of absorption .",
    "this number in turn is a function of the covering factor , which is the average number of clouds intercepted by a sightline from the center and out .",
    "individual ly@xmath0  and continuum photons are then emitted and traced as they scatter in real and frequency space throughout the inhomogeneous ism .",
    "mocalata  has previously been applied to galaxies extracted from cosmological simulations .",
    "although it was tested thoroughly against various analytical solutions in @xcite , some modifications and extensions had to be made in order to use it for the idealized simulations in the present study .",
    "these are described and tested in app .",
    "[ sec : moca ] .    for a given set of parameters @xmath20 , @xmath21 , etc .",
    ", the _ observed _ boost will depend on the direction which it is observed , as well as on the actual random realization of cloud positions . in addition to sampling the average spectrum , i.e.  the spectrum of photons escaping in all directions , mocalata  calculates the spectra escaping exactly in the six different directions along the cartesian axes .",
    "the more clouds a galaxy comprises , the smaller the spread will be in different directions , and for different realizations .",
    "further , the variation between different directions is much larger than between different realizations .",
    "for instance , for a covering factor of @xmath30 , only @xmath31% of the sightlines will actually intercept two clouds , while @xmath32% will intercept no clouds at all ( i.e.  the covering _",
    "fraction _ is @xmath33 for @xmath34 ) , and a non - negligible fraction of the sightlines will intercept @xmath35 clouds .",
    "these three cases will , respectively , result in a boost close to the @xmath36 average , no boost at all , and an essentially infinite boost ( for a central point source ) .",
    "thus , the fractional standard deviation @xmath37 from different viewing angles is typically of order 50% , while for the @xmath36 average of many realizations of the same model , @xmath37 is but a few percent . in the following analysis ,",
    "the presented values of @xmath38 represent the @xmath36 average for a single realization of a given model .",
    "in order to systematize which physical conditions are necessary for boosting the ew , we first settle on a fiducial model . in the subsequent sections , several of the implied parameters are then relaxed or varied , individually or in conjunction . when nothing else is stated , the remaining parameters correspond to the fiducial model .",
    "initially , we will not concern ourselves with the realism of the parameters , instead deferring this discussion to sec .",
    "[ sec : real ] , although we note that several of the chosen values , as well as various derived parameters such as color excess and total galaxy mass , roughly resemble observed typical lae values .",
    "the fiducial model galaxy is a sphere of radius @xmath39 kpc consisting of @xmath40 of clouds of equal radii @xmath41 kpc .",
    "the density of neutral hydrogen in the clouds is @xmath42 , implying a column density @xmath43  as measured from the center to the surface of a cloud .",
    "the clouds are dispersed at random in an empty icm .",
    "the temperatures of the clouds and the icm are @xmath44 and @xmath45 k , respectively .",
    "the physical significance of the clouds and the icm are the interstellar phases conventionally called the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) and the hot ionized medium ( him ) , first identified by @xcite and @xcite , although in reality @xmath46  is usually somewhat smaller than the chosen 1 atom .",
    "finally , in the fiducial model , all photons are emitted in the line center , from the icm in the center of the sphere .",
    "the covering factor  is analogous to an optical depth of clouds intercepted by a sightline from the center of the galaxy and out . with a number density @xmath47 of clouds ,",
    "the covering factor of the fiducial model is then @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 is the cross section of a cloud ) .",
    "since an average sightline passing through a cloud traverses a distance @xmath50 inside the cloud , the total path traveled inside clouds for an average sightline is @xmath51 .    at the heart of the ew boosting mechanism",
    "lies the assumption of the ly@xmath0photons being shielded from the dust by neutral hydrogen while the non - scattered fuv continuum radiation is subject to the `` full '' dust absorption .",
    "hence , the relevant quantity for dust absorption is the total average absorption optical depth @xmath52  of the dust throughout the galaxy .",
    "the dust absorption optical depth of a single cloud ( center - to - face ) is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the total ( absorption + scattering ) dust optical depth , and @xmath55 is the dust albedo .",
    "hence , @xmath56 ( this expression is only approximate , since photons scattering on dust grains may still be subject to absorption by another dust grain before it escapes the galaxy ) .",
    "dust grains are built from metals , and the density of dust is thus assumed to scale with metallicity and hydrogen density . since observationally the optical depth is not readily measured , we will instead refer to the metallicity @xmath57 , which is usually more easily probed .",
    "depending on the actual extinction curve used , the constant of proportionality will differ . furthermore , assuming that the density of dust scales linearly with the metallicity , the dust optical depth can be related to @xmath57 through @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the dust cross section _ per hydrogen nucleus _",
    " specific for a given extinction curve  and @xmath60 is the reference metallicity of that extinction curve .",
    "for example , for smc dust , at the ly@xmath0wavelength the cross section is @xmath61 2 with only a small wavelength depence across the line , and the smc metallicity is @xmath62 .",
    "having explicated the basics of the model , we now proceed to investigate the impact on the boost of varying the implied parameters .      for the neufeld scenario to be efficient , the sky , as seen from the center of the galaxy ,",
    "must be sufficiently covered by clouds .",
    "asserts that the covering factor  must be larger than unity .",
    "in fact , as soon as a single cloud is present , the @xmath36 average will have @xmath63 .",
    "figure [ fig : fc ] shows , for various values of @xmath46  and @xmath57 how the ew boost changes with .     as a function of covering factor @xmath64 , for various values of cloud  densities @xmath46  and metallicites @xmath57 .",
    "lines with the same color share the same value of dust optical depth per cloud : _ blue _ , _ green _ , and _ red _ denote @xmath65 , 0.2 , and 2 , respectively . for these simulations ,",

    "the ly@xmath0photons are exposed to the same amount of extinction , but since @xmath52  is larger , the continuum is reduced more . at fixed @xmath46 , a larger @xmath57 also results in a larger boost due to the higher @xmath52 , but since for each cloud interaction a ly@xmath0  experiences a larger probability of being absorbed , combinations with high @xmath57 have smaller boosts than those with high @xmath46 .",
    "this is especially true at large values of , where the ly@xmath0  photons interact with many clouds .      to shield the ly@xmath0  photon from the dust",
    ", the clouds must be highly optically thick in hydrogen . since non - absorbed photons",
    "are usually reflected after only a handful of scatterings , in principle the clouds could have an optical depth of only a few , although in that case , for realistic metallicites , the dust optical depth would be so low that the continuum passes unhindered through the clouds .    figure [ fig : nhi_cl ] shows how the magnitude of the boost depends on the  ( column ) density of the clouds .",
    "note that for a given series of simulations , the metallicity has been held fixed , meaning that @xmath52  increases with increasing @xmath68 .     as a function of neutral hydrogen column density @xmath68 of the individual clouds , as measured from the center to the surface of a cloud , for different gas metallicites .",

    "the critical value for a noticeable boost is found where @xmath68  and @xmath57 conspire to a dust optical depth of order unity .",
    "for very high values of @xmath68  the clouds become so optically thick in dust to continuum such that the calculated ews become rather noisy .",
    "the density of dust scales both with metallicity and density .",
    "increasing the gas density in the clouds will increase the dust density accordingly .",
    "this does not change the surface of a cloud from the point of view of a ly@xmath0  photon , but the continuum photons experiences a larger total optical depth of dust , and thus the boost increases . for a given  density , increasing the metallicity results in a higher boost .",

    "consequently , the boost does not change for @xmath82 pc , but at lower @xmath21  the number of times that the ly@xmath0  photon interact with clouds ( @xmath29 ) becomes so large that the ly@xmath0  escape fraction decreases considerably , reducing the boost .",
    "the very concept of the boost hinges on the fact that neutral gas shields photons close to the line center from the dust .",

    "figure [ fig : sigv ] demonstrates that this is indeed the case ; for @xmath83 @xmath84 , the fiducial model is seen to be incapable of boosting the ew .",
    "moreover , whereas in the case of @xmath85 a higher covering factor results in a larger boost , introducing random cloud motion reduces the boost even faster ; for  twice that of the fiducial model , the boost vanishes already for @xmath86 @xmath84 .",
    "( _ green _ ) and 4 ( _ red_).,scaledwidth=40.0% ]      increasing the gas temperature @xmath87 in the clouds means less atoms with the right velocity for scattering photons exactly at the line center , in return for more atoms available for scattering off center photons .",
    "photons in the wings of the line , however , do not care about the gas temperature , since the profile here is given by natural broadening .",
    "even so , the difference in the effective cross section of the atoms is not very large .",
    "the consequence is that , for increasing @xmath87 , the photons penetrate slightly deeper into the cloud , but not enough to affect the boost , as seen in fig .  [",

    "gas elements also move in large - scale , collective motions , seen e.g.  in galactic outflows @xcite .",
    "for the same reason as in the previous section , such motions should act such as to diminish the boost .",
    "this stands in contrast to what is expected @xcite for a more homogeneous shell of gas being expelled from the galaxy , surrounding a central source and covering the full sky . in that case , the ly@xmath0  photons that would otherwise have to scatter their way through the shell , being very vulnerable to dust absorption , may be shifted away from the line center and escape through the shell with minimal absorption .",
    "figure [ fig : wind ] shows how the ew boost depends on the expansion velocity .",
    "the wind speed is a function of distance @xmath89 from the center and is modelled assumed that the gas elements receive an acceleration @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "the speed thus increases from 0 at @xmath91 to the terminal velocity at @xmath92 .",
    "note , however , that the exact wind profile is not a major determinant of the resulting boost .",

    "[ fig : wind ] resemble those in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigv ] , although they are somewhat more shallow .",
    "the reason is that a photon bouncing off of a cloud in a galactic wind will , in general , upon its next encounter with a cloud , meet a cloud with roughly the same velocity . in the case of random motions ,",
    "the relative velocity of the next cloud may be very high , increasing the probability of the photon being absorbed .    for reasons of symmetry , in terms of @xmath38",
    "the same results are obtained if the velocities are inverted , as would be the case for galactic gas accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the spectra , however , would be reflected about the line center .",
    "thus far , we have assumed an icm completely void of both dust and neutral gas .",
    "due to the high temperature of the icm , the hydrogen is expected to be quite highly ionized .",
    "similarly , due to the high temperature , as well as the stronger ionizing uv radiation field , dust may be expected to be partly depleted .",
    "however , even a single scattering in the icm may be fatal to a ly@xmath0  photon : exactly because of the high temperature , a scattering event in the icm is likely to occur on a high - velocity atom moving more or less perpendicular to the path of the photon , such that the velocity relative to the trajectory of the photon is small .",
    "unless the photon is scattered close to ( or opposite to ) the same direction , it will be highly doppler - shifted , such that next time it encounters a cloud , it will penetrate deeply into the dusty medium , with a higher probability of being absorbed .",

    "the effect can thus be simulated by letting @xmath129@xmath130 k. note also that much of the wnm may be in a thermally unstable phase @xcite , reaching temperatures below 5000 k.      surrounding the neutral gas is the him , heated and ionized to a large degree by supernova shock waves sweeping through the ism .",

    "firstly , it must be remembered that the mere report of an enhanced ew not necessarily implies an enhanced ew . for faint continua , determining the ew is associated with considerable error , and most of proclaimed high - ews have huge error bars .",

    "the theoretical upper limit for the ly@xmath0  ew of 240  assumes a @xcite imf at solar metallicity . for decreasing metallicites ,",
    "the main sequence of a stellar population is shifted to the blue , resulting in a slower decline of the ionizing photon production , and thus a higher ly@xmath0  ew @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , even for @xmath221 , the ew of a starburst is `` only '' 350  , i.e.  corresponds to an interpreted boost of @xmath222 .    for even lower values of @xmath57 very high values of @xmath4  may be reached .",

    "* ) . while still not observationally confirmed , stars born from ( close to ) metal - free gas are expected to be able to reach very high masses .",
    "being particularly luminous in the lyman continuum , such a population of stars will be able to emit a remarkable fraction of their photons in ly@xmath0 .",
    "whereas a `` normal '' population emits 67% of its bolometric luminosity in ly@xmath0 , 1040% can be reached for sufficiently low metallicities , with a resulting @xmath4  of several thousands of ngstrm @xcite .",

    "this was investigated for a homogeneous sphere of dust - free gas by @xcite and @xcite , who found that , depending on the column densities , the ly@xmath0  radiation may be appreciably delayed .",
    "when clumpiness is introduced , we find that the escape time decreases significantly .",
    "for instance , if all the gas in the fiducial model is distributed homogeneously , the ly@xmath0  photons escape with a typical delay of @xmath234 kyr if there were no dust .",
    "in contrast , with the clumpy structure , @xmath235 kyr ( not considering the photons that escape directly without interacting with any clouds ) . when dust is added , @xmath236 is reduced further , since the photons that have the longest escape time are the ones that are most prone to absorption .    for larger",

    "solving simultanenously the rt for ly@xmath0  and ionizing uv radiaton in a spherically symmetric model galaxy , @xcite found that most of the ly@xmath0photons could remain trapped until the galaxy has been fully ionized , at which point the `` old '' and the `` new '' ly@xmath0  photons are released together , resulting in ly@xmath0  ews of up to @xmath239  .",
    "it is unclear , however , how applicable these results are to more realistically simulated galaxies , where low - density regions are ionized more rapidly , allowing the ly@xmath0  photons to leak in those directions .    in a cosmologically simulated galaxy of approximate radius 25 kpc , @xcite found a typical path length of the ly@xmath0  photons of @xmath240 kpc , i.e.  a delay with respect to the continuum of @xmath11 kyr .",

    "even type ii agns , i.e.  objects where the broad - line region is not visible , typically have larger line widths than the observed high - ew objects . furthermore , if the majority of the high - ew systems were due to agn activity , it would be inconsistent with the x - ray emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the ratio of the fluxes escaping in the most luminous to the least luminous direction , roughly corresponding to what would be interpreted as an ew boost , was in the range 1.54 if integrating over the whole galaxy , and @xmath168 if looking at the region of maximum surface brightness only . from fig .",

    "more recently , @xcite found no preferred direction of escape for a single , cosmologically simulated galaxy at @xmath247 , but a strong dependence on viewing angle at @xmath248 when the galaxy had settled into a disk , similar to what was found by @xcite for an isolated disk galaxy .      at high redshifts , a large fraction of galaxies",
    "may be expected to be in the process of forming , i.e.  to accrete gas from the surrounding medium , resulting in collisionally excited hi leading to ly@xmath0  emission .",
    "since the implied densities are rather high , the timescale for cooling is generally smaller than the dynamical timescale , and thus the infalling gas should be relatively cold ( @xmath249 k , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "consequently , roughly 50% of the energy is emitted in the ly@xmath0  line alone @xcite .",
    "for relatively massive galaxies , @xcite found at @xmath250 that cold gas accreting can give rise to significant ly@xmath0  emission of up to a few times @xmath2512  arcsec@xmath174 on scales of 10 - 100 kpc , which is comparable to typical line strengths .",
    "such gravitational cooling not only gives rise to ly@xmath0  radiation but also to a continuum , although relatively it is much fainter than the stellar continuum .",
    "@xcite calculated analytically the ew of the cooling radiation from a collapsing halo and found that , depending on where the continuum is measured , the intrinsic ew of the cooling radiation is @xmath252  .",
    "numerically , a few studies have addressed this issue and find that in general the fraction of the ly@xmath0  radiation that stems from gravitational cooling increases with @xmath7 , from @xmath168% at @xmath253 @xcite , to @xmath254 - 18% at @xmath2556.5 @xcite , to @xmath256 - 60% at @xmath2578 @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite found that cooling radiation becomes comparable to recombination ly@xmath0  for @xmath258 .",
    "obviously , large deviations from these values exist , both numerically and in reality , as in the case of ly@xmath0  blobs where in some cases no stellar continuum is seen at all ; a liable explanation for these objects is cold accretion @xcite    however , while the photons of stellar origin , both ly@xmath0  and continuum , tend to be born in regions of comparatively high densities of both dust and neutral gas , thus being more prone to dust absorption , the cooling photons may escape more or less freely .",
    "thus , cooling radiation could dominate even at quite low redshifts , although the actual fraction is difficult to assess observationally as long as the escape fraction of stellarly produced photons is still associated with so large uncertainties .      at high redshifts , neutral hydrogen in the igm scatter a significant fraction of the photons blueward of the ly@xmath0  line out of the line of sight .",
    "this affects both the continuum and the line itself , and is sometimes accounted for using a model of the igm absorption .",
    "for instance , @xcite use the prescription of @xcite and found that the corrections for the broadband and the narrowband approximately cancel , leaving the ew unaffected .",
    "this assumes that the ly@xmath0  line is symmetric about the line center ; if the red peak is enhanced relative to the blue peak , as would be the case for an expanding medium , the igm transmits more ly@xmath0 , resulting in the erroneous interpretation that the ew is larger than in reality .",
    "moreover , as the galaxies detected in ly@xmath0  at high redshifts may be biased toward being the ones that have made themselves visible by ionizing a bubble around them in an otherwise partly neutral igm , the line may be less affected by the igm than the continuum , which again would be interpreted as an ew boost .    even if the correlation of the state of the igm with the sources is taken into account , large fluctuations in the neutral fraction of hydrogen exists , which may also be a possible source of error ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "using a simple model for laes at high redshifts but incorporating clumpiness of the igm , @xcite calculate distribution functions for observed ews , for various narrowband / broadband techniques .",
    "they found that , depending on the redshift , the median @xmath6  may easily lie appreciatively above @xmath5 , and that for instance at @xmath259 with narrowband and broadband both centered on the ly@xmath0  line , 20% of the ews will be boosted by a factor of 2 or higher .      when calculating the resulting ew from a distribution of stellar masses , an infinite number of stars are usually assumed . using the numerical code slug @xcite",
    ", @xcite found that for low - sfrs galaxies , stochasticity alone results in a distribution of ews from @xmath260 to @xmath261 , where @xmath262 is the mean ew .",
    "however , since this effect is minimal for sfrs @xmath263  yr@xmath166 , which are hardly visible at high redshifts , it can not serve as an explanation for most of the observed high - ew galaxies .      for resolved galaxies , regions with no star formation may scatter ly@xmath0  from distant regions toward the observer , such that these particular regions exhibit extreme ews @xcite .",
    "integrated over the source , however , ly@xmath0-overluminous regions cancel out with underluminous regions ( modulo other effects affecting the rt ) .",
    "we have carried out a comprehensive set of ly@xmath0  and fuv continuum radiative transfer calculations , systematically varying the significant physical parameters , first separately and then in unison .",
    "the aim was to investigate whether a multiphase interstellar medium is capable of preferentially absorbing the continuum so as to enhance the observed ly@xmath0  equivalent width .",
    "the motivation for this study are the numerous observations of ly@xmath0  emitting galaxies exhibiting ews larger than what is theoretically expected , together with the previously proposed explanation of such a `` boost '' being a consequence of a clumpy ism @xcite . in the suggested model ,",
    "a galaxy consists of a number of clouds , physically corresponding to the ism phase termed the `` warm neutral medium '' , dispersed in a low - density medium corresponding to the phase called the `` hot ionized medium '' .",
    "we find that , while indeed it is possible to construct a model galaxy with the said ability , the physical properties needed are extremely unlikely to be found in a real galaxy . in order for a galaxy to enhance its intrinsic ly@xmath0  ew ,",
    "a large number of criteria must be met :    1 .   the metallicity must be high ( @xmath264 solar ) , 2 .",
    "the density of the wnm must be very high ( @xmath265 times typical values ) , 3 .",
    "the density of the him _ and _ its ionization fraction must be very low , so that the total density of neutral hydrogen in this phase does not exceed @xmath266 , 4 .",
    "the bulk ( @xmath26790% ) of the ly@xmath0  and fuv photons must originate from regions where the stars have blown away the neutral gas from which they were born , 5 .",
    "the galaxy must have virtually no outflows ( @xmath268 @xmath84 ) , and 6 .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the gas clouds must be very low ( @xmath269 @xmath84 ) .",
    "in particular the latter two points are important ; the whole point of the proposed multiphase model is that the paths of the ly@xmath0  photons are confined to a dust- and gasless medium , never penetrating the dusty clouds but instead scattering off of their surfaces .",
    "this mechanism works because of the resonance nature of ly@xmath0  scattering . however , as soon as the clouds have a small velocity , especially random motions , the ly@xmath0  photons are shifted out of resonance in the reference frame of the clouds , allowing them to penetrate much farther into the clouds and thus exposing them to a higher column density of dust .",
    "note that in principle it _ is _ possible to have an enhanced ew for larger velocity fields , but this will require even more extreme conditions regarding the other parameters . with regards to the required densities of neutral hydrogen , these are more characteristic of the so - called cold neutral medium or molecular clouds .",
    "since the volume occupied by these phases are much smaller than that of the wnm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the covering factor of these phases is small .",
    "moreover , they will typically be embedded _ inside _ the wnm , affecting only those photons that were already trapped in the clouds .",
    "in addition to the points mentioned above , it must also be remembered that the _ intrinsic _",
    "ly@xmath0  ew of a galaxy exhibiting a high observed ew must be high , i.e.  the stellar population must be very young ( @xmath270a few myr ) ; otherwise an even higher boost would be needed to bring the ew above the theoretical limit .    in conclusion ,",
    "we consider the neufeld model to be an extremely unlikely reason for the observed high ews .",
    "we have discussed a number of other possible explanation ( sec .",
    "[ sec : alt ] ) , of which the most probable , in our opinion , is excess of ly@xmath0  radiation from cold accretion ( may contribute @xmath2711 times the stellar ly@xmath0 , depending on redshift , but may escape much more easily ) , and/or anisotropic escape of ly@xmath0  ( the ly@xmath0  flux may vary in different directions by a factor @xmath12810 , depending on irregularity of the galaxy and aperture of the detector .",

    "the simulations were performed on the facilities provided by the danish center for scientific computing .",
    "the original version of mocalata  included only the rt of ly@xmath0 , i.e.  the initial frequency probability distribution of photons followed a voigt profile with the gaussian core given by the temperature / turbulence of the gas . to calculate ews ,",
    "the wavelength range @xmath272 transferred though the medium must be extended so as to include the continuum .",
    "for a given ew this is readily accomplished by first determining whether an emitted photon is a line rather than a continuum photon , with a probability @xmath273 , and then determining the exact wavelength of the photon depending on the intrinsic line profile or the slope of the continuum ( in this study taken to be flat in @xmath274 ) . for a broad wavelength region around ly@xmath0 , numerically there is no difference in the rt of the two kinds of photons .      in order to construct spherical clouds , we make use of adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) , where cells may be refined into eight subcells . as the clouds themselves are uniform , high resolution is only needed at their surfaces , not their interior . to build the amr grid",
    ", we use the following approach :    given a number @xmath20 of clouds and a distribution of sizes specified by a minimum and maximum radius @xmath275 and @xmath276 , as well as a size distribution power law index @xmath77 , cloud centers are placed randomly in a sphere of radius @xmath22 , such that no clouds overlap .",
    "the clouds surfaces are then marked by a number of auxiliary particles , typically @xmath144 .",
    "subsequently , the grid is constructed starting from a mother grid of base resolution @xmath277 , recursively refining any cell that contains more than one particle .",
    "finally , each cell is labeled either a `` cloud '' cell or an `` icm '' cell , depending on the distance to the nearest cloud center , and the physical parameters then assigned accordingly .",
    "note that all cells belonging to a given cloud share the same bulk velocity , such that there are no velocity gradients inside a cloud .",
    "the auxiliary particles can be positioned in different ways so as to constitute the cloud surface ; the most straightforward way is to place them at a random position at a distance @xmath21  from the center of the cloud .",
    "however , it turns out that in general some particles end up so close to each other , that in order to refine the cells sufficiently , hundreds of refinement levels may needed .",

    "various algorithms exist for this geometrical exercise ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      to speed up calculations , mocalata  makes use of various acceleration schemes .",
    "the most efficient is the _ core - skipping _ scheme : since scatterings of photons near the line center are usually associated with negligible spatial movement , while it typically takes of the order @xmath278 scatterings to `` escape '' the core , these scatterings can be skipped by drawing the random velocity of the scattering atom from a centrally - truncated gaussian , favoring fast moving atoms that can give the photon a large doppler shift . in mocalata ,",
    "the critical wavelength defining when the acceleration scheme can be invoked is dependent on the product @xmath279 , such that for higher  column densities and lower temperatures , a larger critical value can be used , allowing for a larger speed - up .",
    "the value of @xmath279 is specific to a given cell , and is calculated from the center of the cell to the face .",
    "since the code has previously been used for galaxies extracted from cosmological simulations , cells are usually surrounded by other cells of similar physical conditions , i.e.  there are no large gradients . in the present , idealized simulations , however , where densities may go from zero to some extreme value over the course of a single cell step , this poses a problem for photons close to the line center scattering on the surface of a cloud .    in reality",
    ", the photon typically escapes after a handful of scatterings , changing its frequency only of the order 1.5 doppler widths . with the acceleration scheme ,",
    "the first scattering pushes the photon artificially far out in the wing , rendering the optical depth of hydrogen significantly reduced , such that the photon is able to penetrate the cloud ( or the next cloud ) too much , with a corresponding higher probability of being absorbed by dust .",

    "<S> it has been suggested that radiative transfer effects may explain the unusually high equivalent widths ( ews ) of the ly@xmath0  line , observed occasionally from starburst galaxies , especially at high redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> if the dust is locked up inside high - density clouds dispersed in an empty intercloud medium , the ly@xmath0  photons could scatter off of the surfaces of the clouds , effectively having their journey confined to the dustless medium . the continuum radiation , on the other hand , does not scatter , and would thus be subject to absorption inside the clouds .    </S>",
    "<S> this scenario is routinely invoked when ly@xmath0  ews higher than what is expected theoretically are observed , although the ideal conditions under which the results are derived usually are not considered . </S>",
    "<S> here we systematically examine the relevant physical parameters in this idealized framework , testing whether any astrophysically realistic scenarios may lead to such an effect . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that although clumpiness indeed facilitates the escape of ly@xmath0 , it is highly unlikely that any real interstellar media should result in a preferential escape of ly@xmath0  over continuum radiation . </S>",
    "<S> other possible causes are discussed , and it is concluded that the observed high ews are more likely to be caused by cooling radiation from cold accretion and/or anisotropic escape of the ly@xmath0  radiation .    </S>",
