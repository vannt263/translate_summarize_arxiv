    "our understanding of how galaxies form and evolve has changed in a rather unexpected way in recent years . on the one hand",
    ", massive black - holes now appear to populate the nuclei of virtually every ( massive enough ) galaxy . on the other ,",
    "the nuclei of active galaxies ( agn ) , previously thought to be the only galaxies that harbored massive black - holes , are now known to be the hosts of massive star - forming regions .",
    "hence , black - holes and starburst clusters coexist and are ubiquitous in the nuclear regions of galaxies .",
    "the observational evidence for this scenario is abundant .",
    "the presence of strong caii triplet absorptions in a large sample of seyfert  2s and some seyfert  1s provided the first direct evidence for a population of red super - giant stars in their nuclear regions ( terlevich , daz & terlevich 1990 ) .",
    "the absence of signs of a broad line region ( blr ) in the direct optical spectra of seyfert  2 nuclei which show broad lines in polarized light can only be understood if there is an additional central source of blue / uv continuum associated with the obscuring torus ( cid fernandes & terlevich 1995 ) .",
    "this conclusion is further supported by observations that polarization is lower in the continuum than in the scattered broad lines ( miller & goodrich , 1990 ; tran 1995a , b )    most of the uv to near - ir continuum light in a number of seyfert  2s , in particular all those so far observed with hst , is due to nuclear starbursts that are resolved in hst images . in some of these galaxies ,",
    "the starburst luminosities are comparable to those of their ionizing engines .",
    "thus , an observer situated along the axis of the torus will detect comparable contributions to the optical continuum coming from the starburst and from the broad line region components ( heckman 1995 , 1997 ) .",
    "massive star forming regions are even found in the nuclei of powerful radio galaxies through the detection of balmer absorption lines or strong caii triplet lines ( melnick 1997 ; aretxaga 2001 ; wills 2002 ) , showing that the intimate link between nuclear activity and star - formation exists not only in spiral galaxies , but also in massive ellipticals .    we have been engaged in a large spectroscopic survey of the nearest seyfert galaxies in the southern hemisphere aimed at characterizing the properties of nuclear star - forming regions as a first step to understand the link between nuclear starbursts and massive black holes .",
    "the first results of this project were reported in joguet ( 2001 , hereafter j01 ) , where high s / n observations of about 80 seyfert  2 galaxies were presented .",
    "this first inspection of the data revealed that about 50% of seyfert 2s exihibit",
    "clear spectral signatures of star - formation in the recent past ( @xmath2 myr ) , most notably high - order balmer lines in absorption .",
    "the other half of the sample is equally split between nuclei with strong emission lines but weak absorption lines and nuclei with a rich absorption line spectrum and reddish continuum , characteristic of old stellar populations .",
    "these results are in line with those obtained with smaller samples ( schmitt , storchi - bergmann & cid fernandes 1999 ; gonzlez - delgado , heckman & leitherer 2001 ; cid fernandes 2001a , hereafter cf01 ) , and highlight the high frequency of star - formation in seyfert 2s .",
    "recently we have also started to detect high order balmer lines in seyfert 1s which may indicate the presence of extremely compact and luminous starbursts .",
    "the fraction of seyfert  1 nuclei with balmer absorption is understandingly lower than in seyfert 2s given the additional difficulty of disentangling the stellar absorption features from the broad emission lines in seyfert 1s ( torres - papaqui 2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "this paper is the first of a series devoted to a quantitative analysis of the stellar populations in the nuclei of nearby seyfert galaxies .",
    "we present detailed population synthesis models for a sample of 79 galaxies studied by j01 . for each galaxy",
    "we derive the nuclear star - formation history ( sfh ) , and correlate the nuclear stellar populations with other properties such as the emission line spectra and the ( central ) morphology of the parent galaxy .",
    "the models are also used to produce continuum - subtracted `` pure emission line '' spectra which will be used in subsequent papers to study other properties of the nuclei including emission - line profiles , the relation between stellar and nebular kinematics , etc .",
    "the ultimate aim of this study is to have at least a first glimpse at the coveted evolutionary connection between monsters and starbursts .",
    "this first paper concentrates on the presentation of our synthesis method and the results of its application to the j01 sample .",
    "section [ sec : data ] reviews the data set used in this study .",
    "a spectral synthesis method which combines tools from empirical population synthesis with the new bruzual & charlot ( 2003 , hereafter bc03 ) models is described in section [ sec : specsynthesis ] and its application to 65 seyfert 2s and 14 other galaxies is presented in section [ sec : j01synthesis ] .",
    "the model subtracted spectra are used to search for weak broad emission features in section [ sec : starlight_subtracted_spectra ] .",
    "section [ sec : indices ] presents an empirical characterization of the stellar populations in the sample based on a set of spectral indices .",
    "the statistics of star - formation in seyfert 2s and relations to host morphology are discussed in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "highly efficient blue spectroscopic observations of nearby seyfert 2 galaxies were carried out in four observing runs between may 1998 and august 2000 , with the 1.5 m eso telescope at la silla ( chile ) . the spectra cover a wavelength range from 3470 to 5450  , with a spatial sampling of @xmath3 per pixel .",
    "a detailed description of the acquisition and reduction of the data , as well as of the selection of the sample has been published in j01 .    for this work , 1d spectra",
    "have been extracted afresh restricting ourselves to the central pixel , which , at the redshifts of the galaxy sample and adopting @xmath4 km@xmath5s@xmath6mpc@xmath6 , represents the central 59 to 439 pc for the seyfert 2 galaxies ( median = 174 pc ) , and 45 to 596 pc for the seyfert 1 , liner , starburst and normal ones ( median = 121 pc ) .",
    "table [ tab : sample ] lists some properties of the galaxies in the sample , including morphology , far - infrared properties and the linear scale .",
    "j01 listed 15 galaxies of the sample with dubious ( or wrong ) seyfert 2 classification .",
    "after inspection of the spectra and a revision of literature data , six extra objects were reclassified .",
    "ngc 1097 ( storchi - bergmann 2003 ) , ngc 4303 ( colina 2003 ; jimnez - bailn 2003 ) and ngc 4602 were classified as liners .",
    "ngc 2935 and the mergers ngc 1487 and ngc 3256 were reclassified as starbursts ( dessauges - zavadsky 2000 ; lira 2002 ) .",
    "after these minor revisions , the final sample has 65 seyfert 2s , 1 seyfert 1 , 4 liners , 4 starburst / hii nuclei and 5 normal galaxies .",
    "note that our list of seyfert 2s includes some mixed cases , such as ngc 6221 ( levenson 2001 ) , ngc 7496 ( j01 ) and 7679 ( gu 2001 ; della ceca 2001 ) . except for subtle details like high - excitation components in the wings of the [ oiii ] and h@xmath1 profiles ,",
    "these nuclei look like starbursts in the optical but have x - ray properties of agn ( see also maiolino 2003 ; gonalves , vron - cetty & vron 1999 ) .",

    "the modeling of stellar populations in galaxies has recently undergone a major improvement with the publication of high spectral resolution evolutionary synthesis models by bc03 .",

    "* @xmath21 is the reddening term , with @xmath22 as the extinction at wavelength @xmath23 .",
    "extinction is modeled as due to an uniform dust screen , parametrized by the v - band extinction @xmath24 .",

    "these flux fractions can be converted to a mass fractions vector @xmath29 using the model light - to - mass ratios at @xmath19 .",

    "we normalize @xmath14 by its median value ( @xmath37 ) in a window containing @xmath19 instead of normalizing it by @xmath38 , which is obviously more sensitive to noise than the median flux .",
    "the synthetic spectrum is thus modeled in units of @xmath37 , and we expect to obtain @xmath39 in these units .    the search for the best parameters is carried out with a simulated annealing method , which consists of a series of @xmath40 likelihood - guided metropolis tours through the parameter space ( see cid fernandes 2001b for an illustrated discussion of the metropolis method applied to the population synthesis problem ) . in each iteration , the weights @xmath35 are increased by a factor @xmath41 , thus narrowing the peaks in the @xmath42 hyper - surface . the step - size ( @xmath43 ) in each parameter is concomitantly decreased and the number of steps ( @xmath44 ) is increased to insure that each parameter can in principle random - walk through all its allowed range of values ( eg , @xmath45 for the @xmath26 components ) . to speed up computations , the kinematical parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33",

    ", extinction laws and other details has been used in several recent investigations ( eg , kauffmann 2003 ; tremonti 2003 ; mayya 2004 ; bc03 ) .      [ sec : groupingschemes ]    a key ingredient in the synthesis of stellar populations is the spectral base @xmath49 .",
    "ideally , the elements of the base should span the range of spectral properties observed in the sample galaxies and provide enough resolution in age and metallicity to address the desired scientific questions .",
    "we used as a starting base the 30 ssps used by tremonti ( 2003 ) in her study of sdss galaxies .",
    "these ssps cover 10 ages , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 yr , and 3 metallicities , @xmath60 , 1 and @xmath61 .",
    "tremonti also included 9 other spectra in her base , corresponding to continuous star formation models of different ages , e - folding times and metallicities .",
    "not surprisingly , we found that these spectra are very well modeled by combinations of the ssps in the base .",
    "their inclusion in the base therefore introduces unnecessary redundancies , so we opted not to include these components .",
    "smaller bases , with these same ages but only one or two metallicities , were also explored .",
    "extensive simulations were performed to evaluate the code s ability to recover input parameters , to calibrate its technical parameters ( number of steps , step - size , etc . ) and to investigate the effects of noise in the data . to emulate the modeling of real galaxy spectra discussed in  [ sec : j01synthesis ] , the simulations were restricted to the 35005200   interval , with masks around the wavelengths of strong emission lines .",
    "tests with fake galaxies generated out of the base show that in the absence of noise the code is able to recover the input parameters to a high degree of accuracy .",
    "this is illustrated in figures [ fig : input_x_ouput]a  c , where we plot input against output @xmath27 fractions for 3 selected ages and all 3 metallicities .",
    "the rms difference between input and output @xmath27 in these simulations is typically @xmath62 .",
    "this good agreement goes away when noise is added to the spectra . as found in other population synthesis methods ( eg . , mayya 2004 )",
    ", noise has the effect of inducing substantial rearrangements among @xmath26 components corresponding to spectrally similar populations .",
    "the reason for this is that noise washes away the differences between @xmath49 spectra which are similar due to intrinsic degeneracies of stellar populations ( like the age - metallicity degeneracy ; worthey 1994 ) .",
    "the net effect is that , for practical purposes , the base becomes linearly dependent , such that a given component is well reproduced by linear combinations of others , as extensively discussed by cid fernandes ( 2001b ) .",
    "for realistic @xmath63 ratios these rearrangements have disastrous effects upon the individual @xmath27 fractions , as illustrated in figures [ fig : input_x_ouput]d  f .",
    "the test galaxies in these plots are the same ones used in the noise - free simulations ( panels a ",
    "c ) , but with gaussian noise of amplitude @xmath64 added to their spectra .",
    "each galaxy was modeled 50 times for different realizations of the noise , and we plot the mean output @xmath27 with an error bar to indicate the rms dispersion among these set of perturbed spectra .",
    "clearly , the individual @xmath27 fractions are not well recovered at all .",
    "hence , while in principle it is desirable to use a large , fine graded base , the resulting sfh expressed in @xmath26 can not be trusted to the same level of detail .    a strategy to circumvent this problem is to _ group _ the @xmath27 fractions corresponding to spectrally similar components , which yields much more reliable results at the expense of a coarser description of the stellar population mixture .",
    "this reduction can be done in a number of ways ( pelat 1997 ; moultaka & pelat 2000 ; chan , mitchell , & cram 2003 ) . here",
    "we use our simulations to define combinations of @xmath26 components which are relatively immune to degeneracy effects .",
    "we define a reduced population vector with three age ranges : @xmath65 myr ; 100 myr @xmath66 gyr and @xmath67 gyr .",
    "the resulting population vector is denoted by ( @xmath68 ) , where @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 correspond to young , intermediate and old respectively .",
    "note that the metallicity information is binned - over in this description .",
    "figures [ fig : input_x_ouput]g  i show the input against output ( @xmath68 ) components for the same @xmath72 simulations described above .",
    "the deviations observed in the individual @xmath27 fractions are negligible in this condensed description .",
    "finally , we note that extinction does not suffer from the degeneracies which plague the population vector .",
    "for @xmath64 the output @xmath24 matches the input value to within 0.04 mag rms .",
    "the synthesis method described above was applied to the spectra presented in  [ sec : data ] in order to estimate the star formation history in the central regions of seyfert 2s .      for the application described in this paper we have used the following set - up : @xmath73 metropolis loops , with weights increasing geometrically from @xmath74 to 10 times their nominal values while the step sizes decrease from @xmath75 to 0.005 for both the @xmath26 components , @xmath30 and @xmath24 .",
    "the number of steps in each metropolis run is computed as a function of the number of parameters being changed and by the step - size : @xmath76 .",
    "since we are modeling galactic nuclei , it is reasonable to neglect the contribution of metal poor populations .",
    "we thus opted to use a base of @xmath77 components with the same 10 ages described above but reduced to @xmath78 and @xmath61 .",
    "this setup gives a total of @xmath79 steps in the search for a best model .",
    "prior to the synthesis all spectra were corrected for galactic extinction using the law of cardelli ( 1989 ) and the @xmath80 values from schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) as listed in ned .",
    "the spectra were also re - binned to 1   sampling and shifted to the rest - frame .",
    "the fitted values of @xmath32 should therefore be close to zero .",
    "we chose to normalize the base at @xmath81  , while the observed spectra are normalized to the median flux between 4010 and 4060  .",
    "this facilitates comparison with previous studies which used a similar normalization ( eg . ,",
    "gonzlez delgado 2004 ) . a flat error spectrum is assumed .",

    "masks of 2030   around obvious emission lines were constructed for each object individually . in sources like ngc 3256 and eso 323-g32 , these @xmath36 masks remove relatively small portions of the original spectra . in several cases , however , the emission line spectrum is so rich that the unmasked spectrum contains relatively few stellar features apart from the continuum shape ( eg , mrk 1210 , ngc 4507 ) . it some cases it was also necessary to mask the @xmath83   region because of strong nebular emission in the balmer continuum ( eg , ngc 7212 ) .",
    "the strongest stellar features which are less affected by emission are ca ii k and the g - band .",
    "we have increased the weight of these two features by multiplying @xmath35 by 2 in windows of @xmath84   around their central wavelengths , although this is of little consequence for the results reported in this paper .",
    "a non - stellar component , represented by a @xmath85 power - law , was added to the stellar base to represent the contribution of an agn featureless continuum , a traditional ingredient in the spectral modeling of seyfert galaxies since koski ( 1978 ) . the fractional contribution of this component to the flux at @xmath19",
    "is denoted by @xmath86 .    in the framework of the unified model",
    "( eg , antonucci 1993 ) , in seyfert 2s this fc , if present , must be scattered radiation from the hidden seyfert 1 nucleus .",

    "also , the stellar population base used by cf01 is that of schmidt ( 1991 ) , built upon integrated spectra of star clusters whose age and metallicity were determined by bica & alloin ( 1986 ) , whereas here we use the bc03 models . notwithstanding the different methodologies , as well as differences in the spectra themselves ( eg , due to the larger apertures in cf01 )",
    ", one expects to find a reasonable agreement between these two studies .",
    "figure [ fig : x_us_x_cf01 ] summarizes the results of this comparison .",
    "stars are used to plot the @xmath115 fraction of cf01 ( called just `` @xmath86 '' in that paper ) against our estimate , after re - scaling it to @xmath116   to match the normalization in cf01 .",
    "the agreement is very good , with a mean offset of 4% and rms of 6% between the two studies .",
    "crosses and circles are used for the @xmath117 and @xmath118 components of cf01 , which represent @xmath119 myr and @xmath120 gyr age bins . while qualitatively similar , these two components do not compare well with our definitions of @xmath88 and @xmath89 , which are systematically larger and smaller than @xmath117 and @xmath118 respectively .",
    "this is essentially due to the different age - grouping schemes employed .",
    "binning our 100 and 290 myr base components into @xmath121 and all @xmath122 myr components into @xmath123 yields a good correspondence with the @xmath117 and @xmath118 of cf01 , with residuals similar to those obtained for @xmath115 , as shown in figure [ fig : x_us_x_cf01 ] .",
    "the two discrepant crosses in the bottom of figure [ fig : x_us_x_cf01 ] are ic 5135 (= ngc 7130 ) and ngc 5135 .",
    "again , the disagreement is only apparent .",
    "our spectral synthesis find null contributions of the 100 and 290 myr components , but for ngc 5135 it fits 27% of the continuum at 4861   as due to the 640 myr component , while for ic 5135 18 and 21% are associated with 640 and 900 myr - old bursts respectively . in our discrete base these components are adjacent in age to the 290 myr one used as the upper limit for @xmath121 in the plot , and hence could well be regrouped within an intermediate age component by a slight modification of the age range associated with @xmath121 , removing the discrepancy . in short , these ambiguities arise primarily because of the different age resolutions employed in the two studies .",
    "finally , we note that our results for these two galaxies compare well with those of gonzlez delgado ( 2001 ) , who performed a detailed spectral fit of the balmer absorption lines characteristic of intermediate age populations using their own models ( gonzlez delgado , leitherer & heckman 1999 ) . for both ic 5135 and ngc 5135",
    "they find @xmath124 , 40 and 10% contributions ( at 4800  ) of young , intermediate age and old populations respectively , where the intermediate age component is modeled as a combination of 200 , 500 and 1000 myr bursts .",
    "our condensed population vector ( at 4861  ) for these galaxies are @xmath125 ( 60,40,0 ) and ( 56,27,17 ) respectively .",
    "we thus conclude that the population synthesis results reported here are consistent to within @xmath126 with previous results , which is quite remarkable given differences in data and analysis methods .",
    "a clear advantage of our approach with respect to methods like those in cf01 is that we model the full spectrum , which , besides providing more constraints , yields a more detailed understanding of the different components which make up a seyfert 2 spectrum .",
    "this advantage is explored next .",
    "the excellent fits of the starlight in our spectra provide a unique opportunity to investigate the presence of weak emission features in the @xmath48 residual spectra . in this section",
    "we explore this opportunity and examine the consequences for the interpretation of the synthesis results .",
    "the presence of wr starts , which produce the so called wr bump at @xmath127  , provides a clear indication of starburst activity which is complementary to the population synthesis .",
    "we have used the starlight subtracted spectra to investigate the presence of the wr bump in our sample galaxies .",
    "wr stars were detected in the starburst / wr galaxy eso108-g17 and in the seyfert 2s mcg-03 - 34 , mrk 1210 and ngc 424 .",
    "hints of a wr bump are also present in eso 138-g01 and ngc 4507 , but these cases require confirmation either from deeper observations or detection of the 5812   feature ( schaerer , contini & kunth 1999 ) .",
    "these results are presented as notes in table  [ tab : synthesis ] , which summarizes the results of the spectral synthesis models .",
    "galaxies that show wr signatures present important young stellar components ( average @xmath87 of 30% ) , thus validating the results of the synthesis . given the severe blending with nebular lines of heii , ariv , neiv and feiii in seyfert 2s , it is probably futile to attempt any detailed modeling of the wr population .      a close inspection of the starlight subtracted spectra reveals a weak broad h@xmath1 in several of our seyfert 2s .",
    "this is the case of ngc 3035 , classified as a seyfert 1 in ned but reclassified as a seyfert 2 by j01 on the basis of the absence of broad lines . the top spectrum in figure [ fig : ngc3035_and_ngc3660]a is the same one used by j01 .",
    "when we subtract our starlight model , however , a weak but clear broad component emerges in h@xmath1 ( bottom spectrum in figure [ fig : ngc3035_and_ngc3660]a ) .",
    "component not evident in the total spectrum .",
    "the dashed line marks the zero flux level for the bottom spectrum .",
    "( b ) as the top panel , but for ngc 3660.,width=680 ]    at least seven other objects exhibit a similar weak broad component under h@xmath1 : eso 383-g18 , mcg-03 - 34 - 064 , ngc 424 , ngc 1068 , ngc 3660 ( figure [ fig : ngc3035_and_ngc3660]b ) , ngc 5506 and ngc 7212 , and 2 other objects present marginal evidence for a broad h@xmath1 . in principle",
    ", these nuclei could be reclassified as seyfert 1.5 or 1.8 , following the notation of osterbrock ( 1984 ) .",
    "however , the detection of weak broad lines is not _",
    "per se _ reason enough to classify a nucleus as of type 1 .",
    "this violation of the historical definition of seyfert types by kachikian & weedman ( 1974 ) is allowed in the context of the unified model , which predicts that a weak blr should be detected in seyfert 2s ( at least those with a scattering region ) .",
    "we have thus opted not to reclassify these objects , with the understanding that these weak features are probably scattered lines .",
    "the detection of a blr provides a useful constraint for the interpretation of the spectral synthesis results .",
    "broad emission lines in agn always come with an associated non - stellar fc , presumably from the nuclear accretion disk .",
    "this is true regardless of whether the nucleus and blr are seen directly , as in _ bona fide _",
    "seyfert 1s , or via scattering , as in ngc 1068 , the prototypical seyfert 2 ( antonucci & miller 1985 ) .",
    "hence , when the blr is detected we can be sure that an fc component is also present .",
    "column 13 of table [ tab : synthesis ] lists the spectropolarimetry information available for galaxies in our sample ( from the compilation by gu & huang 2002 plus new data from lumsden , alexander & hough 2004 ) .",
    "the existence of an agn fc can also be established _ a priori _ in seyfert 2s where spectropolarimetry reveals a type 1 spectrum , ie , those with a `` hidden blr '' .",
    "this is the case of 17 objects in our sample . in 7 of these",
    "we were able to identify a weak broad h@xmath1 in our direct spectra , while in the remaining cases the blr detected with the aid of polarimetry is just too faint to be discerned in our data . in these cases ,",
    "we expect a correspondingly weak fc component .",
    "spectropolarimetry data are available for other fourteen galaxies in our list , but no hidden seyfert 1 was detected , either because of the absence of an effective mirror or observational limitations .",
    "a further alternative is that these are `` genuine seyfert 2s '' , ie , agn with no blr ( tran 2001 , but see lumsden 2004 ) .",
    "intriguingly , tran ( 2001 ) reports no blr detection from his spectropolarimetry data on ngc 3660 , while figure [ fig : ngc3035_and_ngc3660]b leaves no doubt as to the existence of this component in direct light . variability could be the cause for this discrepancy , in which case this galaxy should be classified as a type 1 seyfert , because the blr is seen directly .",
    "a type transition of this sort has happened in ngc 7582 ( aretxaga 1999 ) , which suddenly changed spectrum from that of a seyfert 2 to one with broad emission lines sometime in mid 1998 .",
    "table [ tab : synthesis ] lists the galaxies for which we have evidence for the presence of weak broad emission lines , either from spectropolarimetry data in the literature ( hblr ) or from the present study ( blr ) .",
    "there is a clear tendency for these `` broad line seyfert 2s '' ( bls2s ) to also show an important fc component in the synthetic spectra .",
    "we thus conclude that the synthesis is able to identify a _",
    "bona fide _ non - stellar continuum when one is present .",
    "further confirmation of this fact comes from the synthesis of the seyfert 1 nucleus mrk 883 , which yields @xmath128 .",
    "as shown in paper ii ( gu , in preparation ) , there is also a tendency for bls2s to have larger [ oiii ] luminosities .",
    "this is consistent with them having more powerful agn , which , for a fixed scattering efficiency , implies a brighter , easier to detect scattered fc , in agreement with the results reported above .",
    "the synthesis also reveals a strong fc component in several objects for which there is no evidence of a blr .",
    "the question then arises of whether @xmath86 corresponds truly to an agn continuum or to a dusty starburst .",
    "it is hard to distinguish a @xmath85 power - law from the spectrum of a reddened young starburst over the wavelength range spanned by our data .",
    "the main differences between the spectrum of a 5 myr ssp seen through @xmath1293 mag of dust and this power - law lie in the balmer absorption lines and in the blue side of the balmer jump .",
    "since these features are masked in the synthesis , the @xmath86 strength can be attributed to either a dusty - starburst , a true agn fc , or to a combination of these .",
    "this confusion is likely to occur in our synthesis models given that we impose a common @xmath24 for all base components while young starbursts are intrinsically rather dusty ( selman 1999 ) .    to illustrate this issue",
    ", we note that we obtain @xmath130 for the wr galaxy eso 108-g17 ( fig [ fig : fit_j003 ] ) .",
    "given that there is no indication of an agn in this irregular galaxy , it is very likely that this fc component is actually associated with a dusty starburst .",
    "the same applies to the starbursting merger ngc 3256 , for which we derive @xmath131 .",
    "note , however , that in both cases the synthesis identifies a dominant young population , with @xmath132 and 45% respectively .",
    "not surprisingly , the starburst - fc degeneracy is more pronounced in galaxies known to harbour an active nucleus . for ngc 6221 , for instance , we find @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 , while from the detailed imaging analysis and modeling of the full spectral energy distribution carried out by levenson ( 2001 ) we know that this nucleus is dominated by heavily extincted ( @xmath136 ) young star clusters within @xmath137 of the agn , with just a few percent of the optical light originating in the agn responsible for its seyfert - like x - ray properties . most of the large @xmath86 obtained by the synthesis is thus associated with this reddened starburst .",
    "another emblematic example is ic 5135 ( ngc 7130 ) , whose uv spectrum shows wind lines of massive stars and a logarithmic slope typical of dusty starbursts , with little or no sign of a power - law ( gonzlez delgado 1998 ) , while our synthesis yields @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "similar comments can be made about other galaxies in the sample ( eg , ngc 5135 and ngc 7582 ) .",
    "these examples show that dusty starbursts , when present , are detected as an fc component by our synthesis method .",
    "the fraction @xmath86 should thus be regarded as an _ upper limit _ to the contribution of a true fc , while the light fraction associated with very recent star - formation is bracketed between @xmath87 and @xmath115 . while there is no way to break this spectral degeneracy without broader spectral coverage , the information on the presence of weak broad lines , collected in table [ tab : synthesis ] , helps tackling this issue . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : data_broadlines ] , whenever a blr component is detected either in direct or polarized light we can be sure that a true fc is present .",
    "one thus expects bls2s to have larger @xmath86 values than seyfert 2s for which we have no such independent evidence for the presence of an agn continuum .",
    "this expectation is confirmed by the synthesis .",
    "the four largest values of @xmath86 among seyfert 2s , for instance , are all found in systems which show weak broad h@xmath1 .",
    "the link between large @xmath86 and the presence of broad lines is illustrated in figure [ fig : xfc_histogram ] , which shows that the fraction of bls2s increases systematically with increasing @xmath86 .",
    "this effect is also clear in the statistics of @xmath86 , which assumes a median ( mean ) value of 21% ( 19% ) among bls2s but just 2% ( 7% ) among the rest of the seyfert 2s . as predicted in ",
    "[ sec : data_broadlines ] , selecting only the galaxies where we see the blr in our direct spectra increases the median ( mean ) @xmath86 to 31% ( 29% ) , while the ten nuclei where a hidden blr appears in polarized spectra but not in our data have weaker fcs : 5% ( 8% ) .",
    "overall , these results confirm the prediction of cid fernandes & terlevich ( 1995 ) , who estimated that a broad component in h@xmath1 should become discernible whenever the scattered fc contributes with @xmath141% of the optical continuum .",
    "whenever @xmath86 exceeds @xmath142 but no blr is seen , this component most likely originates in a dusty starburst rather than in a non - stellar source .",
    ", as shown by the dashed line and right - hand scale.,width=340 ]",
    "in order to facilitate the comparison of some relevant aspects of our population synthesis models and published work , we have found it convenient to express our results in terms of specific indices ( lines and colours ) . in this section",
    "we present a simple characterization of the stellar populations in seyfert 2s on the basis of a set of indices commonly used in the literature .      in order to provide an empirical characterization of stellar populations in our sample galaxies",
    ", we have measured a set of stellar indices directly from the observed spectra . to facilitate the comparison with previous studies , we have employed the index definitions used by cid fernandes ( 2004 ) , which are ultimately based on the studies by bica & alloin ( 1986a , b ) and bica ( 1988 ) of star cluster and galaxy spectra .",
    "we have measured the equivalent widths of the ca ii k ( @xmath143 ) , cn ( @xmath144 ) and g bands ( @xmath145 ) , as well as the colours @xmath146 and @xmath147 , defined as ratios between the continuum at 3660 and 4510   to the continuum at 4020  , respectively .",

    "we give particular emphasis to the k line .",
    "previous studies have shown that @xmath143 , which essentially measures the contrast between old and young populations , provides a useful mono - parametric description of stellar populations in galaxies .",
    "for instance , seyfert 2s with unambiguous signatures of recent star - formation ( such as uv wind lines , the wr bump , or high order balmer absorption lines ) all have k lines diluted to @xmath148   ( cf01 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : c3660_x_wk]a shows the @xmath143 versus @xmath146 diagram .",
    "this plot has the advantage of involving only direct measurements , which , in the case of the jo1 spectra , is not possible for more popular indices .",
    "the solid and dotted curves show the evolution of instantaneous burst bc03 models for solar ( solid , green line ) and 2.5 solar metallicity ( dotted , red ) .",
    "the region occupied by pure stellar populations in this diagram is delimited by these tracks and a mixing line joining the youngest and oldest models .",
    "points located below the bc03 models in the bottom - right of the plot are explained as a combination of observational errors and intrinsic reddening , both of which affect more the @xmath146 colour than @xmath143 .    the dashed line in figure [ fig : c3660_x_wk ] represents a mixing line , where a canonical agn @xmath85 power - law is added to an old stellar population in different proportions , from a pure power - law at @xmath149 to a pure @xmath150 yr population at @xmath151 .",

    "these histograms illustrate the frequency of recent star - formation in seyfert 2s .",
    "there are several possible definitions of `` recent star - formation '' , either in terms of observed quantities or model parameters .",

    "old stars , although present in all galaxies , only dominate the light ( @xmath163 ) in 31% of the cases . in terms @xmath164 , we find that 25 out of our 65 galaxies ( 38% ) have @xmath165 , ie , mean ages smaller than 300 myr . in summary , depending on the criterion adopted , between 1/3 and 1/2 of seyfert 2s have experienced significant star - formation in the past few hundred myr .",
    "these numbers are similar to those derived by j01 by means of a visual characterization of stellar populations for the same sample and with those obtained by storchi - bergmann ( 2001 ) for a sample @xmath166 half as big as ours .",
    "naturally , one would like to compare the incidence of recent star - formation in seyfert 2s to that in other types of nuclei .",
    "a particularly interesting comparison to be made is that between seyfert 2s and liners , given that these two classes were once thought to belong to the same family ( ferland & netzer 1983 ; halpern & steiner 1993 ) .",
    "we have too few liners in our sample to perform this comparison , but we may borrow from the results of cid fernandes ( 2004 ) and gonzlez delgado ( 2004 ) , who have recently surveyed the stellar populations of liners and liner / hii transition objects using spectroscopic data practically identical to the one used in this paper and a similar method of analysis .",
    "their results are _ very different _ from ours .",
    "for instance , while we find that over 2/3 of seyfert 2s have @xmath167 , most liners have @xmath168 , and are often dominated by old stars . still according to these authors , a large fraction of transition objects harbour significant numbers of @xmath52@xmath169 yr stars , similar to those found in @xmath88-dominated seyfert 2s ( eg , eso 362-g08 and mrk 1370 , figures [ fig : fit_j008 ] and [ fig : fit_j026 ] ) .",
    "their @xmath115 strength , however , is only 6% on average , compared to 23% for our seyfert 2s .",
    "thus , a substantial fraction of nearby seyfert 2s live in much younger stellar environments than liners or transition objects , which suggests an evolutionary sequence .",
    "given that the later objects are known to harbour less luminous agn and have different gas excitation conditions than seyferts , if confirmed , this would imply a substantial evolution of the agn itself  in parallel with the evolution of stars in its surroundings .",
    "spectra collected through apertures of fixed angular size sample distance - dependent linear scales , which may introduce systematic effects on the derived stellar population mixtures . in order to investigate whether such potential biases affect our results in some systematic way we plot in figure [ fig : distance_effect ] the equivalent width of caii k against the pc / arcsec scale .",
    "( recall that our observations cover an area of @xmath170 arcsec@xmath171 . )",
    "no systematic trend is observed between this stellar population tracer and the linear dimension of the regions sampled by our data .",
    "the same conclusion holds for the @xmath26 components , none of which correlates with distance either .",
    "the absence of systematic trends indicates that our analysis is not affected by aperture effects .",
    ".,width=340 ]      a galaxy s morphology carries important information for the study of star formation history in galaxies ( eg . , kennicutt 1998 ) . from early to late types , galaxy colours become bluer and star formation rates higher .",
    "storchi - bergmann ( 2001 ) studied the relationship between nuclear stellar population and morphology in a sample of 35 seyfert 2s , 13 in common with our sample .",
    "they found that the fraction of galaxies with recent nuclear / circumnuclear starburst increases along the hubble sequence and that there is a relation between the presence of a nuclear starburst and a late `` inner hubble type '' from the hst classifications of malkan , gorjian & tam ( 1998 ) .    in order to check this result in our larger sample",
    ", we have collected morphological information on the host galaxies from rc3 , and the inner hubble types from malkan ( 1998 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : morphology ] we plot three of our stellar population tracers ( w@xmath172 , x@xmath173 , and mean age ) against the rc3 and inner morphological types ( later types have larger numbers ) .",
    "there is no correlation in our sample between ( optical ) morphology and nuclear star formation .",
    "since the hst snapshot survey of malkan ( 1998 ) was taken using the f606w filter which is sensitive to dust extinction and h@xmath8 emission , we searched the hst / nicmos archive data and found images for 36 of our galaxies taken with the f160w filter .",
    "no clear trend between morphological type and nuclear stellar population is found in the near - ir images either .",
    "finally , following storchi - bergmann we also looked for companions to our seyfert 2s according to angular separation , radial velocity , and apparent magnitude .",
    "we find that 40% of the galaxies with @xmath160   and 47% of those with @xmath174   show the presence of companions , compared respectively with 42% and 47% that do not have near neighbours .",
    "hence , contrary to the findings of storchi - bergmann ( 2001 ) we find no correlation between the nuclear stellar populations of seyfert 2 galaxies and either morphological types or environments .",
    "since there is a substantial overlap between our samples , the discrepancy is most likely statistical .",
    "given the importance of the result , however , it would be worthwhile to repeat the study in an even larger sample of galaxies .",
    "we have presented a study of the stellar population in the central @xmath124500 pc of a large , well defined and homogeneous sample of seyfert 2s from the atlas of j01 .",
    "our main results may be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we have developed a spectral synthesis code which decomposes an observed spectrum as a sum of simple stellar populations , represented by state - of - the - art evolutionary synthesis models , plus an agn continuum . unlike previous studies , which use only a few absorption equivalent widths and colours ( eg bica 1988",
    "; schmitt 1999 ; cid fernandes 2001a , b ) , we now synthesize the whole observed spectrum .",
    "the method produces an estimate of the star - formation history in terms of flux ( @xmath26 ) or mass ( @xmath29 ) fractions associated to each component in the spectral base , as well as extinction and velocity dispersions . as in other population synthesis studies ,",
    "the accuracy of our method is limited by noise , spectral coverage , and intrinsic degeneracies of stellar populations .",
    "these limitations are not critical as long as one does not attempt an over - detailed description of the sfh .",
    "the synthesis method was applied to 35005200   spectra of 65 seyfert 2s and 14 other galaxies from the j01 atlas .",
    "the synthesis produces excellent fits of the observed spectra , with typical flux residuals of 25% . the star formation history deduced from these fits",
    "is remarkably varied among seyfert 2s .",
    "young starbursts , intermediate age , and old populations all appear in significant and mixed amounts .",
    "3 .   the stellar velocity dispersions obtained from the synthesis are in good agreement with measurements in the literature for galaxies in common .",
    "this is important since this information gives us a handle on the black - hole mass ( ferrarese & merrit 2000 ; gebhart 2000 ) .",
    "4 .   the starlight - subtracted spectra were used to investigate the presence of weak broad emission features which are hard to detect in the total spectrum .",
    "this analysis revealed the signatures of wr stars in 3 ( maybe 5 ) seyfert 2s , all of which have large young stellar populations as deduced by the synthesis .",
    "5 .   the analysis of the `` pure - emission '' spectra further allowed the detection of a weak blr - like component under h@xmath1 in several seyfert 2s . for most of these objects",
    "independent spectropolarimetry data reveals a type 1 spectrum .",
    "we are thus detecting in direct , non - polarized light the scattered blr predicted by the unified model .",
    "the detection of a blr either in direct or polarized light implies that an associated fc should also be present in our spectrum .",
    "indeed , the fc strengths obtained by the spectral decomposition for the 17 seyfert 2s in our sample which present such evidence are substantially larger than for nuclei with no indications of a blr .",
    "the fraction of these `` broad line seyfert 2s '' increases systematically with increasing @xmath86 .",
    "dusty young starbursts can also appear disguised as an agn - looking continuum .",
    "we have identified several cases where this indeed happens .",
    "these seyfert 2s tend to have large @xmath86 _ and _ @xmath87 fractions .",
    "the information on the existence of a blr , and thus of a true fc component , helps breaking , at least partly , this starburst - fc degeneracy . whenever the spectral synthesis identifies a strong ( @xmath175 ) fc but no blr is detected either in the residual or polarized spectra , the fc is most likely dominated by a dusty starburst rather than scattering of a hidden agn .",
    "stellar indices were measured both from the observed and synthetic spectra to provide a more empirical characterization of the stellar content of our galaxies and facilitate comparisons with independent studies .",
    "these indices , which include @xmath143 , the 3660/4020 colour , @xmath155 and h@xmath156 , confirm the heterogeneity of nuclear stellar populations in seyfert 2s . 9 .   between 1/3 and 1/2 of nearby seyfert 2s have experienced significant star formation in the recent past .",
    "thus , as a class , seyfert 2 nuclei live in a much younger stellar environment than liners and normal galactic nuclei",
    "we find no significant correlation between the host morphology ( as deduced both from ground based and hst optical and near - ir images ) and stellar population in seyfert 2s .",
    "the presence of companions does not seem to correlate with the stellar populations either .",
    "we have shown that using modern population synthesis models it is possible to obtain meaningful information about the history of star formation in objects for which the spectral data are dominated by strong emission lines .",
    "the road to detailed quantitative investigations of the relationship between star - formation and agn is now open .",
    "we will be traveling along it in our forthcoming papers .",

    "<S> these are most likely the weak scattered lines from the hidden broad line region envisaged in the unified model , given that in most of these cases independent spectropolarimetry data finds a hidden seyfert 1 . ( 4 ) the fc strengths obtained by the spectral decomposition are substantially larger for the seyfert 2s which present evidence of broad lines , implying that the scattered non - stellar continuum is also detected . </S>",
