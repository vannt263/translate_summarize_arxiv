    "modern medical imaging modalities can provide a great amount of information to study the human anatomy and physiological functions in both space and time . in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) for example",
    ", several slices can be acquired to cover the heart in 3d and at a collection of discrete time samples over the cardiac cycle . from these partial observations ,",
    "the challenge is to extract the heart s dynamics from these input spatio - temporal data throughout the cardiac cycle @xcite , @xcite .",
    "image registration consists in estimating a transformation which insures the warping of one reference image onto another target image ( supposed to present some similarity ) .",
    "continuous transformations are privileged , the sequence of transformations during the estimation process is usually not much considered .",
    "most important is the final resulting transformation and not the way one image will be transformed to the other . here",
    ", we consider a reasonable registration process to continuously map the image intensity functions between two images in the context of cardiac motion estimation and modeling .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present , in the context of extended optical flow , an algorithm to compute the optimal time dependent transportation plan without using lagrangian techniques .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the introduction is ended , by recalling the optimal extended optical flow model ( oeof ) . in section 2 , the algorithm we propose is presented .",
    "its convergence is discussed . in section 3",
    "it is proved that solutions obtained with the proposed algorithm are solutions to the optimal extended optical flow , that is to say to the time dependent optimal mass transportation problem .",
    "section 4 deals with numerical results .",
    "a 2d cardiac medical image is considered .",
    "let us denote by @xmath3 the intensity function , and by @xmath4 the velocity of the apparent motion of brightness pattern .",
    "an image sequence is considered via the gray - value map @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a bounded regular domain , the support of images , for @xmath7 . if image points move according to the velocity field @xmath8 , then gray values @xmath9 are constant along motion trajectories @xmath10 .",
    "one obtains the optical flow equation : @xmath11    the assumption that the pixel intensity does not change during the movement is in some cases too restrictive .",
    "a weakened assumption sometimes called extended optical flow , can replace the intensity preservation by a mass preservation condition which reads : @xmath12 the previous equations lead to an ill - posed problem for the unknown @xmath13 .",
    "variational formulations or relaxed minimizing problems for computing jointly @xmath13 have been first proposed in @xcite and after by many other authors . here",
    "our concern is somewhat different .",
    "finding @xmath13 simultaneously is possible by solving the optimal mass transport problem - , developed in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be the cardiac images between two times arbitrary fixed to zero and one , the mathematical problem reads : find @xmath3 the gray level function defined from @xmath14 with values in @xmath15 $ ] verifying @xmath16 the velocity function @xmath4 is determined in order to minimize the functional : @xmath17 thus we get an image sequence through the gray - value map @xmath3 .",
