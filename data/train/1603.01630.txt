    "the equation of state of cold , stable matter at densities that exceed the nuclear saturation density ( @xmath6  g  @xmath7 ) remains one of the principal outstanding problems in nuclear physics .",
    "neutron stars ( nss ) provide a unique setting where the properties of neutron - rich matter at extreme conditions can be probed .",
    "this is because the mass - radius ( @xmath8 ) relation of nss is determined by the dense matter equation of state ( eos ) and , in turn , measuring the mass @xmath9 and radius @xmath10 of several nss with @xmath1110% errors can place strong limits on the eos at high densities ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is well established that observing thermal radiation from the surface of a ns can serve as a useful tool towards this end . for",
    "a ns radiating uniformly from its entire surface , one can derive constraints on its mass and radius by fitting its spectrum with an appropriate atmosphere model  when the surface composition is known or can be determined from the x - ray spectrum itself  and combining the spectroscopic measurements with the distance to the source .",
    "low magnetic field ( @xmath12@xmath13 g ) sources are typically chosen for such studies so that the radiation transport or temperature distribution on the stellar surface are not affected by the magnetic field ( see reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these criteria are met in quiescent low - mass x - ray binaries ( qlmxbs ) containing nss and , in particular , for those located in globular clusters , to which the distances are well - constrained @xcite . in these systems , the heat stored in the nss is believed to be deposited by nuclear fusion in the deep crust during accretion , and is reradiated from the whole surface when accretion ceases , producing a long - lived thermal glow @xcite .",
    "their low magnetic fields ( @xmath5@xmath14 g ) as well as their primarily thermal spectra make qlmxbs fairly clean laboratories for studies of fundamental ns physics . as such , they can provide potentially strong constraints on ns structure that are complementary to those obtained using other techniques .    the observed thermal x - ray radiation from qlmxbs is modeled by light - element atmospheres because the lightest element that is present floats to the top of the atmosphere due to rapid gravitational settling on neutron star surfaces .",
    "light - element atmospheres shift the peak of the emitted radiation to higher energies compared to a planck spectrum of the same effective temperature because of the strong dependence of free - free absorption on photon energy and the large temperature gradients in such atmospheres @xcite . by applying the non - magnetic ns hydrogen atmosphere models of @xcite to x - ray observations of qlmxbs",
    ", @xcite obtained the first broad constraints on their radii .",
    "these earlier analyses of x - ray spectra from neutron stars with hydrogen atmosphere models produced radius estimates that are in reasonable agreement with theoretical predictions .",
    "these findings motivated a host of subsequent observations primarily using _ chandra _ and , to a lesser extent , _ xmm - newton _ , in an attempt to place tighter constraints on the ns radius .",
    "the known qlmxbs in globular clusters , in particular , have been subject of intensive studies , including x7 and x5 in 47 tuc @xcite , u24 in ngc 6397 @xcite , source 26 in m28 @xcite , ngc 2808 @xcite , m13 @xcite , @xmath15 centauri @xcite , and m30 @xcite .",
    "radius constraints obtained for qlmxbs from the different analyses have been combined and used for constraining the neutron star eos .",
    "@xcite applied bayesian analysis techniques on the data for five qlmxbs to determine the combined mass - radius relation . in this study",
    ", a number of sources of measurement uncertainty were incorporated into the final constraints , but some systematic uncertainties were not explored @xcite .",
    "these include the possibility of a helium instead of hydrogen atmosphere for a subset of the sources as well as the effects of the model used for the relative abundances of the intervening absorbing material on the derived radius constraints . in a subsequent study of six qlmxbs , including those from @xcite , @xcite carried out a uniform analysis of these sources , taking into account the additional sources of uncertainty and found good agreement between all measurements .",
    "furthermore , combining the qlmxb measurements with the radius measurements obtained during thermonuclear bursts led to a combined ns radius of @xmath16  km ( 95% c.l . ) and to tight constraints on the dense matter equation of state .",
    "this comprehensive study , however , excluded two of the earlier qlmxb radius constraints , namely those of x5 and x7 @xcite due to concerns in the quality of the spectral data in these earlier _ chandra _ observations , as we describe below .    the globular cluster 47 tuc ( ngc 104 ) hosts x7 and x5 , with the highest and second - highest x - ray flux at earth of any qlmxb in a globular cluster , making them well - suited targets for ns eos constraints .",
    "a 270-ks _ chandra _ observation of 47 tuc in 2002 @xcite produced a spectrum of x7 with a high number of counts , which allowed the first measurements on the mass and radius of this source @xcite . using the nsatmos hydrogen atmosphere model in xspec , for an assumed ns mass of 1.4 m@xmath2 , the stellar radius was constrained to be @xmath17 km ( 90% c.l . ) .",
    "however , because the 270-ks _ chandra _ acis - s exposure of 47  tuc was obtained in full - frame mode with a read - out time of 3.2 seconds , x7 suffered from strong event pile - up .",
    "this resulted in substantial degradation in the quality of the spectrum .",
    "furthermore , an extra model component to account for pile - up was required when fitting the spectrum , with a pile - up parameter that was estimated to be 15% in the 2002 full - frame dataset .",
    "it is difficult to quantify the systematic uncertainty introduced into the radius measurement by pile - up for two reasons .",
    "first , even though the pile - up correction is theoretically sound and verified to give reasonable results , is not as well - calibrated as _ chandra _",
    "s performance in the absence of pile - up , especially when the pile - up fraction is as high as 15% @xcite .",
    "second , the inferred radius is highly sensitive to the spectral shape , which is not possible to fully correct for . in light of this , it is clear that minimizing pile - up is critical for obtaining reliable constraints on the ns @xmath8 relation with qlmxbs .",
    "x5 , an x - ray binary that is viewed edge - on @xcite , on the other hand , shows eclipses with an 8.7-hour period and irregular energy - dependent dipping .",
    "the hydrogen column density @xmath18 to x5 was high and variable during the 2002 acis - s observations but less so during the 2000 acis - i and 2005 hrc - s observations .",
    "the accretion disk in x5 appears to precess , occasionally blocking the view of the ns , as it did in 2002 .",

    "for the analysis presented here , we focus on new _ chandra _ acis - s exposures totaling 181  ks that were acquired between 2014 september and 2015 february .",
    "the observations are summarized in table  1 . during the exposures , only the acis - s3 chip was active and",
    "was configured in a custom 1/8 sub - array , which restricts the region of the ccd in which data is taken to 128 rows , starting at row 449 ( inclusive ) .",
    "this 1/8 subarray affords a 0.4  s frame time , which dramatically reduces the pile - up fraction of moderately bright sources such as x7 and x5 .",
    "the data extraction was carried out using ciao @xcite version 4.7 and the corresponding calibration database ( caldb 4.6.7 ) .",
    "for each observation , the source counts were extracted from circular regions of radius 2.5@xmath19 centered on the wavdetect - derived positions of both x5 and x7 , which enclose @xmath2095% of the total source energy .",
    "the background was obtained from a source - free region on the image .",
    "the spectra from the individual observations were generated using specextract and were co - added using the combine_spectra task in ciao . due to known spectral calibration issues with acis - s data around 0.4 kev ,",
    "we restrict our spectroscopic analysis to energies @xmath210.5 kev .    using the ciao tool pileup_map",
    ", we determined that the highest count rates per frame were 0.029 and 0.025 for x7 and x5 , respectively , corresponding to a pile - up level of @xmath201% .",
    "while there are archival sub - array observations from 2000 and 2002 , they were acquired in a 1/4 array size , which provides a 0.8 s readout time and hence a higher pile - up fraction .",
    "based on this and the short total exposure of these data ( 26 ks ) , we do not consider them in the spectral analysis used to derive the @xmath8 constraints presented below .",
    "we do , however , make use of these observations to examine the long - term variability of x7 .",
    "in order to utilize qlmxbs as high - precision probes of ns structure , it is important to explore and quantify the effect of any instrument or modeling uncertainties on the desired ns @xmath8 measurement . following the investigations presented in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we examine in this section several potentially important sources of measurement uncertainty and bias that may affect the eos constraints obtained for x7 and x5 .",
    "rapid ( seconds / hours ) and long - term ( @xmath5years ) variability in qlmxbs is often taken as an indicator of on - going low - level accretion onto the neutron star .",
    "in such an event , the assumptions of a steady - state , passively cooling atmosphere , a purely thermal flux from the surface , or a uniformly hot star may no longer be valid . @xcite and @xcite have evaluated the variability of the thermal emission from 9 and 12 qlmxbs , respectively ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * for individual sources ) .",
    "for the 7 qlmxbs with purely thermal spectra , there is no evidence for temperature variations over @xmath510 years down to levels of 11% .",
    "the multi - epoch and high - quality _ chandra _ acis data set of x7 spanning @xmath515 years allows us to place substantially stricter limits on the variability of its thermal radiation using spectral fits to the 2014/2015 combined data , and to the 2000 and 2002 subarray data800 ks ) _ chandra _ hrc - s data set provides no spectral information , it is not useful in this regard . ] .",
    "for the most stringent test , we kept all parameters fixed except for the temperature in 2014/2015 and 2000/2002 , which were allowed to vary independently . we find that the temperatures are virtually identical ; at 90% confidence",
    "there is no observable temperature variation greater than 0.9% between the 2000/2002 and 2014/2015 epochs .",
    "testing the normalization ( which would correspond to any change in the emitting area ) instead , we place an upper limit of 4% to any change in normalization at 90% confidence .",
    "this is an indication that the observed radiation from x7 is indeed due to passive transport of the heat deposited in the stellar core during outbursts rather than continuing accretion .",
    "in contrast , the thermal x - ray flux of x5 is highly variable on short timescales ( minutes to hours ) .",
    "however , this variability appears not to be due to on - going accretion but rather due to x5 being an edge - on system .",
    "this geometric configuration results in occultations of the neutron star and variable absorption by the gas associated with the residual accretion disk .",
    "as detailed in  4 , this necessitates the excision of a large fraction of the data for x5 in order to recover the intrinsic steady flux from the neutron star .",
    "additionally , due to disk precession , the ns was completely obscured during the deep 2002 exposures , making it difficult to fully assess the long term variability of the thermal component for x5 .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or unidentified blended sources in the crowded globular cluster core .",
    "it is possible that such a component is present at a very low level in the seemingly purely thermal qlmxbs but may still skew the ns radius measurement significantly if it is not accounted for .",
    "in particular , the presence of a power - law component would harden the spectrum so that a fit with a purely thermal model would produce a higher temperature and , therefore , @xmath8 limits that are shifted towards lower radii .",
    "to test this scenario , we introduced an additional power - law component into the model fits .",
    "figure  1 illustrates the maximum possible contribution of a power - law component to the model spectrum of x7 for photon indices in the range typical for quiescent lmxb power - laws , @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the addition of a power - law results in a difference of @xmath27% in the inferred nominal ns radius and its associated uncertainties , while the best fits with and without this component differ in @xmath28 by a statistically insignificant 0.03 .",
    "we found a similar result for x5 , where the introduction of a power - law causes a change of only 0.5% in the ns radius confidence limits . for x7 and x5",
    ", we also derive limits of @xmath290.2% and @xmath291.6% , respectively , for any power - law component in the subarray spectra .",
    "we thus conclude that power - law emission is negligible for both of these qlmxbs and do not further consider a power - law component in the spectroscopic analyses that follow .      given their transiently accreting nature , the thin atmospheric layer on the neutron stars found in qlmxbs most likely consists of material that has the composition of their companion star . for a hydrogen rich donor , due to gravitational settling , hydrogen is expected to surface within seconds and thus dominate the surface emission @xcite .    for x5 , the measured 8.7-hour orbit @xcite implies",
    "that the donor star is hydrogen - rich and , therefore , the neutron star almost certainly has a pure hydrogen atmosphere . in the case of x7 , due to the lack of any information regarding the orbital period or the properties of the secondary star ,",
    "the chemical composition of the accreted material is less certain .",
    "for example , this system may be an ultra - compact binary ( with an orbital period @xmath3080 min ) , in which case the companion star may be a helium star or a c - o core white dwarf that has surface layers ( mostly ) devoid of hydrogen ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in light of this possibility ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have considered he atmosphere fits to qlmxb spectra when there is no information about the nature of the companion .",
    "these fits produce significantly larger inferred ns masses and radii compared to h atmosphere models , owing to the larger difference between the effective and color temperatures for he atmosphere emission .",
    "these results highlight the importance of the chemical composition of the ns surface layer on the ns @xmath9 and @xmath10 measurements .",
    "even in the case of an ultracompact binary and a hydrogen - poor companion , the question remains as to whether even trace amounts of hydrogen in the donor are sufficient to cover the neutron star surface with hydrogen .",
    "an optical depth of @xmath5unity can be achieved with a layer of hydrogen of thickness @xmath51 cm on the neutron star surface , which requires only @xmath5@xmath31 m@xmath2 of h ( see , e.g. , @xcite and eq .",
    "( 20 ) of @xcite ) . as a result , even in the case of an ultracompact binary with accretion from a he - rich donor , minute abundances of h can still result in a hydrogen dominated atmosphere .",
    "an alternative means of accumulating a hydrogen atmosphere may be through nuclear spallation reactions of nuclei heavier than helium .",
    "however , it is not certain whether spallation always produces h during accretion @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , h can be depleted from the photospheric layer via diffusive nuclear burning by an underlying layer of nuclei that are able to capture protons ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "due to this ambiguity regarding the atmospheric composition , in  4 we present fits with both h and he atmospheres for x7 .",
    "photoelectric absorption by the interstellar medium along the line of sight to the qlmxb significantly alters the intrinsic thermal spectrum of the ns , especially in the very soft x - ray band .",
    "thus , a reliable constraint on the hydrogen column density along the line of sight , @xmath18 , is important for robust ns eos constraints ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "in addition to the total column density , the observed shape of the thermal spectrum is also sensitive to the chemical abundances of the intervening material . as a consequence",
    ", the inferred @xmath8 constraints may differ based on the assumed ism abundances .",
    "this is especially true for targets with large values of column density @xmath18 since the absorption edges due to metals ( whose depth depends on the relative abundances ) become much more prominent .",
    "as demonstrated by @xcite , the strong sensitivity of the inferred ns radius on the choice of ism abundances implies that low-@xmath18 targets are best suited for the neutron star eos constraints .",
    "in addition , the latest abundances and most complete absorption models that are appropriate for the ism should be used in the spectral analyses .",
    "the currently best available abundances for the ism ( as opposed to values derived from the solar spectrum ) is that of @xcite ( wilm in xspec , incorporated into the absorption model _ tbabs _ ) , which we use in our analysis .",
    "nevertheless , to test the sensitivity of the results on the absorption model , we also repeated the spectroscopic fits by implementing two other abundance models available in xspec : aspl @xcite and lodd @xcite , both of which are based on solar abundances . as is evident from figure  2",
    ", the choice of absorption model does not alter the model spectral shape above @xmath50.5  kev due to the exceptionally low absorbing column towards 47  tuc ( @xmath32 @xmath33 ) .",
    "therefore , using different abundance models has virtually no effect on the derived @xmath8 relation .",
    "specifically , for a fixed @xmath1 m@xmath2 , the best fit value and associated uncertainties of @xmath10 differ by less than @xmath34% among the three abundance models .",
    "as shown below , for both x7 and x5 this level of uncertainty introduced by the choice of abundance model is dwarfed by the uncertainties due to instrument calibration .",
    "another important source of uncertainty in the radius measurements is the distance to the target qlmxb , which scales linearly with the ns radius .",
    "globular cluster distances have been constrained using a variety of different methods , each of which has its own statistical and systematic errors ( which may not always be well - characterized ) .",
    "fortunately , 47  tuc has been a target for multiple distance investigations , giving us the opportunity to compare the results from multiple methods .",

    "the methods include the brightness of the horizontal branch , fitting an isochrone to the main sequence , cluster kinematics , rr lyrae stars , the tip of the red giant branch , eclipsing binaries , and white dwarfs .",
    "we add to this list the recent white dwarf cooling sequence measurement of @xcite , which reports a distance modulus of @xmath35 magnitudes .",
    "following @xcite , we calculated the weighted mean of all these estimates and the error in this mean to obtain a distance modulus of @xmath36 , corresponding to a distance of @xmath37  kpc . for this calculation ,",
    "( i ) we assumed errors of 0.20 magnitudes for literature estimates without errors , ( ii ) we added statistical and systematic errors in quadrature , and ( iii ) chose the estimate with binary corrections from the main - sequence fitting analyses of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this analysis has several weaknesses .",
    "first , multiple measurements using the same method may lead to smaller statistical uncertainties but still contain a bias .",
    "second , improvements in a method over time may not be reflected in the final calculation if all measurements are assigned equal weights .",
    "finally , the final measurement could be significantly affected by results from a single flawed method . to address these",
    ", we performed a test by selecting the subset of more recent distance measurements , i.e. , those carried out since 2000 .",
    "we also undertook `` jackknife '' analyses , where we removed all measurements taken with one method to assess how much the final result changes and used the results of this exercise as another measure of the systematic error . when using the measurements since 2000 , we find a distance modulus of @xmath38 or a distance of @xmath39  kpc , which is consistent with the distance measurement from the full sample .",
    "our jackknife tests find a range of distance moduli from @xmath40 to @xmath41 , which are also consistent with the results from the full sample .",
    "combining the jackknife errors with the error in the mean in quadrature , we arrive at a final range in distance modulus of @xmath42 and , thus , a final distance measurement of @xmath43  kpc .",
    "we note that we excluded from our distance analysis the most recent measurement of @xcite , who obtained a significantly smaller dynamical distance for 47  tuc ( @xmath44  kpc ) , compared to the mean value derived above .",
    "this is because we believe that this reported value is affected by problems in some of the radial velocity data used in that study .",
    "dynamical distances are derived by comparing angular proper motions on the sky ( typically from multiple _ hubble space telescope _",
    "epochs ) with radial velocity dispersions of bright stars .",
    "the radial velocity measurements carried out by @xcite and @xcite were of individual stars , but these studies did not check whether multiple stars might be blended together ( as attempted by * ? ? ?",
    "such blending tends to depress the line - of - sight velocity dispersion in the central regions .",
    "indeed , such blending within the central @xmath51@xmath45 can be verified by comparing the positions of stars used for radial velocities in 47  tuc by @xcite with the _ hst _ image provided in the same paper , and the radial velocity measurements within this central region show more scatter than elsewhere .",
    "@xcite only used velocity dispersion information from the central regions ( within @xmath11100@xmath19 ) for their primary analysis , to ensure that proper motions and radial velocity dispersions were compared within the same region .",
    "however , in an appendix , @xcite show that including velocity dispersion information from the outer regions leads to a larger inferred distance of @xmath46  kpc .",
    "thus , we have a plausible explanation for the discrepancy between the fiducial distance reported by @xcite , and the larger distance supported by photometric methods , and by the consideration of a larger radial velocity database .",
    "the spectroscopic @xmath8 measurement technique using qlmxbs discussed herein relies on an absolute determination of the flux emitted from the neutron star . because of this",
    ", it depends strongly on the reliability of the calibration of the instrument used for the measurement .",
    "knowledge of the absolute effective area of the _ chandra _ acis detectors is limited by a combination of the uncertainties in the quantum efficiency near the read out , the quantum efficiency non - uniformity across the detector resulting from charge transfer inefficiencies , and the depth of the contaminant on the acis filter ( important primarily below @xmath52 kev ) .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt a 3% systematic error to account for the instrument response uncertainties .",

    ", it still affects the data at a low level .",
    "the spectroscopic mass - radius measurement technique for qlmxbs is highly sensitive to the shape of the thermal spectrum . as a consequence ,",
    "even a small artifical distortion in the spectral shape can bias the @xmath8 measurement . for pile - up specifically , a portion of the photons piled at lower energies are either rejected entirely ( if their event grades are consistent with those of cosmic rays ) or recorded as a singe photon displaced to higher energies . as reported in  2 , this occurs for @xmath51% of the photons in the x7 and x5 spectra , which we would naively expect to be negligible .",
    "to assess the impact of this seemingly small effect on our results , we repeated our spectroscopic fits with and without a pile - up model component ( i.e. , pileup in xspec ) .",
    "figure  3 illustrates the results for x7 , showing the 68% confidence contours in the @xmath8 plane with and without pile - up . despite the small degree of pile - up ,",
    "the impact on the results is substantial .",
    "in addition to enlarging the confidence intervals , correcting for pile - up displaces them towards somewhat larger @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this arises because photon pile - up artificially hardens the intrinsic source spectrum , which produces a higher best - fit temperature and hence a smaller inferred stellar radius .",
    "the enlargement of the confidence contours arises principally from the statistical uncertainty in the pile - up parameter @xmath47 , which gives the probability of rejection of piled events .",
    "some of the displacement in the contours may also be due to adding another parameter to the fit when applying pile - up correction . in light of these findings , to ensure robust constraints on the ns @xmath9 and @xmath10 , pile - up correction should be incorporated into spectral modeling even for small ( @xmath51 - 2% ) pile - up fractions .",
    "having explored the various sources of formal and systematic errors , we performed the optimal spectroscopic fits in xspec using the nsatmos h atmosphere model @xcite for both x5 and x7 as well as the non - magnetic he atmosphere variant of the nsx additive table model @xcite for x7 .",

    "the nsatmos and nsagrav models produce virtually identical results for the expected range of combinations of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",

    "we find that a he atmosphere model would require either a quite large radius or a high mass .",
    "a high mass would be at odds with our current understanding of cooling processes based on other qlmxbs , while a large radius ( @xmath10114 km ) would conflict both with the measurements of the radius of x5 presented here , and with measurements of other nss @xcite , including the radius derived for the ns in ngc 6397 for either h or he atmospheres . based on this line of reasoning",

    "most existing mass - radius measurements of neutron star have uncertainties that are too large to offer useful constraints when considered individually . nevertheless ,",
    "as shown recently in @xcite , when taken as an ensemble , these results can produce fairly tight constraints on the equation of state .",
    "we now add the @xmath8 measurements of x7 and x5 to those used in the earlier study to infer the ns equation of state .    to accomplish this , we make use of the bayesian statistical framework developed in @xcite to measure the most likely dense matter equation of state and the corresponding neutron star radii from all of the spectroscopic measurements .",
    "this framework makes use of parametric representations of the equation of state and allows us to use these radius measurements to directly infer the pressures at several fiducial densities above the nuclear saturation density , i.e. , at @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 by exploiting the unique mapping between the pressure - density relation of cold supra - nuclear matter and the neutron star @xmath8 relation @xcite .",
    "this statistical inference also allows us to consider additional information and constraints on the dense matter equation of state , such as the results of laboratory experiments in the vicinity of nuclear saturation density ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , the requirement for a @xmath212 m@xmath2 maximum neutron star mass @xcite,(also , see reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the physical conditions of stability and causality for the parametric equation of state , as well as different priors on the pressures @xmath105 , and @xmath106 at the fiducial densities ( see section  5 of @xcite for additional details ) .",
    "using this framework , we combine the radius likelihoods for x7 and x5 presented here with those of the twelve sources included in @xcite to infer the posterior likelihoods over the pressures at the three fiducial densities . in figure  10 , we show the mass - radius relation that corresponds to the most likely triplet of pressures that is derived from the combined likelihoods of the fourteen sources as well as the priors on the eos discussed above . specifically , these include the hydrogen atmosphere results for x7 , based on the arguments in  5.1 , as well as the six neutron stars for which thermonuclear burst data have been used to infer @xmath9 and @xmath10 and the six qlmxbs analyzed in zel et al .",
    "we also show in figure  10 the ranges of mass - radius relations that correspond to the regions of the @xmath107 parameter space in which the posterior likelihood is within @xmath108 and @xmath109 of its highest value . for comparison , we include in this figure a small selection of proposed eos with different compositions and calculation techniques ( see @xcite for the acronyms and further details ) .",
    "it is evident from this figure that the empirical equation of state that is preferred by the current radius measurements is consistent with relatively small radii . in particular , around @xmath110 , the 95% confidence range spans 9.9 to 11.2  km .",
    "this also indicates a fairly soft eos ; i.e. , a lower pressure at and above @xmath111 than those predicted by a number of nucleonic equations of state , such as ap4 @xcite shown in this figure .",
    "we presented spectroscopically derived neutron star mass - radius constraints for the qlmxbs x5 and x7 in the globular cluster 47 tuc based on new _ chandra _ observations that were specifically optimized for this purpose .",
    "although significantly shorter than the previous 270-ks acis - s full - frame exposure of 47 tuc @xcite , the 181-ks 1/8 subarray data of 47 tuc we have presented here results in much tighter constraints on the @xmath8 relation for x7 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the use of a faster readout mode for the acis - s detector , which significantly reduced the pile - up fraction ( from @xmath515% to @xmath51% ) and , therefore , the distortion of the spectra due to the effects of pile - up .",
    "furthermore , this substantially reduces the unquantified systematic uncertainties introduced by pile - up , which exibits non - linear behavior as a function of count rate and is not well calibrated .",
    "indeed , the limits on @xmath9 and @xmath10 for x7 obtained in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see , in particular , their figure 2 ) are only marginally consistent with those shown in figure 9 using the same nsatmos h atmosphere model .",
    "this leads us to conclude that qlmxb data affected by a high pile - up fraction are not useful for reliable ns eos constraints .",
    "another important finding of our evaluation of sources of measurement uncertainty described in  3 is that even at a level of @xmath51% , ignoring photon pile - up in the spectroscopic fits can lead to not only underestimated uncertainties but also a skewed measurement ( as illustrated in figures 3 and 4 ) .",
    "this suggests that all previous qlmxb analyses that have not applied any necessary pile - up corrections in the spectroscopic fits should be re - examined .",
    "( note that pile - up is well below 1% for a number of _ chandra _ observations of qlmxbs and the previous analyses of the qlmxb in m28 take into account a pile - up correction for a @xmath112 pile - up fraction in those data ; see @xcite . )    unlike most other globular cluster qlmxbs , the observed spectra of x7 and x5 are not strongly attenuated by photoelectric absorption from interstellar gas . as a result",
    ", the spectroscopic constraints we have obtained here do not suffer from appreciable uncertainties due to lack of information on the relative chemical abundances of the interstellar medium ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* , for further details ) .",
    "when taken together with other factors , such as the well - determined distance to 47 tuc , this makes the x7 radius measurements and the resulting ns eos constraints presented here some of the most robust based on this spectrosopic technique .",
    "the mass and radius constraints we find for x5 and x7 through these new observations are highly consistent with the twelve other spectroscopic radius measurements that have been performed to date for qlmxbs and thermonuclear bursters ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the increase in the radius measurements as well as the consistency of the results for different sources with a variety of different uncertainties increases our confidence in these measurements .",
    "furthermore , it allows us to place increasingly tighter constraints on the dense matter equation of state , especially when combined with other measurements , such as nuclear experiments near nuclear saturation density and the high neutron star masses measured through pulsar timing .    indeed , by combining the results for x5 and x7 with existing @xmath8 measurements from other qlmxb as well as bursting neutron stars",
    ", we obtain increasingly more robust constraints on the neutron star equation of state .",
    "specifically , we find that the preferred equation of state that is empirically derived from the measurements of all fourteen sources predicts radii between 9.9 and 11.2  km around @xmath113 ( corresponding to the range where the likelihood falls to @xmath109 of its maximum value ) .",
    "this also implies a relatively low pressure around twice nuclear saturation density , which most directly affects neutron star radii .",
    "we find that such an equation of state can easily produce @xmath114 neutron stars that is observed through radio pulsar timing .",
    "this preferred equation of state is softer than some purely nucleonic equations of state that are tuned to fit experiments at low densities , such as ap4 , and may point to new degrees of freedom appearing around @xmath115 in neutron - rich matter .",
