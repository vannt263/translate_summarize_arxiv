    "although it is widely accepted that the hubble classification represents an underlying physical sequence , it is still difficult to construct a complete picture that describes the evolution of galaxy morphologies . to achieve a satisfactory understanding of the actual structure of galaxies and their evolution , it is important to separate the bulge and disk components .",
    "historically , different authors have used the @xmath2 law ( de vaucouleurs 1948 ) to model the light distribution of bulges and the exponential law ( freeman 1970 ) for disks . in recent years",
    ", astronomers have also been using the srsic law ( srsic , 1968 ) to fit the surface brightness of galaxies .",
    "this new approach started with davies et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and was continued by caon et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , young & currie ( 1994 ) , and was further discussed by binggeli & jerjen ( 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "andredakis & sanders ( 1994 ) , de jong ( 1996 ) , carollo ( 1998 ) and others have found that the exponential profile provides a better fit to late type galaxies and suggested a range for the shape parameter @xmath5 ( the exponent @xmath5 the srsic profile ) to fit the bulge of spiral galaxies .",
    "structural parameters , such as the effective radius @xmath4 , the effective surface brightness @xmath8 and the parameter @xmath5 , are correlated by various relations , whose physical origins reside on the properties of the stellar populations of galaxies and on the dynamical structure of the systems . for the stellar population found in early type galaxies ,",
    "one of the most interesting correlation between bulge structural parameters is the kormendy relation ( kormendy 1977 ) .",
    "this relation is a projection of the fundamental plane and it has the advantage that it can be constructed from photometric observations alone .",
    "the slope of the kormendy relation is an important tool to study the properties of the galaxy stellar population as a function of galaxy size ( ziegler et al .",
    "a similar relation was found for disk galaxies in clusters ( schade et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "several studies have been performed to determine the photometric properties of galaxy bulges and disks in clusters ( binggeli & jerjen 1997 , 1998 ) , and the possible correlation between these properties .",
    "more recently , gavazzi et al . ( 2000 ) studied the near - infrared photometric properties of galaxies located in five nearby clusters .",
    "they found that less than 50% of the elliptical galaxies have pure @xmath2 profiles .",
    "the majority of galaxies from e to sb are best represented by @xmath9 profiles , while scd galaxies have pure exponential profiles .",
    "in addition , they found that the type of decomposition depends on luminosity rather than on hubble type .",
    "this is in agreement with the idea that ellipticals and dwarf ellipticals have different properties and therefore form two separate classes ( faber et al .",
    "1997 , nieto et al .",
    "however , this idea stands in constrast with the findings of e.g. jerjen & binggeli ( 1997 ) , and others that there is only one scaling relation between the srsic shape parameter and the absolute magnitude from giants to dwarfs over 8 orders of magnitudes , suggesting only one class of early - type galaxies . in a recent work thomas ( 2002 ) studied the structural parameters of galaxies from the enacs ( eso nearby abell cluster survey ) and found correlations for structural and photometric parameters of the galaxy components .",
    "in this paper we fit the luminosity profile and provide the photometric parameters for 507 galaxies selected from 14 southern abell clusters of the sars survey .",
    "we also analyze the basic photometric scaling relations .",
    "the correlation between galaxy photometric parameters and cluster properties will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : sample selection and observations are described in section [ data ] , we examine the luminosity profiles of the cluster galaxies and we analyze the sky cleaning and seeing effects over the luminosity profiles in section [ method ] . in section [ results ]",
    "we show the profile fitting results and we examine the relations between the obtained photometric parameters .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in section [ concl ] .",
    "we have obtained ccd images in the r cousins filter of 14 abell clusters with @xmath10 40000 @xmath11 corresponding to the sars survey ( southern abell clusters redshifts survey , way et al .",
    "the sars survey comprises abell ( 1958 ) and abell corwin & olowin ( 1989 ) clusters with richness class @xmath12 in the region @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( avoiding the lmc and smc ) , with @xmath15 .",
    "this redshift survey has more than 4000 galaxies that were selected from the apm catalog ( maddox et al .",
    "1990 ) as follows : galaxies brighter than @xmath16 and within 1.5x1.5 @xmath17 centered on each cluster were pre - selected .",
    "target galaxies were selected at random and the final completeness ( @xmath18 75% ) is roughly constant up to an apparent magnitude @xmath18 18 .",
    "spectroscopic observations were carried out with the 2.5 meter dupont telescope of the las campanas observatory , chile .",
    "the ccd images of the central region ( 21x21@xmath19 ) of the 14 sars clusters analyzed in this paper were taken on august 1993 by two of us ( hq & li ) with the swope 1.0 m telescope at las campanas observatory , chile . a tek ccd 2048@xmath20 detector with a pixel scale of 0.61@xmath21 was used , covering a 20.8@xmath19 square area . in most cases",
    "we have taken for each cluster a set of 3 exposures of 900 s each , allowing us to clean - up the combined images for cosmic rays . during the run",
    "seeing conditions were good to fair , namely @xmath22 = 1.4@xmath21 - 2.4@xmath21 and nights were photometric . in table",
    "[ table1 ] we list the cluster sample , their central @xmath23 and @xmath24 coordinates together with the log of observations and their radial velocity and radial velocity dispersion taken from muriel et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "images were processed following the standard recipes for bias and flat - field corrections using iraf routines . after this",
    "process sample images were carefully aligned using at least 7 stars selected from the borders and near to the center of the frames .",
    "typical accuracy of the alignment was well under a pixel .",
    "finally , aligned images were combined using a median algorithm in order to produce single r images .",
    "sky subtraction was performed by a polynomial fitting of first or second degree in specific sections of the images were no objects were present in order to avoid any kind of contamination ( see sect .",
    "[ sky ] ) .",
    "the final step was the photometric calibration that was achieved using the landolt ubvri standard star catalogue ( landolt 1992 ) .",
    "an average of four landolt star fields were observed each night at different airmasses , each field containing @xmath18 5 stars which were used for the calibration .",
    "error in zero point calibration was 0.06 mag .",
    "however , typical uncertainties of the galaxy photometry were in the range 0.06 - 0.1 mag .",
    "fainter galaxies ( @xmath25 16 ) have the largest errors and the main error source is background subtraction .    we have also fitted sky coordinates to the final r images using the plate solution computed with the iraf routine ccmap .",
    "field stars were identified using the supercosmos sky surveys .",
    "average residuals for the astrometry were all under 1@xmath21 .    in order to extract suitable galaxies for this work",
    "we have used sextractor ( source extractor ) .",
    "this routine is an automatic program that detects , classifies and performs photometry on sources from astronomical images ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) . using sextractor",
    "we have compiled the r magnitudes and positions of all galaxies from the whole cluster sample that have an apparent radius greater than 6@xmath21 .",
    "the reason for this restriction is that we aimed to minimize seeing effects on the luminosity profile fitting results ( see sect .",
    "[ seeing effects ] ) .",
    "this criteria for selecting galaxies by apparent diameter is more restrictive than the resulting limit in apparent magnitude and surface brightness . consequently",
    ", we do not expect systematic effects associated to these parameters .",
    "the analyzed final sample consist in 507 galaxies of which 232 ( 46% ) have known redshifts ( way et al . 2004 ) and only 25 of these are not cluster members . for the remaining 275 ( 54% ) galaxies we have no redshift data available .",
    "luminosity profiles were obtained using the @xmath26 routine within stsdas ( jedrezejewski 1987 ) .",
    "profiles were fitted using the standard bulge + disk law : @xmath27\\big]+i_{0}exp\\big(-\\frac{r}r_{0}\\big)\\ ] ]    in the above expression the first term corresponds to the bulge component ( de vaucouleurs 1948 ) , being @xmath28 the intensity at @xmath29 , the radius that encloses half of the total luminosity of the bulge ( also known as the effective radius ) .",
    "the second term corresponds to the disk component ( freeman , 1970 ) , being @xmath30 the central intensity and @xmath31 the length scale . for some galaxies ( 10% of the total sample )",
    "we noted that the profile was purely exponential plus a central gaussian excess .",
    "we have assumed for these galaxies that the source for the mentioned excess is an unresolved bulge and therefore we used for the profile fitting of this component the following expression :    @xmath32    in this case we were not able to calculate the bulge photometric parameters but its total luminosity .    on the other hand",
    "we have also used the srsic law ( srsic 1968 ) to fit all galaxy profiles :    @xmath33    in this equation @xmath34 is the central intensity and @xmath35 the length scale .",
    "the exponent @xmath5 is a shape parameter that describes the amount of curvature in the profile .",
    "the case @xmath36 corresponds to the de vaucouleurs law while @xmath37 corresponds to a disk profile .",
    "equation [ sersic ] is particularly useful since it needs only 3 parameters to fit the whole galaxy luminosity profile instead of the 4 required by expression [ dv+exp ] .",
    "moreover , several authors showed that srsic s @xmath5 parameter correlate very well with the luminosity , the size ( caon , capaccioli & donofrio 1993 ) and the bulge - to - disk ratio of the galaxies ( andredakis et al . 1995 ) .",
    "total luminosities of both bulge and disk components were finally computed using the derived photometric parameters and integrating separately both terms of eq .",
    "[ dv+exp ] as follows :    @xmath38    which yields : @xmath39 for the bulge component , and @xmath40 for the disk component .",
    "note that eq .",
    "[ luminosidad ] assumes that the galaxy is face on .",
    "therefore , the intensity in the eq .",
    "[ dv+exp ] and [ sersic ] were corrected by inclination as kent ( 1985 ) . on the other hand , intensity ( counts per pixel per second )",
    "was converted to surface brightness expressed in mag arcsec@xmath41 by the equation @xmath42 .",
    "units of @xmath4 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are kpc .",
    "total apparent magnitudes were then converted into absolute magnitudes as follows : for member galaxies and galaxies with unknown redshifts we calculated their absolute magnitudes using the mean cluster redshift to avoid velocity dispersion uncertainties . for those not member galaxies we determined their absolute magnitudes using their own redshifts . throughout this paper",
    "we have assumed a hubble constant @xmath45 = 70 @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 .",
    "parameters described in the above section were obtained using the @xmath49 routine within stsdas ( schombert & bothun 1987 ) .",
    "fitting procedure is only reliable on the @xmath50 portion of galaxy surface brightness profiles .",
    "every error sources , like seeing , photon noise and sky cleaning , were carefully studied in order to check the uncertainties in the computed parameters . in our case ,",
    "sky cleaning and seeing were the main error sources as well as galaxy overlapping .",
    "for the last case , we carefully masked the overlapped regions previous to the profile extraction .",
    "then with the luminosity profiles and structural parameters obtained ( center coordinates , ellipticity and position angle of the isophotes ) we constructed a test galaxy that was subtracted to the original image and the resulting image was then used to extract the luminosity profile of the remaining galaxy .",
    "the process was repeated several times ( 2 - 3 ) until the profiles converged .      in most cases",
    "a two - dimensional first - degree polynomial was sufficient to give an accurate fit to the sky .",
    "the distribution of the residuals in the frame was used to estimate the uncertainty of the sky level , @xmath51 which has a deep influence on the faint end of the luminosity profiles and therefore on the computed fitted parameters . in order to quantify this effect",
    "we have created test images where we artificially added and subtracted a constant noise equals to @xmath51 .",
    "we then extracted the new luminosity profiles as it was described in the previous section and we fitted them eq .",
    "[ dv+exp ] and [ sersic ] .",
    "this was done for several galaxies of different luminosities and sizes .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) illustrates the case for the srsic profile fitting .",
    "the galaxies have different luminosity profile shapes , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "in general terms , errors in the parameters do not correlate with the shape of the luminosity profiles .",
    "particularly , we found that the absolute error for the parameter @xmath5 is on average 0.08 .    on the other hand , measured errors for @xmath4 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 were never greater than 20% while those calculated for @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath7 were below 0.25 mag arcsec@xmath41 .",
    "there are many articles in which seeing and deconvolution effects on luminosity profiles are studied ( franx et al .",
    "1989 , saglia et al .",
    "1993 , trujillo et al . 2001 ) .",
    "however , we decided to apply a very simple analysis that allowed us to determine , in terms of seeing , which is the most adequate region of the luminosity profile to perform the fitting procedure .",
    "in other words , we determined the minimum radius of the luminosity profile we can use for the fit in order to recover the true photometric parameters of a galaxy . to achieve this goal",
    "we have generated model images of several galaxies with different photometric parameters , luminosities and sizes .",
    "these images were then convolved with a set of gaussian filters prior to the luminosity profile extraction .",
    "finally we fitted eq .",
    "[ dv+exp ] and [ sersic ] to the obtained profiles in different semi - major axis regions .",
    "two examples of our results are illustrated in figure [ fig2 ] ( a ) and ( b ) , and the obtained photometric parameters are listed in table [ table2 ] .",
    "these cases consider two galaxies with different luminosities , @xmath57 = 13.65 ( galaxy 1 ) and @xmath58 = 16.50 ( galaxy 2 ) , and different profile shapes @xmath59 and @xmath60 . selected values for the fwhm of the gaussian filters were chosen to simulate the seeing conditions of the observing run , 1.0 @xmath21 @xmath61 fwhm @xmath61 2.4 @xmath21 .",
    "we conclude that the more suitable region for profile fitting is that for @xmath62 beyond 1.5 fwhm . with this restriction ,",
    "obtained parameters have associated errors that are well below those calculated in the previous section .",
    "table [ table2 ] shows this effect . note that for galaxy 1 ( apparent radius at 1 @xmath51 detection @xmath18 12 fwhm ) , obtained parameters are in reasonably agreement with the original ones even when we consider the whole luminosity profile for the fitting .",
    "however , this is not true for galaxy 2 that has an apparent radius @xmath18 4.5 fwhm . in this case",
    ", the obtained parameters strongly depend on the interval considered and the best results are obtained by fitting data beyond 1.5 fwhm .",
    "most extreme cases are those for the galaxies with an apparent radius similar to 3 fwhm . for such cases",
    ", we could not recover the original photometric parameters since seeing mostly affects the shape of the whole luminosity profile .",
    "for this reason we decided to include in our analysis only galaxies with an apparent radius greater than 3@xmath22 or @xmath63 .",
    "the derived photometric and structural parameters for the bulge and disk components are collected in table [ table3 ] .",
    "galaxies are identified through their parent abell number and their individual @xmath23 and @xmath24 coordinates . in this table @xmath64 , @xmath65 and",
    "@xmath66 expressed in mag arcsec@xmath41 .",
    "table [ table3 ] also lists the total absolute magnitudes for the galaxies as well as the total magnitudes for bulges and disks for those galaxies where profile decomposition was possible .    from the total 507 analyzed galaxies",
    ", we found that 162 ( 32% ) have pure @xmath2 profiles , 168 ( 33% ) have pure exponential profiles and 93 ( 18% ) are well fitted by a combination of both .",
    "we also found 84 ( 17% ) galaxies with luminosity profiles that could not be fitted with the classical bulge + disk decomposition .",
    "for such cases we have only used the srsic law .",
    "in addition , we have also fitted the srsic law to the total sample .",
    "figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] illustrate the cases described above .      the study of correlation between the photometric parameters is a good tool to understand the structure of galaxies and their evolution .",
    "many scaling relations have been discovered for galaxies , such as the fundamental plane ( djorgovski & davis 1987 , dressler et al .",
    "1987 ) for elliptical galaxies and the tully - fisher ( 1977 ) relation for spirals . in the absence of spectroscopic measurements of the velocity dispersion",
    ", one can study the projection of the fundamental plane which is purely photometric .",
    "this plane is defined by the effective radius @xmath4 and the surface brightness @xmath55 , known as kormendy relation ( kormendy 1977 ) : @xmath67 .",
    "we show this relation in figure [ fig5 ] ( a ) and we find a slope value @xmath683.62@xmath690.09 .",
    "all slopes and zero points determined in this work correspond to the bisector fit of two ordinary least - squares regressions of @xmath70 vs @xmath71 and @xmath71 vs @xmath70 as described by isobe et al .",
    "our results are in good agreement with those derived by la barbera et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for abell 2163 .",
    "although there are other published results ( ziegler et al .",
    "1999 , andredakis et al .",
    "1995 and mllenhoff & heidt 2001 ) they correspond to studies in other photometric bands .",
    "we have also studied the @xmath72 relation for disks which is analogous to that of bulges . however",
    ", this relation shows a larger scatter than the @xmath73 relation , see figure [ fig5 ] ( b ) . in this case",
    "we find a slope value @xmath74 .    in order to compare bulge and disk relations we also determined the effective surface brightness and the effective radius of the disks , as in mllenhoff & heidt ( 2001 ) .",
    "results are plotted in figure [ fig6 ] where we can observe a similar relation for both subsystems : @xmath75 .",
    "the same relation was previously obtained by mllenhoff & heidt ( 2001 ) for field spiral galaxies .",
    "the results agree with the idea that bulges and disks are virialized systems having similar mass - to - light ratio ( bender et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "we have also analyzed the magnitude - size relation @xmath76 for bulges ( which is closely related to the kormendy relation ) , and the @xmath77 relation for disks .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows these relations where we plot in two different diagrams galaxies with @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "this choice relies on the fact that we observe that luminosity profiles with @xmath79 could also be well fitted with the typical bulge + disk function . in the same way we have considered disks with @xmath80 and @xmath81 since those galaxies with @xmath81 do not show a bulge component .",
    "however , we found that the relations for each component are independent of the value of @xmath5 with @xmath82 for bulges , and @xmath83 for disks .",
    "our results for disks are in good agreement with those found by thomas ( 2002 ) , who uses galaxies from enacs to study the magnitude - size relations .",
    "this author found that the slopes of these relations are not significantly different for different morphologies , so he adopted a single slope ( -4.5 ) for bulges as well as for disks ( -4.3 ) .",
    "however , in our case bulges show a greater value than that calculated by thomas ( 2002 ) .    we have also studied galaxy total magnitudes and their dependence on bulge and disk properties .",
    "figures [ fig8 ] ( a ) and ( b ) show @xmath84 versus @xmath85 and @xmath84 versus @xmath86 relations .",
    "as expected , galaxies with larger bulges and larger disks have higher total luminosity although a large dispersion can be appreciated .",
    "we have described several photometric relations for galaxies of different morphological types .",
    "in particular , we found a similar relation between the structural parameters @xmath4 , @xmath43 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and the total luminosity of the galaxies and their components .",
    "these observed relations contain information about the physical processes that drove their formation and evolution .",
    "lima neto , gerbal & mrquez ( 1999 ) found that elliptical galaxies have a quasi - constant specific entropy . on the other hand , mrquez et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have studied scaling relations between potential energy and mass , and they explain the origin of several observed photometric relations .",
    "they found that the theoretical slope of the @xmath87 relation ( which is related to the @xmath73 relation ) , depends only on the slope of the scaling relation between the mass and the potential energy of a galaxy .",
    "although this result applies only to elliptical galaxies , it is interesting to note that our sample of disk galaxies obeys a similar relation .",
    "we have also investigated the correlation between the shape parameter @xmath5 and the total luminosity . using dwarf",
    "elliptical galaxies young & currie ( 1994 ) have proposed this relation as a distance indicator .",
    "they used a small sample of galaxies in the fornax cluster and found a tight @xmath88 relation .",
    "we plot the @xmath89 relation for the total sample in figure [ fig9 ] where a clear trend can be appreciated although with a large dispersion that precludes precise distance estimates .",
    "however , since our sample includes all type of giant galaxies the observed large dispersion has most likely a different physical origin than the results derived from early - type dwarf galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig10 ] shows the correlation between the parameters corresponding to the srsic profile .",
    "as we can observe none of these relationships show a linear behavior . for our case the best empirical fitting form for",
    "the @xmath7 - @xmath44 relation is ( panel b ) :    @xmath90    while for the @xmath91 relation ( see in panel b ) is :    @xmath92    finally in panel ( c ) we can observe the @xmath93 relation and our best fitting is :    @xmath94    mrquez et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have demonstrated that the specific entropy and scaling relation between potential energy and mass constrains the distribution of gravitational matter in elliptical galaxies .",

    ", these authors obtain the _ entropic surface _ expressed in terms of the srsic parameters . in addition , they use the scaling relation between potential energy and mass to obtain the _ energy - mass surface_. the intersection line of these two surfaces in the @xmath95 $ ] space , called the _ entropy - energy line _ , is the only locus along which elliptical galaxies can be found . in other words ,",
    "elliptical galaxies are indeed a one - parameter family . according to our analysis , not only ellipticals , but all galaxies in the sample lie along this locus .",
    "this behavior is shown in figure [ fig11 ] .",
    "we also notice that the upper limit of the observed @xmath44 parameter is @xmath96 , in good agreement with the data and model predictions of mrquez et al .",
    "we have obtained the luminosity profiles of 507 galaxies in 14 nearby clusters of the sars survey ( way et al .",
    "we fitted de vaucouleurs law for the bulge component and an exponential law for the disk component .",
    "we also fitted srsic s law for all galaxies of our sample .",
    "we have studied error sources in the photometry like seeing , photon noise and sky cleaning in order to check the uncertainties in the computed parameters .",
    "particularly , sky cleaning , seeing and galaxy overlapping were the main error sources in our case . on the other hand",
    ", sky level has a deep influence on the faint end of the luminosity profiles and therefore , on most of the parameters of the luminosity profiles .",

    "finally , we analyzed how seeing affects these parameters and we determined the optimum radius range that minimizes seeing effects on the fitting parameters .",
    "for this reason , we have only included in the present analysis those galaxies with an apparent radius greater than 3@xmath22 equivalent to an apparent radius @xmath97 6@xmath21 .",
    "the correlation of structural and photometric parameters of bulges and disks show consistency with a unique relation in the @xmath3 plane .",
    "as expected , we also found that bulges and disks obey a magnitude - size relation in the sense that large bulges and disks ( large @xmath4 values ) have high luminosities .",
    "the derived @xmath98 relation is consistent with thomas ( 2002 ) , although the @xmath76 relation is less steep than that obtained by this author .",
    "we find that these magnitude - size relations do not depend on the srsic fit shape parameter @xmath5 indicating that early - type galaxies and bulges of spirals show a similar behavior .",
    "we investigated the relation between the @xmath5 parameter and the absolute magnitude finding a weak linear trend . on the other hand , srsic law",
    "fitting parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 show a strong correlation in agreement with the theoretical analysis made by mrquez et al .",
