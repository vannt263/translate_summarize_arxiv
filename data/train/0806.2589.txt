    "collective or chemical diffusion of adsorbed species describes diffusion of the local density of many particle system involving individual jumps from one binding site to another .",
    "diffusion is an important process that controls many physical phenomena as building of nanostructures , crystal growth or rate of chemical reactions .",
    "analysis of such processes quite often assumes collective diffusion as if particles were independent of each other .",
    "such an approach , although reasonable as a first approximation , can give quite misleading results if a more precise answer is needed .",
    "from a perspective of a theorist collective diffusion is a complicated many ",
    "body problem of diffusion to which a variety of approaches are being applied ranging from analytic ones based on master , fokker ",
    "planck , or kramers equations to numerical monte carlo or molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "an important background is provided by the works of reed and ehrlich@xcite , an early summary by gomer@xcite , and recent reviews by danani _",
    "et al._@xcite and by ala - nissila _ et al._@xcite .",
    "relevant analytic results for some generic simple models were collected by haus and kehr@xcite and interrelations between different statistical descriptions of these processes have been reviewed by allnatt and lidiard@xcite .",
    "our interest is the coverage dependence of the collective diffusion coefficient in a two - dimensional kinetic lattice gas model .",
    "most of the activity in this field has been dedicated to interacting gases on homogeneous substrates with different geometries .",
    "one of the earliest seems to be a linear response theory approach by zwerger@xcite which allowed to derive analytic expressions for the coverage dependent collective diffusion coefficient , @xmath0 , for a 1d lattice gas with nn and nnn interactions .",
    "kreuzer and his collaborators , using a version of the kinetic lattice gas model which he developed earlier to study thermal desorption kinetics@xcite , investigated @xmath1 ( with @xmath2 being temperature ) in a 1d and 2d lattice gas on nonhomogeneous substrate with nn interactions and different models of microscopic kinetics@xcite .    in this work",
    "we discuss 2d systems in which interactions are limited to the site blocking only , but the local site potential energy landscape changes from site to site within one lattice elementary cell , i.e. the underlying substrate is nonhomogeneous . the collective diffusion in such a system is a complicated and difficult for an analytical treatment problem .",

    "@xcite and theoretical mean field analysis of these results based on approach balancing of nonequlibrium particle fluxes were presented by chvoj at al @xcite we have shown recently in ref . that the variational approach to collective diffusion , proposed in a series of earlier works@xcite , provides a very efficient and systematic method of analyzing diffusion in nonhomogeneous 1d systems . in this work",
    "we extend the results of ref . to two - dimensional systems .",
    "it appears that the diffusion is not a simple product of one - dimensional projections in two main directions of the lattice .",
    "whereas the diffusion coefficient of a single particle over such a lattice always factorizes so the diffusion coefficients in both directions can be calculated independently , in a many particle system the site blocking induces dynamical correlations between jumps in different directions .",
    "properly selected variational parameters allow to obtain the expression for the collective diffusion coefficient which contains all possible jump rates present in the model .",
    "when the rate of jumps in one direction increases from zero to infinity , the formula describing diffusion coefficient evolves from the one characteristic for a one - dimensional system @xcite to the 2d mean field theory result , known from refs . .",
    "we show that our variational approach works very well in the described cases by comparing analytical results with the monte carlo data .",

    "we treat diffusion within the adsorbate using a kinetic lattice gas model .",
    "basic assumptions are standard : kinetics of the microstates of the lattice gas is due to the stochastic hopping of particles to neighbouring sites , only one particle in the gas hops at any given instant , an average residence time of particles at the adsorption sites is much longer than the transit time between the sites , the transition rates of these hops depend on the potential energy landscape experienced by the hopping particle .",
    "double occupancy is forbidden , particles jump between neighboring sites with transition rates that depend on the initial and final states .",

    "the rate depends only on the local potential energy landscape experienced by the hopping particle",
    ". for thermally activated jumps it depends on the difference between the potential energy of the particle at the top of the potential energy barrier between the sites involved and that at the initial site .         in order to investigate how the collective diffusion coefficient in a given direction is controlled by the particle jumps and the geometry of the lattice in the direction perpendicular to it we analyze diffusion over two types of two - dimensional lattices , shown in fig .",

    "it receives two additional distinct contributions @xmath59 and @xmath60 which play a role of the variational parameters allowing to minimize @xmath61 .",

    "it is always possible to select one particular site ( the same within each unit cell ) which , if occupied , contributes the geometrical phase @xmath64 .",
    "the other phase , @xmath65 , called the _ correlational phase _ , is introduced to account for correlations between the @xmath30th particle and all the remaining ones and , in principle , it depends on the state of occupation of all sites in the system . following previous work @xcite we assume that it is sensitive to the occupation of sites nearest to @xmath66 only .",

    "the increase of the diffusion with decreasing parameter @xmath117 does not lead to a singular behavior as @xmath137 . comparing fig .",

    "4 we can see evident qualitative difference in the behavior of both systems .",
    "this difference was not so clearly seen in fig .",

    "in order to verify our analytical results for the behavior of the diffusing gas on the nonhomogeneous two - dimensional surfaces we have simulated such systems by using monte carlo dynamical approach . we have used boltzmann - matano analysis of the shape of step - like density profile , after letting it decay via diffusion process @xcite .",
    "results of this analysis are shown in fig .",
    "comparison for two different jump rates along @xmath15direction are shown .",
    "these rates have been chosen in such a way that @xmath138 , so the analytic results merge at @xmath121 . in the right panel of fig .",
    "5 we see system with the same jump rates in both @xmath14- and @xmath15directions . the highest diffusion coefficient is two times larger than the lowest one .",
    "the same difference can be seen for the monte carlo data , even if noise of the results is large . if we increase rate of jumps along @xmath15direction by a factor of ten , then the expected ratio of the highest and the lowest diffusion coefficient increases to four(left panel ) .",
    "this trend is confirmed by simulations shown in the left panel . unfortunately due to the high level of noise the difference in the behavior between the two types of analyzed lattices is not clearly visible in the simulation results .",
    "however , it is evident that the behavior of the diffusion coefficient as a function of the density changes with the increasing rate of jumps along @xmath15axis in both cases in the manner consistent with our analytical results .",
    "we have shown that the recently formulated variational approach to the collective diffusion is an effective and promising method of calculation of the diffusion coefficient in two - dimensional systems . here , we have used this method to describe behavior of a system of particles on a nonhomogeneous potential landscape .",
    "the resulting density dependence of the collective diffusion coefficient as a function of all rates that are present in the system is given by a simple analytic formula .",
    "this dependence agrees with monte carlo simulation results obtained for selected systems .",
    "we show that dynamical behavior of two - dimensional system is interesting and far from trivial even if site blocking is the only interaction that particles experience .",
    "it appears that in contrast to a single particle system , collective diffusion in @xmath14- and @xmath15directions of a system of particles depend on each other in the sense that the diffusion coefficient along one direction strongly depends on the rate jumps of particle in the direction perpendicular to it .",
    "this effect is induced by the site blocking , because it is not present in the system of many independently moving particles we have demonstrated that the one - dimensional character of diffusion changes continuously when the rates of jumps are varied in direction perpendicular to the one along which diffusion is observed .",
    "we can understand this as a result of an activation of alternative diffusion pathways , when the direct pathway is blocked .",
    "the transition from the one to two dimensional behavior is highly nontrivial even if particles do not interact .",

    "<S> collective diffusion coefficient in a two - dimensional lattice gas on a nonhomogeneous substrate is investigated using variational approach . </S>",
    "<S> particles reside at adsorption sites with different well depths potentials and jump randomly between them . </S>",
    "<S> the site blocking is the only particle  particle interaction mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the value of the diffusion coefficient in one lattice direction depends nontrivially on the rate and the character of the particle jumps in all directions . when the jump rate in the direction perpendicular to that along which the diffusion is observed increases , the collective diffusion coefficient approaches values predicted within the mean field approximation . </S>",
    "<S> results of the monte carlo simulations for selected systems are very well reproduced by our analytical results . </S>"
