    "supersymmetry is up to now one of the most attractive theories beyond the standardmodel ( sm ) .",
    "but from the theoretical point of view there exist many ways for a supersymmetric extension of the sm .",
    "one of the widely used models is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) that has minimal content in the higgs sector .",
    "the masses , mixings and couplings of the four neutralinos are determined by the parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the minimal extension of the mssm by a higgs singlet field @xmath9 is the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @xcite .",
    "the neutralino sector now contains five neutralinos being mixtures of the mssm gauginos and higgsinos and an additional singlino @xmath10 . the nmssm neutralino mixing depends on the parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath8 , the singlet vacuum expectation value @xmath11 and the trilinear couplings @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite . for large values of @xmath11 the singlino dominated neutralino decouples and the remaining four neutralinos",
    "have the same masses and characters as in the mssm if one identifies @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the linear collider ( lc ) will first run in the @xmath15-mode .",
    "however , associated neutralino production @xmath16 may not give sufficient evidence for a discrimination between mssm and nmssm , especially if this is the only kinematical accesible neutralino production process in the @xmath15-mode .",
    "in our contribution we want to investigate the possibilities to distinguish between the models with the help of @xmath0 scattering @xmath2 .",
    "we first study the associated production of left / right selectrons and the lightest neutralino ( lsp ) in @xmath0 scattering .",
    "the high energetic photon comes from compton back - scattering of laser photons off one electron beam at a lc .",
    "the production proceeds via s - channel exchange of an electron and t - channel exchange of selectrons .",
    "the formulas for special cases are given in @xcite , the complete analytical expressions for the differential and total cross sections for polarized beams will be given in a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "the subsequent decay of the selectrons in electrons and the lsp leads to an @xmath18 and missing energy in the final state .",
    "the total cross section for the production and decay in the @xmath19-cms depends on the polarisation @xmath20 of the electron beam , the helicity @xmath21 of the laser photon and the helicity @xmath22 of the converted electron beam .    in fig .  1 we show the contours of constant total cross sections for the process @xmath23 in the @xmath6-@xmath7-plane for the mssm and the @xmath6-@xmath11-plane for the nmssm for @xmath24 gev .",
    "for the calculations we choose the longitudinal polarisation of the electron beam @xmath25 , the helicity of the converted electron beam @xmath26 and the helicity of the laser photon @xmath27 .",
    "this set of polarisations can be achieved at tesla and leads to the most significant contours .",
    "we set @xmath28 , the common scalar mass @xmath29 gev and use the gut relation @xmath30 .",
    "the trilinear couplings are choosen as @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( fig .",
    "1b ) , @xmath31 and @xmath33 ( fig .",
    "1c ) and @xmath34 and @xmath33 ( fig .",
    "1d ) .    if in the nmssm the @xmath3 is dominated by the singlino content the production is supressed , because electron and selectron only couple to the gaugino components of the neutralino",
    ". then the total cross section is smaller than 1 fb in some parameter regions ( fig .",
    "1b - d ) and probably lies below the detection limit of a @xmath0 collider .",
    "otherwise one obtains cross sections similar to the mssm . for @xmath35",
    "there also exist a small band with 1 fb @xmath36 10 fb ( fig .",
    "1c / d ) . in this region",
    "the @xmath3 is the mainly singlino - like , but nevertheless it will be very difficult to extract this small signal from the background @xmath37 @xcite .",

    "in this section we consider two cases : ( a ) @xmath3 has singlino character and @xmath38 corresponds to @xmath39 ; ( b ) @xmath40 is singlino dominated and @xmath3 is similar in nmssm and mssm . in table 1",
    "we present four reference scenarios i , ii ( a ) and iii , iv ( b ) with fixed @xmath41 and @xmath42 for comparison . in all scenarios the lightest mssm - like neutralino",
    "is dominated by gaugino components , which couple to electrons and selectrons , while the higgsino components do not . for @xmath43 and @xmath44 ,",
    "the only channel for direct production of neutralinos in @xmath15 annihilation is @xmath45 .",
    "however , if one of the neutralinos is mainly singlino this process will be suppressed .",
    "the cross sections for the process @xmath45 in fig .",
    "2a are calculated with longitudinal polarisations @xmath46 of the electron beam and @xmath47 of the positron beam .",
    "2b / c shows the cross sections for @xmath48 with polarisations @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the reference scenarios . in all scenarios",

    "the smaller cross section in scenario ii is due to the different relative signs of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which leads to cancellations in the interference terms @xcite .",
    "now it will be a question of luminosity and background supression , whether the cross sections are measurable .",
    "even if a signal is detected , the decision whether @xmath3 or @xmath40 is the singlino dominated neutralino will be difficult since the cross sections are very similar ( @xmath52 fb in scenario i and @xmath54 fb in scenario iii , see fig .",

    "scattering the process @xmath55 will be strongly supressed ( see sec .  1 ) .",
    "then the first detectable neutralino production process at a high luminosity collider will be @xmath56 .",
    "2c shows total cross sections of @xmath57 fb in scenarios i and ii at @xmath24 gev which further increase for higher energies .",
    "this process , however , will lead to a completely different final state compared to the lsp - selectron production because of the additional decay of the @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "therefore one can decide via detection of the @xmath0 process that the @xmath3 is mainly singlino .",
    "if the @xmath15 cross section is too small for detection , the production and decay of @xmath40 together with @xmath58 in @xmath0 will be the first direct production process of neutralinos that would be measurable at @xmath24 gev with high luminosity .",
    "the non - detection of the @xmath59 production suggests a singlino - like @xmath3 and therefore extended supersymmetry as the underlying theory .",

    "iv one obtains @xmath61 fb for @xmath24 gev ( fig .",
    "if , however , the cross section for associated neutralino production in @xmath15 annihilation can not be observed , the process @xmath55 would be the first process for direct production of neutralinos .",
    "but this process alone does not aalow to discriminate between the mssm and the nmssm .",
