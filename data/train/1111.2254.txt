    "again , no conclusive evidence was found for the presence of c@xmath0 in space .",
    "more recently , @xcite analyzed the 1520 @xmath4 m spectrum of the reflection nebula ngc  7023 obtained with the infrared spectrograph ( irs , * ? ? ? * ) on board the spitzer space telescope @xcite .",

    "a representation of a c@xmath0 molecule is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : structure ] .",
    "the 60 carbon atoms are arranged in the shape of a truncated icosahedron ( @xmath5 symmetry ) : a hollow sphere that is made of 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons .",
    "c@xmath0 has 174 vibrational modes , but owing to its symmetry , many modes are degenerate and only 4 distinct modes are ir active : the @xmath6 mode at 18.9 @xmath4 m ; the @xmath7 mode at 17.4 @xmath4 m ; the @xmath8 mode at 8.5 @xmath4 m and the @xmath9 mode at 7.0 @xmath4 m .",
    "laboratory experiments have measured the frequencies of these transitions in the pure , solid state @xcite as well as in the gas - phase @xcite . in those experiments ,",
    "the measured bands are fairly broad and symmetric , and thus well characterized by a central wavelength and a width .",
    "the differences between the measured frequencies primarily reflect the effect of temperature : a higher temperature shifts the bands to lower frequencies and causes broadening @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic strength of the c@xmath0 bands is less well known , and the literature offers quite different values for the absorption coefficients ( even relative to one another ) , obtained either from laboratory experiments or theoretical calculations .",
    "@xcite used data from @xcite ; for the analysis of ngc  7023 by @xcite , strengths from @xcite were used .",
    "also @xcite presented molar absorptivities derived from laboratory experiments .",
    "whereas the model for the c@xmath0 geometry has traditionally been a soccer ball , the c@xmath1 molecule is a prolate top more like a rugby ball .",
    "the lower symmetry ( d@xmath10 ) results in more ir active modes : of the 204 fundamental vibrational modes , 31 are ir active , and laboratory studies as well as theoretical dft calculations are available @xcite .",
    "most of the c@xmath1 ir active bands are weak , and furthermore blend with the c@xmath0 bands ; but several isolated bands of medium strength are at 14.8 , 21.8 , 12.6 and 15.6 @xmath4 m .",
    "@xcite reported the identification of the ir c@xmath0 bands in the unusual spitzer - irs spectrum of the planetary nebula ( pn ) tc  1 .",
    "the high quality of the spectrum and the lack of contaminating features make this source the clearest case for the presence of fullerenes in space .",
    "[ fig : tc1spec ] shows the continuum - subtracted spitzer - irs observations of the planetary nebula tc  1 .",
    "apart from the strong ( typically forbidden ) emission lines that are characteristic for pne , the spectrum is very unusual , and exhibits clear emission bands at the wavelengths of all four fundamental modes of c@xmath0 m is due to an [ arii ] line . ] .",
    "weaker and narrower features are present at the wavelengths of the strongest ( unblended ) c@xmath1 bands .",
    "in addition to the fullerene bands , a broad underlying plateau is evident between 69 @xmath4 m , as is a broad emission feature at 11.5 @xmath4 m that is generally attributed to sic @xcite .",
    "there is not much else left in the spectrum though , and thus little contamination confuses the analysis of the fullerene spectral features .    as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ sect : specprop ] , the experimentally obtained central wavelengths and band widths for the c@xmath0 bands depend on the temperature , and thus a comparison with laboratory data requires some estimate of a typical temperature for the fullerenes in tc  1 .",
    "surprisingly , the observed band strengths for both c@xmath0 and c@xmath1 are consistent with a thermal population distribution over the vibrational levels ( see sect .  [",
    "sect : excitation ] ) . for c@xmath0 , we can thus derive an excitation temperature of 332  k ; for c@xmath1 the derived temperature is 179  k. all other measurable quantities are consistent with such a temperature .",
    "indeed , the central wavelengths of all c@xmath0 emission bands in the spectrum of tc  1 correspond especially well to experimental values measured at @xmath2300  k ( rather than values measured at e.g. 1000  k ) .",
    "further support comes from the band widths : laboratory spectra show temperature - dependent widths ( fwhm ) from about 8 @xmath11 at 300  k to 13 @xmath11 at 1000  k @xcite for both the 17.4 and 18.9 @xmath4 m c@xmath0 bands . for tc  1 , the measured band widths are 9.9 and 12.6 @xmath11 for the bands at 18.9 and 17.4 @xmath4 m respectively , but since both bands suffer from contamination by the c@xmath1 bands , their true band widths are necessarily smaller , and thus only compatible with the lower temperature regime .",
    "the c@xmath0 bands at 7.0 and 8.5 @xmath4 m are not resolved and thus offer no such information .",
    "also the central wavelengths of the four isolated c@xmath1 features compare better to the frequencies measured at low temperatures .    summarizing",
    ", we can conclude that the spectrum of tc  1 shows the clear spectral fingerprint of the fullerene species c@xmath0 and c@xmath1 , and that all measurable quantities ( wavelengths , widths and band ratios ) are consistent with laboratory experiments at temperatures of a few hundred k.      with the clean fullerene spectrum of tc  1 as a template , the presence of c@xmath0 has been confirmed in the circumstellar environments of a variety of evolved objects .",
    "@xcite found the c@xmath0 bands in several other carbon - rich pne . in most cases ,",
    "the spectra are contaminated by pah features , thus complicating the analysis ; a notable exception is the pn smp  smc  16 in the small magellanic cloud that looks quite similar to tc  1 .",
    "no conclusive confirmation of the weaker c@xmath1 features has been reported in these objects though . at first , these detections suggested fullerenes form in the pn phase .",
    "however , they are already present in at least one proto - pn object @xcite , and the c@xmath0 bands are also seen in the spitzer - irs spectra of a few post - agb stars @xcite .    in the search for fullerenes in space ,",
    "special attention was given to the r coronae borealis ( rcb ) stars , a class of hydrogen - poor and helium - rich supergiants .",
    "under typical conditions in circumstellar environments , the presence of hydrogen inhibits the formation of fullerenes ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : formation ] ) , and thus the hydrogen - poor nature of the circumstellar environments of rcb stars was considered ideal to form c@xmath0 . the first search for c@xmath0 in such environments",
    "did not turn up any evidence for fullerenes @xcite .",
    "more recently , c@xmath0 has been detected in two rcb stars that were studied with the spitzer space telescope @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , those two objects represent the most h - rich objects in a larger sample of rcb stars . in another study ,",
    "an additional detection was made in one more rcb star @xcite .",
    "the spectral features of c@xmath0 have also been detected in interstellar environments  in the two reflection nebulae ngc 7023 and ngc 2023 @xcite , and also in the orion bar @xcite .",
    "these sources are spatially resolved , and @xcite showed that in ngc  7023 , the peak emission of pahs originates from a different location as the peak emission from c@xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ngc7023:c60 ] ) .",
    "this has some implications for the formation and excitation of fullerenes ( see sect .  [",
    "sect : excitation ] and [ sect : formation ] ) .",
    "with the presence of fullerenes in space firmly established , an important question to address is what fraction of the cosmic carbon they represent , and different methods have been applied to estimate the fullerene abundances . in the evolved stars , of the order of 0.061.5 % of the available carbon is estimated to be in the form of c@xmath0 @xcite . for ngc  7023 on the other hand , @xcite find that 0.10.6% of the interstellar carbon is in c@xmath0 .",
    "this latter is compatible with earlier estimates of 0.30.9% of the cosmic carbon that was estimated to be in the form of c@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to see that the abundance estimates in the evolved objects are comparable to the interstellar fullerene abundances .",
    "if only a fraction of the carbon - rich evolved stars would produce fullerenes , one would expect the interstellar abundances to be much lower than the circumstellar abundances in individual objects .",
    "if the derived abundances are realistic , this then implies that the formation of fullerenes must be fairly common . in any case",
    ", the derived abundances represent a significant fraction of the cosmic carbon for a single molecular species .",
    "the presence of c@xmath0 in diverse evolved objects suggests that fullerenes form in circumstellar outflows whenever conditions are right , and the detection of fullerenes in interstellar environments is then a testimony to the stability of these species that allows them to survive the harsh conditions in the ism . in very general terms , the available observational data on the fullerenes thus confirm the early suggestion by @xcite : fullerenes form in carbon - rich circumstellar environments , and survive and thrive in the interstellar medium .",
    "having identified several emission bands with a specific molecular carrier offers the prospect of using these spectral features as a diagnostic tool to extract quantitative information about the physical conditions that reign in the environment in which they reside . precisely what information can be obtained depends somewhat on the molecules excitation mechanism at play .",
    "large , free molecules such as fullerenes and pahs are generally thought to be excited by the absorption of a single photon ( typically in the uv range ) .",
    "rapid internal conversion then leaves the molecule in the electronic ground state , but in highly excited vibrational states ; and as the molecule relaxes , it emits ir photons . for all relevant processes pertaining to the excitation & cooling mechanism , fullerenes have indeed very similar properties to pahs ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite analyzed the c@xmath0 in ngc  7023 using such an excitation model .",
    "the resulting emission spectrum of this fluorescent cooling process can be calculated in various ways ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the only free parameter in these calculations is the average photon energy that is absorbed by the molecules  which is a function of the ambient radiation field and the absorption cross section of the molecule in question .",
    "[ fig : cascademodels ] shows a few examples of how the resulting ir spectra change following absorption of photons with different energies .",
    "note how there is little change in the ratio between the 17.4 @xmath4 m band and the 18.9 @xmath4 m band for the energies considered here . for typical pne conditions ( @xmath12 7 ev )",
    "however , the bands at 7.0 and 8.5 @xmath4 m should be fairly strong , and the band ratios @xmath13 and @xmath14 could in principle be used as a sensitive measure of the average photon energy .",
    "however , the numerical values for the band ratios depend on the intrinsic band strengths used in the calculations ; as mentioned in sect .  [ sect : specprop ] , these are not well known , and different values are available in the literature . using the intensities as given by @xcite ( as was done for the analysis of the c@xmath0 bands in the reflection nebula ngc  7023 presented by @xcite )",
    ", the @xmath15 band ratio should be roughly constant at about 0.28 for photon energies relevant to pne environments .",
    "the measured band ratio in tc  1 however is 0.59 ; when accounting for the contamination by c@xmath1 the ratio is somewhat lower , but can never be brought in agreement with the expected ratio for fluorescent emission when adopting these intrinsic strengths .",
    "the 8.5/18.9 @xmath4 m band ratio on the other hand is too low to be consistent with the same fluorescent cooling model .",
    "one could argue that the adopted intensities for the bands are not correct , but also the other observations of the c@xmath0 bands pose difficulties in the framework of fluorescence .",
    "for all detected sources , the band ratios ( including @xmath15 ) show significant variations from source to source ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is also evident from the different excitation temperatures ( @xmath2200700  k ) that are derived assuming a thermal distribution over the vibrational bands . in many cases ,",
    "the bands are contaminated by pah features , but it is not clear if that alone can explain all the observed spectral variations .",
    "if true , these variations ( and especially the @xmath15 band ratio ) are not compatible with fluorescent cooling , irrespective of the intrinsic strength values used .",
    "the fairly clean fullerene spectrum of tc  1 offers the possibility of directly calculating the population distribution over the excited vibrational states from the total emitted power in the bands ; and this can be done for both c@xmath0 and c@xmath1 .",
    "surprisingly , the population distribution is fully consistent with a thermal distribution ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : thermalstuff ] ) over the vibrational states corresponding to an excitation temperature of 332  k for c@xmath0 , and 179  k for c@xmath1 .",
    "thermal models show quite different spectral variations as a function of temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig : thermalstuff ] ) compared to the fluorescent cooling models and can more easily accommodate some of the observed changes in the @xmath15 band ratios .",
    "the cases where the 7.0 and 8.5 @xmath4 m band are missing would then correspond to excitation temperatures @xmath16 , whereas an unacceptably low photon energy would be required in the fluorescence model .",
    "it is not easy to understand how free c@xmath0 molecules in circumstellar or interstellar environments could produce an emission spectrum that is consistent with thermal excitation rather than with stochastic heating and fluorescent cooling . since gas densities are typically orders of magnitude lower than the critical density , it is unlikely that gas collisions could keep the fullerenes thermalized .",
    "it was thus proposed that the fullerene molecules are not free , but in direct contact with the surface of dust grains , or in the solid state themselves @xcite .",
    "in such a case , the fullerenes would be in equilibrium with the dust grains , which themselves are in equilibrium with the ambient radiation field .",
    "however , the derived excitation temperatures are hard to understand in this scenario .",
    "further observations and analyses will be required to settle the excitation mechanism conclusively .",
    "from the fairly large number of evolved objects in which the c@xmath0 bands have been detected , it seems clear that these species do indeed form in the circumstellar environments of evolved stars .",
    "precisely how this happens is far less clear though , and there has been some discussion about the precise pathways to fullerene formation .    in this context",
    ", it is worthwhile to consider what we know from laboratory experiments . in the original experiments by @xcite ,",
    "fullerenes self - assemble from much smaller carbon fragments by collisions . at very low gas densities , a broad distribution of cluster sizes",
    "is observed ; but as the gas density is increased , collisions become more numerous , and only the most stable species ( c@xmath0 ) survives .",
    "if in carbon - rich circumstellar environments , collisional processes ( occurring under the similar conditions ) are driving the chemistry , fullerenes could form in the same way .",
    "the efficiency of the fullerene formation process is then a function of the density .",
    "however , an important condition in this formation process is the absence of hydrogen .",
    "it has long been realized that the presence of h will inhibit the formation of fullerenes ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . indeed",
    ", laboratory experiments show that the mere presence of hydrogen ( as little as 0.4% ) in such conditions already greatly reduces fullerene formation . at a hydrogen fraction of 10% ,",
    "no fullerenes are formed anymore , and the experiments result in large amounts of pahs instead @xcite .",
    "based on the spitzer - irs spectrum of tc  1 alone , it would seem that its circumstellar environment is fairly analogous to this laboratory setup .",
    "indeed , the available material is clearly carbon - rich , while at the same time , the fullerene - rich ir spectrum does not show much evidence for the presence of pahs nor any other h - containing species .",
    "it is thus conceivable that the region where the fullerenes are located is hydrogen - poor .",
    "however , it is clear that h is present at large in the nebula ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and even in the photosphere of the central star . thus , if the formation of fullerenes in tc  1 involves collisional growth of carbon clusters under similar conditions as in the laboratory experiments , there must have been h - poor regions in the nebula to allow the fullerenes to form .",
    "@xcite argue against a formation scenario in which a h - poor environment is required .",
    "they note that in their pne data , the spitzer - irs spectra show the simultaneous presence of the c@xmath0 features and pahs . from this , they conclude that both species co - exist , and that the fullerenes form at the same time and place as pahs , in a h - rich environment .",
    "they propose photo - processing of solid hydrogenated amorphous carbon ( hac ) as the most plausible fullerene formation route in pne environments .",
    "support for that assertion is found in experimental results that show how such processing produces pahs and fullerenes at the same time @xcite .",
    "moreover , all c@xmath0 pne furthermore show the so - called 30 @xmath4 m feature that is generally attributed to mgs ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but that also has been linked to hacs @xcite .",
    "they then interpret the pah - poor and fullerene - dominated sources tc  1 and smp  smc  16 as environments where the more hardy c@xmath0 molecules have survived whereas the pahs have been destroyed .",
    "it is clear that  in the context of astrophysical fullerenes  this scenario presents several difficulties as well .",
    "first , if hac photo - processing is the general mechanism to produce pahs and fullerenes in pne , and if the 30 @xmath4 m feature is indeed related to hacs , one would expect all pne that exhibit the 30 @xmath4 m feature to also exhibit pah and fullerene bands .",
    "second , it seems unlikely that uv photo - processing is a viable mechanism to explain the formation of c@xmath0 in evolved stars with much lower uv irradiation than is the case in the pne  such as the proto - pn iras 01005 + 7910 @xcite but especially the two post - agb stars presented by @xcite with effective temperatures of the order of only 6,000  k. finally , if tc  1 and smp  smc  16 represent environments where the fullerenes have survived and pahs have not , it is hard to explain the numerous pne that show clear pah features but no c@xmath0 bands .",
    "it is important to realize that the mixture of carbonaceous species that results from hac photo - processing in the laboratory experiments is quite different from what is observed in the c@xmath0 pne .",
    "the mass spectra reported by @xcite do indeed show the presence of fullerenes , but fullerenes certainly do not dominate the mass distribution . in all experiments ,",
    "the photo - processing products include many more ( dehydrogenated ) pahs , and low - mass molecules ( and molecular fragments ) containing h. thus , to explain objects such as tc  1 and smp  smc  16 where abundant c@xmath0 is seen but no pahs nor small species are present , significant _ additional _ processing of these sputtered species would be required to destroy the smaller molecules and the pahs .",
    "uv radiation could conceivably dissociate some of the smaller molecules , but it is not clear how pahs could be destroyed by radiation in the low - excitation environments represented by the c@xmath0 pne . if , on the other hand , collisions are involved , the carbon clusters are processed under similar conditions as described above  and either result in fullerenes dominating the distribution ( in the absence of h ) , or in the formation of pahs .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the simultaneous presence of the c@xmath0 bands and the pah features in the spectra of some pne does not necessarily imply that they are co - located  merely that they are both located in the spitzer beam .",
    "in fact , there is clear observational evidence in another object that pahs and fullerenes are _ not _ co - located . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ngc7023:c60 ] , we have reproduced the spatial distribution of molecular hydrogen , pahs and fullerenes in the reflection nebula ngc  7023 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig .  3 )",
    "the c@xmath0 emission peaks on the central star , whereas the pahs are clearly located further away from the star .",
    "thus , although the spectra of the entire nebula show both pah and fullerene features , both components show clearly different spatial distributions  no pah emission is found where the c@xmath0 peaks .",
    "such a distribution could well be the case for ( some of ) the pne as well .",
    "+ the two processes discussed above are not the only ways to form circumstellar fullerenes .",
    "an important third route involves high - temperature processes , and allows the formation of fullerenes in h - rich environments .",
    "laboratory experiments carried out by @xcite demonstrate that the temperature in the condensation zone determines the formation pathways of carbonaceous particles with a clear distinction between the resulting condensation products . at temperatures higher than 3500  k , the resulting particles are fullerene compounds and fullerene - like carbon grains ( even in the presence of hydrogen ) ; at temperatures lower than 1700  k , soot is formed with a large mixture of pahs as by - products",
    ". this high - temperature mechanism may be relevant to explain the fullerenes in the rcbs @xcite , but a value of 3500  k is certainly not a typical temperature in the circumstellar environment of carbon stars .",
    "it remains to be seen whether such a formation route is also important for pne .    finally , a promising route in the astronomical settings presented here , is that fullerenes form following the destruction of pahs .",
    "@xcite studied the effects of shocks on interstellar pahs , and found that the pah structure is at least significantly altered ( if not destroyed ) for shocks with velocities between 75150 km s@xmath17 and in the hot post - shock gas .",
    "pahs first lose their peripheral h - atoms , and then the resulting carbon clusters could assemble into fullerenes on fairly short timescales .",
    "this would certainly also be a viable route in pne .",
    "assembling fullerenes from pah destruction could also explain the different spatial distribution of pahs and fullerenes in ngc  7023 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ngc7023:c60 ] ) .",
    "the fullerene species c@xmath0 and c@xmath1 have been identified in a variety of astronomical objects .",
    "it seems clear that fullerenes form in the circumstellar environments of evolved stars , and that they survive and thrive in the interstellar medium as well .",
    "it is less clear precisely how they form , and what their excitation mechanism is , and those topics remain a matter of debate and further research .",
    "the derived abundances indicate that @xmath20.5% of the cosmic carbon could be in the form of c@xmath0 , and thus fullerenes represent a significant component of interstellar matter .",
    "+ fullerenes and fullerene compounds have often been suggested as possible carriers for some of the diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) .",
    "neutral c@xmath0 is probably not a dib carrier , but c@xmath18 has been suggested as a carrier for some dibs @xcite .",
    "fullerene compounds offer many more possibilities .",
    "fullerenes are readily protonated ( see e.g. the review on c@xmath0 cation chemistry by * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and it is thus quite possible that fulleranes ( hydrogenated fullerenes ) might be present in the ism or in circumstellar environments as well . it has been suggested that fulleranes could play a role in the formation of h@xmath19 @xcite and in interstellar extinction .",
    "c@xmath18 was found to be generally quite unreactive at room temperature ; nonetheless , many derivatization reactions have been studied in laboratory experiments , including reactions with species that have been detected in the ism ( again , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and could thus also be relevant for interstellar chemistry .",
    "fullerenes are also unique in their ability to lock up atoms and small molecules inside their carbon cage .",
    "such endohedral species have also been proposed as dib carrier candidates , but have only been poorly studied in detail spectroscopically .",
