    "electrokinetic phenomena , which couple fluid flow , ion transport and electric fields in electrolytes , are exploited in a variety of microfluidic technologies  @xcite .",
    "a solid surface in contact with an electrolyte typically acquires a surface charge and forms an electric double layer composed of wall charge and a screening layer of excess counterions .",
    "electro - osmosis results from the action of an applied electric field on this double - layer charge , which sets the bulk fluid into motion . although the double layer is typically very thin ( nm ) compared to the channel dimensions ( @xmath2 m ) , it is the source of long - range flow patterns .",
    "the classical continuum theory of electro - osmosis  @xcite suffices to understand most direct - current ( dc ) electro - osmotic flows , which are linear in the applied voltage .",
    "dc electroosmosis results from application of an external electric field parallel to the surface , which acts on equilibrium double - layer charge and induces motion in the bulk , neutral liquid .",
    "the linear response is due to the assumption that the applied field does not perturb the pre - existing surface charge . when dc electroosmosis is used in microfluidic environments ,",
    "electrodes are placed at the ends of relatively long ( cm ) channels , and therefore large voltages ( kv ) are typically needed to generate sufficient fields .",
    "electrokinetic phenomena can be exploited at much lower voltages and with much greater precision by placing electrodes close together _ inside _ the fluid channels and using alternating current ( ac ) to inhibit faradaic reactions . large electric fields",
    "( 100 v / cm ) needed to induce adequate flow can thus be generated with only a few volts by micro - electrodes .",
    "the most studied example is alternating - current electro - osmosis ( aceo ) @xcite , discovered by ramos et al .",
    "when a periodic array of interdigitated electrodes is placed inside the channel , an ac signal applied to the electrodes can generate a steady set of micro - vortices .",
    "ajdari showed that if geometrical asymmetry is introduced , then these vortices can be rectified to drive net pumping in one direction over the array  @xcite .",
    "the original implementation of this principle was a planar array of flat electrode pairs of unequal widths and gaps  @xcite , as shown in figure  [ fig : schematic ] .",
    "recent designs for `` 3d aceo '' pumps have achieved much faster flows ( mm / sec ) using non - planar electrodes , which more efficiently rectify opposing slip velocities in a `` fluid conveyor belt ''  @xcite .",
    "waves of voltage can also pump fluids over electrode arrays by traveling - wave electro - osmosis ( tweo )  @xcite .",
    "these effects exemplify the fundamental nonlinear electrokinetic phenomenon  @xcite of induced - charge electro - osmosis ( iceo )  @xcite , which also has other applications in microfluidics .",
    "the key source of nonlinearity is that the diffuse double - layer charge is _ induced _ near a polarizable surface by the applied electric field , which then acts on it to drive nonlinear electro - osmotic flow .",
    "although iceo flows were first described in the 1980s in the context of colloid science  @xcite , they are finding new applications in microfluidic devices .",
    "as in the case of aceo pumps , broken spatial symmetries in iceo flows can also be used to pump fluids around polarizable microstructures and to manipulate polarizable particles  @xcite .    the current theory of iceo flow  @xcite , including aceo  @xcite and tweo  @xcite microfluidic pumps , is based on the classical electrokinetic equations  @xcite .",
    "this century - old model comprises the poisson - nernst - planck ( pnp ) equations of ion transport coupled to the navier - stokes equations of viscous fluid flow via electrostatic maxwell stresses .",
    "the crucial modification is in the boundary conditions , relaxing the assumption of fixed surface charge ( or constant zeta potential ) to allow for significant electrostatic polarizability of the surface ( e.g. fixed surface potential ) .",
    "the electrokinetic equations themselves , however , have not been questioned , until very recently  @xcite , which provides the motivation for this work .",
    "iceo flows typically involve _ large voltages _ induced across the double layer , greatly exceeding the thermal equilibrium voltage , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 mv at room temperature ) .",
    "in particular , experimental aceo electro - array pumps  @xcite , the subject of our study , usually apply several volts to the double layer .",
    "such large voltages of order @xmath6 inevitably lead to the breakdown of the pnp equations by violating the fundamental assumption of an ideal dilute solution  @xcite .",
    "the limitations of dilute solution theory for double - layer structure are well known , and many attempts have been made to incorporate effects such as steric exclusion and electrostatic correlations .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review . )",
    "iceo flow , however , raises new issues due to its more extreme , dynamical context  @xcite .",
    "even if the bulk solution is dilute , the surface becomes so highly charged by the induced voltage that counterions become crowded in the double layer , while simultaneously driving tangential fluid flow .",
    "the need for improved models is also indicated by some unexplained features of iceo experiments . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the tendency for planar aceo pumps to reverse at high voltage  @xcite , which naturally poses problems for microfluidic applications , if it can not be reliably predicted .",
    "the standard model of aceo based on the classical electrokinetic equations predicts a single peak in the flow rate versus frequency at the characteristic `` rc '' charging frequency of the electrodes , in both the linear  @xcite and nonlinear  @xcite regimes .",
    "flow reversal has been observed at high voltage ( @xmath7 v ) and high frequency ( 10 - 100 khz ) in aceo pumping of dilute kcl  @xcite and deionized water  @xcite with @xmath8 m scale electrode arrays .",
    "representative examples of the observed and predicted frequency response are shown in figure [ fig : jpdata ] for the pump geometry of figure  [ fig : schematic ] .",
    "here we compare experimental data taken at 3.0 v @xmath9 in an 0.03 mm kcl solution over gold electrodes  @xcite to simulations with two commonly used models : one assumes the linear debye - huckel ( dh ) model of the double layer  @xcite , while the other adopts a non - linear poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) model based on the gouy - chapman solution  @xcite . following prior work  @xcite , a constant stern - layer capacitance is added in order to better _ fit _ the experimental data by matching the peak frequency in the dh model .",
    "both models can reasonably fit the data in terms of the peak in the forward pumping , though this becomes more difficult for pb at higher voltages @xcite .",
    "each model predicts a single peak of forward flow , while the experiments show the pump reversing above 10 khz .",
    "the inability of these classical models to capture , even qualitatively , this high frequency flow reversal motivates us to consider modified double - layer models .",
    "the reversal of aceo pumps has been considered in several previous studies .",
    "flow reversal was first attributed to faradaic reactions  @xcite , and this view of `` faradaic charging '' persists in recent work on dc - biased ac electro - osmosis  @xcite .",
    "simulations of aceo pumps with butler - volmer reaction kinetics , however , have failed to predict the observed flow , especially at high frequency  @xcite . in existing models , a weak flow reversal due to reactions",
    "can only be observed at low frequency ( far below the maximum ) and for certain sets of parameters  @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the observation of gas bubbles from electrolysis at low frequency and high voltage in dilute kcl with gold electrodes  @xcite .",
    "recently , higher resolution measurements of the same pump design with platinum electrodes have revealed very weak ( @xmath10m / sec ) reverse aceo flow at low frequency ( @xmath11 khz ) and low voltage ( @xmath12 v ) and have demonstrated the importance of faradaic currents through _ in situ _ impedance spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "although the theory predicts similar flow reversal , it is not in quantitative agreement and does not predict the concentration dependence .",
    "in addition to faradaic reactions , various other nonlinear effects in dilute solution theory also dominate at low frequencies : the differential capacitance of the diffuse layer  @xcite diverges , which causes the rc charging time to grow exponentially with voltage  @xcite , and salt adsorption and tangential conduction by the diffuse layer are coupled to ( much slower ) bulk diffusion  @xcite .",
    "all of these effects have recently been incorporated in simulations of aceo at large voltages using the classical electrokinetic equations , but high - frequency flow reversal was not observed  @xcite .",
    "another possible source of flow reversal is ac electrothermal flow  @xcite , which can lead to reverse pumping in experiments with planar electrode arrays  @xcite , but under different conditions of much higher salt concentration ( @xmath13 1 m ) , voltage ( @xmath14 v ) and higher frequency ( @xmath15 khz ) than aceo ( @xmath16 m , @xmath17 v , @xmath18 khz ) . to date , none of the above effects have been able to explain the experimental data for aceo pumps .    in this paper , we propose steric effects of ion crowding in the double layer as a possible cause of the observed flow reversal at high frequency . using simple modifications of the electrokinetic equations to account for finite ion sizes , we are able to predict a frequency response of aceo pumps that is very similar to that observed in experiments . although our results do not provide a complete quantitative theory , we will demonstrate that accounting for steric effects can have an important impact on the theory of aceo .",
    "in the dilute - solution theory of electrolytes  @xcite , the concentration of each ionic species in the diffuse part of the electric double layer at a charged surface is in thermal equilibrium with a boltzmann distribution , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath21 the temperature , @xmath22 the electron charge , @xmath23 the valence , @xmath24 the concentration in the neutral bulk electrolyte just outside the double layer , and @xmath25 is the ( mean ) electrostatic potential relative to the bulk ( @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the debye - hckel screening length ) . in classical linear",
    "electrokinetic phenomena , the diffuse - layer voltage drop @xmath28 is set by chemical equilibrium at the surface and is thus typically comparable to the thermal voltage @xmath4 . at an electrode driving aceo flow , however , much larger diffuse - layer voltages @xmath29 are _ induced _ by a applied voltage of order @xmath6 . under these conditions , it is easy to see that boltzmann equilibrium ( [ eq : cminus ] ) breaks down by predicting diverging concentrations of counterions at the surface , of order @xmath30 .",
    "the assumption of a dilute solution is thus incompatible with a large applied voltage .",
    "if we assume ions have a characteristic length scale , @xmath31 , then the corresponding cutoff concentration @xmath32 for the breakdown of dilute - solution theory is reached at relatively low voltage , even if the bulk salt solution is very dilute .",
    "for example , for @xmath33 m , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 (including a solvation shell ) , the cutoff concentration is reached at @xmath36 v. to account for the excess ions ( at typical equilibrium voltages ) , stern postulated a compact layer of solvated ions of finite size on the surface  @xcite , which carries most of the double - layer voltage as the diffuse - layer capacitance diverges .",
    "such an intrinsic `` surface capacitance '' is also invoked in models of iceo flows , where it can also include the effect of a thin dielectric coating on a metal surface  @xcite .",
    "it seems unlikely , however , that an atomically thin stern or coating layer could withstand several volts , e.g. since dielectric breakdown occurs in most materials ( including water ) in fields of order 10 mv / m @xmath37 v / nm  @xcite .",
    "instead , it seems the diffuse layer must carry a substantial voltage @xmath38 in aceo experiments , which causes the ions to become highly crowded near the surface .",

    "[ fig : c](a ) , when a large voltage is applied , the counterion concentration exhibits a smooth transition from an outer pb profile to a condensed layer at @xmath41 near the surface .    in aceo , charging dynamics are very important , so the double - layer capacitance is an important property .",
    "dilute - solution theory predicts that the differential capacitance , @xmath42 , diverges with the voltage as , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the voltage applied across the double layer . for a concentrated solution described by bikerman s model ,",

    "we will show that this general decrease in capacitance with voltage that can drastically impact the charging dynamics in aceo flows .    as biesheuvel _ et al .",
    "_ point out  @xcite , bikerman s latticed - based approach can underestimate the true steric effect to a large degree , and more accurate models of the entropy of a hard - sphere liquid , such as the carnahan - starling ( cs ) equation of state or various extensions to multicomponent mixtures  @xcite , can be used instead .",
    "the cs equation is not tractable for a closed - form analytical expression for double - layer capacitance , but we can easily obtain it numerically as a function of the voltage . for the details , see the appendix .",
    "although various mean - field models , such as cs , are very accurate for equilibrium properties of the hard - sphere gas and liquid at low to moderate volume fractions , @xmath47 , none can claim to accurately describe the packing limit at large volume fractions , which would generally lead to the decrease in double - layer capacitance at large voltage  @xcite .",
    "for example , these models predict a diverging chemical potential only at @xmath48 , and not and not at the mathematical packing bound ( @xmath49 , corresponding to the face - centered cubic lattice ) or the more relevant bound of the jamming transition ( around @xmath50 for hard spheres  @xcite ) . even in simple model systems in equilibrium ,",
    "the jamming transition is poorly understood  @xcite , so none of these models can possibly be expected to accurately capture the dynamics of jamming of hydrated ions very close to a surface driven by a large ac voltage , while also producing aceo flow .",
    "of course , under such extreme conditions , the mean - field approximation for both steric and electrostatic interactions should also be questioned .    due to all of these complexities , following bazant _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , we will focus on the simplest approximation of bikerman s model in order to explore the qualitative impact of steric effects on aceo flow .",
    "it will turn out that this very simple model suffices to predict high frequency flow reversal of aceo pumps .",
    "we will then repeat some calculations with the cs model , which improves the agreement with experiments somewhat , but does not alter the qualitative predictions of bikerman s model .",

    "@xcite , to our knowledge , these results represent the first demonstration of a mathematical model that can predict such reversal of flow in aceo pumps .    in order to understand the physical mechanism of flow reversal ,",
    "we must first understand why there is flow at all .",
    "the basic mechanism for flow in aceo can be best understood when considering a geometrically symmetric electrode array , as in fig [ fig : mechanism ] , subjected to a suddenly applied dc voltage ( without any faradaic current )  @xcite . when the voltage is initially switched on",
    ", the electric field lines point from the positive to the negative electrodes as shown in fig [ fig : mechanism](a ) .",
    "since there is initially no double layer charge , the field lines are perpendicular at the electrode surface",
    ". a current will begin to flow through the electrolyte with ions migrating along the electric field lines and the double layers over the electrode will begin to charge as shown in fig [ fig : mechanism](b ) .",
    "the electric field is strongest at the electrode edges and the resulting high current quickly charges the double layer at that location . on the order of the characteristic charging time , @xmath78 , ( as computed using the gap length scale ) the electrode edges will be significantly screened . in fig",
    "[ fig : mechanism](b ) we show the charge at @xmath52 at three instances in time .",
    "as the double layers charge up , the electric field lines in the fluid bulk are diverted around the screened electrode edges , resulting in a tangential component of the electric field .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mechanism](c ) where we can see the field lines are no longer perpendicular over the entire electrode , especially near the electrode edges .",
    "the tangential electric field exerts a force on the fluid in the charged double layer , causing flow .",
    "given the direction of the field and sign of the charge , the flow always goes from the edge of the electrodes , inward .",
    "the flow streamlines and flow direction are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mechanism ] ( d ) .",
    "if the applied voltage is maintained , eventually the entire electrode becomes fully screened there is no electric field in the bulk and the flow will stop . the above argument about the direction of flow did not depend upon the sign of the applied voltage , reversing",
    "the sign causes the same flow pattern .",
    "therefore , if an ac voltage is applied at a frequency corresponding to the charging time , time averaged vortex flow can be maintained .",
    "ajdari introduced the idea of rectifying this symmetric flow pattern to create an aceo pump by introducing various forms of geometrical asymmetry within each spatial period of the electrode array @xcite .",
    "this principle was first implemented by brown _",
    "_ using flat , co - planar electrodes of different widths and gaps  @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] , and this general design has been studied extensively by several groups  @xcite . in this geometry ,",
    "the symmetry breaking causes the flow to go from left to right by upsetting the delicate balance between leftward and rightward slip patterns .",
    "the fact that pumping comes from a relatively small bias of opposing , co - planar surface flows makes this design susceptible to flow reversal if nonlinearities in charging dynamics tip the balance the other way , as we demonstrate below .",
    "current designs using stepped , three - dimensional electrodes are much faster and more robust against flow reversal , since the opposing slip patterns work together to drive pumping in one direction , as a `` fluid conveyor belt ''  @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity to flow reversal in the planar pump , however , allows us a better opportunity to explore subtle nonlinearites in double - layer charging dynamics , which is why we have chosen it for our theoretical study .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : flow ] we demonstrate how the geometrical asymmetry results in forward flow when driven at the charging time and how steric effects can produce high frequency reversal . in fig .",
    "[ fig : flow](a ) and ( b ) we show the time averaged streamlines ( a ) and time average slip velocity ( b ) for the aceo pump driven at the charging time , corresponding to point a in fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] .",
    "we notice a few features of the slip profiles .",
    "first , the magnitude of velocity over the small electrode is greater than the velocity over the large electrode .",
    "this difference is due to the fact that the _ total _ charge contained on both electrodes must be the same , the local charge density ( and thus electroosmotic slip ) is always higher on the small electrode .",
    "second , we notice slip profiles over either electrode is asymmetric with the greatest slip found at the edges at the small gap .",
    "this effect is simply due to high electric field in the small gap which can exert a larger force .",
    "finally we see the asymmetry in the slip is greater for the large electrode than the small electrode , an effect due to the geometry .",
    "the result for this geometry and frequency is the net flow goes in the positive @xmath79 direction .",
    "the relative contributions to the flow is easily seen by the cumulative spatial integral of the time averaged slip ; the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : flow ] ( b ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : flow ] ( c ) and ( d ) we show the behavior at the approximate peak of the reverse flow in fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] , corresponding to point b in fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] . the same generic features of the slip profiles are the same as in ( b ) .",
    "however , the relative contributions have changed at this frequency .",
    "the reason for the reversal can be explained by the change in charging time for the different sized electrodes .",
    "when steric effects are included , we must remember that the capacitance decreases as more charge is stored inside the double layer . since the charge density over the small electrode is much greater",
    ", the capacitance of the small electrode s double layer is _ decreased _ at high voltage due to the steric effects .",
    "the lower capacitance means that the charging time of the small electrode is decreased relative to the large electrode .",
    "this change in charging time means that at high frequency and high voltage the small electrode has more time to sufficiently charge to generate flow .",
    "this idea is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : flow ] ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "the cumulative spatial integral of the time - averaged slip shows that the negative flow contribution from the small electrode is nearly twice the positive contribution . at this high frequency",
    "the large electrode is not very highly charged and its forward flow component adds only a small amount to the net .",
    "that this reversal is caused by the change in the charging dynamics can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : flow ] ( e ) and ( f ) , which shows the same condition as ( c ) and ( d ) only with the linear debye - huckel model ; point c in fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] . here , since the large electrode has the same charging time as the small electrode , its forward component is significant to provide a net positive flow .",
    "it is clear from these pictures that with the inclusion of steric effects , the direction and magnitude of flow in aceo pumps is determined by a delicate balance influenced _ both _ by the geometry and the charging dynamics .    up to now ,",
    "we have taken the volume fraction , @xmath39 , to be a constant . to better see the effect of @xmath39 on the predicted flow , in fig .",
    "[ fig : steric_nu ] we show contours of the flow rate as a function of voltage and frequency at different values of @xmath39 .",
    "for a fixed physical value of @xmath31 , different values of @xmath39 represent how the flow would change as a function of concentration ( in dimensionless terms ) .",
    "the heavy lines denote the region where the flow is negative , indicating a reversal of flow .",

    "is increased the nonlinearity begins to set in which causes the peak of the forward flow to move toward lower frequency as predicted by dilute solution theory . as the voltage",
    "is further increased the steric effects begin to become important with the reversal eventually setting in .",
    "the change in frequency of the maximum forward flow at higher voltage as @xmath39 changes is easily understood . as @xmath39 increases , the value of the maximum value of the capacitance decreases , shifting the peak response to higher frequencies . for a given @xmath39 , as voltage continues to increase , the continual decrease in the double layer capacitance can be seen in the shift of the maximum of the positive flow to higher frequency at high voltage .",
    "when there are no steric effects ( or stern layer ) the capacitance diverges , which can be seen in figure [ fig : steric_nu](d ) .",
    "the inclusion of the constant stern layer capacitance causes this decrease to limit at the constant stern layer capacitance @xcite .",

    "[ eq : q_full ] in our model .",
    "we follow the work of bieshuvel and soestbergen @xcite to obtain this relationship numerically , as described in the appendix .",
    "the result of using the cs equation in our aceo model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : studer ] ( b ) , and it is qualitatively similar to our prior results with the bikerman model .",
    "the cs steric model has somewhat different quantitative behavior but still requires an ion size of approximately @xmath83 nm to fit the experimental data . while the magnitude of the flow reversal changes with the cs equation , the use of a more accurate model for the excess chemical potential still require a relatively large ion size .",
    "in order to fit the experimental data , the aceo models modified for steric effects imply an ion length scale , @xmath31 , almost an order of magnitude larger than we would expect . a factor of 10 in ion size results in a factor of 1000 in @xmath39 .",
    "this difference means that while the response in fig .",
    "[ fig : steric_nu](a ) is closer to what is observed , it is fig .",
    "[ fig : steric_nu ] ( c ) that is predicted based on a reasonable hydrated radius for the ions .",
    "the current model can not yet predict the experimental data from first principles .",
    "it is important to note that the large value of @xmath39 is needed not to predict flow reversal at all , but to predict flow reversal at the frequencies observed in experiments .    as discussed in section  [ sec : steric ] , the mean - field models of steric effects which we consider are unlikely to accurately capture the dynamical formation of a condensed layer on the surface .",
    "one reason is the difficulty in describing the jamming transition , as ions and solvent molecules are squashed onto the surface by large , time - dependent normal electric fields . under such extreme conditions",
    ", we should not expect more than qualitative trends from such models .",
    "another possibly crucial feature missing in these models is the interaction with the surface , which is assumed to be a mathematically flat , homogeneously charged , perfectly rigid wall , as sketched in fig .",
    "2 . since the condensed layer of ( presumably solvated ) ions is at the scale of only a few molecular lengths , there must be a strong coupling with nanoscale roughness on the surface .",
    "this may have the effect of increasing the effective ion size , as we have inferred , since what matters is not the ion density in the solution , but the density very close to the surface , which is reduced by atomic asperities .",
    "the viscosity may also diverge near the surface as ions become jammed among surface inhomogeneities  @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to do experiments with atomically flat electrodes ( e.g. carbon graphene ) or ones with controlled nanoroughness to test this hypothesis .",
    "it is also possible that changes in permittivity , @xmath59 , within the double layer may also effect the frequency response .",
    "electrochemists infer for the stern layer that @xmath59 may be @xmath84 of @xmath59 in the bulk  @xcite .",
    "if it were true that @xmath59 is reduced by @xmath84 in the condensed layer , the overall double layer capacitance would be decreased .",
    "such change would cause the peaks in the frequency response to shift to higher frequency for the same value of @xmath39 .",
    "if we make the assumption that @xmath59 is reduced by a factor of ten in the _ entire _ double layer , then an ion size of approximately 1 nm is needed to predict studer _",
    "s @xcite data with the cs equation .",
    "if @xmath59 is reduced only in the condensed layer , the true effect on the frequency response would be less than predicted with the simple assumption .",
    "therefore , it seems likely that accounting for changes in @xmath59 would reduce the needed ion size to correlate the data , however at most this would reduce the ion size to 1 nm , still much larger than expected .",
    "a further complication is that the mean - field approximation breaks down when ion spacings approach the bjerrum length , @xmath85 , which is 7      for bulk water and monovalent ions ( @xmath34 ) . again , if it were true that @xmath59 is reduced by 1/10 in the condensed double layer , then @xmath86 nm .",
    "correlation effects on electro - osmotic flow ( which to our knowledge have never been studied ) could be very significant at large voltages , even in dilute bulk solutions  @xcite .",
    "while much work remains , we have highlighted an interesting and practically important application where dilute solution theory clearly breaks down .",
    "we have demonstrated that accounting for steric effects in double - layer models can have a dramatic impact on the predicted flow in aceo pumps .",
    "because of the large value of @xmath31 needed to fit the experimental data , we can not claim that our model definitively explains high - frequency flow reversal in aceo pumps , but it is the only plausible explanation to date .",
    "the prediction is also quite robust : we have found that flow reversal can be predicted by any model which accounts steric effects by the generic feature that the double layer capacitance decreases with applied voltage .",
    "physically , it seems that this generic effect of decreasing capacitance must be true for any model of the double layer considering finite sized ions  @xcite . as the voltage increases ,",
    "more ions are packed in the double layer .",
    "once the concentration of ions becomes so high that the packing density is reached , the ions would have to pile up forming a condensed layer whose thickness would increase with voltage . as the double layer thickness grows , the capacitance must decrease .",
    "we believe this general effect is true regardless of the details of the model , and we have shown that it has major implications for aceo pumping and , by extension , all nonlinear iceo flows .",
    "steric effects are clearly among the new effects which must be considered in developing more accurate theories of iceo flow at large applied voltages  @xcite .",
