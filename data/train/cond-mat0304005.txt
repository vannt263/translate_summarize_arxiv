    "during last ten years a possibility to measure the effects caused by an interaction of spatially separated carriers in low - dimensional systems has been demonstrated in a number of experiments .",
    "an undoubted evidence for such effects was obtained in drag experiments in which a voltage in one conducting layer caused by an electric current in the adjacent layer ( separated from the first one by a dielectric layer ) was observed .",
    "the drag effects have been registered in bilayer systems with the conductivity of the same type in both layers ( for instance , the electron - types)@xcite and in the layers with the conductivity of the opposite types ( electron - type in one layer and the hole - type in the other one ) @xcite . in the last case",
    "the interaction between spatially separated electrons and holes may result not only in the drag effect but also in an electron - hole pairing .",
    "the electron - hole pairs may condense into a specific superfluid state in which a supercurrent in one layer is accompanied by a supercurrent in the adjacent layer and these currents have the same absolute value but the opposite directions @xcite .",
    "the most favorable conditions for the electron - hole pairing are achieved in a case when a strong ( quantizing ) perpendicular to the layers magnetic field is applied to a bilayer electron - hole @xcite or electron - electron system @xcite ( with the total filling factor @xmath4 in the last case ) .",
    "the experimental discovery of the superfluidity of the pairs in such systems has been already reported @xcite .",
    "the possibility of pairing of spatially separated electrons and holes looks quite natural since there are coulomb attraction forces between an electron and a hole .",
    "unexpected and less obvious phenomenon consists in that in a strong magnetic field the coulomb repulsion between spatially separated equally charged carriers may result in a formation of metastable bound pairs .",
    "such an effect takes place in a situation when the magnetic fields applied to the first and the second layer of bilayer electron ( or hole ) system are antiparallel to each other .",
    "this possibility was predicted in our paper @xcite , where we assume that together with the antiparallel perpendicular to the layers magnetic fields the antiparallel to each other and parallel to the conducting layers electric fields are applied to the system .",
    "the disadvantage of the situation considered in @xcite is that the presence of the electric fields may result in an instability of the system with a macroscopic number of the pairs .    in this paper",
    "we show that a formation of a metastable bound state of spatially separated electrons ( or holes ) can emerge without the electric fields applied to the system and formulate the conditions of appearance of such a bound state .",
    "let us consider two two - dimensional electron layers with the interlayer distance @xmath5 embedded in a dielectric matrix with the dielectric constant @xmath6 .",
    "let the magnetic field in the top layer ( layer 1 ) is @xmath7 and the magnetic field in the bottom layer ( layer 2 ) is @xmath8 ( the @xmath9 axis is chosen perpendicular to the layers ) .",
    "the possible way of realization of such a configuration of magnetic fields will be discussed in the end of the paper .",
    "we specify the case when there is one electron belonging to the zero landau level in the layer 1 and one electron belonging to the first landau level in the layer 2 . in the symmetric gauge",
    "the vector potential in the layer 1 is equal to @xmath10 and in the layer 2 @xmath11 .",
    "the hamiltonian of a pair of interacting electrons has the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 here @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the two - dimensional vectors .",
    "we set the electron charge equals to @xmath18 .    in a strong magnetic field",
    "the bohr radiuses of the electrons @xmath19 , @xmath20 can be much larger then the magnetic length @xmath21 . in this case",
    "the coulomb interaction can be taken into account as a perturbation .",
    "it is known that the quantum problem of a particle in a quantizing magnetic field has a large degeneracy ( in the symmetric gauge with respect to the quantum number @xmath22 , the @xmath9 projection of the angular momentum ) .",
    "therefore , the common formulation of the theory of perturbations should be based on a solution of a secular equation .",
    "but such an approach is not an optimal method for the study of this problem .",
    "here we use another approach based on the projection of the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) into the subspace of the states of the pair of electrons in which the electrons in the layer 1 and 2 are frozen on the zero and the first landau levels , correspondingly ( it is just the approach used in the theory of the quantum hall effect ) .",
    "then the kinetic energy operator for the electron in the layer 1 @xmath23 is projected to @xmath24 ( here and further the bar symbols indicate the projected operators ) which is constant .",
    "we will omit this constant in the further consideration . in ( [ 5 ] )",
    "@xmath25 is the cyclotron frequency for the electron in the layer 1 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , the electron kinematic momentum components , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , the creation and the annihilation operators for the electron 1 on a zero landau level .",
    "it follows from the commutation relation for @xmath30 ( @xmath31=i\\hbar^2/\\ell_0 ^ 2 $ ] ) that @xmath32=1 $ ] as it should be .",
    "analogously , for the electron in the layer 2 one can find @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "to project out the @xmath35 operator it is convenient to rewrite it in a fourier - representation form ( we follow the procedure @xcite ) @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "the coordinates of the electron in the layer 1 can be presented as @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 are the coordinates of the centers of its orbit in the magnetic field",
    ". the operators @xmath39 and @xmath40 satisfy the following commutation relations : @xmath41=-i\\ell_0 ^ 2 $ ] . besides that , @xmath39 and",
    "@xmath40 commute with the momenta components @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "analogously , for the electron in the layer 2 we have @xmath44 where @xmath45=i\\ell_0 ^ 2 $ ] . now",
    "the projection of the operator @xmath46 is reduced to the independent projection of two commuting operators @xmath47 and @xmath48 : @xmath49,\\ ] ] @xmath50,\\ ] ] where the notation @xmath51 is used .",
    "the projection of these operators can be easily done : @xmath52.\\ ] ] substituting eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) into eq .",

    "the appearance of the integrals of motions in the problem considered is not accidental .",
    "the point is that the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) and the hamiltonian of the electron - hole pair coincide with each other up to a sign of the coulomb interaction . in the last ( electron - hole ) case there is the integral of motion - the momentum of the pair @xmath0 @xcite @xmath57.\\ ] ] in our problem the momentum of the pair @xmath0 is also the integral of motion . comparing eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) with eqs .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) and ( [ 8a ] ) we find the relation between the components of the momentum @xmath0 and the operators @xmath55 and @xmath56 : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the unit vector in @xmath9-direction .",
    "taking eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) into account we rewrite the energy of the electron pair as the function of its momentum @xmath0 : @xmath60    prior to analyze eq .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) we note the following .",
    "\\1 . using the method presented here one can also find the dependence of the energy of the pair on its momentum @xmath61 in a general case , when the electron in the layer 1 is `` frozen '' on the @xmath62-th landau level and the electron in the layer 2 - on the @xmath63-th level .",
    "the final result is @xmath64 where @xmath65 are the laguerre polynomials .",
    "the variant of the theory of perturbations used here allows to solve the problem also in the case when the condition @xmath66 is satisfied only for the one particle in the pair , while the bohr radius for the other particle can be of order @xmath67 .",
    "such a situation may take place if the effective masses of the carries differ considerably from each other ( @xmath68 ) , see @xcite .",
    "returning to the analysis of the result ( [ 14 ] ) we consider only the simplest case @xmath69 .",

    "( [ 16 ] ) the dependence @xmath77 at small and large @xmath78 .",
    "\\1 ) at @xmath79 @xmath80 where the energy @xmath81 and the effective mass of the pair @xmath82 read as @xmath83 one should note that in the approximation used the effective mass @xmath82 is determined only by the interaction between electrons .",
    "the bare masses @xmath84 and @xmath85 do not enter into the expression for @xmath82 .",
    "the bare masses determine only the larmour frequencies @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "\\2 ) at @xmath88 @xmath89 as it follows from eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) the energy of the electron pair as the function of the momentum @xmath78 increases at small momenta and decreases at large @xmath78 .",
    "numerical estimates show that the function @xmath90 reaches its maximum @xmath91 at @xmath92 . the dependence @xmath90 is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the existence of the local minimum of @xmath90 at @xmath93 is the main result .",
    "it has important consequences .",
    "there are simple and transparent reasons for the appearance of the local minimum in the case when the electron in one layer belongs to the zero landau level and the electron in the adjacent layer - to the first landau level .",
    "the wave functions are shown schematically in fig .",
    "2 ( rigorously speaking , the electron density distributions in the layers are presented in this figure ) .",
    "it is physically evident that in the case when the centers of the orbits of both electron coincide ( @xmath93 ) the energy of the coulomb repulsion is smaller ( local minimum ) than at small displacements from this configuration .",
    "one should note that the interaction energy @xmath90 is positive at all @xmath78 , which is natural since the repulsion forces act between the electrons .",
    "but the presence of the minimum gives an evidence of a formation of a metastable bound state of two electrons from the adjacent layers .",
    "actually , it is easy to find the average distance between the electron of the pair with the momentum @xmath0 @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the wave function of the pair with the momentum @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , these is a one to one correspondence between the momentum and the size of the pair . if the pair has the momentum @xmath96 then the average distance is @xmath97 . to separate the electrons on the infinite distance from each other ( when @xmath98 ) the energy barrier @xmath99 should be overcome .",
    "it means that the electron pairs with small momenta @xmath78 are in the quasibound state stable against different scattering processes in which the shift of the momentum of the pair is smaller then @xmath100 .",
    "the bound electron pairs are the bosons and , therefore , in the system of such pairs one can expect the transition into the superfluid state if the density of the pair is quite large .",
    "since the pairs are charged this state should be superconductive one .",
    "strictly speaking , the problem of a transition of the electron pairs into the superfluid state in the system studied requires further analysis .",
    "since the bound state of the pairs does not correspond to the true minimum of the energy the thermodynamic arguments can not be used to establish the conditions of the existence of the superfluid state . to clarify this question the probability of the transition from the state with a given number of the pair with zero or small momenta should be found .",
    "we expect that due to the presence of the barrier for pair decoupling in the two - particle problem a barrier for the destruction of the coherent state will exist in the many - particle problem as well",
    ". therefore , at the temperature smaller then the value of the barrier the time of life of the coherent state will be large .    in conclusion",
    ", we discuss shortly the question about the possibility to realize the magnetic field configuration required .",
    "this question is not so simple from the experimental point of view .",
    "actually , the fields should be of order of @xmath101 t. but we think this obstacle can be overcome .",
    "we propose two ways of possible solution of this problem .",
    "first , the required ( antiparallel ) configuration of the magnetic fields can be realized using the magnetized stripes of magnetically - hard materials ( like dy ) deposited on the bilayer structure . in ref .",
    "@xcite such a method was used for designing periodic magnetic fields with @xmath102 t with the aim to study the conducting properties of a two - dimensional electron gas in such fields . another possible way to create antiparallel magnetic field configuration can be based on using antiferromagnetic systems in which the spins in each layer are ferromagnetically ordered while they are directed antiparallel in adjacent layers .",
    "for example , such properties demonstrate the layered manganites ( lasr)@xmath103mn@xmath104o@xmath105 , the compounds widely studied now ( see , for instance , review @xcite ) .      99 gramila t j , eisenstein j p , macdonald a h , pfeiffer l n and west k w 1991 _ phys . rev .",
