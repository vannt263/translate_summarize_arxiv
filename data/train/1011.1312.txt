    "one of the current subjects of the particle flavor physics is to understand quark and lepton masses and mixings .",
    "the investigation of them , even if it is phenomenological , will provide a promising clue to new physics .",
    "the so - called  tribimaximal \" mixing observed in the neutrino mixing @xcite is very suggestive of a fundamental law in the lepton sector .",
    "usually , the observed tribimaximal mixing has been explained by assuming a discrete symmetry @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , as a neutrino mass matrix model without assuming any discrete symmetry , an unfamiliar model @xcite has been proposed by using a seesaw type neutrino mass matrix @xmath1 . in this model , the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath2",

    "the model @xcite can lead to a nearly tribimaximal mixing by assuming suitable up - quark mass matrix as we give a short review in the next section .",
    "the model has only four parameters : one ( @xmath11 ) is in the neutrino sector , and one ( @xmath12 ) is in the up - quark sector , and two ( @xmath13 ) in the down - quark sector .",
    "( here , we consider that the charged lepton mass @xmath14 are known parameters , and we do not count these parameters as adjustable parameters . )",
    "this model leads to excellent fitting for up - quark mass ratios @xmath15 and @xmath16 and neutrino mixing parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , only by adjusting the two parameters @xmath12 and @xmath11 . on the other hand , for down - quark sector",
    ", the fitting is not so excellent , especially , the predicted values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 are somewhat large compared with the observed values as far as we use parameter values which can give reasonable values for the observed down - quark mass ratios .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate an improved version of the above model and to search systematically for parameter values which can give reasonable quark mass ratios , quark mixing parameters ( cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing matrix ) and neutrino mixing parameters . in sec.ii",
    ", we will show that the four parameter model can not have reasonable parameter region consistent with four quark mass ratios , three neutrino mixing parameters , and four ckm mixing parameters . in sec.iii , we propose a revised model and give parameter fitting for 11 observables .",
    "( in the present model , we do not discuss the observed value @xmath22 for neutrino masses , because we can always have an additional one parameter which inevitably appears in the model and affects only the mass ratios @xmath23 , but does not affect neutrino mixing and observables in the quark sector . ) finally , sec.iv is devoted to the summary and discussions .",
    "in this section , we give a short review of a quark and lepton mass matrix model @xcite based on the supersymmetric yukawaon model , because , in this paper , we propose a revised version of this model .    in the yukawaon model , we put the following assumption :    \\(i ) we consider that the yukawa coupling constants are effectively given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 ( @xmath26 and so on ) are vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of new scalars @xmath27 with @xmath28 components of o(3 ) family symmetry and @xmath29 is an energy scale of the effective theory .",

    "\\(ii ) in order to distinguish each @xmath27 from others , we assume a u(1)@xmath37 symmetry ( i.e.  sector charge \" ) in addition to the o(3 ) symmetry , and we have assigned u(1)@xmath37 charges as @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "( the su(2)@xmath35 doublet fields @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are assigned to sector charges @xmath43 . )",
    "\\(iii ) for the neutrino sector , we assume @xmath44 , so that the yukawaon @xmath45 can also couple to the neutrino sector as @xmath46 instead of @xmath47 in eq.(2.2 ) .",
    "therefore , we can change the above model into a model without @xmath48 .",
    "hereafter , we read @xmath48 in eq.(2.2 ) as @xmath45 . besides , we can have a term @xmath49 in addition to the right - hand side of eq.(2.2 ) , because @xmath50 has the same u(1)@xmath37 charge as @xmath51 , i.e. @xmath52 .",
    "although this term ( 2.3 ) leads to an additional neutrino mass term , the term does not affect neutrino mixing @xcite as far as the neutrino mass matrix @xmath53 is real , , the inverse matrix @xmath54 is also diagonalized as @xmath55 by the same orthogonal transformation matrix @xmath23 ; when we take @xmath56 , @xmath57 is diagonalized as @xmath58 , so that we can diagonalize @xmath59 as @xmath60 . ]",

    "however , for simplicity , in this paper , we use the observed values of the charged lepton masses straightforwardly for the vev value as given by @xmath70 in other words , we have assumed the ad hoc relation ( 2.7 ) , the derivation of which is not discussed in the present paper .",
    "hereafter , for counting a number of  adjustable \" parameters , we do not include @xmath71 in the number . here",

    "in this paper , we will carry out parameter - fitting at @xmath104 , because we interest in the mixing values at @xmath104 . exactly speaking , fitting for the mass ratios",
    "must be done at @xmath105 gev . however , at present , our model does not intend to give so precise predictions of the quark mass ratios .",
    "for example , we know @xcite @xmath106 and @xmath107 even at @xmath108 gev ( @xmath109 ) . even in @xmath110 , the discrepancy is smaller than 20% . besides , the mass values are dependent on the value of @xmath111 in the susy model .",

    "on the other hand , in the neutrino mass matrix @xmath112 the majorana mass matrix of the right - handed neutrinos @xmath113 is given by @xmath114 here , we have introduced a new field @xmath115 with a vev @xmath116 in order to make  effective \" eigenvalues of @xmath117 positive , because the eigenvalues of @xmath118 give signs @xmath119 for the parameter value @xmath120 .",

    "<S> based on a supersymmetric yukawaon model with o(3 ) family symmetry , possible forms of quark and lepton mixing matrices are systematically investigated under a condition that the up - quark mass matrix form leads to the observed nearly tribimaximal mixing in the lepton sector . although the previous model could not provide a good fitting of the observed quark mixing , the present model can give a reasonably good fitting not for lepton mixing but also the quark mixing by using a different origin of the @xmath0 violation from one in the previous model . </S>"
