    "since its discovery in 1995 at the tevatron@xcite , the top quark remains the heaviest known fundamental particle to date . with a mass of 172.6 @xmath1 1.4  gev / c@xmath2@xcite , it is considered to be intimately connected with the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking in the standard model of elementary particle physics ( sm ) and also to be sensitive to physics beyond the framework of the sm .",
    "this article reports recent measurements by the cdf and d  collaborations that probe the sm expectations for deviations both in the production and decay of the top quark . after a brief outline of the top quark properties within the sm framework in section  [ sec : smtop ] ,",
    "the current status of measured top quark pair production rates is given section  [ sec : xsec ] , followed by a section on searches for top quark production beyond the sm .",
    "the subsequent three sections describe measurements probing the top quark decay in terms of branching fractions , search for flavour - changing neutral currents and the helicity of the @xmath3 boson in the top quark decay , respectively .",
    "a conclusion is given in the final section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "within the framework of the sm , top quark production at the tevatron proceeds mainly in pairs : @xmath4 via the strong interaction ( 85% @xmath5  annihilation and 15% gluon - gluon fusion ) .",
    "the corresponding production cross section has been evaluated at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd using two different approaches : one calculation considers soft gluon corrections up to next - to - next - to - next - to leading logarithmic ( nnnll ) terms and some virtual terms in a truncated resummation , yielding 6.77 @xmath1 0.42 pb for a top quark mass of 175 gev / c@xmath2@xcite , while another calculation using the nlo calculation with ll and nll resummation at all orders of perturbation theory gives 6.70@xmath6 pb for a top quark mass of 175 gev / c@xmath2@xcite . if a pdf uncertainty is combined linearly with the theoretical uncertainty for the first result  similar to what is done for the second result  both predictions exhibit not only similar central values but also similar relative uncertainties of @xmath712 - 13% .    due to its large mass",
    ", the top quark has an extremely short lifetime of approximately , which makes it decay before it can form hadrons  a unique feature setting it apart from all other quarks .",
    "since the top quark mass is well above the threshold for @xmath8 decays with @xmath9 being one of the down - type quarks @xmath10 , this two - body decay dominates the top quark decay .",
    "as each quark flavour contributes to the total decay rate proportional to the square of the respective ckm matrix element @xmath11 , top decays into @xmath12 and @xmath13 are strongly suppressed with respect to  the dominant decay @xmath14 .",
    "consequently , top quark pair events contain a @xmath15 and a @xmath16 quark from the @xmath17  decay , and depending on the decay modes of the two @xmath3 bosons , the observed top quark pair final states can be divided into three event classes :    1 .   in _ dilepton _ events , both @xmath3 bosons decay leptonically , resulting in a final state containing two isolated high-@xmath18  leptons , missing transverse energy  corresponding to the two neutrinos and two jets .",
    "this final state constitutes @xmath75% of the @xmath17  events ( not counting @xmath19 leptons ) and gives the cleanest signal but suffers from low statistics .",
    "lepton+jets _ events , one @xmath3 boson decays leptonically , the other one hadronically , resulting in one isolated high-@xmath18  lepton ,  and four jets .",
    "events in the @xmath20+jets or @xmath21+jets channels yield @xmath729% of the branching fraction ( @xmath734% when including leptonic @xmath19 decays ) and provide the best compromise between sample purity and statistics .",
    "3 .   in _ all - hadronic _ events , both @xmath3 bosons decay to @xmath22 pairs , resulting in a six - jet final state . with a branching fraction of @xmath746% ,",
    "this final state represents the biggest fraction of @xmath17  events , but it is also difficult to separate from the large background of multijet production .    all of these final states contain two @xmath15-jets from the hadronisation of the ( anti- ) @xmath15 quarks , and additional jets can arise from initial and final state radiation .",
    "top quark pair production cross section measurements provide a unique test of the predictions from perturbative qcd calculations at high transverse momenta . analysing all three event classes",
    "allows both the improvement of statistics of top events and studies of properties and important checks for physics beyond the sm that might result in enhancement / depletion in some particular channel via novel production mechanisms or decay modes .",
    "the following subsections give an overview of the cross section measurements pursued at the tevatron rather than quoting single cross section results , with the exception of the most precise single measurement to date , obtained by d  in the lepton+jets channel .",
    "all current measurements are summarised in figure  [ fig : xsecsummary ] .",
    "a typical selection of dilepton events requires two isolated high @xmath18  leptons ,  and at least two central energetic jets in an event .",
    "the most important physics background processes containing both real leptons and  are z/@xmath23+jets production with @xmath24 and the production of dibosons ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "instrumental backgrounds are to be considered as well , arising from misreconstructed  due to resolution effects in z/@xmath23+jets production with @xmath26 , and also from @xmath3+jets and qcd multijet production where one or more jets fake the isolated lepton signature .",
    "to ensure proper description of the instrumental backgrounds , these are usually modelled using collider data , while for the physics backgrounds typically monte carlo simulation is used .",
    "a further enhancement of the signal fraction in the selected data samples is possible by requiring additional kinematical event properties like the scalar sum of the jet @xmath18s @xmath27 to be above a certain threshold or rejecting events where both selected leptons have like - sign electric charge .",
    "the obtained purities in such selected samples are usually quite good with a signal to background ratio ( s / b ) better than 2 at least , although signal statistics are low .",
    "the acceptance for dilepton final states can be enhanced by loosening the selection to require only one fully reconstructed isolated lepton ( @xmath28 ) in addition to an isolated track ( `` @xmath29+track analysis '' ) . in particular , such a selection allows the inclusion of `` 1  prong '' hadronic @xmath19 decays .",
    "the top quark production cross section was recently measured for the first time also in the lepton+tau final state by d@xcite , using events with hadronically decaying isolated taus and one isolated high @xmath18  electron or muon . to separate real taus from jets ,",
    "a neural network was used , and the sample purity was enhanced by requiring @xmath15-jet identification ( see section  [ lpjxsec ] ) in the selected events .",
    "the result is shown together with the other measurements in figure  [ fig : xsecsummary ] .",
    "-tagged jets ( right)@xcite.__,title=\"fig : \" ] -tagged jets ( right)@xcite.__,title=\"fig : \" ]    a typical lepton+jets selection requires one isolated high @xmath18  lepton ( @xmath20 or @xmath21 which includes @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) ,  and at least 4 jets , yielding samples with a s / b around 1/2 .",
    "the dominant physics background to be considered here comes from @xmath3+jets production while the main instrumental background arises from qcd multijet production where a jet fakes the isolated lepton signature .",
    "the cross section can be extracted from such a selected sample either purely based on topological and kinematical event properties combined in a multivariate discriminant to separate the @xmath17  signal from background or by adding identification of @xmath15-jets . since topological analyses do not depend on the assumption of 100% branching of @xmath32 , they are less model - dependent than tagging analyses . on the other hand ,",
    "requiring @xmath15-jet identification is a very powerful tool in suppressing the background processes , which typically exhibit little heavy flavour content . with @xmath15-jet identification",
    ", the top signal can also be easily extracted from lower jet multiplicities , where topological analyses need to impose additional selection criteria like cutting on @xmath33 to be able to extract the signal .",
    "in addition , @xmath15-tagged analyses can provide very pure signal samples , easily exceeding a s / b @xmath34 10 in selections requiring at least four jets with two identified b - jets ( see for example figure [ fig : ljetsxsec ] ) .",
    "the identification of @xmath15-jets can be based on the long _ lifetime _ of b hadrons resulting in significantly displaced secondary vertices with respect to the primary event vertex or large significant impact parameters of the corresponding tracks .",
    "a combination of this type of information in a neural network tagging algorithm yields @xmath15-tagging efficiencies of about 54% while only about 1% of light quark jets are misidentified as @xmath15-jets  hence the improved s / b in tagged analyses .",
    "another way to identify @xmath15-jets is to reconstruct _ soft leptons _ inside a jet originating from semileptonic",
    "so far only soft-@xmath21 tagging has been deployed in @xmath17  analyses .",
    "the most precise @xmath17  production cross section measurement to date with a relative uncertainty of 11% has been performed by d  on 0.9  fb@xmath0 of data in the lepton+jets channel@xcite . for this measurement , two complementary analyses based on a kinematic likelihood discriminant and on @xmath15-tagging ( see figure  [ fig : ljetsxsec ] ) were combined and yield @xmath35 for a top quark mass of 175 gev / c@xmath2 . comparing this measurement with the theory prediction",
    ", the top quark mass can be extracted as well , yielding @xmath36  gev / c@xmath37 in good agreement with the world average .",
    "a first @xmath19+jets cross section analysis using events with hadronically decaying isolated taus and lifetime @xmath15-tagging was performed as well by d   the result is shown together with other measurements in figure  [ fig : xsecsummary ] .",
    "the all - hadronic final state is studied by requiring events with at least six central energetic jets and no isolated high @xmath18  leptons . due to the overwhelming background from qcd multijet production with a cross section orders of magnitude above that of the signal process",
    ", @xmath15-jet identification is mandatory for this final state .",
    "further separation of signal and background is achieved by using multivariate discriminants based on topological and kinematical event properties .",
    "figure  [ fig : xsecsummary ] provides an overview of recent cross section measurements performed by cdf and d .",
    "all measurements show good agreement with the sm prediction and with each other .",
    "the single best measurements are approaching a relative precision of @xmath38  =  10% that should be achievable for the datasets of 2  @xmath39 already at hand and provide stringent tests to theory predictions.with increasing datasets , these measurements naturally start to become limited by systematic uncertainties rather than statistical ones , but it will be possible to further constrain the systematic uncertainties as well using additional data .",
    "cross section measurements form the foundation for all further property analyses like the ones described in the subsequent sections of this article by characterising the datasets enriched in top quark pairs and providing the necessary understanding of object identification , background modelling and sample composition .",
    "various beyond the sm theories predict the existence of a massive @xmath40-like boson that could decay into @xmath17  and hence add a resonant production mode to the sm process .",
    "any such additional production would be visible in the @xmath17  invariant mass distribution provided the resonance @xmath41 decaying to @xmath17  is sufficiently heavy and narrow .",
