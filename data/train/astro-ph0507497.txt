    "the internal structure of a neutron star , whose cross section is schematically illustrated in fig . [ xsec ] , is believed to feature a sequence of layers of different composition .",
    "the outer crust , about 300 m thick with density ranging from @xmath7 to the neutron drip density @xmath8 , consists of a coulomb lattice of heavy nuclei immersed in a degenerate electron gas . moving from the surface toward the interior of the star the density increases , and",
    "so does the electron chemical potential . as a consequence ,",
    "electron capture becomes more and more efficient and neutrons are produced in large number through weak interactions .    at @xmath9",
    "there are no more negative energy levels available to the neutrons , which are therefore forced to leak out of the nuclei . the inner crust , about 500 m thick and consisting of neutron rich nuclei immersed in a gas of electrons and neutrons , sets in .",
    "moving from its outer edge toward the center the density continues to increase , till nuclei start merging to give rise to structures of variable dimensionality , changing first from spheres into rods and eventually into slabs .",
    "finally , at @xmath10 , all structures disappear and neutron star matter reduces to a uniform fluid of neutrons protons and leptons in weak equilibrium .    the density of the neutron star core ranges between @xmath11 , at the boundary with the inner crust , and a central value that can be as large as @xmath12 . just above @xmath13 the ground state of matter is a uniform fluid of neutrons , protons and electrons . at any given density",
    "the fraction of protons , typically less than @xmath14 , is determined by the requirements of weak equilibrium and charge neutrality . at density slightly larger than the equilibrium density of uniform nuclear matter , @xmath15 , the electron chemical potential exceeds the rest mass of the @xmath16 meson and the appearance of muons through the the process @xmath17 becomes energetically favorable .",
    "all models of eos based on hadronic degrees of freedom predict that in the density range @xmath18 neutron star matter consists mainly of neutrons , with the admixture of a small number of protons , electrons and muons .",
    "this picture may change significantly at larger density , with the appearance of strange baryons produced in weak interaction processes .",
    "for example , although the mass of the @xmath19 exceeds the neutron mass by more than 250 mev , its production becomes energetically allowed as soon as the sum of the neutron and electron chemical potentials equals the @xmath19 chemical potential .",
    "finally , as nucleons are known to be composite objects of size @xmath20 fm , corresponding to a density @xmath21 , it is expected that , if the density in the neutron star core reaches this value , matter may undergo a transition to a new phase , in which quarks are no longer clustered into nucleons or hadrons .",
    "it has long been recognized that the fermi gas model , leading to a simple polytropic eos , predicts a maximum neutron star mass @xmath22 , thus dramatically failing to explain the observed neutron star masses .",
    "this failure clearly shows that neutron star equilibrium against gravitational colapse requires a pressure other than the degeneracy pressure , whose origin has to be traced back to hadronic interactions .",
    "unfortunately , the need of including dynamical effects in the eos is confronted with the complexity of the fundamental theory of strong interactions , quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) . as a consequence , all available eos of strongly interacting matter",
    "have been obtained within models , based on the theoretical knowledge of the underlying dynamics and constrained , as much as possible , by experimental data .    while the properties of matter in the outer crust can be obtained directly from nuclear data , models of the eos in the inner crust , corresponding to @xmath23 , are somewhat based on extrapolations of the available empirical information , since the extremely neutron rich nuclei appearing in this density regime are not observed on earth .",
    "however , as most of the neutron star mass resides in the core region ( typically , the crust olny accounts for less than @xmath24 2 % of the total mass ) , the star properties discussed in this review are largely unaffected by the details of the eos describing the crust . in what follows",
    ", i will only discuss the eos of neutron star matter in the region of nuclear and supranuclear density , i.e. at @xmath25 .",
    "note that the results described in the following sections have been obtained under the two standard assumptions , whose validity has long been established , that i ) thermal effects can be disregarded and ii ) neutron star matter is transparent to neutrinos produced in weak interaction processes .",
    "models of the eos of neutron star matter at @xmath27 rest on the premise that in this density regime nucleons can still be treated as individual particles .",
    "this assumption appears to be reasonable , as the shape of the proton charge distribution , obtained by fourier transforming its measured elelctric form factor , is such that two protons separated by a distance of @xmath28 fm hardly overlap one another .",
    "the eos of nucleon matter is mainly obtained from two different approaches : nonrelativistic nuclear many - body theory ( nmbt ) and relativistic mean field theory ( rmft ) .    in nmbt ,",
    "nucleon matter is viewed as a collection of pointlike protons and neutrons , whose dynamics is described by the nonrelativistic hamiltonian h = _ i + _ j >",

    "the two - nucleon potential , that reduces to the yukawa one - pion - exchange potential at large distance , is obtained from a fit to the available data on the two - nucleon system , including both deuteron properties and @xmath24 4000 precisely determined nucleon - nucleon scattering phase shifts .",
    "the purely phenomenological three - body term , @xmath34 , is needed to reproduce the binding energies of the three - nucleon bound states and the empirical saturation properties of symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the many - body schrdinger equation associated with the hamiltonian of eq.([hamiltonian ] ) can be solved exactly , using stochastic methods , for nuclei with mass number @xmath35 .",
    "the energies of the ground and low - lying excited states are in excellent agreement with the experimental data .",
    "accurate calculations can also be carried out for uniform nucleon matter , exploiting translational invariace and using either a variational approach based on cluster expansion and chain summation techniques , or g - matrix perturbation theory .    within rmft , based on the formalism of quantum field theory ,",

    ", the curve labelled l corresponds to a rmft calculation including nucleons only@xcite , yielding a maximum mass of @xmath24 2.7 @xmath86 .    in 1998 ,",
    "andersson and kokkotas@xcite computed the frequencies of the f - mode , the first p - mode and the first polar w - mode of a non rotating neutron star for a number of eos available at that time .",
    "they fitted the results of their calculations with appropriate _ universal functions _ of the macroscopic properties of the star , i.e. mass and radius , and showed how these empirical relations could be used to put constraints on these quantities if the frequency of one or more modes could be identified in a detected gravitational signal .",

    "in addition to carrying out the analysis proposed by anderson and kokkotas@xcite , one may want to address a different , more direct , question .",
    "will the simultaneous knowledge of the mode frequencies and the mass of the star , its only accurately measured observable , provide a severe test to discriminate among different eos ?    as an example , let us consider the fundamental mode .",
    "numerical simulations show that this is the mode which is mostly likely to be excited in many astrophysical processes and its damping time is quite long , so that it should appear as a sharp peak in the spectrum of the gravitational signal .",

    "comparison between the curve labelled apr2 and those labelled aprb120 and aprb200 indicates that the presence of quark matter in the star inner core does not significantly affect the pulsation properties of the star .",

    "the bbs1 and apr2 eos , based on similar dynamical models , turn out to yield appreciably different f - mode frequencies .",
    "this is likely to be ascribed to the effect of the relativistic corrections included in the apr2 eos and to different treatments of three - nucleon interactions .",
