    "in recent years @xmath0@xcite has been studied intensively because of its close relationship with the isostructural high-@xmath15 superconductor @xmath16  @xcite . in both systems",
    "the transition - metal - oxide planes ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) can be doped with hole - like charge carriers resulting in a large number of different structural and electronic phases , in particular the superconducting phase in the case of the cuprates .",
    "although the nickelate system does not exhibit superconductivity , its investigation is very helpful to understand many features of the cuprates , such as oxygen phase separation  @xcite and stripe correlations .",
    "@xcite nickelates are quite amenable to study for several reasons : 1 ) high @xmath19 and @xmath5 can be reached , 2 ) it is much easier to obtain homogeneously oxygen - charged samples , and 3 ) stripe correlations are more stable and therefore easier to detect than in the cuprates . in most experiments",
    "the intension is to introduce holes either by sr substitution ( @xmath19 ) or by excess oxygen ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "however , as - grown sr - doped nickelates frequently contain a considerable amount of excess oxygen , which can have a strong impact on various properties .",
    "lack of knowledge of @xmath5 can lead to misinterpretations of properties of these materials .",
    "substitution of @xmath20 for @xmath21 appears to be random and has a relatively weak effect on the lattice .",
    "the phase diagram of @xmath14 in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) shows four structural phases : a high temperature tetragonal phase ( htt ) , a low temperature orthorhombic phase ( lto ) , a low temperature less orthorhombic phase ( lto2 ) and a low temperature tetragonal phase ( ltt ) .",
    "@xcite at room temperature the structure changes at @xmath22 from the lto to the htt phase , mainly due to the decrease of the sublattice mismatch between the ( la , sr)-o and the ni - o bond lengths with increasing hole content .",
    "excess oxygen occupies interstitial lattice sites centered within the lao    bilayers  @xcite and results in the formation of several structurally and compositionally distinct phases separated by miscibility gaps .",
    "@xcite the o - doping phase diagram has been studied by several groups with different techniques .",
    "@xcite though there are some discrepancies between the various proposed phase diagrams , most features are captured by our schematic diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "@xcite as a function of @xmath5 at room temperature the system shows a sequence of pure phases lto@xmath23ltt@xmath23htt separated by biphasic regions of lto / ltt and ltt / htt .",
    "these biphasic regions are the result of miscibility gaps which follow from the unmixing of interstitial oxygen defects into oxygen - poor and oxygen - rich phases .",
    "strong interstitial oxygen correlations give rise to these miscibility gaps . for moderate oxygen concentrations",
    "the htt phase transforms into a phase with one - dimensional ( 1d ) stage order of the oxygen interstitials upon cooling below room temperature .",
    "@xcite onset of staged ordering may involve opening of additional miscibility gaps or intergrowth of stacking faults in the staging sequence , allowing for variation in average oxygen stoichiometry throughout this compositional range .",
    "@xcite finally , at very high @xmath5 three - dimensional ( 3d ) oxygen order is observed .",
    "@xcite    in @xmath24 , the @xmath17 planes form a two - dimensional ( 2d ) spin @xmath25 heisenberg antiferromagnet ( af ) on a square lattice , with a nel temperature of @xmath26  k.  @xcite as the system is doped with an increasing concentration of holes @xmath10 , the commensurate af order is destroyed and a phase of static charge and spin stripes forms .",
    "the stripe phase is the consequence of an electronic phase separation into hole - rich charge stripes acting as antiphase boundaries between hole - poor af spin stripes .",
    "@xcite so far , for pure sr doping stripe order has been observed for hole concentrations @xmath27 and in the case of o doping for @xmath28 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "@xcite in the latter case , the first appearance of stripe order might be connected to that of the 3d order of the o interstitials  @xcite .",
    "the idea of an interplay between the electronic phase separation in the @xmath17 planes , the structural phase separations , and the o interstitial ordering within the rock - salt bilayers has been a strong motivating factor behind this work .",
    "we are interested in the question of how additional doping by sr affects the various phases and phase boundaries of the oxygen - content phase diagram .",
    "in particular , are the observed phases the result of purely steric effects of the interstitials or are they partially stabilized by electronic correlations ? beyond these questions",
    "it is desirable to map the structural phase diagram of ( sr , o)-codoped @xmath24  so that in future , for a particular sr content , the @xmath5 value of the sample can be determined simply by measuring its lattice parameters .    in the present paper , our focus is the study of specimens with fixed sr concentrations in the range @xmath29 and variable interstitial oxygen concentrations in the range @xmath2 at room temperature . phase separation into oxygen - poor and -rich domains similar to @xmath30 was observed for all @xmath6 .",
    "drastic changes occur only for higher sr concentration @xmath31 and 0.12 , where first the ltt / htt miscibility gap and then also the lto / ltt miscibility gap disappears . at such high sr concentrations the tilt angle of the coherent octahedral tilts , with respect to @xmath30 ,",
    "is already considerably reduced and finally becomes zero for @xmath8 .",
    "our results rely on a precise adjustment of @xmath5 , which we have accomplished by controlled atmosphere annealing under conditions of temperature and oxygen fugacity that depend on @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite in fact , we find that for all samples with @xmath32 an excess oxygen concentration smaller than @xmath33 is sufficient to induce an unmixing into oxygen - poor and oxygen - rich phases . hence ,",
    "to study the intrinsic properties of @xmath14  the oxygen content @xmath5 has to be zero , or at least @xmath34 .",
    "we compare our data with results for @xmath14  prepared in air , ca- and ba - doped @xmath24 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "several series of @xmath0 powder samples with fixed sr content ( @xmath19 ) and variable excess oxygen content ( @xmath5 ) have been prepared . the starting crystals with @xmath30 , 0.02 , 0.04",
    ", 0.06 , 0.08 , and 0.12 were obtained by congruent melt growth using radio frequency induction skull melting .",
    "@xcite to adjust @xmath5 , small crystal pieces were annealed at different temperatures in atmospheres with different oxygen fugacities @xmath37 ranging from @xmath38 to 0 .",
    "samples with low @xmath5 were obtained by anneals at 1000  @xmath39c and different @xmath37 .",
    "samples with medium and high @xmath5 were obtained by anneals at 900 , 750 , 600 and 450  @xmath39c in ar and pure @xmath40 respectively .",
    "the oxygen fugacity was monitored electrochemically using a y - stabilized @xmath41 cell against a 1  atm @xmath40 reference .",
    "all anneals were terminated by a quench to room temperature .",
    "the oxygen content was determined by iodometric titration .",
    "details of crystal growth , o - annealing , and chemical analysis are described in ref .  .",
    "synchrotron x - ray powder diffraction patterns at room temperature were collected at beamline x7a of the national synchrotron light source at brookhaven using a ge(111 ) monochromator at wavelengths @xmath42 of 0.66 , 0.7 , or 0.8 .",
    "photons were collected with a position - sensitive detector .",
    "@xcite spectra were typically acquired in the range @xmath43 by measuring in @xmath44 degree steps for 30 - 60 sec / step .",
    "powder samples were contained in glass capillaries ( @xmath45 0.4 mm ) sealed under argon . to avoid potential long - term exposure to oxygen between annealing and measurement ,",
    "capillaries were stored under mineral oil .",
    "essential for this study is the precise knowledge of @xmath5 for each specimen . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) we show the iodometrically determined @xmath5 values for the various sample series with fixed @xmath19 as a function of @xmath48 determined by x - ray diffraction .",
    "iodometric analyses were performed in triplicate under an inert atmosphere using de - aerated solutions and standardized thiosulfate .",
    "all samples in this diagram are single - phase , as determined from the diffraction measurements . within each of these series ,",
    "@xmath5 increases super - linearly as a function of @xmath48 . with increasing @xmath19 ,",
    "curves are shifted systematically to higher @xmath48 .",
    "anneals performed under the same conditions with specimens of different @xmath19 show a systematic decrease in @xmath5 with increasing @xmath19 .",
    "the absolute random errors of @xmath5  and @xmath48  were determined to be @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "note , that the relative error of @xmath48  ( @xmath51% ) is much smaller than those of @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath11 ( @xmath54% ) , since certain errors , as for example that from uncertainties in @xmath42 , cancel out in the ratio . to smooth and interpolate the results , we have applied empirical least - squares fits , indicated by the solid lines , to the @xmath5 vs. @xmath48 data .",
    "values of @xmath5 evaluated from these curves using the measured @xmath48 were subsequently used to plot other quantities as a function of @xmath5  or @xmath10 .",
    "the fits , shown in fig",
    ".  [ fig2 ] as solid lines , are power laws up to 3rd order , and were fitted simultaneously for all @xmath19 .",
    "the coefficients of the nonlinear terms were varied independently for each curve .",
    "the coefficient of the linear term , i.e. the initial slope at @xmath55 , as well as the value of @xmath48 at @xmath55 , were allowed to vary linearly as a function of @xmath19 .",
    "uncertainties in @xmath5 versus 2c/(a+b ) are primarily due to the limited mass of sample used for the individual titrations of large numbers of specimens . in future",
    ", we plan to characterize this relationship more carefully using larger specimens .",
    "this is expected to also reveal any fine structure that may be obscured in the fits provided here .      at high temperatures @xmath0",
    "is expected to have the ideal @xmath56 htt structure ( space group @xmath57 ) regardless of the oxygen stoichiometry .",
    "the crystal lattice consists of @xmath17 monolayers separated by @xmath58 rock - salt bilayers .",
    "each @xmath59 site is coordinated by six oxygens , resulting in a network of corner - sharing @xmath9 octahedra .",
    "the formal valence of the @xmath17 planes is negative while that of the @xmath58 bilayers is positive .",
    "doping with interstitial oxide ions or @xmath60 reduces the positive net charge in the rock salt bilayers .",
    "similarly , the compensating holes serve to reduce the negative net charge in the @xmath17 planes .",
    "overall , doping decreases the charge separation inherent to the structure , providing a stabilizing effect .    with decreasing temperature different structural transitions",
    "are observed depending on @xmath19 and @xmath5 .",
    "most of these low temperature phases can be described by different patterns of slightly - tilted , almost rigid @xmath9 octahedra .",
    "tilt angles are of the order of a few degrees and depend on temperature and doping .",
    "it is convenient to index all phases on the basis of the @xmath61 supercell , relative to the parent @xmath56 cell . in this supercell",
    "the interstitial @xmath62 ions reside at positions near ( @xmath63 ) , i.e. centered within the positive @xmath58 bilayers .",
    "@xcite in the htt phase ( @xmath64 ) the average octahedral tilt angle is zero .",
    "this means that the @xmath17 planes are either flat or there is at least no coherent tilt pattern .",
    "short - range correlations of octahedral tilts may exist due to local lattice distortion associated with o and sr dopants . in the lto phase ( @xmath65 ) , the octahedra tilt along the [ 010 ] direction . in the ltt phase ( @xmath66 ) the octahedral tilt axis",
    "is rotated in - plane by an azimuthal angle of @xmath67 with respect to the lto phase .",
    "since the direction of this rotation alternates in adjacent @xmath17 layers , tilt axes in adjacent layers are perpendicular to each other . often the lto2 phase ( @xmath68 ) is observed , which is an intermediate phase between the lto and ltt phases , since the tilt axis is rotated by an angle @xmath69 . at very high @xmath5",
    "an orthorhombic phase was reported for pure @xmath4 , for which the symmetry is @xmath70 .",
    "@xcite in the present study this phase was not observed , because in our sr - doped samples @xmath5 is not high enough .",
    "the powder diffraction spectra have been analyzed using the program rietica to determine the lattice parameters.@xcite the reflection conditions for the different phases are explained in ref .  .",
    "in the following , we focus on a few characteristic reflections ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) that are very helpful in distinguishing between the different phases and in determining phase fractions in the case of biphasic samples .",
    "the lto phase manifests itself by a split of certain reflections with @xmath71 such as @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "in addition , one observes superlattice reflections such as @xmath74 or @xmath75 , which indicate coherent octahedral tilts . in the case of the ltt phase ,",
    "the split for reflections with @xmath71 is absent , but the superlattice reflections @xmath74 and @xmath75 remain .",
    "mixed lto / ltt phases can be identified by the coexistence of split and non - split reflections as well as the presence of two of each of the superlattice reflections of @xmath74 or @xmath75 , since the lattice constants of the lto and ltt phases are different .",
    "since the resolution at high angles is better than that at low angles , we have determined the lto / ltt phase fractions from the @xmath73 reflections .",
    "the htt phase does not show any superlattice reflections ; hence , the ( 212 ) and ( 032 ) reflections are absent .",
    "mixed ltt / htt phases are most readily identified by a split of reflections such as @xmath76 and @xmath77 , as the @xmath11-axis of the ltt and htt phases are different .",
    "the @xmath11-axis differs also for the lto and ltt phases , but the difference is smaller and was not resolvable in our spectra .",
    "the lto2 phase shows a similar but reduced orthorhombic splitting of the fundamental reflections as in the lto phase as well as the superlattice reflections @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath24  at temperatures @xmath80  k exhibits the lto2 phase .",
    "@xcite in our room temperature spectra , no evidence of the lto2 phase was observed for any combination of @xmath19 and @xmath5 .",
    "representative spectra for the different phases of samples with fixed sr content x=0.02 and 0.08 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] along with the @xmath5 values . for @xmath81 ( top )",
    "the two miscibility gaps lto / ltt and ltt / htt were clearly detectable .",
    "pure phases were observed only for the lto and the htt phase .",
    "a pure ltt phase was not detected , most probably because none of our prepared samples matched the required @xmath5 value . for @xmath82 and",
    "0.06 we have in fact observed single - phase ltt samples . due to the narrow @xmath5-range of the ltt phase it is generally difficult to obtain ltt - type samples , which also explains the small number of reports on this phase .",
    "with increasing hole concentration , the structural differences between the lto , ltt and htt phases generally decrease since the sublattice mismatch diminishes , making phase separations more difficult to detect .",
    "this is clearly the case for @xmath7 ( bottom ) where the orthorhombic strain in the stoichiometric sample ( @xmath83 ) is already much weaker than for @xmath81 as one can see from the smaller splitting of the ( 155)/(515 ) reflections . with increasing @xmath5 we observed a mixed phase , but it was not possible to decide whether this phase is of the lto / ltt or lto / htt type . neither a pure ltt phase nor a mixed phase ltt / htt was observed .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath7 the ( @xmath84 ) reflection of the biphasic samples show a significant asymmetry , indicating a majority lto phase for @xmath85 and a majority ltt or htt phase for @xmath86 .",
    "usually , lto / ltt phase separation does not show up as clearly in a split of the ( @xmath84 ) reflection as in the case of ltt / htt phase separation .",
    "therefore , the asymmetry of the ( @xmath84 ) reflections for @xmath7 might indicate that the second phase is htt . to solve this problem measurements at low temperatures",
    "are needed , where the tilt angles are larger .      in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the lattice parameters as a function of the hole content @xmath87 . in this figure",
    ", only the data of single - phase samples or the majority phases of biphasic samples are included .",
    "[ we have also created plots ( not shown ) of the lattice parameters as a function of @xmath48 and the excess oxygen @xmath5 , but these provide no new insight . ] in plot ( b ) we show the average basal plane lattice constant @xmath88 versus hole content . at low hole doping @xmath89 the branches for the different sample series with fixed @xmath19 almost coincide .",
    "in contrast , at higher hole doping the branches are clearly separated .",
    "the branch for the highest ( lowest ) sr content shows the lowest ( highest ) values for @xmath88 .",
    "all other branches for the various @xmath19 values fill in systematically",
    ". a closer look at the lattice constants in the lto phase in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) shows that @xmath52 and @xmath53 follow a nearly universal dependence on @xmath19 and @xmath5 . within each set of points having fixed @xmath19",
    ", the left most point has @xmath83 , and then @xmath5 increases towards the right point .",
    "accordingly , the orthorhombic strain also follows a universal curve as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](d ) where we plot the orthorhombic splitting in percent of @xmath88 .",
    "interestingly , the c - axis length shows a nearly unique dependence on @xmath12 , as well [ plot ( c ) ] . as we will discuss later , this coincidence is not obvious .",
    "in fact , it turns out that the c - axis length not only depends on @xmath12 but also on the steric effects of the dopands .",
    "furthermore , we observe a change in the slope @xmath90 at around @xmath91 . at roughly this",
    "hole content , pure @xmath14  as a function of @xmath92 crosses over from lto to htt ( at room temperature ) .",
    "[ fig4](e ) shows the volume @xmath93 of the supercell , which reveals no significant new insights . for fixed @xmath19",
    "the general trend is that , with increasing oxygen content , @xmath93 first shrinks then saturates and eventually increases .",
    "obviously @xmath93 deviates from a linear dependence on oxygen doping , thereby violating vegard s rule .",
    "deviations from vegard s rule are not uncommon among strongly anisotropic and/or non - stoichiometric crystal structures .",
    "@xcite      the major differences between sr and o doping become very clear when comparing the lattice parameters for pure sr doping ( @xmath55 ) and pure o doping ( @xmath30 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show corresponding data as a function of @xmath12 . for both types of hole doping , the average basal plane lattice constant @xmath88 decreases [ plot ( a ) ] . with increasing hole concentrations",
    "the oxygen - doped samples show significantly larger @xmath88 values as well as a tendency to saturate . for sr doping",
    "@xmath88 decreases linearly , in agreement with vegard s rule . since the dependence of @xmath11 on @xmath19 and @xmath5 is almost identical [ plot  [ fig5](b ) ] , the large differences observed for @xmath93 are mainly due to the in - plane effects [ plot  [ fig5](d ) ] .",
    "the differences clearly show that the lattice parameters do not solely depend on the hole content but also on steric effects .      in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] we compare our results for pure sr and pure o doping with the lattice parameters from ref .   of sr - doped samples prepared in air that were not post - annealed .",
    "air - prepared samples frequently contain a considerable amount of excess oxygen . from fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] it is apparent that this excess oxygen causes huge differences between the lattice parameters of annealed and air - prepared samples , particularly at low sr concentrations . it is known that the excess oxygen concentration in air - prepared ( not post - annealed ) samples decreases with increasing sr content , typically reaching @xmath83 near @xmath94 , and that for larger @xmath19 oxygen vacancies are generated ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "it is for this reason that in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] the data points for pure sr doping and those of the air - prepared samples for large @xmath96 merge into a common sr doping dependence . from the lattice parameter @xmath11 in fig .  [ fig9](b )",
    "we estimate for the air - prepared sample with @xmath30 an excess oxygen content as high as @xmath97 .      in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we present the individual oxygen - content phase diagrams for the various fixed sr concentrations @xmath19 with regard to the lattice parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "all data points stem from single - phase samples or the majority phase of biphasic samples .",
    "pure phases are represented by shaded areas and miscibility gaps by white areas .",
    "the hatched areas were not covered in this study .",
    "as one can see , the maximum @xmath5 values obtained by anneals at 450  @xmath39c in @xmath40 , systematically decrease with increasing sr content . on the other hand the lowest @xmath5 values scatter around @xmath83 within the experimental error .",
    "in fact we assume that the most reduced samples are all very close to @xmath13 .",
    "note also , that the lattice parameters for @xmath30 and @xmath98 were taken from our earlier publication in ref .  , but were refit according to section  [ sec_delta ] . hence , minor systematic differences between the phase diagram for @xmath30 in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] and    those in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) and ref .",
    "are due to the fit procedure we have applied to all data sets ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) . for",
    "@xmath30 one can clearly see the sequence of the pure lto , ltt , and htt phases , as well as the mixed lto / ltt and ltt / htt phases for intermediate @xmath5 values .",
    "the phase diagrams for @xmath81 , 0.04 and 0.06 are qualitatively similar , but become increasingly difficult to resolve . according to our data , the @xmath5-range of the lto phase slightly broadens from @xmath30 to @xmath99 , while the ltt phase narrows .",
    "the pure lto phase at room temperature never exists at @xmath5 values higher than 0.01 .",
    "this means that @xmath5 has to be much smaller than 0.01 to be able to observe the intrinsic properties of @xmath14 .",
    "the ltt phase is centered at about @xmath100 , while the low @xmath5 phase boundary of the htt phase systematically shifts to lower @xmath5 values .",
    "drastic changes of the phase diagram are observed for @xmath101 . for @xmath7 we were not able to detect the pure ltt phase , nor the second miscibility gap .",
    "moreover , the @xmath5-range of the lto phase again becomes narrower . to confirm these results",
    "we have prepared a second series of samples with @xmath7 which showed essentially the same behavior . at the end of section  [ sec_spectra ]",
    "we argue that for @xmath7 the first miscibility gap might be of the lto / htt type rather than lto / ltt .",
    "measurements at low temperatures where the octahedral tilts are larger , are needed to verify this result . for @xmath8",
    "all samples are in the htt phase .",
    "only the most reduced samples show traces of the lto phase and measurements at low temperatures reveale that these samples are indeed close to the htt / lto transition which occurs at about 275  k. in conclusion , our results for @xmath101 clearly indicate a suppression of oxygen phase separation .",
    "possible reasons will be discussed below .",
    "finally , we emphasize that we do not observe any evidence for staging order or 3d interstitial order at room temperature .",
    "our experiments have revealed several key results .",
    "first of all , all sr - doped samples in general should be assumed to be codoped unless their oxygen content was determined to be @xmath55 .",
    "furthermore , our results show that one has to clearly distinguish between sr and o doping at any level of @xmath102codoping .",
    "as long as miscibility gaps appear , their @xmath5-ranges depend mainly on the amount of excess oxygen and not on the hole content .",
    "other features , such as the orthorhombic strain @xmath103 and the @xmath11 lattice parameter depend mainly on the hole content @xmath10 , independent of whether holes were introduced by sr or o doping . in contrast ,",
    "the average basal plane lattice constant @xmath88 ( and , therefore , also the unit cell volume ) depends explicitly on the individual concentrations of sr and o.      the microscopic mechanism of phase separation and the concomitant structural transitions is quite complex and not fully explored .",
    "the fact that the doubly negatively - charged oxygen interstitials are located within the positively charged rock - salt bilayers is consistent with the electrostatic environment .",
    "we assume that phase separation into oxygen - poor and -rich domains takes place by diffusion of the interstitials parallel to the rock - salt layers .",
    "diffusion along the @xmath11-axis is assumed to be negligible .",
    "( the diffusion process seems to be driven by the free energy ( @xmath104 ) rather than by self - diffusion .",
    "@xcite ) the final ground state is a delicate balance between lattice distortions , coulomb repulsion between the interstitial @xmath105 ions , and screening effects by the charge carriers in the @xmath17 planes . with increasing @xmath5",
    "the ltt phase becomes energetically favorable over the lto phase , though the stabilization of the initial ltt domains requires a minimum concentration of interstitials . within the first miscibility gap it is obviously energetically favorable for the interstitials to separate into oxygen - poor lto and oxygen - rich ltt domains , i.e. , the overall gain in lattice distortion energy by forming @xmath105 depleted lto as well as @xmath62 enriched ltt domains compensates the loss in coulomb energy due to the enhanced charge inhomogeneity in the rock - salt layers and possibly also in the @xmath17 planes .",
    "evidence for a charge inhomogeneity in the @xmath17 planes at this low level of o - doping comes from studies of the magnetic properties , which indicate the coexistence of domains with nel temperatures typical for the pure phases , i.e. the coexistence of domains with different hole concentrations .",
    "@xcite this is very similar to @xmath106  where phase separation results in superconducting and antiferromagnetic domains ,  @xcite indicating not only the formation of oxygen - rich and -poor domains , but also a corresponding charge inhomogeneity in the @xmath18 planes .",
    "the ltt phase exists only in a very narrow range of @xmath5 . at higher @xmath5",
    "the structure at room temperature eventually becomes htt .",
    "the htt phase is characterized by a disordered non - coherent octahedral tilt pattern .",
    "there are certainly several factors responsible for the doping dependent crossover from the ltt to the htt phase .",
    "we assume that in htt domains the reduction of the sublattice mismatch with increasing hole concentration has advanced to a degree , that no coherent tilt pattern is possible .",
    "the observation of orthorhombic staged phases at temperatures slightly below room temperature show that , in principle , a phase with a coherent tilt pattern can be induced at high hole and oxygen concentrations , as well .",
    "structural models proposed in ref .   suggest that the ltt structure is indeed more suitable to accommodate the interstitials than the lto phase . however , the concentration of excess oxygen is not the only parameter that determines the phase diagram . in @xmath35  for example , the @xmath5 range of the pure ltt phase is centered at @xmath107 in contrast to @xmath108 in @xmath4  ( see fig .  [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "@xcite moreover , no htt phase is observed between the ltt and the orthorhombic high-@xmath5 phase ( @xmath70 ) . since trivalent pr is smaller than la , in @xmath109  the sublattice mismatch is larger , i.e. the octahedral tilt angle is larger and the @xmath11-axis shorter .",
    "@xcite the change of the local environment of the interstitial site obviously makes it more difficult to stabilize the ltt phase .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in a pr based sample , annealed under identical conditions as a la based sample , the interstitial oxygen content is higher , which is also the reason for the larger accessible @xmath5 range in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] .",
    "so far , we have considered the effects of oxygen doping .",
    "additional doping with sr , on one hand introduces random lattice defects , and on the other hand coulomb repulsion between the relatively - negative ( compared to la ) sr sites and the o interstitials .",
    "furthermore , sr doping increases the concentration of holes .",
    "the holes in the @xmath17 planes might be expected to screen the @xmath105 interstitials , as well as the sr impurities in the rock - salt layers , which should result in a reduced o - o and sr - o coulomb repulsion . from our results , however , we have obtained no evidence that screening has a significant impact on the oxygen interstitials . on the other hand , our data yield clear signatures of an influence of sr doping on the oxygen - content phase diagram : the suppression of oxygen phase separation for @xmath101 as well as a weak change of the widths of the lto and ltt phases for @xmath6 .",
    "one possible explanation is that the coulomb interaction between the o interstitials and sr defects suppresses the tendency for phase separation into oxygen - rich and oxygen - poor domains .",
    "however , other factors can also cause the observed changes .",
    "as our comparison with @xmath35  has shown , it might well be that with decreasing octahedral tilt angle ( with increasing @xmath19 ) the phase boundaries shift in @xmath5 as well as in temperature .",
    "since the cusp of a miscibility gap is rounded , the @xmath5 range of the gap depends on the temperature of the experiment relative to the upper consolute temperature .",
    "this can explain a broadening or narrowing of the pure phases , too .",
    "in this context , the successive disappearance of the miscibility gaps for @xmath101 can occur if their upper consolute temperatures drop below room temperature .",
    "we note that , though the structural differences between the lto , ltt and htt phases decrease with increasing sr concentration , oxygen phase separation in principle should stay detectable . even in the extreme case of a phase separation into oxygen - rich and oxygen - poor htt domains ,",
    "the lattice parameters of these two htt phases would be different and therefore distinguishable . as we have no indication that this happens in our samples with @xmath110",
    ", we assume that we have indeed observed a suppression of the phase separation , as mentioned above .",
    "further measurements at variable @xmath111 to track the consolute temperature as a function of @xmath19 and @xmath5 , as well as at low @xmath111 where the lattice distortions are usually larger , are necessary to confirm this point .      in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we compare our results for the lattice parameters of @xmath0  with data for ba , sr and ca - doped @xmath24  from ref .",
    "and references cited therein , as well as @xmath109from ref .  .",
    "note that in ref .",
    "a broad sr range was covered ( @xmath112 1 ) .",
    "we limit our comparison to @xmath96 since only around this sr content does one obtain @xmath83 in typical air - prepared samples ( section  [ asprepared ] ) . we assume a similar situation for ca and ba doping .",
    "let us focus first on the behavior of @xmath11 in fig .",
    "[ fig8](b ) . the coincidence of our data for @xmath24  for pure o doping and pure sr doping up to @xmath113 is confirmed by a point at @xmath94 taken from ref .  .",
    "in contrast , @xmath11 is significantly larger for a ba - doped sample and shorter for a ca - doped sample , both with @xmath114 . in the case of @xmath109",
    "the @xmath11-axis is about 2.5% shorter than in @xmath24 , but it shows a similar sr doping dependence as @xmath24  at low @xmath115 .",
    "a comparison of the ionic radii of the substituting elements shows that @xmath11 qualitatively scales with the average ionic radii at the la site : @xmath116 .",
    "@xcite therefore , we conclude that the coincidence of @xmath11 for sr and o - doped @xmath24  is accidental .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ( a ) , out of all dopants , interstitial oxygen shows the largest in - plane lattice constants . even for ba , the largest dopant",
    ", @xmath88 stays significantly smaller than for oxygen doping .",
    "we assume that this is due to a large chemical pressure of the intercalated oxygen ions .",
    "interestingly , the ca - doped sample is in line with the sr data , and the data for @xmath36  are just 0.2% lower than for @xmath14 . the fact that , compared to @xmath11 , @xmath88 barely depends on the average ionic radii at the la site shows that the chemical pressure for la site doping is highly anisotropic",
    ". furthermore , we have to conclude that the decrease of @xmath88 upon sr doping is largely due to the dependence of the ni - o bond length upon hole doping .",
    "if this conclusion is correct , then the much weaker decrease of @xmath88 observed for oxygen doping effectively indicates an expansion of the @xmath117-plane by oxygen interstitials . at a hole content of @xmath118",
    ", this expansion amounts to @xmath119% which has to be compared to an expansion of the @xmath11 axis by 1.2% ( see fig .  [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that interstitial oxygens cause an almost isotropic expansion .",
    "we note furthermore , that a strongly anisotropic lattice expansion has also been observed in the lto phase of nd - doped @xmath120 .",
    "@xcite    finally we discuss the change of the slope @xmath90 in fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) at a hole content of @xmath121 .",
    "this effect was also observed by tamura et al . in @xmath4  with @xmath30 .",
    "@xcite there are certainly several factors that contribute to the sr and o doping dependence of @xmath11 .",
    "one factor is the chemical pressure of the dopants , as was discussed above .",
    "next , hole doping leads to a decrease of the sublattice mismatch , which causes the @xmath122 octahedra to straighten up .",
    "this results in an increase of @xmath11 , and further is an additional reason for the stabilization of the htt phase . on the other hand , o and sr doping lead to significant disorder within the octahedral tilts , because the surrounding apical oxygens are pushed away from the defect site ( even in the htt phase ) .",
    "tilt disorder , therefore , effectively causes @xmath11 to decrease .",
    "furthermore , it is assumed that the accompanying disruption of the coherent tilt pattern stabilizes the htt phase , as well",
    ". a closer look at fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) shows that the slope @xmath90 becomes smaller at approximately the hole content where the samples enter the pure htt phase .",
    "at the moment we can not conclusively say whether this effect represents a distinct crossover or a gradual variation .",
    "however , one possible explanation involves the already mentioned contribution coming from a change of the octahedral tilt angle for the coherent tilt pattern .",
    "this contribution is zero in the htt phase and therefore might cause the slower increase of @xmath11 with increasing @xmath12 .",
    "we mention that in @xmath123 , as well , a change of @xmath124 at @xmath125 was observed .",
    "@xcite in @xmath120 , a similar behavior might be related to an increasing concentration of oxygen vacancies for @xmath126 .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , in this compound the feature occurs roughly at the sr - doping - dependent crossover from the lto phase to the htt phase , as well .",
    "in summary , we have presented a detailed x - ray powder diffraction study of sr and o codoped @xmath24  at room temperature . from the lattice parameters we have constructed the oxygen - content phase diagram for each investigated sr content . at low sr concentrations @xmath127",
    "the phase diagrams are qualitatively similar to that for @xmath30 .",
    "however , significant changes occur for @xmath101 where phase separation progressively disappears . we have argued that both the coulomb interaction between the oxygen interstitials and the sr defects , and the reduction of the octahedral tilt angle by sr doping contribute to this effect .",
    "a comparison of the lattice parameters of codoped samples reveals that one has to clearly distinguish between sr and o doping .",
    "furthermore , we have systematically characterized the differences between pure sr and pure o doping , as well as sr - doped samples prepared in air .",
    "a comparison with other dopants shows that the chemical pressure of the la site dopants is strongly anisotropic , while oxygen interstitials exhibit a more isotropic chemical pressure .",
    "finally , this study provides a @xmath128-structure - map which can be used to determine the oxygen content of a sr - doped sample with @xmath115 by measuring the x - ray powder diffraction spectrum .",
    "we acknowledge experimental support from b.  noheda and y.  lee and helpful discussions with p.  desanto .",
    "we are grateful to l. finger for implementation of gplsft for windows xp .",

    "is commonly used for the low - temperature phase with spacegroup @xmath66 in @xmath120  and @xmath14 .",
