    "thus @xmath492    _ notes on the development of the above theorem : _ in the proof of lemma  [ l.d_i ] , and again in the arguments following that proof , it might at first appear that our hypotheses that certain subsets of @xmath14 were infinite ( namely , in the former case , the set of `` next terms '' extending each member of @xmath374 and in the latter , at least one orbit of @xmath8 for each finite set @xmath493 could have been replaced by statements that those sets could be taken to have large enough finite cardinalities , since at each step , we had to make only finitely many choices from these sets , and to avoid only finitely many elements of @xmath11 but closer inspection shows that we dipped into these sets for additional elements infinitely many times . in the proof of lemma  [ l.d_i ] , this is because for fixed @xmath494 there are infinitely many possibilities for @xmath495 and for _ each _ of these , the construction of @xmath496 requires extending the elements @xmath497 to elements of @xmath498 likewise , in ( [ x.g ( ) ] ) , note that @xmath499 and each value of @xmath122 comes up for infinitely many @xmath225 so that for each @xmath122 we must choose , in the long run , elements of @xmath457 having infinitely many different effects on @xmath500    this spreading out of the choices we made from each infinite set , into infinitely many clumps of finitely many choices each , was necessary : if we had made infinitely many choices at one time from one of our sets , we would have had infinitely many obstructions to our choices from the next set , and could not have argued that those choices could be carried out as required .",
    "could the two very similar recursive constructions just referred to have been carried out simultaneously ? in an earlier draft of this note they were .",
    "that arrangement was more efficient ( if less transparent as to what was being proved ) , and could be considered preferable if one had no interest except in closed subgroups .",
    "however , the present development yields the intermediate result lemma  [ l.d_i ] , which can be used to show the @xmath501-equivalence to @xmath6 of many non - closed subgroups for which , so far as we can see , theorem  [ t.inf_orbs ] is of no help .",
    "for example , consider a partition @xmath201 of @xmath14 into a countably infinite family of countably infinite sets @xmath502 and let @xmath7 be the group of permutations of @xmath14 that , for each @xmath335 carry @xmath502 into itself , and move only finitely many elements of that set .",
    "if we choose an arbitrary element @xmath503 and let @xmath504 for each @xmath335 then we see easily that the conditions of lemma  [ l.d_i ] hold , hence that @xmath298    ( the same argument works for the subgroup of the above @xmath7 consisting of those elements @xmath138 for which there is a bound independent of @xmath160 on the number of elements of @xmath328 moved by @xmath505",
    "in this section , we again let @xmath14 be a countably infinite set , and will show that all closed subgroups @xmath506 for which    [ x.unbdd_orbs ] there exists a finite subset @xmath9 such that all orbits of @xmath8 are finite , but no such @xmath12 for which the cardinalities of these orbits have a common finite bound ,    are mutually @xmath501-equivalent .",
    "the approach will parallel that of the preceding section , but there are some complications .    first , there is not one natural subgroup that represents this equivalence class , as @xmath6 represented the class considered in the previous section .",
    "instead we will begin by defining a certain natural family of closed subgroups of @xmath6 which we will prove @xmath501-equivalent to one another .",
    "second , we do not have a result from the literature to serve in the role of  ( [ x.m&n.full ] ) .",
    "so we will prove such a result .",
    "the fact that a finite symmetric group is not its own commutator subgroup will complicate the latter task .",

    "these @xmath1029-cycles lie in @xmath1030 and no point belongs to the support of more than two of them , so we can find an infinite set of @xmath1029-cycles in that group with disjoint supports . by dropping some of these",
    ", we may assume that the complement in @xmath14 of the union of their supports is infinite .",
    "hence we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath1031 and that we have gotten the @xmath1029-cycles @xmath1032 for all @xmath1033 three more conjugations now give us all @xmath1029-cycles of the form @xmath1034 @xmath1035 and these generate @xmath1013 hence @xmath1036 so all subgroups in  ( iii ) are @xmath1007-equivalent to that subgroup , hence to each other , as required .",
    "for @xmath7 in class  ( ii ) , the above result shows that finitely many conjugates of @xmath1037 generate @xmath1038 and since @xmath7 also contains an odd permutation , the corresponding conjugates of @xmath7 generate @xmath1014 so all such groups are @xmath1007-equivalent to @xmath1012 and so again , to each other . that the members of each of ( iv ) , ( v ) , and ( vi ) are mutually @xmath1007-equivalent is easily deduced from standard results about finite symmetric groups @xcite .                the relations @xmath1047 and @xmath1048 tend to be quite fine - grained .",
    "for instance , given partitions @xmath511 and @xmath512 of @xmath1",
    "it is not hard to see that @xmath1049 if and only if @xmath511 and @xmath512 `` disagree at @xmath44 elements '' , meaning that one can be obtained from the other by `` redistributing '' @xmath44 elements of @xmath11    in a different direction , one might define on abstract groups ( rather than subgroups of a fixed group ) a preordering analogous to @xmath1050 by letting @xmath1051 mean that @xmath55 admits an embedding in a group @xmath299 which is generated over @xmath56 by @xmath44 elements .    in our study of symmetric groups in this note ,",
    "we have considered only countable @xmath1 except when no additional work or distraction was entailed by allowing greater generality .",
    "it would be of interest to know what can be said about @xmath1052-equivalence classes of closed subgroups of @xmath31 for general @xmath14 and @xmath1053 in particular , whether there are simple criteria for a closed subgroup @xmath32 to be @xmath241-equivalent ( equivalently , @xmath1054-equivalent ) to @xmath1055    a related topic which has been studied extensively ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) is the _ cofinality _ of groups @xmath90 defined as the least cardinal @xmath40 such that @xmath31 can be written as the union of a chain of @xmath44 proper subgroups . if @xmath0 is of cofinality @xmath206 then our unary relation @xmath1056 is equivalent to @xmath1057 ( cf .",
