    "consider a social network in which each individual is friends with zero or more other individuals . in a vector model of the network ,",
    "an individual @xmath3 is described by a @xmath1-dimensional vector  @xmath2 for some integer @xmath11 that expresses the extent to which  @xmath3 has each of a set of @xmath1 attributes ( which might , for example , represent their hobbies , political opinions or musical tastes ) . then two individuals are assumed to be friends if and only if their attributes are `` sufficiently similar '' .",
    "there are many ways to measure similarity using a vector model ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we use the _ dot product model _ : two individuals  @xmath3 and  @xmath4 are friends if and only if the dot product @xmath5 , for some fixed , positive threshold  @xmath6 .",
    "the corresponding graph  @xmath12 , in which each individual is a vertex and the friendship relation is described by the edge set , is called a _ dot product graph _ of _ dimension _ @xmath1 or a _ @xmath1-dot product graph_. we also say that the vector model @xmath13 with the threshold  @xmath6 is a _ @xmath1-dot product representation _ of  @xmath12 .",
    "dot product graphs have been studied from various perspectives . in particular , the study of dot product graphs as a model for social networks was initiated in a randomized setting  @xcite , where the dot product of two vectors gives the probability that an edge occurs between the corresponding vertices . in a recent paper  @xcite , we started the study of dot product graphs from an algorithmic perspective by considering the problems of finding a maximum independent set or a maximum clique in a @xmath1-dot product graph .",

    "@xcite initiated a study of dot product graphs from a graph - theoretic perspective .",
    "they showed that every graph on @xmath14 vertices and @xmath15 edges has a dot product representation of dimension at most the minimum of @xmath16 and @xmath15 .",
    "they also introduced the natural notion of the _ dot product dimension _ of a graph , which is the smallest @xmath1 such that the graph has a @xmath1-dot product representation .",
    "graphs of dot product dimension  @xmath17 are easily understood and can be recognized in polynomial time : they are precisely the disjoint union of at most two threshold graphs  @xcite .",
    "this situation changes for higher values of the dot product dimension .",
    "kang and mller  @xcite proved that recognizing graphs of any fixed dot product dimension @xmath8 is @xmath7-hard .",
    "however , membership in @xmath18 is still open for @xmath8 and , in fact , we know comparatively little about graphs of dot product dimension @xmath10 ( or any higher fixed value ) .",
    "in particular , we lack an in - depth understanding of how @xmath10-dot product graphs fit within the landscape of known graph classes .",

    "@xcite proved that every interval graph and every caterpillar is a @xmath10-dot product graph ; note that not all @xmath10-dot product graphs are interval graphs ( as the cycle on four vertices is a @xmath10-dot product graph but not an interval graph ) .",

    "chordal  graphs are known to have dot product dimension at most @xmath20  @xcite .    since there exist trees of dot product dimension @xmath19 , neither all outerplanar nor all planar graphs are @xmath10-dot product graphs . however ,",
    "kang  et al .",
    "@xcite proved tight bounds of  @xmath19 and  @xmath21 , respectively , on the dot product dimension of these graphs ; they also showed that every planar graph of girth at least  5 is has dot product dimension @xmath19 and that this does not hold if the girth is  4 .",
    "li and chang  @xcite showed that every wheel on six or more vertices has dot product dimension  @xmath19 ( a _ wheel _ is a graph obtained from a cycle by adding a dominating vertex ) .",
    "fiduccia et al .",
    "@xcite proved that every bipartite graph has dot product dimension at most @xmath22 and that this a tight bound , since the complete bipartite graph @xmath23 on @xmath24 vertices has dot product dimension @xmath14 .",
    "in fact , they conjectured that any graph on @xmath14 vertices has dot product dimension at most @xmath22 .",
    "li and chang  @xcite confirmed this conjecture for chordal graphs , graphs with girth at least  5 , and @xmath25-sparse graphs .",
    "observe that , in spite of these results , there are still many graph classes for which the relation to the class of graphs of small dot product dimension ( and of dot product dimension @xmath10 in particular ) is unclear .",
    "we provide a more complete picture of the place of @xmath10-dot product graphs in the landscape of known graph classes . to this end , we identify several new graph classes that are @xmath10-dot product graphs .",
    "we also show that certain graph classes are neither contained in the class of @xmath10-dot product graphs nor do they contain all @xmath10-dot product graphs .",
    "in particular , our work provides evidence that no well - known graph class includes all @xmath10-dot product graphs ( however , we note explicitly here that we neither claim nor conjecture this ) .",
    "in section  [ subsec : obs ] we state several observations on @xmath10-dot product graphs .",
    "then , in section  [ s - com ] , we consider _ co - bipartite graphs _ ( complements of bipartite graphs ) : a complete graph minus a matching remains a @xmath10-dot product graph , but we show that there exist co - bipartite graphs with dot product dimension greater than  @xmath10 .",

    "we prove that not all unit circular - arc graphs have dot product dimension  @xmath10 , but give sufficient conditions for them to have dot product dimension  @xmath10 . in the same section",
    ", we also show that unit disk graphs may not have dot product dimension @xmath10 , but do have dot product dimension at most @xmath19 . note that the latter bound is sharp , as the 6-wheel , which has dot product dimension  3  @xcite , is a unit disk graph ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , in section  [ s - split ] , we consider _ split graphs _ ; that is , graphs whose vertices can be partitioned into two sets that induce an independent set and a clique .",
    "we show the existence of split graphs with dot product dimension greater than  2 .",
    "we start by observing that because the class of 2-dot product graphs is closed under vertex deletion , it can be characterized by a set of forbidden induced subgraphs .",
    "however , the class of @xmath10-dot product graphs is not well - quasi - ordered , that is , it has no _ finite _ set of forbidden induced subgraphs , because every wheel must be in this set of forbidden induced subgraphs . indeed ,",
    "a wheel minus a vertex is either a cycle or a fan , and thus has dot product dimension  @xmath10 .",
    "we note that @xmath10-dot product graphs are not necessarily triangle - free , planar , nor @xmath27-minor - free for some fixed @xmath27 , as they can contain arbitrarily large cliques .",
    "they are also not necessarily split , at - free , even hole - free , or odd hole - free , because cycles of any length are @xmath10-dot product ( see  @xcite for cycles of length 4 or length at least  6 ; for the @xmath28-vertex cycle this follows from li and chang s result  @xcite on graphs with girth at least  5 ) .",

    "@xmath30 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) , nor circular - arc ( for example , take the complete graph on four vertices and add a pendant vertex to each vertex ) . moreover , there exist 2-dot product graphs that are not a disk graph ( take the bi-4-wheel which can be represented as @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 with @xmath37 ) .",
    "we note that grid graphs are not 2-dot product , as the @xmath38 grid can easily be shown not to have a @xmath10-dot product representation by following the proof for wheels in  @xcite . because @xmath39 has a @xmath10-dot product representation , we know that 2-dot product graphs are not necessarily perfect graphs , nor even circular perfect .",
    "we need some definitions and four lemmas , some of which are known already .",
    "we say that a vertex @xmath4 is _ between _ vertices @xmath3 and @xmath40 if @xmath41 can be written as a nonnegative linear combination of @xmath42 and @xmath43 . in other words , @xmath4 is between @xmath3 and @xmath40 if @xmath44 lies in the plane defined by @xmath45 and @xmath46 and @xmath41 lies within the smaller of the two angles defined by @xmath42 and @xmath41 in this plane .",

    "since @xmath142 , @xmath148 is properly defined .",
    "now observe that if @xmath145 and @xmath149 intersect , then the angle between @xmath144 and @xmath150 is at most @xmath151 .",
    "hence , @xmath152 if @xmath145 and @xmath149 do not intersect , then the angle between @xmath144 and @xmath150 is larger than @xmath151 .",
    "hence , @xmath153 it follows that the intersection graph @xmath12 of @xmath154 is isomorphic to the dot product graph of @xmath148 .",
    "since the vectors in @xmath148 lie in @xmath155 , the dot product dimension of @xmath12 is at most @xmath140 .",
    "it would seem that theorem  [ thm : unitcap ] also implies that all unit circular - arc graphs have dot product dimension at most  @xmath10 .",
    "however , due to the limited angular diameter allowed in our definition of unit caps , this implication only holds if the graph has a unit circular - arc representation using unit caps of @xmath157 .",
    "this is the case , for example , when the graph has no maximal independent set of size less than  4 .",
    "a cap of @xmath158 is essentially equal to an arc of the circle .",
    "our definition of unit caps limits the angular diameter of unit caps to at most @xmath159 , that is , unit arcs that each cover at most @xmath160 of the circle .",
    "so in order for the proof to work , we need to ensure that the unit arcs in a representation of the unit circular - arc graph each cover at most @xmath160 of the circle .",
    "this is guaranteed to be the case , for example , when the graph has no maximal independent set of size less than  4 ( if the graph has a maximal independent set of size  4 or more , then necessarily each arc covers less than @xmath160 of the circle .    surprisingly , the restriction on the size of a maximal independent set in theorem  [ t - independentset ] is not an artifact of our proof technique , but is actually needed : in figure  [ fig : circ ] is an example of a graph @xmath161 that is a unit circular - arc graph and that has dot product dimension larger than  2 ( this will be shown in the proof of theorem  [ l - main2dot ] ) .",
