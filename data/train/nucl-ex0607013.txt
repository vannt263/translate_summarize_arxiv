    "based on the assumption that @xmath4 pairs are created in primordial hard nucleon - nucleon collisions only ( due to the large mass of the charm quark ) , @xmath0 s suppression by color screening in a deconfined medium  @xcite is suggested to be used as a signature of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation in the relativistic heavy ion collisions . however , at rhic energies , up to @xmath5 - 20  @xmath4 pairs can be created in the most central @xmath2 collisions .",
