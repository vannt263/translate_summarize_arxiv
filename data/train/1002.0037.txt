    "<S> we measure the temperature of a mesoscopic system consisting of an ultra - dilute two dimensional electron gas at the @xmath0 interface in a metal - oxide - semiconductor field effect transistor ( mosfet ) by means of the capture and emission of an electron in a point defect close to the interface . </S>",
    "<S> contrarily to previous reports , we show that the capture and emission by point defects in si n - mosfets can be temperature dependent down to 800 mk . as the finite quantum grand canonical ensemble applies , the time domain charge fluctuation in the defect is used to define the temperature of the few electron gas in the channel .    </S>",
    "<S> we create a mesoscopic system made of a quantum gas of few electrons in thermal and particle exchange with a point defect capable of containing one or two electrons , for which a generalized temperature is determined by virtue of the finite quantum grand partition ensemble .    </S>",
    "<S> nanoelectronics @xcite and the study of mesoscopic systems in solid state devices at low temperature @xcite consider ensembles of small numbers of interacting particles . a single donor atom in a semiconductor @xcite , defects @xcite , and quantum dots @xcite may contain one or two localized electrons . </S>",
    "<S> these electrons are in thermal contact with a thermal bath consisting of a two or three dimensional electron system confined in the leads or in a nanometric channel . there , the total number of electrons may be of the order of tens up to several hundreds . </S>",
    "<S> temperature is defined by the inverse of the partial derivative of the energy with respect to the entropy , at a fixed volume @xcite . unlike in macroscopic system , for which the number of electrons in the reservoir is infinite and conventional statistical physics holds , the temperature of a mesoscopic system consisting of few electrons confined in a nanostructure is defined by virtue of a time domain extension of the grand canonical ensemble in the limit of small finite @xmath1 @xcite . a system constituted by a refrigerated </S>",
    "<S> ultra - dilute two dimensional electron gas at the si / sio@xmath2 interface in a metal - oxide - semiconductor field - effect - transistor ( mosfet ) and a zero dimensional defect located at the interface realizes an experimental condition well described by the finite quantum grand canonical ensemble.@xcite the point defect can exchange one electron with the two dimensional system by a thermally assisted tunneling .    </S>",
    "<S> capture and emission of a single electron by defects are monitored by the current fluctuactions through the channel of the mosfet . </S>",
    "<S> such effect goes under the name of random telegraph signal ( rts ) @xcite , because of the peculiar bi - stable current values flowing randomly as a function of time . in conventional theory of rts , </S>",
    "<S> the same temperature is attributed to the lattice and to the electrons . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the temperature has been previously extracted from the dependence of @xmath3 from a static magnetic field in the case of an infinite thermal bath of electrons in the channel.@xcite    we report on the experimental determination of the generalized temperature of a mesoscopic ensemble of few electrons , for which the generalized temperature is defined by means of the finite quantum grand canonical ensemble.@xcite first , we demonstrate that the detailed balance principle holds below 10 k by measuring the temperature dependence of the occupancy probability of defect at the @xmath0 interface , contrarily to previous reported experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> next , we experimentally determine the generalized temperature of the system constituted by the electrons confined in a defect and the ultra - dilute 2-dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) .    the experiment was carried in a n - channel mos device having a length of 180 nm and a width of 280 nm , gate oxide thickness of 3.5 nm and a threshold voltage at 4.2 k of @xmath4= 490 mv.@xcite the drain current @xmath5 was measured by a transimpedance amplifier with bandwidth from dc to about 10 khz . </S>",
    "<S> the electronics is powered by independent batteries to avoid power - line pick ups and interferences , while the sample was controlled by a 12 bits data acquisition board . </S>",
    "<S> the drain and gate voltages can be set with a resolution better than 50 @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this setup allowed us to characterize traps with a characteristic time down to 100 @xmath7s . </S>",
    "<S> the sample was immersed in liquid @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we measured the sample at a temperature below 10 k down to the base temperature of 290 mk . in order to deal with a small number of identical particles , an electron system confined at the interface between si and </S>",
    "<S> the sio@xmath2 has been obtained by cooling a mosfet polarized close to the threshold voltage @xmath4 down to the nominal temperature of @xmath9 mk . </S>",
    "<S> the number of electrons in the 2deg has been roughly estimated by the charge stored in the mos capacitor : @xmath10 , where @xmath11,@xmath12 are the width and length of the transistor and @xmath13 the oxide thickness . by working few mv above the threshold voltage , </S>",
    "<S> a number of electrons in the order @xmath14 has been obtained . in confirmation of the low number of electrons , the charge transport at gate voltages close to the threshold @xmath15 exhibits coulomb blockade characteristics ( figure 1 ) typical of sequential tunneling through a few electron quantum dot starting from @xmath16.@xcite the current flows through an electrostatic island placed between the source and the drain . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that transport is affected by rts at small bias and close to the threshold . </S>",
    "<S> we model the system constituted by the quantum dot formed in the channel and the interface defect as depicted in figure 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the defect exchanges one electron with the channel partially formed below the gate at one side of the electron island . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with previously reported results @xcite , the random telegraph signal in the n - mosfet was found to be temperature dependent far below 10 k. in figure 3 the exponential trend of the ratio of the measured emission time @xmath17 and capture time @xmath18 is reported between 0.6 k and 1.75 k. the ratio @xmath19 depends exponentially on the inverse of the nominal temperature @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the principle of detailed balance holds in the temperature range considered . </S>",
    "<S> the heating of the electron gas was minimized by applying a small bias in the proximity of the threshold voltage . </S>",
    "<S> the current is of the order of few na . </S>",
    "<S> this aspect represents the major difference between our experiment and those reported in the ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite where the current was of the order of @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> we measured the effective generalized temperature of the electron gas by studying the b field dependence of the ratio between the occupancies in the time domain . </S>",
    "<S> the trap is a paramagnetic center with one unpaired electron , capable of capturing and emitting a second electron ( 1@xmath222 ) . </S>",
    "<S> such conclusion is provided by the measurement of the characteristic times @xmath23 ( capture ) and @xmath24 ( emission ) as a function of the gate voltage @xmath25 and of the magnetic field up to 3 t at the nominal temperature of 310 mk.@xcite the ratio between the probabilities of realization of one and two particles occupancy of a mesoscopic system constituted by a cell in thermal and particle exchange with a few electron gas of @xmath1 identical particles at the generalized temperature @xmath26 is described by the equation @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath7 is the chemical potential , @xmath29 is the charging energy when two electrons occupy the point defect , @xmath30 is the energy gain of the lattice when the second electron is captured , and @xmath1 is the number of electrons of the dilute gas.@xcite the expression eq . </S>",
    "<S> 1 follows from the experimental details of the mechanisms involved in low temperature rts . at low temperature the 2des </S>",
    "<S> is weakly coupled with the crystal @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> phonons are involved in the emission and capture of one electron from the defect and the relaxation of the crystal implies a change of energy of @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the huang - rhys factor and @xmath33 is the average phonon frequency in the configuration coordinate picture @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we identify the energy gain of the lattice when an electron is captured with the huang - rhys factor @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly to the charging energy @xmath29 of the electrostatic potential of the defect , @xmath30 can be accounted for a negative variation of the electron system gibbs free energy . under the ergodic assumption </S>",
    "<S> , the ratio between the average occupation times equals the ratio between the occupation probabilities , so the experimentally accessible characteristic times provide information on the statistics via : @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath36 experimentally observed as a function of the magnetic field @xmath37 is reported in figure 4 . </S>",
    "<S> the deviation from a pure exponential trend with respect to the @xmath37 field reveals that both the singlet and the triplet states are accessible at sufficiently high magnetic field.@xcite the contribution of the energy shift from the single electron occupancy to the two electrons occupancy of the point defect @xmath38 is temperature independent . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the magnetic field dependence of @xmath36 is similar to that presented in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the degeneracy factor , @xmath41 is the average value of the two zeeman splittings of the channel and of the trap respectively , @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the energy gap between the singlet and the triplet energy levels in the doubly occupied defect . </S>",
    "<S> the generalized temperature for such system extracted from the fitting is @xmath44 k. @xmath43=150(5 ) @xmath7ev is due to the different charging energy caused by the different orbital symmetry of the electron wavefunction for the singlet and the triplet states . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the generalized electron temperature and the lattice temperature which is in thermal equilibrium with the @xmath8 at 310 mk is consistent with other reported values in similar systems . to conclude , we experimentally determined the generalized temperature of a system of few electrons at cryogenic temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that below 10 k the capture and the emission of a point defect may be thermally activated and we discussed the role of phonons . </S>",
    "<S> we realized such mesoscopic system in a n - mosfet , where a point defect exchanges one electron with the 2des at the si / sio@xmath2 interface . </S>",
    "<S> the generalized temperature is extracted from the probability of occupation of a mesoscopic system constituted by a point defect capable of containing either 1 or 2 electrons in thermal contact with a dilute electron system , in the limit of finite @xmath1 , with the help of a static magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this method provides an estimate of the temperature of a system consisting of a localized electron in thermal exchange with a small number of electrons confined in two dimensions .    </S>",
