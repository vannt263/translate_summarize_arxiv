    "we shall see that the suggested identification with the continuum limit of the spin chain can be maintained , but some of the lattice results receive an interesting reinterpretation .",
    "let us begin by reviewing briefly some results on the spectrum of the lattice model .",
    "in @xcite it was found analytically that this spectrum exhibits a unique ground state at @xmath305 , which lies in the single `` true singlet '' of the model , i.e.  it is a @xmath15 invariant state that is not part of a larger indecomposable representation .",

    "formula ( [ gaps ] ) indicates an infinite degeneracy of the level @xmath310 ( obtained with @xmath311 say ) in the limit @xmath312 .",
    "numerical studies confirm this behavior : indeed , they show that that an infinite number of levels converges to @xmath310 as @xmath313 increases .",
    "this was already interpreted in @xcite as indicating the existence of a continuum of conformal weights starting at @xmath310 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "although an analytical study of the asymptotic corrections to ( [ gaps ] ) seems still out of reach , numerical studies in a closely related model suggest that the leading contributions to @xmath314 and @xmath315 can be well fitted by the formulas @xmath316 for large number @xmath317 of lattice sites .",
    "when these leading terms are plugged back into the formula ( [ gaps ] ) for the spectrum of the lattice model , we see that the second line resembles very much the spectrum of a free boson which has been compactified to a circle with radius square of the order @xmath318 . in other words , if we assume that eqs .",
    "( [ gapsfit ] ) are correct , the contribution from the `` antisymmetric sector '' ( i.e.  form excitations for which @xmath319 or @xmath320 are non zero ) to the partition function can be estimated as @xmath321       & = &       \\frac{r } { \\sqrt{2}}\\frac{1 } {       \\sqrt{\\hbox{im } \\tau}\\ \\eta\\bar{\\eta}}\\ \\sum_{m , m ' }     \\ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi       r^{2}|m\\tau - m'|^{2 } } { 2\\hbox{im } \\tau}\\right )     \\nonumber\\\\[2 mm ]       & \\approx & \\frac{r } { \\sqrt{2 } }       \\frac{1 } {       \\sqrt{\\hbox{im } \\tau}\\eta\\bar{\\eta } }       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath322 is dedekind s eta function , as before .",
    "the divergence is proportional to @xmath269 , i.e.  to the size of the target space , as expected .",
    "we conclude that in the lattice model , the contribution from the antisymmetric sector to the partition function multiplies the contribution from the symmetric sector in eq .",
    "( [ gaps ] ) by a term of the order of @xmath323 .",

    "the generating function of levels in the periodic sector will therefore have the form @xmath324\\ ] ] where the dots represent excitations from the symmetric sector in ( [ gaps ] ) .",
    "the first conclusion we draw is that the contribution of the continuum completely overrides the one from the discrete state ( as would be the case in any quantum mechanics problem with discrete states and a continuum with delta function normalizable states ) , and that a properly normalized partition function does not see the singlet with @xmath305 .",
    "the resulting object is in good agreement with our conjectured partition function ( [ conj ] ) .",
    "reference @xcite contained various failed attempts to build a conformal field theory containing both the continuum of representations @xmath325 and a single identity field associated with the representation @xmath104 .",
    "given our new insight into the continuum model , the problems to incorporate the singlet state may not come as a complete surprise . although the free field construction at @xmath2 suggests the possibility of smaller theories , the study of modular invariants ( as well as of four point functions , as we mentioned above ) seems to preclude the appearance of the singlet representation on its own - i.e.  without being part of a big indecomposable with vanishing super - dimension .",
    "in addition all the states we found in the continuum approach were non normalizable .",
    "both observations lead us to speculate that eq .",
    "( [ conj ] ) represents the full operator content of the continuum limit , and that there is no discrete state associated with a true singlet .",
    "put differently , the new investigation suggests that the true singlet observed on the lattice is an artifact of the regularization and does not belong to the continuum limit .",
    "our new interpretation of the lattice results receives additional support from the very singular nature of the bethe ansatz solution that corresponds to the singlet state .",
    "it would be interesting to check further the decoupling of the true singlet by studying the scaling behavior of matrix elements of lattice regularized current algebra generators .",
    "there is one more potential objection one might raise .",
    "note that in our continuum theory fermionic and bosonic states are perfectly paired so that the witten index of the @xmath0 wznw model is guaranteed to vanish .",
    "meanwhile , for our lattice spin chain on the space @xmath301 one finds an excess by one for the number of bosonic states over the number of fermionic ones .",
    "hence , the witten index is non - zero on the lattice and one would naively expect the same to be true for the continuum limit , in conflict with what we have proposed above . in order to resolve this issue",
    ", we suggest that there exist different spin chains which give rise to the same continuum limit while possessing an excess of fermionic states over bosonic . more concretely , while we do not understand the whole structure yet , we have found that the ground states of integrable chains of the type @xmath326 and @xmath327 scale to conformal weight @xmath149 as well ( in fact the ground state energy is given exactly by @xmath328 where @xmath329 has no finite size correction and is the same for all chains ) , but this time they come in the representation @xmath302 ( resp .",
    "@xmath330 ) .",
    "once we sum over the various lattice models , the balance between bosonic and fermionic states may be restored even before taking the continuum limit .",
    "our investigation above was restricted to integer level @xmath111 .",
    "but as we have mentioned before , these are some fractional values of @xmath111 , in particular @xmath4 , which play an important role for applications .",
    "while we are not prepared to give a systematic account on fractional level theories , we would like to discuss briefly a model with @xmath4 .",
    "our analysis will lead to the remarkable conclusion that the basic structure of this model is essentially the same as for integer @xmath111 , only that there exist several components within the atypical sector , each of them being modeled after @xmath94 .    in this case",
    "@xmath4 , the relevant representation theory of the @xmath15 current algebra is particularly simple .",
    "in fact , all relevant representations can be obtained from the vacuum sector @xmath331 through application of spectral flow symmetries .",
    "it is not difficult to show that at @xmath4 the automorphism @xmath332 is inner , i.e.  @xmath333 .",
    "this means that application of @xmath332 does not lead to any new representations .",

    "in fact , the fusion product simply amounts to a composition of the associated automorphism .    with the exception of the sectors labeled by @xmath338 , the representations @xmath339 do not contain a highest or lowest weight .",
    "the representation @xmath340 is to be identified with the vacuum representation .",
    "@xmath341 is the only other admissible representation at @xmath4 .",
    "it is generated from the 4-dimensional typical multiplet @xmath261 of ground states with conformal weight @xmath342 .",
    "in addition , there are four more highest / lowest weight weight representations which are erected over the atypical discrete series representations @xmath343 and @xmath344 corresponding to a negative spin @xmath345 .",

    "if we do not include the symplectic fermions ( note that once more the currents only involve derivatives ) , but only their derivatives then the state space reads @xmath356 since the spectral flow automorphisms @xmath166 and @xmath189 correspond to multiplication with the fields @xmath357 is is fairly easy to write down at least one field in each sector of the model , @xmath358 the space @xmath359 contains r sector representations only , but it is certainly possible to include the ns sector by adding the image under the spectral flow @xmath212 .",
    "since this works just in the same way as above , we shall not repeat the discussion here .",
    "even though all the representations we are working with are atypical , the state space decomposes into irreducible building blocks .",
    "this is quite different from the structure of the atypical sectors @xmath208 we described above . on the other hand ,",
    "is is very similar to one of the consistent theories with @xmath2 that we described at the end of section 4.2 . in the @xmath2 theory , the singular vectors of the indecomposable block @xmath208 were decoupled by restricting to a theory that contained only derivatives of the fermionic fields .",
    "conversely , the experience from @xmath2 suggest that in the @xmath4 case we may be able to construct a theory with a more complicated atypical sector by including one or both of the symplectic fermion fields @xmath253 and @xmath258 @xcite .    we claim that in case we include both fermionic zero modes we end up with an atypical structure that decomposes into four different blocks , each of them being built in the same way as our sector @xmath208 .",
    "we shall present the analysis only for the block that contains the vacuum sector @xmath360 .",
    "the other three sectors are obtained by acting with @xmath361 and @xmath362 .",
    "let us start our discussion with the field @xmath363 .",
    "any action with @xmath364 and @xmath20 will remove one of the two fermionic zero modes and hence @xmath365 sits at the top of a sector @xmath360 .",
    "the action of @xmath366 and @xmath367 takes us from here into a set of fields which all contain a factor @xmath253 .",
    "these fields can be shown to belong to a sector that is isomorphic to @xmath368 .",
    "further application of @xmath369 and @xmath370 bring us to a set of fields that contain only derivatives of fermions .",
    "these form a subrepresentation @xmath331 at the bottom of our atypical representation .",
    "a similar analysis applies if we act with @xmath369 and @xmath370 first .",
    "this time , we descend to @xmath331 via the sector @xmath371 .",
    "continuing along this line of thoughts , one can see that the sectors @xmath372 form the composition series for an indecomposable representation @xmath208 with @xmath373 in place of @xmath374 .",
    "the state space of the maximal theory therefore decomposes into four indecomposable blocks .",
    "once more , there are two intermediate theories , each of which has four saw - blade shaped atypical sectors .",
    "they are obtained if we omit either @xmath253 or @xmath258 ( but not their derivatives , of course ) from the above maximal theory .    even though we are not prepared to analyze wznw models for generic fractional levels , it is remarkable that the structure we have first uncovered in our minisuperspace limit , re - appears even for @xmath375 .",
    "it seems very likely that the same is true for a generic choice of the level .",
    "an obvious conclusion of our study is that wznw models on supergroups are interesting examples of logarithmic cfts , much richer than it has been anticipated in earlier works .",
    "gurarie ( see @xcite and references therein ) , for instance , argued that super wznw models with @xmath309 could be considered as made of two `` decoupled '' component theories with opposite values of the central charge , an observation justified in part by the fact that in the gl(1@xmath111 ) wznw model , the stress energy tensor belongs naturally to a four dimensional gl(1@xmath111 ) multiplet in which @xmath376 is diagonalizable , and hence @xmath377 has no `` non trivial logarithmic partner '' .",
    "the su(2@xmath111 ) wznw clearly does not obey any such decoupling .",
    "in fact , restricting to the right moving current algebra as in @xcite we see that the identity field belongs to a projective representation of the zero mode algebra on which the casimir - and hence @xmath376 - is not diagonalizable . applying @xmath378 to this representation",
    "produces a virasoro jordan cell at level @xmath379 and a non trivial logarithmic partner of the stress energy tensor .",
    "this can be seen quite explicitely in the case @xmath2 where , within the free field representation ( and similarly to the case of symplectic fermions ) , the field @xmath380 is a logarithmic partner of @xmath381 note that the whole structure of indecomposables is in fact much more complicated than envisioned in @xcite when the interplay of left and right current algebras is taken into account .",
    "even though the structure of the state space is rather difficult when analyzed with respect to the combined left and right action , it is surprisingly simple once we restrict to either the left or the right action alone .",
    "note that the lie superalgebra @xmath15 has a large number of indecomposables ( see e.g. @xcite ) from which only a very distinguished sub - class does actually occur within the state space of our model . in fact ,",
    "we have seen above that all states ( both in the minisuperspace theory and the full field theory ) transform according to the so - called projective representations of @xmath15 , i.e.  either in typicals and projective covers of atypicals .",
    "this is not to say , however , that other representations of @xmath15 have no relevance for sigma models on supergroups .",
    "in addition to the left and right regular representation there is yet one more important symmetry that arises from the adjoint action of @xmath15 on the state space . with respect to the latter",
    ", states can transform in other indecomposables .",
    "the underlying mathematical structure turns out to be quite intriguing and will be described elsewhere .",
    "since the adjoint action is left unbroken by maximally symmetric boundary conditions , the resulting decomposition should have applications , in particular to the study of boundary conditions for sigma models on supergroups .    as a final comment",
    "let us point out one generic feature we have encountered in both @xmath14 and @xmath0 , namely that the contribution of the indecomposable sector @xmath94 simply makes up for the subtractions in the atypical sectors of the theory , so that the partition function sees only contributions from kac modules , and has a simple factorized form .",
    "this behavior is sufficient for a modular invariant partition function but it is not necessary .",
    "the potential existence of different versions of the theory where only parts of the complex @xmath94 appear , requires more study .",
    "we note that some hints in this direction are provided by the study of four point functions . in the case",
    "@xmath2 , the four point function of the fields in the @xmath261 representation has been studied in detail .",
    "it turns out that the kz equations factorize , and that it is possible to decouple one conformal block .",
    "two blocks remain , leading to logarithmic dependence , and indicating that the identity field remains part of an indecomposable representation .",
    "this suggests that the smallest theory , where the complex @xmath94 is reduced to an infinite sum of irreducibles , can not appear in the @xmath15 wznw model . in the case",
    "@xmath4 meanwhile it is possible to decouple two conformal blocks , leaving only the identity field , and indicating that the smallest theory does make sense this time - a feature consistent with the free field representation and the modular invariant .",
    "the @xmath15 wznw model at fractional level and the explicit construction of consistent theories with a truncated atypical sector certainly deserve a more systematic investigation .",
