    "recent data from type ia supernovae ( snia ) @xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite and large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite all point to the fact that the universe has recently entered into a stage of accelerated expansion .",
    "this is an unexpected and revolutionary discovery that calls for new physics , since gravity is always an attractive force .",
    "the simplest possibility to explain the acceleration of the universe is to postulate the existence of a cosmological constant of the right magnitude . while this assumption is still compatible with all available data , it is unsatisfactory on the grounds of the huge amount of fine tuning required . hence , exploratory models with scalar fields possessing a varying non - zero vacuum energy density , usually called quintessence models @xcite , have been studied as an alternative to the cosmological constant solution .",
    "one of the most important tasks ahead of observational cosmology is to devise methods and gather data to successfully and unequivocally distinguish between these two possibilities . finding evidence for an evolving vacuum energy would be one of the greatest discoveries of the century .",
    "what is the appropriate scalar potential that could reproduce the observed data ? there has been a large number of papers dealing with the possibility of reconstructing the potential directly from the data @xcite and it is fair to say that any statement about the form of the potential depends upon some level of parameterization .",
    "the procedure has also been extended to reconstruct the potential and the form of the scalar - gravity coupling in the jordan frame of a scalar - tensor gravity theory from data on luminosity distance and linear density perturbation @xcite .",
    "more recently guo , ohta and zhang @xcite studied the reconstruction of the scalar potential directly from parameterizations of the equation of state .",
    "an intriguing possibility is that the scalar field is not totally decoupled from our world @xcite .",
    "although the coupling to baryonic matter is severely constrained , it is still possible to allow for a coupling to non - baryonic dark matter . from a lagrangian point of view , these couplings could be of the form @xmath0 or @xmath1 for a fermionic or bosonic dark matter represented by @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , where the function @xmath4 of the quintessence field @xmath5 can in principle be arbitrary . in this scenario ,",
    "the mass of the dark matter particles evolves according to some function of the dark energy field @xmath5 , leading to an effective equation - of - state for the dark matter .",
    "i will consider exploratory models for dark energy with a canonical scalar field coupled to dark matter .",
    "the lagrangian for this class of models is specified by the choice of two functions of the scalar field : the scalar field potential @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the function that characterizes the coupling to dark matter .",
    "specific forms for the scalar potential and for the interaction , such as power - law or exponential functions , have been extensively studied in the literature @xcite .    however , instead of postulating a concrete model by choosing definite parametric forms for @xmath6 and @xmath7 , it is often more convenient and completely equivalent to introduce a time - dependent parameterization for the dark energy equation of state @xmath8 and for a coupling function @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the scale factor of the universe .",
    "in fact , this approach is widely used in the uncoupled case in order to test for the time - variation of dark energy since it is much easier to compare to snia observations @xcite . for the coupled case",
    ", an analysis of the impact of interactions on snia observations was performed using a specific coupling either in the einstein @xcite or jordan @xcite frame of a scalar - tensor theory .",
    "more recently , parameterizations of @xmath8 and @xmath9 were directly used to study the effects of de - dm interactions on fits from snia data @xcite .    given a parameterization for @xmath8 and @xmath9 with parameters fitted by observations ,",
    "it is important to investigate the shape of the potential and interaction functions that results in those parameterizations .",
    "they define the fundamental model behind the parameterizations . in this article",
    "i will show how to reconstruct the scalar potential and the interaction from the general parameterized forms of the dark energy equation of state @xmath8 and a coupling function @xmath9 and provide a few concrete examples .",
    "the reconstruction program proposed here generalizes the one first developed by ellis and madsen @xcite .",
    "i consider a spatially flat universe composed of three perfect fluids , namely dark energy , non - baryonic dark matter and baryons . the dark matter and baryons",
    "are non - relativistic pressureless fluids and einstein s equations result in : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and the dark energy is described by a scalar field @xmath5 with energy density and pressure given by : @xmath13 with a equation of state @xmath14 defined by @xmath15 .",
    "conservation of the stress - energy tensor requires that the total energy density and pressure obey : @xmath16 introducing the coupling function @xmath9 between dark energy and dark matter as @xmath17 results in the following equation for the evolution of the dm energy density @xmath18 @xcite : @xmath19 also , conservation of baryon number requires : @xmath20 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhototal ] ) then implies that the dark energy density should obey @xmath21    notice that the parameterization eq .  ( [ eq : delta ] ) implies @xmath22 normalized such that @xmath23 .    combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rhophi],[rhode],[eq : wreconstruction ] ) one obtains a modified klein - gordon equation for the scalar field : @xmath24 in agreement with das , corasaniti and khoury @xcite .",
    "one can now proceed to reconstruct the potential and the interaction for a given parameterization of the equation of state @xmath25 and the interaction @xmath9 .",
    "the first step is to find the time variation of dark matter energy density , which is easily obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ rhodm ] ) : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the non - baryonic dm energy density today .",
    "it is more useful to work with the variable @xmath28 , and one can write @xmath29 the second step is to substitute @xmath30 into eq .",
    "( [ rhode ] ) , which in terms of @xmath31 reads : @xmath32 where @xmath33 , and find a solution @xmath34 with initial condition @xmath35 , with @xmath36 being the dark energy density today .    in the third step one",
    "constructs the hubble parameter : @xmath37 where @xmath38 , the critical density today is @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the hubble constant . the function @xmath41 that determines the evolution of the dark energy density is in general obtained numerically .",
    "having obtained the hubble parameter , the fourth step consists in solving the evolution equation for the scalar field obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : einstein],[eq : rhophi ] ) : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the scalar field in units of the planck mass ( @xmath44 ) and @xmath45 in the fifth step one numerically inverts the solution @xmath46 in order to determine @xmath47 to finally obtain @xmath48 and @xmath49 this completes the reconstruction procedure .",
    "i will now work out some examples of this procedure .",
    "i adopt @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 in the following . in all examples",
    "i integrate the field equation starting from @xmath53 , corresponding to @xmath54 and i arbitrarily set @xmath55 .",
    "i start by considering the simple example of a constant equation of state @xmath14 and constant coupling @xmath56 . in order to gain some intuition ,",
    "i first show in fig .",
    "[ fig : v099 ] the reconstructed potential for @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "as expected , the scalar field evolves slowly in a very flat potential .",
    "notice that the potential energy is slightly below @xmath59 today due to the small kinetic energy of the scalar field .     and @xmath58 . [",
    "fig : v099 ] ]    i now turn on the interaction . in this case one",
    "has @xcite : @xmath60 and the solution to eq.([rhode ] ) is : @xmath61 the first term of the solution is the usual evolution of de without the coupling to dm . from this solution",
    "it is easy to see that one must require a positive value of the coupling @xmath62 in order to have a consistent positive value of @xmath63 for earlier epochs of the universe .",
    "this feature remains in the case of varying @xmath14 and in the rest of the paper i will assume that @xmath56 is positive .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : v09delta ] i show the effects of the coupling in the reconstructed potential .",
    "i use @xmath64 and @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the scalar potential becomes steeper for larger values of the coupling due to the different dynamics introduced by the de - dm coupling .     and",
    "@xmath58 ( solid ) , @xmath67 ( dashed ) and @xmath68 ( dot - dashed ) .",
    "[ fig : v09delta ] ]    one might have expected that the introduction of the coupling could allow the possibility of having a phantom equation of state , @xmath69 . however , it is easy to show that one can write eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi ] ) for both the uncoupled and coupled cases as : @xmath70 in the general case of a time - varying equation of state and hence , in order to have a real scalar field one must consider only @xmath71 .",
    "however , the fitter who is unaware of the interaction would instead find an effective equation of state @xmath72 defined implicitly by : @xmath73 in fig .",
    "[ fig : weff ] i show that the effective equation of state _ can _ in fact cross the phantom barrier .",
    "this possibility was also recently pointed out in the context of scalar - tensor theories of gravity @xcite .     and @xmath74 .",

    "[ fig : w ] i plot the reconstructed interaction term for @xmath78 and @xmath79 and also for @xmath80 and @xmath68 .",
    "notice that the interaction increases with time , corresponding to a mass that decreases with increasing redshift .",
    "one can see that the interaction term becomes steeper with increasing @xmath56 and decreasing @xmath81 .     and",

    "hence i will assume that it is possible to fit the 2-parameter equation of state with a 1-@xmath85 precision of @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "for illustration purposes , i will take the central values @xmath88 and @xmath89 and study the effects of dark energy interaction in the reconstruction of the potential . in fig .",
