    "the neutron - deficient lead isotopes have been the subject of intense experimental studies for nearly 20 years @xcite .",
    "this continuous interest is mainly motivated by their rich excitation spectra which strongly depend on the neutron number .",
    "first evidence for low - lying @xmath3 states in @xmath4pb was obtained from @xmath5-decay and electron capture of adjacent bi isotopes  @xcite .",
    "at least one low - lying excited @xmath3 state has now been observed in all even - even pb isotopes between @xmath6pb and @xmath7pb at excitation energies below 1  mev . in particular , @xmath8pb @xcite is a unique example of a fermion system where the two lowest excited states are @xmath3 levels with energies below 700 kev .",
    "the collective rotational bands built on top of these isomeric states suggest that they are associated with sizable deformations .",
    "the ground state of pb isotopes is known to be spherical down to @xmath6pb @xcite .",
    "the excited @xmath3 states have been interpreted within two different frameworks , the mean - field and the shell models .",
    "the apparently different mechanisms leading to these states within the two approaches have been shown to be complementary views of the same phenomenon @xcite .",
    "both models can explain the experimental data qualitatively .    in a mean - field approach ,",
    "the spectra of the pb isotopes are understood as reflecting several competing minima in an axial quadrupole energy landscape , corresponding to spherical , oblate and prolate deformations .",
    "the very name `` shape coexistence phenomenon '' comes from this mean - field description @xcite .",
    "it is present in most nuclei around the pb isotopes  @xcite and has been found also in other regions of the mass table  @xcite .",
    "first calculations based on phenomenological mean fields have predicted the existence of several competing minima in the deformation energy surface of neutron - deficient pb isotopes @xcite and a transition from oblate to prolate isomers @xcite .",
    "more recently , several variants of the self - consistent mean - field approach have confirmed these results @xcite .",
    "however , in the neutron - deficient pb region , shape coexistence can not be completely described at the level of mean - field models .",
    "the minima obtained as a function of the quadrupole moment are often rather shallow and it is not clear _ a priori _ whether they will survive dynamical effects such as quadrupole vibrations .    in a shell model picture ,",
    "the excited @xmath3 states are generated by @xmath9p-@xmath9h proton excitations across the shell gap , from the @xmath10 level to the @xmath11 .",
    "the excitation energies are lowered by a residual quadrupole - quadrupole interaction . from this point of view , the mean - field oblate minimum is associated with a proton 2p-2h configuration and the prolate one with proton 4p-4h intruder states @xcite .",

    "the deformation energy curves also present a deep minimum at superdeformed shapes for @xmath47pb which becomes shallower in @xmath46pb , and disappears for the lighter isotopes .",
    "for the three lightest isotopes , there is an additional minimum at still larger deformations , with a maximal depth of 1.5  mev for @xmath48pb .",
    "exploratory studies performed by s.  wiok @xcite indicate that calculations performed with a zero - range volume pairing interaction with appropriate strengths result in oblate and prolate minima at energies close to the experimental values . comparing our results with those presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , one also has to conclude that the form factor chosen for the pairing interaction has some influence on the relative position of the minima in @xmath8pb .",
    "however , since our aim is to determine the influence of correlations beyond mean - field for interactions that have been validated on a large set of data , we will limit ourselves to the same form of pairing as used in previous works .    for deformations between @xmath49 to @xmath50 ,",
    "the variation of energy does not exceed 2.5  mev in @xmath51pb .",
    "the barrier heights between the minima are slightly larger than 2  mev for the prolate and some superdeformed minima .",
    "in contrast , the barrier heights between spherical and oblate minima is always small .",
    "with such a topology , most minima of the potential energy curves can not be unambiguously identified with physical states and one can speculate whether these structures may be washed out by the vibrational fluctuations associated with quadrupole motion . as discussed on the basis of phenomenological energy maps for neutron - deficient pb isotopes by bengtsson and nazarewicz @xcite , it is hard to infer the effect of vibrational fluctuations only from the topology of the potential landscape .    in principle ,",

    "the depth of the oblate well is affected by angular momentum projection , as the barrier separating it from the spherical minimum is quite low for all neutron numbers .",
    "the minima obtained for specific deformations are associated with a shell effect due to a low level density around the fermi energies for both protons and neutrons . to visualize this effect ,",
    "we show nilsson plots of the proton and neutron single - particle energies for @xmath8pb in fig .",
    "[ fig : pb186:sp : p ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : pb186:sp : n ] , respectively . besides an overall offset due to the change in proton - neutron asymmetry , the proton spectra are similar for other neutron numbers .",

    "the spherical gap ( ) dominates the proton spectrum , there is also a spherical neutron subshell closure at between the @xmath54 and @xmath55 levels .",
    "several additional , smaller gaps are visible at various deformations ; let us first focus on the oblate side .",
    "a large proton shell gap is present for an oblate deformation @xmath56 . comparing the level ordering at this deformation with that at sphericity indicates that the @xmath57 levels have been pushed up from below the fermi energy and have crossed two down - sloping @xmath58 levels .",
    "the deformation at which the first level crossing occurs depends predominantly on the size of the spherical gap : the larger the gap , the larger the deformation of the oblate minimum , as this crossing corresponds to the position of the barrier between the oblate and the spherical energy minima . in a shell model picture",
    "@xcite , this oblate state is described by a 2p-2h excitation from the @xmath57 level to the @xmath58 one .",
    "the size of the oblate proton gap is mainly determined by the splitting of the @xmath58 state with deformation , which can be expected to be force independent .",
    "it depends also on the energy difference between the @xmath58 and the @xmath55 levels , which has to be large enough so that the @xmath55 states diving down with oblate deformation stay above the oblate 2p-2h gap . that the level closest to the fermi level is a @xmath58 state is supported by the fact that in adjacent even - odd tl and bi nuclei , states built on the proton @xmath58 orbital above and the @xmath57 orbital below the gap have been observed at excitation energies of only a few hundred kev @xcite .",
    "this interpretation of the oblate states is also consistent with the observation of @xmath59 high - spin isomers for @xmath60pb@xcite .",
    "these isomers are interpreted as broken - pair proton @xmath61 states .",
    "the values of their @xmath62 factor and of their spectroscopic quadrupole moment have been measured in @xmath63pb  @xcite and are consistent with excitations built on top of the excited @xmath3 oblate states .",

    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "the level ordering shown in fig .  [ fig : pb186:sp : p ] is thus corroborated by several experimental data and gives a coherent picture of the oblate minimum .",
    "the situation is less evident for the neutrons . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : pb186:sp : n ] , the levels which are responsible for the oblate neutron gap originate from the @xmath58 and @xmath55 shells .",
    "their first crossings occur at deformations around @xmath56 ; only two @xmath55 levels have energies lower than the fermi energy at the oblate minimum of @xmath8pb .",
    "as we shall show in the next sections , the energy of the predominantly oblate @xmath3 state is overestimated for all isotopes by our model . a possible cure to this deficiency",
    "could thus be to slightly decrease the energy of the @xmath55 neutron level .",
    "a larger occupation of these neutron states with large @xmath64 values would increase the quadrupole interaction between neutrons and protons , the proton levels close to the fermi energy having also large @xmath64 values .",
    "this would decrease the energy of the oblate configuration and modify its dependence on the neutron number .",
    "there are other evidences that the @xmath55 energy is overestimated . on the prolate side of deformations , levels from the spherical proton @xmath55 and @xmath58 shells come close to the fermi energy in the ground state of transactinides .",
    "an analysis of the quasiparticle spectrum of @xmath65bk performed in the cranked hfb approach using the skyrme interaction sly4 in combination with the same pairing prescription used here indicates that the @xmath55 state is predicted too high above the @xmath58 orbitaland should be lowered @xcite .",
    "a similar conclusion emerges from the analysis of the single - particle spectra in @xmath66pb , where most mean - field models predict the proton @xmath55 shell too far above the @xmath58 level @xcite . as we discussed above , however , these single - particle energies are also constrained by the properties of oblate states around @xmath8pb and the distance between these levels may not be changed by more than a few hundreds of kev .",
    "the prolate minimum is not as nicely related to a deformed proton shell effect , as no large gap is obtained for a deformation around @xmath67 equal to 0.3 .",
    "the relation of this prolate configuration to a 4p-4h shell model configuration is therefore not evident .",
    "in contrast , there is a small gap at the fermi surface for values around 0.35 , which corresponds to a 6p-6h configuration .",
    "a similar result has been obtained with the potential models used for microscopic - macroscopic calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite .    as can be seen from fig .",

    "this average value does not correspond to any observable , but is convenient to characterize the decomposition of each collective state into its mean - field components the collective wave functions for selected states are shown in fig .",

    "the first excited @xmath3 levels are dominated by oblate mean - field configurations . in @xmath14pb ,",
    "a configuration dominated by prolate mean - field states is nearly degenerate with the oblate one ; for lighter isotopes , it becomes the first excited state .    for several isotopes ,",
    "a classification of most states into rotational bands emerges quite naturally from the value of the average deformation @xmath69 .",
    "the simplest case is @xmath46pb , where rotational bands above the oblate , prolate and superdeformed configurations are easily identified in fig .",
    "[ fig : all : ex1 ] .",
    "an exception are the two nearly - degenerated @xmath72 levels found at intermediate deformations between the prolate and superdeformed bands which are very close in energy and , thus , strongly mixed .",
    "there is also an isolated @xmath73 state with @xmath74 close to zero at 2.3  mev excitation energy .",
    "such a state is present at a similar energy in all other pb isotopes studied here .",
    "the situation in @xmath8pb is nearly as simple , except for two additional bands with average deformations between those of the first prolate and the superdeformed states . in the two lighter isotopes ,",
    "the mean weight of oblate states in the predominantly oblate band is moving toward larger deformations with increasing spin , while the prolate band has a much more stable mean deformation . for @xmath68pb and @xmath7pb",
    "there are many levels above 4  mev excitation energy that can not be easily associated with a rotational band .",
    "figure  [ fig : all : wf1 ] indicate that the collective wave functions @xmath75 are spread over a large range of deformed configurations .",
    "for and 2 , this spreading extends on both the prolate and oblate sides , while for , it is more limited to the vicinity of either an oblate or a prolate configuration . unfortunately , it is difficult to represent this spreading by the mixing of only two or three configurations , as done in schematic models .",
    "a reduction of the configuration mixing basis to an oblate , prolate and spherical state leads to much too small a configuration mixing .",
    "of course , the classification in bands that we have obtained from the @xmath76 valueshas to be confirmed by the behavior of the calculated transition probabilities between the various states .",

    "a systematic discrepancy between theory and experiment is the position of the @xmath73 level interpreted as a vibration of the spherical ground state .",
    "its energy is larger than 2  mev in our calculation for all isotopes , a value to be compared with an experimental energy around 1  mev @xcite .",
    "looking back into fig .",
    "[ fig : all : wf1 ] , a plausible reason for the better agreement obtained for the prolate states than for the other levels may lie in the behavior of the wave functions . for all isotopes ,",
    "the ground state @xmath3 wave functions have an extension on the oblate side similar to the predominantly oblate wave function . on the other hand ,",
    "the amplitude of this wave function is negligible for deformations close to that of the maximum of the prolate wave function .",
    "therefore , the configurations close to sphericity should be expected to be coupled more strongly to the oblate configurations than to the prolate ones .",
    "such a strong coupling pushes the predominantly oblate @xmath3 states higher in energy than the predominantly prolate ones .",
    "a similar explanation can be invoked to account for the too high energy of the vibrational @xmath73 level constructed on the ground state .",
    "the wave function of this level extends on both prolate and oblate sides up to the tails of the oblate and prolate @xmath73 wave functions .",
    "a possible way to reduce these large overlapping regions of collective wave functions could be the inclusion of triaxial deformation , which might lead to a different spreading of wave functions in the @xmath52 direction .",
    "experimental prolate states are nicely described by our calculations , although the increase of their excitation energies with mass is slightly too fast for the heaviest isotopes .",
    "the simple picture of shape isomerism , as suggested by the potential landscapes , is supported by our calculations for oblate states , even after the inclusion of dynamical correlations on top of the shallow minima .",
    "this result is by far non trivial .",
    "however , the position of these states is slightly too high in energy and the trend with neutron number is not correct . in particular , the excitation energy of the oblate isomer is not minimal at mid - shell as it is experimentally .",

    "the variational space of the chfb method is larger than in the present calculations due to the breaking of time - reversal invariance .",
    "as long as rotation takes place in a potential well which does not vary too much with rotation , the cranking approximation is rather well justified .",
    "because of this feature , it is also well suited to describe the moment of inertia of sd bands .    to challenge chfb calculations",

    ", it can be viewed as a generalization of the method that we have already applied to the same problem  @xcite as correlations due to the restoration of angular momentum are included .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : all : ex1 ] , one sees that bands are very well localized in the superdeformed well for @xmath71pb .",
    "quadrupole deformations are slightly larger than in our cranking studies , with typical values of @xmath67 around 0.70 , compared to 0.67 in chfb for sly4 and sly6 .",
    "transitions linking the sd bands to the normal - deformed well are known in @xmath7pb  @xcite and , recently , in @xmath68pb  @xcite . from these transitions",
    "one can estimate the `` experimental '' position of the @xmath3 bandheads in these two nuclei .",
    "calculated excitation energies of 2.5  mev for @xmath68pb and 3.4  mev for @xmath7pb , are below the extrapolated experimental values of 4.425  mev for @xmath68pb and 4.878  mev for @xmath7pb .",
    "we have repeated the same calculation with the sly4 interaction used in a systematic study of the excitation energies of sd bands @xcite and obtained 4.7  mev for @xmath7pb .",
    "this value is in much better agreement with the data .",
    "this difference between both interactions gives a measure of the uncertainty related to the choice of the effective interaction .",
    "a detailed analysis shows that the excitation energy of the sd band is substantially modified by the correlations . for @xmath7pb for instance , the excitation energy of the superdeformed minimum in the potential energy surface is lowered by angular momentum projection from 3.9  mev to 3.0  mev , see  figs .",
    "[ fig : all : enz ] and [ fig : all : ejnz ] .",
    "but after configuration mixing , the superdeformed @xmath3 state is pushed up again to 3.41  mev . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : all : ex1 ] , quadrupole vibrations lower the sd state even further than the projection , but this effect is larger for the ground state , so the sd bandheads are actually pushed toward larger excitation energy . for @xmath68pb ,",
    "angular momentum projection reduces the excitation energy from 3.0  mev to 2.0  mev , while the quadrupole correlations increase it back to 2.53  mev . in the same way , using the sly4 interaction , the excitation energy of the sd band in @xmath7pb is first reduced from 5.2  mev to 4.3  mev and then increased back to 4.71  mev by the gcm .",
    "a similar reduction of the excitation energy of sd bandheads in spherical nuclei was obtained for @xmath15o @xcite and @xmath39ca @xcite . in those light nuclei ,",
    "the absolute change of the excitation energy is more pronounced .",
    "no stable states are obtained in the sd well of @xmath14pb . for lighter isotopes ,",
    "well - defined states are obtained again at large deformation .",
    "they form nice rotational bands for @xmath48pb and @xmath6pb .",
    "their excitation energies are quite small , below 3  mev , see fig .",
    "[ fig : all : ex1 ] , even if one takes the uncertainty due to the interaction into account .",
    "their quadrupole moment is also significantly larger than for the known sd bands , leading to very strong @xmath88 transition probabilities within the bands .",
    "the main aim of this paper was to determine whether it is possible to describe the coexistence of several low lying @xmath3 states in neutron - deficient pb isotopes by introducing correlations . in this respect ,",
    "our results are very positive .",
    "the evolution of the pb spectra with neutron number is qualitatively well reproduced .",
    "the direct link between symmetry restored wave functions and intrinsic mean - field configurations allows to assign a predominantly oblate structure to the first excited @xmath3 state in the heaviest pb isotopes and a predominantly prolate one in the lightest ones .",
    "this result was not evident from a - priori analyses of the mean - field deformation energy curves .",
    "in several cases , the deformed minima are located in a well not expected to be sufficiently deep to guarantee the localization of a quantum state .",
    "our results , obtained from a purely quantum mechanical method based on an effective interaction as the sole phenomenological ingredient , do support the intuitive shape coexistence picture .",
    "more detailed comparisons with the data show some discrepancies . while the energies of the predominantly prolate states reproduce the experimental data qualitatively , the energies of the oblate ones are systematically overestimated and the spreading of the rotational bands is too large",
    ". there could be different origins for these discrepancies .",
    "first , the lack of triaxial deformations could induce an overestimation of the energy of the oblate configuration .",
    "their introduction should increase the coupling between prolate and oblate states which seems to be too weak when looking into @xmath1 transition probabilities in @xmath14pb .",
    "second , mean - field states are generated by static calculations .",
    "this is not satisfactory from a variational point of view .",
    "as is well known , the projection of cranked states obtained for is better variationally and is expected to decrease the spreading of the bands .",
    "such an extension of our method is by far not trivial , but is presently underway .",
    "finally , the effective interactions have not been constructed to go beyond a mean - field approach . in principle , they should be readjusted , at least to account for the extra binding energies due to rotational and vibrational correlations . furthermore , our results could be affected by considering other generalizations of the density dependence of the skyrme force when calculating non - diagonal matrix elements , as suggested by duguet and bonche @xcite .",
    "such an investigation is presently underway . even at the mean - field level ,",
    "deficiencies of the skyrme interactions have been put into evidence .",
    "the analysis of the single - particle spectra in @xmath66pb and @xmath65bk matches up with the conclusion drawn here from the neutron - number dependence of the oblate configuration that the proton @xmath55 shell is calculated too high in excitation energy , above the @xmath58 level .",
    "this is a feature common to many effective interactions which should be taken into account in a new fit of a force .",
    "one of the major interests of our method is the determination of transition probabilities directly in the laboratory system , without relying on ad hoc approximations .",
    "unfortunately , the experimental data are very limited .",
    "the example of @xmath14pb has shown how instructive the comparison between theory and experiment for @xmath1 and @xmath2 transition probabilities can be .",
    "experimental data for other isotopes are highly desirable .    finally , we have extended our calculations up to quadrupole deformations associated with superdeformed bands . as expected , for the isotopes in which these bands are known , the excitation energies are in reasonable agreement with experiment , but the moments of inertia are too large and not as good as in our previous cranking calculations . while the disappearance of sd structures is confirmed in @xmath126pb , still more deformed configurations are predicted in the lightest isotopes .",
    "the experimental confirmation of this prediction is certainly a difficult experimental challenge , but would be an exciting result .",
