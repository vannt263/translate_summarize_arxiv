    "it is well known ( see e.g.  @xcite ) that the ratio of the @xmath12 yields @xmath13 is a particularly sensitive probe of the ozi rule @xcite . using the standard value for the deviation @xmath14 from the ideal su(3)@xmath15 mixing angle @xmath16 we have @xmath17 @xcite , where @xmath18 is the ratio of the phase - space factors .",
    "however , experimental data show an apparent excess of @xmath19 above the standard value which varies from @xmath20 in @xmath21 and @xmath22 collisions to @xmath23 in @xmath24 annihilation at rest and in flight ( see e.g.  the discussion in @xcite ) . in ref.@xcite",
    "the large excess of @xmath25 in @xmath26 and @xmath27 collisions over the prediction by the ozi rule was treated in terms of `` shake - out '' and `` rearrangement '' of an intrinsic @xmath28 component in the nucleon wave function . on the other hand , in papers @xcite the strong violation of the ozi rule in @xmath27 annihilation at rest",
    "was explained in terms of hadronic intermediate @xmath29 states which might create @xmath10 mesons .",
    "another argument in favor of a large admixture of hidden strangeness in nucleons was related to an apparently large contribution of the @xmath10-meson into the isoscalar spectral function which through the dispersion relation defines the isoscalar nucleon form factor ( see ref.@xcite ) . however , as it was shown later ( see @xcite and references therein ) , the main contribution to the isoscalar spectral function near 1 gev stems from correlated @xmath30 exchange which does not involve strange quarks .",
    "therefore , the question whether there is a large admixture of hidden strangeness in nucleons seems to be unclarified .",
    "thus , it is important to investigate such reactions where uncertainties in the interpretation of @xmath5 and @xmath10 production in terms of intermediate hadronic states are comparably small . in this paper",
    "we argue that a good choice in this respect is the reaction @xmath31 here and below @xmath32 denotes the vector mesons @xmath5 and @xmath10 .",
    "we analyze contributions of hadronic intermediate states into the @xmath2-wave amplitudes of the reactions @xmath33 and @xmath34 within the framework of the two - step model ( tsm ) described by triangle graphs with @xmath3- , @xmath4- and @xmath5-meson exchanges .",
    "previously this model was applied to the description of the pontecorvo reactions @xmath35 ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) . in a recent paper ( see ref.@xcite ) it was demonstrated that the tsm can also describe the cross section of the reaction @xmath36 near threshold with a reasonable choice of the coupling constants and cut - off parameters for @xmath3- , @xmath4- and @xmath5-meson exchanges . to predict the cross sections of the reactions @xmath37 and @xmath33 we use a similar approach and the same set of parameters for the @xmath38 coupling constants and cut - off parameters .",
    "note that if the @xmath10 and @xmath5 yields will be measured in reaction ( [ eq : vd ] ) near threshold ( which e.g.  can be done at cosy - jlich ) , the results can be useful for a better understanding of the ozi - rule violation dynamics .",
    "for example , any significant deviation from the prediction of the two - step model could be an evidence for the above mentioned `` shake out '' or `` rearrangement '' of an intrinsic @xmath28 component in the nucleon wave function .",
    "note that recent measurements of the @xmath12 ratio in the reaction @xmath39 ( performed at saturne ii @xcite ) yield @xmath40 which is also clearly above the expectation 4.2@xmath41 .",
    "however the dynamics of the reaction @xmath39 is yet not well understood . according to @xcite the two - step model underestimates the saturne data by a factor 2 , while according to @xcite the discrepancy of the two - step model with the data might be even larger when spin - effects are taken into account .",
    "experiments on @xmath5 and @xmath10 production in the reaction @xmath42 close to threshold were performed by the spes3 and disto collaborations at saturne @xcite ( see also the calculations of @xmath5 production in @xcite ) . according to the disto data",
    "the ratio of the @xmath43 production cross sections at 2.85 gev is @xmath44/ @xmath45 . introducing corrections for phase - space effects the authors of ref.@xcite",
    "found that in this case the @xmath43 ratio is @xmath46 .",
    "note that near threshold the dynamics of the reactions @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are different because the first one is constrained by the pauli principle and the two protons in the final state should be in a @xmath50 state . in the third case the final @xmath51 system is in the @xmath52 state while in the second case it can be in both states .",
    "therefore , a possible violation of the ozi rule is expected to be different in all those cases .    finally , another interesting point is that within the framework of the line - reverse invariance ( lri ) assumption the reaction @xmath53 can be related to the pontecorvo reaction @xmath54 .",
    "the data from the obelix and crystal - barrel collaborations result in a @xmath55 ratio of about @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "therefore , if lri is applicable we expect the violation of the ozi rule in the reaction @xmath53 to be much larger than it is predicted by the two - step model , which assumes the dominance of the hadronic intermediate states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : twostep ] we derive the amplitudes of the reactions @xmath57 and @xmath58 near threshold within the framework of the two - step model . in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] we discuss the choice of parameters and present the results of calculations .",
    "[ sec : conc ] contains our conclusions .",
    "the triangle diagrams describing the tsm are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : tsm ] . besides the @xmath3 exchange",
    "we also take into account @xmath4 and @xmath5 exchanges .    in the beginning",
    "let us consider the @xmath60-exchange term .",
    "in order to preserve the correct structure of the amplitude under permutations of the initial nucleons ( which should be symmetric in the isoscalar state ) the amplitude is written as the sum of the @xmath61- and @xmath62-channel contributions in the following form @xmath63 where @xmath32 is the vector meson @xmath5 or @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 are the 4-momenta of the proton , neutron , meson @xmath32 and deuteron , respectively .",
    "since we are interested in the calculation of the cross section of reaction ( [ eq : vd ] ) near threshold where the momenta of the deuteron and the meson are comparatively small , we can use a non - relativistic description of those particles by neglecting the 4th components of their polarization vectors .",
    "the relative motion of nucleons inside the deuteron is also treated non - relativistically .",
    "then one can write the two terms on the right hand side of eq .",

    "we take into account only the @xmath2-wave part of the amplitude of the elementary reaction @xmath87 . deriving eqs.([avdt],[avdu ] ) we use the following spin structure of the @xmath88 amplitude @xmath89 where @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the 4-momenta of the @xmath3 meson , the initial nucleon , the final nucleon and the vector meson , respectively .",

    "we assume that this amplitude is also small in our case and take into account only the first non spin - flip term in eq.([eq : avm ] ) .",

    "let us discuss the relation between @xmath176 and @xmath177 near threshold in more detail .",
    "fldt and wilkin @xcite proposed the following parameterization of the cross section of the reaction @xmath178 near the threshold @xmath179 this formula takes into account the strong final state interaction of two protons including also coulomb distortion with @xmath180  mev . for @xmath167 and @xmath5",

    "this model predicts a cross section of about 1520  @xmath152b at @xmath190 mev which is still not very different from parameterization ( [ fw ] ) .",
    "if parameterizations ( [ pndm ] ) and ( [ fw ] ) would be valid up to @xmath191 gev then the cross section of the reaction @xmath176 would reach the same value as the cross section of the reaction @xmath186 only at 900 mev . of course those formulas can not be valid up to such large values of q. estimations within the framework of the quark - gluon string model shows that the cross section of the reaction @xmath192 can reach maximum of about 3050  @xmath152b at @xmath9 = 100200 mev and",
    "then will start to fall ( see @xcite ) . according to the parameterization of ref.@xcite the cross section of the reaction @xmath176 reaches the value of @xmath193b at @xmath194 mev .",
    "therefore we can expect that in a rather broad interval of @xmath9 ( at least up to about 100150 mev ) the cross section of the reaction @xmath186 will be larger than the cross section of the reaction @xmath176 .",
    "this gives quite a good chance that the reaction @xmath186 can be detected using missing mass method at cosy by measuring the forward deuteron and spectator proton in the reaction @xmath195 .",
    "for the case of @xmath10 production we also expect that near threshold the cross section of the reaction @xmath196 will be larger than the cross section of the reaction @xmath197 .",
    "the latter was estimated using disto data in ref.@xcite and found to be equal to 0.28@xmath1540.14 @xmath152b at  @xmath198  mev .",
    "though there are uncertainties in extrapolating the prediction of the tsm ( eq.([pndm ] ) ) to such large @xmath9 we would have @xmath199b at this @xmath9 .",
