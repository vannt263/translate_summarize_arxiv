    "in a recent publication  @xcite we have presented a study on event shape variables and determinations of @xmath7  using data of @xmath16  annihilations at @xmath17 to @xmath4  gev recorded with the jade detector @xcite at the petra collider .",
    "this study provided valuable information which was not available before from @xmath18-annihilations in the petra energy range .",
    "the results on @xmath7 , obtained in a manner similar to the determinations at lep , demonstrated that the energy dependence of @xmath19  is in good agreement with the prediction of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . evolved to the @xmath20 mass scale , the results agree well with those obtained at lep , and are of similar precision . in addition , power corrections , applied to analytic qcd calculations of the mean values of event shape distributions , were found to qualitatively and quantitatively describe the effects of hadronisation .",
    "thus qcd could be tested without the need of phenomenological hadronisation models .",
    "meanwhile the perturbative calculations for the jet broadening variables were improved by including a proper treatment of the quark recoil  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a resummation of leading and next - to - leading logarithm terms to all orders of @xmath7  ( nlla ) became available for the @xmath2-parameter  @xcite . besides these advances in the perturbative description of event shape observables progress was made in the understanding of non - perturbative power corrections to the event shape observables and their mean values .",
    "in particular two - loop calculations of such corrections were performed which modify the one - loop result of the power correction to the event shapes by a factor ( milan factor ) @xcite .",
    "revisiting the interdependence between perturbative and non - perturbative contributions for the case of jet broadening observables yielded in reference  @xcite a further modification of the results given in  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we complement our previous publication @xcite by a new @xmath21+nlla determination of @xmath7  from @xmath2-parameter and update our @xmath7  determination from jet broadening at @xmath22 and @xmath4 gev in the sections  [ sec - procedure ] and [ sec - alphas ] .",
    "we also applied power corrections to the @xmath2-parameter distributions and re - investigated those for the mean values of the thrust , heavy jet mass and both jet broadening observables in section  [ sec - meanvalues ] .",
    "we start in section  [ sec - data ] with a brief summary of the data samples used and draw conclusions from our results in section  [ sec - conclusions ] .",
    "the jade detector was operated from 1979 until 1986 at the petra electron - positron collider at centre - of - mass energies of @xmath23 to @xmath24 gev .",
    "a detailed description of the jade detector can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the components mainly used for this analysis were the central jet chamber to measure charged particle tracks and the lead glass calorimeter to measure energy depositions of electromagnetic showers , which both covered almost the whole solid angle of @xmath25 .",
    "for the present study we consider data collected by the jade detector in 1984 to 1986 at centre - of - mass energies between @xmath26-@xmath24  gev and at @xmath27  gev .",
    "multihadronic events were selected by the standard jade selection cuts  @xcite which have been summarised in detail in our previous publication  @xcite .",
    "background from two - photon processes and @xmath28-pair events and from events with hard initial state photon radiation were mainly suppressed by posing constraints on the visible energy , the total momentum and the charged particle multiplicity of the event , and by cuts in the polar angle of the thrust axis .",
    "the estimated purity of the resulting data samples is about 98% @xcite .",
    "the numbers of events retained after these cuts are @xmath29 around @xmath30 @xmath4  gev and @xmath31 at @xmath30 @xmath27  gev .",
    "corresponding _ original _ monte carlo detector simulation data for @xmath27 and @xmath4  gev were based on the qcd parton shower plus string fragmentation implemented by the jetset 6.3 event generator  @xcite .",
    "both samples included a detailed simulation of the acceptance and resolution of the jade detector .",
    "we used the standard set of parameters for the event generation as described in  @xcite .",
    "as pointed out there , the agreement of the simulated data with the measurements is good .",
    "from the data passing the selection criteria as described in the previous section , the distributions of the @xmath2-parameter and the jet broadening event shape variables @xmath5 and @xmath6 were determined using the 3-momenta @xmath32 of the reconstructed particles .",
    "the @xmath2-parameter is defined in reference  @xcite as @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , are the eigenvalues of the momentum tensor @xmath36 the definition of the total and wide jet broadening measures can be found in reference  @xcite .",
    "limits of the acceptance and resolution of the detector and effects due to initial state photon radiation were corrected by a bin - by - bin correction procedure .",
    "the correction factors were defined by the ratio of the distribution calculated from events generated by jetset 6.3 at _ hadron level _ over the same distribution at _ detector level_. the _ hadron level _ distributions were obtained from jetset 6.3 generator runs without detector simulation and without initial state radiation , using all particles with lifetimes @xmath37  s. events at _ detector level _ contained initial state photon radiation and a detailed simulation of the detector response , and were processed in the same way as the data .",
    "the data distributions were further corrected for hadronisation effects by applying bin - by - bin correction factors derived from the distributions at _ parton level _ and at _ hadron level _ , where the parton level is given by the partons before hadronisation . in the upper part of fig .",
    "[ fig - asresult ] , the hadronisation correction for the distributions of the @xmath2-parameter at @xmath22 and @xmath4 gev are shown .",
    "the correction factors for all event shapes are typically of the order @xmath38 to @xmath39% increasing towards the @xmath8-jet region .",
    "systematic uncertainties of the corrected data distributions were investigated by modifying details of the event selection and of the correction procedure . for each variation",
    "the whole analysis was repeated and any deviation from the main result was considered as a systematic error . in general , the maximum deviation from the main result for each kind of variation was regarded as a symmetric systematic uncertainty .",
    "the main result was obtained using the default selection and correction procedure as described above .    to estimate experimental uncertainties , we considered either tracks or clusters for the measurement of the event shape distributions",
    ". furthermore , the selection cuts for multihadronic events were either loosened or tightened as described in  @xcite , in order to check the influence of background events on the measurement .",
    "the impact of the hadronisation model of the jetset 6.3 generator was studied by varying the values of several significant model parameters around their tuned values from reference  @xcite used for our main result .",
    "the variations amount to the percentage of the one standard deviations found in reference  @xcite from a parameter tuning of jetset . in detail , effects due to parton shower , hadronisation parameters , and quark masses were considered , following the procedure in  @xcite .",
    "these uncertainties of the hadronisation corrections are shown for the @xmath2-parameter distributions at @xmath22 and @xmath4  gev as shaded band around the correction factors in the upper part of figure  [ fig - asresult ] .",
    "the data values for the event shape distributions and the corresponding mean value of the @xmath2-parameter corrected to _ hadron level _ are listed in table  [ tab - eventshapes-35 + 44gev ] , where also the statistical errors and experimental systematic uncertainties are given .",
    "our measurements of the jet broadening event shape distributions can be found in reference  @xcite .    after correcting for hadronisation ,",
    "the event shape distributions were compared directly with the analytic qcd calculations .",
    "we determined the strong coupling constant @xmath7  by @xmath40  fits to the event shape distributions of @xmath2 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "the fits to the @xmath2-parameter distributions considered the resummation results obtained in  @xcite .",
    "for the fits to the jet broadening measures we used the improved calculation of reference  @xcite .",
    "for the sake of direct comparison with other published results we chose the @xmath41-matching scheme@xcite to merge the @xmath21@xcite with the nlla calculations .",
    "the renormalisation scale factor , @xmath42 was set to @xmath43 for the main result .",
    "the fit ranges for each observable were chosen to be the largest range for which the hadronisation uncertainties remained less than @xmath44 , for which the contribution of an extreme bin did not dominate the @xmath45 , and for which fits were stable .",
    "the remaining changes in @xmath7  when modifying the fit range by one bin on either side were taken as systematic uncertainties .",
    "only statistical errors were considered in the fit .    in order to investigate the importance of higher order terms in the theory",
    ", we also changed the renormalisation scale factor in the range of @xmath46 to @xmath47 .",
    "the associated renormalisation scale uncertainties are larger than those from the detector correction and the hadronisation model dependence .",
    "our results for @xmath7  from @xmath5 , @xmath6 and the @xmath2-parameter at @xmath22 and @xmath4 gev are given in table  [ tab - asresult - new ] , where also the statistical and systematic uncertainties of the measurements are given .",
    "it should be pointed out that the improved perturbative calculation for the jet broadening resulted in an increased @xmath7  value , not affecting the systematic uncertainties but improving the @xmath45    in figure  [ fig - asresult - numbers ] the @xmath7  values from this study are shown with those obtained from the distributions of thrust , heavy jet mass and the differential 2-jet rate using the durham scheme as presented in our previous publication  @xcite . replacing the @xmath7  values obtained from the jet broadening observables",
    ", a single @xmath7  value was obtained from the individual determinations from the six event shape observables following the procedure described in references  @xcite .",
    "this procedure accounts for correlations of the systematic uncertainties . at each energy",
    ", a weighted average of the six @xmath7   values was calculated with the reciprocal of the respective squared total error used as a weight .",
    "for each of the systematic checks , the mean of the @xmath7  values from all considered observables was determined .",
    "any deviation of this mean from the weighted average of the main result was taken as a systematic uncertainty .    the final results for @xmath7  are @xmath48 where the systematic errors at @xmath27 and @xmath4  gev are the quadratic sums of the experimental uncertainties ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) , the effects due to the monte carlo modelling ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) and the contributions due to variation of the renormalisation scale ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) .",
    "the modelling uncertainties due to quark mass effects contribute significantly to the total error .",
    "the strong coupling constant @xmath7  can also be extracted from the energy dependence of the mean values of event shape distributions .",
    "non - perturbative effects are inherent in the event shape observables due to the contributions of very low energetic gluons and of hadronisation . for an observable @xmath55 the effect of the gluons",
    "can be represented by additive power - suppressed corrections ( @xmath56 ) to the perturbative predictions of the mean values of the event shape distributions ( @xmath57 ) . in the calculations of reference  @xcite which we used in this analysis a non - perturbative parameter @xmath58",
    "was introduced to replace the divergent portion of the perturbative expression for @xmath59 below an infrared matching scale @xmath60 .",
    "the power corrections to event shape observables have been calculated in references  @xcite up to two - loops .",
    "it was found that the two - loop result is identical to the one - loop calculation of reference  @xcite up to a factor @xmath61 , which is known as the milan factor , and a factor @xmath62 , which is due to defining the non - perturbative parameter @xmath63 as above .",
    "the power corrections for the mean values of thrust ( @xmath64 ) , heavy jet mass ( @xmath65 ) and @xmath2-parameter is @xmath66 it was recently found in reference  @xcite that an additional factor has to be applied in the case of jet broadening observables . in leading order",
    "the factors are given by @xmath67 for total ( @xmath5 ) and wide ( @xmath6 ) jet broadening , respectively .",
    "the @xmath68 coefficients which depend on the observable @xmath55 are calculable .",
    "they assume the values @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 for thrust , heavy jet mass , total and wide jet broadening , and @xmath2-parameter , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the power correction to the mean values of an event shape @xmath55 is an additive term to the perturbative prediction , @xmath73 .",
    "we determined @xmath74 and the non - perturbative parameter @xmath75 from @xmath40  fits of this expression to the mean values of thrust , heavy jet mass , @xmath2-parameter , total and wide jet broadening .",
    "the fits included the measured mean values published by various experiments at different centre - of - mass energies  @xcite between @xmath76 and @xmath12  gev .",
    "for the central fit results of @xmath7 , we fixed the renormalisation scale factor @xmath77 to one and the infrared scale to @xmath78  gev .",
    "theoretical systematic uncertainties were assessed by varying @xmath79   from @xmath80 to @xmath8 , @xmath60 from @xmath81 to @xmath82  gev , and @xmath83 within the quoted uncertainty .",
    "figure  [ fig - as - powcor ] shows the data values and the fit curves for the @xmath2-parameter , the total and the wide jet broadening , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath45  of the fits is between @xmath84 ( for the heavy jet mass ) and @xmath85 ( for the thrust ) .",
    "the numeric results of all fits are summarized in table  [ tab - as - powcor ] , presenting the values for @xmath74 and for @xmath75 , their experimental errors and systematic uncertainties .",
    "we also quote averages of the individual @xmath7  and @xmath63 results which were calculated according to the procedure used in section  [ sec - alphas ] .",
    "we consider these results as a test of the new theoretical prediction  @xcite for the power corrections to the mean values of event shapes .",
    "it should be noted that the individual results for @xmath75 scatter around the average value of @xmath86 , where the error is the total uncertainty .",
    "the r.m.s .  of the scatter is @xmath87 .",
    "the theoretically expected universality of @xmath63 is , therefore , observed at the level of better than @xmath88 .",
    "our final value of the strong coupling from the fits to the energy dependence of the mean values of event shapes is @xmath89 where the error is the total uncertainty .",
    "this result lies about 2% above the value obtained in our previous analysis  @xcite , which did not consider the new milan correction nor the revisited calculation for the power correction of the jet broadening observables .",
    "our updated result is in good agreement with the world average value  @xcite of @xmath90 and is of similar precision .",
    "inclusion of jade data and the availability of improved calculations substantially increased the significance and consistency of qcd tests based on measurements of hadronic event shapes .",
    "we updated our determinations  @xcite of the strong coupling constant @xmath7  at @xmath22 and @xmath4  gev using @xmath41-matching for the combination of @xmath21  and resummed calculations now including the @xmath2-parameter .",
    "improved perturbative calculations to the jet broadening measures @xmath5 and @xmath6 were applied .",
    "we found these calculations to describe the data better .",
    "the @xmath91 values were also found to be more consistent with those from other event shape observables .",
    "evolving our combined @xmath7  measurements to @xmath92 we obtain @xmath93 and @xmath94 from @xmath27 and @xmath4  gev data , respectively , resulting in a combined value of @xmath95 .",
    "we further investigated mean values of the event shape distributions for the energy range of the petra and lep colliders and compared directly with analytic qcd predictions plus power corrections for hadronisation effects , the latter involving a universal non - perturbative parameter @xmath63 .",
    "our present studies , based on two - loop calculations for the event shapes , yield @xmath96 , which is in good agreement with our results from the @xmath21+nlla fits and also with the world average value .",
    "the expected universality of the non - perturbative parameter @xmath63 is now observed at a level of better than @xmath97% .",
