[ ] , which described the fractional quantum hall effect through a collection of coupled , interacting quantum wires . in this sense ,",
    "fractional helical luttinger liquids are related to the edge states of fractional quantum hall systems.@xcite    one experimental signature of helical luttinger liquids is provided by its charge transport properties.@xcite while a reduced conductance as compared to a regular spinful luttinger liquid is certainly characteristic for a helical state , it does not unambiguously identify this state .",
    "a number of recent works has thus addressed further properties of a helical luttinger liquid with an emphasis on its spectral properties@xcite , disorder effects,@xcite and its spin response.@xcite in this work , we further investigate the spectral properties of ( quasi ) helical and fractional helical luttinger liquids , thereby also taking into account the coupling between gapped and gapless modes in the wire , and address its response at small but finite frequencies . by calculating various low - energy characteristics , we find that the charge transport properties of a ( quasi ) helical or a fractional helical luttinger liquid can be understood as the ones of a regular spinless luttinger liquid coupled to ( interacting ) luttinger liquid leads .",
    "their conductance is independent of the luttinger parameters in the wire , but depends on the form of the sine - gordon potential that opens the partial gap , as has already been found in ref .",
    "the analogy between a partially gapped and a spinless luttinger liquid does , however , not hold for the electronic tunneling density of states , which vanishes for fractional helical luttinger liquids .",

    "we consider a one - dimensional electron system in which spin and charge excitations are locked by a sine - gordon potential .",
    "one currently well - studied example are rashba nanowires in a magnetic field .",
    "the rashba interaction defines a spin quantization axis , and splits the dispersions for spin up and spin down in momentum space .",
    "a homogenous magnetic field applied perpendicular to the rashba - defined spin quantization axis then allows for spin flips and opens up a partial gap close to zero momentum.@xcite the residual gapless modes are helical in that their spin is ( approximately ) aligned to their direction of motion . denoting the spin quantization axis set by the rashba interaction as @xmath0 in spin space , the perpendicular magnetic field",

    "is treated as a perturbation to the ungapped rashba nanowire .",
    "we linearize the latter s kinetic energy around the fermi points and decompose the fermionic operators into right and left movers as @xmath8 with @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the spin - orbit momentum , while @xmath11 corresponds to the fermi momentum in the absence of spin - orbit interaction ( we assume @xmath12 without loss of generality ) .",
    "bosonizing the theory as usual,@xcite the magnetic field translates to a sine - gordon term . for a general value of the chemical potential ,",
    "this sine - gordon term contains rapidly oscillating exponential factors @xmath13 , which render the magnetic field irrelevant .",
    "only when the chemical potential is placed in the vicinity of the band crossing at zero momentum , that is for @xmath14 , the sine - gordon term has the non - oscillating part @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the bosonic field related to the integrated charge density , while @xmath17 is proportional to the integrated spin current , and @xmath18 denotes a short - distance cutoff .",
    "this sine - gordon term is in general relevant in the renormalization group ( rg ) sense , and its flow to strong coupling signals the opening of the before - mentioned partial gap in the bosonic language .",
    "the mixing of the bosonic spin and charge fields may , however , take more complicated forms than the one in eq .  .",
    "as such , it has been proposed@xcite that higher order interaction terms can give rise to sine - gordon potentials that generalize the spin - charge mixing of rashba nanowires , and lead to the emergence of a fractional helical luttinger liquid with fractional electric conductance ( in this denomination , a rashba nanowire corresponds to an integer helical luttinger liquid ) .",
    "if brought into contact with a superconductor , these systems are expected to host fractionalized majorana bound states ( parafermions).@xcite a fractional helical luttinger liquids can be constructed by combining the @xmath19 order of a perturbation theory in a ( contact ) interaction @xmath20 with the magnetic field , which generates a term of the form    @xmath21    this term is non - oscillating if the chemical potential is fine - tuned such that @xmath22 , in which case the bosonization of eq .",

    "if this kick matches the momentum difference between right movers of the first wire and left movers of the second wire , a partial gap analogue to the helical gap in a rashba nanowire opens.@xcite a combined perturbation theory in the coulomb repulsion and the pair tunneling between the wires then again allows to promote the inter wire tunneling to the form @xmath28\\phi_c+[2m+1]\\theta_s))$ ] , where the spin field @xmath29 is now defined with respect to the pseudospin labeling the two wires . again , a given sine - gordon term is only stable for a specific value of @xmath11 at fixed perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "these values can be understood as the one - dimensional analogues of the filling fractions of the fractional quantum hall state.@xcite    in this work , we aim at analyzing the low - energy properties of generic fractional helical luttinger liquids . to this end",
    ", we consider a general model with the imaginary time action ( in units of @xmath30)@xcite @xmath31 here , we have introduced the inverse propagators @xmath32 and @xmath33 . as before , the bosonic fields @xmath34 and @xmath29 relate to the integrated charge density and spin current , respectively , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the effective velocities of the charge and spin excitations , while @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the corresponding luttinger parameters .",
    "the locking of charge and spin degrees of freedom is described by the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the relative locking @xmath41 may also be understood as a measure of the degree of fractionalization in the wire,@xcite see below .",
    "if the argument of the cosine potential derives from a combination of an integer number interaction terms and the backscattering term , @xmath39 and @xmath40 can take odd integer values , see above .",

    "sec : fll ] .",
    "the sine - gordon term proportional to @xmath45 is most conveniently analyzed by a renormalization group ( rg ) analysis and may at low energies either scale to zero or open up a gap .",
    "since the fixed point action in the former case corresponds to a gapless and therefore trivial quantum wire , we assume the sine - gordon potential to be relevant in the rg sense .",
    "an analysis along the lines of references [ ] shows that a gap is indeed opened for @xmath46 , while the fixed point action is gapless for larger values of @xmath37 .",
    "electron - electron interactions are thus not only crucial in generating the sine - gordon terms , but also decide on their relevance in the rg sense .",
    "once the gap is opened , the wire s low - energy properties can be described by expanding the cosine potential to quadratic order in the fields . in the limit of a large gap ,",
    "this quadratic expansion is equivalent to a self - consistent harmonic approximation .",
    "this yields the low - energy action @xmath47 where @xmath48 and    @xmath49    [ eq : diff_op ]    and with @xmath50 .",

    "the infinite gap limit of the charge propagator reads @xmath58 in this limit , the spin propagator and the mixed propagators are furthermore identical up to signs and factors of @xmath59 , @xmath60 one can now rewrite the theory with an effective luttinger parameter @xmath61 and an effective velocity @xmath62 ,    [ eq : effparam ] @xmath63    these expressions have also been found in reference [ ] .@xcite the luttinger parameters and velocities appearing in eqs .",
    "are to be understood as the renormalized values obtained at the end of the flow associated with the rg relevant sine - gordon potential @xmath64 mixing spin and charge degrees of freedom . in terms of the effective parameters , the charge propagator takes the form @xmath65 .",
    "the physics of the charge sector may therefore be understood as the one of a spinless luttinger liquid upon redefining @xmath66 .",
    "the field @xmath67 then has the propagator @xmath68 with @xmath69 .",
    "this implies that the individual spin and charge velocities and luttinger parameters have no physical importance once spin and charge degrees of freedom get locked . instead",
    ", the single gapless mode remaining after the opening of the partial gap is characterized by a velocity @xmath70 and a luttinger parameter @xmath71 given in eq .  ,",
    "which can for instance be accessed through the drude peak or the tunneling density of states , see below , as well as spectroscopy experiments.@xcite the initial spin and charge parameters become visible only at energies much larger than the gap , at which spin and charge degrees of freedom can again be excited individually .",
    "the conductance follows from the spatial fourier transform of the analytic continuation of eq .  .",
    "in linear response theory , it is given by the kubo formula    @xmath72    note that the @xmath4-dependence vanishes in the zero frequency limit .",
    "restoring @xmath73 , the conductance reads@xcite @xmath74 we thus find that the conductance of an infinite , homogeneous wire depends not only on the interaction parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 , but also on the ratio of the charge and spin velocities , as well as on @xmath75 .",
    "the ratio of charge and spin velocities enters the conductance because the gap couples the spin and charge degrees of freedom in the wire .",
    "if these do not propagate at the same speed , a pure charge excitation ( such as the electric current ) can not propagate as easily as if the velocities were the same .",
    "this is similar to the suppression of the inter band ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) exchange in multi subband wires@xcite or the coulomb drag between two wires.@xcite the ratio of @xmath40 and @xmath39 , on the other hand , encodes how much spin and charge is being gapped out by the sine - gordon potential .",

    ", gapping out half of them results in exactly one gapless electronic mode in the wire . for @xmath103",
    ", however , there is either too little gapless charge or too little gapless spin to form a full electronic state , and the density of states for electrons vanishes consequently .",

    "is recovered , while the conductivity approaches the expression of a spinful and gapless luttinger liquid at large frequencies . for frequencies close to the gap ,",
    "not only the expansion of the sine - gordon potential is unjustified , but the conductivity also shows some unphysical , noisy features ( sections drawn with a gray dashed line).,scaledwidth=49.0% ]",
    "in this work , we have analyzed the conductance and finite frequency conductivity , the drude peak and the density of states of a partially gapped quantum wire .",
    "similar to a gapless wire , the presence of fermi liquid leads strongly modifies the conductance , and brings it from the non - universal value given in eq .  , which depends on the effective velocities and luttinger liquid parameters inside the wire , to the form of eq .  .",
    "in particular , the conductance of a ( fractional ) helical wire connected to leads does not depend on the effective velocities and luttinger liquid parameters inside the interacting wire .",
    "its expression does , however , not follow from the one of an infinite , homogeneous wire upon replacing all wire parameters by lead parameters ( such as @xmath213 ) .",
    "this is different from a gapless quantum wire.@xcite in the latter case , the interacting wire can be smoothly deformed into a gapless fermi liquid .",
    "such a smooth deformation can not be found between a partially gapped and a fully gapless state .",
    "furthermore , the conductance of a partially gapped quantum wire also depends on the precise form of the sine - gordon potential that drives the opening of the partial gap , as has already been established in ref .",
    "[ ] . as a consequence ,",
    "the number of gapless modes is not sufficient to evaluate the conductance once spin and charge degrees of freedom get mixed . for a sine - gordon potential of the form @xmath214 , the conductance reads @xmath215 . by symmetry of @xmath216 along with @xmath217",
    ", we furthermore conclude that a sine - gordon potential of the type @xmath218 would yield a similar conductance of @xmath219 .",
    "the conductance is thus in general not quantized in integer multiples of @xmath220 , which can be understood as a signature of charge fractionalization.@xcite the general form of the conductance given in in eq .",
    "also reproduces the conductance @xmath221 of a mott insulator ( where @xmath222 ) , the value @xmath223 of a spin - density wave state ( where @xmath224 ) , and the conductance @xmath225 of a spin polarized system ( the latter case would correspond to a sine - gordon potential of the form @xmath226 with @xmath227 ) .",
    "in addition to the conductance , we have also calculated the drude peak of the optical conductivity of ( quasi ) helical and fractional helical wires . finally analyzing the non - local conductivity of fractional helical luttinger liquids at finite frequencies",
    ", we have furthermore shown that the low frequency charge transport properties of a fractional helical luttinger liquid can be understood as the ones of a spinless luttinger liquid coupled to interacting luttinger liquid leads .",
    "this analogy , however , does not hold for all properties .",
    "the tunneling density of states is for instance only non - zero for regular helical luttinger liquids without fractionalization . at frequencies larger than the gap",
    ", the wire finally behaves as a gapless , spinful luttinger liquid coupled to fermi liquid leads .",
    "the recovery of the gapless behavior is explicitly contained in our treatment .    we would like to thank b. braunecker , j. klinovaja , v. meden , a. rosch , a. saha , t. schmidt , and p. simon for helpful discussions .",

    ", we note that rashba nanowires subject to a magnetic field perpendicular to the direction set by the spin - orbit interaction correspond to @xmath90.@xcite in these systems , the helical gap around zero momentum@xcite leads to a reduction of the density of states by a factor of two as compared to gapless wires .",
