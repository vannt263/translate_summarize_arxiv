    "planets form accretion disks that surround and feed mass onto young stars , but there is significant gravitational feedback between the planets and their parent disks @xcite .",
    "this produces a variety of disk architectures that often differ from our own solar system .",
    "understanding planet - disk interactions is essential for understanding planetary positions , observational signatures for exo - planets , and the time scales that planet formation models must accommodate .    despite significant theoretical progress @xcite ,",
    "key questions remain .",
    "the time scale for planet formation , @xmath3 , remains uncertain .",
    "gas giant planets might form rapidly ( @xmath4 y ) through gravitational instability @xcite , or slowly through core accretion @xcite where agglomeration of dust grains creates a rocky core that accretes surrounding gas .",
    "core accretion has been estimated to take @xmath1 my , although recent arguments @xcite lowering this to @xmath5myr may be required by sst observations .",
    "sst has provided a rapidly growing database of high resolution ir spectral observations of young disk - star systems . from the deficit of emission at wavelengths characteristic of the disk",
    "inner regions , the observations imply that some systems have mass - depleted inner disks : surrounding the star cokutau/4 is a disk with a @xmath6 au spectral hole bounded by a very sharp outer edge , strongly indicative of the influence of a planet . within 9 au , the hole seems to require a density to be @xmath7 times that which would otherwise be present if the disk inferred at 9au were extended via standard models all the way to the star ( dalessio et al .",
    "such holes extend are beyond the scale for which a magnetic field would be important @xcite and the sharpness is unlikely to be explained by a radiation pressure or a wind @xcite . while the presence of a planet is currently the most plausible explanation for the sharp edge and hole , the young age @xcite of the system , @xmath8my presents challenges for planet formation models @xcite .",
    "sst observations of other systems reveal direct evidence for accretion in systems with and without spectral holes ( muzerolle et al . , 2005 , n. calvet & d. watson , personal communication )    here we show , via direct numerical simulations , that jupiter mass planets orbiting a solar mass star clear out inner holes all the way to the star on a time scale faster than the viscous or planet migration time scales .",
    "we identify this fast accretion with enhanced angular momentum transport by spiral waves induced by the planet and we find that a specific limit of the general theory of takeuchi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) of spiral wave angular momentum transport in turbulent disks offers a consistent explanation of our results .",
    "we emphasize that in our calculations , the planet is embeded in an already turbulent disk with an @xmath9-viscosity @xcite .",
    "our approach therefore differs from e.g @xcite , for which the disk has no means of angular momentum transport other than a dissipation of spiral waves themselves . for the latter",
    ", @xcite showed that , in the absence of turbulent viscous damping , waves will become weak shocks , which can provide a modest effective viscosity @xcite .",
    "this mechanism was shown by @xcite to be effective for hot disks and has been called `` wave accretion '' @xcite .",
    "it was originally presented , in the case of white dwarf binaries , as a possible explanation for the observed optical periodicities in @xcite . while our work here does appeal to the impact of spiral waves in the transport of angular momentum , it is important that for us these waves act in addition to the baseline disk turbulence . in the case",
    "considered herein , the pre - existing turbulent viscosity keeps the waves linear , preventing steepening into shocks and thereby allowing transport over farther distances from the wave launch . point .",
    "this increases the effective angular momentum transport from the case where weak shocks form as long as the initial viscosity is not too large .",
    "in addition to showing that our results are consistent with the theory of takeuchi et al .",
    "1996 , we use the results to account for the recent spectral holes observed in young yso system such cokutau 4 @xcite .    in section 2 we discuss our numerical calculations of the surface density and accretion rate evolution .",
    "we discuss the results , interpretation , and implications in section 3 and conclude in section 4 .",
    "to determine whether planets can produce sharp extended spectral holes and to calculate the associated mass accretion rates , we have carried out a series of 2-d simulations of planets opening up disk gaps which then evolve into holes as material drains onto the star .",
    "while there have been previous numerical simulations of gap formation @xcite , our work differs in that we have followed the disk accretion significantly longer , capturing the inner disk clearing all the way to the star .",
    "we use a code which eliminates the azimuthal velocity from the computation of the courant - friedrich - lvy condition .",
    "this speeds up the computation and facilitates studying the long term disk evolution .",
    "our simulations begin with a viscosity parameter @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the viscosity and @xmath12 is the local sound speed .",
    "the disk height - to - radius ratio @xmath13 , independent of radius .",
    "this corresponds to a reynolds number @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the keplerian speed .",
    "we performed simulations with @xmath16 grid cells and @xmath17 grid cells to test for convergence .    in the absence of a planet , accretion at any radius",
    "occurs at the viscous time @xmath18 ( @xmath19 yr at @xmath20au ) . here",
    "were compare this to the case when a planet is present .",
    "we ran simulations for a variety of planet masses @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , orbital radii @xmath23 and @xmath24 au , and initial surface density profiles @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "the two values for @xmath27 exhibit similar results .",
    "we focus on the @xmath28 case herein .",
    "the planet was always initially set onto a circular orbit and was free to migrate via angular momentum exchange with the disk .",

    "1 shows @xmath29 at five different times for a case in which @xmath30 au and @xmath31 .",
    "as seen at @xmath32 , the surface density in the inner regions first increases as matter is pushed toward the star and the gap opens , but an inner hole forms subsequently as material is lost to the star .",
    "the gap near 1au forms in less than @xmath33 orbits and a hole cleared all the way to the star ( i.e. @xmath34 drops by factor @xmath35 for all @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the radius of the star ) clears by @xmath38 orbits which is @xmath39 the viscous time at @xmath40 , by 6000 orbits , the surface density has droped by a nearly a factor of @xmath41.at 1au and by @xmath42 at 0.4au .    fig .",

    "2 represents the mass evolution in the case with no planet in a disk limited to a @xmath20 au size , for comparison with the much faster time evolution of the surface density when the planet is present .",

    "measurements of seds for disks are sensitive to dust only , and the gas density is inferred from assuming a gas - to - dust density ratio @xcite .",
    "direct measure of @xmath52 requires detection of molecular lines such as those from co , which is difficult . for a given @xmath9 ,",
    "measuring @xmath53 provides an alternative measure of @xmath54 .",
    "observations of proto - planetary disks with seds showing holes often indicate accretion rates @xmath55/yr .",
    "@xcite . despite the spectral holes ,",
    "this rate is still large , of order @xmath56 of the rates typical for similar disks without an inner hole ( called class ii objects ) .",
    "the accretion rate at any given time depends on the initial disk mass , which can vary between systems , so an important quantity to extract from simulations is the ratio of the initial @xmath53 to that after the spectral hole is present . in our simulations ,",
    "the initial parameters give @xmath57 . focusing on the @xmath58 case of fig .",
    "3 , @xmath53 rises to nearly @xmath59 at @xmath60y , and subsequently drops to @xmath61 at @xmath62 y after which it continues to decay .",
    "1 - 3 thus demonstrate both ( 1 ) rapid hole formation and ( 2 ) substantial accretion rates even after a hole of with a @xmath42 deficit in surface density has formed .",
    "note also that the absence of significant planet migration on the hole clearing time suggests that spectral holes likely accompany massive planets .    in fig",
    "[ fig : sed ] we compare the sed at two different times during the hole formation with the planet - free case .",
    "the figure shows the planet s effect on the spectra as early as @xmath63 orbits ( on the left ) . the effect grows stronger with time until a spectral hole forms",
    "the faster - than - viscous rapid hole formation exhibited in figs.1 - 3 is due to outward angular momentum transport at @xmath64 from spiral waves driven off of resonances between the orbital motion of the planet and disk material @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , our approach is different from that of @xcite and @xcite , as we take an already viscous disk .",
    "@xcite showed that , in the absence of viscous damping , weak shocks produced by the spiral waves , provide an effective viscosity @xmath65 .",
    "we therefore proceed to analyze our results in the context of takeuchi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) who considered spiral wave induced angular momentum transport in which turbulent viscosity damps the waves sufficiently to sustain keep them linear , before they steepen weak shocks . since angular momentum",
    "is transported only over the damping length , a finite viscosity allows waves to transport angular momentum over a large distance .",
    "if the initial viscosity were too high , then the waves would have no effect . our viscosity and planet - to - star mass ratio satisfy the condition in takeuchi et al .",

    "the total torque per unit length produced by the planet on the disk is given by @xmath67 , where the subscript m refers to the m - th orbital lindblad resonance @xcite .",
    "interior to the planet , spiral waves enhance the outward angular momentum transport from a purely viscous disk .",
    "they transport angular momentum out to a distance to which the waves damp .",

    "( 1 ) from waves launched at the @xmath76 resonance @xcite . assuming that the initial gap corresponds to the damping length of these large @xmath73 waves , takeuchi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) obtain for the gap width ( [ td0 ] ) @xmath77 where @xmath9 is specifically used to replace the combination of @xmath78 .",
    "the @xmath79 waves produce the gap seen near @xmath40 at @xmath33 orbits in fig 1 .",
    "although the large @xmath73 linear waves that form the initial gap transport angular momentum faster than small @xmath73 waves , the latter damp over a shorter distance .",
    "once large @xmath73 waves clear out a gap , the decrease in surface density at their launch location reduces their subsequent contribution to the global angular momentum transport , and the influence of the higher density inner regions takes over .",
    "we now argue that the faster - than - viscous hole clearing by @xmath80 is consistent with low @xmath81 waves launched from their lindblad resonance at ( e.g. @xcite ) @xmath82 dominating @xmath83 .",
    "( we note that @xmath81 are the lowest modes relevant for a kelperian disk but @xmath84 could be relevant for sub - keplerian disks for which @xmath85 differs significantly from @xmath86 . )",
    "the damping length @xmath68 in the limit of low @xmath73 waves is not explicitly estimated in @xcite , but we can estimate it from the low @xmath73 limit of ( [ td0 ] ) . to do so , we assume ( to be justified later ) that the damping length @xmath68 is large enough that @xmath87 , so @xmath88 . then ( [ td0 ] ) becomes @xmath89 we use the approximation @xmath90 so that ( [ td1 ] ) becomes @xmath91 where ( @xcite ) @xmath92^{1/2 } \\sim { ( m^2 - 1)^{1/2}\\over h(r_l - l)}\\sim \\left({3^{1/2}\\over 0.63r_p - l}\\right){r\\over h }    \\label{td4},\\ ] ] and the latter similarity follows for @xmath93 and @xmath81 . using ( [ td4 ] ) in ( [ td3 ] ) then gives @xmath94 if we take @xmath95 and @xmath96 as per our simulations , then for @xmath81 , @xmath97 , so that @xmath98 .",
    "the viscous time at @xmath99 is @xmath100yr .",
    "1 shows that by @xmath101yr , @xmath29 has decreased by at least a factor of 10 from its initial value for all radii .",
    "were this purely the result of viscous evolution , we would see such clearing only for @xmath102 . in short",
    ", the clearing at all radii out to @xmath103 illustrates the initial influence of @xmath104 spiral waves followed by the subsequent influence of @xmath81 spiral waves .",
    "we can define the hole formation time as the time scale at which the surface density at @xmath105 drops by factor of 10 .",
    "we use this radius since , as discussed above , the gap opens from @xmath106 .",
    "thus the hole formation represents the remaining clearing inside @xmath105 . the mass scaling for the hole clearing time scale can be estimated using @xmath107 and the third term of eq . ( 1 ) .",
    "measured in units of the planet s orbit period , the result is @xmath108 where the numerical coefficient @xmath109 comes from the simulations ( e.g. fig .",
    "1 ) while the parameter scalings come from the theory .",
    "the result ( [ hole ] ) is @xmath110 the viscous time at @xmath111 and @xmath109 times the viscous time at @xmath40 .",
    "finally , we point out that for a planet to have any observable effect , it must form faster than the migration time scale at its formation location . in our planet - disk simulations , we imposed a planet at @xmath112 , so the planet formation time scale is unspecified .",
    "however , a constraint emerges . if the planet growth time is long compared to the hole formation time scale , @xmath113 , then a spectral hole should always accompany the planet . if instead the planet formation time , @xmath114 , then the fraction of systems with a planet but without a hole , would be @xmath115 , and @xmath116 is the migration time at the planet s inferred location . from the simulations , we find that @xmath117 ( where the equality corresponds to @xmath118 with @xmath119 ) .",
    "then , using ( [ hole ] ) @xmath120 .",
    "our key result , that massive planets rapidly form spectral holes in disks , thus implies : ( 1 ) for planet formation on a time scale @xmath121 , all disks with a massive planet will have a sharply bounded hole from outer radius @xmath122 to inner radius @xmath123 .",
    "( 2 ) for @xmath124 , a fraction @xmath125 of disks with a massive planet would show a sharply bounded gap from @xmath126 to @xmath127 .",
    "( 3 ) however , since @xmath125 is small for massive planets .",
    "therefore , disks which appear to show gaps but not holes @xcite are best explained either by planets with low enough mass to make @xmath113 as long as the viscous time ( in which case only the early gap formation is observed ) , or by spectral features from dust and inclination effects without a planet .",
    "we find that a massive planet embedded in a protoplanetary accretion disk can produce a low surface density hole faster than can be accounted for by purely viscous evolution .",
    "in particular , ( 1 ) after less than @xmath33 orbits a very low surface density gap forms that extends approximately 1/3 the distance to the star . ( 2 ) by about @xmath101 orbits , a low surface density hole , with a factor of @xmath35 density depletion extending all the way from the planet orbital radius to the stellar surface appears on a time scale @xmath110 of the viscous evolution time calculated at @xmath111 .",
    "the gap and hole are consistently interpreted to be the result of the enhanced angular momentum transport and accretion induced by spiral waves @xcite .",
    "we find that the gap can be explained by the launching and damping of of @xmath104 waves and the faster - than - viscous hole formation is consistent with launching and damping of @xmath81 waves .",
    "our results are consistent with previous studies of gap formation and the theory of takeuchi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) but we have followed the evolution of the disk long much longer than in previous simulations @xcite and we are able to see the hole clear all the way to the star .",
    "our results imply that spectral holes could be more common than spectral gaps when a sufficiently massive planet is present inside a disk .",
    "we also emphasize that the use of the term `` spectral hole '' is important because even though the holes have a reduced density for all @xmath128 , they need not be fully evacuated and substantial accretion rates can be maintained even after the hole forms .",
