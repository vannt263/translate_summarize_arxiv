    "this is clearly not the case for the function @xmath82 displayed in fig .",
    "one can directly convince oneself that this aspect is of no consequence to our conclusions to be arrived at in this section . to this end",
    ", one should consider the fact that @xmath103 remain the exact zeros of @xmath82 on replacing @xmath91 and @xmath18 by @xmath104 and @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is a non - vanishing but otherwise arbitrary positive constant .",
    "this implies that for in particular @xmath90 , through a simple re - scaling of the parameters @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath0 , one will be able to render @xmath82 as small as desired for all @xmath107 .",
    "one can readily verify that such uniform scaling of the above - mentioned parameters _ can not _",
    "lead to any change in the conclusions of our analysis to be presented below ( with the aid of the details that we present in appendix [ saa ] , the reader may verify this statement through explicit calculations ) .",
    "one should in addition note that since the smallest @xmath47 that we consider in our following investigations is equal to @xmath108 , eq .",
    "( [ e8 ] ) , we never probe @xmath82 farther from @xmath109 than @xmath110 on either side of this point .",
    "consequently , for our specific considerations in this paper it is entirely irrelevant what non - vanishing magnitude @xmath82 has outside the interval @xmath111 $ ] ( and by symmetry , also outside the interval @xmath112 $ ] ) .",
    "secondly , concentrating on the half - filled gss ( see eq .",
    "( [ e7 ] ) ) , we assume that the expression for @xmath113 in eq .",
    "( [ e10 ] ) applies for _ all _ @xmath47 , so that by increasing the value of @xmath47 one merely samples the _ same _ function at a more dense set of @xmath43 points of which the @xmath21 in eq .",
