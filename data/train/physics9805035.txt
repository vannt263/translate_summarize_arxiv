    "electromagnetic scintillation calorimeters are an important part of many elementary particle detectors .",
    "one of the most complicated problems of such calorimeters is the energy calibration , i.e. determination of coefficients , needed for conversion of electrical signals from the calorimeter into corresponding energy depositions , measured in units of mev .",
    "commonly used for that purpose are particles , producing known energy depositions in the calorimeter counters , e.g. gamma quanta from radioactive sources , cosmic muons , or particle beams .    cosmic radiation is a continuos and freely available source of charged particles . at the sea level the main part of them",
    "is represented by muons @xmath3 , having high enough energies @xmath4 to traverse the whole detector . in the calorimeter",
    "counters muons loose energy due to ionization of the medium .",
    "the average ionization losses are close to 5 mev / cm in nai(tl ) . with reasonable accuracy one can also assume , that the trajectory of the muon is a straight line and that energy is left mainly in the counters crossed by this line .",
    "cosmic calibration of the snd calorimeter is a preliminary stage before the final calibration .",
    "its goal is to obtain approximate values of the constants for the calculation of energy depositions .",
    "these constants are needed to level responses of all crystals in order to obtain equal first level trigger energy threshold over the whole calorimeter .",
    "they are also used as seed values for a precise off - line calibration procedure , based on analysis of bhabha events .",
    "the requirements for the cosmic calibration procedure are the following : the calibration procedure must take not more than 12 hours , it must be independent of the other detector systems , and statistical errors in the conversion coefficients must be less than @xmath5 .",
    "the scheme of this procedure was briefly described in @xcite .",
    "its important feature is that it makes use of virtually all muons detected in the calorimeter , greatly reducing the time required for calibration . in many other implementations of cosmic calibration ,",
    "e.g. in the l3 detector at lep @xcite , muons , traversing the detector only in certain directions , were selected .",
    "the snd detector @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) consists of two cylindrical drift chambers for charge particle tracking , calorimeter , and a muon system .    the main part of the detector is a three - layer spherical calorimeter , based on nai(tl ) crystals .",
    "the pairs of counters of the two inner layers , with thickness of 2.9 and 4.8 @xmath6 respectively , where @xmath7 is a radiation length , are sealed in thin aluminum containers , fixed to an aluminum supporting hemisphere . behind it , the third layer of nai(tl ) crystals , 5.7 @xmath6 thick , is placed ( fig .",
    "the total thickness of the calorimeter for particles , originating from the center of the detector , is equal to 34.7 cm ( 13.4 @xmath6 ) .",
    "the total number of counters is 1632 , the number of crystals per layer varies from 520 to 560 .",
    "the angular dimensions of the most of crystals are @xmath8 , the total solid angle is @xmath9 of @xmath10 .",
    "the electronics channel ( fig .  [ f5 ] ) consists of :    1 .",
    "phototriode with an average quantum efficiency of the photocathode for the nai(tl ) emission spectrum of about @xmath11 and gain of about 10 @xcite .",
    "the light collection efficiency varies from 7 to 15 @xmath12 for different calorimeter layers , 2 .",
    "charge sensitive preamplifier ( csa ) with a conversion coefficient of   0.7  v / pc , 3 .",
    "12-channel shaping amplifier ( sha ) with a remote controlled gain that can be set to any value in the range from 0 to a maximum with a resolution of 1/255 .",
    "24-channel 12 bit analog to digital converter ( adc ) with a maximum input signal @xmath13 , 5 .",
    "in addition the sha produces special signals for the first level trigger , the most important of which is the analog sum of all calorimeter channels  the total energy deposition .",
    "each calorimeter channel can be tested using a precision computer controlled calibration generator .",
    "the amplitude of its signal can be set to any value from 0 to 1 v with a resolution of 1/4096 .",
    "the equivalent electronics noise of individual calorimeter counters lies within a range of 150 - 350 kev .",
    "the calibration procedure is based on the comparison of experimental energy depositions in the calorimeter crystals for cosmic muons with monte carlo simulation .",
    "the simulation was carried out by means of the unimod2 @xcite code , developed for simulation of @xmath0 colliding beam experiments .",
    "simulated were muons crossing the sphere with a radius of 80 cm , centered at the beam crossing point , and containing all calorimeter crystals .",
    "the cosmic muon generation program is based on data from @xcite .",
    "experimental data on the energy and angular spectra of cosmic muons were approximated using the following formula : @xmath14,\\ ] ] where @xmath15  the flux of muons with a momentum of @xmath16 at @xmath17 , @xmath18  angle between the muon momentum and vertical direction , @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the data from @xcite , on the relative abundances of positive and negative muons , were approximated using the following expression : @xmath21.\\ ] ] the passage of particles through the detector was simulated by means of the unimod2 code . as a result",
    "the energy depositions in the calorimeter crystals were calculated in each event .",
    "a total of 1 000 000 cosmic events were simulated .",
    "the simulated events were processed as follows .",
    "the track of cosmic muon was fitted to the hit crystals and expected track lengths in each crystal were calculated .",
    "energy depositions @xmath22 and track lengths @xmath23 were summed over event sample for each crystal separately and for each crystal their ratio was calculated : @xmath24 .",
    "brackets denote averaging over event samples .",
    "then the calorimeter channels were calibrated electronically , using the generator . in order to account for the electronics nonlinearity ,",
    "the calibration data were taken at two significantly different values of sha gain and wide range of calibration generator amplitudes , covering the whole dynamic range of the adcs .",
    "in addition , data were taken at a working value of the sha gain .    using all these data and assuming that the dependence of the adc counts @xmath25 on the generator amplitude @xmath26 is described by a second order polynomial , and that the generator amplitude itself linearly depends on generator code , one can obtain @xmath27 constants , defined by the following expressions : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are a generator code and pedestal respectively , @xmath31 - the relative sha gain .",
    "the next step is to obtain from these intermediate results the final constants @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 for the working values of sha gain , from the knowledge of which one can calculate the equivalent generator code @xmath29 for any measured adc count : @xmath35 it relates an adc count to a corresponding generator code , which allows the linearization of the adc response .",
    "the next stage is processing of the experimental events . about 1.5 million events ( fig .",
    "[ f9 ] ) are needed to be collected in special data taking runs with total duration of 4.5 hours .",
    "the processing itself is the same as that of the simulated events , but now the initial adc counts are first transformed into equivalent generator codes . as a result , values of @xmath36 for each crystal are obtained .",
    "the meaning of @xmath37 is a code , which should be written into the generator to produce signals on csa input , equivalent to an average input signal produced by a 1 cm long muon track .    using @xmath38 and @xmath39 ,",
    "for each crystal we can calculate @xmath40 an equivalent generator code , corresponding to an energy deposition of 1 mev in a crystal .",
    "then the gains of the sha channels are adjusted to equalize contributions of different crystals into the total energy deposition signal and the final generator calibration pass is carried out .",
    "it yields the coefficients @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , needed to transform @xmath25 into mev according to the following formula : @xmath44    the use of the precision generator as a reference calibration source is very convenient not only because its linearity is much higher than that of the adc , but it also simplifies the replacement of any element of the electronics channel , except the cpa or generator itself .",
    "all what is needed after that is to recalibrate the calorimeter with the generator .",
    "the goal of the experimental and simulated events processing is to obtain the normalized ratios @xmath39 and @xmath38 . the need for normalization of the energy deposition to the unit track length in a crystal arises from the fact that the raw energy deposition spectra in crystals are very wide and have very weakly pronounced maxima . on the other hand ,",
    "such a normalization reduces systematic errors due to possible differences in the angular distributions of simulated and real muons , and differences in the directions of crystals axes over the calorimeter .",
    "the simulated and experimental events are processed using the same computer code .",
    "the only difference is that before processing of a simulated event it is checked for passing the experimental trigger .",
    "the following selection criteria are used for event selection : the total number of hit crystals must be from 5 to 25 .",
    "crystals with energy depositions smaller than the threshold value ( currently 5 mev ) are discarded . similarly discarded are crystals with adc counts less than 20 .",
    "an event is selected if more than four hit crystals survive these cuts .",
    "for those crystals a straight line is fitted , using a least squares method , i. e. the sum of squares of distances from the crystal centers to the line is minimized .",
    "the line is parametrized as : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is an arbitrary point on the line , @xmath47 is a unitary vector in the direction of the line , @xmath48  parameter .",
    "then , the squared distance from the center of i - th crystal to the line is : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a radius - vector of the crystal center .",
    "the minimized function is : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is assumed to be equal to a half height of an i - th crystal .",
    "one point on a line can be determined immediately : @xmath53 the direction of vector @xmath47 , is determined by a maximum of the quadratic form @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 in other words , @xmath47 must have the same direction as an eigenvector of @xmath32 , matrix of this quadratic form , corresponding to its maximal eigenvalue . here",
    "@xmath56 @xmath57  coordinate indices .",
    "the equation for @xmath47 was solved using an iterative procedure : @xmath58    as seed value the unitary vector in the direction of the line between the centers of the two most distant crystals in the event is used . on each iteration step the presence of hit crystals at distances greater than @xmath59 from the line",
    "is checked .",
    "if such crystals exist , two options are considered .",
    "the first one is to remove the most distant crystal from the list , the second one is to remove the crystal , most distant from the point @xmath60 .",
    "for both cases the fitting of the line is repeated and the final choice is based on the minimal value of @xmath61 . if there are more than one crystal to be discarded then the event is rejected completely . from the remaining events",
    "only those are selected where @xmath61 divided by the number of hit crystals is less than 0.7 ( fig .",
    "[ f7 ] ) .",
    "after that , the expected lengths of the muon track @xmath62 in each crystal are calculated and averaged over the whole event sample together with the energy depositions @xmath63 .",
    "the values of average track lengths @xmath64 and energy depositions @xmath65 are used then to calculate the energy deposition per unit track length @xmath66 . here",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath68 are the crystal and the event numbers , respectively .    to estimate the statistical error in @xmath69 , the event sample is divided into groups of 50 events each and within each group the ratio @xmath70 is calculated .",
    "then , the error @xmath71 in @xmath69 can be estimated as @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is a number of groups .",
    "the total cpu time , required for processing of @xmath74 cosmic events is 2.5 hours on vaxstation  4000/60 .",
    "the mean @xmath75 and their rms values are shown in the table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the necessity of normalization of energy depositions in crystals to a unitary track length was studied . to this",
    "end the events with muons going through drift chamber were processed , and the corresponding @xmath76 coefficients were calculated .",
    "the ratios of @xmath77 and their rms are also presented in the table  [ tab1 ] together with the corresponding ratios of mean energy depositions @xmath78 .",
    "the data show , that the normalization significantly reduces the dependence of coefficients on the angular distribution of muons .",
    "the distributions of experimental events over number of hit crystals with energy depositions higher than threshold value and over @xmath61 are in good agreement with the simulated ones ( fig .",
    "[ f6 ] ,  [ f7 ] ) .",
    "small differences between experimental and simulated distributions may be attributed to inaccuracies in the angular and energy spectra of the primary particles and first level trigger simulation .",
    "this also may cause small differences in the distributions over the angle relative to vertical direction ( fig .",
    "[ f10 ] ) . shown in fig .",
    "[ f12 ] are distributions over total energy deposition in the detector , normalized to a unitary track length also agree well .    a comparison of average track lengths of muons in the calorimeter crystals for the experimental and simulated events was carried out .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "the statistical uncertainty of the @xmath37 coefficients is less than @xmath79 for all three layers of the calorimeter . at the same time the uncertainties of the corresponding coefficients for simulated events",
    "are determined by simulation statistics .",
    "the energy resolution of the calorimeter was studied using @xmath80 and @xmath81 processes .",
    "the energy distributions for electrons are depicted in fig .",
    "[ f131 ] . the events with polar angles of the particles in the range @xmath82 degrees and acollinearity angle less than 10 degrees were selected .",

    "@xmath32 , @xmath86 , @xmath88 , and @xmath87 were treated as free parameters during fitting .",
    "energy resolution was defined as @xmath89 .",
    "experimental and monte carlo resolutions of the calorimeter at 500 mev are respectively @xmath90 and @xmath91 for photons and @xmath92 and @xmath93 for electrons .",
    "peak and mean values of the experimental and simulated distributions agree to a level of about @xmath79 , but the widths of experimental distributions are significantly larger",
    ". the possible explanation of the broadening of the experimental spectra could be electronics instability , systematic errors in calibration procedure and nonuniformity of light collection efficiency over the crystal volume .",
    "study of the electronics and photodetector stability showed , that it can attribute to a maximum of @xmath79 shifts for the time duration of the collection of energy deposition spectra .",
    "systematic biases were estimated by comparison of the calibration coefficients with those obtained using a special procedure based on minimization of the width of the energy deposition spectrum in the calorimeter for @xmath0 events .",
    "such a calibration was carried out using experimental statistics collected in 1996 @xcite .",
    "the average bias of coefficients relatively to those obtained with cosmic calibration was @xmath94 for the first layer .",
    "no statistically significant bias was found in other two layers .",
    "the rms difference in calibration coefficients , obtained using cosmic and @xmath0 calibration procedures is close to @xmath95 .",
    "the resulting energy resolution after @xmath0 calibration was close to @xmath96 for photons and @xmath97 for electrons , which is still worse than that expected from monte carlo simulation .",
    "a monte carlo simulation was carried out taking into account a nonuniformity of light collection efficiency over the crystal volume .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ f132 ] together with the experimental distribution .",
    "the energy resolution for simulated events decreased to @xmath98 .",
    "it shows that the broadening of experimental spectra was mainly determined by the nonuniformity of light collection efficiency over the crystal volume .",
    "the cosmic calibration procedure was used during a five month experiment with snd at vepp-2 m in 1996 @xcite .",
    "relative shifts in calibration coefficients are shown in fig .",
    "it can be seen , that for a one week period between consecutive calibrations , the mean shift of the coefficients is less than @xmath99 and rms of their random spread is @xmath100 .",
    "with the help of the described procedure of snd calorimeter calibration a statistical accuracy of @xmath79 in calibration coefficients and energy resolution of @xmath91 for 500 mev electromagnetic showers was achieved .",
