    "the spectrum and structure of baryons with nonvanishing strangeness ( @xmath17 ) quantum number , the hyperons ( @xmath4 ) , are currently much less understood than the @xmath19 and @xmath20 excited states of the nucleon .",
    "as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the past partial - wave analyses  @xcite for investigating @xmath4 were mostly performed using the breit - wigner parametrization and did not extract the resonance parameters defined by the poles and residues of the scattering amplitudes . in fact , the values of poles and residues for the @xmath4 resonances are not given by the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite , unlike the @xmath19 and @xmath20 resonances .",
    "to establish the @xmath4 mass spectrum , more extensive investigations are needed theoretically and experimentally .    in this work ,",
    "we develop a dynamical coupled - channels ( dcc ) model for antikaon - nucleon ( @xmath21 ) reactions within a hamiltonian formulation developed in refs .",
    "the @xmath5 reactions are particularly suitable for studying @xmath4 with @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , since those appear as direct @xmath25-channel processes in the reactions . following the formulation of ref .",
    "@xcite , we derive the model hamiltonian by using the unitary transformation method .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian consists of ( a )  meson - baryon ( @xmath1 ) potentials @xmath2 derived from the phenomenological su(3 ) lagrangian , and ( b )  vertex interactions @xmath3 for describing the decays of bare excited hyperon states ( @xmath26 ) into @xmath1 states .",
    "one can show that resulting coupled - channels scattering amplitudes satisfy the multichannel unitarity conditions .",
    "furthermore , they account for the dynamical effects arising from the off - shell rescattering processes .",
    "we will apply the model to analyze all of the available data of the unpolarized and polarized observables of the @xmath27 reactions from the threshold up to @xmath15 gev , where @xmath28 is the total scattering energy in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "the @xmath21 reaction data included in our analysis are similar to those used in the partial - wave analysis by the kent state university ( ksu ) group  @xcite .",
    "it is useful to note here that there are some connections and differences between our dynamical approach and the ksu analysis . in their single - energy partial - wave analysis , a multichannel @xmath29-matrix model developed by manley  @xcite",
    "was used to guide / constrain their determinations of partial - wave amplitudes from fitting the data .",
    "it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that this @xmath29-matrix model can be derived from a dynamical model based on a hamiltonian , such as the one employed in this work , by taking the on - shell approximation to evaluate the meson - baryon propagators in the scattering equations .",
    "the full amplitudes in both approaches can be written in terms of vertices @xmath30 describing the decay of the excited baryons ( @xmath31 @xmath19 , @xmath20 or @xmath4 ) into @xmath1 states and the `` background '' scattering @xmath32 matrix @xmath33 between the considered @xmath1 states .",
    "the parameters associated with the vertices @xmath30 are treated purely phenomenologically .",
    "the main differences between two approaches are in the treatments of @xmath33 . in our dynamical approach , the on- and off - shell matrix elements of @xmath33 in _",
    "all _ partial waves are determined by the _",
    "same _ parameters of the constructed meson - exchange potentials @xmath34 . in the ksu approach",
    ", the needed background scattering matrix @xmath35 defined by the on - shell matrix elements of @xmath33 are parametrized in terms of unitary matrices and their parameters in each partial wave are adjusted independently of other partial waves in fitting the data .",
    "this difference makes the ksu approach more efficient in fitting the data . perhaps mainly because the amount and the quality of the data in each energy bin ( @xmath36 mev ) could be very different , the partial - wave amplitudes determined in the ksu s single - energy analysis could be not smooth in energy .",
    "thus they impose `` smoothness '' as an additional condition in finalizing their results .",
    "this is a reasonable approach since they also verify their final results by showing that the observables calculated from their partial - wave amplitudes are in agreement with the data . in our dynamical approach ,",
    "the parameters associated with the potential @xmath34 and the vertices @xmath30 are adjusted to fit the data of observables in all considered energies .",
    "thus the determined partial - wave amplitudes in all partial waves depend on the _ same _ set of the parameters of the constructed meson - baryon potentials .",
    "this makes the fits to the data of the observables of @xmath21 reactions more difficult than the ksu analysis .",
    "furthermore , solving the coupled - channels equations in a dynamical approach is rather time consuming .    as discussed previously  @xcite ,",
    "the purpose of taking a much more complicated dynamical model to analyze the meson - baryon reaction data is not only to determine the partial - wave amplitudes for resonance extractions , but also to provide an understanding of the dynamical content of the extracted baryon resonances .",
    "here we further point out the following three motivations of our approach :    1 .",
    "it is well recognized , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , that the data from complete or overcomplete measurements are needed to have a model _ independent _ ( up to a common phase ) determination of partial - wave amplitudes for extracting hadron resonances . as will be detailed in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , the data needed for our analysis are still rather incomplete . thus it is desirable to fit the available data within a reaction model that is constrained by the well - established physics .",
    "our dcc model and a similar coupled - channels model developed in the jlich @xmath37 analysis  @xcite are constrained by the meson - exchange mechanisms .",
    "both approaches are motivated by the success of the meson - exchange models of @xmath38 interactions  @xcite and @xmath37 and @xmath39 reactions in the @xmath40 ( 1232 ) region  @xcite .",
    "thus there are good reasons to assume that a dcc model , as formulated in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , can minimize the uncertainties due to the lack of complete data in extracting nucleon resonances .",
    "our motivation here is similar to the dispersion - relation approaches  @xcite . to reduce the experimental uncertainties in determining partial - wave amplitudes for resonance extractions ,",
    "it is necessary to impose various theoretical assumptions , such as the choices of the subtraction terms , the input needed for crossing symmetry , and the asymptotic behavior of the amplitudes , to solve the considered dispersion relations .",
    "2 .   to extract resonances from the data , the parametrization of the scattering amplitudes should have essential analytical properties such as the left - hand cuts and @xmath41 and @xmath42 cut singularities .",
    "these properties can be built in straightforwardly by defining our model hamiltonian in terms of the meson - exchange mechanisms .",
    "consequently , the background amplitudes of different partial waves are determined simultaneously , while the ksu model and other similar analysis models  @xcite do not have this advantage .",
    "3 .   the dynamical model constructed in this work can make predictions on some unmeasurable transition amplitudes with theoretical constraints , while the pure phenomenological models such as the ksu model can not .",
    "in addition , our model can account for the off - shell effects due to the @xmath21 rescattering processes .",
    "those effects are known to be important for a quantitative understanding of the production of hypernuclei and kaonic nuclei in kaon - induced nuclear reactions  @xcite .",
    "our dynamical model thus has a great advantage also in the applications to various reaction systems in the strangeness sector that are relevant to the recent experimental efforts at j - parc  @xcite .    here",
    "we also note that most of the previous investigations of @xmath4 based on coupled - channels models ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) focus on studying the resonances extracted from the @xmath17-wave amplitudes of @xmath21 scattering at low energies .",
    "higher partial waves were also considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the channels and the data considered in this analysis are much more limited than what we will present in this paper .",
    "similarly , a coupled - channels @xmath5 model developed in ref .",
    "@xcite is also limited to the threshold region .",
    "there also exist model studies based on tree diagrams ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) of @xmath4 , which are obviously different from the coupled - channels approaches . in parallel with extracting the @xmath4 resonance parameters from the experimental data on the basis of reaction approaches ,",
    "there are activities to compute the real energy spectrum of qcd in the @xmath22 hyperon sector within the lattice qcd framework  @xcite by imposing the ( anti)periodic boundary condition .",
    "furthermore , several attempts are also performed to extract complex resonance parameters from such real energy spectrum of qcd ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "our first task is to determine the model parameters by fitting the available data of @xmath0 reactions from the threshold to @xmath15 gev .",
    "the partial - wave amplitudes of the @xmath21 reactions obtained from the constructed models are then compared with the results from the recent single - energy partial - wave analysis  @xcite of the ksu group .",
    "these two results will be presented in this paper .",
