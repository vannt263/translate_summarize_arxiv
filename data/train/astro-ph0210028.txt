    "excitation of solar - type oscillations results from turbulent movements in the upper convective zone of intermediate mass stars ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the rate @xmath3 at which a given mode with frequency @xmath6 is excited crucially depends on the time averaged and _ dynamic _ properties of the turbulent medium ( samadi 2001 ) .",
    "different models for stochastic excitation have been proposed by several authors ( e.g. goldreich & keeley 1977 ; balmforth 1992 ; goldreich et al .",
    "1994 ; samadi & goupil 2001 ) . the model of samadi & goupil ( 2001 ,",
    "paper  i hereafter , see also samadi ( 2001 ) ) takes into account the frequency dependence @xmath7 of the correlation product of the turbulent velocity field .",
    "this last quantity characterizes the dynamic properties of the turbulence .",
    "this excitation model offers then the advantage to test different hypothesis concerning the dynamic properties of the turbulent medium .",
    "a gaussian function is usally assumed for @xmath7 ( e.g. goldreich & keeley 1977 ) .",
    "however recently , using 3d numerical simulation of the upper part of the solar convective zone , samadi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have shown that the gaussian model indeed does not correctly model @xmath7 in the frequency range where the acoustic energy injected into the solar @xmath0-modes is important ( @xmath8  mhz ) .",
    "one must consider an additional non - gaussian component for @xmath7 to reproduce its behavior .",
    "computed values of @xmath1 obtained with this non - gaussian component reproduce better the solar seismic observations .    in the present work we study the consequences of this non - gaussian component for the stochastic excitation of @xmath0-modes in intermediate mass stars .",
    "1 describes the stochastic excitation model we consider and sumarizes samadi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) s results which establish the non gaussian character of the stochastic excitation . in sect .",
    "2 we compute @xmath1 for different stellar models with masses in the mass range @xmath2 . in the computation",
    "we assume two hypotheses for @xmath7 : the gaussian function and a non gaussian function as inferred in samadi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) from a 3d simulation .",
    "the theoretical expression in paper  i for the excitation rate @xmath1 can be written in a schematic form as : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are related to the local turbulence : @xmath10 is the distance between two given points in the turbulent medium and @xmath11 is the time correlation between the two distant points ( @xmath11 is associated with the eddy lifetime which is typically much shorter than the oscillations lifetime ) . in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : p ] ) , @xmath12 denotes the radial mode eigenfunction and @xmath13 the correlation product of the excitation source versus @xmath14 and @xmath11 .",
    "the excitation source ( @xmath15 ) originates from the turbulent reynolds stress and the advection of the turbulent entropy fluctuations by the turbulent motions .",
    "@xmath13 is expressed in terms of the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum @xmath16 and the spectrum of the entropy fluctuations @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the wavenumber of a given turbulent element .",
    "further @xmath16 is split into a spatial component @xmath19 and a frequency component @xmath7 according to stein ( 1967 ) as @xmath20 the same decomposition is assumed for @xmath17 .    in the calculation of @xmath3 , a gaussian shape",
    "is usually assumed for @xmath7 ( e.g. goldreich & keeley 1977 ) .",
    "this assumption is equivalent to suppose that two distant points in the turbulent medium are uncorrelated .",
    "such gaussian function ( gf hereafter ) has the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the line - width at half maximum .    with the help of a 3d numerical simulation of the upper part of the solar convective zone , it is found in samadi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) that the gf does not reproduced correctly the frequency dependence of @xmath23 inferred from the 3d simulation . in contrat , @xmath23 is better modeled by the gaussian plus an exponential function ( gef hereafter ) as : @xmath24",
    "we compute several stellar models with masses @xmath25 and with the same age ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "calculations are carried out with the cesam evolutionary code in which the convective heat flux is computed according to the classical mixing - length theory by bhm - vitense ( 1958 ) .",
    "the eigenfunctions are obtained from the adiabatic filou pulsation code by tran minh & leon ( 1995 ) .",
    "the input physics are similar to those of samadi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) except for the atmosphere which is computed with the eddington classical gray atmosphere for sake of simplicity .",
    "we compute @xmath1 for each the stellar model according to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : p ] ) . in the calculation , we assume successively for @xmath7  : the gaussian model ( gf , eq .  [ eqn : gf ] ) and the non gaussian model ( gef , eq .",
    "[ eqn : gef ] ) .",
    "a scaling factor is introduced such that for the solar model the maximum in @xmath1 matches the solar seismic constraints by chaplin et al .",
    "results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmp_pow_gexp_m100_m200 ] .    for all stellar models ,",
    "the largest differences in @xmath1 between calculations performed with the gf and those performed with the gef are obtained for @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the frequency at which @xmath1 is maximum .",
    "this feature is a direct a consequence of the difference in the frequency dependence of the gf and the gef .",
    "indeed , the gef decreases with @xmath6 slower than the gf does for @xmath29 .",
    "moreover @xmath28 scales approximatively as @xmath30 where @xmath30 is the characteristic frequency associated with the largest energy - bearing eddy located at the top of superadiabatic ( this is the region where the excitation is the largest ) .",
    "the eddies who excite the most the modes have their characteristic frequency @xmath31 . consequently for @xmath32 a larger amount of acoustic energy is injected with the gef than the gf .",
    "the largest effects in @xmath1 of the dynamic model adopted for @xmath23 are obtained for the @xmath33 and @xmath34 stellar models  : let @xmath35 be the difference in @xmath1 between calculations performed with the gf and those performed with the gef .",
    "@xmath35 is found larger for these two models than for the other stellar models .",
    "moreover @xmath35 takes large values over a larger range in @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the cut - off frequency ( @xmath37 delimits the extend of frequency domain where modes have a significant amplitude ) .",
    "these features are due to the fact that the characteristic turbulent mach number , @xmath38 , is the highest for stars with mass @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , @xmath39 , the maximum in @xmath35 , scales approximatively as @xmath40 where @xmath41 . as @xmath42 scales as @xmath43 and @xmath30 scales approximatively as @xmath44 , @xmath39 increases then as @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , let @xmath46 be the frequency domain where @xmath47 where @xmath48 is arbitrarily fixed to a value @xmath49 .",
    "in other words @xmath46 defines a domain where @xmath35 is `` large '' .",
    "one shows that @xmath50 scales as @xmath51 and then @xmath52 . as a consequence @xmath53 . the domain",
    "@xmath54 then scales as @xmath55 .",
    "the present work illustrates that a non gaussian model of stochastic excitation substantially changes the shape and the magnitude of the calculated excitation spectrum @xmath1 of the oscillations in intermediate mass star more massive than the sun .",
    "differences in @xmath1 between computation carried out with the non gaussian excitation model and this carried out with the common gaussian model are found larger for the frequency modes above the frequency @xmath28 at which @xmath1 peaks .",
    "the largest effects are expected for stars in the mass range @xmath4 .",
    "they are found large enough to be discriminate from space based experiences with performances equivalent or higher than those of the corot intrument ( baglin et al . 1998 ) ."
