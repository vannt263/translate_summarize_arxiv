    "section  [ larged ] treats the large - dimensionality expansion of the critical coupling , and in sect .",
    "[ perc ] the case of bond percolation , i.e. , the limit @xmath11 is analyzed .",
    "we end with a short summary in sect .",
    "let @xmath13 be an undirected graph , that is a set @xmath14 of vertices together with a set @xmath15 of edges defining which pairs of vertices are considered `` nearest neighbors '' . put a spin @xmath16 on each vertex @xmath17 which can take @xmath0 different values . the @xmath0-state potts model ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) on this graph",
    "is then defined by the hamiltonian @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the kronecker delta symbol .",
    "the fortuin - kasteleyn representation shows that the partition function @xmath20 for a finite graph @xmath21 is actually a polynomial in @xmath0 and @xmath22 : @xmath23 here the sum is over all @xmath24 clusters , i.e. subsets @xmath25 of the set @xmath15 of edges ; @xmath26 is the number of connected components where each isolated vertex is counted as one component and @xmath27 is the number of edges of @xmath25 .",
    "this allows one to study the model for arbitrary values of @xmath28 which can no longer be represented by a local interaction of spin degrees of freedom of the original hamiltonian ( [ eq : h1 ] ) .",
    "of special interest in statistical physics are the limits @xmath29 and @xmath30 which can be shown to be related to percolation and tree percolation on the graph @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "a two - point correlation function can be defined in the cluster representation simply by @xmath31 where the cluster sum is restricted to those clusters @xmath32 in which the vertices @xmath33 and @xmath34 belong to the same connected component . the susceptibility related to this correlator",
    ", @xmath35 equals for @xmath36 the usual magnetic susceptibility of the @xmath0-state potts model in the high - temperature phase ( i.e. , as long as @xmath37 ) .    in the case",
    "@xmath11 the weight of a cluster in the partition sum depends only on its number of edges .",
    "this case therefore describes bond percolation where the local bond probability is given by @xmath38 .",
    "it easily follows that here the susceptibility @xmath39 measures the average size of the percolation cluster .",
    "the potts partition function @xmath40 is essentially equivalent to the tutte or dichromatic polynomial of the graph @xmath21 , see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "it encodes a lot of combinatorical properties of the graph such as the number of spanning trees , the number of spanning forests , the number of possible acyclic orientations , or the number of vertex colourings with @xmath0 different colours using different colours on neighbouring vertices .",
    "the last mentioned number , for example , equals @xmath41 , which is the number of ground states of the antiferromagnetic @xmath0-state potts model on the graph @xmath21 .    in statistical physics , on the other hand",
    ", the interest in these models is related to the existence of a phase transition between a disordered high - temperature ( low - density in case of percolation clusters ) and an ordered low - temperature ( large @xmath42 ) phase if we go to infinite graphs like the @xmath1-dimensional hypercubic lattice @xmath43 .",
    "depending on @xmath0 and @xmath1 , these transitions can be first or second order .",
    "whereas in @xmath44 dimensions many exact results are available showing that the second - order nature changes to first - order for @xmath45 , in @xmath46 and higher dimensions there is strong numerical evidence that the transition is of first order for all integer values @xmath47 . in the case of a second - order phase transition at @xmath48 , the behavior of the susceptibility",
    "is characterized by the critical exponent @xmath7 : @xmath49 .",
    "series expansions are an important tool for the extraction of information on statistical systems which is exact ( up to the order of the expansion ) in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "there exist different well - established methods @xcite for the systematic generation of high - temperature series expansions , as for example the linked cluster and the star - graph method .",
    "the latter one got its name from the fact that only 1-vertex - irreducible graphs contribute to the series . in an attempt to study systems with quenched disorder via series expansions @xcite we used this method and developed a comprehensive software toolbox for generating and enumerating star graphs",
    "which is re - used in this work .",
    "the basic idea of the star - graph method is to assemble the value of some extensive thermodynamic quantity @xmath50 on a large or even infinite graph from its values on subgraphs : graphs constitute a partially ordered set under the `` subgraph '' relation .",
    "therefore , for every function @xmath51 defined on the set of graphs exists another function @xmath52 such that for all graphs @xmath21 @xmath53 and this function can be calculated recursively via @xmath54 this gives for an infinite ( e.g. hypercubic ) lattice @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the weak embedding number of the graph @xmath21 in the given lattice structure  @xcite .",
    "the following observation makes this a useful method : let @xmath21 be a graph with an articulation vertex where two star subgraphs @xmath57 are glued together . then @xmath52 vanishes if @xmath58 an observable @xmath50 for which eq .",
    "( [ eq : sg ] ) is true on arbitrary graphs with articulation points allows a star - graph expansion",

    "( [ eq:4 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the ( properly normalized ) free energy @xmath60 has this property and it can be shown that the inverse susceptibility @xmath61 has it , too .",
    "the weak embedding numbers @xmath62 of a graph @xmath21 into the hypercubic lattice are counted using a refined version of the backtracing algorithm by martin @xcite , making use of a couple of simplifications for bipartite hypercubic lattices @xmath63 .",

    "these extrapolation techniques are not rigorous .",
    "they make some assumptions about the expected form of the singularity at the critical temperature .",
    "usually , error estimates rely on the scatter of the results of extrapolations with different parameters ( like @xmath77 $ ] pad approximants for different values of @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) .",
    "this may seriously underestimate systematic errors coming from wrong assumptions about the structure of the singularity .    in order to get a reliable picture",

    "several remarks are in order :    * at the upper critical dimension ( @xmath88 for @xmath73 , @xmath89 for @xmath11 ) the dlog - pad analysis finds a value @xmath90 slightly larger than @xmath91 .",
    "this effect is well - known and due to the existence of logarithmic corrections . * for @xmath92",
    "the phase transition is of first order and the correlation length remains finite . in analysing high - temperature series by pad approximants or similar techniques",
