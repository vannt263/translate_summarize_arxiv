    "the understanding of intermediate - energy ( 0.510 gev ) neutrino - nucleus scattering cross sections is an important ingredient to atmospheric and accelerator - based neutrino oscillation experiments  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of these experiments requires having good control of nuclear effects .",
    "the simple description based on a relativistic fermi gas ( rfg ) model does not accurately describe the recent measurements of quasielastic neutrino and antineutrino scattering  @xcite .",
    "mechanisms such as nuclear correlations , final - state interactions and meson - exchange currents ( mec ) may have an impact on the inclusive neutrino charged current ( cc ) cross section .",
    "in particular , explicit calculations support the theoretical evidence  @xcite for a significant contribution from multi - nucleon knock - out to the cc cross sections @xmath0 and @xmath1 around and above the quasielastic ( qe ) peak region , defined by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the energy transfer and @xmath4 is the 3-momentum transfer .",
    "recent _ ab initio _",
    "calculations  @xcite of sum rules of weak neutral - current response functions of @xmath5c have also stressed the importance of mec in neutrino quasielastic scattering .",
    "the size of mec effects is larger than that found in inclusive cc neutrino scattering from the deuteron  @xcite .",
    "the three existing microscopic models that have provided predictions of multi - nucleon knockout effects in quasielastic neutrino and antineutrino cross sections from @xmath5c for the experimental kinematical settings are those by martini  @xcite , nieves  @xcite , and the super - scaling analysis ( susa ) model of  @xcite .    these three models are based on the fermi gas but each one contains different ingredients and approximations to face the problem .",
    "the martini model is based on the non - relativistic model of @xcite although attempts to improve it using relativistic kinematics have been made .",
    "the model includes mec and pionic correlation diagrams modified to account for the effective nuclear interaction .",
    "the interference between direct and exchange diagrams is neglected , in order to reduce the 7d integral over the phase space to a 2d integration .",
    "the nieves model is similar to martini s , but most of it is fully relativistic . in this model",
    "the momentum of the initial nucleon in the generic @xmath6 vertex is fixed to an average value . under this approximation",
    "the lindhard function can be factorized inside the integral , leaving only a 4d integration over the momentum of one of the exchanged pions .",
    "the direct - exchange interference is neglected as well .",
    "the susa model includes all the interference terms at the cost of performing a 7d integration , without any approximation , but the axial part of the mec is not yet included .",
    "it is obvious that these three models should differ numerically because they are different . but",
    "a quantitative evaluation of their differences has not been done .",
    "furthermore , the accuracy of the approximations used in these models only can be determined by comparison with an exact calculation for some kinematics .",
    "alternatively , phenomenological approaches have been proposed where 2p-2h effects , estimated by a pure two - nucleon phase - space model , are fitted to the experimental cross section  @xcite , while the nucleon ejection model of  @xcite provides a phase - space based algorithm to generate 2p-2h states in a monte carlo implementation .",
    "the present paper is a first step towards an extension of the relativistic 2p-2h model of  @xcite to the weak sector .",
    "we undertake this project with the final goal of including a consistent set of weak mec in the susa approach to cc neutrino reactions  @xcite .",
    "the model of  @xcite fully described the contribution of 2p-2h states to the transverse response function in electron scattering .",
    "based on the rfg , the model included all 2p-2h diagrams containing two pionic lines ( except for nucleon correlations that were included in @xcite ) , taking into account the quantum interferences between direct and exchange two - body matrix elements .",
    "previous calculations of two - particle emission with mec in @xmath7 involved non - relativistic models  @xcite .",
    "the first attempts for a relativistic description were made by dekker  @xcite , followed by the model of de pace _ et al . _",
    "the extension of this model to the weak sector requires the inclusion of the axial terms of mec .",
    "quasielastic neutrino scattering requires one to perform an integral over the neutrino flux .",
    "this would considerably increase the computing - time of the nuclear response function of  @xcite involving 7d integrals of thousands of terms , although improvements were made in @xcite to perform the spin traces numerically .",
    "thus in this work we address the problem from a different perspective , focusing first on a careful study of the 7d integral over the 2p-2h phase space as a function of the momentum and energy transfers .",
    "our goal is to provide a comprehensive description of the angular distribution , showing that there is a divergence in the integrand for some kinematics , and identifying mathematically the allowed integration intervals . at the same time",
    "we derive a procedure to integrate the angular distribution around the divergence analytically .",
    "this procedure allows us to reduce the cpu time considerably .",
    "this program is followed first in a pure phase - space domain , without yet including the two - body current .",
    "we also sketch the future perspectives opened by this general formalism applied to the calculation of 2p-2h contributions to electroweak responses . in a forthcoming paper , we will provide a full model of weak mec to compute the complete set of cc neutrino scattering response functions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii we define the relativistic 2p-2h response and phase space functions . in sect .",
    "iii we review the non - relativistic description of the 2p-2h integrals , semi - analytical expressions that will be used as a check of the relativistic calculations , and some interesting properties of the phase - space integral , such as scaling and asymptotic expansion . in sect .",
    "iv we address the relativistic phase - space function and asymptotic expansion , and show that some numerical problems arise from a straightforward calculation for high @xmath4 . in sect .",
    "v we describe the 2p-2h angular distribution in the _",
    "`` frozen nucleon '' _ approximation and show that this distribution has a divergence for some angles .",
    "the divergence is related to the two solutions of the energy conservation for a fixed emission angle .",
    "we give kinematical and geometrical explanations of these two solutions . in sect .",
    "vi we make a theoretical analysis of the angular distribution and find analytically the boundaries of the angular intervals .",
    "we get a formula , eq .",
    "( [ singularity ] ) , for the integral around the divergent angles . in sect .",
    "vii we present results for the phase - space function with the new integration method . in sect .",
    "viii we discuss how this formalism can be applied to the 2p-2h response functions of electron and neutrino scattering . finally in sect .",
    "ix we present our conclusions .",
    "when considering a lepton that scatters off a nucleus transferring four - momentum @xmath8 , with @xmath3 the energy transfer and @xmath9 the momentum transfer , one is involved with the hadronic tensor @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the electroweak nuclear current operator .    in this paper",
    "we take the initial nuclear state as the rfg model ground state , @xmath12 , with all states with momenta below the fermi momentum @xmath13 occupied .",
    "the sum over final states can be decomposed as the sum of one - particle one - hole ( 1p-1h ) plus two - particle two - hole ( 2p-2h ) excitations plus additional channels .",
    "@xmath14    in the impulse approximation the 1p-1h channel gives the well - known response functions of the rfg .",
    "notice that mec also contribute to these 1p-1h responses ; however , here we focus on the 2p-2h channel where the final states are of the type @xmath15 where @xmath16 are momenta of relativistic final nucleons above the fermi sea , @xmath17 , with four - momenta @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the four - momenta of the hole states with @xmath20 . the spin indices are @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and the isospin is @xmath23 .",
    "in this paper we study the 2p-2h channel in a fully relativistic framework .",
    "the corresponding hadronic tensor is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the nucleon mass , @xmath26 is the volume of the system and we have defined the product of step functions @xmath27 the function @xmath28 is the hadronic tensor for the elementary transition of a nucleon pair with the given initial and final momenta , summed up over spin and isospin , given schematically as @xmath29 which we write in terms of the anti - symmetrized two - body current matrix element @xmath30 , to be specified .",
    "the factor @xmath31 accounts for the antisymmetry of the 2p-2h wave function .",
    "finally , note that the 2p-2h response is proportional to @xmath26 which is related to the number of protons or neutrons @xmath32 by @xmath33 . in this work",
    "we only consider nuclear targets with pure isospin zero .    in the case of electrons",
    "the cross section can be written as a linear combination of the longitudinal and transverse response functions defined by @xmath34 whereas additional response functions arise for neutrino scattering , due to the presence of the axial current .",
    "the generic results coming from the phase - space obtained here are applicable to all of the response functions .    integrating over @xmath35 using the momentum delta function , eq .",
    "( [ hadronic ] ) becomes a 9d integral @xmath36 where @xmath37 . after choosing the @xmath38 direction along the @xmath39-axis ,",
    "there is a global rotation symmetry over one of the azimuthal angles .",
    "we choose @xmath40 and multiply by a factor @xmath41 .",
    "furthermore , the energy delta function enables analytical integration over @xmath42 , and so the integral is reduced to 7 dimensions . in general",
    "the calculation has to be done numerically . under some approximations",
    "@xcite the number of dimensions can be further reduced , but this can not be done in the fully relativistic calculation .    in this paper",
    "we study different methods to evaluate the above integral numerically and compare the relativistic and the non - relativistic cases . in the non - relativistic case",
    "we reduce the hadronic tensor to a 2d integral .",
    "this can be done when the function @xmath43 only depends on the differences @xmath44 , @xmath45 .    as we want to concentrate on the numerical procedure without further complications derived from the momentum dependence of the currents , in this paper we start by setting the elementary function to a constant @xmath46 .",
    "hence , we focus on the genuine kinematical effects coming from the two - particle - two - hole phase - space alone .",
    "in particular , the kinematical relativistic effects arising from the energy - momentum relation are contained in the energy conservation delta function that determines the analytical behavior of the hadronic tensor , where the energy - momentum relation is @xmath47 , and in the lorentz contraction coefficients @xmath48 .",
    "obviously the results obtained here for constant @xmath43 will be modified when including the two - body physical current .",
    "but as the final result is model - dependent , it is not possible to disentangle whether the differences found are due to the current model employed or to the approximations ( relativistic or not ) used to perform the numerical evaluation of the integral .",
    "in fact all of the models of 2p-2h response functions should agree at the level of the 2p-2h phase - space integral @xmath49 defined as @xmath50 with @xmath37 .",
    "calculation of this function should be a good starting point to compare and congenialize different nuclear models .",
    "first we recall the semi - analytical method of  @xcite that was used later in @xcite , for instance , to compute the non - relativistic 2p-2h transverse response function in electron scattering .",
    "we shall use this method to check the numerical 7d quadrature both in the relativistic and non - relativistic cases .",
    "we start with the 12d expression for the phase - space function eq .",
    "( [ hadronic ] ) @xmath51 the procedure is first to perform the integral over energy .",
    "following  @xcite we change variables @xmath52 we also define the following non - dimensional variables @xmath53 in terms of these variables the 2p-2h phase - space function is @xmath54 where we use the van orden function defined as @xmath55 this function was computed analytically in @xcite . in this work",
    "we have checked that expression because we found a typo in one of the terms in the original reference ( that typographical error does not affect the results of the cited reference ) .",
    "we give in the appendix the correct result for future reference .",
    "integrating now over the momentum @xmath56 we get @xmath57 the integral over the azimuthal angle @xmath58 of @xmath59 gives @xmath41 . finally changing to the variables @xmath60 we obtain @xmath61 where the maximum value of @xmath62 ( or @xmath63 ) is obtained from the energy conservation and momentum step functions included implicitly in the function @xmath64 . in the appendix",
    "we derive the inequality @xmath65    the 2d integral over the variables @xmath66 has to be performed numerically .",
    "the simplicity of the fermi gas model used in this paper allows us to compute the 2p-2h hadronic tensor as a 7d dimensional integral as shown below .",
    "note that in a more sophisticated model where the nuclear distribution details are taken into account , like shell models or the spectral function - based models , some of the numerical problems linked to the particular jacobian appearing here and in the following section , can be avoided , at the price of increasing the number of integrals or sums over shell - model states , thus making the calculations harder .",
    "the local fermi gas used by nieves _",
    "et al . , _ is really an average of different fermi gases at different densities , but the basic fermi gas equations are the same as here .    the hadronic tensor for the elementary 2p-2h transition , eq .  ( [ elementary ] ) , contains the direct and exchange matrix elements of the two - body current operator .",
    "if one neglects the interference between the direct and exchange terms it is possible to express @xmath43 as a function of @xmath66 only , and one can use the formalism of the above section to reduce the calculation of the 2p-2h hadronic tensor to a 2d integral . in the general case",
    "the interference can not be neglected .",
    "it is then necessary to evaluate a 7d integral numerically .",
    "thus , in this work we also compute the phase - space function , eq .  ( [ phase ] ) , numerically .",
    "this will allow us firstly to check the numerical procedures by comparison with the semi - analytical method of the previous section , secondly to determine the number of integration points needed to obtain accurate results and thirdly to optimize the computational effort .",
    "this numerical study will be very useful when including actual nuclear currents .",
    "starting with eq .",
    "( [ phase ] ) , we compute the integrand for @xmath40 ( the azimuthal angle of @xmath67 ) , and multiply by @xmath41",
    ". then we use the @xmath68 of energies to integrate over the variable @xmath42 , for fixed momenta @xmath69 and emission angle @xmath70 . to do",
    "so we first define the total momentum of the two particles that is fixed by momentum conservation @xmath71 we then change from variable @xmath42 to variable @xmath72 : @xmath73 by differentiation with respect to @xmath42 , we obtain @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the unit vector in the direction of the first particle .",
    "integrating now over @xmath72 , energy conservation is obtained as @xmath76 substituting eq .",
    "( [ eprima ] ) a second degree equation is obtained for @xmath42 @xmath77",
    "so we see that there can be two values of the nucleon momentum compatible with energy conservation , for fixed emission angle .",

    "it is of interest to quote the limit @xmath82 , because it can also be used for testing the numerical integration .",
    "the most useful case applies for @xmath83 , when one can neglect all momenta compared with the energy transfer @xmath3 , because the phase - space integral can be performed analytically . note that for the scattering reactions of interest this limit is not physical ( because @xmath84 , namely spacelike , for real particles ) .",
    "it is only a mathematical property of the function @xmath85 , that is well defined for all the @xmath3 values , not only the physical ones .",
    "we start writing the momentum of the first particle , eq .",
    "( [ momentum ] ) , as @xmath86 with the discriminant @xmath87 the limit @xmath88 can be obtained by noticing that @xmath89 and @xmath90 do not depend on @xmath3 , but only on the momenta @xmath91 , and that @xmath92 .",
    "then @xmath93 and the positive solution for the momentum is @xmath94 that is , each nucleon exits the nucleus taking half of the available energy .",
    "on the other hand , using ( [ momentum ] ) , we note that the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ integral7d ] ) can be written as @xmath95 then @xmath96    thus , for high energy , the non - relativistic phase - space function increases as @xmath97 .",

    "we compare the two computational methods : the semi - analytical of eq .",
    "( [ fasico2d ] ) and the numerical 7d integration of eq .",
    "( [ integral7d ] ) .",
    "the semi - analytical result is essentially exact , because we can choose a very small integration step for the 2d integral ( using steps of 0.02 or 0.01 the results do not change in the scale of the figure ) .",
    "however the 7d integral is computationally time - consuming and the integration step can not be very small . here",
    "we compute the integral with a `` straightforward '' method , as an average over a grid with @xmath101 total integration points , uniformly distributed .",
    "for large @xmath101 the straightforward integration should give results similar to the montecarlo methods used in previous calculations  @xcite .",
    "the number of points chosen for this calculation was 25 for the variable @xmath70 ( although it can safely be reduced to 16 ) and 16 for each one of the remaining dimensions . in total",
    "the number of points is @xmath102 .",
    "this is well above the maximum number @xmath103@xmath104 , typical of previous calculations  @xcite performed using monte carlo techniques .",
    "using 10 integration points in each dimension gives very similar results , except for some @xmath3 regions where the numerical error is manifested in an apparently slightly less smooth behavior .",
    "increasing the number of points would improve the results ; however , this is not practical because the inclusion of the two - body current would make the calculation too slow .",
    "the semi - analytical and numerical results are quite similar , the difference between them being of a few percent .",
    "for comparison we also show the asymptotic limit @xmath88 , computed using the analytical expression in eq .",
    "( [ asymptotic ] ) , which is proportional to @xmath97 .",

    "this is not a trivial task and details are provided in the appendix .",
    "the appearance of spurious solutions is a difference between the relativistic and non - relativistic methods .",
    "a second one will be discussed below in relation to a divergence of the integrand .",

    ", we find pairs of configurations with opposite total momentum @xmath304 that contribute above or below the average in approximately equal footing , so they do not change the mean value very much .    in the first example , fig .",
    "[ fig28 ] , we show the contribution of two pairs of nucleons with the same momentum @xmath305 mev / c , and both parallel , pointing upwards ( @xmath306 ) and downwards ( @xmath215 ) with respect to the @xmath39-axis , that is , the direction of @xmath9 . the contribution of the @xmath294 configuration is smaller than average , while the @xmath295 is larger .",
    "this is so because in the @xmath294 case , the total momentum @xmath90 in the final state is large . by momentum conservation",
    ", the momenta @xmath42 and @xmath307 must also be large .",
    "therefore these states need a large excitation energy , and they start to contribute for high @xmath3 transfer . in the dd configuration",
    "the total momentum @xmath90 is small , so the final momenta @xmath42 and @xmath307 can also be small , will small excitation energy .",
    "therefore they start to contribute at very low @xmath3 .    in the example of fig .",
    "[ fig29 ] two anti - parallel configurations are shown . in the @xmath296 case",
    "one nucleon is moving upwards and the other downwards the @xmath39-axis with total momentum zero of the pair .",
    "this situation is similar to that of a pair of highly correlated nucleons with large relative momentum  @xcite .",
    "since the total momentum is zero , the final 2p-2h state has total momentum @xmath9 , exactly the same that it would have in the frozen nucleon approximation .",
    "therefore the contribution of this configuration is similar to the average .",
    "the same conclusions can be drawn in the case of the configuration @xmath308 , with one nucleon moving along the @xmath62-axis ( transverse direction ) and the other along @xmath291 with opposite momentum .",
    "the contribution of this pair is exactly the same as that of the @xmath296 configuration in the total phase - space function .",
    "finally we show in fig .",
    "[ fig30 ] two intermediate cases that are neither parallel nor anti - parallel configurations .",
    "they consist in two pairs of transverse nucleons moving along mutually perpendicular directions . in the first case we consider a @xmath309-nucleon and a second @xmath310-nucleon moving in the @xmath292-axis out of the scattering plane .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath298 pair is large , while the one of the opposite case , @xmath311 is small . on the average",
    "they are close to the total result .",
    "the next step in our project of an exact evaluation of the relativistic 2p-2h electroweak response functions in the fermi gas model initiated with the approach in the present paper would be to apply it to a more realistic situation , _",
    "i.e. _ , electron and neutrino scattering .",
    "the 2p-2h states can be excited by two - body mec operators , involving exchange of an intermediate meson between two nucleons .",
    "a complete calculation , including all of the mec diagrams with one pion exchange , is out of the scope of the present paper , and will be reported in a forthcoming publication .",
    "however in this section we discuss the perspectives opened by the formalism presented here .",
    "one question can arise on why the integration problem related to the divergence in the angular distribution , that is the central issue in this work does not appear in other approaches .",
    "the models developed by martini  @xcite and nieves  @xcite neglect the direct - exchange interference terms in the hadronic tensor . in this approximation in the non - relativistic case , the change of variables introduced in eqs .",
    "( [ variables1],[variables2 ] ) reduces the integration to 2d , the integration variables in this case are proportional to the magnitude of the transferred momenta to the two nucleons . in the relativistic model of @xcite an additional approximation",
    "is made for the total @xmath312 interaction vertex , where the dependence on the initial nucleon momentum is neglected , by fixing it to an average value over the fermi sea .",
    "this trick allows one to factorize the two lindhard functions linked to the two nucleon loops in the many - body diagrams .",
    "thus two approximations are required in this case to reduce the calculation to a 4d integral over the four - momentum of one of the exchanged pions . the exact calculation including all the terms in the hadronic tensor ( direct , exchange and interference ) requires the complete 7d integral .",
    "obviously a change of variables can be made to elliminate the divergence .",
    "one possibility is to make the change @xmath313 , where @xmath314 is the function defined in eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to the change of variables made in sect .",
    "vib to integrate analitically around the divergence .",
    "the standard way to handle this problem in the monte carlo generators @xcite is to compute the 2p phase - space angular distribution in the center of mass ( cm ) system of the final nucleons , because it is angular independent , although pauli blocking can forbid some angular regions .",
    "a transformation to the lab system would give exactly the same distribution as considered in this paper .",
    "linked to this , a further possibility that we are presently investigating would be to integrate over the cm emission angle instead of the lab one considered in this work .",
    "this procedure would have the advantage of being free of the divergence coming from the jacobian , but has the drawback of requiring to perform a boost back to the lab system for each pair of holes ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "one should perform a full calculation with both approaches to see the advantages of each one in terms of cpu time .",
    "one of the main problems associated with a complete , exact calculation of the 2p-2h response functions is the computational time required when the full current is included .",
    "one of the outcomes of this work is the possibility opened by considering what we called the frozen nucleon approximation to compute the integral over the two holes .",
    "the validity of this approximation must be verified in the complete calculation .",
    "if the approximation is found to be accurate enough , then the calculation of the 2p-2h cross section could be done without much difficulty and could be easily implemented in monte - carlo generators .",
    "the verification of this approximation is one of the goals of our future work .",
    "preliminary results obtained with the seagull diagrams show that the approximation is valid for this set of diagrams .",
    "the mc generators must not perform the integration over the outgoing final state but instead must keep these momenta explicitly because one is interested in generating a full final state to be propagated .",
    "the integration performed here is only needed for the inclusive 2p-2h cross section , that can not be separated from the measured qe cross section if the final nucleons are not detected . with our model",
    "there is the possibility to generate angular distributions of nucleon 2p-2h states produced by mec , fully compatible with the inclusive 2p-2h cross sections",
    ". they could be useful for the mc generators .",
    "we have performed a detailed study of the two - particle two - hole phase - space function , which is proportional to the nuclear two - particle emission response function for constant current matrix elements . in order to obtain physically meaningful results",
    "one should include a model for the two - body currents inside the integral .",
    "however , the knowledge gained here by disregarding the operator and focusing on the purely kinematical properties has been of great help in optimizing the computation of the 7d integral appearing in the 2p-2h response functions of electron and neutrino scattering .",
    "the frozen nucleon approximation , that is , neglecting the momenta of the initial nucleons for high momentum transfer , has allowed us to focus on the angular distribution function .",
    "we have found that this function has divergences for some angles .",
    "our main goal has been to find the allowed angular regions and to integrate analytically around the divergent points .",
    "the cpu time of the 7d integral has been reduced significantly .",
    "the relativistic results converge to the non - relativistic ones for low energy transfer .",
