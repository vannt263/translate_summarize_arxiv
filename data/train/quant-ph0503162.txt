    "present day efforts in making quantum computing a reality are centered mainly on harnessing immense parallelism ( e.g. , entangled states ) inherent in quantum mechanics . in terms of information",
    "content such a parallelism means that information is spread over the whole space .",
    "the implication is that information density is not delta - function - like ( as in a classical case ) but is represented by a broader function . in a sense , this can be interpreted as an information spread , in contradistinction to a classical case , where the information is centered around the well - defined path determined by the classical equations of motion .",
    "the problem of extracting the information so spread becomes central to every possible quantum computer .",
    "therefore it seems important to determine how this spread of information occurs in general .",
    "+ for the first time an idea about a `` spread '' of information in a transition from the classical to the quantum world was expressed by p.dirac more than 70 years ago @xcite .",
    "he wrote , `` the limitation in the power of observation puts a limitation on the number of data that can be assigned to a state .",
    "thus a state of * an atomic system * must be specified by fewer or * more indefinite * data than a complete set of numerical values for all the coordinates and velocities at some instant of time . ''",
    "unfortunately , he did not elaborate further on this idea .",
    "+ does all this mean that information is lost via some sort of dissipation in a transition from classical to quantum case ?",
    "in another words , is information lost in a literal sense of the word , or simply spread around , that is the respective information density undergoes a change in a transition from a classical to quantum case ?",
    "the mechanism of the latter represents what we would call the @xmath0 .",
    "as will be shown below , this @xmath0 is the correct answer .",
    "+ a tentative approach to find the answer to this problem in a general way was outlines at @xcite .",
    "there we observed that contrary to the conventional point of view ( regarding the transition from classical to quantum physics as being necessarily due to decoherence @xcite ) , our investigation of a superfluid state demonstrated coherence preservation .",
    "indeed , in our view decoherence plays essentially no role in the transition from ordinary classical physics to quantum physics .",
    "this transition can occur in a continuous fashion preserving the coherence in a classical state .",
    "+ we also argued that `` whereas the entropy of any deterministic classical system described by a principle of least action is zero , one can assign a ' ' quantum information `` to quantum mechanical degree of freedom equal to hausdorff area of the * deviation * from a classical path . ''",
    "this raises an interesting problem of realization of a quantum computer based on a continuous transition from a quantum coherent state to a classical coherent state .",
    "such an approach is contrary to the conventional treatment of quantum computing where quantum coherence is destroyed by classical measurements .",
    "the difficulty of preserving quantum coherence lies at the heart of the general difficulty of realizing such a computer .",
    "+ in what follows we demonstrate ( using a coherent state of a quantum oscillator ) how the information - preserving mechanism , characterized by a spatial spread of information density , occurs . in a sense",
    "( and only in a sense ) , this mechanism is analogous to the effect of dissipation on the velocity profile of a viscous fluid , illustrated , for example , by stokes s first problem about a suddenly accelerated plane wall immersed in a viscous fluid @xcite .",
    "we write `` in a sense '' , since in contradistinction to fluid mechanics ( where the system dissipates energy ) , here no loss of information occurs .",
    "+ such an analogy allows us to show how in a @xmath1 scheme of things ( not restricted to some special cases as in @xcite ) the addition of the specific `` dissipative '' term ( similar to the dissipative term in fluid mechanics ) to the classical equations of motion will lead in a natural way to the wave equations , ranging from the schr@xmath2dinger to klein - gordon , to dirac equations.- dimensional case a certain transformation @xcite reduces the schr@xmath2dinger equation to a pair of differential equation , one of which is the navier - stokes vorticity equation ] + if we consider the shannon information for the coherent state of a quantum oscillator then we will be able to explicitly illustrate how the information density associated with this oscillator continuously changes from a function spread over the whole spatial domain in quantum case to the delta - function centered on the domain occupied by the values of the spatial coordinate ( that is @xmath3 ) allowed by classical mechanics . in particular",
    ", this proves ( in full agreement with the above arguments ) that in fact the @xmath4 information is not lost , but rather a change of its space density occurs .",
    "let us consider the shannon information @xmath5 @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the probability of an event @xmath8 .",
    "in what follows we replace @xmath9 by the natural logarithm which is not going to change the meaning of the information , but will simply introduce a non - essential numerical factor . for our purposes",
    "we define the probability in ( [ s ] ) with the help of the probability density function @xmath10 , as it is used in quantum mechanics .",
    "+ in this context the probability @xmath7 ( defining a probability of finding a particle in the space interval @xmath11 ) can be written as follows @xmath12 therefore @xmath13 for a coherent state of a quantum oscillator ( [ s2 ] ) yields : @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 is particle s mass , @xmath17 is the classical amplitude , @xmath18 is the classical frequency and @xmath19 is the dimensionless coordinate .",
    "parameter @xmath20 has a clear physical meaning . since @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 is the respective debroglie wavelength),@xmath23 indicates whether particle dynamics is a classical ( @xmath24 ) or a quantum one ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "+ integrating ( [ s3 ] ) , we obtain @xmath26ln\\{[\\phi(\\alpha y_{i+1})-\\phi(\\alpha y_i)]\\}\\ ] ] here @xmath27 and @xmath28 we consider a situation where @xmath29    inserting this in ( [ s4 ] ) we arrive at the following @xmath30\\ ] ] where we use @xmath31 therefore ( [ s ] ) becomes @xmath32 in the limit @xmath33 relation ( [ s6 ] ) yields the following integral @xmath34 therefore the integral function @xmath35 represents the @xmath36 , that is the information ( per unit of dimensionless length ) about finding the particle at a certain location @xmath37 . the graph of this function for various values of @xmath38 is shown in fig.@xmath39 .    ) as a function of @xmath40 for different values of @xmath41,width=226,height=226 ]     + in the limit of @xmath42 the space information density tends to the delta - function .",
    "this indicates the onset of a purely classical regime , such that outside the region @xmath3 ( occupied by the displacement of the classical oscillator ) the information density is 0 .",
    "thus all the information is `` concentrated '' in the region @xmath43 .",
    "+    ) as a function of @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath46,width=226,height=226 ]    in the opposite limit @xmath47 the information density function is spread over the domain @xmath48 of all possible values of @xmath49 reaching outside the region occupied by the displacement of the classical oscillator .",
    "this indicates a quantum regime characterized by the information which is not `` concentrated '' on a well defined path ( of measure zero ) but is rather `` diffused '' .",
    "this , of course , does not mean that the information is lost .",
    "on the contrary , the information is preserved , being however `` spread '' over the whole space .",
    "+ it is instructive to provide the graphs of the information density as a function of the spatial and temporal coordinates .",
    "these graphs are presented in figures @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 for the ratios @xmath53 respectively .    ) as a function of @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath54,width=226,height=226 ]    once again , one can easily see that with the increase of the ratio @xmath55 , that is the approach to the classical regime , the information density tends to be concentrated along the classical path @xmath56 .",
    "+ here we must emphasize that the spatial information spread expressed in terms of @xmath57 information density refers @xmath58 to the schr@xmath2dinger representation of quantum mechanics .",
    "it describes the respective dynamics in spatial - temporal terms with the help of the quantum `` potential '' , the wave function @xmath10 . on the other hand , the equivalent second quantization representation of quantum mechanics deals only with the number states , without reference to their spatial distribution .",
    "therefore it is important to find out how the respective information density varies with changes in number states , which can be quite different from the changes of information density in the schr@xmath2dinger representation .",
    "+      let us calculate this information density .",
    "the probability to find an oscillator in the @xmath59 state is @xmath60 where the average number of states @xmath61 the shannon information is then @xmath62 where we use natural logarithm , instead the one base @xmath50 , which would introduce into the result a nonessential numerical factor . from eq.([n2 ] ) follows @xmath63 in general , the sum in ( [ n3 ] ) can not be found in a closed form .",
    "however , we can evaluate it in the quantum limit @xmath64 @xmath65 since there is no analytical solution to ( [ n3 ] ) , the numerical evaluation allows us to represent the result as a graph @xmath66 .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "one can easily see that the _ number state _ information density @xmath68 in a transition from a quantum to a classical regime , in contradistinction to the @xmath69 information density with its sharp increase around the classical trajectory .",
    "+ the apparent paradox is resolved by observing that in the number state representation the shannon information is not conserved anymore .",
    "in fact , according to ( [ n2 ] ) it increases in a transition from the quantum to the classical case , since the average number of states given by [ n11 ] ( i.e. roughly the ratio of a classical amplitude and the respective de broglie wavelength ) monotonically increases .",

    "the previous sections imply that a judicious introduction of a `` dissipative '' ( or rather quasi - dissipative ) term ( signaling a @xmath69 spread of information ) into the equations of classical mechanics can result in the respective quantum equations . to achieve this goal we use the following experimental facts :    \\1 ) quantum phenomena",
    "are characterized by the superposition principle , implying that in contradistinction to the classical mechanics with its non - linear equations , the respective quantum equations must be linear .",
    "2)there exists a smallest finite quantum of energy @xmath71 , which in the phase space corresponds to the finite elemental area @xmath72 .",
    "\\3 ) quantum phenomena exhibit both particle and wave properties .",
    "+ we begin with the second law of newton for a single particle moving from p.@xmath73 to p.@xmath74 ( see fig.@xmath75 ) .",
    "the particle can do that by taking any possible path connecting these two points .",
    "therefore for any fixed moment of time , say @xmath76 particle s momentum would depend on the spatial coordinate , that is @xmath77 .",
    "this means that now the substantial derivative @xmath78 . in a sense , instead of watching the particle evolution in time one",
    "watches the evolution of its momentum in space and time .",
    "this situation is analogous to the euler s description of motion of a fluid ( an alternative to the lagrange description ) . the other way to look at",
    "that is to consider a `` flow '' of an `` elemental '' path and describe its `` motion '' in terms of its coordinates and velocity .    .",
    "it is clearly seen that particle s velocity ( momentum ) is a function of both coordinate @xmath37 and time @xmath45,width=226,height=226 ]    taking this into account we write the second law as follows ( e.g.,@xcite ) @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the momentum flux density tensor , and we adopt the convention of summation over the repeated indices .    in a purely classical case @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the potential , representing an absence of `` friction '' between different possible paths . on the other hand ,",
    "at the micro - level we postulate a `` viscous '' transfer of momentum from a path with a greater momentum to paths with a smaller momentum , similar to a transfer of energy from larger to smaller scales in a turbulent motion .",
    "therefore we add to the `` ideal '' momentum flux @xmath83 in ( [ 30 ] ) a term analogous to the one used in classical mechanics of fluids .",
    "this yields the following expression for @xmath80(e.g.,@xcite ) @xmath84 where `` viscosities '' @xmath85 will be determined in what follows .",
    "+ inserting ( [ 31 ] ) in ( [ 30 ] ) we obtain in vector notations : @xmath86    application of @xmath87 to both sides of ( [ 32 ] ) results in the following : @xmath88 -\\nu_1^q\\nabla\\times[\\nabla\\times(\\nabla\\times\\vec{p})]=0\\ ] ] equation ( [ 33 ] ) is identically satisfied if @xmath89 , or equivalently @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a new `` effective action '' .",
    "+ it must be said , that this `` effective action '' serves only as an interim auxiliary function without a clear physical meaning , which allows us to make a transition to the quantum case .",
    "importantly enough , in contradistinction to the conventional hydrodynamical treatment of viscous fluid , the present case is irrotational . in conventional hydrodynamics of incompressible viscous fluids",
    "( with @xmath92 ) motion with @xmath93 represents a potential motion @xmath94 .",
    "however at the atomic scales @xmath95 , because of the absence of continuity equation analogous to the one in incompressible fluid , that is now @xmath96 + substituting([34 ] ) in ( [ 32 ] ) and using the vector identities @xmath97\\ ] ] @xmath98    we obtain the following equation @xmath99 where @xmath100 equation ( [ 35 ] ) is identically satisfied if @xmath101 we have arrived at what can be called a modified hamilton - jacobi equation with `` dissipation '' . as we have already indicated , it does not play any role at the macro - scales of classical mechanics due to the smallness of the dissipative term as compared to the rest of the terms .",
    "as will be shown later , this smallness is directly related to the ratio of the debroglie wavelength and the characteristic length on a classical scale .",
    "+ since the obtained equation is non - linear , it can not be used to describe quantum phenomena , since this contradicts the experimental facts about superposition of quantum states .",
    "in addition , ( [ 35a ] ) does not have a wave solution , which again contradicts the experimental facts about quantum phenomena .",
    "therefore we have ( if possible ) to identically transform ( [ 35a ] ) into an equation which would be    * \\a ) linear and * \\b ) would allow wave solutions .",
    "requirement @xmath102 can be achieved ( at least for a time dependence ) , if it would be possible to transform ( [ 35a ] ) into a homogeneous ( but still nonlinear ) partial differential equation of order @xmath50 . to test this proposition",
    "we introduce a new function , say @xmath103 , such that @xmath104 inserting ( [ s10 ] ) in ( [ 35a ] ) we obtain : @xmath105\\ ] ] amazingly enough , this equation becomes a homogenous nonlinear partial differential equation of order @xmath50 with respect to the new function @xmath106 , if and only if the functional dependence ( [ s10 ] ) is as follows : @xmath107 solving ( [ s12 ] ) we obtain : @xmath108 where constant @xmath73 a will be determined later with the help of the requirements formulated at the beginning of this section .",
    "since constant @xmath109 does not enter into the resulting equation with respect to function @xmath106 , we set it equal to 0 without any loss of generality .",
    "therefore ( [ s13 ] ) yields @xmath110 this relation is exactly what schr@xmath2dinger originally introduced `` by hand '' in his first paper in the historical series of @xmath75 papers on the wave equation @xcite .",

    "since the `` viscosity '' @xmath114 was introduced in such a way that its exact value was undetermined , we can use this fact and eliminate the nonlinear term by the appropriate choice of @xmath114 .",
    "this procedure yields : @xmath115 as a result , equation ( [ s14 ] ) becomes @xmath116 + we still need to find the value of constant @xmath73 .",
    "this can be done by using the experimental fact about a smallest amount of energy available at the microscale ( condition @xmath50 of this section ) . to this end",

    "as we have pointed earlier , the dissipative term , heuristically introduced into the hamilton - jacobi equation , does not play any role at the classical scales .",
    "one can consider it as small perturbations which become significant only at the micro - scales .",
    "this proposition is confirmed by the following reasoning .",
    "smallness of the dissipative term as compared with the rest of the terms in either hamilton - jacobi equation ( [ 35a ] ) or the second law of newton [ written as ( [ 32 ] ) ] is determined by its comparison on a dimensional basis with the dynamic term @xmath139 .",

    "+ when we follow the procedure outlined above , we must keep in mind , that now instead of the definition of momentum @xmath149 we have to use the generalized momentum @xmath150 : @xmath151 where the `` viscosity '' @xmath114 to be determined . using substitution",
    "( [ s26 ] ) in ( [ 38 ] ) and performing some elementary vector operations we arrive at the following    @xmath152    by requiring this equation to be linear we get the following value of constant @xmath153 @xmath154 which is exactly the same ( eq.[s26a ] ) as in the previous case of the schr@xmath2dinger equation for an electrically neutral particle . inserting this value back in ( [ 39 ] )",

    ", dissipation introduces irreversibility into a system , and , quoting m.planck @xcite , `` irreversible processes are not represented by the principle of least action '' .",
    "therefore it seems paradoxical that the introduction of dissipation into a classical mechanical system ( in a form analogous to the one encountered in classical fluid mechanics ) would allow us to use the principle of least action .",

    "+ in terms of the vector potential @xmath147 this energy is @xmath207    experiments demonstrated that the magnetic moment @xmath208 of an electron is proportional to its spin @xmath209 : @xmath210 it is remarkable that once again ( as in the above cases ) the coefficient of proportionality in ( [ 44 ] ) has the dimension of kinematic viscosity !",
    "its magnitude is twice the magnitude of the @xmath211 .",
    "+ if we substitute ( [ 44 ] ) , in ( [ 43 ] ) we obtain @xmath212 this expression has a structure of the dissipative term introduced earlier in the hamilton - jacobi equation ( [ 38 ] )",
    ". therefore we rewrite this equation with the additional `` dissipative '' term ( [ 45 ] ) @xmath213\\ ] ] + we substitute ( [ s26 ] ) in ( [ 46 ] ) , use the vector identity @xmath214 and obtain @xmath215 since the required equation must be linear ( which uniquely defines @xmath153 again as @xmath216 ) , and function @xmath106 now depends on the @xmath217-component of the spin @xmath209 ( that is , it becomes a @xmath218 vector - column function ) we have to replace vector @xmath209 by the respective ( @xmath219 ) matrices @xmath220 . as a result , we arrive at the pauli equation : @xmath221 + since the method of information spread introduced into the classical hamilton - jacobi equations via the `` effective viscosity '' @xmath153 has turned out to be fruitful so far , we apply it to a simple case of a particle in the gravitational field .",
    "the hamilton - jacobi equation in this case is @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the metric tensor , @xmath224 , the @xmath225 denotes covariant differentiation , and we set @xmath118 .",
    "+ now we add to the right - hand side of ( [ 49 ] ) the dissipative term in the form used in the above calculations , that is @xmath226 .",
    "however , this time , instead of the conventional derivatives , we use the covariant derivatives and replace the constant scalar @xmath153 by a tensor function @xmath227 . as a result , equation ( [ 49 ] ) becomes : @xmath228 + by using substitution ( [ s26 ] ) in ( [ 50 ] ) and performing some standard calculations we obtain the following @xmath229 where @xmath230 is the ricci tensor .",
    "we require this equation to be linear , which uniquely determines the value of the tensor @xmath227 : @xmath231 since @xmath232 equation ( [ 51 ] ) yields @xmath233 where @xmath234 . + as a particular example we consider the centrally symmetric gravitational field with the schwarzchild metric : @xmath235equation ( [ 53 ] ) is then @xmath236",
    "physical phenomena can only be described as either particle - like or wave - like phenomena .",
    "consequently , the critical question arises : does the complex - valued wave function @xmath106 represent reality , or is it only an intricate device to deal with something we do nt have a complete knowledge of ? + bohm @xcite proposed to remove such indeterminacy and thus to answer the above question by introducing hidden variables into the existing shr@xmath2dinger equation .",
    "we treat this problem * absolutely differently * , first    * by starting from the classical hamilton - jacobi equation in physics . in his letter to e.schrdinger",
    "@xcite he wrote,``i have always been convinced that its ( @xmath237 ) significance in physics was still far from exhausted''](without any presumed @xmath238 knowledge of the shrdinger equation ) and arriving at the shrdinger equation , and secondly * without using any hidden variables , since they are not necessary in such an approach .",
    "instead , and this is the major idea of our approach , we demonstrate that the above indeterminacy is due to a spread of information , where @xmath239 is the number of the degrees of freedom , is roughly speaking the number of quantum states , whose average negative logarithm represents the system s entropy ] over the whole space , with a simultaneous preservation of information , in contradistinction to the classical case where the same information is centered on the classical path occupied by a classical particle .",
    "+ such an @xmath240 is described by an information density function which is different from a delta - like function observed in the classical case . in a sense , this resembles a dissipation of temperature in a solid body , but only in a sense , since the total quantity of heat remains unchanged .",
    "no wonder that the resulting shrdinger equation has a form of the diffusion equation , albeit with the imaginary `` time '' ( which reflects the intrinsic presence of wave features in this phenomenon ) .",
    "more to the point , the above process resembles the transfer of energy from larger to smaller scales in turbulence ( e.g. , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . + as a result , the wave - like quantum mechanics turns out to follow from the particle - like classical mechanics due to the explicit introduction in the latter of a dissipative mechanism responsible for the spread of information .",
    "consequently , the initial precise information about the classical trajectory of a particle is `` spread '' ( but not lost ) over the whole space , which for a simple case of a spinless particle @xcite , @xcite results in a transformation of a classical trajectory into a fractal path with hausdorff dimension of @xmath50 .",
    "+ the idea of quantum mechanics representing a spatial spread of information , implemented ( in a general way ) in this paper , has not only made it possible to elementary derive the basic quantum - mechanical equations from the continuum equations of classical mechanics , but also seems to be applicable to more complex and intriguing problems , as for example , a relativistic particle in the gravitational field .",
