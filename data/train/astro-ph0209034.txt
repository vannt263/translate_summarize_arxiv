    "in order to understand the chemical and thermodynamical state of the interstellar medium ( ism ) of primeval galaxies , dust formation needs to be considered . even in metal",
    "poor galaxies , dust grains can drastically accelerate the formation rate of molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath1 ) , expected to be the most abundant molecule in the ism ( hirashita , hunt , & ferrara 2002a ) .",
    "hydrogen molecules emit vibrational - rotational lines , thus cooling the gas .",
    "this process is particularly important to understand the formation of stars in metal - poor primeval galaxies ( e.g. , matsuda , sato , & takeda 1969 ; omukai & nishi 1998 ; nishi & susa 1999 ; bromm , coppi , & larson 2002 ; abel , bryan , & norman 2002 ; nakamura & umemura 2002 ; kamaya & silk 2002 ; ripamonti et al .",

    "petitjean , srianand , & ledoux 2000 ) .",
    "the existence of dust in young galaxies is naturally expected because type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) are shown to produce dust grains ( e.g. , dwek et al .  1983 ; moseley et al .  1989 ; kozasa , hasegawa , & nomoto 1991 ; todini & ferrara 2001 ) . since the lifetime of sn ii progenitors ( massive stars ) is short , sne ii are the dominant production source for of dust grains in young ( @xmath14 gyr ) star - forming galaxies .",
    "the winds of evolved low - mass stars contribute to dust formation considerably in nearby galaxies ( gehrz 1989 ) , but the cosmic time is not long enough for such stars to evolve at high redshift ( @xmath10 ) , when all galaxies should have ages smaller than @xmath15 gyr .",
    "however , dust is also destroyed by sn shocks ( mckee 1989 ; jones , tielens , & hollenbach 1996 ) .",
    "the detailed modelling of dust evolution in galaxies therefore requires an accurate treatment of both types of processes ( for recent modeling , see e.g. , edmunds 2001 ; hirashita , tajiri , & kamaya 2002b ) .",
    "here we model the evolution of dust content in primeval galaxies .",
    "we adopt the results of todini & ferrara ( 2001 ) for the dust formation rate in sne ii .",
    "although further discussion on their application of nucleation theory is necessary ( e.g. , frenklach & feigelson 1997 ) , their results have been successfully applied to the interpretation not only of the properties of sn 1987a but also of the fir properties of the young dwarf galaxy sbs 0335@xmath16052 ( hirashita et al .",
    "2002a ) .",
    "one of the most direct observational constraints for the evolution of dust content in galaxies comes from the far - infrared ( fir ) properties of galaxies .",
    "dust grains absorb stellar light and reemit it in fir .",
    "recent observations by the submillimetre common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) and the _ infrared space observatory _ ( _ iso _ ) have made it possible to study galaxy evolution in the fir band up to @xmath17 ( smail et al .",
    "the detection of the cosmic infrared  submillimetre ( sub - mm ) background by the _ cosmic background explorer _ ( _ cobe _ ) ( puget et al .  1996 ; fixsen et al .",
    "1998 ) has also provided crucial information on the star formation history of galaxies in the universe ( e.g. , dwek et al .",
    "some theoretical works have modelled the fir evolution of galaxies up to @xmath18 ( tan , silk , & balland 1999 ; pei , fall , & hauser 1999 ; takeuchi et al .",
    "2001a ; xu et al .",
    "2001 ; pearson 2001 ; totani & takeuchi 2002 ) , and the fir luminosity of galaxies per unit comoving volume seems to be much higher at @xmath19 than at @xmath20 ( see also elbaz et al .",
    "however , such a strong `` evolution '' beyond @xmath21 has been excluded ( gispert , lagache , & puget 2000 ; malkan & stecker 2001 ; takeuchi et al .",
    "2001a ) .",
    "although there is clear evidence for the existence of dust in galaxies at @xmath22 ( armus et al .",
    "1998 ; soifer et al .  1998 ) , few works focusing on the early dust formation in galaxies exist .",
    "some `` semi - analytic '' works have included the dust formation in the early galaxy evolution ( e.g. , devriendt & guiderdoni 2000 ; granato et al .",
    "2000 ) , but there has been no study treating the dust formation , the molecular formation on grain surfaces , and the star formation history in a consistent manner .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we model the three processes consistently so that we can obtain an observational strategy under a consistent scenario for the early evolution of galaxies .",
    "in order to understand which physical processes govern dust formation , observations at sub - mm wavelengths ( @xmath23 mm ) are crucial . for high - redshift objects , redshifted fir radiation , i.e. , sub - mm light , should be observed to detect the dust emission . in particular , detecting the sub - mm radiation from galaxies at @xmath10 requires more sensitive and high - resolution observations ( e.g. , takeuchi et al .",
    "a future ground - based interferometric facility , the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) , can be used to study such high - redshift galaxies .",
    "the detected amount of metals and stars can be used to constrain the galaxy evolution through a chemical evolution model ( tinsley 1980 ) .",
    "redshifted sub - mm metal emission lines can also be observed with alma .",
    "this can directly constrain the abundance of metals formed in the early epoch of galaxy evolution .",

    ", we can observe the @xmath25   ultraviolet ( uv ) light radiated from a galaxy at @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , our scenario will become testable in the near future .",
    "this means that it is worth constructing a consistent model for the high - redshift galaxy evolution .    for any observational facility ,",
    "statistical properties of galaxies should be discussed to obtain a general picture of galaxy evolution .",
    "two quantities are particularly important for statistical purposes : galaxy number counts ( the number of galaxies as a function of observed flux ) and integrated light ( the sum of the flux from all the galaxies considered ; hauser & dwek 2001 for a review ) . in this paper , therefore , we estimate the contribution of high - redshift galaxies to these two quantities .    throughout this paper",
    ", we assume a flat cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology with a cosmological constant .",
    "the values of quantities are the same as those in mo & white ( 2002 ) ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath30 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 ) .",
    "the baryon density parameter is assumed to be @xmath31 .",
    "for the power spectrum of the density fluctuation , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are adopted .",
    "we first model the physical state of gas and the content of dust and metals in a galaxy during its early evolutionary stage (   [ sec : each ] ) .",
    "there we also model the luminosities of fir , uv , and metal lines . the result of our model for fiducial galaxies are presented in   [ sec : result ] .",
    "based on these results , we next calculate the galaxy number counts and the integrated light at various wavelengths in   [ sec : nc ] .",
    "we discuss the observational implications of our results in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we aim at modelling the star formation rate during the early stage of galaxy evolution .",
    "we consider that stars form only in molecular environments , where cooling to a low temperature is possible .",
    "we solve the evolution of molecular content in a way consistent with the star formation history and the dust supply from stars .",
    "some of the past studies ( e.g. , norman & spaans 1996 ) have also considered similar processes , but we now tie star formation to the molecular content in determining the star formation rate (   [ subsec : sfr ] ) .    before @xmath34 , all the galaxies are younger than the cosmic age , 10 , and 20 are 1.2 , 0.47 , and 0.18 gyr , respectively . ] of 1.2 gyr .",
    "although dust can play an important role in forming hydrogen molecules , the model for the evolution of dust content in the early epoch of the universe has not been developed yet .",
    "since planned facilities will enable us to observe dust emission from @xmath10 , it is worth constructing a theoretical framework for the dust evolution at @xmath10 . for observational strategies",
    ", we estimate the radiative energy at various wavelengths . for @xmath35 ,",
    "the number of galaxies which survive stellar feedback is negligible ( ciardi et al .",
    "therefore , we concentrate ourselves on galaxies formed between @xmath36 and 5 .        the star formation process is affected by the physical state of the ism .",
    "in particular , cooling by molecular hydrogen plays an important role in star formation .",
    "although the law governing the galactic star formation rate is not established at all for primeval galaxies ( kennicutt s empirical law is derived from observations of nearby galaxies ; kennicutt 1998 ) , the abundance of h@xmath1 should be ultimately a key parameter as stars are only seen to form in molecular complexes ( see e.g. , wilson et al .",
    "2000 for a recent observation of a nearby galaxy ) .",
    "moreover , enhancement of molecular gas formation is shown to result in active star formation ( for recent results , see e.g. , walter et al .",
    "we define the molecular fraction of hydrogen , @xmath37 , as @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the number densities of hydrogen nuclei and hydrogen molecules , respectively",
    "( i.e. , if all the hydrogen nuclei are in the molecular form , @xmath41 ) .",
    "the importance of @xmath37 in the star formation law is modeled in   [ subsec : sfr ] .",
    "we consider a pure hydrogen gas , and neglect helium in this paper for the following two reasons .",
    "first , helium has little influence on the electron abundance ( i.e. , the formation rate of 2 in the gas phase is not affected by the presence of he ; hutchings et al .  2002 ) .",
    "second , the existence of helium does not affect the temperature of gas and thus it does not change the reaction rates concerning 2 formation kitayama et al .  (",
    "2000 ) . in order to examine the time evolution of @xmath37 ,",
    "we solve a set of reaction equations describing the 2 formation and destruction .",
    "first , we must estimate the number density of the hydrogen gas @xmath40 , because it affects both the reaction rate and the cooling rate .",
    "the objects that can form stars continuously against the heating from interstellar uv ( iuv ) radiation and stellar kinetic energy input have virial temperature typically larger than @xmath42 k ( ciardi et al .",
    "since we are interested in the star formation activity of galaxies , we only consider objects whose virial temperature is larger than such value .",
    "if the gas temperature is larger than @xmath42 k , cooling by hydrogen atomic lines is efficient",
    ". then the gas loses pressure and collapses in the gravitational field of dark matter . even in the presence of uv background radiation , objects with such a high virial temperature",
    "can collapse because of efficient cooling and 2 self - shielding ( kitayama et al .",
    "the collapse increases the 2 column density further , and as a result , external uv shielded by 2 has little effect on the temperature and dynamics of the gas after the collapse . therefore , we neglect the external uv radiation field .    since the gas cooling time is much shorter than the hubble timescale for the objects of interest in this paper ( madau , ferrara , & rees 2001 ) , we expect that a significant fraction of baryons finally collapses in the dark matter potential .",
    "if the halo is rotating , the gas will collapse in a centrifugally supported disk .",
    "the radius ( @xmath43 ) and the scale height ( @xmath44 ) of the disk are determined following ferrara , pettini , & shchekinov ( 2000 ) ( see also norman & spaans 1996 ; ciardi & loeb 2000 ) . by considering the conservation of angular momentum and assuming a typical value for the spin parameter ( @xmath45 ; barnes & efstathiou 1987 ; steinmetz & bartelmann 1995 ) , we obtain @xmath46 , and the radius of the dark halo , @xmath47 ,",
    "is estimated in terms of the mass of the dark halo , @xmath48 , and the redshift of virialisation , @xmath49 , as @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the critical density of the universe at @xmath53 and the overdensity of an object formed at @xmath49 , respectively . the spherical collapse model ( e.g. , peebles 1980 ) predicts @xmath54 .",

    "@xmath40 is estimated from @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the mass of a hydrogen atom .",
    "we have assumed that the mass of a galaxy is dominated by the dark halo and that the mass of the gas is @xmath63 .",
    "an object collapsed at @xmath49 with a mass of @xmath48 has a virial temperature , @xmath64 , defined as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the gravitational constant , @xmath67 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath24 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "the factor `` 3 '' can be different depending on the radial profile of gas .",
    "therefore , the definition of @xmath64 contains an uncertainty of the order unity . since we are considering a pure hydrogen gas , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the ionisation degree ( fraction of hydrogen nuclei in the ionized state ) which is derived from equation ( [ eq : ion_deg ] ) below .",
    "the circular velocity , @xmath70 , is defined as @xmath71 we also define the circular timescale , @xmath72 , as @xmath73    the disk thickness relative to the radius is estimated by using the formalism in ferrara et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . using @xmath64 ( eq .  [ eq : t_vir ] ) for the gas temperature ,",
    "@xmath74 is estimated to be @xmath75 .",
    "we fix this thickness for the disk throughout the time evolution of each galaxy .",
    "probably @xmath44 could decrease further as gas cools , but it is difficult to include a dynamical evolution of gas into our one - zone model .",
    "moreover , turbulent energy supplied by sne ii increases @xmath44 , an effect which is hard to quantify in the framework of this paper .",
    "the resulting gas density roughly follows the scaling relation : @xmath76 ^ 3~{\\rm cm}^{-3}$ ] .",
    "this is higher than the typical density of the local interstellar medium ( @xmath77 ) , reflecting the high - density environment of high - redshift universe .",
    "however , that density is lower than that calculated by norman & spaans ( 1996 ) because of our higher @xmath74 . even in our case , the gas cools to reach 300 k on a short ( @xmath78 ) timescale and star formation becomes possible anyway .",
    "the detailed treatment of @xmath74 does not affect any of the following conclusions except for the metal - line emission , for which we will discuss the uncertainty caused by this factor (   [ subsubsec : metal ] ) . the gas consumption into stars is also neglected .",
    "this is a valid assumption in this paper , because in our calculation star formation history is only traced until @xmath79% of the gas content is consumed .",
    "we calculate the time evolution of ionisation degree ( @xmath69 ) , molecular fraction ( @xmath80 ; equation [ eq : mol_frac ] ) and gas temperature ( @xmath81 ) of the hydrogen gas .",
    "the molecular fraction is particularly relevant here , because it determines the final cooling rate of gas when stars form ( @xmath82 k ) . in order to determine @xmath80",
    ", we also calculate @xmath81 and @xmath69 .",
    "the equations are basically the same as those of hutchings et al .",
    "( 2002 ) except for the photo - processes ( reaction of gas with photons from stars ) and the formation of h@xmath1 on dust grains .",

    "if more than two metal lines are detected , a consistency check of gas density is possible .",
    "in order to quantify the importance of dust on the first star formation activity in the universe , we have solved the time evolution of dust mass in the galaxies formed in the redshift range @xmath10 , when the age of the universe is @xmath102 gyr .",
    "we have taken into account the importance of 2 abundance for the star formation rate , and the formation of molecules on dust in a consistent manner (   [ sec : each ] ) . in particular , we have made the first attempt to tie the star formation efficiency to 2 abundance in relatively primordial environments (   [ subsec : sfr ] ) . even when this inefficient phase of star formation is included",
    ", an active phase of star formation takes place after a few @xmath72 ( much shorter than the hubble timescale ) because a significant amount of dust is accumulated to activate the 2 formation on the grain surfaces ( fig .",
    "[ fig : h2 ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the grains play an essential role in causing the first active phase of star formation . as a result",
    ", we have provided a robust support for some theoretical works that have implicitly assumed that stars are formed at high redshift as efficiently as at low redshift .",
    "radiative properties of high - redshift star - forming galaxies are also predicted .",
    "we have found that a significant amount of luminosity is radiated in the fir range .",
    "the fir luminosity becomes comparable to the uv luminosity in a few @xmath72 , when a significant amount of dust is accumulated ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fir_luminosity ] ) .",
    "this efficient reprocessing of the uv light into the fir results partly from the dense ( i.e. , large optical depth ) environment of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "observations of the fir light ( sub - mm light in the observer s restframe ) as well as those of the stellar light are thus crucial to trace the whole stellar radiative energy from high - redshift galaxies .    in the framework of our model we have also given an approximate estimate of some sub - mm metal - line luminosities .",
    "however , this can only been seen as an upper limit to the actual luminosity because considerable uncertainty is present on the gas density (   [ subsubsec : metal ] and appendix [ app : line ] ) .",
    "if future sub - mm or millimetre observations detect metal lines , a density probe of ism of the high - redshift galaxies will be possible .",
    "if more than two types of metal - lines are detected , density can be estimated more precisely .      in about ten years",
    ", it will become possible to detect sources at high redshift ( @xmath10 ) in both sub - mm and nir .",
    "the luminosity level of the galaxies at these wavelengths will put important constraints on our model .",
    "therefore , we have calculated the number counts for both wavelengths . as a result , we have found that alma ( 450 @xmath24 m , 850 @xmath24 m , and 1.3 mm bands ) and _ ngst _ ( nir bands ) can detect several times @xmath103 and @xmath12 high - redshift galaxies per square degree , respectively .",
    "these numbers can be used to test our model .",
    "we have also calculated the integrated intensity of the metal - line emission from the galaxies from @xmath34 to 7 .",
    "although a precise determination of the line intensity requires a model for the gas density ( perhaps a model for photo - dissociation region as hollenbach & mckee 1979 is also necessary ) , we can estimate a maximum intensity for the integrated metal - line intensity .",
    "the results are listed in the last two columns of table [ tab : metal ] .",
    "the contamination with the cosmic sub - mm and microwave background could represent a potential problem , but such high - redshift galaxies have a correlation scale of the order of @xmath104 ( appendix [ app : angular ] ) .",
    "therefore , a fluctuation analysis of sky brightness in ( sub-)millimetre can discriminate the metal - line signal from other contaminating sources by examining the typical correlation scale . a quantitative analysis of the fluctuations using the structure formation theory is left for future work . it may be also possible to probe the gas density of high - redshift galaxies through the factor @xmath97 in appendix [ app : line ] , if more than two kinds of metal - lines are detected .",
    "the relative intensities of two lines can be used to derive a probable value of @xmath40 .",
    "finally , we should mention how to select high - redshift galaxies efficiently .",
    "galaxy colors ( flux ratios between two bands ) are often used for the selection .",
    "we have shown that alma can detect galaxies at @xmath105 .",
    "the peak of the dust emission lies roughly between 500 @xmath24 m and 800 @xmath24 m for galaxies between @xmath34 and 7 .",
    "for example , 450 @xmath24 m vs. 1.3 mm flux ratio ( 4501300 @xmath24 m color ) gives us a useful information on the redshift , because the peak of flux lies between these bands only for the high redshift galaxies . in figure [ fig : color ] , we show the flux at 850 @xmath24 m ( @xmath106 ) and 4501300 @xmath24 m color ( @xmath107 ) predicted by the modified blackbody spectra ( eq .

    "galaxies with @xmath109 will be detected by alma . at @xmath110 , however , the number of such massive galaxies is negligible and does not contribute to number counts .",

    "the lyman limit at the wavelength of 912   in the restframe of a galaxy is redshifted to 55007300   for galaxies at @xmath347 . therefore ,",
    "optical / nir observations of galaxies by _ ngst _ ( mather & stockman 2000 ) or other sensitive facilities provides us a way to sample the high - redshift candidates independent from the alma sample . a large sample of galaxies with @xmath117- or @xmath118-band dropout should be collected by future observations .",

    "when we apply our framework to lower redshifts , therefore , it is necessary to extend our model to include the details of the merging history of galaxies . we should note that the enhancement of molecular formation is also a key to star formation activity in mergers ( e.g. , walter et al .",

    "recent studies using the subaru telescope ( ouchi et al .",
    "2002 ) have pushed observations as deep as @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , the luminosity function ( or comoving star formation rate ) derived from the `` subaru deep field '' , which is as wide as 600 arcmin@xmath123 and as deep as 26 ab magnitude around 7000 will allow us to directly compare our results at @xmath18 . the luminosity function at @xmath18 is also important to constrain the evolutionary scenario of lyman break populations found at @xmath124 . is the luminosity function of galaxies at @xmath18 explained by the same population of lyman break galaxies at @xmath124 ?",
