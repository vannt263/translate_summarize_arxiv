    "it has a radio pulsar within the boundary of the shell ( wolszczan et al .",

    "if the bullet arises from the w44 molecular cloud at @xmath63 , its kinetic energy amounts to @xmath4 .",
    "this is approximately 1.5 orders of magnitude greater than the kinetic energy shared to the small solid angle of the bullet , @xmath87 .",
    "obviously , the energy injection by an sn explosion alone can not account for the kinetic energy of the bullet .        1 .",
    "it has a compact appearance ( @xmath1 pc@xmath2 ) and an extraordinarily broad velocity width ( @xmath9 ) , giving a dynamical time of 50008000 yr .",
    "2 .   unlike previously detected broad emissions",
    ", it appears in the negative velocity side only .",
    "it bifurcates at @xmath88 , showing a `` y '' shape in the _ l - v _ plane . 4 .",
    "it has a mass of @xmath89 @xmath90 and a kinetic energy of @xmath4 .",
    "the kinetic energy can not be supplied by the w44 sn shell .",
    "a radio continuum blob and an h@xmath13 ro - vibrational line nebulosity are associated with it .",
    "these characteristics indicate that the bullet has been accelerated by a certain local event , possibly driven by a single source .",
    "if so , the kinetic energy supplied by the driving source must be greater than @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , the short dynamical time and large kinetic energy indicate that the kinetic power of the driving source must be greater than @xmath91 ( @xmath92 @xmath93 ) . here , we present two possible formation scenarios of the bullet .",
    "an additional explosive event near the expanding sn shell could account for the kinematics of the bullet ( fig .",
    "3a ) . in this case",
    ", the driving source must be located behind the expanding shell since the bullet is single - sided . for the same reason ,",
    "the kinetic energy and kinetic power necessary for the bullet formation are doubled , @xmath94  and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "the upper part of the `` y '' shape can be interpreted as the expanding shell due to the local explosion , while the lower part might be the broken tip of the shell in the low - density layer .",
    "a rotation - powered pulsar may be a candidate for the driving source .",
    "some energetic pulsars have spin - down power higher than @xmath96 ( e.g. , arumugasamy , pavlov , &  kargaltsev 2014 ) .",
    "however , no pulsar has been detected toward this position .",
    "the w44 pulsar is located at least @xmath12 pc away from the bullet .",
    "a bipolar outflow from a massive protostar is not a candidate for the driving source , because of the absence of a luminous stellar object , although some of them provide kinetic energies greater than @xmath97 ( bally &  zinnecker 2005 ) .",
    "a completely separate supernova explosion can account for the kinetic energy of the bullet .",
    "if we assume an isotropic disk ( radius@xmath98 kpc , thickness@xmath99 pc ) distribution of population i objects and that supernovae occur in spiral arms ( volume filling factor@xmath100 ) , the supernova rate of the entire galaxy ( @xmath101 yr@xmath102 ; tammann et al .",
    "@xmath103 ) provides a chance probability of another supernova in the w44 shell ( radius@xmath98 pc ) within 20 thousand years as @xmath104 . considering that massive stars are formed in clusters , this chance probablity may be further enhanced .    despite the separate supernova scenario can not be ruled out , here we consider another possibility in detail . that is an isolated black hole ( bh ) activated by the passage of a high - density molecular gas layer .",
    "such an object has already been suggested as a driving source of the tornado nebula ( sakai et al .",
    "this process is formalized as the bondi - hoyle - littleton ( bhl ) accretion ( e.g. , edgar 2004 ) . assuming the standard accretion disk model onto a bh and that all the gravitational energy is converted to the kinetic energy , the bhl accretion with a duration time @xmath105 provides @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the bh mass",
    ", @xmath108 is the mass density of the ambient interstellar medium , @xmath109 is the relative velocity , and @xmath110 is the velocity dispersion .",
    "the duration time of the accretion is calculated by @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the thickness of the high - density layer . if we take @xmath113 , which is about the thickness of thin filaments detected in w44 at 20 cm continuum emission ( jones et al 1993 ) , we have @xmath114 yr . employing , , ( sashida et al .",
    "2013 ) , and the mean molecular weight of 1.36 , we have @xmath115 this means a bh mass of greater than 3.4 @xmath90 could account for the kinetic energy of the bullet .",
    "the putative bh is currently inactive since the accretion has already ceased .",
    "conversely , a plunge of a high - velocity massive object into the high - density layer toward us could also explain the kinematics of the bullet ( fig .",
    "this process can be described by the bhl accretion formula as well .",
    "the upper part of the `` y '' shape can be interpreted as the shock wave propagating in the high - density layer , while the lower part might correspond to the `` wake '' accreting to the plunging object ( e.g. , edgar et al .",
    "again , the absence of a luminous stellar object favors a drifting , isolated bh as a candidate for the plunging object .",
    "the plunging velocity must be higher than @xmath116  but it is not necessarily as high as @xmath9  since gas in the `` wake '' is accelerating toward the object .",
    "of course , the initial kinetic energy of the plunging object , , must be greater than setting @xmath109 to the plunging velocity , we can calculate the total energy available from the bhl accretion by using equation ( 1 ) .",
    "this bhl energy @xmath117 must also be greater than @xmath118 .",
    "in addition , the bhl luminosity , @xmath119 , probably does not exceed the eddington limit ( @xmath120 ) . figure 4 shows the range of @xmath121 permitted by the above conditions , indicating that the plunging object must have a mass greater than @xmath122 .",
    "this shooting model , as well as the explosion model , can reproduce the broad velocity width and the enormous kinetic energy of the bullet .",
    "a naive shooting model predicts that the size of the accreting zone should be of the same order as the hoyle ",
    "litteleton radius , @xmath123 pc .",
    "since the observed size of the negative high - velocity tail of the is comparable to the telescope beamsize ( 22 ) , the real spatial size might be much smaller .",
    "moreover , the magneto - hydrodynamical effect can enlarge the accreting zone , which is roughly estimated by @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the alfvn velocity and @xmath112 is the thickness of the high - density layer ( nomura et al .",
    "2016 in prep . ) .",
    "the magnetic field strength should be enhanced in the shocked gas layer , and thereby increases @xmath125 and the size of the accreting zone accordingly .",
    "either scenario includes an isolated bh , which is currently inactive .",
    "but is it reasonable ?",
    "actually , there must be a number of invisible bhs in the galaxy .",
    "for example , agol &  kamionkowski ( 2002 ) estimated the total number of stellar mass bhs in the galaxy to be @xmath126 , which is far greater than the latest total number of the galactic bh candidates ( @xmath127 ) . assuming a spherically isotropic distribution with a radius of 30 kpc",
    ", this total bh number corresponds to a number density of @xmath128 pc@xmath129 .",
    "thus , we obtain the expected value of the bh number within the w44 shell ( 15 pc radius ) as 0.13 , which is not significantly low .",
    "note that this value may be a lower limit since an overdensity of bhs due to the disk population and a ob association ( @xmath130gelman et al .",
    "1976 ) is expected .",
    "considering the permitted mass ranges of an isolated bh , the explosion model seems to be more plausible .",
    "such an isolated , currently inactive bh with a mass was suggested as the driving source of the tornado nebula ( sakai et al .",
    "we also detected another extremely broad - velocity - width feature , co0.400.22 , in the central molecular zone of our galaxy ( oka et al .",
    "this was explained by a gravitational kick to the molecular cloud caused by an intermediate - mass bh .",
    "therefore , an elaborate search for compact high - velocity features using molecular lines might be an effective method of seeking inactive bhs in the galaxy and nearby galaxies .",
    "this paper is based on observations conducted using the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) 45-m telescope and aste .",
    "the nro is a branch of the national astronomical observatory of japan ( naoj ) , national institutes of natural sciences .",
