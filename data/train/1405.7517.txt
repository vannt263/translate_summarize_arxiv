    "the motion of small co - orbital satellites can be studied using the @xmath0 body problem .",
    "this is a restricted version of the @xmath5 problem of one central mass with @xmath6 other masses in a ring surrounding it , which was first studied by @xcite as a model of the motion of the rings of saturn . in the restricted version ,",
    "the @xmath6 orbiting masses @xmath7 interact with each other , but not the central mass @xmath8 i.e. the @xmath7 are infinitesimally small and @xmath9 tends to zero .",
    "the relative equilibria ( stationary configurations in a frame rotating with the co - orbiting satellites ) of both problems have been extensively studied in the context of central configurations : a configuration where the total ( newtonian ) acceleration of each body is proportional to the position vector of the body relative the centre of mass of the configuration .    the simplest version of the restricted @xmath0 body problem is planar with the co - orbiting satellites in circular orbits with the same mean motion and same mass .",
    "in this case the equilibrium configurations lie on a circle centred on the primary mass @xcite . for @xmath10",
    "there are several different equilibrium configurations possible ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : eq ] ) @xcite while for @xmath11 no configurations other than a regular 1+@xmath6-gon have been found , where the satellites are equally spaced in a circle about the central mass @xcite .",
    "numerical evidence has been provided for this ( e.g. @xcite ) and analytic proofs for the cases @xmath4 @xcite and @xmath12 @xcite , but it remains an open problem @xcite . in the unrestricted @xmath5 body problem this @xmath6-gon configuration has been shown to be linearly stable for @xmath13 for large mass ratios between the central mass and orbiting satellites @xcite , while in the circular restricted @xmath0 body problem numerical investigations have shown that at least one linearly stable configuration exists for @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the linear stability results in combination with the lyapunov centre theorem indicate that natural families of periodic orbits of the co - orbital satellites exist about these equilibrium configurations for each value of @xmath6 .    in the simplest case with @xmath2",
    "the problem is superintegrable and there are two well known stationary configurations with the satellites separated by either @xmath15 ( linearly stable ) or @xmath16 ( linearly unstable ) .",
    "the trajectories about the first are the familiar tadpole orbits ending on a homoclinic connection to the second equilibrium configuration . beyond this connection the trajectories are horseshoe orbits .",
    "such a co - orbital configuration is observed in the solar system in the dynamics of the satellites janus and epimetheus around saturn e.g. @xcite . for systems with three or more satellites the dynamics are more complex , for example @xcite look numerically at the dynamics about some of the equilibrium configurations for small values of @xmath6 and find both periodic motion and chaotic motion occurs .",
    "however , little appears to be known in general about the families of periodic orbits associated with these configurations for @xmath17 . since such periodic motion",
    "is observed in the solar system for @xmath2 the problem is worthy of further study .",
    "in addition to natural satellites , there are two other applications of such orbits in astrophysics : the first is the potential of such orbits to offer solutions for stable ` parking ' orbits of large numbers of small objects , such as captured asteroids around the moon ( for example the easily retrievable asteroids identified by @xcite ) or the moons of mars or larger main belt asteroids , for future in - situ resource use .",
    "knowledge of the primary families of periodic orbits associated with the problem , and their stability , form a basis of engineering such solutions .",
    "the second concerns exoplanetary systems .",
    "there has in recent years been significant interest in the idea of co - orbital or trojan planets : that is , planetary systems where two or more planets orbit at the same mean distance from their star .",
    "this idea was first explored in detail by @xcite , and has subsequently been the subject of numerous other works investigating not only the dynamics , but detectability and formation as well . almost all concentrate on two co - orbital planets , either both of similar mass or one of jupiter mass and another of earth - mass .",
    "although such configurations can remain ` stable ' for long times ( e.g. @xcite ) and numerical models show plausible formation mechanisms ( e.g. @xcite ) , analysis of photometric and radial velocity data has yet to reveal any such system @xcite .    much of the work on the dynamics of exoplanetary co - orbital planets considers either two co - orbital eccentric gas giant planets in the general three - body problem or terrestrial planets at the classical triangular lagrangian points in the eccentric restricted three - body problem .",
    "the @xmath0 body problem on the other hand is suitable for non - negligible but low mass ratios and small eccentricities and so is more suited to similar mass terrestrial planets in roughly circular orbits .",
    "such systems have been less discussed in the literature than those with giant planets .    in this work",
    "we look at the primary families of periodic orbits emanating from the equilibrium configurations for @xmath18 equal mass satellites , as well as some secondary connecting families , using the boundary - value problem methods implemented in the numerical continuation software auto @xcite .",
    "a summary of the known equilibrium configurations is presented in section [ sec : eq ] and details of the periodic orbits associated with them in section [ sec : po ] .",
    "the equations of motion of the circular restricted @xmath0 body problem have been derived by several authors , including @xcite . here",
    "we follow that of @xcite .",
    "all masses are assumed to be point masses , and the @xmath6 co - orbital satellites to be in a circular and planar orbit with the same average mean motion @xmath19 and radius @xmath20 . in a frame",
    "centred on the central mass rotating with the average mean motion the position of a satellite is described by its angular position @xmath21 relative to an arbitrary reference direction and the relative displacement from the mean radius @xmath22 .",
    "units can be chosen such that @xmath20 , @xmath19 and the mass of the central object @xmath8 are all unity .",
    "the equations of motion are then @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    "this system also assumes that there are no close approaches between the satellites , otherwise the motion will not remain co - orbital .",
    "the problem is also hamiltonian and the @xmath26 are related to the conjugate momenta to the co - ordinates @xmath21 .",
    "there are three integrals of motion for this system : @xmath27 the first two correspond to the invariance of the system under rotations and hence the conservation of angular momentum and the last is the energy integral , or jacobi constant .",
    "the system [ eq : eom1 ] is a first order dynamical system in @xmath28 .",
    "however , the integrals of motion given by [ eq : int1 ] and [ eq : int2 ] can be used to reduce the system to @xmath29 by eliminating a pair of the @xmath30 and @xmath26 coordinates . for convenience",
    "a new angular coordinate @xmath30 can be defined as @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "the angle @xmath30 now represents the angular separation of satellites @xmath33 from satellite 1 .",
    "given @xmath34 the position of satellite 1 is then constrained through eq .",
    "( [ eq : int2 ] ) .",
    "similarly eq .",
    "( [ eq : int1 ] ) allows the radial displacement @xmath35 of satellite 1 to be eliminated from the equations of motion as well with no need for the introduction of any other new co - ordinates .",
    "the new equations of motion are for example in the case @xmath4 with equal masses @xmath36 : @xmath37 although this is not a canonical transform the numerical continuation does not require the system to be in canonical co - ordinates and this form is convenient to work with .",
    "the reduction also does not affect the linear stability : one pair of eigenvalues in the original system will represent the invariance under rotation and it is these that are not present in the reduced system .",
    "the equations of motion possess a number of symmetries which are relevant to the equilibria and periodic orbits .",
    "firstly , there is a reversing symmetry @xmath38 .",
    "a second less obvious reversing symmetry is due to the nature of the function @xmath39 , and is a symmetry about a line through the equilibrium configuration .",
    "@xcite look at the @xmath40 body problem and prove that all relative equilibria are symmetric about a symmetry line , and that either two satellites lie on the symmetry line or none do ( one of the configuration in fact possess several symmetry lines , and is of both types ) .",
    "@xcite discuss symmetries of the @xmath0 body problem , noting similarly that there are two cases that occur for equal masses : satellites on the symmetry line ( one if @xmath6 is odd or two if @xmath6 is even ) or no satellites on the symmetry line .",
    "in addition , the case of equal masses has an additional spatial symmetry that is less obvious : @xmath41 in the coordinates used here .",
    "we can write @xmath42 without need for multiplication by @xmath7 , implying @xmath43 ( as the mean radius is assumed to be 1 ) .",
    "thus @xmath44 from eq .",
    "[ eq : eom1 ] and @xmath45 .",
    "however , @xmath46 is a sum of angles and thus @xmath47 also .",
    "the dynamics depend only on the relative angular separation of each satellite rather than the location relative to the reference direction , so for any give value of @xmath46 a rotation of the entire configuration by @xmath48 also exists .",
    "this additional symmetry is seen by @xcite for equilibria in the @xmath49 body problem when the masses are equal .",
    "the consequence of the symmetry are seen in the connections between the families of periodic orbits emanating from the equilibria , and is discussed further in section [ sec : po ] .",
    "the requirement that @xmath50 means that @xmath51 for all equilibrium configurations so that the satellites are all located on the mean circle with angular separations are given by solving @xmath52 . @xcite",
    "determine the stationary configurations for @xmath2 to 9 for equal mass satellites , using numerical methods for @xmath6 greater than 3 .",
    "the configurations for @xmath53 are shown in table [ tab : eqcf ] for a fixed value of the angular momentum constant @xmath46 .",
    "there are three distinct types of equilibrium configuration , which @xcite label as type i ( arranged in a ` line ' ) , type ii ( arranged in an @xmath6-gon ) and type iii ( arrange in a line with one satellite on the opposite side ) with subdivisions a and b for the type i and iii cases ( as for some higher values of @xmath6 two variants of these configurations exist ) . as mentioned , for @xmath11 the only configuration known to exist is type ii , and it appears to be always linearly stable .",
    "in addition to the numerical evidence provided by numerous authors , @xcite provides a more general analytic proof that places a bound on @xmath6 as greater than approximately @xmath54 for this to be the case .",
    "the three types can be defined as follows : type ii is the simple case of equal spacing , and is linearly stable for @xmath55 at least .",
    "the type ii configuration is unaffected by a rotation by @xmath48 up to an interchange of satellites , and has several symmetry lines .",
    "type i has the satellites in an arc with the spacing increasing from the central pairs outwards .",
    "it is symmetric with respect to a symmetry line through the configuration .",
    "type iii has @xmath56 satellites in a similar arc and the remaining one on the opposite side , and has similar symmetry .",
    "for the type i and type iii configurations @xmath56 other alignments of the configuration other than that shown in the table also exist .",
    "a numerical search for equilibria for @xmath57 was also performed as part of this work and no other configurations were found in agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "the problem is hamiltonian and thus the eigenvalues of the linearized system occur in reciprocal ( and complex conjugate ) pairs . @xcite",
    "provide the linear stability of each configuration , and the spectrum for each point is shown in the table , excluding the pair of eigenvalues which are zero in the full system .",
    "note that the eigenvalues for the type ii configuration occur in degenerate pairs .",

    "has been applied numerous times in the context of celestial mechanics , for example to the crtbp by @xcite and @xcite and to choreographies of the @xmath6-body problem by @xcite . given a solution of the reduced system",

    "the linear stability of a periodic orbit can be determined from its floquet multipliers .",
    "these are the eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix ( the state transition matrix evaluated around the orbit ) or equivalently the eigenvalues of the linearized poincar map .",
    "the floquet multipliers of each periodic orbit are calculated by auto , so information about the linear stability is provided for each continued family . as this is a hamiltonian system the floquet multipliers occur in inverse and complex conjugate pairs , with one pair always be equal to unity for a periodic orbit . hence true linear stability ( all multipliers within the unit circle ) is not possible in hamiltonian systems . instead",
    "the linear stability can be described as different orders of instability , depending on how many pairs of multipliers are on the unit circle . for for @xmath108",

    "such changes generically occur through either collisions of one pair of multipliers at @xmath112 ( tangent bifurcation : fold or branch point to another family ) or @xmath113 ( period - doubling bifurcation ) . for @xmath4",
    "the collision of two pairs of multipliers on the unit circle ( krein collision ) or real axis ( inverse krein collision ) is also possible .      as stated in section [ sec : po ] the lyapunov centre theorem can be used to determine the existence of natural families emanating from those configurations with ( non - resonant ) centre eigenvalues . for @xmath114",
    "there are no resonances between any of the purely imaginary eigenvalues associated with each equilibrium configuration .",
    "thus for a given configuration , each centre frequency ( purely imaginary eigenvalues ) has a family of periodic orbits associated with it .",
    "the linear stability of each configuration is given in table [ tab : eqcf ] .",
    "so for example , the @xmath3 case has three families that emanate from the equilibria : two associated with the type ia equilibrium ( linear stability centre - centre ) and one associated with the type iiia equilibrium ( linear stability centre - saddle ) .",

    "note that the ii configuration has no centre frequencies for @xmath2 and @xmath3 and thus there are no families emanating from it .",
    "this does not preclude the existence of families not associated with the equilibria , for example horseshoe orbits in the case @xmath2 .",
    "for a given equilibrium configuration the families associated with each configuration can be labelled as @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 and so on , in order of increasing frequency ( and thus decreasing period ) .",
    "for example , the ia equilibrium for @xmath4 has three centre frequencies , i.e. it has eigenvalues of the form @xmath118 , with @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "the @xmath115 family is associated with the @xmath121 frequency and has a period that tends to @xmath122 as the family tends to the equilibrium , the @xmath116 family is associated with the @xmath123 frequency has a period @xmath124 at the equilibrium and the @xmath117 family a period @xmath125 at the equilibrium .",
    "the label for the equilibrium configuration can be added to the end of the designator , as well as a subscript to distinguish the value of @xmath6 .",

    "in addition , as before the type ia and iiia configurations can be rotated by @xmath142 for a given value of @xmath46 .",
    "thus there are nine possible equilibrium configurations for any given value of @xmath46 , as the ia and iiia equilibria can be rotated three times by @xmath142 . as for the previous systems with @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "this affects the connections between families of periodic orbits .",
    "there are three families associated with the ia equilibrium for this value of @xmath6 .",
    "the first family @xmath143 connects to the other alignments of the @xmath144 configurations via a branch point that is also a connection to the higher symmetry family @xmath145 associated with the @xmath146 configuration .",
    "further , this is a degenerate branch point , as the family @xmath147 also connects to @xmath145 at the same point .",
    "one branch of the @xmath144 family is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : n4families ] , with the branching orbit plotted in blue .",
    "the connection of @xmath143 and @xmath147 to the @xmath145 family is similar to the symmetry - breaking pitchfork bifurcations that occur in the crtbp ( e.g. the north and south branches of the halo family from the planar lyapunov family ) .",
    "the four branches could be considered to be the north , east , south and west branches of the @xmath143 family . similarly in the @xmath2 case the @xmath128 family has two branches , while in the @xmath3 case the @xmath148 and @xmath149 families have three branches associated with the @xmath150 symmetry .    the family @xmath151 is also shown fig .",
    "[ fig : n4families ] .",
    "it ends in a connection to @xmath143 via a reverse period - doubling bifurcation .",
    "an additional family ( labelled @xmath152 ) branches off @xmath151 and reconnects further along the family .",
    "this family branches off in a symmetry - breaking pitchfork bifurcation , the new family losing the reversing symmetry @xmath138 .    the family @xmath153 appears to connect to @xmath143 twice : once as a reverse - period tripling bifurcation , and finally ending at a reverse period - quadrupling bifurcation , behaviour very similar to the planar families associated with the l4 and l5 points in the crtbp .",
    "it also has a number of other branch points to four other families , that can be labelled @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 in the order they branch from the original family .    a schematic bifurcation diagram summarizing the connections between the primary families emanating from the ia equilibrium configuration is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bfdiag ] . the linear stability and the location of various bifurcations",
    "are also shown .",
    "in the diagram each primary family is represented as a single line emanating from a particular equilibrium configuration , as labelled .",
    "( note that this diagram shows only one branch of each family ) .",
    "the various bifurcations along each family are indicated by various symbols on this line ( as defined in the key in fig .",
    "[ fig : bfdiag3 ] ) .",
    "further , the linear stability of the family is indicated through dashing or dotting of the line representing the family .",
    "for example , the @xmath158 family is represented as the horizontal line labelled @xmath115 , starting at the equilibrium labelled @xmath159 on the left of the diagram ( represented as a large square ) and ending at the degenerate branch point on the vertical line which represents the @xmath160 family .",
    "the various bifurcations along the family are shown as indicated , and the linear stability can for example be seen to change from order-0 initially to order-1 after a fold ( gray square ) , and so on .",
    "[ fig : bfdiag1 ] shows the connections between the primary families from the type ia , ii and iiia configurations ( for a description of the families associated with the ii and iiia configurations see the next two subsections ) .",
    "the @xmath161 and @xmath162 families are complex and their linear stability and bifurcations are not represented fully on this first schematic diagram .",
    "instead only the points at which they connect to the @xmath163 family are shown . the full bifurcation diagram for these two families , including the secondary families connecting to the branch points in the ia families",
    "are shown separately in the schematic bifurcation diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : bfdiag2 ] .",
    "note that whereas these diagrams show all branch points , folds and period - doubling bifurcations , the only period tripling and quadrupling bifurcations that have been detected are those between the three primary families associated with the @xmath159 configuration .",
    "the secondary families have been labelled in the order they branch off the primary family .",
    "there is one family branching from @xmath151 ( @xmath152 ) and four from @xmath153 ( @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 ) as discussed above , as well as one family labelled @xmath168 that connects between @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "all these secondary families are shown in the appendix , and it is worth noting that several of them also have some order-0 instability , for example the relatively complex asymmetric family labelled @xmath168 is completely neutrally linearly stable .",
    "there is one family associated with the @xmath146 configuration : a family of symmetric horseshoe - type orbits @xmath145 . as for its associated equilibrium point ,",
    "this family of periodic orbits has degenerate floquet multipliers ( the two non - trivial pairs are equal ) , as evidenced by the double branch point to the @xmath143 and @xmath147 families .",
    "the @xmath145 family only has one branch ( unlike the four branches of the ia and iiia families ) , as it is invariant under rotation by @xmath142 up to the interchange of satellites .",
    "interestingly , some of the horseshoe orbits in the @xmath145 family have order-0 instability .",
    "this occurs just after the double branch point shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:8d ] , but is ended shortly later along the family by a period - doubling bifurcation .",
    "as for the @xmath144 configuration there are four possible alignments of the @xmath169 configuration , and thus four rotated branches of the two associated families .",
    "the first , @xmath147 , behaves similarly to the @xmath143 family and connects to the branches from the other alignments of the configuration at the degenerate branch point in the @xmath145 family .",
    "the second , @xmath151 , is a tadpole - like family , and ends on a homoclinic orbit from the @xmath146 equilibrium . unlike the @xmath143 and @xmath145 families",
    "there are no regions of order-0 stability along either of the @xmath169 families .",
    "both are initially order-1 , with the @xmath147 family transitioning to order-2 after a fold .",
    "as the @xmath170 family evolves towards the homoclinic orbit it undergoes an infinite series of pairs of branch points and pairs of period - doubling bifurcations .",
    "the pair of floquet multipliers on the real axis tend to zero and infinity , while the pair on the unit circle circulate with increasing frequency , briefly moving off onto the real axis at each bifurcation .",
    "the first two families branching off connect to the @xmath147 family through reverse period quadrupling bifurcations .",
    "this behaviour is similar to that of the the planar lyapunov families around the triangular equilibrium points in the crbtp ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "all six primary families for @xmath4 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : n4families ] in the spatial plan .",
    "in addition , the families are shown in the energy - period plane in fig .",
    "[ fig : stabind ] .",
    "the order-0 portion of each family is highlighted in this plot .",
    "note that the connection of the @xmath143 and @xmath147 families to the @xmath145 family can be clearly seen in this plane .",
    "the six primary families are shown plotted in the energy - period plane in fig .",
    "[ fig : stabind ] . the order-0 portion of each family is again highlighted .",

    "the primary families @xmath143 , @xmath151 , @xmath153 , @xmath147 and @xmath170 emanating from the ia and iiia equilibria are symmetric about the symmetry line of the associated equilibrium configuration .",
    "they also possess the reversing symmetry @xmath138 , @xmath139 .",
    "the family @xmath145 emanating from the type ii equilibrium is symmetric about ( both ) symmetry lines of the equilibrium configuration and is also symmetric under @xmath171 .",
    "it too has the reversing symmetry @xmath138 , @xmath139 .",
    "the family @xmath152 branching from @xmath151 is not symmetric about the symmetry line of the equilibrium , but still possess the reversing symmetry @xmath138 , @xmath139 .",
    "the families @xmath154 and @xmath156 branching from @xmath153 do not have the possess the reversing symmetry @xmath138 , @xmath139 but are symmetric about the symmetry line of the equilibrium , while the families @xmath155 and @xmath157 are not symmetric about the symmetry line of the equilibrium but do possess the @xmath172 reversing symmetry .",
    "the family @xmath168 that connects between branch points in the @xmath155 and @xmath156 families possesses no symmetries .",
    "it should be noted that those families that do not possess one of the reversing symmetries have two symmetric branches , similar to for example the axial families in the crbtp . because it lacks both reversing symmetries there are four branches of the @xmath168 family , connecting between the two branches of each of the @xmath155 and @xmath156 families .",
    "the six primary families emanating from the equilibrium configurations for @xmath4 , in the energy - period plane .",
    "the ia familes are shown in red , the ii family in green and the iiia families in blue .",
    "the energy level of each equilibrium is also shown , and note that the families are labelled @xmath115 , @xmath116 etc in order of increasing initial period .",
    "solid lines indicated order-0 stability , dotted lines order-1 or order-2 stability ]",
    "the families associated with the equilibrium configurations of the planar restricted @xmath0-body problem are complex and exhibit a variety of interesting dynamical phenomena , such as homoclinic connections and degenerate symmetry - breaking bifurcations . for @xmath53",
    "the families associated with the type ii equilibria resemble classical horseshoe orbits , while some associated with the type i and type iii equilibria resemble tadpole orbits . in addition",
    ", there are many other periodic orbits , both symmetric and asymmetric exhibiting different linear stability properties ( although note that vertical stability of the orbits is not considered here ) .",
    "while exactly equal mass satellites and asteroids in the solar system are unlikely to occur , the equilibrium configurations are known to exist in such cases ( e.g. @xcite ) and as such the periodic orbits presented here provide a starting point for exploring such systems .",
    "preliminary investigation of unequal mass satellites have shown that many families of periodic still exist .",
    "while this work has only considered up to four equal mass satellites the linear stability of the known equilibria for @xmath173 indicate a large number of families of periodic orbits exist in these cases as well .",
    "for example , for @xmath174 there are type ia , ii and iiia equilibria as for the @xmath4 case , and it is found that there are two families emanating from the type ii configuration , one of which connects to the type ia equilibrium point and one of which connects to the type iiia equilibrium point .",
    "the families remain of similar types to those seen in this work : largely tadpole or horseshoe type .",
    "it should be noted here that the @xmath0-body problem is a restricted problem , and for the periodic orbits to be reproducible in the unrestricted system the mass ratios must be low . while this is not a problem for asteroids around planets or large moons in the solar system it can become an issue when considering trojan exoplanetary systems .",
    "however , direct numerical integration of the full @xmath6-body equations of motion of an example order-0 periodic orbit from the @xmath168 family shows for example four earth - mass co - orbital planets at 1 au from a solar - mass star are well represented by this model .",
    "we also note that such a periodic orbit of four earth - mass planets would have a period of approximately 250 years , making detection of the co - orbital dynamics difficult .",
    "however , the existence of neutrally linearly stable periodic orbits of four trojans still presents an interesting possibility for exoplanetary systems .",
    "the question remains whether such orbits could exist ( or be engineered ) in the solar system or exoplanetary systems .",
    "for co - orbital asteroids , the easily retrievable asteroids suitable for capture into the earth - moon system identified by @xcite are at most diameter 65 m , with those that are retrievable in the near - term generally below 4 m diameter , which corresponds to @xmath175 to @xmath176 ( assuming an average density of 2 g/@xmath177 ) . for these extremely low mass ratios the co - orbital dynamics",
    "will be negligible compared to other perturbations .",
    "( by comparison , an asteroid with a higher mass ratio of @xmath178 would correspond to an spherical object roughly of diameter 40 km . )",
    "this is in some sense a self - solving problem : if the asteroids do not significantly perturb each others orbits , there is no need to consider placing them in a stable parking configuration .",
    "it should also be noted that the @xmath0 body problem is not a good approximation of asteroid orbits about the moon regardless of mass ratio , as the perturbations from the earth can not be ignored .",
    "the families of periodic orbits found here however provide a starting point for more advanced models of the dynamics .",
    "the mechanism by which asteroids could be transferred into such orbits is as well is another topic , but knowledge of the possible orbital configurations will also assist such endeavours .",
