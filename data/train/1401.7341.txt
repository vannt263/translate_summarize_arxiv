    "with advancing quantum technologies that are able to coherently manipulate quantum objects the interest in dynamics of quantum systems is increasing .",
    "of particular importance is understanding their nonequilibrium properties .",
    "however , there is a fundamental obstacle : while the theoretical formalism for describing equilibrium systems is well known , there is no universal formalism applicable to nonequilibrium situations . in certain simple states , most notable",
    "are nonequilibrium steady states ( nesss ) to which nonequilibrium systems converge after a long time , a general method though is known .",
    "it was originally developed in probability theory and is known as the large - deviation ( ld ) formalism  @xcite .",
    "provided one is able to calculate the relevant quantities of the ld formalism  the cumulant generating function and the large - deviation function  one has access to a full distribution function of an observable , say of a nonequilibrium current .",
    "formal mathematical manipulations involved are actually analogous to equilibrium statistical mechanics which invokes the legendre transformation to relate different thermodynamic potentials that in turn determine probability distributions . in fact , the mathematical language of statistical mechanics is the ld formalism , although it is usually not presented as such .",
    "the very reason that one can speak about intensive thermodynamic quantities , such as temperature , is that in large systems fluctuations are small , which is nothing but a mathematical statement that the ld principle holds .",
    "we also note that recently a somewhat related concept called the concentration of measure gained popularity in physics  @xcite .",
    "while the statements there , namely the concentration about the average , are in a sense more general , they give only an upper bound on the probability of fluctuations .",
    "the ld theory on the other hand gives a precise quantitative statement , but is valid only asymptotically in the limit of a large sample size ( what is a sample size depends on the context ; in our case it is the duration of current measurement , in equilibrium statistical mechanics it is usually system size ) .",
    "the ld approach is well developed for classical equilibrium systems  @xcite .",
    "a bit less is known about equilibrium quantum systems .",
    "for instance , one tries to rigorously , using @xmath0 algebra , prove the validity of the ld principle , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite . treating nonequilibrium systems ,",
    "for instance nesss , is more complicated . in general , one expects universal features to appear only in the thermodynamic limit ( tdl ) and therefore , even though the physics of small systems might be of interest  @xcite , an especially sought - for are exact ld solutions of large systems .",
    "most exact nonequilibrium calculations of large deviation fluctuations have been done for classical stochastic models , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "applications of the ld method to quantum systems are more scarce  @xcite .",
    "most deal with small systems , such as one or two qubits  @xcite , or the mean field approximation  @xcite .",
    "recently , the ld formalism for the current in a coherent ballistic xx spin chain in the tdl has been provided  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for some results ) showing an interesting nonanalytic behavior .",
    "nonanalytic behavior of ld functions can be either due to a degenerate ness  @xcite or , more interestingly , due to a genuine nonequilibrium phase transition .    for diffusive systems ,",
    "provided certain conditions are met , a general theory of nonequilibrium fluctuations can be developed .",
    "this is called macroscopic fluctuation theory  @xcite and it can for instance predict the probability of observing nonequilibrium density profiles as well as currents  @xcite .",
    "another useful rule is the additivity principle  @xcite that can , similarly as the macroscopic fluctuation theory , predict the ld function based on only the first two cumulants . so far both principles have been verified mostly for classical stochastic models  @xcite .    in the present work we provide a solution for current fluctuations in a diffusive quantum model , namely for a driven xx spin chain with dephasing , and we show that the additivity principle holds .",
    "the dynamics of the system studied will be governed by the lindblad equation  @xcite , @xmath1+\\cl^{\\rm dis}\\rho,\\\\ & & \\quad \\cl^{\\rm dis}\\rho=\\sum_j 2 l_j\\rho l_j^\\dagger - l_j^\\dagger l_j \\rho - \\rho l_j^\\dagger l_j , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we denote the right - hand - side as a liouvillian operator @xmath2 acting on a density matrix .",
    "we shall calculate current fluctuations in the ness , which is the state @xmath3 that is a solution of the stationary liouville equation @xmath4 .",
    "we also note that most existing solutions for the ld function or cumulants in nonequilibrium quantum systems have been obtained within the lindblad setting , besides those already mentioned , see also e.g.  @xcite .",
    "cumulants can also be used to infer unknown lindblad generators  @xcite from a measured dynamics .",
    "a large - deviation approach is a systematical mathematical procedure by which we can calculate a distribution function of a sum of random variables in the limit of summing a large number of variables .",
    "provided the central limit theorem is valid , we know that the fluctuations around the average are gaussian .",
    "the large - deviation formalism goes beyond that by providing the whole distribution function , predicting , for instance , also the probability of large fluctuations .",
    "physicists are actually familiar with the basic steps of the formalism .",
    "namely , the mathematical formalism of equilibrium statistical mechanics , with legendre transformation relating various thermodynamic potentials , for instance , the entropy and the free energy , is nothing but the large - deviation formalism .",
    "the entropy plays the role of a large - deviation function ( up to a sign and an additive constant ) while the free energy plays the role of a cumulant generating function .",
    "indeed , we know that the entropy determines the probability of a given microstate , similarly to how the large - deviation function determines the probability that a random variable has a certain value",
    ". the mathematical details about the large - deviation formalism were worked - out in 60 , and its use in statistical physics was `` advertised '' in 80  @xcite , see also the recent review  @xcite for an exposition .",
    "let us have a look on how the formalism works on a particular observable , which we shall call a current @xmath5 , and its closely related integrated quantity , called the number of particles , @xmath6",
    ". we shall be interested in a stationary ( in general , nonequilibrium ) distribution of current , or , equivalently , of the number of transferred particles in time @xmath7 .",
    "time @xmath7 is our scaling variable ( analogous to the number of random variables in a sum , if we were interested in the fluctuation properties of a sum of random variables ) .",
    "the statement of the ld formalism is that if @xmath8 satisfies a so - called ld property then its probability distribution @xmath9 decays exponentially for large @xmath7 , and it can therefore be written as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is called a ld function ( also a rate function ) and @xmath12 is the average current as determined by counting the number of transferred particles in time @xmath7 .",
    "the sign @xmath13 is meant to denote that the relation holds for large @xmath7 and up to an irrelevant normalization constant that we do not write out .",
    "the goal of the ld formalism is to calculate the ld function @xmath11 .",
    "the simplest method to get @xmath14 is via the g \" artner - ellis theorem .",
    "the procedure begins by calculating the moment generating function @xmath15 ( the average is in our nonequilibrium setting over different realizations ( measurements ) of variable @xmath8 ) and from it the cumulant generating function @xmath16 , @xmath17 the theorem then says that if @xmath16 is differentiable for all @xmath18 , then the ld function is given by the legendre - fenchel transform of @xmath16 , @xmath19 and the probability distribution for large @xmath7 is @xmath20 for strictly convex @xmath16 the legendre - fenchel transform simplifies to a more familiar legendre transform @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the unique solution of @xmath23 .",
    "we see that the crucial step is to calculate the cumulant generating function @xmath16 .",
    "once we have it , we can calculate @xmath11 as well as , for instance , the current cumulants . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : l ] ) we see that the derivatives of @xmath16 are cumulants of @xmath8 , or , because we have @xmath24 , also appropriately scaled current cumulants , @xmath25^r}_{\\rm c } , \\label{eq : jr}\\ ] ] where the subscript `` c '' denotes the cumulant .",
    "we shall call the @xmath26-th derivative of @xmath16 simply a ( scaled ) current cumulant and denote it by @xmath27 .",
    "because one has @xmath6 , we immediately see that the @xmath26-th cumulant of @xmath8 can be expressed in terms of an @xmath26-point time correlation function of the current @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , in order to be able to calculate these cumulants in the ness , we will have to go beyond just calculating the ness because @xmath3 itself only gives a time - independent part of a state .",
    "for markovian processes the cumulant generating function is equal to the largest eigenvalue of a so - called tilted liouvillian . to see how the tilted liouvillian is constructed , it is easiest to think in terms of a stochastic unraveling of our lindblad equation , i.e. , in terms of a stochastic wavefunction @xmath28 that exhibits stochastic jumps according to the lindblad operators involved .",
    "the lindblad dissipator ( [ eq : lin ] ) @xmath29 has two types of terms : one is the so - called jump term @xmath30 that in stochastic unraveling induces jumps @xmath31 , and the other , @xmath32 , can be thought of as being part of a non - hermitean hamiltonian , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "in particular , assuming that all lindblad operators are such that terms involving @xmath33 do not change @xmath8 while the jump terms change @xmath8 by either @xmath34 or @xmath35 , the tilted liouvillian @xmath36 is obtained multiplying the jump term by the weight @xmath37 .",
    "specifically , grouping lindblad operators @xmath38 in three sets : the set @xmath39 of those @xmath38 that do not change @xmath8 , the set @xmath40 of those @xmath38 that change @xmath8 by @xmath41 , and the set @xmath42 of operators that change @xmath8 by @xmath43 , we can write the tilted liouvillian dissipator @xmath44 as a sum of three parts , @xmath45 , with @xmath46 the tilted liouvillian @xmath36 is obtained by simply using @xmath44 instead of @xmath47 in the lindblad equation ( [ eq : lin ] ) . the cumulant generating function @xmath16 is then equal to the largest eigenvalue of @xmath36 . to see this ,",
    "let us decompose @xmath48 into @xmath49-resolved density matrices @xmath50 , being the part of @xmath48 that has @xmath51 .",
    "writing @xmath52 in terms of an average  @xcite over stochastic trajectories @xmath53 , where we labeled a trajectory by an index @xmath49 denoting the value of @xmath8 , i.e. , being equal to the number of up jumps minus the number of down jumps upto time @xmath7 , we have @xmath54  @xcite . with @xmath50 ,",
    "the probability is simply @xmath55 . defining an @xmath18-transformed @xmath56",
    ", we also have @xmath57 . because @xmath8 is changed only by the jump terms from @xmath58 , the n - resolved @xmath50 satisfies the master equation @xmath59 .",
    "multiplying the equation by @xmath60 and summing over @xmath49 , we finally obtain the equation for @xmath61 , which is @xmath62 , with the dissipative part of @xmath36 being given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : til ] ) . for large @xmath7",
    ", the norm of @xmath63 will grow with a rate given by the eigenvalue of @xmath36 that has the largest real part , and therefore the cumulant generating function @xmath16 is equal to the eigenvalue of @xmath36 with the largest real part .",
    "observe that for @xmath64 we have an ordinary non - tilted lindblad equation and therefore one always has @xmath65 .",
    "for more details on the ld formalism , see ref .",
    "@xcite .    in mesoscopic physics and quantum optics one is often interested in current cumulants as they can contain information about a system s properties . in 90 a so - called full counting approach was suggested  @xcite that is used to calculate cumulants .",
    "while the ld and the full counting approach are very similar  formally , in full counting statistics the weight used is @xmath66 instead of @xmath67  the analytic properties of the calculated eigenvalue are quite different .",
    "for instance , an added bonus in the ld approach is that one gets , besides just cumulants , which by themselves are not very informative , also a full distribution function together with a thermodynamic - like formalism relating @xmath16 and @xmath11 .",
    "this makes it possible to study the nonanalytic properties of the rate function @xmath11 , for an example see ref .",
    "@xcite , which would not be possible by studying only cumulants . vaguely speaking",
    ", the greater power of the ld formalism lies in sampling stochastic trajectories with an exponentially larger / smaller probability @xmath37 , instead of using just a phase , and thereby inferring the probability of orbits carrying more or less current than on average .",
    "the hamiltonian of our model is given by the xx spin chain , @xmath68 where @xmath69 are standard pauli matrices and the chain has @xmath70 sites .",
    "the dissipative part is described by a set of lindblad operators @xmath38 ( [ eq : lin ] ) . for a boundary driven xx chain with dephasing studied here",
    "we are going to use @xmath71 driving lindblad operators @xmath38 at chain ends , i.e. , at the first and the last site , and @xmath70 dephasing lindblad operators , one for each lattice site .",
    "lindblad operators representing driving are given by the following expressions , @xmath72 with @xmath73 .",
    "dephasing lindblad operator at site @xmath74 is on the other hand @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the dephasing strength .",
    "@xmath70 dephasing lindblad operators ( [ eq : ldeph ] ) together with @xmath71 boundary ones ( [ eq : ls ] ) constitute a set of operators @xmath38 in the lindblad equation ( [ eq : lin ] ) .",
    "we are interested in current statistics in the ness state @xmath3 . while the ness itself can be calculated exactly  @xcite ( because of a decoupled hierarchy of correlations , see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) here we are going to study current fluctuations , which requires us to solve a more complicated tilted - liouvillian equation .",
    "let us briefly explain the role of all parameters .",
    "@xmath77 are coupling strengths between the chain and the bath at the left / right chain end .",
    "most of the time we shall have the same coupling at both ends , @xmath78 .",
    "one should be aware that in order for the measured quantities ( e.g. , the current or the magnetization profile ) to reflect the system s bulk properties , the coupling @xmath79 in a one - dimensional boundary driven system should be of order @xmath80 .",
    "in particular , one should not use small @xmath81 as this limit is singular ; for perturbative results for the xxz spin chain see  @xcite ( for instance , for small @xmath79 the current scales as @xmath82 while the magnetization scales as @xmath83 , resulting in a diverging transport coefficient , regardless of the true nature of bulk conductivity ) .",
    "@xmath76 is the dephasing strength whose nonzero value causes the scaling of the current @xmath84 with the system s size and linear magnetization profile in the bulk  @xcite , both being characteristic features of diffusive systems .",
    "four driving lindblad operators ( [ eq : ls ] ) try to induce the average magnetization @xmath85 at the left chain end and @xmath86 at the right end , therefore , @xmath87 is the average magnetization in a stationary state and @xmath88 is a nonequilibrium driving parameter .",
    "if @xmath89 , we have an equilibrium driving ; if @xmath90 , we will get a nonequilibrium steady state with a linear magnetization profile .",
    "the allowed values of @xmath88 and @xmath87 are such that all the square - roots in four @xmath70 s ( [ eq : ls ] ) are real . without sacrificing generality , we can limit to @xmath91 $ ] and @xmath92 $ ] .    to study large deviation statistics of the magnetization current in a stationary state , we need a tilted generator @xmath36 ( [ eq : ls ] ) .",
    "we are going to measure the size of the transferred magnetization at the right chain end . to achieve that",
    ", we add a factor @xmath93 with @xmath94 and a factor @xmath95 with @xmath96 , i.e. , we have sets @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 . note that , because we use a factor @xmath100 instead of @xmath101 in our definition of @xmath36 ( after one application of , say , @xmath102 , the expectation value of @xmath103 changes by @xmath104 , not by @xmath80 ) , we are in fact studying the particle current @xmath105 , @xmath106 and not the true magnetization current , being equal to @xmath107 .",
    "cumulant @xmath108 of the magnetization current can be simply obtained as @xmath109 .",
    "to sum - up , in order to evaluate ld statistics , we need the largest eigenvalue @xmath16 of the tilted liouvillian ( [ eq : til],[eq : lin ] ) .",
    "we shall first analytically calculate the exact expressions for the 2nd current cumulant in equilibrium and out of equilibrium .",
    "it turns out that this 2nd moment scales as @xmath110 with system size , similarly as the 1st cumulant , i.e. , the average current  @xcite .",
    "the model is diffusive , and it has been argued that for such models one can use a so - called additivity property to get higher - order cumulants just from knowledge of the first two .",
    "the additivity has so - far been demonstrated for classical models such as various exclusion models . in the next section , we shall use the 2nd moment calculated here to confirm the validity of the additivity principle also for a diffusive quantum spin chain .",
    "we are going to use perturbation theory in the tilting parameter @xmath18 in order to analytically calculate the 2nd current cumulant , i.e. , current fluctuations .    in equilibrium",
    "when @xmath89 the exact ness solution at @xmath64 is very simple and equal to @xmath111  @xcite . for small @xmath18 we can make an expansion of the largest eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector of @xmath36 as @xmath112 , and @xmath113 .",
    "the liouvillian @xmath36 can be expanded as well , @xmath114 , where , because @xmath36 depends on @xmath18 only via the liouvillian @xmath115 of the right bath ( involving lindblad operators @xmath116 ) , we have simple explicit forms of @xmath117 and @xmath118 , @xmath119 the matrices are written in the basis @xmath120 and we wrote - out only the nontrivial part acting on the last @xmath121th spin . noting that for the largest eigenvalue one always has @xmath122 , we get two lowest order perturbative equations , @xmath123 projecting on @xmath124 ( i.e. , taking a trace ) we get the equation for the eigenvalue correction , @xmath125 .",
    "the first term is always zero because @xmath126 is trace preserving , while the 2nd term is zero for equilibrium @xmath127 as one can readily check using the explicit form of @xmath127 .",
    "therefore , of course , @xmath128 , i.e. , the average current in equilibrium is zero , @xmath129 . with this , the eigenvalue equation for @xmath130 simplifies in equilibrium to @xmath131 solving it , we can then use @xmath130 in the expression for the 2nd order correction to the eigenvalue , obtained by projecting the 2nd equation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pert ] ) , @xmath132 to summarize , in order to obtain the 2nd cumulant @xmath133 in equilibrium , we need to first solve eq.([eq : x1 ] ) and then evaluate the eigenvalue correction in eq.([eq : lam2 ] ) .",

    "the other special case is that of maximal driving , @xmath151 ( one necessarily also has @xmath89 ) , for which all cumulants ( including the 1st and the 2nd ) are exactly zero because both reservoirs simultaneously try to only inject particles at both ends ( an equivalent situation arises also for @xmath152 ) .",
