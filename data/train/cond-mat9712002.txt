    "[ introduction ] in two previous papers on quantum kinetic theory , which we shall call qki @xcite and qkii @xcite in this paper , we focussed on the theory of a bose gas in which there was    * no more than a small amount of bose condensate , so that the interactions between the particles were not sufficiently strong to produce a significant modification to the excitation spectrum of the bose gas ; * no trapping potential , so that the system was spatially homogeneous .",
    "such a treatment gives insight into the the statistical aspects of quantum kinetics , but can not be applied to the condensates presently being produced @xcite , in which there is very strong condensation of an alkali metal vapor in a rather tight trap .    in this work",
    "the focus will be on strongly condensed trapped systems , with a methodology based on that of qki , but somewhat simplified in order to exhibit the major features of the interaction of a bose - condensate with a vapor of non - condensed particles .",
    "the basis of our method is to divide the condensate spectrum into two bands ; the _ condensate band _ , in which the presence of the condensate significantly modifies the excitation spectrum , and the _ non - condensate band _ , whose energy levels are sufficiently high for the interaction with the condensate to be negligible .    in fig.1(a )",
    "we depict the kind of trap for which this division is very clear  a rather wide trap , in the center of which is a small tight trap , with a few energy levels .",
    "in contrast , in fig.1(b ) we depict a harmonic trap , in which the division is not so obvious .",
    "in fact , however , the three dimensional nature of the trap , in which the density of states increases quadratically with energy , also yields a relatively small number of isolated levels at low energies , which rapidly approaches a continuum , so the dramatic difference between the two traps is more apparent than real .",
    "current experiments all use harmonic traps , but the `` ideal '' trap of fig.1(b ) would in principle be better adapted to studies of the condensate itself .",
    "the dynamics of the non - condensate band is thus well described by the kind of formalism used in qki , with modifications to take account of the fact that we have also introduced a trapping potential @xmath0 . on the other hand , the dynamics of the condensate band",
    "is well described by the energy spectrum which arises from bogoliubov s method @xcite , as adapted to apply to the case of particles in a trap @xcite .",
    "this kind of dynamics has been well studied by many workers in the past two years @xcite , and the equation of motion for the condensate wavefunction is now generally verified both theoretically and experimentally to be the time - dependent gross - pitaveskii equation @xcite .    the aim of this paper is to develop and use methods to describe the interaction between the condensate band and the non - condensate band .",
    "the results of our investigations can be summarized as follows :    * the _ non - condensate band _ is taken to be fully thermalized , in the sense that at any point @xmath1 in phase space there is a local particle phase - space density @xmath2 , and the space time correlation functions of this phase space density have a weakly damped classical form . *",
    "the dynamics of the condensate band , in interaction with the thermalized non - condensate band , is given by a master equation ( [ ii4.11a][ii4.11 g ] ) , in which the interaction terms are of three kinds : * * two particles in the non - condensate band collide , and after the collision , one of these particle remains within the condensate band ; and there is also of course the corresponding time - reversed process .",
    "* * a particle in the non - condensate band collides with a particle in the condensate band , and exchanges energy with it , but does not enter the condensate band . * * a particle in the non - condensate band collides with one in the condensate band , and after the collision both particles are left in the condensate band ; and again there is also of course the corresponding time - reversed process . * by using the particle - number - conserving bogoliubov method @xcite developed by one of us , the expressions which arise in the master equation can be re - written in a form in which the processes are described in terms of * * creation and destruction of particles ; thus if @xmath3 is the total number of particles in the condensate band , we introduce operators @xmath4 which change @xmath3 by @xmath5 . * * creation and destruction of quasiparticles , which are to be regarded as quantized oscillations of the whole body of @xmath3 particles in the condensate band . +",
    "thus there is a clear distinction made between creation and destruction of _ particles _ @xmath6 , and the creation and destruction of _ quasiparticles _ , which are mere excitations , and not particles .",
    "this distinction follows from the particle number conserving bogoliubov method @xcite , and has not been made clear in nearly all earlier treatments of bogoliubov s method , which blur this distinction , and give the misleading impression that the bogoliubov excitation spectrum can only be obtained if strict conservation of particle number is abandoned .",
    "we emphasize here that the particle number conserving bogoliubov method gives exactly the same results for the excitation spectrum as the usual version ; however , because particle number conservation is maintained , it is possible to specify both wavefunctions and energy eigenvalues for states with a definite energy and a definite number of particles . *",
    "it is possible to split off the largest terms in the master equation , and approximate the description by a single basic master equation for @xmath3 , the number of particles in the condensate band , and thus arrive at a description of the growth of a condensate from the vapor .",
    "the very simplest version of this description , in which all fluctuations are neglected , takes the form of a single differential equation @xmath7/k_{b}t}\\right)n+1\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath8 is a certain kinetic coefficient , for which we can give an approximate form , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are respectively the vapor chemical potential and the chemical potential of the condensate wavefunction for @xmath11 particles , as given by solving the time - independent gross - pitaevskii equation . *",
    "detailed descriptions of the dynamics of fluctuations can be given .",
    "the stationary solution for the condensate density operator is a _ mixture _ ( _ not _ a quantum - mechanical superposition ) of states with different numbers @xmath3 of particles . for each such state ,",
    "the wavefunction of the condensate is @xmath12 , the solution of the the time - independent gross - pitaevskii equation for @xmath3 particles . * a description of both phase diffusion of the condensate and of the decay of excitations",
    "can also be given , and these will appear in a subsequent paper . @xcite .    the description given in this paper is a simplified one , in which the non - condensate band is treated as stationary , so that it does constitute a genuine `` heat - bath '' , characterized by a fixed temperature @xmath13 and a fixed chemical potential @xmath9 .",
    "this is not an essential feature of the basic quantum kinetic description , which , in its full form , treats the two bands as having their own dynamics as well as being coupled together .",
    "the full quantum kinetic theory will be presented in a subsequent paper , qkv .",
    "it turns out to be a rather intricate process to derive such a description , even though the essential result , as used in this paper , is that the non - condensate band is described by an equation of the uehling - uhlenbeck form @xcite , with correlation functions of a thermal form .",
    "[ desc ]      as in qki , we consider a set of spin-0 bose particles , described by the hamiltonian @xmath14 in which @xmath15 and @xmath16 the potential function @xmath17 is a c - number and is as usual not the true interatomic potential , but rather a short range potential  approximately a delta function  which reproduces the correct scattering length .",
    "this enables the born approximation to be applied , and thus simplifies the mathematics considerably .",
    "@xcite    the term @xmath18 arises from a trapping potential , and is written as @xmath19 thus , this is the standard second quantized theory of an interacting bose gas of particles with mass @xmath20 .      when there is strong condensation in a trap , the lowest energy level of the trap develops a macroscopic occupation , and modifies the other energy levels in the trap .",
    "if the trap is quite tight , the lower energy levels are reasonably well separated , as is indeed experimentally the case @xcite .",
    "the concept of a `` tight '' trap is however not absolute ; a trap may be tight for the lower energy levels , but quite broad for the higher energy levels .",
    "the essential distinction is the density of states , which increases like @xmath21 for a harmonic trap , leading to very closely spaced levels for quite moderate energy .",
    "in addition , one must also note that the modification of the energy levels induced by the condensate affects only the lower levels significantly .",
    "the procedure which follows from these is to divide the particle states into a _ condensate band _ @xmath22 and _ non condensate band _ @xmath23 , and to perform a corresponding resolution of the field operator in the form @xmath24 .",
    "the separation between the two bands is in terms of energy ; we choose to define the division in such a way that the energies of all particles in @xmath23 are sufficiently large that there is essentially no effect on them by the presence of the condensate in the lowest energy levels .",
    "we will describe @xmath22 in terms of discrete trap energy levels , while @xmath23 will be taken as being essentially thermalized , with correlation function given by the usual equilibrium formulae .",
    "we can now write the full hamiltonian in a form which separates the three components ; namely , those which act within @xmath23 only , those which act within @xmath25 only , and those which cause transfers of energy or population between @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "thus we write @xmath26 in which @xmath27 is the part of @xmath28 which depends only on @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the part which depends only on @xmath31 , and that part of the interaction hamiltonian which involves both condensate band and non - condensate band operators is called @xmath32 , and can be written @xmath33 where the individual terms in @xmath32 are the terms involving operators from both bands , which cause transfer of energy and/or particles between @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we call the parts involving one @xmath31 operator @xmath34 the parts involving two @xmath35 operators are called @xmath36 the parts involving three @xmath35 operators are called @xmath37",
    "using the separation into condensate band and non - condensate band operators we can now proceed to develop a master equation . we have developed a full quantum kinetic description , in which the atoms in @xmath23 are treated by a wavelet method as in qki , and the atoms in @xmath22 in terms of the wavefunctions corresponding to the energy levels of the trap , modified by the presence of a condensate in the lowest level .",
    "this leads to a description which is very comprehensive , but one whose complexity would obscure the essential aspects of condensate dynamics which are the subject of this paper .",
    "this description will be published separately .",
    "the present description will assume that @xmath23 is fully thermalized , and thus the atoms in these levels will be treated simply as a heat bath and source of atoms for the levels in @xmath22 , which provide a description of the dynamics of the condensate treated as an open system .",
    "the simplest assumption is that @xmath38 has a thermodynamic equilibrium form given by @xmath39 this gives rise to relatively simple equations for the kinetics of the condensate under the restriction that the density operator for the non - condensed atoms is clamped in this form .",
    "a more practical thermalization requirement is that of _ local _ thermalization .",
    "this is defined by requiring the field operator correlation functions to have a thermal form locally , and to have factorization properties like those which pertain in equilibrium .",
    "time - dependence of @xmath40 can be included as well , as long as this happens on a much slower time scale than than those which arise from the master equation which we derive . the precise nature of these local equilibrium requirements will be specified in sect.[correlation ]      the derivation of the master equation follows a rather standard methodology .",
    "we project out the dependence on the non - condensate band by defining the condensate density operator as @xmath41 and a projector @xmath42 by @xmath43 and we also use the notation @xmath44    the equation of motion for the full density operator @xmath45 is the von neumann equation @xmath46 \\\\ & \\equiv &   ( { \\cal l}_{nc}+{\\cal l}_{0}+{\\cal l}_{i , c } ) \\rho .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we use the laplace transform notation for any function @xmath47 @xmath48 we then use standard methods to write the master equation for @xmath49 as @xmath50^{-1 } { \\cal q}{\\cal l}_{i , c}\\tilde v(s).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this form the master equation is basically exact .",
    "we shall make the approximation that the kernel of the second part , the @xmath51^{-1}$ ] term , can be approximated by keeping only the terms which describe the basic hamiltonians within @xmath22 or @xmath23 , namely the terms @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "we then invert the laplace transform , and make a markov approximation to get @xmath54 there are now a number of different terms to consider .",
    "these arise from the term @xmath55 , and lead to a hamiltonian term of the form @xmath56 the terms involving the @xmath31 operators represent essentially two effects .",
    "the first is the effect of the mean density of the condensate band on the energy levels of the non - condensate band . by definition of the non - condensate band ,",
    "this effect is negligible .",
    "they also represent an effect of the average non - condensate density on the condensate .",
    "this is also small , but can be included explicitly in our formulation of the master equation .    in ( [ h11 ] )",
    "one can see clearly the `` hartree '' term in the second line , and the `` fock '' term in the third line .",
    "however in the remainder of this paper we shall use the delta function form of the interaction potential @xmath57 , and the difference between these terms and the second and third lines of ( [ hic2 ] ) disappears .",
    "none of our results will depend heavily on the validity of this approximation , but the formulae do become considerably more compact .",
    "we now examine the term involving @xmath58 as defined in ( [ hic1 ] ) , which contain one @xmath59 or @xmath60 ; explicitly , the term in hamiltonian can be written @xmath61 in this equation we have defined a notation @xmath62 substituting into the master equation ( [ met ] ) , terms arise which are of the form @xmath63 here we have used the notation @xmath64    we can now transform the term involving the @xmath31 s into something more tractable , though perhaps more abstract , by expanding in eigenoperators of the commutator @xmath65 $ ] : thus we write @xmath66 where the operators @xmath67 are eigenoperators of @xmath30 @xmath68 = - \\hbar \\epsilon_m x_m({\\bf x}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath69 may be positive or negative , but @xmath70 is a label which uniquely specifies the eigenvalue @xmath69 .",
    "the quantities @xmath69 give the possible frequencies corresponding to transitions between condensate energy levels , and will be called the _",
    "transition frequencies_.      to compute the transition operators @xmath71 , one needs to know all of the eigenstates of @xmath30 .",
    "thus , if these eigenstates are called @xmath72 , with eigenvalue @xmath73 , then @xmath74 this expression is of a formal nature , since the full calculation of the energy eigenstates and the matrix elements of the field operator is a formidable task .",
    "however , by using the modified bogoliubov method of @xcite , this can be made into a tractable task , as will be explained in sect.[bog ] .",
    "[ rwa rpa ] because the two operators @xmath31 and @xmath75 both turn up , there will be a double summation @xmath76 . to get a master equation",
    "it is necessary to ensure that only the @xmath77 terms exist .",
    "this is normally achieved in quantum optical situations via the _ rotating wave approximation _",
    ", which effectively eliminates the unwanted @xmath78 terms on the grounds that they are rapidly oscillating , unlike the @xmath77 terms .",
    "perhaps more compelling in the situation here is the fact that the diagonal ( non - rotating ) terms have a consistent sign , while the off - diagonal terms  of whiche there are very many  do not , and will thus tend to cancel .",
    "this is effectively a _",
    "random phase approximation_. hence we will keep only the diagonal @xmath77 terms in what follows .",
    "the terms involving @xmath79 are averaged over @xmath38 , which is quantum gaussian , but is modified by the presence of the interaction .",
    "a full treatment of these correlation functions requires the quantum kinetic theory of the non - condensate band , and this will be done in @xcite .",
    "however this treatment is quite intricate , and yields a result which , in the approximation that the non - condensate is regarded as a thermal undepleted bath , is really quite standard and well - accepted .",
    "this takes the form    * we may make the replacement @xmath80 ( terms involving @xmath81 etc .",
    "do arise in principle , but give no contribution to the final result because of energy conservation considerations . )",
    "* the time - dependence is needed only for small @xmath82 , and in this case we can make an appropriate replacements in terms of the one - particle wigner function @xmath83 @xmath84 e^{i{\\bf k}\\cdot{\\bf v } } e^{-i\\omega({\\bf k},{\\bf u})\\tau } \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 since the range of all the @xmath86 integrals is restricted to @xmath23 , it is implicit that in all integrals that @xmath87 . * this approximation is valid in the situation where @xmath88 is a smooth function of its arguments , and can be regarded as a local equilibrium assumption for particles moving in a potential which is comparatively slowly varying in space .",
    "using these factorizations , the term ( [ bba8 ] ) becomes @xmath89 in which @xmath90\\left[f({\\bf k}_2,{\\bf u})+1\\right ] f({\\bf k}_3,{\\bf u } ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times e^{i({\\bf k}_1+{\\bf k}_2-{\\bf k}_3)\\cdot{\\bf v } } \\delta^p(\\omega_1+\\omega_2-\\omega_3-\\omega ) \\\\ { \\label{rimag } } & \\equiv &   g^{(-)}\\left({\\bf u}+{{\\bf v}\\over2},{\\bf u}-{{\\bf v}\\over2},\\omega\\right ) -i",

    "[ 2 phi ] of these terms , only those involving on @xmath31 and one @xmath75 can yield a resonant term , corresponding to scattering of a non - condensate particle by the condensate .",
    "the effect of the non - resonant terms would be a shifting of the energy levels of @xmath23 , and by definition of the non - condensate band , this is negligible .",
    "thus we arrive at an approximation to @xmath92 in the form of a term @xmath93 where @xmath94 the term analogous to ( [ bba8 ] ) in the master equation becomes @xmath95 we can write now @xmath96 where @xmath97 represents the frequency associated with @xmath98 . inserting these into ( [ bba14 ] )",

    "however in order to use it in practice , it would be necessary to compute the full spectrum and eigenstates of the condensate , and for this it is necessary to have some approximate treatment of the condensate .",

    "this treatment can be summarized as follows for the situation here , where we wish to use it for the condensate band , which will involve in principle some adaptation to take account of the fact that @xmath59 is expanded in basis functions which belong to @xmath114 .",

    "the major effect is caused by the fact that the commutator of the condensate band field operators is not a delta function , but takes the form @xmath115&= & g({\\bf x},{\\bf x}')\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath116 is the restriction of the delta function to the condensate band .",
    "this is independent of the amount of condensate , since the boundary between the condensate and non - condensate bands is defined in terms of the unperturbed eigenstates .",

    "the essence of the method is first to find an approximation to @xmath59 which is valid when @xmath59 acts on a highly condensed state , in which most of the particles are in the state represented by the wavefunction @xmath118 .",
    "such a highly condensed state is written @xmath121 , where @xmath122 represents the vector of occupation numbers of the non - condensed modes within the condensate band .",
    "if @xmath123 , the state can be rewritten in a form which uses _ the total number of particles @xmath3 _ rather than @xmath124 and we will call this @xmath125 .",

    "the inverse of ( [ tb4 ] ) is also approximately given by @xmath128 and the field operator is then approximated by @xmath129 ( the corresponding formulae in @xcite use @xmath130 , rather than @xmath131 , which is what appears most naturally in the computations .",
    "the difference is of order @xmath132 , which is better than the accuracy of the expansion , but the @xmath133 form gives much more elegant formulae because of the cancellation with other terms  hence its use here . )",
    "finally we can show that the _ phonon _ operators @xmath134 , and the operator @xmath135 behave approximately like a set of independent annihilation operators ; i.e. , @xmath136 \\approx \\delta_{k , k'}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is then found that if @xmath12 represents the ground state wavefunction , the following are true .",
    "the ground state wavefunction @xmath12 must be a solution of the time - independent gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath137 in fact , because of the modified commutator ( [ phi commutator ] ) , the precise equation is given by the projection of the right hand side of ( [ tb10 ] ) onto the condensate band being equal to the left hand side , but there will be very little practical difference introduced by this modification .",
    "it is , roughly speaking , equivalent to solving the partial differential equation on a grid of spacing similar to the lowest wavelength in the non - condensate band .",
    "this is in fact what is done in any practical procedure ",
    "the only modification is that we now specify that the grid not be finer than required by the restriction to the condensate band .",
    "the procedure can be put in the form of an expansion in inverse powers of @xmath138 by formalizing the requirement that the number of particles @xmath3 be large and the interaction strength @xmath139 be small . to do this one sets @xmath140 and then develops the approximation procedure as an asymptotic expansion at fixed @xmath141 in inverse powers of @xmath138 . using this procedure",

    "however an extension of the methodology to deal with small numbers of particles in the condensate would be straightforward , and requires us simply to express the field operators in terms of particle creation and destruction operators , and rewrite ( [ ii4.11a][ii4.11f ] ) appropriately .",

    "the simplifications and approximations made in this paper can be summarized as follows :    * in going from ( [ h9 ] ) to ( [ met ] ) we have neglected the interaction between the condensate and the non - condensate bands in the kernel .",
    "this means that we assume that the condensate band has a spectrum which is not greatly changed by this interaction . for condensates presently being studied , this is certainly experimentally valid for the lowest levels , since their behaviour is well described by the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "however , to give a quantitative criterion for the validity of this approximation seems at this stage to be too ambitious .",
    "* after the previous approximation , a markov approximation is made .",
    "this amounts to requiring that the irreversible processes arising from the master equation are much slower than the reversible processes described by the separate evolution operators of the condensate and non - condensate bands . for the non - condensate band ,",
    "the arguments for its validity are the same as those in qki , while for the condensate band , the evidence is experimental , that the damping measured is definitely weak compared to the timescale of oscillations , which can only be the consequence of the condensate band hamiltonian @xmath30 . *",
    "another major approximation is the rotating wave or random phase approximation .",
    "again , it is difficult to give a quantitative measure of its validity , other than to say that it should be valid when the basic behavior of the noncondensed vapor should be describable as transitions between states which are well described by single particle energy levels .",
    "all the exprimental evidence , including the very design of the experiments , seems to verify this .",
    "the basic premise of the random phase approximation is that the non - resonant terms are all of random signs , and effectively change sign frequently within times of interest , and it seems to us that the arguments for the validity of the random phase approximation are as good here as in similar situations in solid state physics .",
    "however , one can only make a definite statement by comparison with experiment .",
    "the question of validity can also be looked at from another point of view ; namely , there will be traps , of the type illustrated in fig.1(a ) , in which the separation between the dynamics of the condensate and non - condensate band is as good as one wishes , and for which the approximations employed will certainly be valid .",
    "even so , we believe that it is very likely that our approximations are already good for the harmonic traps currently in use , but ultimately it seems to us that other kinds of trap may be both more useful , and more adapted to our kind of description .      apart from the work of anglin @xcite , previous work on the field of condensate growth @xcite has focussed on the growth of a condensate in a spatially homogeneous system , or an approximately spatially homogeneous system , rather than in a trapped system , and thus has not been applicable to the condensates presently being produced .",
    "the major difference in point of view in this paper is the description of the condensate in terms of the trap energy levels for a given number of particles , which is treated here by the modified bogoliubov method , and the clear division into the condensate and non - condensate bands .",
    "it is these two innovations which make our treatment of condensate growth possible .",
    "our simplified master equation ( [ simp1 ] ) bears a very strong resemblance to that of anglin @xcite , who presented a model calculation based on a single level in a very tight potential well , centered inside a spherically symmetric bath of atoms moving essentially freely , apart from collisions .",
    "anglin s model can be viewed as the description of the most ideal trap imaginble , in which the small trap permits only one energy level , and the larger trap is actually almost infinite .",
    "it is thus drastically simplified from the beginning , unlike ours , which treats all relevant features as exactly as possible .",
    "the term in anglin s model which gives pure phase diffusion is not present in ( [ simp1 ] ) , but clearly arises from similar approximations applied to the term ( [ comp9 ] ) . indeed",
    "if one takes the diagonal matrix elements of anglin s master equation , one obtains an equation of the form ( [ prac2 ] ) in which @xmath323 and @xmath324 are related to each other by ( [ simp6 ] ) , and the absolute value of @xmath323 is given by multiplying our value ( [ prac1 ] ) ( apart from the final term in curly brackets ) by a factor of order of magnitude @xmath325 , where @xmath326 is the binding energy of anglin s potential as defined in his paper .",
    "the major assumption behind anglin s derivation of the markov approximation is that @xmath327 is small .",
    "this requires that @xmath9 be negative , and that @xmath328 .",
    "thus the physical situation is rather different from what we consider  the vapor of uncondensed atoms is always essentially classical , and the condensation only occurs because of the depth of the attractive potential .",
    "the collisions which establish the condensate are of the same kind as ours , but in anglin s case a typical collision must yield one final atom in the condensate , whose negative energy @xmath329 must be balanced by transferring the equivalent amount to the other atom , which must also take up all the momentum of the initial two vapor particles  this will involve typically particles with energy @xmath330 . if @xmath331 this will be a rather small fraction of the total number of particles , and hence the extra factor @xmath325 seems quite understandable .    thus we conclude that anglin s model is consistent with our analysis .",
    "our picture does appear to be at variance with the description of the condensate in terms of `` broken gauge symmetry''or `` bose broken symmetry '' , which has been customary for many years @xcite .",
    "it appears to us that these concepts are in fact not helpful in the description of the condensates which are produced in current experiments , and indeed we doubt whether they have any relevance to the physics .",
    "the stationary states of the system are indeed in our formulation simple statistical mixtures of number states of @xmath11 , the total number of particles in the condensate band .",
    "the correlation functions @xmath332 however do exhibit the mandatory property of `` off diagonal long range order '' , even though the stationary averages @xmath333 , @xmath334 are zero .",
    "this happens in laser theory as well , where the existence of a well defined phase of the optical field is the result of a rather long phase diffusion time compared with the other relaxation times  we will demonstrate the analogous property for the bose condensate in @xcite , though the essential points have already been foreshadowed by several authors @xcite , who have shown how the measurement of the relative phase between two condensates introduces a relative coherence between the two condensates , which remains in existence on the time scale of phase diffusion . in a ferromagnet",
    "the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking acquires its validity from the extremely long diffusion time for the magnetic moment of a sample of the ferromagnet  over a sufficiently long time the average magnetic moment would be zero , but this time is much longer than the lifetime of the average experimenter , who therefore does not see things this way . in the end",
    "it is a matter of taste where we draw the line between dephasing time which is very long and one which is essentially infinite  it depends on the relevant timescales of the experiment , including ultimately the timescale of the patience of the experimenter .",
    "we would like to acknowledge discussions with r. j. ballagh , m. j. davis , j. i. cirac , d. jaksch , j. anglin and g. shlyapnikov .",
    "this work was supported by the marsden fund under contract number pvt-603 , and by sterreichische fonds zur frderung der wissenschaftlichen forschung .",
    "in this appendix we will use the bogoliubov method as described in sect.[bog ] to get an estimate of the energy @xmath242 above which we may neglect the effect of the condensate on the trap energy levels .",
    "we use the thomas - fermi approximation to the condensate wavefunction in which we neglect the laplacian term in the time independent gross - pitaevskii equation , giving the approximate solution @xmath335 for a harmonic potential @xmath336 normalization requires @xmath337 where @xmath338      use the definition ( [ t5c ] ) of @xmath147 , and substitute ( [ tf1 ] ) to get @xmath339 with @xmath340 we can then write @xmath341 where @xmath342 @xmath343 are the energy levels of @xmath344 , and @xmath345 are the corresponding eigenfunctions , which have been chosen as real .      for high lying excitations , we expect that the smooth nature of the ground state wavefunction will mean that essentially @xmath346 , so that the individual modes are diagonalized by a _ squeezing transformation _",
    "@xmath347 with , for small @xmath348 , @xmath349 to estimate @xmath350 , we approximate the wavefunction @xmath351 by a wkb approximation to an appropriate three dimensional harmonic oscillator wavefunction ( obtained by neglecting the flattening in the potential caused by the condensate , but not the chemical potential shift ) ; this means we can approximate by smoothing over the oscillations , and then neglecting the @xmath224 dependence , to get @xmath352 with @xmath353^{-1/2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with similar equations for the other terms .",
    "this means that ( letting @xmath354 , @xmath355      for the case of the top trap of jila using rubidium , we find that the ratio @xmath356 can be chosen to be less than about 0.03 for all @xmath357 on a fixed energy surface provided @xmath358 is more than about 2.4 at @xmath359 rising to 3.4 when @xmath360 .",
    "[ evaluations ] we want to calculate @xmath361 |\\tilde\\xi({\\bf k } ) |^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we assume    * that we can use the maxwell - boltzmann form @xmath362 * that @xmath363 is negligible compared to 1 in the region of interest . *",
    "that the range of @xmath364 in which @xmath365 is non - negligible is very small .",
    "this means we can drop all the remaining @xmath366-dependence , and integrate @xmath365 to give 1 .",
    "we then carry out the @xmath367 integration to get @xmath368/ \\hbar\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\&&\\times \\exp\\left(2\\mu -{\\hbar^2}\\left({\\bf k}_1 ^ 2+{\\bf k}_2 ^ 2\\right)/2m\\over k_{b}t \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this point no further approximations need to be made . by changing variable to @xmath369 ,",
    "@xmath370 the integral becomes spherically symmetric in both of the variables , and the @xmath371 integral can be carried out using the delta function , and the integral finally reduced to @xmath372 using @xcite , formula 13.2.5 , the integral can be reduced to a form involving the confluent hypergeometric function @xmath373 , which itself by formula 13.6.21 can be reduced to an expression involving the modified bessel function @xmath240 , which gives the final result @xmath374 as in ( [ prac1 ] ) .    and p. zoller phys",
