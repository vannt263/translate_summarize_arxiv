    "electromagnetic production of mesons on the nucleon offers a great opportunity to deepen our understanding of the baryon resonances properties . in recent years",
    ", intensive experimental efforts have been devoted to the measurement of observables for the processes of pseudoscalar and vector mesons production , using electron and/or photon beam facilities .    in the present work",
    "we investigate the reaction @xmath2 , in the range of centre - of - mass total energy from threshold up to @xmath10 2 gev , in order to interpret a large amount of high quality data released from various facilities , namely , differential cross - section data by the following collaborations : mami  @xcite , clas  @xcite , cb - elsa  @xcite , lns - gev-@xmath11  @xcite and graal  @xcite , polarized beam asymmetries by cb - elsa / taps  @xcite and graal  @xcite .",
    "the copious set of data has motivated extensive theoretical investigations .",
    "most of the available models are based on meson - nucleon degrees of freedom , in which the feynman diagrammatic techniques are used , so that the transition amplitudes are lorentz invariant . in recent years various advanced approaches",
    "have been developed , namely , the unitary isobar model of maid  @xcite , geissen  @xcite and bonn - gatchina groups  @xcite coupled - channel approaches , as well as the partial wave analysis of said  @xcite .",
    "those approaches have no explicit connection with qcd , and the number of parameters in the models increases with the number of resonances included in the models .",
    "formalisms embodying the subnucleonic degrees of freedom are also being developed .",
    "such a program has its genesis in the early works by copley , karl and obryk  @xcite and feynman , kisslinger and ravndal  @xcite in the pion photoproduction , who provided the first clear evidence of the underlying @xmath12 structure of the baryon spectrum .",
    "the subsequent works  @xcite in the framework of the constituent quark models concentrated mainly on the transition amplitudes and the baryon mass spectrum , predicting still undiscovered or `` missing '' , resonances .",
    "however , those approaches did not investigate reaction mechanisms .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a comprehensive and unified approach to the pseudoscalar mesons photoproduction , based on the low energy qcd lagrangian  @xcite , is developed with the explicit quark degrees of freedom .",
    "this approach reduces drastically the number of free parameters , for example , within the exact @xmath1 symmetry , the reaction under investigation has only one free parameter , namely , @xmath13 coupling constant .",
    "however , that symmetry is broken and in order to take into account that effect , one free parameter per resonance was introduced in previous calculations  @xcite . given that the configuration mixing among the 3-constituent quarks bound states is a consequence of the @xmath1 symmetry breakdown , in the present work we use the one - gluon - exchange mechanism to generate the configuration mixing of the wave functions . in this approach ,",
    "the number of parameters decreases significantly .",
    "after the parameters are determined by fitting the data , we then study the contributions from the missing resonances ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) . besides , we give relations connecting the scattering amplitudes in our @xmath0qm approach to the photoexcitation helicity amplitudes and partial decay widths of resonances .",
    "our approach offers also the opportunity of investigating new nucleon resonances , for which strong indications have been reported in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : theo ] , the theoretical content of our work is presented . starting from a chiral effective lagrangian ,",
    "the cgln amplitudes for the process @xmath2 are given within the @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "then the consequences of the breaking of that symmetry _ via _ configuration mixing in one - gluon - exchange ( oge ) model is reported and helicity amplitudes of photon transition and meson decay partial widths of resonances are presented . the fitting procedure and numerical results for differential cross - section , polarized beam asymmetry , helicity amplitudes , and @xmath14 partial decay width are reported and discussed in section  [ sec : res ] , where possible roles played by new / missing resonances are examined .",
    "summary and conclusions are given in section  [ sec : conclu ] .",
    "in this section we recall the content of a chiral constituent quark approach and relate it to the configuration mixing of constituent quarks states _ via _ a oge model , generated by the breakdown of the @xmath1 symmetry . then we present issues related to the photoexcitation helicity amplitudes and the partial decay widths of nucleon resonances .      as in ref .",
    "@xcite we start from an effective chiral lagrangian  @xcite , @xmath15\\psi + \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where vector ( @xmath16 ) and axial ( @xmath17 ) currents read , @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 the meson decay constant .",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are the quark and meson fields , respectively .",
    "there are four components for the photoproduction of pseudoscalar mesons based on the qcd lagrangian , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the initial ( final ) state of the nucleon , and @xmath25 represents the energy of incoming ( outgoing ) photons ( mesons ) . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mfi ] ) is a seagull term .",
    "it is generated by the gauge transformation of the axial vector @xmath26 in the qcd lagrangian .",
    "this term , being proportional to the electric charge of the outgoing mesons , does not contribute to the production of the @xmath27-meson .",
    "the second and third terms correspond to the _",
    "s- _ and _ u-_channels , respectively .",
    "the last term is the _",
    "t-_channel contribution .",
    "in this paper we focus on the nucleon resonance contributions . given that the _ u-_channel contributions are less sensitive to the details of resonances structure than those in the _",
    "s-_-channel , it is then reasonable to treat the _",
    "u-_channel components as degenerate  @xcite .    for _ s-_channel ,",
    "the amplitudes are given by the following expression  @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the total centre - of - mass energy of the system , and @xmath30 is determined by the structure of each resonance .",
    "@xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ 42 ] ) is the total width of the resonance , and a function of the final state momentum @xmath32 .",
    "the transition amplitude for the @xmath33 harmonic - oscillator shell is @xmath34 the first ( second ) term represents the process in which the incoming photon and outgoing meson , are absorbed and emitted by the same(different ) quark .    in the present work ,",
    "we use the standard multipole expansion of the cgln amplitudes  @xcite , and obtain the partial wave amplitudes of resonance @xmath35 .",
    "then , the transition amplitude takes the following form : @xmath36 expressing the cgln amplitudes in their usual formulation  @xcite , leads to the hebb - walker amplitudes in terms of photoexcitation helicity amplitudes , @xmath37 where @xmath38^{1/2}\\frac{2m_{n^*}}{s - m_{n^*}^2+im_{n^*}\\gamma({{\\mbox { \\boldmath}}q})}a^m_{1/2}\\equiv f_0\\frac{2m_{n^*}}{s - m_{n^*}^2+im_{n^*}\\gamma({{\\mbox { \\boldmath}}q})},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath39 the @xmath40 decay amplitude , appearing in the partial decay width , @xmath41 where @xmath42 represents the clebsch - gordan coefficients related to the isospin coupling in the outgoing channel .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the partial decay amplitudes are used to separate the contribution of the state with the same orbital angular momentum @xmath43 .",
    "in fact , with the helicity amplitudes of photon transition and meson decay we can directly obtain the cgln amplitudes for each resonances in terms of legendre polynomials derivatives : @xmath44p'_{\\ell\\pm1},\\nonumber\\\\ f_{2l\\pm}&=&f_0 [ \\mp a^{n^*}_{1/2}-\\sqrt{\\frac{l+ 1/2\\pm 3/2}{l+ 1/2 \\mp\\ 1/2 } } a^{n^*}_{3/2}]p'_{\\ell},\\nonumber\\\\ f_{3l\\pm}&=&\\pm f_0\\frac{2a^{n^*}_{3/2}}{\\sqrt{(l- 1/2 \\pm 1/2)(l+ 3/2 \\pm 1/2 ) } } p''_{\\ell\\pm1},\\nonumber\\\\ f_{4l\\pm}&=&\\mp f_0\\frac{2a^{n^*}_{3/2}}{\\sqrt{(l- 1/2 \\pm 1/2)(l+ 3/2 \\pm\\ 1/2)}}p''_{\\ell}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] all @xmath45s are proportional to the meson decay amplitudes .",
    "so they can be used to separate the contributions from the state with the same @xmath46 and @xmath43 as presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in our approach , the photoexcitation helicity amplitudes @xmath47 and @xmath48 , as well as the decay amplitudes ,",
    "are related to the matrix elements of the electromagnetic interaction hamiltonian  @xcite , @xmath49      the amplitudes in sec.[sec : qm ] are derived under the @xmath1 symmetry . however , for physical states that symmetry is broken .",
    "an example is the violation of the moorhouse rule  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a set of parameters @xmath50 were hence introduced to take into account the breaking of that symmetry , _ via _ following substitution : @xmath51 in refs .",
    "@xcite , those parameters were allowed to vary around their @xmath1 values ( @xmath52 = 0 or 1 ) . in this work , instead of using those adjustable parameters , we introduce the breakdown of that symmetry through the configuration mixings of baryons wave functions .    to achieve such an improvement , we must choose a potential model .",
    "the popular used ones are one - gluon - exchange ( oge ) model  @xcite and goldstone boson exchange model  @xcite . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , these two models give similar mixing angles for the negative parity resonances and the relevant observables . here",
    ", we adopt the oge model which has been successfully used to study the helicity amplitudes and decay widths  @xcite of resonances .    in oge model",
    ", the hamiltonian of system can be written as  @xcite , @xmath53 where the @xmath54 is the `` constituent '' effective masse of quark @xmath55 and @xmath56 the separation between two quarks .",
    "the confinement potential has two components ; one written as a harmonic oscillator potential ( @xmath57 , with @xmath58 the spring constant ) , and an unspecified anharmonicity @xmath59 , treated as a perturbation .",
    "the hyperfine part interaction is the sum of contact and tensor terms , @xmath60 here , @xmath61 is the spin of quark @xmath55 , and @xmath62 a normalization factor , treated as free parameter  @xcite .",
    "the hyperfine interaction generates the configuration mixings among the ground - state @xmath63 ( @xmath64 $ ] ) and other configurations , e.g. @xmath65 ( @xmath66 $ ] ) , @xmath67 ( @xmath68 $ ] ) , and @xmath69 ( @xmath70 $ ] ) . here , the notation is @xmath71 , where @xmath72 , @xmath73 the total quark spin , @xmath43 @xmath74",
    "@xmath73 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 the total orbital angular momentum , and @xmath77 ,  @xmath78 or @xmath79 the permutational symmetry ( symmetric , mixed symmetry , or antisymmetric , respectively ) of spatial wave function .",
    "the first two terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) can be rewritten as two harmonic oscillators within the jocabi coordinate .",
    "its solution is the well known @xmath1 wave functions .",
    "the breakdown of the symmetry arises from the additional terms .",
    "given that the configuration mixing is mainly produced by the spin- and flavor - dependent parts of hamiltonian  @xcite , here we use a simple method to deal with the confinement terms in refs .",
    "@xcite , where three constants @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 are introduced .    in order to illustrate the modifications of the scattering amplitudes due to the @xmath1 symmetry breakdown , we give in the following the explicit derivations in the case of the @xmath3 resonance . in lines with ref .",
    "@xcite , we express the amplitudes @xmath83 in terms of the product of the photoexcitation and meson - decay transition amplitudes , @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the meson and photon transition operators , respectively . the wave function can be written within the @xmath1 symmetry for @xmath87 shells as @xmath88 and configuration mixings , with @xmath89 the state s total angular momentum and parity , @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 can be determined by the oge model .",
    "if we set @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( so @xmath95 ) , then , the @xmath1 symmetry is restored .",
    "the improvement compared to ref .",
    "@xcite is that here we not only take into account the mixing in the intermediate @xmath8 resonance but also in the initial- and final - state nucleon .",
    "moreover , for other resonances , we also include directly the configuration mixing of wave functions _ via _ oge model , so that we do not need to introduce the free parameters @xmath50 ( eq .  ( [ eq : ar ] ) ) .",
    "the electromagnetic transition amplitudes then take the following form : @xmath96 here , the term @xmath97 vanishes because of the moorhouse rule  @xcite . in ref",
    "@xcite , the mixing angles are introduced also to give a nonzero value for contributions from the @xmath98 resonance , but the nucleon wave function includes only the @xmath99 part , that is , @xmath93 , @xmath100 .",
    "moreover , the contribution of the @xmath101 ( @xmath102 state ) is zero , if we consider only the wave function up to @xmath103 .",
    "then , in ref .",
    "@xcite , for this latter resonance a term identical to the contribution to the @xmath27 photoproduction on neutron target was added by hands . in this work ,",
    "the nucleon wave function with @xmath103 produces _ naturally _ a non - zero contribution with the same form as for neutron target under the @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "analogously , for meson decay amplitudes we get , @xmath104 and the ratio @xmath105 is a constant determined by the @xmath1 symmetry .    then , eq .  ( [ eq : mixar1 ] ) reads , @xmath106 where , @xmath107 so , if we remove all @xmath103 parts from the wave function of the nucleon , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , then the factor @xmath108 is a constant .",
    "however after other contributions are included , it becomes dependent on the momenta @xmath109 and @xmath110 . in this work",
    "we keep this dependence .",
    "with the formalism presented in sec.[sec : theo ] , we investigate the process @xmath111 .",
    "a chiral constituent quark model was proven  @xcite to be an appropriate approach to that end .",
    "that work embodied one free parameter per nucleon resonance , in order to take into account the breaking of the @xmath112 symmetry . in the present work , this latter phenomenon is treated via configuration mixing , reducing the number of adjustable parameters . as in refs .",
    "@xcite , we introduce resonances in @xmath87 shells , to study the @xmath27 photoproduction in the centre - of - mass energy @xmath113 gev .",
    "* * differential cross - section : * data base includes 1220 data points , for 1.49 @xmath114 1.99 gev , coming from the following labs : mami  @xcite , clas  @xcite , elsa  @xcite , lns  @xcite , and graal  @xcite . only statistical uncertainties are used . * * polarized beam asymmetry : * polarized beam asymmetries ( 184 data points ) , for 1.49 @xmath114 1.92 gev , from graal  @xcite and elsa  @xcite .",

    "the data base contains all 12 known nucleon resonances as in pdg , with @xmath115  2 gev , namely , + @xmath116*=1 : * @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath6 , @xmath98 , and @xmath101 ; + @xmath116*=2 : * @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath5 , @xmath119 , @xmath7 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 .",
    "+ besides the above isospin-1/2 resonances , we fitted also the mass of @xmath82(1232 ) resonance .",
    "however , spin-3/2 resonances do not intervene in the @xmath27 photoproduction . *",
    "* additional resonance : * resonances with masses above @xmath122  2 gev , treated as degenerate , are simulated by a single resonance , for which are left as adjustable parameters the mass , the width , and the symmetry breaking coefficient .",
    "the adjustable parameters , listed in table  [ tab : gbe_1 ] , are as follows : @xmath27 nucleon coupling ( @xmath123 ) , mass of the non - strange quarks ( @xmath124 ) , harmonic oscillator strength ( @xmath125 ) , qcd coupling constant ( @xmath62 ) , confinement constants ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 ) , three parameters @xmath78 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 related to the degenerate treatment of resonances with masses above @xmath128 2 gev , and the strength of the @xmath5 resonance .",
    "we will come back to this latter parameter .",
    "the spectrum of the known resonances put constraints on six of the adjustable parameters .",
    "five of them ( @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath62 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 ) are determined through an interplay between the mass spectrum of the resonances and the photoproduction data _ via _ the configurations mixings parameters @xmath92 ( eq .  [",
    "eq : ci ] ) .",
    "the sixth one , @xmath80 , is determined by the mass of nucleon .",

    "the parameter @xmath129 is the strength of the @xmath130 resonance , that we had to leave as a free parameter in order to avoid its too large contribution resulting from direct calculation .",
    "this latter parameter , as well as those defining the higher mass resonance ( hm @xmath131 ) are determined by the photoproduction data . notice that in fitting the photoproduction data , we use the pdg  @xcite values for masses and widths of resonances .      in recent years",
    ", several authors  @xcite have put forward need for new resonances in interpreting various observables , with extracted masses roughly between 1.73 and 2.1 gev .",
    "we have hence , investigated possible contributions from three of them : @xmath8 , @xmath134 , and @xmath9 . for each of those new resonances",
    "we introduce then three additional adjustable parameters per resonance : mass  ( @xmath78 ) , width  ( @xmath126 ) , and symmetry breaking coefficient  ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "fitting the same data base , we obtained a second model , called model @xmath136 , for which the adjustable parameters are reported in the last column of table  [ tab : gbe_1 ] .",
    "the reduced @xmath133 is very significantly improved going down from 12.37 to 2.31 . in the rest of this section , we concentrate on the model @xmath136 .",

    "<S> a formalism based on a chiral quark model ( @xmath0qm ) approach complemented with a one - gluon exchange model , to take into account the breakdown of the @xmath1 symmetry , is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the configuration mixing of wave functions for nucleon and resonances are derived . with few adjustable parameters , differential cross - section and polarized beam asymmetry for the @xmath2 process are calculated and successfully compared with the data in the centre - of - mass energy range from threshold up to 2 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the known resonances @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , as well as two new @xmath8 and @xmath9 resonances are found to be dominant in the reaction mechanism . besides , connections among the scattering amplitudes of the @xmath0qm approach and the helicity amplitudes , as well as decay widths of resonances are established . </S>",
    "<S> possible contributions from the so - called `` missing resonances '' are investigated and found to be negligible . </S>"
