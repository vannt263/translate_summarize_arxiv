    "the quantization of an isolated horizon is a remarkable success of loop quantum gravity@xcite .",
    "however , it is only an effective description , in the sense that it uses a number of elements that are not intrinsic to the formalism of loop quantum gravity .",
    "for example , the location of the horizon is fixed to be the boundary of the space - time , and the fields on the boundary , although related to those in the bulk , are quantized separately , using a symplectic structure that is derived from the one on the bulk fields in the classical theory @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present work is to advocate a slightly more intrinsic viewpoint . for this , we take as the input from the classical theory _ only _ the horizon boundary conditions @xmath0 here , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the canonical variables of loop quantum gravity , @xmath3 is the curvature of @xmath1 , @xmath4 is the dual of @xmath2 , and the arrows denote pullback to a given surface @xmath5 that is an isolated horizon @xcite of type i. we have stated here the su(2 ) isolated horizon condition from @xcite since it uses less external input .",
    "we will however also be treating a model with the u(1 ) condition from @xcite .",
    "states @xmath6 that contain a black hole horizon are then solutions to an equation  in the quantum theory  of the structure @xmath7 where the operators on both sides are defined in terms of elementary operators of loop quantum gravity",
    ". we will also refer to surfaces @xmath8 in as _",
    "horizon branes_. they can be thought of as loci of very highly excited quantum fields  such that is satisfied .",
    "such branes are not to be found in the kinematic hilbert space of loop quantum gravity .",
    "rather , these states lie in different representations of the holonomy - flux algebra , due to the branelike excitations .",
    "in fact , the present work can be viewed as a continuation of some lines of thought in the earliest work @xcite connecting horizons in loop quantum gravity to topological quantum field theory .",
    "@xcite was prescient in many ways , for example by introducing su(2 ) boundary conditions similar to , for identifying chern - simons theory as describing the horizon degrees of freedom , and for linking the size of the horizon state space to the entropy of a black hole .",
    "it also already contained the idea that the observables on the horizon should form a subablgebra of the full algebra of gravity observables .",
    "what we will do is to collect evidence that the condition allows for solutions @xmath6 that are remarkably close in structure to what has been found upon quantizing the chern - simons phase space on the horizon . in particular , we will present evidence that , by _ restricting _ such states and the loop quantum gravityoperators to the horizon , one will obtain a theory that resembles quantum su(2 ) bf theory in the spherical case , or , for general horizon topologies , isu(2 ) chern - simons theory @xcite . thus , for the case of spherical topology , which is most relevant for the description of black holes , we seem to obtain a very similar state counting .",
    "thus , no separate quantization of the horizon degrees of freedom seems to be necessary .",
    "those degrees of freedom are already part of the quantized gravitational field of loop quantum gravity .",
    "let us sketch the evidence that we have : for one thing , for a model in which the structure group su(2 ) is replaced by u(1 ) , we can find exact solutions to the analog of condition .",
    "the resulting surface theory resembles u(1 ) bf - theory coupled to particles . for the case of su(2 ) , we do not have all the technical details in hand .",
    "our preliminary analysis shows , however , that a gauge invariant state that solves is , when restricted to the brane , a solution of the constraints of su(2 ) bf theory , at least formally .    obviously , our proposal , even if made fully rigorous in the su(2 ) case , is not a fully quantum - mechanical description of black holes .",
    "for example , the horizon area still appears in .",
    "it is , rather , one step in this direction .",
    "in fact , more radical proposals have been made @xcite .",
    "some of the ideas and results contained in this work have already been implicitly or explicitly articulated in the literature on quantum isolated horizons .",
    "we have already mentioned @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite contains a detailed discussion of how to split the space of generalized connections into a boundary and a bulk part , and how the connections appearing in u(1 ) chern - simons theory with particles define generalized connections . as another example , in @xcite certain operators in su(2 ) chern - simons theory are _ identified _ with certain loop quantum gravityoperators .",
    "what is new in the present work is that we take these ideas as far as possible .    in the next section",
    ", we will use heuristic considerations to support the new picture . in sec .",
    "[ se : u1 ] we discuss , in some technical detail , a u(1 ) model .",
    "[ se : su2 ] contains the results we obtained for the su(2 ) case .",
    "we finish with a discussion of the results and open questions in sec .",
    "[ se : disc ] .",
    "in general relativity , the fields on a black hole horizon are obtained from those in the bulk by pullback or restriction .",
    "similarly , in quantum gravity , the quantized horizon degrees of freedom should result from restricting , or pulling - back , in a suitable way the quantized bulk degrees of freedom . in the previous literature on quantum isolated horizons ,",
    "the pullbacks of the bulk degrees of freedom have been quantized separately , starting from a symplectic structure that was obtained from a boundary term in the symplectic structure of general relativity . here",
    "we want to proceed differently : we start from the holonomy - flux algebra @xmath9 which is a quantization of the kinematic degrees of freedom of general relativity in the connection formulation .",
    "this algebra makes no reference to horizons or branes whatsoever",
    ". then we will look for representations of @xmath9 which contain states that solve .",
    "finally , once we have solutions of in hand , we can consider the action on these solutions , by operators localized , in a suitable sense , in @xmath5 .",
    "this constitutes the ` horizon theory ' .",
    "let us start by considering the classical theory , and make an inventory of the degrees of freedom on the horizon .",
    "in the canonical formulation , the gravitational fields live on a spatial slice @xmath10 of space - time .",
    "we take @xmath10 to be orientable and oriented . in terms of connection variables ,",
    "the fields are @xmath1 ( an su(2 ) valued connection one form ) and @xmath2 ( a triad of vector densities ) .",
    "they are coordinates in a phase space given by the poisson brackets @xmath11 we now consider a two dimensional submanifold @xmath5 of @xmath10 .",
    "we note that with a view towards black hole horizons , the case of @xmath5 being homeomorphic to @xmath12 is the most relevant one . at this point",
    ", we will however only assume that @xmath5 is compact , connected , and orientable , and we will chose an orientation .",
    "note also that @xmath5 need not be a boundary of @xmath10 . if @xmath10 has a boundary , then @xmath5 may or may not be part of that boundary .",
    "if we restrict attention to @xmath5 , we can divide up @xmath1 and @xmath2 as follows .",
    "first , we have the components intrinsic to @xmath5 , the pullbacks @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the embedding of @xmath5 in @xmath10 .",
    "we note that these fields precisely correspond to the kinematic canonical variables of su(2 ) bf theory , if the brackets are extended in a suitable way to the pullbacks .",
    "next , there are the remaining components of @xmath1 and @xmath2 on @xmath5 .",
    "these can be given as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a fixed transversal vector field on @xmath5 , and @xmath4 is the dual of @xmath2 , @xmath17 with @xmath18 the spatial triad .",
    "the conditions link @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "fixing @xmath4 and imposing the conditions on @xmath5 completely fixes the curvature of @xmath19 and hence most of the gauge invariant degrees of freedom contained in @xmath19 .",
    "what remains are essentially the holonomies around nontrivial cycles in @xmath5 .",
    "again we note that this is in analogy to su(2 ) bf theory , now after imposition of the constraints .",
    "after having organized the classical degrees of freedom on the horizon , we now come to the quantum theory . here",
    "the object we have to consider is the _ holonomy - flux _",
    "algebra @xmath21 @xcite , since it encodes , on an abstract level , the quantization chosen in loop quantum gravity .",
    "the elements of @xmath21 corresponding to @xmath1 can be thought of as functions of the holonomies of @xmath1 .",
    "they form an abelian subalgebra @xmath22 .",
    "the elements corresponding to the densitized triad @xmath2 are quantizations of the ` fluxes ' @xmath23 where @xmath8 is a surface in @xmath10 .",
    "the pullback of @xmath1 on @xmath5 is then encoded in the cylindrical functions that just depend on holonomies in @xmath5 .",
    "the pullback of @xmath2 is encoded in the flux through @xmath24 for surfaces @xmath8 transversal to @xmath5 .",
    "operators corresponding to such ` fluxes through one - dimensional submanifolds ' are sometimes also considered part of @xmath9 ( as in @xcite ) and can , in any case , be defined in the ashtekar - lewandowski ( al ) representation of @xmath9 . even if one does not want to consider these operators , the information about the pullback of @xmath4 is certainly contained in the quantized flux through @xmath8 for surfaces @xmath8 transversal to @xmath5 .    the component @xmath25 is quantized in holonomies transversal to @xmath5 , and the pullback of @xmath4 has its exclusive quantization by flux operators for surfaces @xmath8 _ within _ @xmath5 .",
    "now that we have accounted for the degrees of freedom on @xmath5 in @xmath9 , we can try to answer the question : can we consistently ask for condition , given the commutation relations in @xmath9 ?",
    "the first thing to note is that @xmath26=0 \\quad \\text { for } \\quad   \\alpha , s \\subset h ,   \\label{eq : comm}\\ ] ] which is good news as would become extremely restrictive , if not inconsistent , if the pullbacks of @xmath4 and @xmath1 were not commuting .",
    "the next thing to note is that only holonomies are contained in @xmath9 , not the connection @xmath1 itself , nor its curvature . thus can not be imposed as it stands .",
    "fortunately , the non - abelian stokes theorem ( see for example @xcite ) relates surface integrals of curvature with holonomy , @xmath27={\\mathcal{p}\\exp { \\bigcirc \\hspace{-1.35em } \\int \\hspace { -0.8em } \\int}_{s } } \\mathcal{f}[a ] .",
    "\\label{eq : stokes}\\ ] ] here @xmath28 is a loop that bounds the surface @xmath8 , @xmath29 $ ] is the curvature @xmath30 of @xmath1 , transported to the beginning / endpoint of @xmath28 , and the surface integral on the right - hand side is _",
    "surface ordered_. we should mention that for this formula to hold , @xmath8 must be simply connected .",
    "using stokes theorem , one can thus replace certain functionals depending on the curvature , with functionals depending on the connection , in the classical theory .",
    "the idea is , then , to replace with @xmath31 since surface integrals of @xmath4 act nontrivially only at transverse intersections by holonomies , a spin network edge which punctures @xmath5 will correspond to nontrivial holonomy around @xmath32 , see fig .",
    "[ fi : flux_hol ] .",
    "but now an immediate concern is whether it is possible to define the complicated operator  let us call it @xmath33  on the right - hand side .",
    "for the _ trace _ of @xmath33 in the @xmath34-representation this question was answered affirmatively in @xcite .",
    "we will describe some of the details below , in sec .",
    "[ se : su2 ] . here",
    "it suffices to say that the main difficulty in defining the right - hand side is that because the components of @xmath4 do not commute , there is an ordering ambiguity .",
    "the authors of @xcite pointed out a way to resolve this ordering ambiguity by using a device from the theory of lie algebras , the _ duflo map_. using this ordering , spin network functions are eigenstates of the operator @xmath35 under many circumstances , and the corresponding eigenvalues are related to path integral expectation values of wilson loops in su(2 ) chern - simons theory .",
    "we remark that there is an apparent contradiction between the fact , that holonomies in @xmath9 commute , whereas the operators @xmath33 certainly do not commute with holonomies in general .",
    "so how can it be equal to a holonomy ?",
    "the resolution is that it is certainly not equal to a holonomy in general , being a highly nontrivial condition on the state .",
    "the only thing that follows from this consideration is that the action of holonomy operators on a solution @xmath6 of can , in general , not be a solution again .",
    "while both sides of are defined in the al representation , the standard representation of loop quantum gravity , there are no solutions to in this representation .",
    "to find solutions of , there are then at least two possible strategies : one can take the properties of the operators on the left - hand side in the al representation of @xmath9 , and use them to define a nonstandard representation of the operators on the right - hand side , or , vice versa , use the standard representation of the right to seek a nonstandard representation of the left - hand side .",
    "we chose the latter possibility in this article , for the reason that the results seem to compare well with previous work .    in the al representation of @xmath9 , the action of flux operators @xmath36",
    "is concentrated on transversal intersections of holonomies with @xmath8 , and this continues to hold for the operator @xmath35 .",
    "thus we need to find a state such that this is the case also for holonomies within @xmath5 .",
    "we can use the fact that the space of generalized connections factorizes into a space of connections on @xmath5 , and a space of connections in the ` bulk ' @xmath37 the standard representation is defined by the al measure on @xmath38 .",
    "the idea is now to modify this measure on @xmath39 in a suitable way .",
    "essentially what one wants to define are measures @xmath40(x)-\\sum_i c_i\\delta^{(h)}(p_i , x)\\right ) { \\text{d}\\mu_{\\text{al}}}\\rvert_{\\operatorname{\\overline{\\mathcal{a}}}_h}\\times { \\text{d}\\mu_{\\text{al}}}\\rvert_{\\operatorname{\\overline{\\mathcal{a}}}_\\perp } \\label{eq : meas}\\ ] ] where the first delta function is a _",
    "functional _ dirac - delta - function , and the second one is the ordinary dirac delta on @xmath5 . in the hilbert space generated by such a measure , one can then find solutions to , by considering spin networks that end in the points @xmath41 , and adjusting the constants @xmath42 appropriately . in the u(1 ) model",
    ", this construction goes through quite literally . in the su(2 )",
    "case , we have no rigorous proof that , with the right - hand side evaluated on a state in the al representation , rigorously defines a measure on @xmath39 , of the form indicated above .",
    "but it is clear that , with the right - hand side well defined , _ the holonomies on all contractible loops in @xmath5 are fixed _ , at least up to conjugation , and thus there are no local gauge invariant degrees of freedom left in the holonomies on @xmath5 .",
    "there _ are _ , however , holonomies that are not fixed by , holonomies that run between punctures , and also around nontrivial cycles of @xmath5 if not simply connected .",
    "there are thus nontrivial holonomy operators for those , and thus provided that the measures can be constructed rigorously , all the observables related to the connection are represented .    what about the fluxes ?",
    "what happens to the flux operators when one changes the measure has been studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "the upshot is that if one modifies the measure , one has to modify the fluxes by adding a divergence term , @xmath43 to have the operators still symmetric . here",
    "@xmath44 is a certain derivation on the cylindrical functions .",
    "this divergence can be ill - defined ( more precisely , not @xmath45 as would be required ) for a delta - function in the measure , thus existence of symmetric flux operators @xmath46 for which @xmath8 touches the surface is , at first sight , questionable .",
    "but it turns out that all the fluxes one needs are actually well defined for a measure of the form .",
    "first off , the delta function in concerns only @xmath19 , but @xmath20 corresponds to an operator acting on @xmath25 .",
    "thus all the fluxes @xmath46 with @xmath47 are well defined and symmetric without any change . moreover , whenever a holonomy variable is constrained by the delta function in the measure , there is _ no _ corresponding degree of freedom in the quantum theory , hence no way for any fluxes to act in a nontrivial way .",
    "vice versa , the action of the flux operators is well defined on holonomies that represent degrees of freedom leftover under the measure . to summarize",
    ", some flux operators may not be well defined , but their failure to exist can be understood easily , and they are not needed for the physical interpretation of the resulting theory , anyway .",
    "let us make some remarks about the properties of the measure and the consequences for the state spaces : the first one is that in the case of @xmath5 being a topological sphere , there are no nontrivial cycles , so the only degrees of freedom on @xmath5 reside in holonomies connecting the punctures ( and in the conjugate fluxes ) .",
    "gauge invariant states are constructed out of such holonomies , and holonomies in the bulk , by forming spin networks . a priori",
    ", there are many different ways of forming the spin network component on @xmath5 but many of them will describe the same state , due to the flatness constraint built into the measure .",
    "in fact we will argue that the independent states on @xmath5 , given the punctures , are labeled by a _ single intertwiner _ between the spins at the punctures .",
    "this is very close to the pictures in @xcite .",
    "note that this is fully born out in the u(1 ) case .",
    "the second remark is that , again due to the flatness constraint built into the measure , the exchange of punctures leads to the same state up to a nontrivial phase .",
    "thus the punctures enjoy a nonstandard statistics , and counting states modulo diffeomorphisms is nontrivial .",
    "this is again reminiscent of @xcite , and it is actually vital to obtain proportionality between area and entropy of the horizon .    the arguments that we have given so far are somewhat heuristic , if encouraging .",
    "we will show , however , that they can be made completely precise in a model with structure group u(1 ) , to which we turn next .",
    "we will then begin to address the case of structure group su(2 ) .",
    "we will discuss more details in sec .",
    "[ se : su2 ] .",
    "in this section , we consider the kinematics of loop quantum gravity , but with the structure group su(2 ) replaced by u(1 ) @xcite . in this model",
    "we replace condition by @xmath48 between a quantized u(1 ) connection @xmath1 and a quantized vector density @xmath2 .",
    "note that this is precisely the isolated horizon condition obtained by gauge fixing to u(1 ) as used in @xcite .",
    "much of the material of this section will remain valid if the gauge fixing is just carried out on the horizon , in particular the quantum theory on the horizon as far as the connection is concerned .",
    "irreducible representations of u(1 ) are labeled by integers , and hence the generalized spin networks correspond to functions @xmath49=\\prod_{e\\in \\gamma } ( h_e[a])^{n_e } ,      \\ ] ] which are usually called charge networks .",
    "they are gauge invariant , whenever the incoming charges equal the outgoing charges at each vertex , @xmath50 charge nets commute with the operator @xmath46 as follows : @xmath51 & = x_s[t_{\\gamma,{\\underline{n}}}]\\\\ & = 2\\pi\\beta { \\ell_\\text{p}}^2 \\left[\\sum_{v\\in\\gamma\\cup s}\\ , \\sum_{e \\text { at } v } \\sigma(e ) n_e\\right ] \\ , t_{\\gamma,{\\underline{n } } } , \\label{eq : su1 } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where it is assumed that all edges intersect @xmath8 in vertices of @xmath52 and @xmath53 is + 1 , -1 , or 0 , depending on whether the edge is oriented consistently and @xmath10 carry orientations .",
    "let @xmath54 be a positively oriented basis of tangent vectors to @xmath8 .",
    "then if @xmath55 is positively oriented in @xmath10 , with @xmath56 the tangent of @xmath18 in the intersection point , then we call the orientations of @xmath18 and @xmath8 consistent . ] with the surface , the opposite way as the surface , or is tangential to the surface .",
    "@xmath57 is a derivation on the space of charge nets .",
    "given a charge network , we can always decompose it as @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 intersects @xmath5 only transversally .",
    "thus given @xmath61 , in view of , we need a state @xmath6 such that for loops @xmath62 in @xmath5 , we would have @xmath63 where we have set @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we will call @xmath66 puncture data .",
    "equation means that the connection on @xmath5 must be a ( quantized ) flat connection , @xmath67 we will see however , that due to the fact that only speaks about holonomies , not the curvature itself , if we change the puncture data , by adding to each @xmath68 a multiple of @xmath69 , the quantum state on the horizon will not change .",
    "thus one may also view the @xmath68 as elements of @xmath70 .",
    "we will now define a functional on charge networks that can be regarded as lebesgue integral on connections that fulfill for some puncture data @xmath71 .",
    "we will see that in the case that @xmath72 the functional is only well defined if @xmath73 and that the actual parameters of the state we construct are not the @xmath68 but the @xmath74 .",
    "let us also define @xmath75 .",
    "it is clear what to do in principle : a given charge network @xmath76 with @xmath77 needs to be decomposed into factors such that we can apply to split the variables into ones that are free , and ones that are determined .",
    "but this has to happen in a consistent way , and the bookkeeping involved in doing this by hand gets unwieldy very quickly .",
    "fortunately homology theory comes to the rescue ( see for example @xcite for a gentle introduction to the concepts used below ) . note first that by subdividing and adding edges , @xmath52 can always be made into the 1-skeleton of a subcomplex of the singular chain complex of @xmath78 .",
    "then , given this subcomplex , a labeling of the graph edges with charges @xmath79 defines a 1-chain @xmath80 with integer coefficients .",
    "@xmath76 is gauge invariant precisely when @xmath79 is a cycle , @xmath81 .",
    "there is a natural pairing between chains and one - forms , and in particular between the chain @xmath79 and connections @xmath1 , @xmath82 the connections @xmath1 relevant for the definition of the functional are flat , @xmath83 .",
    "let us assume for the moment that @xmath81 .",
    "then the above pairing is gauge invariant , and @xmath84 is a functional on the first de rham cohomology @xmath85 . let @xmath86 be a basis of elementary cycles of @xmath78 , and let @xmath87 be the dual basis in @xmath85 .",
    "then we introduce parameters @xmath88 to write @xmath89 now we can define the state .",
    "let @xmath90 note that this formula is manifestly invariant under subdivison of the graph underlying @xmath79 , and under adding new edges .",
    "it is thus _ consistent _ with the equivalence of labelings of charge network functions .",
    "it also defines a positive functional . to see this ,",
    ". then @xmath92 before we study further properties , let us extend this definition to a state @xmath93 on not necessarily gauge invariant charge networks , by simply declaring @xmath93 to be @xmath94 on gauge invariant charge networks , and zero otherwise . more formally ,",
    "let @xmath95 this does not spoil positivity : it can be easily seen that @xmath96 is positive . thus , given charge nets @xmath97 , the matrices @xmath98 are positive semidefinite .",
    "but then the hadamard product @xmath99 ( obtained by multiplying the matrices entrywise ) is positive semidefinite according to the schur product theorem , and hence for @xmath91 @xmath100 now we discuss the gns representation given by @xmath93 .",
    "we will denote the ground state by @xmath101 , and the gns state corresponding to @xmath76 by @xmath102 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath52 is left implicit to improve readability . note",
    "that since @xmath93 has a large kernel , many gns vectors actually have zero norm .",
    "first , let @xmath28 be the boundary of a surface @xmath8 in @xmath5 .",
    "then either @xmath28 is contractible , in which case for the corresponding cycle we can write @xmath32 , and note @xmath103 or @xmath28 goes around a puncture , in which case @xmath104 for some @xmath105 that is in a delta - function in .",
    "thus for arbitrary @xmath79 we find @xmath106 since the vectors @xmath107 are dense by construction , this shows that @xmath108 is an eigenstate to @xmath109 , and that it solves .",
    "since charge networks commute , the calculation also shows that @xmath110 is again a solution to , where @xmath52 is any graph in @xmath5 .",
    "let us now briefly discuss the properties of the state under diffeomorphisms .",
    "it turns out that for a diffeomorphism @xmath111 of @xmath5 that is connected to the identity and that fixes the punctures , as well as the boundary 0-cycle @xmath112 of a charge net @xmath76 , one finds @xmath113 we will not prove this in detail , but just sketch the idea . consider first an edge @xmath18 in @xmath5 and its image @xmath114 under a diffeomorphism @xmath111 that is the identity outside of a compact region , and drags part of @xmath18 as in fig .",
    "[ fi : diffeo1 ] . in this case @xmath115 and @xmath116 are related by a cycle @xmath28 , @xmath117    if @xmath111 fixes the punctures , @xmath28 can not contain a puncture , and we find @xmath118 since @xmath119 and hence @xmath120 .",
    "thus @xmath121 . with a similar calculation",
    ", one can show that one can move gauge invariant vertices in a charge network without changing the corresponding gns state ( see fig .",
    "[ fi : diffeo2 ] ) .      we can now extend the state we found in the preceding section even further , to charge networks @xmath76 that have graphs in @xmath10 . to that end",
    "we use the decomposition of a general charge net @xmath76 into the product @xmath122 where the first factor is entirely in @xmath5 and the second is transversal to @xmath5 .",
    "then set @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the state devised by ashtekar , isham and lewandowski .",
    "@xmath125 is positive by virtue of the schur product theorem : for @xmath91 we have @xmath126 where the product on the right - hand side is again the hadamard product , and the matrices @xmath127 are positive semidefinite , because @xmath93 and @xmath124 are .    thus for each puncture data @xmath128",
    ", we have found a state on the charge networks .",
    "the resulting gns representation has the properties we have discussed in the previous section on @xmath5 , and the standard properties of the al representation away from @xmath5 .",
    "we note that according to general results @xcite , the state @xmath125 defines a measure on generalized connections on @xmath10 .    given this representation of `` half '' of the holonomy - flux algebra @xmath9",
    ", we will now briefly discuss whether the flux operators @xmath46 can be represented alongside the charge networks .",
    "how this question can be answered for general representations has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the main obstruction is that the fluxes have to be symmetric , thus for nontrivial measures on generalized connections , a ` divergence term ' has to be added to the derivative , see .",
    "this divergence term may fail to exist in the proper sense , thus making it impossible to represent flux operators .",

    "all flux operators @xmath46 with @xmath47 can be defined . *",
    "all flux operators @xmath46 with @xmath24 a 1-cycle can be defined using the orientation of @xmath8 , the orientation of @xmath10 and the orientation of @xmath5 .",
    "] can be defined .",
    "the first point is obvious .",
    "the second point is due to the fact that the derivations @xmath57 related to flux operators for surfaces @xmath47 only act nontrivially on holonomies that intersect @xmath8 , and hence @xmath5 , transversally . but the measure relevant for those edges is just the al measure , and hence no divergence term is needed .",
    "there is a problem representing fluxes through @xmath8 where @xmath24 is not a cycle .",

    "@xmath169 having one spin-@xmath167 edge puncturing @xmath8 and exiting @xmath8 on the other side , we find @xmath170 and one can show that higher spin punctures continue to be eigenvectors for @xmath171 .",
    "the constant @xmath172 in the above formulas is given by @xmath173 with @xmath174 furthermore , one can show that this pattern continues for traces in other irreducible representations , @xmath175 but we have no closed formula for the eigenvalues @xmath176 .",
    "we note that @xmath177 is the path integral expectation value for an unknotted wilson loop in the @xmath34 representation , in su(2 ) chern - simons theory with level @xmath69 , and @xmath178 is related to the expectation value of linked wilson loops @xcite .",
    "we thus suspect that all the @xmath176 are related to su(2 ) chern - simons theory in a similar way .    moreover",
    ", one can see that states @xmath179 having one spin-@xmath167 edge puncturing @xmath8 and _ ending _ on @xmath8 are again eigenvectors , @xmath180 we stress that the eigenvalues in , , are completely independent of the shape of @xmath8 , as long as the boundary of @xmath8 encloses the puncture .",
    "( this is obvious for , but it is also true in all the other cases , as can be seen with the methods in @xcite . )    the cases that several edges pierce @xmath5 in the same puncture , and that a surface contains several punctures are more complicated , and there are indications that the spin nets puncturing the surface may not be eigenstates in general .",
    "it is _ not _ true that the operators @xmath33 _ themselves _ are diagonalized by the states @xmath181 .",
    "what happens is that the surface @xmath8 in comes with extra structure from the non - abelian stokes theorem : this involves the choice of a system of paths in @xmath182 , connecting the beginning / endpoint of @xmath28 with the points of @xmath8 .",
    "when acting on a state @xmath183 , the operator will in general give back a sum of spin networks , some of which involve holonomies along the path system in @xmath8 that are coupled via suitable intertwiners to the spin network edge piercing the surface @xmath8 .",
    "there is , however , a crucial exception : going through the same steps that were used in @xcite to calculate @xmath184 , one finds @xmath185 this result is natural , since for the state @xmath186 , there is nothing the holonomies along the path system in @xmath8 can couple to .",
    "it should however also be said that the case @xmath186 is special in that there is a divergence in the eigenvalue that has to be renormalized away @xcite , so this case merits further careful investigation . in particular",
    ", it is not entirely clear what the value of finite constant @xmath187 leftover in should be .",
    "if we follow the argument in @xcite , the answer would be @xmath188 it is noteworthy that in @xcite , @xmath187 sets the normalization of the jones polynomial , which in principle is arbitrary .",
    "thus it is conceivable that another way to remove the divergence would yield another value , in particular , @xmath189 .",
    "a final remark is about the properties of @xmath33 under change of orientation of @xmath8 .",
    "from @xcite we know @xmath190 where @xmath191 is obtained from @xmath8 by change of orientation .",
    "now we can come back to our main topic : what do the properties of @xmath33 listed above mean for our goal of defining a measure on @xmath39 through ?",
    "the first thing to note is that because @xmath192 are diagonal on the states @xmath181 , so must be the traces @xmath193 of holonomies around loops @xmath28 in @xmath5 . in particular",
    "their quantum - mechanical fluctuations must vanish , @xmath194 which shows that the gauge invariant information contained in contractible loops on @xmath5 is completely fixed by the puncture data @xmath128 , and supports the idea that representations that contain horizons should be based on a measure of a form similar to .    to formalize this ,",
    "let us again pick puncture data @xmath195 where @xmath196 are points on @xmath5 and @xmath197 and @xmath198 are labels of irreducible representations of su(2 ) , and magnetic quantum numbers in those representations .",
    "furthermore , we will denote traces of holonomy functionals as @xmath199:= \\operatorname{tr}_j(h_\\alpha[a ] ) . \\ ] ] now let @xmath200 be a collection of loops that are contractible within @xmath5 , and such that each one of them encloses at most one puncture in @xmath128 .",
    "we will also call such loops _ simple_. then to each simple loop there is an oriented disc @xmath201 in @xmath5 , such that @xmath202 , and we can set @xmath203 where the numbers @xmath204 are the eigenvalues from , i.e. , we have assumed that the punctures @xmath128 come from edges ending in @xmath5",
    ". this can be generalized in an obvious way to the case where some of the piercing edges do not end on @xmath5 .",
    "linear extension of this definition gives a functional on a large class of gauge invariant functionals of the pullback of @xmath1 to @xmath5 .",
    "next we check positivity : the first remark is that due to the unitarity of the irreducible representations of su(2 ) , we have @xmath205}=t_{-\\alpha , j}[a ] ,   \\ ] ] where we denote with @xmath206 the change of orientation of @xmath28 . if @xmath119 , then @xmath207 .",
    "taking this together with gives @xmath208 similar statements can be made for products of traces , due to the factorization property of . with this",
    "said , let @xmath209 be a collection of multiloops , where the individual loops again fulfill the requirements assumed in the definition of @xmath93 , and @xmath210 corresponding assignments of representations .",
    "then we consider the expectation value of the modulus squared of the function @xmath211 , @xmath212 so the functional is positive .",
    "this is very encouraging .",
    "there is , however , another important property that we can not yet check for @xmath93 . because of the properties of the operators @xmath33 , we have defined @xmath93 such that it factorizes , @xmath213 the problem is that the product among the functionals @xmath214 is not free .",
    "for example , we have @xmath215 for some constants",
    "we have no formal proof that @xmath93 is compatible with these relations , but we have some indication that that is indeed the case .",
    "the point is that the expression @xmath217\\,\\text{d}^2 s \\ ] ] that is identical to a holonomy by virtue of the non - abelian stokes theorem differs from the operator @xmath33 only by the fact that certain polynomials in @xmath3 are replaced by operators in the universal enveloping algebra u(su(2 ) ) of su(2 ) .",
    "therefor , @xmath33 can lose properties of a holonomy only at that point .",
    "now , the replacement of polynomials of @xmath3 by operators is done using the duflo map , which insures that the replacement is an isomorphism of algebras on the gauge invariant polynomials of @xmath3 , thus on this subspace it does not lose any structure . moreover , in the calculations of eigenvalues in @xcite , only that subspace was relevant .",
    "thus we conjecture @xmath218 and similar relations among the eigenvalues of the @xmath219 that make @xmath93 consistent .",
    "if we grant consistency of @xmath93 as above , what is left to do ? the algebra of the simple loops above does not include holonomies around noncontractible loops , nor does it contain gauge noninvariant functionals .",
    "we have to show that the functional extends consistently to this larger class of holonomy functionals on @xmath5 .",
    "then it can be extended further to @xmath22 with exactly the same arguments used in sec .",
    "[ se : ext ] .",
    "finally one would have to consider the action of the fluxes , but the situation is exactly the same as for the fluxes in the u(1 ) case , and so we forsee no difficulty with defining all the physically relevant flux operators . since the bookkeeping involved in these steps is quite complicated",
    ", we leave their completion to another work @xcite .",
    "we will finish by commenting on some ramifications of the picture that emerges .",
    "is the state @xmath93 extended to all cylindrical functions , supported on connections that are locally flat , except at the punctures ?",
    "the answer seems to be yes .",
    "note first that the definition of the state @xmath93 on simple loops makes no reference to the precise location of the loops , apart from that they must enclose at most one puncture .",
    "note furthermore that due to , for @xmath220 the operator @xmath109 ( not just its trace ) must be represented by a multiple of the identity due to the measure .",
    "this makes holonomies @xmath221 in @xmath5 dependent only on the homotopy class of @xmath18 in @xmath5 with the punctures removed .",
    "for example , consider @xmath221 for the path @xmath222 depicted in fig .",
    "[ fi : tree_change_na ] .",
    "we have @xmath223 certainly this is acceptable only if @xmath189 , but as we have said above , one can argue that @xmath187 depends on normalization and has to be set by hand , anyway .",
    "if this is done , we have indeed @xmath224 for the path @xmath225 and @xmath6 a solution , and similar identities in more complicated situations .    thus altogether , given what we know about the operators @xmath33 , it seems that the program of finding rigorous solutions to has a chance to succeed , in a very similar way as it did for the case of the u(1 ) theory . obviously , there are still some steps to be taken .",
    "there is work in progress on these issues , and results will be reported in a future publication @xcite .",
    "in the present work we have taken the condition for an isolated horizon from classical general relativity , expressed it as an equation [ , and , respectively ] in the quantum theory using operators in the holonomy - flux algebra @xmath9 of loop quantum gravity , and studied one class of solutions , both for a u(1 ) model and for the full su(2 ) theory . in the u(1 ) case , we could complete all the steps , in the su(2 ) case there are still some open questions .",
    "our procedure is quite different from the one followed so far @xcite in which one , roughly speaking , quantizes the phase space of space - times that contain an isolated horizon as an inner boundary , see fig .",
    "[ fi : commut ] .    classically , the degrees of freedom that live on the horizon are part of the full field content of general relativity . in our treatment , this is transparent in the quantum theory : the horizon degrees of freedom are represented simply by elements ( or components of elements ) of the algebra @xmath9 that characterizes loop quantum gravityand makes no reference to horizons .",
    "it was not clear _ a priori _ , whether the results of the two routes to quantum isolated horizons would coincide , but it turned out that it appears they do to a remarkable extent . in the u(1 ) case , we recover almost verbatim the structure of the quantized horizon of @xcite . in the su(2 ) case , our results are not complete , but what we saw points towards a very similar picture as @xcite .",
    "there are differences , however , and they become more obvious if one considers the case of nontrivial horizon topology . then the picture we obtain on the horizon is not so much resembling quantized u(1 ) or su(2 ) chern - simons theory , as quantized u(1 ) or su(2 ) bf - theory , i.e. chern - simons theory with ` twice as many degrees of freedom ' .",
    "for example , in the torus case we see two holonomies and two conjugate fluxes , whereas one would expect that the two holonomies are conjugate to each other for u(1 ) or su(2 ) chern - simons theory .",
    "this does not make much difference for the horizon of spherical topology that is most relevant for the description of black holes , but it may be interesting from a conceptual viewpoint : we find that _ loop quantum gravity , restricted to certain special null - hypersurfaces , gives euclidean quantum gravity in three dimensions_.    from the conceptual standpoint taken in this work , the su(2 ) version of the isolated horizon boundary condition seems more attractive , since less classical structure is needed in the quantum theory , and we have a chance to account for all quantum degrees of freedom with the algebra @xmath9 . if only one of the three components of the su(2 ) connection @xmath1 is fixed by the horizon conditions , there are two other components free on the horizon .",
    "since they do not form a connection , they are hard to treat with loop quantum gravitymethods .",
    "this is the reason for treating the u(1 ) case with gauge fixing to u(1 ) _ everywhere_. but if one wishes , one can certainly gauge fix only on the horizon , and our methods will essentially give back the picture of @xcite .      1 .   for the case that the horizon is not a boundary of @xmath10 , the counting of horizon states of a given area may be modified due to the fact that gauge charge can now enter _ and _ leave at the punctures .",
    "this means that the area - entropy relation may be modified - a potential problem for the approach .",
    "this needs to be studied in detail .",
    "it is odd that the classical horizon area @xmath226 shows up in the quantum horizon condition , and consequently all over the place in the quantum theory .",
    "it would be very nice if this can be changed , either through a change in the classical theory as sketched in @xcite or through replacing @xmath226 in by a suitable operator .",
    "3 .   since the states containing a horizon and the vacuum state of loop quantum gravityare states on the same algebra",
    ", it is now possible to relate them . in particular , it should be possible to approximate the states with a horizon by states in the vacuum ( al ) representation .",
    "the implementation of diffeomorphisms that move punctures should be studied carefully , to confirm the anyonic statistics of the punctures in both , the u(1 ) and the su(2 ) case .",
    "the type of solutions of the quantum horizon condition we found may not be the only one .",
    "note for example that we took the flux as given from the vacuum representation of loop quantum gravity , and thereby fixed the connection on the horizon .",
    "one could think of doing it the other way around , taking the holonomy operators on the horizon to be in the loop quantum gravityvaccum , and thereby determine a nonstandard representation of the fluxes .",
    "there may be other possibilities .",
    "this merits further thought .",
