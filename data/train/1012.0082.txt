    "the past few years have seen many important developments concerning hadron colliders , especially the advent of the lhc .",
    "recently , the discovery of and searches for double charm baryons have been reported by various experimental collaborations @xcite .",
    "one is convinced that more and more doubly heavy baryons will be observed in the near future .",
    "consequently , it is an urgent task for theorists to investigate the properties of these states .    on the other hand",
    ", the existence of three valence quarks in a baryon makes the theoretical study much more complicated than the case of mesons .",
    "people have suggested the presence of diquark structure in a baryon and studied the properties of heavy baryons in such a picture @xcite .",
    "no matter whether the diquark is a real physical object or simply a theoretical approximation , this picture reduces the three body system to a two body problem which is much simpler for investigation .    in recent years ,",
    "heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) has been widely used in the study of doubly heavy baryons @xcite .",
    "two heavy quarks are reasonably bound into a color - antitriplet heavy diquark whose radius is much smaller than the typical scale ( @xmath1 ) of the nonperturbative qcd interactions in the heavy quark limit ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 denotes the heavy quark mass ) .",
    "the leftover light quark involved in the baryon moves in the color field induced by the heavy diquark .",
    "unlike the heavy quark and light quark system , the internal motion in the heavy diquark can not be ignored even at leading order in the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "this is because the relative momentum in the heavy diquark is not simply @xmath4 , but @xmath5 as calculated in the coulomb potential model @xcite .    as a formally exact equation to describe the relativistic bound system , the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation",
    "was initially formulated in minkowski space based on the relativistic quantum theory @xcite .",
    "however , it is difficult to solve the bs equation in minkowski space due to its singular behavior . in order to overcome this difficulty , with the so - called `` wick rotation '' ,",
    "the formalism for the bs equation in euclidean space was developed and investigated in detail @xcite . with the perturbation theory integral representation ,",
    "the bs equation was solved in minkowski space for the scalar and fermion systems @xcite .",
    "recently , based on the nakanishi integral representation of the bs amplitude and the projection of the bs equation on the light - front plane , a new method for solving the bs equation in minkowski space was proposed and was applied to study the electromagnetic form factor @xcite . in another formalism to solve the bs equation , the covariant instantaneous approximation is adopted in the kernel . in recent decades , this formalism has been successfully used to investigate heavy mesons , heavy baryons , and exotic states @xcite .",
    "based on the diquark picture of the composition of the doubly heavy baryon , we will establish the bs equations for both the heavy diquarks and the doubly heavy baryons in the leading order of a @xmath0 expansion .",
    "motivated by the potential model , the kernel for the bs equation is assumed to be composed of the scalar confinement and one - gluon - exchange terms @xcite .",
    "we will solve the bs equations numerically under the covariant instantaneous approximation @xcite .",
    "since the heavy diquark is not really a point object , a few form factors for the effective vertex of the heavy diquark coupling to the gluon are introduced to reflect the inner structure of the heavy diquark .",
    "these form factors will be expressed in terms of the bs wave functions obtained for the heavy diquarks .",
    "finally , we will calculate the non - leptonic decay widths for the doubly heavy baryons emitting a pseudo - scalar meson in the bs formalism .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we establish the bs equation for the heavy diquarks in the leading order of @xmath0 expansion .",
    "we also give the normalization conditions for the bs wave functions for the heavy diquarks in this section . in sec .",
    "iii , the form factors for the effective vertex of the heavy diquark coupling to the gluon are derived from the bs wave functions obtained for the heavy diquarks . in sec .",
    "iv , we establish the bs equation for the doubly heavy baryons at leading order in the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "the normalization conditions for the bs wave functions for the doubly heavy baryons are also given in this section . in sec .",
    "v , the non - leptonic decay widths for the doubly heavy baryons emitting a pseudo - scalar meson are calculated in the bs formalism .",
    "vi is reserved for our summary and some discussions .",
    "in general , the parity of a ground state baryon is positive .",
    "since the parity of quark is supposed to be positive , the parity of the diquark involved in a ground state baryon should be positive .",
    "due to the pauli principle , two quarks with the same flavor can only constitute an axial - vector diquark . on the other hand ,",
    "two quarks with different flavors can constitute either a scalar diquark or an axial - vector diquark .",
    "it can be easily shown that a heavy diquark which is in the ground state can not be a tensor diquark .",
    "suppose two heavy quarks @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( with masses @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively ) compose a ground state heavy diquark .",
    "define two ratios @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the bs wave function for the heavy diquark is defined as follows : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 stand for the field operators of the heavy quarks @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , @xmath15 represent the color indices , @xmath16 and @xmath17 represent the spin indices , @xmath18 is the coordinate of the heavy diquark mass center , @xmath19 is the relative coordinate of the two heavy quarks , @xmath20 is the momentum of the heavy diquark , and @xmath21 is the relative momentum between the two heavy quarks .",
    "the bs equation for the heavy diquark can be written in the following form ( details can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath22    \\chi_{p_{d}}(p^{\\prime}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the momenta of heavy quarks @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the propagators of heavy quarks @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the one - gluon - exchange and scalar confinement terms of the kernel for the bs equation given by ( after imposing the covariant instantaneous approximation @xcite ) : @xmath29 and @xmath30^{2}}-(2\\pi)^{3}\\delta^{3}(p_{t}-p_{t}^{\\prime } )    \\int\\frac{{\\rm    d}^{3}k_{t}}{(2\\pi)^{3}}\\frac{4i\\pi\\kappa}{[-(p_{t}-k_{t})^2+\\mu^{2}]^{2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the coupling parameters related to one - gluon - exchange and scalar confinement terms , respectively , @xmath33 is the transverse projection of the relative momentum ( @xmath21 ) along the heavy diquark momentum ( @xmath20 ) ( see the definition below eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) ) , the second term of @xmath28 is introduced to remove the infrared singularity near the point @xmath34 , and the small parameter @xmath35 is introduced to avoid the divergence in the numerical calculations .",
    "this kernel is motivated by the potential model which has been successfully applied in mesons @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the kernel of the heavy diquark is related to the meson by the one - half rule @xcite .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) can be written in a more usual matrix form as @xcite @xmath36s(-p_{1}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 ( @xmath38 is the charge conjugation matrix ) and the superscript @xmath39 represents the transpose of the spinor indices .    in the leading order of a @xmath0 expansion",
    ", the heavy quark propagators ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) can be written as @xmath40 and @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the mass and velocity of the heavy diquark , respectively , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the longitudinal and transverse projections of the relative momentum ( @xmath21 ) along the heavy diquark momentum ( @xmath20 ) , respectively , the energy @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the infinitesimal . as studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath48 is @xmath49 .",
    "consequently , @xmath50 terms should not be neglected in calculations carried out to leading order in the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "substituting eqs .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) ( [ eq:8 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) , one finds the following two constraints for the bs wave function for the heavy diquarks : @xmath51    then , taking these constraints into account in the bs equation for the positive parity and zero angular momentum ground state of the heavy diquark system , the bs wave functions for the scalar and the axial - vector heavy diquarks can be parametrized in the following forms , respectively : @xmath52 and @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the @xmath55-th polarization vector of the axial - vector heavy diquark , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the lorentz - scalar functions of @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "after some algebra , we find that the bs scalar wave functions for both the scalar heavy diquark ( @xmath56 ) and the axial - vector heavy diquark ( @xmath57 ) satisfy the same integral equation as follows : @xmath61{\\tilde f}(p^{\\prime}_{t}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we define @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "in general , the normalization condition for the heavy diquark can be written as ( after imposing the covariant instantaneous approximation on the kernel ) @xcite @xmath65^{i_{1}i_{2}j_{2}j_{1}}\\chi_{p_{d}}(p^{\\prime})=1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 and @xmath67 represent the color indices of the heavy quarks , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 stands for the inverse of the four point function , @xmath70^{-1}[s(p_{2})\\gamma_{0}]^{-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now , it is straightforward to obtain the normalization condition for the bs wave function for the heavy diquark as the following : @xmath71\\nonumber\\\\    + { \\rm    tr}[\\lambda_{2}s(-p_{1}){\\tilde{\\tilde    \\chi}}_{p_{d}}^{(c)}(p_{t})s(p_{2})\\rlap/\\varepsilon s(p_{2}){\\tilde{\\tilde    \\chi}}_{p_{d}}(p_{t})]\\bigl\\}=1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the transverse projections of the bs wave function given by @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively .    for the scalar heavy diquark , the transverse projections of the bs wave function ( @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) can be obtained from eqs .",

    ", the transverse projections of the bs wave function ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) can be obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:17 ] ) ( [ eq:18 ] ) as follows respectively : @xmath85 and @xmath86 where @xmath87{\\tilde f}(p^{\\prime}_{t } ) ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath88    analogously , the normalization condition for the bs wave function for the axial - vector heavy diquark is given by @xmath89^{2}=1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the numerical calculations , we take the constituent masses of the heavy quarks to be @xmath90 and @xmath91 which were obtained by fitting the real spectra of charmonium and bottomonium in ref .",
    "the parameters in the kernel @xmath92 and @xmath93 are determined by fitting the experimental data for heavy meson spectra @xcite . in order to solve the integral equation ( [ eq:13 ] ) , we discretize the integration region into @xmath94 pieces ( with @xmath94 sufficiently large ) .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ eq:13 ] ) becomes an eigenvalue equation for the @xmath94 dimensional vector @xmath95 . after solving the eigenvalue equation ,",
    "the heavy diquark masses are obtained and are displayed in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "we find that the heavy diquark masses are independent of the heavy diquark spin and only determined by the flavors of the constituent heavy quarks . in fig .  1 , the normalized bs scalar wave functions for the heavy diquarks are shown .",
    "it can be seen that the amplitudes of the bs scalar wave functions do not distinguish the different spins of the heavy diquarks . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , unlike the heavy quark and light quark system , only the spin symmetry survives ( when the diquark mass is below @xmath96 ) in the leading order @xmath0 expansion for the heavy diquark system .",
    "our results are consistent with this statement .",
    ".[tab:1]values of the heavy diquark masses used here . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in the heavy quark limit , a doubly heavy baryon can be regarded as a bound state composed of a heavy diquark and a light quark .",
    "we first establish the bs equations for both the heavy diquarks and the doubly heavy baryons , respectively , in the leading order of a @xmath0 expansion .",
    "the kernel for the bs equation contains the scalar confinement and one - gluon - exchange terms , which are motivated by the potential model and successfully used in the cases of mesons and heavy baryons containing a single heavy quark . since the size of the heavy diquark",
    "is enhanced by @xmath97 with respect to @xmath0 , we also introduce a few form factors to the effective vertex for the heavy diquark coupling to the gluon in order to reflect the inner structure of the heavy diquark .",
    "the bs equations are solved numerically under the covariant instantaneous approximation , which is suitable for the weakly bound states of both the heavy diquark and the doubly heavy baryon .",
    "the obtained masses of the doubly heavy baryons are consistent with those from the lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "it is found that the properties of both the heavy diquarks and the doubly heavy baryons are independent of their spin in the leading order of a @xmath0 expansion .",
    "as we know , the superflavor symmetry relates doubly heavy baryons to heavy mesons , and hence the form factors of the transitions of doubly heavy baryons are reduced to the isgur - wise function , which is well known for heavy mesons  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the doubly heavy baryon transitions is greatly simplified under the superflavor symmetry at the cost of ignoring the derivation from non - pointlike spatial dispersion of the heavy diquark . in this work ,",
    "we directly calculate the decay amplitudes for the doubly heavy baryons using the bs wave functions obtained for both the heavy diquark and the doubly heavy baryons , instead of employing the superflavor symmetry .",
    "we give the predictions for the non - leptonic decay widths of doubly heavy baryons emitting a pseudo - scalar meson .",
    "our results will be tested in the future experiments .    in our calculation , for the propagators of the heavy diquarks and the light quarks involved in the bound states , we simply assume the forms of free propagators with the masses of the heavy diquarks and the light quarks taken to be the constituent ones .",
    "actually , the real propagators should be solved using the dyson - schwinger equation .",
    "in such an approach , one has to guarantee the consistency between the kernel of the bs equation and that of the dyson - schwinger equation as required by the axial - vector ward - takahashi identity @xcite .",
    "this is a very complicated procedure and needs more careful investigations in the future .    at the hera - b and tevatron facilities more than @xmath98 events involving double charm baryons",
    "are expected , while at the lhc one can expect about @xmath99 events  @xcite .",
    "since the available energy at the lhc is much higher than the masses of @xmath100 and @xmath101 , it is believed that their production rates should be comparable .",
    "the decay widths of the doubly heavy baryons we present in this work will be tested in the forthcoming experiments .",
    "since the bs equations are established at the leading order in a @xmath0 expansion , we do not distinguish the different spins of both the heavy diquarks and the doubly heavy baryons .",
    "such differences should happen at @xmath102 .",
    "@xmath0 corrections will be studied in the future .",
