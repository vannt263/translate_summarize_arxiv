    "<S> + the random - phase approximation with second - order screened exchange ( rpa+sosex ) is a model of electron correlation energy with two caveats : its accuracy depends on an arbitrary choice of mean field , and it scales as @xmath0 operations and @xmath1 memory for @xmath2 electrons . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a new algorithm that reduces its scaling to @xmath1 operations and @xmath3 memory using controlled approximations and a new self - consistent field that approximates brueckner coupled - cluster doubles ( bccd ) theory with rpa+sosex , referred to as brueckner rpa ( brpa ) theory . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm comparably reduces the scaling of second - order mller - plesset ( mp2 ) perturbation theory with smaller cost prefactors than rpa+sosex . within a semiempirical model </S>",
    "<S> , we study h@xmath4 dissociation to test accuracy and h@xmath5 rings to verify scaling . </S>"
