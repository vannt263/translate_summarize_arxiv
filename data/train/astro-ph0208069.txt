    "@xmath0 , discovered by @xcite , is the nearest and brightest known neutron star not showing emission dominated by non - thermal magnetospheric processes . as such it offers a unique opportunity to study the bare thermal surface emission .",
    "measurements of the spectrum can probe the neutron star mass ( @xmath5 ) and radius ( @xmath6 ) , constraining the high density equation of state ( eos ) . since the discovery",
    ", there have been several intensive observing campaigns covering the optical - uv ( _ hst _ ) and most recently the detailed soft x - ray spectrum ( _ cxo _ ) . an initial @xmath7 low - energy transmission grating ( letg ) spectrum showed a broad band spectrum remarkably consistent with a simple blackbody @xcite , although hints of spectral features were suggested @xcite .",
    "a deeper observation using @xmath8 of director s discretionary time ( ddt ) was made .",
    "this unique data set has been the subject of prompt study ; several authors show that lines in the spectrum are undetectable , while pulse searches have placed stringent limits on the observed soft x - ray pulse fraction @xcite .",
    "these data have been variously interpreted , including the widely reported speculation ( based on the x - ray spectrum alone ) that @xmath0  might be a bare quark star ( esp .",
    "despite the very stringent constraints placed on the x - ray pulse fraction , ( @xmath9 at @xmath10 confidence , including a @xmath11 search * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there is strong evidence that @xmath0  is a rotation - powered pulsar .",
    "@xcite discovered an h@xmath12 nebula surrounding the neutron star , concluding that it could be best interpreted as a bow - shock nebula powered by a relativistic wind of @xmath13 generated by pulsar spindown .",
    "the bow shock geometry then provides an estimate of the spindown power @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "adopting magnetic dipole braking at constant @xmath15 , this gives @xmath16 for a surface dipole field @xmath17 and characteristic age @xmath18 , suggesting @xmath19 .",
    "a critical parameter in the discussion of this source is the distance , which has been the subject of some controversy .",
    "initial estimates from _ hst _  astrometry gave a parallax distance of @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "@xcite , however re - analyzed these data , deriving @xmath21 . a fourth _ hst _",
    "observation appears to have resolved this discrepancy , giving an overall measurement of @xmath22 @xcite ; we adopt this value .",
    "for some time now , it has been clear that the broad band spectrum of @xmath0  from _ hst _ , _ rosat _ , and _ euve _  data ( for a detailed discussion , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is inconsistent with a light element ( @xmath23 kramer s law opacity ) h or he atmospheres .",
    "h models , for example , overpredict the optical / x - ray flux ratio by a factor @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "blackbody , heavy element or composite models gave acceptable fits . to produce such @xmath23 planckian spectra",
    ", one must have nearly isothermal conditions at optical depth @xmath25 across the observed band .",
    "one possibility is that the surface is in a solid or liquid state , precluding large temperature gradients through the photosphere .",
    "theoretical studies to date , while limited , suggest that this is not the case unless h is present and @xmath26 @xcite . in an atmosphere ,",
    "the easiest way to form the spectrum in a small depth range is to invoke a rich line spectrum ; thus , at first sight , blackbody - like spectra should require a high spectral density of opacity features ( lines and edges ) .",
    "this led to the expectation that the blackbody - like spectrum of @xmath0  would show many spectral features when examined with good s / n letg spectra .",
    "unfortunately , the initial @xmath7 exposure already showed that the line features were substantially weaker than expected in a simple low-@xmath15 single temperature atmosphere model dominated by heavy elements .",
    "the new ddt exposure only enhances this conclusion , placing very strong limits ( typical equivalent width @xmath27 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on spectral features .",
    "we will be concerned with the quality of statistical fits to various atmosphere models .",
    "it is important to note here that blackbody spectral fits to the _ cxo _",
    "@xmath0  letg data are , contrary to early reports , _ not _ statistically perfect fits to a simple planck spectrum .",
    "this conclusion was drawn from fits to basic ciao extractions , which appreciably underbin the spectrum .",
    "instead we find that at a more modest binning ( equally spaced @xmath28bins ) we obtain @xmath29dof=1.6 . as the bin size",
    "is increased , the @xmath29dof grows to @xmath30 , until the number of degrees of freedom becomes small .",
    "this is a clear signature of spectral departures on resolved energy scales , and with appropriate binning one indeed finds systematic , grouped residuals to the planck function fit at the @xmath31% level .",
    "we believe that these represent the limit of accuracy in calibration of the response matrix , as the broad band spectral shape is an excellent fit to the planck function .",
    "@xcite have reached similar conclusions . recognizing that very subtle departures from a pure blackbody may be present in these data , we adopt the conservative assumption that these departures are fully accounted for by response matrix systematics .    to accommodate an extended atmosphere",
    ", one must suppress the spectral features .",
    "one possibility is that external heat sources ( such as precipitating magnetosphereic @xmath13 ) drive the atmosphere towards isothermality .",
    "sample atmospheres showing this effect have been computed in @xcite .",
    "a second possibility is that the line energies for a given species vary strongly across the neutron star surface . for normal pulsar fields , @xmath32 or higher , the strong dependence of the transition energies on the local @xmath15 ( _ eg .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , coupled with substantial @xmath33 variation of @xmath15 across the surface , even for the simplest dipole models , ensures that such ` magnetic smearing ' will strongly suppress the phase - averaged line width ( romani , in prep . ) .",
    "we discuss briefly here a third possibility , that the lines experience variable shifts as the pulsar rotates due to doppler and other dynamic effects .",
    "again , the phase - averaged spectrum observed for @xmath0  would be expected to show broadened and blended lines , driving the spectrum towards a planck curve .    if , as is required for a normal neutron star , the soft x - ray emission of @xmath0  is dominated by hot polar caps , the rotation of these past the line of sight produces phase dependent doppler shifts @xcite .",
    "these are only significant for @xmath34 , _",
    "@xmath35 a few ms . such small @xmath36 are not excluded , since the hrc - s wiring error limits arrival time accuracy and precludes sensitive searches for @xmath37 . moreover ,",
    "the @xmath38 from the bow shock standoff gives @xmath39 , so a low field star , having a non - magnetic atmosphere would have a @xmath40 spin period .    for a concrete example",
    ", we assume @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 ( allowed , as the existence of @xmath44 shows ) . we have tried both solar abundance and iron model atmospheres , tested a range of magnetic inclinations @xmath12 , and computed phase averaged spectra using an extension of the monte carlo simulation code described in @xcite .",
    "we then tested these models , fitting the most recent _ cxo _   data , allowing the temperature , observer viewing angle @xmath45 , and interstellar absorption @xmath46  to vary .",
    "the large l and m shell edges in the iron models ensure that these are always poor fits .",
    "the solar abundance atmospheres have a much richer line structure which is more easily blurred into a pseudo - continuum . in figure  [ solfit ] , we display the solar abundance millisecond pulsar model , overlaid on the _ cxo _  data .",
    "for comparison the best fit non - rotating model is shown in the upper panel .",
    "doppler boosting produces a qualitatively acceptable fit below @xmath47 , but the simple blackbody remains statistically an appreciably better model ( @xmath48/dof=1.6 _ vs. _  3.7 for the binning chosen ) .",
    "we must conclude that a simple blackbody fit remains the best available , although not yet physically explained .",
    "planck emission from a physical neutron star can be compared with the data to obtain significant constraints on the neutron star parameters ; we pursue this in the remainder of the paper .",
    "a blackbody fit to the _ cxo _  data alone results in a temperature of @xmath49 with very small statistical uncertainty ( * ? ? ? * and our own analysis ) .",
    "we find , as also reported by @xcite , that systematics ( likely in the the effective area , as noted above ) provide the dominant error .",
    "@xcite quote @xmath50 . taken at face value this @xmath51 with the parallax distance gives a radius as measured at infinity of @xmath52 .",
    "if interpreted as the full star radius , this demands exotic equations of state ( _ i.e. _  quark stars ) .",
    "of course , this is only a lower limit to the stellar radius .",
    "the optical / uv data points , which closely follow a rayleigh - jeans spectrum ( _ eg .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are most easily interpreted as a second cooler planck spectrum representing flux from the full surface .",
    "this has been previously recognized , but @xcite argue against this interpretation , citing the absence of the x - ray pulse expected from such a hot polar cap / cool surface combination .",
    "we have addressed this concern quantitatively , computing detailed light curves and spectra .",
    "a simple analytic two - temperature blackbody fit delineates the basic model parameters . for a range of effective ( cold surface )",
    "radii , we fit @xmath53 , @xmath54 , the hot area , and the absorption column density . in figure 2 , we plot the minimum @xmath48  as a function of cold radius .",
    "the optical - uv data points fix @xmath55 .",
    "the fit becomes poor when @xmath54 starts to allow significant wien peak contribution to the _ cxo _  x - ray band ; this sets the minimum stellar radius .",
    "formally , there is a maximum acceptable radius beyond which low @xmath54 predicts wien peak curvature inconsistent with the @xmath23rayleigh - jeans uv data points .",
    "[ chi ]      in addition to the phase averaged spectrum , we have a limit on the _ cxo_-band pulse fraction . a more realistic model is required to address the detailed spectrum and pulsations .",
    "we adopt a two - temperature model with two opposing hot spots ( polar caps ) at @xmath53 and the remainder of the surface at @xmath54 .",
    "the caps orientation ( @xmath12 and @xmath45 ) are free parameters .",
    "we radiate from these surfaces , tracing the photons to infinity to form phase resolved spectra and light curves . for details of these monte - carlo sums",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the analytic model results allow some useful simplifications .",
    "since @xmath53 is virtually constant over the full acceptable @xmath56 range , we fix this value in exploring the rest of the parameter space .",
    "further , the x - ray flux amplitude allows an initial estimate of the cap half angle @xmath57 ( which depends on @xmath12 and @xmath45 ) that ensures that the pulse formation is accurate and results in quick convergence to the true minimum .",
    "the fit parameters of interest are @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath54 , @xmath45 , @xmath12 , and @xmath58 . to explore the sensitivity to several parameters ,",
    "we have computed a model grid .",
    "we calculate all models for @xmath59 to @xmath60 in five degree steps ; @xmath61 to @xmath62 in five degree steps ; and @xmath63 to @xmath64 in one kilometer steps . while not strictly a fit parameter , we also vary the stellar mass @xmath65 .",
    "the quality of the spectral fit turns out to be quite insensitive to the choice of @xmath12 and @xmath45 . in figure 3",
    ", we display a typical spectrum for a model with @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "as the radius becomes smaller , the optical - uv flux is under - predicted and the fit becomes unacceptable .    [ specfit ]    for each @xmath12 and @xmath45 we compute @xmath48  as a function of @xmath56 . the average over angles",
    "is shown by the points in figure 2 .",
    "note that the minimum value is not at @xmath68 , a consequence of the aforementioned systematic errors .",
    "this means that the errors are not poisson distributed according to the bin counts . to establish confidence levels ( cl )",
    ", we must monte carlo according to the observed error distribution .",
    "we have computed the @xmath48  distribution about the best fit model for each ( @xmath12 , @xmath45 ) combination , obtaining a histogram of @xmath48  values . these were almost completely insensitive to the angles , so we combined all the @xmath48  distributions to obtain confidence levels to the @xmath48  increases associated with variations in @xmath6",
    ". examinations of the differences between the different angles and between independent monte carlo runs show that the estimates of 90% and 99% confidence level limits on the radius are uncertain by no more than @xmath69 from systematic and computational errors in this procedure .",
    "one might question whether a simple , circular uniform @xmath53 polar cap is merely an adequate approximation to the data .",
    "we have fit some alternative surface temperature distributions @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the magnetic co - latitude , comparing with the best fit circular cap which had @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "the best fit gaussian @xmath70 had a peak temperature of @xmath74 and width @xmath75 , but showed an increase of @xmath76 over the simple cap model , sufficient to exclude at the @xmath77% cl . adding a simple linear @xmath53 to @xmath54 ramp to a uniform cap makes no discernible difference until the ramp width is twice that of the cap . at this point",
    "the best fit model has a cap with @xmath78 and @xmath79 , but the model is excluded at the @xmath80% cl .",
    "finally , we fit both a simple @xmath81 model and the surface @xmath70 distribution of @xcite which is motivated by magnetic anisotropy in the thermal conductivity .",
    "both were excluded by the _ cxo _",
    "data at very high confidence .",
    "all fits were at @xmath82 , best fit stellar radii and ( @xmath12 , @xmath45 ) chosen so that the pulse fraction is @xmath83 for the default cap model .",
    "evidently , the _ cxo _  data require a quite uniform distribution of the high temperature excess , and suggests that it is induced by exterior heating rather than interior conductivity .",
    "this cap size is substantially larger than the @xmath84 expected for a dipole surface cap , unless the period is very small .",
    "higher magnetic multipoles would generally have even smaller open zone caps .",
    "the large , uniformly heated area is puzzling in the context of pulsar surface acceleration models , but might be most easily accommodated in the more modern pictures of a gr - induced potential that is relatively uniform across the polar cap and forms a pair formation front at relatively high altitudes @xcite .",
    "perhaps a more plausible interpretation invokes a high - altitude acceleration zone , with the inward - directed @xmath85-rays pair converting in the closed zone above the polar cap @xcite , which should give a @xmath23 large zone of uniform surface heating .",
    "we have seen that the spectral fits are quite insensitive to the cap viewing angles .",
    "they place a firm minimum on the allowed @xmath6  but allow radii that are implausibly large .",
    "however , the observed pulse fraction depends strongly on viewing geometry and , through gravitational focusing , the value of @xmath86 . in general",
    ", we expect a strong x - ray pulse when the magnetic axis passes close to earth s line - of - sight ( small @xmath87 )",
    ". of course , for an aligned rotator @xmath88 the pulse can be very small and for @xmath89 there is an appreciable region where the pulse is weak as viewed from earth .",
    "we have examined the _",
    "cxo_-band pulse profile of our model grid to find the allowed region of @xmath90 parameter space in which the model pulse fraction is weaker than that observed ( @xmath91 ) ; this is shown in the inset of figure  [ skycoverage ] .",
    "this exercise is repeated for each @xmath92 ; the allowed phase space is larger for small @xmath93 as gravitational bending dilutes the observed pulse . by demanding a certain minimum probability that a pulse fraction as low as that observed is seen at earth",
    ", we obtain a _ maximum _",
    "acceptable radius for the neutron star .",
    "one important additional constraint can be invoked .",
    "the non - detection of this neutron star in the radio band @xcite puts a very strong bound on pulsar emission directed towards earth . assuming that this is a normal radio pulsar ( consistent with @xmath38 inferred from the bow shock )",
    ", we must conclude _ a priori _ ( independent of the x - ray data ) that our line of sight lies outside of the pulsar radio beam and that @xmath87 is not small .",
    "the region excluded depends on the size of the radio beam ( @xmath94 ) , which in turn depends on the spin period .",
    "a typical estimate is ( _ eg . _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath95 at the radio frequency @xmath96  ghz . with @xmath97 ,",
    "this gives @xmath98 .",
    "radio limits on @xmath0  are strong at even lower @xmath99 where radius - to - frequency mapping produces larger @xmath100 , and for this nearby object , the radio luminosity constraints are so severe that we are unlikely to intersect even the faint fringe of the radio beam .",
    "both effects argue for @xmath100 larger than that above . accordingly , in the figure  [ skycoverage ] inset we show by diagonal lines the regions near @xmath101 excluded by the lack of radio detection for @xmath102 and @xmath103 this fiducial beam size .",
    "shorter periods allow an _ a priori _ exclusion of even more phase space .",
    "the point is that from the lack of radio detection we should have _ expected _ a low x - ray pulse fraction .",
    "the probability for obtaining pulses as weak as observed is then set by the fraction of the remaining allowed solid angle .",
    "these fractions are plotted in figure  [ skycoverage ] with and without the radio prior .",
    "the allowed radius range depends on mass and in table  [ tbl - pf ] , we give the 90% and 99% cl upper bound on the neutron star radius for these priors and several neutron star masses .",
    "[ skycoverage ]",
    "we see that the x - ray / optical data , using the spectral and pulse fraction arguments , give a range of allowed stellar radii for each mass . strictly speaking ,",
    "the minimum and maximum radius cl have somewhat different interpretations , but it is interesting to place these bounds in the @xmath104 plane to compare with the predictions of various eos .    in figure  [ eosconstraint ] , we show the combined constraints , assuming @xmath105 . the spectral radius lower bounds at 90% and 99% cl approximate curves of constant @xmath86 . the pulse fraction upper bounds ( 90% , 95% ) rapidly drive one to small radii at low masses .",
    "for @xmath106 no simultaneous solutions are allowed consistent with the 90% bounds . at @xmath2",
    "the allowed range from the fit is quite small , @xmath3 .",
    "the additional uncertainty in the distance actually dominates the errors ( arrowed bar ) .    for comparison , several eos curves ( after * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are plotted .",
    "we see that large radius ( stiff at nuclear density ) eos are preferred . formally , the relativistic field theoretical model by @xcite and the model gs2 by @xcite are the only modern models allowed ( the original ps model of @xcite is also allowed ) .",
    "we note that the gs models are very sensitive to the k meson potential ; for example , gs1 is strongly excluded .",
    "interestingly , no potential or variational method computations agree with the formal overlap .",
    "if one includes the distance uncertainty , a few more intermediate radius models are not excluded at the 90% cl . however , even including the distance uncertainties , all quark star models are excluded at the @xmath107% level for @xmath108 and are only barely consistent at the highest allowed masses . improved _ hst _",
    "parallax measurements could boost this exclusion to the 3@xmath109 level .",
    "the model gs2 differs from the ms models in that it includes a kaon condensate in the core .",
    "one principal effect of exotic interior condensates is to enhance neutrino cooling after @xmath110 .",
    "this can also be achieved without exotica for a proton fraction @xmath111 through the direct urca process @xcite .",
    "our inferred @xmath54 , interpreted as the signature of the cooling from the initial heat of formation , corresponds to @xmath112 for our best fit radius .",
    "such luminosities are reached in @xmath113 ( the preferred age of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) when enhanced neutrino cooling can occur , but are achieved after @xmath114 for stars with low density ( stiff ) cores @xcite .",
    "thus , depending on the actual stellar age , this cool surface may be seen as weak evidence for an exotic composition and/or significant softening of the eos at very high densities .",
    "the prospects for further tests of the ideas in this paper hinge on the detection of a pulse from @xmath0  along with measurement of the pulse fraction and the period derivative . given that significant allowed pulse fraction parameter space lies just slightly below the _ cxo _  letg detection threshold , the prospects for a pulse measurement with the recently completed @xmath115 _ xmm _  observation are quite good . even if only thermal , the phase resolved spectrum should provide important constraints on the cap temperature , size and orientation .",
    "in particular our thermal model predicts that the pulse fraction should increase by 70% from @xmath116 to @xmath117 , where the _ xmm _  data should still deliver @xmath118  pn camera cps , allowing detection of pulse fractions well under 1% .",
