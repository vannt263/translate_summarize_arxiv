    "fast nuclear gas outflows appear to be a relatively common phenomena in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . they have been detected - using optical , uv and x - ray observations - in seyfert galaxies ( see for some examples crenshaw et al .",
    "2000 ; aoki et al .  1996 ; capetti et al . 1999 and",
    "refs therein ) , quasars ( see e.g.  turnshek 1986 , krongold et al.2003 and refs therein ) , but also in starburst galaxies ( veilleux et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "these gas outflows can have different origins , such as being jet - driven ( if the object is radio loud ) or related to starburst and agn winds .",
    "why should we expect gas outflows also in radio galaxies ?",
    "in these objects all the potential drivers for powerful outflows ( a highly luminous ionising agn , relativistic jets and , often , a starburst ) are present to varying degrees . in particular , the activity - inducing processes ( e.g.  merger , interaction ) are believed to involve the injection of substantial amounts of gas / dust into the central nuclear regions .",
    "thus , we can expect that in the first phase ( or in a re - started phase ) of activity , strong interactions with the relatively dense medium will occur .",
    "indeed , gas outflows are now increasingly detected in radio galaxies and here we present a summary of the results we have obtained so far in our study of both the ionized , as well as the neutral , components of such outflows .",
    "the first clear example of an outflow of ionized gas that we have found is in the southern _ starburst _ radio galaxy pks  154979 ( i.e.  a radio galaxy that spectroscopically shows a young stellar population component in addition to the old stellar component typical of elliptical galaxies ) . in pks  154979 , different redshift systems associated with both",
    "the low- and high - ionisation emission lines were found ( tadhunter et al .",
    "the high ionisation lines are broader , with fwhm@xmath2 @xmath0km@xmath0s@xmath1  while the low - ionisation lines are narrower .",
    "the  absorption detected in this object ( morganti et al .",
    "2001 ) has the same redshift as the low ionisation gas , while the high ionisation gas appears blueshifted with respect to it .",
    "the  absorption and the low ionisation gas are associated with a cocoon of material surrounding the tiny ( @xmath3 pc in size ) radio source . on the other hand ,",
    "the high ionisation ( and blueshifted ) gas is believed to be associated with an outflow from a region close to the radio jet and disturbed by it . taken together , all these results are consistent with the idea that pks  154979 is a young radio source in which the cocoon of debris left over from the event that triggered the activity has not yet been swept aside by circumnuclear outflows .",
    "more recently , bellamy et al .  (",
    "2003 ) have detected broad pa@xmath4 in pks  154979 confirming that this object indeed contains a quasar nucleus that is moderately extinguished , despite evidence that its radio jet points close to our line - of - sight .",
    "an even more extreme case of gas outflow has been found in the radio galaxy 4c  12.50 ( pks  1345 + 12 ) . this is a particularly interesting object as it is a prime candidate for the link between ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , sanders & mirabel 1996 ) and radio galaxies ( evans et al .",
    "the radio source is confined to a region @xmath5 arcsec ( @xmath6 pc ) and has all the characteristics of young radio sources ( @xmath7 yr ) .",
    "the ism of this radio galaxy is extremely rich : it is the brightest far - ir radio galaxy and has a high molecular gas mass ( evans et al .",
    "long slit spectra were taken ( using the wht , see holt et al .",
    "2003 for details ) in order to investigate the impact of the nuclear activity on the circumnuclear interstellar medium .",
    "the spectra show extended line emission up to @xmath8 kpc from the nucleus , consistent with the presence of an asymmetric halo of diffuse emission as observed in optical and infrared images .    at the position of the nucleus ,",
    "complex emission line profiles are observed and gaussian fits to the [ oiii ] emission lines ( see fig .  1 _ left _ ) require three components ( narrow , intermediate and broad ) , the broadest of which has fwhm@xmath9 @xmath0km@xmath0s@xmath1  and is blueshifted by @xmath9 @xmath0km@xmath0s@xmath1  with respect to the halo of the galaxy and the deep and narrow  absorption .",
    "this component is interpreted as material in outflow .",
    "a large reddening and high density ( @xmath10 4200 @xmath11 ) has also been found for the most kinematically disturbed component .",
    "4c  12.50 , like pks  1549 - 79 , appears , therefore , to be a young radio galaxy with nuclear regions that are still enshrouded in a dense cocoon of gas and dust .",
    "the radio jets are now expanding through this cocoon , sweeping material out of the nuclear regions ( holt et al .",
    "extremely intriguing is the discovery of a number of radio galaxies where the presence of fast outflows is associated not only with ionized but also with _ neutral _ gas .",
    "this finding gives new and important insights on the physical conditions of the gaseous medium around an agn .",
    "the best example found so far of this phenomenon is the radio galaxy 3c  293 ( morganti et al .",
    "2003a ) . in this galaxy",
    ", very broad absorption has been detected against the central regions - this is in addition to the known and much narrower absorption ; haschick & baan 1985 , beswick et al .",
    "the absorption profile , obtained using the new broad band ( 20  mhz ) system available at the westerbork synthesis radio telescope , has a full width at zero intensity of about 1400 @xmath0km@xmath0s@xmath1  and most of this broad absorption ( @xmath12 @xmath0km@xmath0s@xmath1 ) is blueshifted relative to the systemic velocity .",
    "the broad absorption is shallow ( the optical depth is only @xmath13 % ) and corresponds to a column density of the  of @xmath14 k @xmath15 .",
    "this is likely to be a lower limit to the true column density as the @xmath16 associated with such a fast outflow can be as large as a few 1000  k ( instead of 100  k which is more typical of the cold , quiescent  in galaxy disks ) .",
    "this absorption represents a fast outflow of _ neutral _ gas from the central regions of this agn .",
    "new optical spectra ( see fig .  2b , from emonts et al .  in prep .",
    ") show that the optical emission lines also contain a broad component that is very similar to the broad  absorption .",
    "this suggests that the  and ionized gas outflows may be coming from the same physical region .",
    "the radio galaxy 4c  12.50 also shows broad  absorption ( shown in fig .",
    "1b ) when observed using a broad radio band .",
    "the absorption appears complex and _ extremely broad_. the full range of velocities covered by the  absorption is @xmath9 @xmath0km@xmath0s@xmath1 , _ the broadest detected so far in _ .",
    "the peak optical depth of the broad component is only @xmath17 and the column density of the full system of shallow  absorption ( assuming a covering factor is 1 ) is @xmath18 @xmath15 .      the central question is how _ neutral _ gas can be associated with such fast outflows .",
    "as discussed in morganti et al .",
    "( 2003a ) for 3c  293 , a number of possible hypotheses can be made about the origin of such outflows .",
    "they include , e.g. , starburst winds ( veilleux et al . 2002 ) , radiation pressure from the agn ( dopita et al .",
    "2002 ) , jet - driven outflow and adiabatically expanding broad emission line clouds ( elvis et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the model that we favour is jet - driven outflow , although we can not rule out that one of the other mechanisms is also at work at some level .",
    "this model assumes that the radio plasma jet hits a ( molecular ) cloud in the ism . as a consequence of this interaction ,",
    "the kinematics of the gas are disturbed by the shocks and the gas is ionized by it . once the shock has passed , part of the gas may have the chance to recombine and become neutral while it is moving at high velocities .",
    "one problem with this model ( considered in detail by mellema et al .",
    "2002 ) is that it may not be possible to accelerate the clouds of gas to the high velocities that we observe , as indicated by e.g.  the simulations presented by van breugel ( these proceedings ) .    to understand which is the more likely mechanism ,",
    "we now need high spatial resolution observations to find the exact position of the absorption .",
    "so far this information is available only for the seyfert galaxy ic  5063 where it is providing evidence that the interaction between the radio jet and a molecular cloud is indeed the cause of the gas outflow .",
    "the southern seyfert galaxy ic  5063 was the first agn where a fast outflow of neutral hydrogen was detected ( morganti et al .",
    "vlbi observations have confirmed that the broad absorption is detected against the bright radio lobe ( i.e.  _ not _ against the nucleus ) situated at @xmath19 kpc from the nucleus , as shown in fig .",
    "3a ( see also oosterloo et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "deep optical spectra have been taken with the eso - ntt to compare the kinematics of the ionized gas with that of the neutral hydrogen component in order to study the mechanism that could drive this outflow .",
    "preliminary results are presented in morganti et al .",
    "( 2003b ) .",
    "the data reveal extremely complex gas kinematics as can be seen in fig .",
    "this includes the presence of an outflow of ionised gas ( with velocities of several hundred km / s ) at the location of the brighter radio lobe .",
    "the amplitude of this outflow is strikingly similar to that of the .",
    "because of its location , we consider the interaction between the radio jet and the ism to be the most likely mechanism for the extreme kinematics .",
    "our observations show that gas outflows of both ionized gas and neutral hydrogen are found in some radio galaxies .",
    "so far the indications are that these outflows are present in objects that are either in the early - stage of their evolution ( like 4c  12.50 ) or , perhaps , in a phase of re - started activity ( as we think it is the case for 3c  293 ) . moreover ,",
    "another characteristic that appears to be common among these objects is the presence of a young stellar population component ( tadhunter et al .",
    "+ although it is difficult to attribute the outflow to a starburst wind ( as the young stellar population is usually relatively old , 0.5 - 2 gyr ) , the presence of such a young stellar component could be an indication that the galaxy is indeed in a particular stage of its evolution , where large amounts of gas / dust - likely from the merger that triggered the activity - are still present in the inner region and the radio jet is strongly interacting with it . +",
    "a more systematic search for fast gas outflows in radio galaxies is now in progress .",
