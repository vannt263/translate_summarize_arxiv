    "sm a very successful theory of the electroweak interactions .",
    "but it should not be the final theory .",
    "theoretically , it has too many unknown parameters to be put by hand and can not unify the three gauge interactions .",
    "also , sm has been faced to some troubles from the experiments .",
    "we need the new physics beyond sm .",
    "many new physics models have been proposed to resolve the difficulties of sm and to explain the experiments .",
    "of course , they have to be tested in many high energy experiments , such as the rare decays of mesons .",
    "the startup of the lhc opens many new frontiers in precision flavour physics .",
    "as is well known , the rare radiative decays of b mesons are particularly sensitive to the contributions from new physics .",
    "both inclusive and exclusive processes have been researched in the last 20 years .",
    "for example , @xmath7 has been studied extensively in the sm@xcite and new physics scenarios@xcite .",
    "the present experimental limit on the decay @xmath8",
    "@xciteis @xmath9 within the sm one finds@xcite , @xmath10 the upper bound of @xmath8 is about @xmath11 larger than the sm values .",
    "we believe , with the continuous accumulate of the experiment data , especially in the era of lhc and ilc , these branching ratios will be more and more precise",
    ". they will leave less room for the new physics .",
    "that is to say , @xmath8 , is very suitable to test the new physics models .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we investigated the new physical effects on @xmath12 in the one generation technicolor model ( ogtm ) and got some interesting results . in this note , we consider the sequential fourth generation model@xcite to estimate the possible contributions to the decay @xmath13 .",
    "recently , sm4 attracts an increasing interest and seems warming up .",
    "the electroweak precision data does not exclude completely existence of the fourth family and there are many reasons to introduce an extra generation of heavy particles@xcite , ( for a recent brief review on the 4th generation , see @xcite ) .",
    "especially , lhc has the potential to discover or fully exclude existence of a fourth generation of quarks up to 1 tev@xcite , even if they are too heavy to observe directly they will induce a large signal in @xmath14 that will be clearly visible at the lhc@xcite .",
    "maybe this model will be firstly tested by the early lhc data .",
    "the sequential fourth generation model is a simple and non - supersymmetric extension of the sm , which does not add any new dynamics to the sm , with an additional up - type @xmath15 and an down - type @xmath16 quarks , a heavy charged lepton@xmath17 and a heavy neutrino @xmath18 .",
    "the model retains all the properties of the sm .",
    "the @xmath15 quark like the other up - type quarks contribute to the @xmath19 transition at the loop level .",
    "due to the additional fourth generation there will be mixing between the @xmath15 quark the three down - type quarks of the standard model and the resulting mixing matrix will become a @xmath3 matrix , @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the new matrix elements in the sm4 .",
    "the parametrization of this unitary matrix requires six mixing angles and three phases@xcite .",
    "at quark level , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and the exclusive decays @xmath25 have a close relation . up to the corrections of order",
    "@xmath26 , the effective hamiltonian for @xmath27 at scales @xmath28 is identical to the one for @xmath29 transition @xcite and takes the form    @xmath30 , \\label{eq : heff }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath31 are the usual four - fermion operators whose explicit form is given below .",
    "the last two operators in the eq.([eq : heff ] ) , characteristic for this decay , are the _",
    "magnetic  penguin _ operators . the complete list of operators is given as follows @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are color indices , @xmath35 labels @xmath36 generators , @xmath37 and @xmath38 refer to the electromagnetic and strong coupling constants , while @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote the qed and qcd field strength tensors , respectively .",
    "it is the magnetic @xmath41-penguin operator @xmath42 , which plays the crucial role in this decay .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for @xmath43 is obtained from eqs.([eq : heff]-[eq : o8 g ] ) by the replacement @xmath44 .    the feynman diagrams that contribute to the matrix element as the following ,",
    "[ fig1 ] ,    ]    within the sm , at scale @xmath45 , the wilson coefficients @xmath46 at the leading order ( lo ) approximation have been given for example in @xcite , @xmath47 , \\label{eq : c7mw}\\\\ c_8(m_w ) & = & \\frac{x_t^3- 5x_t^2 - 2 x_t    } { 8(1-x_t)^3 } - \\frac { 3 x_t^2 } { 4(1-x_t)^4}\\log[x_t ] , \\label{eq : c8mw }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 .    by using qcd renormalization group equations@xcite",
    ", it is straightforward to run wilson coefficients @xmath46 from the scale @xmath49 down to the lower scale @xmath50 .",
    "the leading order results for the wilson coefficients @xmath51 with @xmath52 are of the form @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 in the sequential 4th generation model , there exists an additional contribution to @xmath56 induced by the 4th generation up quark @xmath57 , which produce the penguin diagrams , see fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) ,     quark.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the new wilson coefficients contributed by @xmath57 are same as their counterparts in eq .",
    "( [ eq : c7mw ] ) and ( [ eq : c8mw ] ) except for exchanging @xmath57 quark not @xmath58 quark .    at the mass scale of @xmath59 , the wilson coefficients of the dipole operators",
    "are given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are two elements of the @xmath63 ckm matrix .",
    "we recall here that the ckm coefficient corresponding to the @xmath58 quark contribution , i.e. , @xmath64 , is factorized in the effective hamiltonian as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : heff ] ) .    to calculate @xmath8 ,",
    "one may follow a perturbative qcd approach which includes a proof of factorization , showing that soft gluon effects can be factorized into @xmath65 meson wave function ; and a systematic way of resuming large logarithms due to hard gluons with energies between 1gev and @xmath66 . in order to calculate the matrix element of eq(1 ) for the @xmath8",
    ", we can work in the weak binding approximation and assume that both the @xmath67 and the @xmath68 quarks are at rest in the @xmath69 meson , and the @xmath67 quarks carries most of the meson energy , and its four velocity can be treated as equal to that of @xmath69 .",
    "hence one may write @xmath67 quark momentum as @xmath70 where is the common four velocity of @xmath67 and @xmath65 .",
    "we have @xmath71 we compute the amplitude of @xmath8 using the following relations @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the @xmath65 meson decay constant .",
    "the total amplitude is now separated into a cp - even and a cp - odd part @xmath74 we find that    @xmath75    with @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , \\nonumber \\\\ a_c & = & ( c_1+c_3-c_5)n_c+(c_2+c_4-c_6 ) , \\nonumber \\\\ a_s & = & \\frac{1}{4 } \\left[(c_3+c_4-c_5)n_c+(c_3+c_4-c_6)\\right],\\nonumber \\\\ a_b & = & a_s.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the functions @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are defined by @xmath82 with @xmath83 the decay width for @xmath13 is simply @xmath84",
    "in the numerical calculations we use as input parameters @xmath85 , , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively .    for the mass limit of @xmath57 , cdf gives @xmath98 for the @xmath99 final state @xcite .",
    "the experimental upper bounds for the fourth family quark ckm matrix elements are @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 @xcite . by taking the ckm unitarity conditions , @xmath103 and the present measurement of @xmath104 ckm matrix@xcite , we obtain the bounds for the ckm4 matrix elements in sm4 , @xmath105a shows the dependence of @xmath106 with the ckm4 matrix factor @xmath5 for different values of @xmath2 .",
    "we can see that the new physics contributions can lead to appreciable changes of the sm predictions which may be enhanced by about more than one orders of magnitude in a reason- able mass range for @xmath57 .",
    "the new physics effects is very sensitive to the value of @xmath5 and becomes tiny as @xmath107 .",
    "it mains that @xmath108 can give the great limit room for the ckm4 matrix elements and give the strong constrict for the contributions to cp violation in sm4 .",
    "but from fig .",
    "[ fig3]a , the new physics effects is not sensitive to the mass of @xmath57 .",
    "this can be seen more clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b , which shows the mass dependence of @xmath106 with @xmath57 for different values of @xmath2 . from fig .",
    "[ fig3]b , we can see that the new physics effects become bigger with increasing mass of the @xmath57 .",
    "this is similar to the case of top quark to the rare @xmath109 meson decays in sm , which the main contributions come from the heavy quark .",
    "versus ( a ) ckm4 matrix factor @xmath110 for different values of @xmath2 ; ( b ) the mass of @xmath57 for different values of @xmath110.,title=\"fig : \" ]   versus ( a ) ckm4 matrix factor @xmath110 for different values of @xmath2 ; ( b ) the mass of @xmath57 for different values of @xmath110.,title=\"fig : \" ]     versus ( a ) ckm4 matrix factor @xmath111 for different values of @xmath2 ; ( b ) the mass of @xmath57 for different values of @xmath111.,title=\"fig : \" ]   versus ( a ) ckm4 matrix factor @xmath111 for different values of @xmath2 ; ( b ) the mass of @xmath57 for different values of @xmath111.,title=\"fig : \" ]    figs .

    "we can get the similar analysis but the new physics effects is much more sensitive to the value of the ckm4 matrix factor , @xmath4 .",
    "for both of these decays , the ckm4 matrix elements provides the dominant new physics contribution .    as a conclusion , the new physics contribution to the rare decay of @xmath113 in the sequential fourth can enhance rather large in magnitude , and may be detected in the near future precision experiments .",
