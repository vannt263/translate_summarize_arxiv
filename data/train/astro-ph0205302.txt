    "extensive air showers ( eas ) generated by cosmic rays in the earth s atmosphere are the only way to study cosmic rays of energies above @xmath0 ev . at lower energies",
    "the cosmic ray spectrum and composition are studied in experiments that measure directly the charge and energy of the primary particle .",
    "the analysis of air shower data relies on simulations that use the current knowledge of hadronic interactions to predict the observable shower parameters . with increasing cosmic ray energy ,",
    "this task becomes more difficult as the gap between the shower energy and the energy range studied in accelerator experiments increases and the hadronic interaction properties have to be extrapolated over a wide range .",
    "the difficulties are also related to the fact that particles produced in the forward region of the interaction are not registered in collider experiments , while they are responsible for most of the shower characteristics .",
    "last but not least , the atmospheric targets are light nuclei which have not been studied in collider experiments .",
    "air shower experiments are either ground arrays of detectors that trigger in coincidence when the shower passes through them , or optical detectors that observe the longitudinal development of eas .",
    "both types of instruments are sometimes supplemented by shielded or underground detectors that observe the muon component of the showers .",
    "the most commonly observed eas parameters are the number of charged particles at ground level for the shower arrays , or at shower maximum ( @xmath1 ) for the optical detectors ; the depth of shower maximum ( @xmath2 ) itself , and the number of muons ( @xmath3 ) above different energy thresholds . the combination of these and occasionally additional shower features , calculated in simulations with a particular hadronic model , is used as the basis for the determination of the energy and mass of the primary particle .",
    "reviews of air shower experiments and observed features are given , for example , in @xcite .",
    "at the end of the cosmic ray spectrum , at energies above 10@xmath4 ev , air shower simulation becomes a very difficult problem technically .",
    "the number of charged particles that have to be followed in the monte carlo scheme is proportional to the shower energy .",
    "for example , highest energy cosmic ray showers  @xcite can have more than @xmath5 charged particles at @xmath2 . as",
    "a consequence the direct simulation of the shower following each individual particle becomes practically impossible , especially when a large number of showers has to be simulated .",
    "the widely used solution to the problem of having to deal with an excessively large number of shower particles is the simulation of eas using the thinning technique @xcite .",
    "this method is extremely useful to estimate detectable signals and to compute average values of the observables @xcite .",
    "the thinning procedure follows only a subset of the shower particles below a certain energy threshold , assigning weights to them so that the average number of particles at the ground is correctly reproduced . due to this",
    ", artificial fluctuations are introduced even when small energy thresholds are used .",
    "various methods of reducing artificial fluctuations have been proposed recently ( e.g. @xcite ) optimizing the compromise between time - consuming simulations and fluctuation - enhancing thinning .    in this work we present a hybrid method of simulating the longitudinal profile of extensive air showers .",
    "it is a fast , one dimensional calculation which provides predictions for the total number of charged particles and muons along the shower axis .",
    "the method allows the collection of sufficiently high monte carlo statistics without losing information about shower fluctuations .",
    "in general , hybrid calculations are based on the idea to follow the development of air showers in detail above a certain energy threshold and to replace subthreshold particles by a simplified and efficient approximation of the subshowers initiated by them .",
    "many hybrid calculations use the monte carlo - generated high - energy secondary particles of the first few interactions of a cosmic ray in the atmosphere as initial distribution , and then calculate the particle densities observed at detector level by solving the corresponding transport equations ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    here",
    "we follow the approach of gaisser et al . @xcite and treat the subthreshold particles with a library of shower profiles based on presimulated pion - initiated showers .",
    "this idea can be combined in a bootstrap procedure  @xcite to extend the shower library to high energy .",
    "the novelty of this work is that we extend the method of @xcite by accounting for fluctuations in the subshowers generated with the shower library , and also calculate the number of muons at detector level above several energy thresholds .",
    "showers simulated in this way can be used as input to simulations for experiments measuring the longitudinal development of the shower such as hires  @xcite , the fluorescence detector of the pierre auger observatory  @xcite and future experiments such as euso  @xcite , owl / airwatch  @xcite and the telescope array  @xcite . besides this , as will become clear later , hybrid simulations are very helpful for comparing shower parameters predicted by different hadronic interaction models and to aid the interpretation of the experimental results in this way .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section  [ hybridmethod ] we describe the hybrid method and the parametrizations of the presimulated showers .",
    "we demonstrate the self - consistency of the method by comparing showers simulated directly with predictions from the hybrid calculation . in section  [ resultsprotons ]",
    "we apply the hybrid method to proton induced showers at fixed energy .",
    "we give the average values and distributions of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 obtained for different hadronic models and discuss how the differences are related to the simulation of high - energy multiparticle production .",
    "in addition the elongation rate theorem @xcite is discussed in terms of the different hadronic interaction models and their influence on the position of the shower maximum .",
    "where available , we compare our predictions to calculations performed with the corsika code  @xcite which uses the thinning approach .",
    "section  [ summary ] summarizes our results and concludes the paper .",
    "the hybrid method used in this work consists of calculating shower observables by a direct simulation of the initial part of the shower , tracking all particles of energy @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the primary energy and @xmath11 is an appropriate fraction of it ( in the following we use @xmath11 = 0.01 ) .",
    "then presimulated showers for all subthreshold particles are superimposed after their first interaction point is simulated .",
    "the subshowers are described with parametrizations that give the correct average behavior and at the same time describe the fluctuations in shower development .",
    "the method is extended recursively to higher energies by bootstrapping .",
    "the results obtained at any primary energy can then be used for the simulation of showers at higher energy .",
    "it is well known that the fluctuations in shower properties are dominated by fluctuations in the earliest and most energetic part of the cascade .",
    "we however parametrize both the average behavior and the shower fluctuations starting at 10 gev . in this way we can use the hybrid method at relatively low energy of 100  1000 tev , where the results can be compared to those of direct ( fully simulated ) shower calculations .",
    "we build a library of presimulated showers by injecting pions of fixed energy @xmath12 , at fixed zenith angle @xmath13 and depth @xmath14 measured along the shower axis .",
    "the atmospheric density adopted here corresponds to shibata s fit of the us standard atmosphere  @xcite , very similar to linsley s parametrization .",
    "we limit the injection zenith angles to @xmath15 since mainly showers in this angular range have been used for studies of the cosmic ray energy spectrum at the highest energies .",
    "nucleon initiated showers are not presimulated .",
    "nucleons are followed explicitly in the monte carlo down to the energy threshold for particle production .",
    "a subshower initiated by a kaon is assumed to be similar to one initiated by a pion of the same energy but with a different first interaction point , which is sampled from the corresponding interaction length distribution .",
    "this approximation is not expected to affect significantly our final results , the main reasons being the similarity between pion and kaon induced showers at high energy combined with the fact that the main contribution to shower development in this method comes from the highest energy particles that enter the parametrizations .",
    "unstable particles , including @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are allowed to interact or decay in the code .",
    "the interaction of these particles becomes important at the highest energies and accounting for them can influence the average values of some observables .",
    "photon and electron / positron induced cascades are treated with a full screening electromagnetic monte carlo in combination with a modified greisen parametrization .",
    "the electromagnetic branch of the monte carlo includes photoproduction of hadrons . for energies above 1 eev ,",
    "the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect  @xcite is taken into account using an implementation by vankov  @xcite .",
    "the influence of the geomagnetic field on the cascade development  @xcite is neglected .     and @xmath21 for 5,000 pion induced showers at primary energy @xmath22 ev initiated at @xmath23 g/@xmath24 and zenith angle @xmath25 .",

    "these values are used to produce distributions of showers in @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the correlations between them and distributions of the number of muons at sea level .",

    "correlations similar to these are produced for each entry in the library .",
    "their correct representation is crucial for the successful modeling of shower fluctuations .",
    "although it is unlikely to produce a high energy pion deep in the atmosphere , we also calculate their interactions at depths as large as 500 and 800 @xmath33 to obtain an accurate description of the muon numbers at sea level and a better description of the late developing electromagnetic showers . for showers initiated after @xmath34 the atmosphere",
    "has been artificially extended beyond ground level .",
    "the distributions of muons are easily extended to other depths ( corresponding to the observation level of different experiments ) by extrapolation .",
    "for this task we use the slope of the muon longitudinal profile between sea level and a slant depth of @xmath28 above sea level .",
    "the longitudinal development of subthreshold meson induced showers is parametrized using a slightly modified version of the well - known gaisser - hillas function that gives the number of charged particles at atmospheric depth @xmath14 ,  @xcite : @xmath35 .",

    "the innovative approach of our method is that instead of using the average values of @xmath40 and @xmath41 to generate subthreshold meson showers of a certain energy , we sample their values ( as well as the number of muons ) from their corresponding presimulated distributions , taking into account the correlation between them ( fig .",
    "[ correlation ] ) .",
    "this procedure accounts for the fluctuations in the subshower development .",
    "a technical remark is that we sample the observables directly from their precalculated histograms , i.e. we do not assume any functional form for the distribution . in this way",

    "two competing processes - muon production and muon energy loss and decay - determine the dependence on zenith angle . with increasing zenith angle both the grammage in which showers develop and the distance to the observation level increase .",
    "some additional muons are generated in inclined showers due to the larger number of interactions , but also a large fraction of the low energy muons ( below @xmath46 gev ) decay before reaching sea level .",

    "we have presented an efficient , one - dimensional hybrid method to simulate the development of extensive air showers .",
    "the combination of monte carlo techniques for the interactions of the shower particles above a certain hybrid energy threshold with a presimulated library of pion - induced showers , allows us to simulate the development of large statistical samples of air showers up to the highest energies observed .",
    "previously developed hybrid methods use the average longitudinal development to describe the numerous subthreshold showers and are usually limited to the calculation of the total number of electromagnetic particles . in this paper",
    "we have presented a method that accounts for fluctuations in the shower development as well as the correlations between the different parameters describing the electromagnetic and muon components of eas . by comparing direct simulations with hybrid - simulated showers",
    "we have determined that the correlation between the hadronic and the electromagnetic component is also well reproduced with our method .",
    "in particular the hybrid method correctly describes the correlation between the number of muons and the shower size at observation level , which is of special relevance to studies of the cosmic ray composition .",
    "we have studied the influence of different hadronic interaction models , namely sibyll 1.7 , sibyll 2.1 and qgsjet98 , on shower observables which are relevant for the determination of the energy and chemical composition of the primary cosmic ray flux .",
    "we have presented average values of @xmath2 , @xmath1 and the number of muons above 0.3 , 1 , 3 , 10 and 30 gev at sea level , as well as the fluctuations of these quantities .",
    "the mean muon multiplicities were analyzed with two different models : + ( i ) a simple power - law parametrization , which describes the simulation results with a relative accuracy of better than 10% ( 15% for @xmath57 gev ) , and + ( ii ) a model with a slowly changing power - law index , which gives an excellent description of the data .    the relation between the features of the interaction models and the shower observables has been extensively discussed .",
    "we stress the influence of the different extrapolations of the hadronic models to the highest energies on the features of the electromagnetic and hadronic component of the shower , and the influence of the differences between the models on the number of muons predicted by them . some of these differences exist already at low energies and affect the average numbers of low energy muons .    in qcd - inspired models such as sibyll and qgsjet the predictions on cross sections",
    "are inherently linked to the size of feynman scaling violation , and hence multiplicity , implemented in the model . a model with a steep energy - dependence of the hadron - air cross section",
    "is usually characterized by a moderate increase of the multiplicity . concerning the position of the shower maximum the effect of large feynman scaling violation ( or a steeply rising multiplicity ) is similar to that of a steeply rising cross section .",
    "this is the reason why the @xmath58 predictions of sibyll 2.1 and qgsjet98 are rather similar over a wide energy range . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of muons at sea level reflects the multiplicity of low - energy hadrons produced in a shower but depends only weakly on the hadronic cross sections .",
    "therefore , showers simulated with qgsjet produce consistently more low - energy muons than sibyll showers .    as another application of our method",
    "we have studied the influence of the multiplicity , inelasticity , proton - air cross section on the elongation rate of proton - initiated showers .",
    "we find that the elongation rate has a complex dependence on the scaling violation and cross section behaviour of hadronic interaction models .",
    "again , a steeply rising cross section leads to a decrease of the elongation rate qualitatively similar to a steeply rising multiplicity .",
    "furthermore , a threshold - like behaviour is observed at extremely high energy .",
    "the onset of the hadronic interaction of neutral pions , which always decay at low energy , leads to a significant decrease of the elongation rate .",
    "in forthcoming work we will apply our hybrid method to the determination of the proton - air cross section in experiments that are able to measure the muon and electromagnetic components at fixed depth , as well as in experiments capable of measuring the distribution of @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , we will exploit the fastness of our method to simulate large statistical samples of showers initiated by heavy nuclei , with the aim to predict observables that help studying the composition of the cosmic ray flux .",
