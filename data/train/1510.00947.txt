    "we report the design , construction , and performance of a small prototype  optical time projection chamber ( otpc ) consisting of 40 kg of water viewed by five micro - channel plate photomultipliers ( mcp - pmts ) .",
    "the principle of the otpc is that with photodetectors with adequate time and space resolution , measuring the time and position of arrival of each individual photon emitted by cherenkov radiation from charged particles traversing a volume allows the measurement of the photon drift times .",
    "given the arrival positions and the drift times , the track position and direction can be reconstructed , in analogy with reconstructing tracks from the electron drift times in a conventional gaseous or noble liquid tpc .    due to the faster drift velocity in a medium of photons compared to that of electrons , the expected spatial resolution measured by timing will be poorer .",
    "however , the scale for the required spatial resolution for a large water neutrino detector , for example , is set by the radiation length in water , which is approximately 40  cm  @xcite",
    ". a resolution of less than a few cm per optical sensor may then be adequate to do event tracking for isolated or separated tracks .",
    "the otpc rests on three enabling technologies :    1 .   the use of mcp - based photodetectors with a single photo - electron transit - time resolution measured in 10 s of picoseconds and a correlated position measurement with a resolution measured in mm  @xcite , able to cover a large surface area economically . in a conventional large water cherenkov detector",
    "the size of the pmt precludes knowing the position of arrival to within the size of the cathode .",
    "the use of microstrip anodes  @xcite , with bandwidths matched to the photodetector pulse , to cover large areas while preserving the temporal and spatial information encoded by the incident photon .",
    "the microstrips provide spatial resolution along the strip direction from the difference in pulse arrival times at the two ends , and in the transverse direction by charge sharing among strips , allowing mm resolution in two dimensions while requiring only a one - dimensional array of electronics readout channels  @xcite .",
    "the development of an economical ( in quantity ) low - power waveform sampling application specific integrated circuit ( asic ) capable of multiple samples on the rising edge of the fast pulse from an mcp - pmt  @xcite , and intrinsic intra - chip jitter measured in picoseconds . in this case",
    "we have developed the psec4 asic , operated at 10.24 gigasamples - per - second , with an effective dynamic range of 10.5 bits  @xcite .",
    "the prototype whose design and performance is described below differs from a future large detector .",
    "in particular , a small path length allows ignoring dispersion of the photon velocities and scattering in the water . on the other hand ,",
    "the much larger lappd@xmath8 detectors have demonstrated a gain 10-times larger than the commercial mcp - pmts used here , with the potential for better time resolution@xcite . in a larger detector ,",
    "measuring tracks over a longer length and with a larger photo - detection coverage would provide more constraints on the 3d event topology ( including the potential for an extended and optimized use of optical mirrors ) .      to demonstrate this technique ,",
    "we have built a 40  kg water cherenkov detector using a combination of commercial mcp - pmts and optical mirrors .",
    "a concept drawing of the optical setup of one of the five mcp - pmt s of this detector is shown in figure  [ fig : otpc ] .",
    "for each planar mcp - pmt mounted on the water volume , a mirror is mounted on the opposing side creating an image of the cherenkov light hitting the opposing wall . for a given charged particle track",
    ", the mirror adds a discrete set of reflected photons that can be time - resolved from the direct photons , thus economically doubling the photo - detection efficiency over the angular acceptance of the detector .",
    "as the lappd mcp - pmts are not yet available for use outside of a test setup  @xcite , this prototype relies on commercial mcp - pmts that exhibit approximately the same detection resolutions , but with 1/16 the photo - active area per unit .",
    "the commercial photo - detector used is the planacon xp85022 mcp - pmt device from photonis  @xcite .",
    "the total photo - cathode coverage in the prototype otpc is 125  @xmath1 on the surface area of 1700  @xmath1 that encloses the fiducial volume .",
    "the otpc prototype detector is described in @xmath9[sec : detector ] , including the design of the optics in @xmath9[sec : detoptics ] and details on the photodetector modules ( pm ) in @xmath9[sec : pmodule ] .",

    "the otpc photo - detection efficiency and gain are derived in sections  [ sec : pdeff ] and  [ subsec : gain ] .",
    "the test - beam results are shown in the final four sections , including the number of photo - electrons along the track  ( @xmath9[sec : charge ] ) , resolving the direct and mirror - reflected cherenkov photons and the time - projection along the beam axis  ( @xmath9[sec : timing ] ) , the angular resolution  ( @xmath9[sec : angle ] ) , and the spatial resolution of the reconstructed tracks  ( @xmath9[sec:3d ] ) .",
    "the conclusions are given in @xmath9[conclude ] .",
    "the prototype otpc detector is constructed from a 24  cm inner - diameter poly - vinyl chloride ( pvc ) cylindrical pipe cut to a length of 77  cm  @xcite .",
    "six 11  cm diameter ports were machined in the tube arranged in 2 columns of three ports each along the cylindrical axis , as shown in figure  [ fig : otpcdraw ] .",
    "these columns have an azimuthal separation of 65@xmath10 .",
    "the photodetector modules ( pms ) , described in @xmath9[sec : pmodule ] , are mounted on five of these ports ( the 6th port was occupied by a conventional pmt used as a diagnostic trigger ) . the column with 3 pms installed",
    "is denoted the ` normal ' view and the other the ` stereo ' view .    for each pm",
    ", a first - surface broadband optical mirror is mounted on the opposing wall facing the pm port .",
    "the 7.6  cm square mirrors are installed on the interior wall of the cylinder at an angle of 48@xmath10 , denoted as @xmath11@xmath12 in figure  [ fig : otpcray ] .",
    "the remaining exposed pvc surfaces of the interior wall are coated with light absorbing paint  @xcite .",
    "the detector is filled with 40  l of deionized water for the target volume . because of the detector angular acceptance , the cherenkov light directionality , and since only the first five the ports are instrumented , the effective fiducial volume is limited to roughly the top two - thirds of the total volume , corresponding to a fiducial mass of @xmath13  kg .",
    "the optical quality of the water in the otpc was measured to be notably poor , although it was not a limitation for the short photon path lengths in this detector .",
    "we found the water attenuation length by measuring 1-cm - deep samples with a dual - beam spectrophotometer  @xcite at various post - fill intervals , as shown in figure  [ fig : waterattn ] . compared to a pure water standard , the absolute absorbance at over the 300 - 500  nm range is 50 to 100 times worse .",
    "this can be attributed to several factors .",
    "one , there is no filtration system to remove particulates in the volume .",
    "second , in the 12  hr and 60  day measurements a noticeable degradation in the near - uv part of the spectrum was observed .",
    "this is likely due to uv stabilizers in the pvc enclosure leaching into the water  @xcite .",
    "data taken within the first 6  hours of a water fill have a @xmath14 attenuation length >  0.5  m at  300  nm .",
    "the longest path lengths in the otpc , taken by the mirror - reflected photons , are approximately 0.3  m.              the optical properties of the detector components in the light path , as quoted by the manufacturers  @xcite , are shown versus wavelength in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrals ] . despite efforts to capture as much near - uv cherenkov light as possible by using fused - silica windows",
    ", we found that these wavelengths are cut off by the optical coupling gel between the window of the port and the mcp - pmt .",
    "the characteristics of the light - absorbing paint were modeled with a broadband 95% absorbance and a 5% diffuse reflectance .    with low - timing jitter and high granularity mcp - pmts ,",
    "the water chromaticity and scattering properties become important as the distance from the particle track to the photo - detector increases",
    ". the cherenkov photons , which are generated at an angle specified by the phase velocity of the dielectric medium , propagate at the speed at which energy is transported in the dielectric : the group velocity . as shown by jackson",
    "@xcite , the group velocity is expressed as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the phase and group index of the medium , respectively .",
    "the group index is both greater in magnitude and more dispersive than @xmath16 , as shown in figure  [ fig : indices]a .",
    "the spectrum of detected photons is the convolution of the otpc spectral response and the cherenkov spectrum  @xcite .",
    "a full detector simulation , which includes the otpc geometry , water volume , and optics , was built using the chroma toolkit  @xcite .",
    "a simulation of @xmath18 muons with a uniform distribution of energies between 1 and 10 gev gives a spectrum of detected photons of 370@xmath19  nm , with the spread covering about 95@xmath20 of the spectrum around the mean wavelength . over this wavelength range , @xmath21 .",
    "the relative timing errors due to chromatic dispersion of the group velocity are shown in figure  [ fig : indices]b . at the maximum photon drift - length in the prototype otpc ( @xmath2230  cm ) ,",
    "the expected timing error is about @xmath2325  ps , which is small compared to the measured single photon timing resolution of 75  ps shown in @xmath9[sec : lasertests ] .",
    "averaging over the dispersion effects , the effective photon drift - speed in the otpc is given by the weighted average of the group velocity over the detected photon spectrum , @xmath24 .",
    "consider a particle traveling through the otpc as shown in figure  [ fig : otpcray ] , but further generalizing the track by allowing a polar angle , @xmath25 , with respect to the z - axis ( see the caption of figure  [ fig : otpcdraw ] ) .",

    "this is not a necessary ingredient of an otpc , but is an effective and economical method of increasing limited photocathode coverage .",
    "each mirror is mounted at an angle , @xmath37 of 90@xmath10-@xmath38 .",
    "for a small range of particle angles , the mirror creates a time - delayed image of the cherenkov light on the opposing wall at the mcp - pmt .",
    "the discrete mirror positions provide a technique to measure the longitudinal track location across a single mcp - pmt by using the measured time difference between the direct and mirror - reflected cherenkov light .",

    "[ eqn : mirror ] : @xmath44    the scaling factor accounts for relative optical path lengths when the particle is off the otpc center - line .",
    "for example , for tracks closer to the mirror , the reflected cherenkov photons detected at the pm are generated along the charged particle track at a later time than the direct photons .",
    "the distance , @xmath42 , from the angled mirror center - point to the photo - detector module is 18@xmath231  cm .",
    "the otpc is instrumented with five photodetector modules ( pm ) , which provide the photon detection using the commercial ` planacon ' xp85022 mcp - pmt device from photonis  @xcite .",

    "the latter mcp - pmt exhibited lower gain and detection efficiency .",
    "while reading out each of the planacon s 1024 anodes might provide the best - case granularity and pile - up rejection per channel , it presents a challenge when instrumenting a detector with many such photo - detectors .",
    "instead , we adopt a similar microstrip readout scheme as the first - generation glass package lappds  @xcite .",
    "a thirty - two channel microstrip anode pcb board was designed such that a column of 32 anode pads is mapped to a single 50  @xmath3 transmission line .",
    "each microstrip line serves as both the dc  return and the high fidelity signal path for @xmath48 of the mcp - pmt .",
    "the central 30 strips are digitized while keeping the two edge strips terminated at 50  @xmath3 .",

    "the accelerated electron shower from the mcp will induce a quasi - tem wave between the microstrip s signal and reference plane  @xcite .",

    "two high - density multi - channel 50@xmath3 coaxial cables per microstrip array end bring these waveforms off the board  @xcite .",
    "the readout strategy adopted for the otpc is to digitize the waveforms on the microstrips at only one end , leaving the multi - channel cables at the other end unterminated .",
    "thus , the wave that initially propagates along a transmission - line microstrip toward the open end will be reflected with the same polarity back towards the digitizer for that strip , which then captures the waveforms caused by the initial pulse in both its direct and reflected manifestations ( see fig .
