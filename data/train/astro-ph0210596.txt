    "the quest to find ordered structures in the system of satellites of the milky way galaxy dates back to 30 years ago when possible alignments of globular clusters and/or dwarf galaxies along wide streams were first noted @xcite .",
    "the mounting consensus for scenarios in which the accretion of satellites has a major role in the formation of the outer halo of the galaxy @xcite prompted a new burst of such kind of studies since the mid 90s up to the present day @xcite . despite the many interesting suggestions , none of the quoted studies was able to provide a conclusive proof of the reality of the alignments , mainly because of the overwhelming difficulty to assess the statistical significance of structures formed by inherently small numbers of objects .",
    "however , recent theoretical and observational achievements may help us to look into the problem from a different and more fruitful perspective :    1 .",
    "n - body simulations of the process of galaxy assembly , starting from standard cosmological conditions ( cold dark matter - cdm ) , strongly suggest that the hierarchical merging of satellites is the main driver of galaxy formation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "independent of the assumed cosmology , it has been demonstrated that the accretion / disruption of satellites into the halo of a larger galaxy may leave long - lived relics in the form of streams of stellar ( and/or dark matter ) remnants that remain aligned to the orbital path of the parent satellite @xcite .",
    "3 .   convincing observational evidence of the clumpy and `` filamentary '' nature of the galactic halo have been provided by many different groups ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the _ in vivo _ example of a satellite accretion / disruption is provided by the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( sgr dsph ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is currently merging with the milky way , and is carrying its own globular cluster system ( i.e. , m  54 , ter  8 , arp  2 and ter  7 , previously believed to be normal galactic globulars ) .",
    "there is now clear observational evidence that the sgr dsph is loosing stars under the strain of the milky way tidal field .",
    "these tidally - removed stars are found along a huge ( and quite coherent ) stream extending all over the sky ( sgr stream , see * ? ? ?",

    "* hereafter il98 ) , and @xcite have simulated the evolution of the sgr dsph over several orbital periods ( p @xmath4 gyr ) , computing the orbit of the galaxy as well as the phase - space distribution of the debris under different assumptions about the flattening of the cdm halo .",
    "the initial conditions of the simulations were based on the known position and radial velocity of sgr dsph and on its proper motion as estimated by @xcite .",
    "the orbit has a planar rosette structure , with the pole of the orbit located at [ @xmath5 , @xmath6 ( i.e. a nearly polar orbit ) , and peri- and apo - galactic distances of @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively .",
    "the derived orbit has been successfully compared with the observed position of the sgr stream @xcite , providing also remarkable indications that the dark halo of the milky way is nearly spherical .    in this framework",
    "it is a tantalizing application to look for other halo globulars that may be correlated with the orbital path of the sgr dwarf , and which could be lying in the sgr stream . in particular , we look for the phase - space coincidence of outer halo globulars with the computed orbit of the sgr dsph from 1  gyr ago up to the present day , searching for the most recent episodes of globular cluster loss , i.e. the ones whose traces are most likely to be still detectable .",
    "for our comparison we selected from the catalogue by @xcite the 35 globular clusters in the range of galactocentric distance @xmath9 . among these , 33 have also measured radial velocity @xmath0 . for sake of brevity and clarity",
    "we will call this sample the outer halo sample ( ohs ) , in the following . with this selection",
    "we avoid the central part of the galactic halo where it is less likely that ordered structures can survive for a long time , and we leave out of the sample the handful of clusters lying outside of @xmath10 , a region that lies beyond the sgr stream according to the il98 orbit kpc , namely pal  14 , eridanus , pal  3 , ngc  2419 , pal  4 , and am1 . their respective galactocentric distances are @xmath11 65 , 83 , 90 , 98 , 99 , and 117 kpc , much beyond the apogalacticon of the sgr orbit .",
    "the adopted outer radial threshold ( @xmath12 , quite similar to the one adopted by * ? ? ?",
    "* i.e. , @xmath13 ) provides the selection of a homogeneous sample without significant gaps . ] .",
    "the adopted ohs _ does not include the known sgr globulars _ , to avoid the detection of the obvious signal of their clustering around the center of the sgr galaxy .    in figure  1",
    "we show the ohs clusters ( small solid circles ) and the sgr orbit in the planes formed by the rectangular galactocentric coordinates , the @xmath14-axis points in the direction of galactic rotation ; while the @xmath15-axis towards the north galactic pole . ] ( @xmath16 , in kpc ) and in the @xmath17 [ kpc ] vs. @xmath0 [ km / s ] plane .",
    "the large full circles are the known sgr globulars , which we also show in the plots for completeness .",
    "note that these clusters lie around the end of the orbit corresponding to the present time ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "we highlight ( with encircled solid circles ) six more clusters that lie remarkably close to the orbit in all the considered planes .",
    "these clusters are : pal  12 ( whose association to the sgr stream has been already established by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ngc  4147 , ngc  5634 , ngc  5053 , pal  5 and ter  3 .",
    "is this association _ real _ or could it be the mere occurrence of a chance alignment ?",
    "though chance alignments in the four - dimensional phase space ( x , y , z,@xmath0 ) are not expected to be very likely , the key point is to quantify the probability that the observed structure could have originated from a statistical fluctuation . to do this we will compare the observed distribution - and its phase space distance to the sgr orbit - with synthetic samples ( having the same dimension as the ohs ) extracted from a model representing an unstructured parent halo .",
    "the most conservative comparison that can be made is with a model that closely resembles the observed radial and velocity distribution of the ohs .",
    "figure  2 ( upper panel ) shows that the cumulative radial distribution of the ohs is well reproduced by a spherical halo model with a density distribution @xmath19 . a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test shows that the probability that the ohs is drawn from the @xmath20 model is @xmath21% . on the other hand ,",
    "the probability that the same sample is drawn from the other two models shown for comparison ( @xmath22 , and @xmath23 ) is @xmath24% .",
    "doubts may be cast on the appropriateness of a spherical model .",
    "it may be conceived that if the _ true _ parent halo is flattened , some excess of clustering of the observed points along an orbit with low inclination may artificially emerge in the comparison with a spherical model .",
    "this is clearly not the case , however , since the il98 orbit is nearly polar , i.e. it is almost perpendicular to the galactic plane ( see figure  1 ) . in the lower panel of figure  2",
    "it is shown that the observed distribution of radial velocity of the ohs is well reproduced by a gaussian distribution with @xmath25 and @xmath26 . according to a ks test",
    "the probability that the observed sample is drawn from the model distribution is @xmath21% .    in the following simulations we extract all the synthetic samples from a spherical and isotropic model with @xmath27 and with the gaussian distribution of radial velocities shown in figure  2 . for each simulated cluster ( as well as for all the ohs ones )",
    "we computed the spatial distance from the nearest point in the sgr orbit ( @xmath28 , in kpc ) and the difference between their radial velocity and the one predicted from the computed orbit at that point ( @xmath29 ) .    in figure  3 ,",
    "the @xmath28 values of the selected clusters ( large filled circles ) are plotted against their @xmath30 .",
    "the encircled points are the six clusters highlighted in figure  1 .",
    "a sample of 10000 synthetic clusters ( dots ) extracted from the adopted model is also shown , for comparison , in the upper panel of figure  3 .",
    "the ohs clusters show a remarkable over - density toward the sgr orbit , that lies in the origin of the axis in the considered plane .",
    "the dashed dotted lines enclose the points whose observed radial velocity is within @xmath31 of the velocity predicted by the il98 orbit .",
    "note that the expected velocity dispersion of the sgr debris along the sgr stream is @xmath32 , according to @xcite .",
    "the continuous vertical segments are placed at @xmath336 , 12 , and 18 kpc .",
    "the lower panel of figure  3 is arranged in the same way , but in this case the dots represent the distribution of the points in the best - fitting @xcite simulation that retains a bound core to the present day .",
    "the boldface dots are the particles that remain bound to sgr _ or were bound less than 3 gyr ago _ , while the ordinary dots are particles that were already unbound at that time .",
    "note the remarkable similarity with the distribution of the ohs clusters .",
    "in particular , the correlation between the particles that have flown in the sgr stream in recent times ( less than 3 gyr ago ) and the ohs clusters with @xmath34 at any @xmath28 is quite striking .",
    "we define @xmath35 as the number of synthetic or real clusters having @xmath36 and @xmath37 . for example",
    ", it can be seen from figure  3 that there are five ohs clusters with @xmath38 and @xmath39 , thus @xmath40 . in the same way we find @xmath41 and @xmath42 from the observed sample .",
    "now the question is _ what is the probability that a sample having @xmath35 greater or equal to the observed one ( @xmath43 ) is drawn from the assumed unstructured model ? _ to answer this question we randomly extracted 10000 samples of 32 synthetic clusters from the assumed model , and for each of them we measured @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "figure  4 reports the distributions of @xmath44 ( upper panel ) , @xmath45 ( middle panel ) , and @xmath46 ( lower panel ) for the 10000 simulated samples .",
    "the respective observed values are indicated by a dashed line . in all of the considered cases",
    "the mean and modal @xmath35 values of the distribution are much smaller than the observed ones .",
    "@xmath47 occurs for only 200 simulated samples in 10000 ( 2% of the cases ) , @xmath48 occurs only for 42 samples in 10000 ( @xmath49% ) , and @xmath50 occurs only in 2 cases in 10000 ( @xmath51% ) .",
    "it can be concluded that it is highly improbable that the observed clustering of the ohs globulars around the sgr orbit occur by chance alignment .",
    "it is important to remark again that the model from which the simulated samples have been extracted has the same @xmath17 and @xmath0 distribution of the observed sample .",
    "thus _ the sgr orbit appears to be a strongly preferred subset of the phase - space for the galactic globulars _ in the considered range of @xmath17 .",
    "finally , we note that the simulated samples that have a significant probability of realization ( e.g. , @xmath52% ) have @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , significantly lower than the observed values .",
    "hence , the significance of the detected phase - space structure can not be due to the actual correlation of just a couple of clusters with the sgr orbit . according to the distributions shown in fig .  4 , the probability that @xmath56 is @xmath57% .",
    "therefore it can be stated , with 95% confidence , that at least 4 real associations are needed to produce the observed signal of @xmath42 .",
    "the above test demonstrates that the observed phase - space clumping around the orbit of the sgr dwarf galaxy is highly unlikely to have occurred by a chance coincidence , if the halo globular cluster population is indeed distributed according to the simple spherical model described above . to address this concern",
    ", we performed a second test , using `` bootstrapped '' artificial data sets constructed from the real ohs .",
    "the artificial samples were constructed by rotating the position of each real globular cluster by a random azimuthal angle about the galactic center , and introducing a random flip perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "this implicitly assumes , of course , that the globular cluster distribution is symmetric about the galactic center , as well as above and below the galactic plane .",
    "a slight complication arises from the fact that we do not know the proper motion of many of the clusters , so we can not deduce the heliocentric radial velocity that the cluster should have at its new position .",
    "we therefore have to assume some model for the halo velocity distribution ; we take a simple gaussian model , and draw random realizations of the total space velocity @xmath58 consistent with the observed heliocentric velocity @xmath0 ( that is , we calculate the conditional probability of @xmath58 given @xmath0 ) .",
    "having defined thereby the 3-dimensional velocity vector , we rotate the vector to the new position , and project it along the line of sight to the sun ( corrections for the peculiar motion of the sun and for galactic rotation are made ) . with a gaussian model that has @xmath59 and @xmath60 , we find that out of 10000 artificial data sets , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "for comparison , for a model with @xmath64 ( or @xmath65 ) and @xmath66 , the statistics are as follows : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , where the result in brackets refers to the higher velocity dispersion model . according to these tests using",
    "`` bootstrapped '' random data sets , the observed phase - space clumping is highly unlikely to have occurred by chance , in agreement with our previous test .",
    "the fact that the observed structure has a slightly lower statistical significance with the `` bootstrapped '' samples than was deduced from the previous test with its perfectly isotropic and isothermal random samples is not surprising .",
    "this is presumably a consequence of occasional chance reappearances of ( part of ) the structure of the real ohs in the `` bootstrapped '' samples .    as a final remark",
    ", we note that the region of the @xmath70 plane with @xmath71 and @xmath72 kpc is also populated by particles that become unbound more than 3 gyr ago .",
    "thus it has to be considered the possibility that some of the ohs clusters found in that region drifted into the sgr stream in more ancient times .",
    "for instance , this can be the case for ngc  5634 , as we argue elsewhere @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the discussion of the individual ohs clusters is beyond the scope of the present analysis .",
    "thanks to the painstaking effort of a few teams of astronomers , estimates of the proper motions ( hereafter pms ) of 41 galactic globular clusters are now available ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for complete lists and references ) .",
    "most of these measures have quite sizeable uncertainties , ranging from @xmath73 mas / yr to @xmath74 mas year .",
    "moreover , subtle - and unaccounted - systematics may still affect them , as suggested by the large differences between independent estimates of the motion of the same cluster . in the list by @xcite",
    "there are 14 cluster with more than one pm estimate .",
    "the average absolute difference among independent estimates for the same cluster are @xmath75 mas / year in @xmath76 and @xmath77 mas / year in the @xmath78 component .",
    "differences much larger than the quoted errors ( up to @xmath79 times ) are common and a reasonable assumption of the _ minimum _ uncertainty of the proper motion estimates is probably @xmath80 mas / year in each component .",
    "hence , while available pms may be very valuable , for instance , to characterize the _ kind _ of orbit followed by a given globular , they are expected to have a modest constraining power in the application presented in this paper .",
    "such constraining power is also lowered by the fact that pms predicted by the model we are comparing with carry their own , non negligible , uncertainty ( typically @xmath81 mas / yr in each component , which we estimate from the intrinsic dispersions in distance , position and velocity in the n - body stream models , assuming a 20% uncertainty in the galactic circular velocity at @xmath82 )",
    ". radial velocities , being unaffected by uncertainties in the distance , are more reliably predicted by the model and are easily , and much more accurately , measured . for these reasons we preferred to limit the bulk of our analysis to the the ( x , y , z,@xmath0 ) phase - space .",
    "yet it may be interesting to compare the pms predicted by the il98 model for the clusters that are candidate members of the sgr stream ( listed in table 1 , see below ) , with the observational estimates .",
    "the orientations ( directions ) of the pm vectors are expected to be less sensitive to systematics with respect to the actual moduli . in fig .",
    "5 we compare the predicted and observed _ directions _ of the pm vectors of the seven clusters listed in tab .  1 for which pm estimates are available",
    ". four of these seven clusters have two independent pm estimates : in these cases we report the comparison with both values ( see caption ) . we stress that this kind of comparison _ can not have a serious impact on our previous conlusions _ except if both the following conditions were simultaneously fulfilled : ( a ) if accurate pm estimates were available for all the considered clusters ( or the large majority of them ) , and ( b ) if less than 3 - 4 clusters were found to have observed pms in agreement with the predictions .",
    "this case would imply that the correlation among ohs clusters and the sgr orbit we detect in the ( x , y , z,@xmath0 ) phase - space is largely due to a very unlikely ( but not impossible ) chance alignment in four dimensions . on the other hand some ( up to @xmath79 , actually ) of the clusters listed in table 1 _",
    "are expected not to belong to the detected structure_.    in panel ( a ) the predicted proper motions include a correction for the solar reflex motion ( hereafter s.r.m . ) , assuming a galactocentric distance of @xmath83 , a circular velocity of @xmath84 and the peculiar motion of the sun as derived by @xcite .",
    "the predicted pm directions of all the seven clusters agree with the observed values to within @xmath85 .",
    "the adoption of alternative pm estimates does not change significantly the observed correlation . however",
    ", the result of this comparison may be affected by the inclusion of the solar reflex motion .",
    "hence , in panel ( b ) we present the comparison between the plain ( uncorrected for the s.r.m ) model predictions and the observed pm directions after correction for the s.r.m .",
    "the result is very similar to that presented in panel ( a ) despite of the larger errors involved .",
    "the only cluster whose predicted and observed pm directions differ by more than @xmath86 is pal  12 , e.g. the only one for which independent evidences of membership to the sgr stream are already available @xcite .    in conclusion , it is found that the available proper motion estimates are fully compatible with the results presented in  2 .",
    "given the high degree of correlation among predicted and observed pm directions shown in both panels of fig .",
    "5 one may also be tempted to draw firm conclusion on the actual membership of individual clusters .",
    "nevertheless , in our view , this may still be an hazard .",
    "if one looks at the amplitude of the individual corrections it is found that ( a ) all the considered clusters have at least one component of the pm vector that is corrected by more than 50 % of the observed value , ( b ) 4 out of seven clusters have at least one component whose s.r.m correction is larger that 100 % of the observed values and , ( c ) corrections as large as 200 - 400 % are indeed applied in some cases . given the remarkable uncertainties in the observed pms and the uncertainties involved in the s.r.m correction it is easy to conclude that currently measured pms are not good tracers of the actual motion of the considered clusters and are instead predominantly measures of the solar reflex motion .",
    "these considerations fully support the approach followed in  2 , e.g. using only positions and radial velocity measurements in the search for statistical structures in the globular cluster system of the milky way .",
    "the possible association of galactic globulars with the sgr dsph galaxy has been considered before @xcite .",
    "all these studies strongly rely on pm estimates .",
    "furthermore they are centered on testing the actual association of individual clusters to the sgr galaxy and its remnants . on the other hand our approach and our results are statistical in nature .",
    "we find a statistically significant clustering of ohs clusters along the sgr orbit but we have no possibility to check individual membership , except for the limited test shown in  2.1 .",
    "we can only provide a list of possible members , ranked according to their distance to the sgr orbit in the ( x , y , z,@xmath0 ) phase - space ( e.g. , tab .  1 ) .",
    "hence , the comparison with the above quoted studies can be made only in a broadly general sense .",
    "@xcite performed a thorough study of the orbits of the galactic globulars for which pm estimates are available . in doing this , they identify three metal - poor clusters having orbits typical of the thick disc ( instead that of the halo , as expected ) and they check the hypothesis that the peculiar orbits of these clusters ( namely ngc  6254 , ngc  6626 and ngc  6752 ) could be due to their former membership to the sgr dsph , concluding that this possibility is unlikely .",
    "all these clusters have @xmath87 , and are thus are not included in the ohs considered here and we can not comment further on the @xcite results .    following the suggestion of @xcite , @xcite modeled the ( pm based ) orbits of the sgr dsph and of pal  12 and concluded that the available observations are compatible with the possibility that the cluster was torn from the galaxy @xmath88 gyr ago .",
    "our analysis confirms this result .",
    "@xcite obtained an estimate of the pm of pal  13 and compared the general characteristics of the integrated orbit of the cluster ( total energy , angular momentum , eccentricity , perigalactic and apogalactic radii ) to those of five satellite galaxies of the milky way , including sgr .",
    "they conclude that a common origin for pal  13 and sgr is unlikely",
    ". however we note that ( a ) sgr provides ( by far ) the best match to the orbital parameters of pal  13 with respect to any other considered galaxy ( see siegel et al.s tab .  8) , the maximum discrepancy being @xmath89% in angular momentum , and ( b ) the orbital parameters are provided without any uncertainty , as if the adopted pms were perfectely known . in our view",
    "this shortcoming seriously weakens the conclusion by these authors .",
    "here we adopt the same pm estimate obtained by @xcite , reaching the conclusion that pal  13 is a possible member of the sgr stream by direct comparison with a model that includes the sgr stream itself .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter pmj02 ) performed a global search for structures made of galactic satellites , adopting the technique of the `` orbital poles '' , originally introduced by @xcite . in this kind of analysis one",
    "searches for intersections among the great circles described by the familiy of possible poles of the orbit of any given satellite .",
    "as stated by pmj02 `` any set of objects having common origin and mantaining a common orbit , no matter how spread out in the sky , will have great circle pole families ( gcpfs ) that intersects at the same pair of antipodal points on the celestial sphere '' .",
    "adding the information from pms , pmj02 limit the valid pole family of each satellite to an arc of its great circle of orbital poles ( arc segment pole family , aspf ) . with this technique",
    "they select a set of candidate - former - members of the sgr galaxy ( ter  7 , ter  8 , arp  2 , m  54 , m  53 , ngc  5053 , pal  5 , m  5 , pal  12 and ngc  6356 ) by requiring that their gcpf come within 5 deg from the sgr acpf and @xmath90 kpc .",
    "the first four clusters in their list are the well known present members of the galaxy .",
    "they rise doubts of the clear association of each of the other candidate members .",
    "for instance , they exclude ngc  5053 and m  53 because their metal content is lower than any of the known sgr globulars=-1.99 $ ] ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "see also below , for further discussion about non - kynematic criteria of selection of candidate sgr members . ] .",
    "with the same arguments adopted by @xcite for pal  13 they argue that pal  5 and pal  12 are unlikely members of the family , but they can not rule out the possibility . finally , they conclude that despite the counter - arguments presented they mantain their original list of candidates , with the exception of ngc  5053 . elsewhere in the paper , they also note that ngc  5466 has energy and angular momentum within 1-@xmath91 of those of the sgr galaxy .",
    "ngc  6356 , m  5 and m  53 have @xmath92 kpc , hence are not included in our sample .",
    "the possible association of ngc  5466 with the sgr dsph is confirmed by our analysis .",
    "the possible association of ngc  5053 , pal  5 and pal  12 is also confirmed by the present work .",
    "pmj02 also suggested a possible association of ngc  4147 with a group of clusters whose orbits may be related to those of the magellanic clouds , but they state that the result is very uncertain .",
    "furthermore we note that on the same basis the possible association of m  53 ( elsewhere classified as a candidate for association with sgr ) with the small magellanic cloud and ursa minor is also suggested by pmj02 .",
    "we conclude that there is no serious disagreement between the present analysis and the one by pmj02 .    the present contribution",
    ", however , _ provides the first proof that the orbit of sgr is a preferential subset of phase - space for globular clusters inhabiting the outer halo of the milky way _ , and we place this result on a sound statistical basis , a result not accomplished by any of the previous studies .",
    "the success of the present analysis is due to the direct comparison of the positional and kinematical properties of the ohs clusters with a realistic model of the orbit of the sgr dsph and its relics , that has been previously tested against independent observations @xcite .",
    "finally , we shall shortly comment on `` non - kinematic '' criteria that have been used to assess the association of a given cluster to the sgr galaxy .",
    "many authors ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) have discussed the likeliness of the membership of their candidates on the basis of the similarity of their metallicity , horizontal branch ( hb ) morphology and/or structural parameters with those of the four known sgr clusters . in our opinion",
    "this approach may not be very useful .",
    "it is quite clear that sgr was a much larger and complex system in the past and its present status ( as well as its present gc system ) may be not fully representative of its original range of properties . if , by chance , the cluster ter  7 had been lost by the sgr galaxy in the previous perigalactic passage , this kind of criteria would have _ erroneously _ classified it as a bad candidate for sgr membership , since ter  7 is much more metal rich ( @xmath93\\simeq -0.5 $ ] ) than any of the other clusters that are still present in the main body of sgr dsph ( @xmath93<-1.5 $ ] ) .",
    "moreover , the existence of population and/or metallicity gradients may have driven the preferential loss of metal poor populations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , making the actual low metallicity limit of the sgr stellar population quite uncertain .",
    "the judgement of the likelihood of membership on the basis of the hb morphology is even less justified since it is well known that clusters of different morphologies do actually co - exist in real galaxies ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein , for the case for fornax ) .",
    "a much more reliable discriminant may be provided , in the future , by the detailed abundance patterns of the clusters .",
    "for instance , the behaviour of @xmath94 elements as a function of @xmath93 $ ] is determined by the star formation history of the parent galaxy ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) that was ( probably ) not the same in the sgr dsph and in the galactic halo . in this context",
    "it is interesting to note that pal  12 , ru  106 @xcite and pal  5 @xcite have been found to be less @xmath94-enhanced than galactic halo globulars of similar metallicity .    for the above reasons , we rely only on phase - space parameters in our analisys , recalling that by searching the lost relics of the sgr system we are trying the reconstruct its original properties , not the present day ones .",
    "we have demonstrated that there is a coherent structure in the phase - space distribution of the outer halo globular cluster of the milky way , strongly correlated with the orbital path of the sgr dsph galaxy .",
    "this correlation can not have originated by chance , as a random realization of an unstructured halo , if such halo has the same distribution of galactocentric distance and radial velocity as the considered ohs clusters .",
    "several of the ohs globular clusters have spatial positions and radial velocities compatible with the hypothesis that they are following the same orbit as the sgr dsph , i.e. they probably belong to the sgr stream .",
    "furthermore the spread in phase space around the sgr orbit of such clusters is similar to that predicted for the sgr stream population , according to the numerical simulations by @xcite .",
    "we conclude , with 95% confidence , that _ at least 4 ( out of 32 ) of the ohs clusters are physically associated with the sgr stream and were former members of the sgr dsph_. it should be noted however , that the analysis presented in this contribution is best suited to identify clusters that became unbound relatively recently . in principle , more ohs globular clusters could be associated with the sgr stream .    in table  1",
    "we report the list of the selected globulars having @xmath95 km / s and @xmath96 , in order of increasing @xmath28 .",
    "the proper motions predicted by the il98 model are also reported in table  1 .",
    "since the adopted analysis is statistical in nature it is clear that some of the clusters listed in tab .",
    "1 may be just occasional interlopers of the sgr orbit ( up to 10 over 14 in the worst case , according to our estimate ) .",
    "the comparison with the available proper motion estimates shown in  2.1 does not provide any strong indication in this regard .",
    "while the actual membership to the sgr stream of each individual cluster can be firmly established only with very accurate proper motion measures ( as will be achieved by dedicated space missions like gaia or sim ) , it is reasonable to assume that the clusters with the smaller @xmath28 are the ones for which the membership is more likely ( see  2.1 ) .",
    "we make the hypothesis that the six clusters more closely associated with the sgr orbital path ( i.e. those put in evidence in figures  1 and 3 ) are former members of the sgr dsph . in this case",
    "the number of globular clusters originally in the sgr galaxy is @xmath97 .",
    "if we adopt for the sgr dsph the same _ globular cluster specific frequency _ ( @xmath98 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the only other galactic dsph that has a globular cluster system , i.e. fornax @xmath99 , we obtain an estimate of the total absolute magnitude of sgr before the occurrence of any tidal stripping , @xmath100 .",
    "@xcite estimated that in the sgr stream there are as many stars as in the present undisrupted body of the galaxy , thus the _ ab initio _ total luminosity of the sgr dsph was roughly two times the present value .",
    "hence the total absolute magnitude at that time was @xmath101 ( where @xmath102 , from * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the excellent agreement between the two independent estimates of the initial @xmath103 fully supports the plausibility of the proposed scenario .    according to the results presented",
    ", it emerges that the sgr dsph was not only an important contributor of halo field stars @xcite but it also had a significant role in the building - up of the globular clusters system of the milky way .",
