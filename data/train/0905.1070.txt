    "azimuthal correlation measurements in au+aucollisions at rhic have been shown to consist of a mixture of jet and harmonic contributions  @xcite .",
    "jet contributions are found to be relatively small for @xmath5 2.0 gev/@xmath2 , with away - side jet yields strongly suppressed  @xcite .",
    "significant modifications to the away - side jet topology have also been reported  @xcite .",

    "the brackets denote statistical averaging over particles and events .",
    "the first two harmonics @xmath8 and @xmath0 are referred to as directed and elliptic flow , respectively .",
    "it has been found that at low (  @xmath9 gev/@xmath2 ) the magnitude and trends of 2 are under - predicted by hadronic cascade models supplemented with string dynamics  @xcite , but are well reproduced by models which either incorporate hydrodynamic flow  @xcite with a first order phase transition and rapid thermalization , @xmath10 fm / c @xcite , or use a quasi - particle ansatz but include more than just 2-to-2 interactions  @xcite .",
    "the mass dependence of @xmath0 as a function of has been studied using identified baryons and mesons  @xcite and empirical scaling of elliptic flow per constituent quark was observed when the signal and the of the hadron were divided by the number of constituent quarks @xmath11 ( @xmath11 = 2 for mesons , 3 for baryons ) .",
    "this scaling is most clearly observed by plotting the data as a function of transverse kinetic energy  @xmath12  @xcite , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the transverse mass and mass of the particle , respectively .",
    "a recent study  @xcite finds that the constituent quark scaling holds up to  @xmath15  gev .",
    "this indicates partonic , rather than hadronic flow , and suggests that the bulk matter collectivity develops before hadronization takes place  @xcite .",
    "results for the @xmath0 of the @xmath7 meson further validate the observation of partonic collectivity .",
    "the @xmath7 is not expected to be affected by hadronic interactions in the late stages of the medium evolution , due to its small interaction cross section with non - strange hadrons  @xcite .",
    "all of the @xmath0 measurements referenced above were performed using the event plane method @xcite . in phenix",
    "the event plane was determined at forward and backward pseudorapidities ( @xmath3 = 3.13.9 ) with the assumption that correlations induced by elliptic flow dominate over all other non - flow correlations @xcite .",
    "non - flow correlations are those which are not correlated with the reaction plane .",
    "common sources of non - flow correlations include jets , the near - side ridge , quantum correlations and resonance decays .",
    "simulation studies  @xcite have shown that the correlations from jets and dijets become negligible when the rapidity separation between the particles and the event plane is greater than three units .",
    "thus we expect that the event plane at forward pseudorapidities @xmath3",
    "= 3.13.9 in the phenix experiment would not have significant jet - correlation with particles measured within the phenix central arm spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity window @xmath16 .",
    "phobos has observed that in central au+au collisions there is a ridge of particles  @xcite that are correlated in azimuthal angle with a high-@xmath17 particle and that this ridge of particles extends to @xmath18 ( for mid - rapidity triggers ) .",
    "the ridge could produce a non - flow correlation that we can provide information by using our @xmath0 measurements that are made with different techniques and at different rapidities .",
    "event - by - event flow fluctuations can also affect the magnitude of the extracted flow signal  @xcite .",
    "this occurs because the event plane at forward pseudorapidities is reconstructed using particles from participant nucleons whose positions fluctuate event - by - event . assuming that @xmath0 fluctuates according to a gaussian distribution , the @xmath0 fluctuation is proportional to the fluctuation of the initial geometry .",
    "this effect scales as @xmath19 , where denotes the number of participant nucleons .",
    "the difference between @xmath0 values obtained from different methods can be quantitatively understood in terms of non - flow and fluctuation effects  @xcite .",
    "hence in this paper we will compare the @xmath0 results from the event plane determined at two different pseudorapidities with the goal to investigate the sensitivity of @xmath0 to non - flow and fluctuation effects .",
    "additionally , we extract the elliptic flow with the two - particle cumulant method , which is expected to have higher sensitivity to non - flow contributions to @xmath0 .    in this paper , we describe the phenix measurements of elliptic flow ( @xmath0 ) at midrapidity ( @xmath16 ) in au+aucollisions at = 200 gev obtained from a cumulant analysis of two - particle azimuthal correlations and the event plane method over a broad range of (= 0.28 gev/@xmath2 ) and centrality ( 060% ) .",

    "the phenix detector consists of two central spectrometer arms at midrapidity that are designated east and west for their location relative to the interaction region , and two muon spectrometers at forward rapidity , similarly called north and south .",
    "a detailed description of the phenix detector can be found in ref .",
    "the layout of the phenix detector during data taking in 2004 is shown in fig .",

    "each central spectrometer arm covers a pseudorapidity range of @xmath16 subtending @xmath20 degrees in azimuth and is designed to detect electrons , photons and charged hadrons .",
    "charged particles are tracked by drift chambers ( dc ) positioned between 2.0 m and 2.4 m radially outward from the beam axis and layers of multi - wire proportional chambers with pad readout ( two in the east arm and three in the west arm ) pc1 , pc2 and pc3 located at a radial distance of 2.4 m , 4.2 m and 5 m , respectively .",
    "particle identification is provided by ring imaging @xmath21erenkov counters ( rich ) , a time - of - flight scintillator wall ( tof ) , and two types of electromagnetic calorimeters ( emcal ) , the lead scintillator ( pbsc ) and lead glass ( pbgl ) .",
    "the detectors used to characterize each event are the beam - beam counters ( bbcs )  @xcite and the zero - degree calorimeters ( zdcs )  @xcite .",
    "these detectors are used to determine the time of the collision , the position of the collision vertex along the beam axis and the collision centrality and also provide the event trigger . in this analysis",
    "the bbcs are also used to determine the event plane .",
    "each bbc is composed of 64 elements and a single bbc element consists of a one - inch diameter mesh dynode photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) mounted on a 3 cm long quartz radiator .",
    "the bbcs are installed on the north and south sides of the collision point along the beam axis at a distance of 144 cm from the center of the interaction region and surround the beam pipe .",
    "the bbc acceptance covers the pseudorapidity range @xmath22 and the full range of azimuthal angles .",

    "they cover a pseudorapidity range of @xmath4 and measure the energy of the spectator neutrons with a 20 gev energy resolution  @xcite .",
    "the shower maximum detectors ( zdc - smds ) are scintillator strip hodoscopes between the first and second zdc modules .",
    "this location approximately corresponds to the maximum of the hadronic shower .",

    "scintillation light is delivered to a multichannel pmt m16 by wavelength - shifter fibers .",
    "the zdc - smd position resolution depends on the energy deposited in the scintillator .",
    "it varies from @xmath24 3 mm when the number of particles exceeds 100 , to 10 mm for a smaller number of particles .        for the analyses presented here we used approximately 850 @xmath23",

    "the minimum - bias trigger was defined by a coincidence between north and south bbc signals and an energy threshold of one neutron in the zdcs .",
    "the events are selected offline to be within a @xmath26-vertex of less than 30 cm from the nominal center of the phenix spectrometer .",
    "this selection corresponds to @xmath27% of the 6.9 barn au+auinelastic cross section at = 200  gev @xcite .",
