    "one of the longest standing quantitative results in the study of galaxy clustering is the power - law form of the two - point correlation function @xmath6 @xcite . for many years this result rested mainly on the angular correlation function of imaging catalogs , measured with steadily increasing precision and dynamic range .",
    "more recently , analyses of the projected correlation function @xmath7 in large galaxy redshift surveys have confirmed that the real space galaxy correlation function is close to a power law on small scales ( e.g. , @xcite ; zehavi et al .",
    "2002 , hereafter z02 ) .",
    "the angular correlation function ( as well as the redshift - space correlation function ) breaks below a power law at large scales ( @xmath8 ; @xcite ) , and there are hints of a `` shoulder '' in @xmath6 at scales of several @xmath9 @xcite . there have also been some hints of departures from a power law at smaller scales ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but the significance of these has been difficult to evaluate for two reasons : they are usually measured in the angular correlation function and are thus integrated over a wide range of galaxy luminosities and redshifts , and the statistical errors in correlation function estimates are themselves correlated in a complex way .",
    "it has become increasingly clear that leading cosmological models do not predict a power - law @xmath6 for the dark matter .",
    "for the @xmath10cdm model ( inflationary cold dark matter with a cosmological constant ) , the matter correlation function rises above a best - fit power law on scales @xmath11 and falls below it again on scales @xmath12 ( @xcite , and references therein ; @xmath13 ) .",
    "semi - analytic and hydrodynamic simulation models of galaxy formation , and high resolution n - body simulations that identify galaxies with sub - halos inside larger virialized objects , predict a scale - dependent bias that makes the galaxy correlation function much closer to the observed power law , a significant success of these galaxy formation models in the context of @xmath10cdm @xcite .",
    "however , while the general form of this bias can be understood qualitatively in terms of the physics of galaxy assembly ( kauffmann , nusser , & steinmetz 1997 ; @xcite ) , the emergence of a power law @xmath6 is largely fortuitous . in particular",
    ", there is a transition from a large scale regime in which pairs come from separate dark matter halos to a small scale regime in which pairs come from the same halo , and a power law correlation function requires coincidental alignment of these two terms .",
    ", so an occupied halo may host a single luminous galaxy , a group of galaxies , or a cluster .",
    "higher overdensity concentrations around individual galaxies of a group or cluster constitute , in this terminology , halo substructure or `` sub - halos . '' ] thus , the best contemporary models of galaxy clustering predict that sufficiently high precision measurements of the correlation function should , eventually , show departures from a power law .    here",
    "we present measurements of @xmath7 from the main galaxy redshift sample of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) .",
    "the correlation function of the flux - limited sample shows small but systematic deviations from a power law .",
    "when we measure @xmath7 for a volume - limited sample of relatively luminous galaxies ( @xmath1 , @xmath14 ) , we find deviations of similar form and larger amplitude .",
    "in addition to establishing the existence of these deviations , a second goal of this paper is to introduce new techniques for modeling the projected correlation function in terms of the relation between galaxies and halos , extending the approach of @xcite and @xcite and building on theoretical work by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we concentrate our modeling effort on the volume - limited sample , since it constitutes a well defined class of galaxies .",
    "we show that the departures of the measured @xmath7 from a power law can be naturally explained by the predicted transition from a 2-halo regime on large scales to a 1-halo regime on small scales .",
    "we will examine the dependence of @xmath7 on galaxy luminosity and color , and the implications of this dependence for galaxy - halo relations , in a separate paper ( i.  zehavi et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the sdss uses a mosaic ccd camera @xcite to image the sky in five photometric bandpasses @xcite , denoted @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 . , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , but sdss magnitudes",
    "are now referred to the native filter system of the 2.5-m survey telescope , for which the bandpass notation is unprimed . ] after astrometric calibration @xcite , photometric data reduction ( r.  h.  lupton et al .",
    ", in preparation ; see @xcite and @xcite for summaries ) , and photometric calibration @xcite , galaxies are selected for spectroscopic observations using the algorithm described by @xcite . to a good approximation ,",
    "the main galaxy sample consists of all galaxies with @xmath17-band apparent magnitude @xmath24 ; the analysis in this paper does not include galaxies in the luminous red galaxy sample described by @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic observations are performed with a pair of fiber - fed ccd spectrographs ( a.  uomoto et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , with targets assigned to spectroscopic plates by an adaptive tiling algorithm @xcite .",
    "an important operational constraint is that no two fibers on the same plate can be closer than @xmath25 ( a.k.a fiber collisions , affecting @xmath26 of the galaxies ) .",
    "spectroscopic data reduction and redshift determination are performed by automated pipelines ( d.  j.  schlegel et al .",
    ", in preparation ; j.  a.  frieman et al . , in preparation ) , with rms galaxy redshift errors @xmath27 .",
    "the clustering measurements in this paper are based on a subset of the sdss galaxy redshift data with well characterized completeness , known as large scale structure sample10 , which is described in detail by @xcite .",
    "lss sample10 is based on data obtained prior to april 2002 , and it contains 144,609 main sample galaxies .",
    "the radial selection function incorporates the luminosity evolution model of @xcite and the improved k - corrections of @xcite ( @xcite , using kcorrect v1_11 ) .",
    "we k - correct the observed frame magnitudes in the sdss bands to rest frame magnitudes for those bands blueshifted by @xmath28 , so that the k - correction is trivial for a galaxy at @xmath28 ( near the median redshift of the survey ) .",
    "the one photometric quantity of importance to this paper is the absolute magnitude in the redshifted @xmath17 band , which we compute for @xmath29 and denote @xmath30 ( so that the true absolute magnitude is @xmath31 . )",
    "we will focus most of our attention on a volume - limited galaxy sample with @xmath32 , a threshold that is 0.56 magnitudes brighter than the characteristic @xcite function luminosity @xmath33 found by @xcite . for all absolute - magnitude and distance calculations ,",
    "we adopt a cosmological model with @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "our methods for measuring the galaxy correlation function are essentially the same as those of z02 , to which we refer the reader for a detailed description and tests . in brief , we create random catalogs using the survey angular selection function and the radial selection function appropriate to the galaxy sample under consideration .",
    "we calculate @xmath36 , the correlation function as a function of separation perpendicular ( @xmath37 ) and parallel ( @xmath38 ) to the line - of - sight , by counting data - data , data - random , and random - random pairs and using the @xcite estimator .",
    "we then compute the projected correlation function @xmath7 , @xmath39 we adopt @xmath40 , which is large enough to include essentially all significant signal at the values of @xmath37 of interest here ( @xmath41 ) while suppressing noise from uncorrelated structure at very large line - of - sight separations .",
    "we account for spectroscopic fiber collisions by assigning to each `` collided '' ( and thus unobserved ) galaxy the same redshift as the observed galaxy responsible for the collision .",
    "the main advances relative to z02 are the much larger data sample , the improved model of the radial selection function , and the improved error estimates discussed below .",
    "figure  1a shows the projected correlation function @xmath7 of a flux - limited subset of sample10 .",
    "we restrict this subset to galaxies in the absolute - magnitude range @xmath42 and the redshift range @xmath43 , so that we avoid galaxies at the extremes of the luminosity distribution and minimize the effect of redshift evolution within the sample .",
    "note , however , that the sample is not volume - limited , so that not all galaxies within the absolute - magnitude limits can be seen over the full redshift range . with our adopted redshift , absolute - magnitude , and angular limits",
    ", the flux - limited catalog contains 118,149 galaxies . in figure  1a , the statistical error bars on the data points are estimated via the jackknife resampling procedure used by z02 .",
    "we define 104 geometrically contiguous subsamples of the full data set , each covering approximately 20 square degrees on the sky , then estimate error bars from the total dispersion among the 104 jackknife samples that are created by omitting each of these subsamples in turn ( z02 , eq .  7 ) .",
    "= 6.1truein    the integration over line - of - sight separations makes @xmath7 independent of redshift - space distortions . in this respect",
    ", it resembles the angular correlation function @xmath44 , but because @xmath7 makes use of the known redshifts of each pair of galaxies , it is a much more sensitive measure ( for a given number of galaxies ) of the real space correlation function @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the general relation between @xmath7 and @xmath6 is @xmath45 dy , \\label{eqn : wxi}\\ ] ] from which one can see that a power - law @xmath6 projects into a power - law @xmath7 .",
    "the solid line in figure  1a shows a power - law fit to the @xmath7 data points , corresponding to a real space correlation function @xmath46 statistical errors in the correlation function are strongly correlated because each coherent structure contributes pairs at many different separations , and the solid - line fit utilizes the full covariance matrix estimated by jackknife resampling .",
    "if we ignore the error correlations and use only the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix , we obtain the slightly shallower power law shown by the dotted line , which corresponds to @xmath47 .",
    "while the data points in figure  1a lie close to the best - fit power laws , they do not scatter randomly above and below .",
    "instead , they criss - cross the fits , and they have a steeper logarithmic slope at @xmath48 and a shallower slope at @xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath50 of the fit , estimated using the jackknife covariance matrix , is 31.8 for ten degrees of freedom ( 12 data points minus 2 parameters ) , which suggests that these departures are statistically significant .",
    "( even though the data points are correlated , it is correct to count one degree of freedom per data point because we use the full covariance matrix in evaluation of @xmath50 . )",
    "however , the physical implications of these departures are difficult to assess because galaxy clustering is known to depend on luminosity ( @xcite ; z02 , and references therein ) , and the flux - limited sample contains a different mix of galaxies at different redshifts and does not represent the clustering of any well defined class . furthermore , while the tests in z02 ( and tests that we have conducted subsequently ) show that the jackknife method yields reasonable estimates of the error covariance matrix on average , statistical noise in these estimates can lead to an inaccurate inverse matrix and consequently inaccurate @xmath50 estimates .    to address both of these problems , we measure the projected correlation function of a volume - limited subset of galaxies with @xmath32 and the same redshift range @xmath51 .",
    "all 21,659 galaxies in this subset are luminous enough to be seen over the full redshift range . to obtain low noise estimates of the covariance matrix",
    ", we now create 100 mock catalogs with the same geometry , completeness as a function of sky position , and galaxy number density as this volume - limited sample , using the pthalos method of @xcite .",
    "the input parameters for these catalogs are chosen based on the model described in  [",
    "sec : fit ] , with the consequence that the average @xmath7 of these mock catalogs is close to the observed value .",
    "thus , this covariance matrix should be appropriate for fitting models to these data and for assessing the statistical acceptability of fits . to account for the small residual mismatch between the mock catalog and observed @xmath7 , we rescale covariance matrix elements @xmath52 by the ratio of the observed and mock @xmath53 , in effect assuming that the mock catalogs most accurately predict the fractional rather than absolute errors in @xmath7 . however , our conclusions would be no different if we did not apply this scaling .",
    "figure  1b shows @xmath7 of the @xmath32 sample , with error bars on the data points representing the square root of the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix estimated from the mock catalogs .",
    "the dotted line shows a power - law fit that incorporates only these diagonal elements , while the solid line shows a maximum - likelihood fit that uses the full covariance matrix .",
    "the corresponding real space correlation functions are @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively . since the error correlations for the large scale data points are particularly strong , the full maximum - likelihood fit puts more effective weight on the data points at smaller scales , yielding a steeper power law .",
    "relative to the power - law fits , the data points in figure  1b show the same systematic departures seen for the flux - limited sample but in exaggerated form , especially the marked change in slope at @xmath56 .",
    "we find deviations of similar form for most other volume - limited sdss samples ( i.  zehavi et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , but the deviations are stronger for the relatively luminous galaxies selected by the @xmath32 threshold",
    ". deviations of similar form are seen in the projected correlation function of the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) , as shown by hawkins et al .",
    "( @xcite , see their figure 9 ) , who comment that the deviation `` probably is a real feature , '' though they do not assess the significance quantitatively or discuss the physical interpretation in detail .",
    "the existence of these deviations in flux- and volume - limited subsets of the @xmath17-band limited sdss and in the independent , @xmath57-band limited 2dfgrs demonstrates their observational robustness , though their magnitude does depend on galaxy luminosity and color .",
    "the @xmath50 for the solid - line fit in figure  1b , based on the full covariance matrix and thus accounting for the correlation of errors , is 61.2 for 10 degrees of freedom , or @xmath58 .",
    "( a similar fit with @xmath59 is obtained with the jackknife covariance matrix . )",
    "we now show that a physically motivated model with the same number of free parameters provides a significantly better fit to the data .",
    "to model @xmath7 in a way that accounts for non - linear cosmological evolution and the potentially complex relation between galaxies and mass , we adopt the general framework of the `` halo occupation distribution '' ( hod ) and use a modified form of the calculational methods introduced by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the hod framework characterizes galaxy `` bias '' in terms of the probability @xmath60 that a halo of virial mass @xmath61 contains @xmath62 galaxies of a specified class , together with additional prescriptions that specify the relative distributions of galaxies and dark matter within halos .",
    "in addition to allowing us to understand the power law deviations found above , hod modeling transforms @xmath7 measurements into the language of contemporary cosmological models and galaxy formation theories , which respectively predict the properties of the dark halo population ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the occupation statistics of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while power law fits to correlation functions are more familiar , we consider the hod fitting approach adopted here to be more physically natural , in addition to providing a better description of the data .",
    "@xcite have recently applied a similar approach to interpretation of clustering data from the 2dfgrs .",
    "we start with the halo population predicted by a @xmath10cdm model , with parameters @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , using the @xcite form of the cdm transfer function with parameter @xmath66 .",
    "these choices provide a reasonable match to a wide variety of cosmological observations , including the shapes of the 2dfgrs and sdss galaxy power spectra at large scales where the bias is expected to be scale - independent ( @xcite ) .",
    "we compute the galaxy correlation function @xmath6 as a sum of two terms , one representing pairs of galaxies that reside within the same dark matter halo , the other representing pairs in separate halos .",
    "we obtain the projected correlation function @xmath7 from @xmath6 via equation  ( [ eqn : wxi ] ) ( with the same upper limit of @xmath67 as in the measurements ) .",
    "the 1-halo term is obtained by integrating over the @xcite halo mass function , weighting each halo of mass @xmath61 by the mean number of galaxy pairs @xmath68 .",
    "we assume that each dark halo has an nfw profile @xcite with @xmath69 @xcite , where @xmath70 is the nfw halo concentration parameter and @xmath71 is the non - linear mass scale for our adopted cosmological parameters . rather than 9 to account for our definition of halos as enclosing a sphere of mean overdensity 200 , instead of the value 340 used by @xcite .",
    "we choose 200 , in turn , because this definition more nearly corresponds to the one used in estimating the halo mass function . ] motivated by hydrodynamic simulation results @xcite , we assume that the first galaxy in each occupied halo resides at the halo center - of - mass and that additional `` satellite '' galaxies trace the dark matter distribution ; similar assumptions are standard practice in the hod papers cited above and in galaxy clustering predictions based on n - body simulations with halos populated according to semi - analytic models @xcite .",
    "we calculate the distribution of pair separations within each halo  the function @xmath72 in equation ( 11 ) of @xcite  by monte carlo sampling of nfw halo realizations , assuming that the halos are spherical .",
    "the 2-halo term is essentially the matter correlation function multiplied by the appropriately weighted halo bias factor ( @xcite ; an improvement on earlier results by @xcite ) , with convolution to represent finite size of halos , and is calculated in fourier space .",
    "relative to @xcite and @xcite , there are three significant changes in our calculation of the two - halo term .",
    "first , instead of the linear theory matter correlation function we use the non - linear correlation function , and make use of the non - linear power spectrum given by @xcite .",
    "second , we approximately incorporate the effects of halo exclusion by including in the 2-halo term at separation @xmath17 only those halos whose virial radii are @xmath73 ( similar to @xcite ) .",
    "third , we incorporate scale dependence of the halo bias factor on non - linear scales , using an empirical formula @xmath74^{-0.5 } b^2_{h,{\\rm lin}}(m)$ ] obtained by matching the halo correlation functions of the gif @xmath10cdm simulation @xcite . here",
    "@xmath75 is the non - linear matter correlation function , and @xmath76 is the large scale bias factor given by @xcite for halos of mass @xmath61 .",
    "the ratio of the non - linear @xmath75 to the linear theory @xmath6 is @xmath77 on scales of several @xmath9 , so it is essential to use the former when modeling data with the precision of the sdss measurements .",
    "once the non - linear @xmath75 is used , it is essential to account for halo exclusion and scale - dependent bias to obtain acceptable results on small scales .",
    "we present a test of the accuracy of our analytic approximation in the appendix , demonstrating that it is adequate to our purposes in this paper .    for the halo occupation distribution itself ,",
    "we adopt a simple model loosely motivated by results from smoothed particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) simulations and semi - analytic calculations , e.g. , the models of @xcite and @xcite , the fits of the @xcite models by @xcite and @xcite , the sph results of @xcite and @xcite , and the detailed comparison between sph and semi - analytic predictions by @xcite .",
    "we assume that the mean occupation in halos of mass @xmath78 is a power law , @xmath79 , and that halos in the mass range @xmath80 contain a single galaxy above the luminosity threshold .",
    "the theoretical models cited above predict that the width of the distribution @xmath81 at fixed halo mass is substantially narrower than a poisson distribution when the mean occupation is low , making the mean number of pairs @xmath68 lower than the poisson expectation @xmath82 .",
    "this suppression of pairs in low mass halos has an important influence on the predicted correlation function . for our baseline model ,",
    "we assume that the actual occupation for a halo of mass @xmath61 is one of the two integers bracketing @xmath83 , though we will discuss some alternative cases in  [ sec : fit ] below .",
    "as noted earlier , we assume that the first galaxy in any halo resides at the center of mass and that any remaining galaxies trace the dark matter within the halo . for given values of @xmath84 and @xmath85",
    ", we choose the value of @xmath86 to match the observed number density of @xmath32 galaxies , @xmath87 .",
    "thus , there are two parameters ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) that can be varied to fit the correlation function .",
    "of course there are many other parameters required to describe the cosmological model , the concentration - mass relation , and so forth , but all of these were chosen based on independent observational or theoretical considerations ; we made our default choices before starting to model @xmath7 and did not adjust any of them in order to fit the data .",
    "our assumptions about the form of the hod are restrictive and are unlikely to be exactly correct . however ,",
    "they are reasonably motivated by current theoretical models , and they yield a 2-parameter description that can be fairly well constrained by @xmath7 measurements . the assumption that @xmath83 is flat between @xmath86 and @xmath85 is clearly artificial , but because halos with @xmath88 do not contribute to the 1-halo term of @xmath6 , our results are insensitive to the form of @xmath83 in this `` single occupancy '' regime ; we have confirmed this expectation by considering alternative forms for @xmath83 in the range where @xmath89 .",
    "the important quantity is the overall fraction of galaxies in halos with @xmath88 , since this directly affects the normalization of the 1-halo term .",
    "our modeling approach is similar in spirit to the `` conditional luminosity function '' studies of @xcite and @xcite , but here we focus on luminosities @xmath32 instead of simultaneously modeling the luminosity function and luminosity - dependent clustering , and we use the full correlation function @xmath7 as a constraint instead of the correlation length @xmath90 alone . when other clustering measurements such as higher order correlations and the group multiplicity function are included , it is possible to constrain hod models with much more freedom , and to simultaneously constrain the cosmological model ( @xcite ; z.  zheng & d.  h.  weinberg , in preparation ) .",
    "we leave this effort to future work , when a wider range of complementary measurements are available .",
    "figure  2 illustrates the behavior of the real space galaxy correlation function @xmath6 for varying choices of the model parameters @xmath85 and @xmath84 . for each combination ,",
    "the value of @xmath86 is chosen by matching the observed number density of @xmath32 galaxies .",
    "figure  2a shows the effect of varying @xmath84 and figure  2b the effect of varying @xmath85 .",
    "the central model in each panel has the parameters that yield the best fit to the @xmath7 data points of figure  1 , as we discuss in  [ sec : fit ] .",
    "= 6.1truein    for the central model , figure  2 plots the 1-halo and 2-halo contributions to @xmath6 in addition to the total . for other models , only the 1-halo terms and the total are shown ; the 2-halo terms are similar but not identical to that of the central model .",
    "the 1-halo terms have a nearly power - law form at small scales , but they cut off fairly steeply at separations approaching the virial diameter of large halos , a consequence of the rapidly falling halo mass function . on large scales , the 2-halo term traces the shape of the matter correlation function , then it flattens and cuts off at @xmath91 as a consequence of halo exclusion and the scale - dependent halo bias described above . for higher @xmath84 or lower @xmath85 , a larger fraction of galaxies",
    "reside in massive , high - occupancy halos with large virial radii , so the 1-halo term has higher amplitude and extends to larger @xmath17 .",
    "regardless of the specific parameter values , the transition from the 2-halo regime to the 1-halo regime represents a transition from a function that is flattening and cutting off to a function that is rising steeply .",
    "thus , these models generically predict a change in the slope of the correlation function at scales comparable to the virial diameters of large halos .",
    "the strength and location of this break depend on the relative fractions of galaxies in high and low mass halos .",
    "figure  3 compares the observed @xmath7 of the @xmath32 sample to the model prediction for parameter values @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "these values are determined by a maximum - likelihood fit to the data points incorporating the covariance matrix derived from the mock catalogs .",
    "matching the observed number density of the sample requires @xmath94 , and the fraction of galaxies in halos with @xmath88 is 75% .",
    "the @xmath50 value of the fit is 9.3 for 10 degrees of freedom ( 12 data points minus the 2 parameters that are varied to fit the correlation function ) , or @xmath95 .",
    "thus , the hod model yields a statistically acceptable fit to the data , and with the same number of free parameters as the power law , it fits the data significantly better ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "the lower panel of figure  3 shows the ratio of the data points and the hod model to the best - fit power law , from which one can see that the model predicts just the sort of dip at @xmath97 and bulge at several @xmath9 that is observed in the data .",
    "= 4.0truein    the error bars on the model parameters ( defined by @xmath98 ) are @xmath99 in @xmath84 and @xmath100 in @xmath85 .",
    "these errors are strongly correlated , but the mean occupation at @xmath101 is constrained to @xmath102 , with an error that is nearly uncorrelated with @xmath84 .",
    "if we use the jackknife covariance matrix estimated from the data instead of the mock catalog covariance matrix , we obtain a very similar fit with nearly the same @xmath50 . if we use the mock catalog covariances without the scaling described in  [ sec : observations ] , we obtain a very similar fit with a lower @xmath50 .",
    "a mean multiplicity of 5.4 at @xmath103 might look low at first glance , but our luminosity threshold is fairly high ( @xmath104 ) , and this multiplicity is reasonably consistent with the number of comparably luminous galaxies in virgo @xcite and with the measured richness or luminosity of sdss clusters at a similar cumulative space density of @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "the hod model that we have fit to the data is not unique , since we could have adopted a different form for @xmath83 , or for the width of the distribution at fixed @xmath61 , or for the internal distribution of galaxies within halos .",
    "for example , if we change the normalization of the @xmath106 relation from @xmath107 to 20 or 5 , or the index from @xmath108 to 0 or @xmath109 , then we still get acceptable ( though slightly worse ) fits to the @xmath7 data , but with changes @xmath110 in @xmath84 and associated changes in @xmath85 and @xmath86 . increasing halo concentrations shifts 1-halo pairs towards smaller separations , and this change",
    "can be compensated by putting more galaxies into halos with large virial radii .",
    "we have also considered a model for @xmath81 that closely tracks the predictions of semi - analytic models and sph simulations @xcite , in which the width climbs steadily from nearest - integer at @xmath111 to poisson at high @xmath62 , with the transition halfway complete at @xmath112 .",
    "we again find that we can fit the data nearly as well as with our baseline model , with only slight changes to the @xmath83 parameters .",
    "we are also able to fit @xmath7 well using kravtsov et al.s ( 2004 ) proposed parameterization of a step - function @xmath83 for central galaxies and a power - law @xmath83 for satellites , instead of the plateau / power - law form for the full population that we adopt here .",
    "the most important lesson to be learned from these alternative fits is that all of them produce a very similar @xmath7 , with an inflection at @xmath2 that always marks the transition from the 1-halo regime of the correlation function to the 2-halo regime .",
    "thus , this interpretation of the observed feature in @xmath7 is not sensitive to the details of our hod model or our calculational method .",
    "our account parallels seljak s ( @xcite ) proposed explanation of the inflection in the observed galaxy power spectrum @xcite .",
    "we have not examined alternative cosmological parameter choices because our analytic approximation is calibrated against a specific n - body simulation , but we anticipate that modest changes in the normalization @xmath113 would still allow successful fits to @xmath7 , with compensating changes in @xmath83 .",
    "substantial changes to the shape of the matter power spectrum , on the other hand , might be impossible to accommodate .",
    "we have also investigated a model in which the distribution @xmath81 is poisson instead of nearest - integer , and in this case we can find no combination of @xmath85 and @xmath84 that comes close to fitting the @xmath7 data .",
    "thus , we confirm earlier arguments that the sub - poisson fluctuations predicted by the leading galaxy formation models are essential to reproducing observed galaxy clustering .    @xcite have also discussed deviations from a power - law correlation function , based on the real space @xmath6 that @xcite ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) obtained by inverting the angular clustering measurements from the automatic plate measuring ( apm ) galaxy catalog @xcite .",
    "the inflection point in the inverted apm @xmath6 occurs at @xmath114 , which is larger than the scale of @xmath115 where we find an inflection in @xmath7 .",
    "we have not attempted to invert @xmath7 to derive @xmath6 directly , but the real space correlation function of the best fitting hod model changes slope most rapidly between 2 and @xmath116 ( figure  2 ) .",
    "our methods are different , and a quantitative assessment of the discrepancy is difficult , so while the scale of the feature we find appears to be somewhat smaller , it is not clear that the apm and sdss results are incompatible .",
    "@xcite argue that the inflection of @xmath6 is connected to the onset of non - linear gravitational evolution , drawing on the pair conservation equation @xcite , and they conclude that the coincidence of this inflection scale with the galaxy correlation length implies that apm galaxies trace the underlying mass distribution to a good approximation .",
    "we associate the feature in @xmath7 with the transition from the 2-halo regime of the correlation function to the 1-halo regime , at a smaller , more highly nonlinear scale set by the virial diameters of rare , massive halos .",
    "@xcite model the apm data using n - body simulations by @xcite that have an initial power spectrum custom designed to evolve into the observed apm power spectrum ( using the methods of @xcite [ @xcite ] and @xcite [ @xcite ] ) .",
    "we have assumed instead that the underlying matter correlation function , shown by the dashed line in figure  3 , is that of a @xmath10cdm cosmological model with parameters favored by other observations .",
    "the correlation function of the @xmath32 galaxies is biased by a factor @xmath117 on large scales , and the bias is strongly scale - dependent in the non - linear regime .",
    "figure  4 plots the ratio @xmath118^{1/2}$ ] for our best - fit model , which is similar in shape to the `` bias function '' that @xcite concluded would be required to reconcile cdm predictions with observations .",
    "while the scale dependence is itself complex , it emerges from a simple hod model with two free parameters that is motivated by the predictions of contemporary galaxy formation theory . a strict mass - traces - light model , on the other hand ,",
    "must choose a full 1-dimensional function , the initial power spectrum , specifically to match the observed correlation function , and this function has no motivation from theory or other observations .",
    "tests of our model will soon be provided by additional clustering measurements such as the group multiplicity function , higher order correlation functions , and dynamical group masses .",
    "= 4.0truein    we have concentrated in this paper on the clustering of relatively luminous galaxies , and these exhibit stronger departures from a power - law correlation function than lower luminosity populations .",
    "in fact , hydrodynamic simulations and semi - analytic models predict just this behavior : departures from a power law are stronger for luminous , rare , strongly clustered galaxies than for lower luminosity populations of higher space density and lower clustering amplitude @xcite .",
    "however , as noted above , we find similar signatures of the 1-halo to 2-halo transition in most of the other sdss volume - limited samples we have analyzed , albeit at lower significance .",
    "we consistently find that hod models of the sort developed here can fit the measured correlation functions as well as or better than power laws .",
    "we will present these results and their implications for the luminosity dependence of galaxy halo occupations elsewhere ( i.  zehavi et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "as noted in  [ sec : observations ] , @xcite find small deviations from a power - law correlation function , similar to those found here , in their analysis of the full , flux - limited 2dfgrs . the existence of similar features in independent analyses of the two largest galaxy redshift surveys demonstrates their robustness , and the modeling presented here shows that they are physically natural .",
    "the parameters of power - law fits to the galaxy correlation function have long been an important constraint on cosmological parameters and galaxy formation models .",
    "we anticipate , however , that @xmath7 measurements of increasing precision will reveal departures from a power - law that are increasingly significant , for a variety of galaxy classes .",
    "these departures encode information about the number of galaxies as a function of halo mass , about the distribution of halo virial radii , and about the relative distributions of galaxies and dark matter within halos .",
    "we therefore expect that future measurements of the galaxy correlation function will yield ever richer information about cosmology and galaxy formation .",

    "= 4.0truein    we have used the gif @xmath10cdm n - body simulation of @xcite to guide the development of our analytic model for the correlation function and to test its accuracy .",
    "figure  5 presents an example of such a test , for an hod model similar to the best - fit baseline model described in  [ sec : fit ] .",
    "we identify halos in the gif simulation using a friends - of - friends algorithm @xcite with linking parameter of @xmath119 , which selects systems of overdensity @xmath120 .",
    "we choose the number of galaxies in each halo based on the model @xmath60 , place the first galaxy at the halo center , and choose random dark matter particles within the halo for other galaxies .",
    "points show @xmath6 for this galaxy population , with @xmath121 error bars estimated by jackknife resampling of the eight octants of the @xmath122 simulation cube .",
    "the solid curve shows the analytic model prediction for the same hod .",
    "it lies systematically above the numerical results at large @xmath17 because of the truncation of large scale power on the scale of the simulation box .",
    "when this truncation is incorporated into the analytic calculation ( dot - dashed curve ) , the falloff of @xmath6 at large @xmath17 is well reproduced . dotted and",
    "dashed curves show the 1-halo contributions from the simulation and the analytic model , respectively .",
    "the analytic 1-halo term extends slightly further than the numerical one , probably because of the absence of very high mass halos in the finite simulation volume .    from this comparison",
    ", we conclude that the analytic model is accurate to the degree that we are able to test it with this simulation .",
    "this test implies that our treatment of scale - dependent halo bias and halo exclusion ( see  [ sec : halo ] ) is adequate for our present purposes .",
    "residual inaccuracies of @xmath123 could still be present at some separations .",
    "when it comes to fitting the data , inaccuracies at this level could have a noticeable effect on our determinations of best - fit hod parameters , but their effect is comparable to that of changes in the halo @xmath106 relation discussed in  [ sec : fit ] , and they are unlikely to change our conclusions about the physical significance of the departures from a power - law @xmath7 . we have chosen to base our fits on a numerically calibrated analytic model rather than the populated gif simulation itself for several reasons : the analytic approach provides us with a well defined model that is not tied to the numerical details of a particular simulation , it is more practical for maximum - likelihood parameter determinations , and it is not affected by truncation of large scale power . because @xmath7 is defined by integrating @xmath36 out to large separations , the effect of this missing power is greater than that in figure  5 , depressing @xmath7 by factors of @xmath124 at @xmath125 .",
    "the analytic model can in principle be applied to other cosmological models , but we have not yet tested our form of the scale - dependent halo bias factor on other simulations , so we do not know if it remains accurate for other cosmological parameters . @xcite and @xcite",
    "discuss general expectations for the scale - dependence of halo bias .",

    "<S> for example , given the dark halo population predicted by an inflationary cold dark matter scenario , the projected correlation function of the volume - limited sample can be well reproduced by a model in which the mean number of @xmath1 galaxies in a halo of mass @xmath3 is @xmath4 , with 75% of the galaxies residing in less massive , single - galaxy halos , and simple auxiliary assumptions about the spatial distribution of galaxies within halos and the fluctuations about the mean occupation . </S>",
