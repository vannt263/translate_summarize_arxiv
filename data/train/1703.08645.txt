    "quantum optomechanics is a rapidly developing field that deals with the interaction between an optical field and the mechanical motion of an object @xcite . in the last decade",
    ", there were a lot of studies on the interaction between the light and the center - of - mass motion of a mechanical oscillator .",
    "quantum ground cooling of mechanical oscillators has been realized @xcite .",
    "the study of optomechanics has many applications in macroscopic quantum mechanics @xcite , precise measurements @xcite , and quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "an optically levitated dielectric nanoparticle in vacuum can have an ultra - high mechanical q @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "therefore , it can be used for ultra - sensitive force detection @xcite , searching for hypothetical millicharged particles and dark energy interactions @xcite , and testing the boundary between quantum and classical mechanics @xcite .",
    "a levitated nanoparticle has 6 degrees of freedom : three translational modes and three rotational modes @xcite . if its orientation is confined by the optical tweezer , it will exhibit libration ( such motion was called `` torsional vibration '' in ref .",
    "@xcite , and `` rotation '' in ref .",
    "several recent papers called it `` libration '' @xcite , which may be a better term as it is similar to the libration of a molecule in an external field ) . the librational mode of an optically levitated nonspherical nanoparticle has been observed recently @xcite . both translational motion and libration of a nanoparticle",
    "could be coupled with light and cooled towards quantum ground state by a cavity mode @xcite .",
    "the librational mode frequency could be one order of magnitude higher than the frequency of a translational mode @xcite .",
    "the coupling between the librational mode and the cavity mode can also be larger than the coupling between the translational mode and the cavity @xcite .",
    "therefore , it requires less cooling laser power to cool the librational mode to the quantum regime than to cool the translational mode @xcite .    in an optical trap in vacuum ,",
    "the @xmath1 motional degrees of freedom of a nanoparticle are uncoupled with each other when they are near ground state",
    ". it would be interesting to study how to induce strong coupling between them .",
    "such coupling will have several applications .",
    "for example , we may use one of these modes to synthetically cool other modes .",
    "it is also useful for quantum information , as we may use all @xmath1 motional modes to store quantum bits , and realize quantum processes such as controlled gates . by dynamically tuning the polarization orientation of a trapping laser",
    ", it was found that two different translational modes could be coupled with each other @xcite . in this way ,",
    "one translational mode was synthetically cooled by coupling it to another translational mode , which was feedback cooled .",
    "it has been proposed to couple translational and rotational motion of a sphere with a spot painted on its surface by a continuous joint measurement of two motional modes @xcite . however ,",
    "a coherent way to couple rotational and translational motion of a nanoparticle is still lacking .    in this paper , we propose a scheme to realize strong coupling between librational and translational modes of a levitated nanoparticle .",
    "we consider an optically trapped nano - particle that resides in an optical cavity . both its translational and librational modes couple with the cavity mode .",
    "we discuss the effects of cavity decay , and find that high - fidelity quantum state transfer could be realized under realistic experimental conditions .",
    "we also find that two - mode squeezing hamiltonian between librational and translational modes could be realized by adjusting the detunings of driving lasers .",
    "and @xmath2 ( b ) details of the nanoparticle : @xmath3 is the coordinate system of the cavity .",
    "the x - axis aligns with the polarization direction of the trapping laser .",

    ", we consider a system that contains an optical cavity and an ellipsoidal nanoparticle levitated by a trapping laser .",
    "the trapping laser is linearly polarized .",
    "therefore , both location and direction of the nanoparticle are fixed @xcite .",
    "the nanoparticle has translational mode @xmath5 with frequency @xmath6 and librational mode @xmath7 with frequency @xmath8 .",
    "they are both coupled to the cavity mode @xmath9 .",
    "the frequency of the mode @xmath7 is usually much larger than the frequency of the mode @xmath5 .",
    "the optical mode is driven by two lasers of frequencies @xmath10 and @xmath2 . the hamiltonian of the system can be divided into three parts : @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "such that @xmath14 where @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the energy term of translational mode @xmath5 , librational mode @xmath7 and cavity mode @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath19 describes the couplings between cavity mode @xmath9 and two mechanical modes @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "the coupling rates @xmath20 and @xmath21 are small , but they can be amplified by the driving lasers @xmath22 .",
    "we will discuss how to derive the effective hamiltonian between @xmath9 and @xmath5 , @xmath7 modes in the next section .",
    "we firstly consider an ideal system without decay . in order to get the effective hamiltonian between the cavity mode @xmath9 and mechanical modes @xmath5 and @xmath7 , we first give the heisenberg equation corresponding to ( 1 ) . @xmath23 to deal with it ,",
    "we make a semi - classical ansatz @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the classical amplitudes of mode @xmath9 with frequencies @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the quantum fluctuation operator .    inserting into ,",
    "we get the equation for the classical amplitudes @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xmath32 as @xmath30 and @xmath31 have different frequencies , we have equations for each of them @xmath33 so we can get their classical steady state amplitude ( @xmath34 ) : @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "so we get @xmath39 we can derive steady - state displacements @xmath40 and @xmath41 for @xmath5 and @xmath7 in the same way .",
    "@xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "we substitute and into hamiltonian and in the rotating frame with @xmath45 , where @xmath46 . the hamiltonian @xmath47 . by tuning the lasers detunings",
    ", we can get different hamiltonian between mechanical modes and the cavity mode .",
    "the different tasks such as quantum state transfer and entanglement generating can be realized .",
    "for example , if the driving lasers fulfill @xmath48 , @xmath49 , we can neglect fast oscillation terms .",
    "the effective hamiltonian reads @xmath50 the perfect quantum state transfer between the translational and the librational modes requires @xmath51 .",
    "if we initialize the system as @xmath52 , we can get @xmath53 if we let @xmath54 , we can transfer a state from librational mode to translation mode ( vice versa ) .    if we set @xmath55 , and in the large detuning limit @xmath56 , the cavity mode can be adiabatically eliminated @xcite . here",
    "we including all fast rotating terms , both rotating wave and anti - rotating wave .",
    "if the cavity mode @xmath29 is initially in the vacuum state , the effective hamiltonian is @xmath57 where @xmath58 @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60    if @xmath61 ( we will provide workable parameters in next section ) , and we take the initial state as @xmath62 , we can get @xmath63 in the lab reference frame , we have @xmath64 if we let @xmath65 , we can transfer a state from librational mode to translational mode ( vice versa ) .",
    "we can also choose @xmath66 .",
    "in the limit @xmath67 , we can adiabatically eliminate the cavity mode , and get a two - mode - squeezing effective hamiltonian @xcite @xmath68 which could be used for generating entanglement between modes @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "in this section , we will provide the feasible parameters in experiment and consider the effect of dissipations . in our scheme ,",
    "the steady - state amplitudes @xmath30 and @xmath31 are in the order of @xmath71 to @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , the strength of linear couplings between cavity mode and the mechanical modes are enhanced by @xmath71 to @xmath72 times .",
    "the photon number fluctuation is in the order of @xmath73 , which is relating with non - linear coupling between the cavity and the mechanical modes .",
    "therefore , the linear coupling strength is @xmath74 times larger than the non - linear coupling strength .",
    "the effect of the photon number fluctuation is negligible in our scheme .    in experiments ,",
    "the dissipation by cavity mode and mechanical modes decay is inevitable .",
    "however , in high vacuum , the mechanical decay rates are much less than the cavity decay rate @xcite .",
    "therefore , we only need to consider the cavity decay effect .",
    "considering the dissipation , the steady - amplitudes will change and we can derive them by adding a term of @xmath75 into hamiltonian . following the same procedure mentioned above , we can get @xmath76 and in order to maintain the form of the hamiltonian , we should do the transformation @xmath77 and @xmath78 . using perturbation theory @xcite ,",
    "we can obtain the coupling constants in the same way with ref .",
    "if we restrict the librational motion of the long axis of the nanoparticle in the plane @xmath79 , we get @xmath80 @xmath81 here @xmath82 is the length of the cavity , @xmath83 and @xmath84 is the wavelength and wavenumber of cavity mode . @xmath85 and",

    "@xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 can be changed by adjusting the trapping laser .",
    "for example , we choose the angle between the polarization direction of the trapping laser and the y - axis ( @xmath90 ) as @xmath95 , the equilibrium position of the center of mass is@xmath96 .",
    "we can get @xmath97 hz and @xmath98 hz .",
