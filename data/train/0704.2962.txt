    "the giant globular cluster ( gc ) @xmath0  centauri is one of the most studied objects in the milky way since the 60s , thanks to its many peculiar properties . as its main anomaly",
    ", @xmath0  cen shows a wide abundance spread ( @xmath11  dex ) not only in the light elements , but also in the iron - peak elements @xcite , pointing towards a chemical evolution history more reminiscent of a dwarf galaxy than a genuine gc . moreover , its structural",
    ", kinematical and dynamical properties appear atypical for a galactic gc , having properties more similar to dwarf elliptical galactic nuclei @xcite , and being also an elongated @xcite , rotating system @xcite that is not completely relaxed dynamically @xcite .    among the most recent , puzzling results we list the detection of complex substructures in all evolutionary sequences , including the red giant branch ( rgb , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the subgiant branch and turn - off region ( sgb , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the main sequence ( ms , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these studies have raised new questions that need to be answered , such as the debated age differences among sub - populations @xcite , the possibility that some sub - populations possess an extremely high helium content @xcite and others .",
    "more related with the present paper , we point out a very interesting study on the correlations between chemical and kinematical properties of @xmath0  cen carried out by @xcite , where stars in the cluster were divided in two groups based on their ca abundance .",
    "they showed that metal - poorer stars rotate as the majority of the cluster does , while metal - richer stars do not show any sign of rotation .",
    "they also showed that the radial velocity dispersion appears to decrease with metallicity , a very strange behaviour since metal - richer stars tend to be concentrated to the cluster center , which is dynamically hotter .",
    "a sample of @xmath1700 red giants was selected from the wide field photometry originally published by @xcite and @xcite , to derive accurate chemical abundances of stars spanning the whole metallicity range of @xmath0  cen .",
    "special care was taken to include a large fraction of high - metallicity stars , which are the less studied up to now .",
    "all program stars are distributed within 15  arcmin from the cluster center .",
    "figure  [ cmd ] shows the program stars , marked on the b , ( b  i ) color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of @xcite . following the classification scheme of @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "stars are divided in three groups : the metal - poor population ( rgb - mp ) comprising 75% of the cluster giants , with [ fe / h]@xmath11.6 ; the metal - intermediate population ( rgb - mint ) comprising 20% of the cluster giants , with [ fe / h]@xmath11.2 and the metal - rich or anomalous stars ( rgb - a ) , 5% of the cluster giants , with [ fe / h]@xmath30.6 @xcite .",
    "sample sizes are shown in table  [ medie ] .",
    "observations were done with flames @xcite at the eso vlt in paranal , chile , between the 22nd and 28th of may 2003 , within the guaranteed observing time of the ital - flames consortium .",
    "flames was used in medusa combined mode , feeding 8 fibers to uves and 132 fibers to giraffe . to ensure the maximum homogeneity in data quality and treatment , here we present the first results obtained with giraffe only , using the high - resolution ( r@xmath322500 ) grating hr13 ( 61206395 ) and reaching a s / n@xmath350 - 100 per pixel , depending on the star magnitude .",
    "data were reduced with the giraffe bldrs ( base - line data reduction software ) , that includes cosmic rays removal , bias subtraction , flat field correction , wavelength calibration and pixel resampling",
    ". the version of the pipeline we used does not include inter - order background and sky subtraction , but these have no significant effect on radial velocity determinations .",
    "radial velocities were determined using daospec ( stetson & pancino , in preparation ) , a program that automatically measures equivalent widths of absorption lines in high - resolution spectra .",
    "radial velocities are determined by cross - correlation of the measured line centers and a set of laboratory wavelengths .",
    "we used 150 clean and unblended lines of the most common species obtained from the valdvald/ ] ( vienna atomic line database , * ? ? ? * ) . observed radial velocities are the average of the velocity obtained for each line after a 3@xmath4 clipping , and the associated uncertainty is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the number of lines used .",

    "we used laboratory wavelengths of the telluric lines of the 6300   o@xmath10 absorption band from the geisa database ( gestion et etude des informations spectroscopique atmospheriques , * ? ? ? * ) to find a common zeropoint to our observed velocities .",
    "the typical correction is less than @xmath91  km  s@xmath2 , with an uncertainty of @xmath10.45  km  s@xmath2 , but we found that for some exposures there were larger offsets , up to 3  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "finally , we applied the heliocentric correction using the _ rvcorrect _ task within iraf .",
    "the resulting heliocentric radial velocities have a typical uncertainty of 0.5  km  s@xmath2 and are reported in table  [ dati ] .",
    "contaminating field stars were easily eliminated since their average velocity is 4.0@xmath938.5  km  s@xmath2 , in very good agreement with galactic model predictions for disk stars @xcite and very different from the typical velocity of @xmath0  cen .",
    "after removing all stars with v@xmath11190  km  s@xmath2 , the final sample contains 649 cluster members , with an average v@xmath8=233.4 and @xmath12=13.2  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "star by star comparisons with other catalogues yield a very good agreement .",
    "for instance , the average radial velocity difference of the 136 stars in common with @xcite is @xmath13v@xmath8=0.4@xmath91.4  km  s@xmath2 , while for the 53 stars in common with @xcite it is @xmath13v@xmath8=0.5@xmath91.8  km  s@xmath2 and for the 382 stars in common with @xcite it is @xmath13v@xmath8=2.4@xmath94.6  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "we used the photometric definition of populations described in section  [ pop ] , together with our radial velocity measurements , to construct rotation curves for sub - populations in @xmath0  centauri .",
    "to this aim , we first de - projected ra and dec into @xmath14 and @xmath15 coordinates with the following relations ( see also * ? ? ? * ) , suited for extended objects that are not close to the celestial equator :    @xmath16    @xmath17    where @xmath18=10800/@xmath19 is the scale factor to have x and y in arcminutes .    as a second step , we searched for the orientation of the rotation axis @xmath20 that maximizes the amplitude of the rotation signal .",
    "we found a relatively broad maximum around @xmath21 and thus , for simplicity , we adopt a rotation axis aligned with the north - south direction , which corresponds to the y axis and to the minor isophotal axis @xcite .",
    "we therefore plotted radial velocities of each sub - population against @xmath14 ( figure  [ curva ] ) and found a clear signature of rotation not only for the rgb - mp , as was expected , but also for the rgb - mint and the rgb - a .",
    "the numbers of stars in the four quadrants of each rotation curve show that the rotational signature is strong even for the most sparse population , i.e. , the rgb - a .",
    "assuming that the rotation curves are symmetrical around the minor axis , we estimated the rotation velocity v@xmath22 near the maximum ( as found by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as the average of v@xmath8 between @xmath23 and @xmath24 from the center ( see table  [ medie ] ) . as can be seen , the values of v@xmath22 are comparable to each other , within the uncertainties , and are compatible with previous literature estimates .",
    "if the three samples were non - rotating , the histogram of radial velocities on the eastern half of the cluster would be identical to the western half ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test shows instead that the radial velocity distribution of stars on the eastern side of the cluster has a very low probability of being extracted from the same parent distribution of the western side .",
    "more quantitatively , the probabilities p@xmath25 derived from the cumulative distributions are : 10@xmath26 for the rgb - mp , 5@xmath2710@xmath28 for the rgb - mint and 5@xmath2710@xmath29 for the rgb - a .      a correlation between kinematic properties and chemical abundances in @xmath0",
    "cen has been attempted , to our knowledge , only by @xcite and @xcite . @xcite",
    "correlated the calcium ir triplet abundances by @xcite with the radial velocity measurements by @xcite , for a global sample of @xmath1400 rgb stars .",
    "the sample was split in a metal - poor group with [ ca / h]@xmath301.2 and a metal - rich group with [ ca / h]@xmath311.2 .",
    "the metal - poor group contains mainly stars that we classify as rgb - mp , with some contamination by rgb - mint stars , while the metal - rich group contains mainly rgb - mint and a handful of rgb - a stars , with very little contamination by rgb - mp stars .",
    "the two main results presented by @xcite are _",
    "( i ) _ metal - poor stars rotate , while the metal - rich population does not show any sign of rotation ( at a 2  @xmath4 level of confidence ) and _ ( ii ) _ the radial velocity dispersion decreases as metallicity increases , i.e. the metal - rich population is kinematically cooler than the metal - poor one , even if it is concentrated in the central , hotter regions of the cluster  cen , and a possible explanation , involving the presence of a face - on metal - rich disk , was presented by @xcite . some support to this hypothesis comes from the possible presence of a small disc - like structure in the center of @xmath0  cen pointed out by @xcite . ] . a correlation between radial velocity dispersion and metallicity",
    "was also reported by @xcite , who found a similar trend as in @xcite , except that the dispersion increases again for the most metal rich stars in their sample .",

    "we simply note that there appears to be no difference in the global velocity dispersions of the three subsamples ( table  [ medie ] ) . however , the present photometric classification is probably too coarse to reveal subtle effects such as the ones presented by @xcite and @xcite , hence we postpone any conclusion on radial velocity dispersions to a future paper . on the other hand , strong coordinate motions like the rotation patterns shown in figure  [ curva ]",
    "are clearly very robust to the effect of a few outliers and can be profitably studied with the available information . even in the absence of individual metallicity estimates , figure  [ curva ] leaves very little room for a non - rotating sub - population within @xmath0  cen . to facilitate a comparison with figure  3 by @xcite , figure  [ noi ] shows the run of v@xmath8 with the position angle ( p.a . ) for the three populations of @xmath0  cen . as before , all populations show the well known rotation along the east - west direction @xcite .",
    "even the rgb - a , despite the smaller sample , is still compatible with the same rotational pattern .",
    "the amplitude a@xmath22 of the rotation signal in figure  [ noi ] , obtained with a @xmath36 minimization , is reported in table  [ medie ] .",
    "however , a@xmath22 can only be considered as an indicative value since it contains contributions from stars at very different radii , and the systemic rotation is highly radius dependent .",
    "we considered two possible reasons why the rotational signature was not found before : sample size and measurement precision .",
    "the size of the entire sample is not so different : @xcite had @xmath1400 stars , we have @xmath1650 .",
    "however our sample contains more metal - rich stars : we have 313 stars in the rgb - mp , and 336 stars in the rgb - mint and rgb - a together , while @xcite had @xmath1300 metal - poor stars and less than 100 metal - rich stars .",
    "also , the precision of the radial velocity measurements could play a role , although we have an uncertainty of @xmath10.5  km  s@xmath2 and @xcite have an uncertainty which is only slightly higher and still below 1  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "however , as @xcite made clear , the absence of rotation for the metal - rich group was confirmed only at the 2  @xmath4 level , therefore the combination of a slightly higher precision and a much larger sample size are probably enough to explain why we were able to reveal such a signature with our dataset .",
    "we presented the first results from the ital - flames survey of the rgb of @xmath0  cen .",
    "radial velocities with uncertainties of 0.5  km  s@xmath2 are derived for 650 radial velocity members of @xmath0  cen , and are in very good agreement with previous literature measurements .",
    "the main result obtained is that all the three sub - populations of @xmath0  cen show the same rotation pattern .",
    "these findings appear in contradiction with the results presented by @xcite .",
    "we show that a combination of higher precision in the v@xmath8 measurements and of a larger sample size , especially for metal - rich stars ( rgb - mint and rgb - a ) , is the most likely cause for the discrepancy .",
    "the results by @xcite were the main piece of evidence in support of a merger event in the past evolution of @xmath0  cen .",
    "the evidence presented here suggests that there is no rotational anomaly in @xmath0  centauri .",
    "the only other remaining evidence , apart from the radial velocity dispersion paradox mentioned above , that still points towards a complicated dynamical history is the structural difference among populations found by @xcite and the somewhat debated differential proper motion for the rgb - a found by @xcite , questioned by @xcite but supported by @xcite .",
    "clearly , a deeper investigation into these aspects is now needed to finally settle the issue .",
