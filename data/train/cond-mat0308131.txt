    "as a preliminar step we determine , for a given path and at a given temperature : i ) the minimum number ( @xmath51 ) of @xmath52points in the brillouin zone to accurately estimate the average interacting energy per lattice site and , ii ) the minimum number ( @xmath53 ) of points in the double time integration to get a numerically stable source action in eq.(6 ) .",
    "we find : @xmath54 and @xmath55 at @xmath56 .",
    "computation of eqs.(6)-(8 ) requires fixing two sets of input parameters .",
    "the first set contains the physical quantities characterizing the system : the bare hopping integral @xmath4 , the oscillator frequencies @xmath39 and the effective coupling @xmath57 ( in units @xmath58 ) .",
    "the second set defines the paths for the particle motion which mainly contribute to the partition function through : the number of pairs ( @xmath59 ) in the fourier expansion of eq.(7 ) , the cutoff ( @xmath60 ) on the integration range of the expansion coefficients in eq.(8 ) and the related number of points ( @xmath61 ) in the measure of integration which ensures numerical convergence .    after introducing a dimensionless path    @xmath62    with : @xmath63 and @xmath64 , the functional measure of eq.(8 )",
    "can be rewritten for computational purposes as :    @xmath65    we take the lattice constant @xmath66 . as a criterion to set the cutoff @xmath60 on the integration range , we notice that the functional measure normalizes the kinetic term in eq.(6 ) :    @xmath67\\equiv 1 , \\label{11}\\ ] ]    and this condition holds for any number of pairs @xmath68 truncating the fourier expansion in eq.(9 ) .",
    "then , taking @xmath69 and using eq.(10 ) , the left hand side transforms as :    @xmath70 \\simeq { 4 \\over \\pi } \\bigl[\\int_{0}^u dy exp(-y^2)\\bigr]^2 \\ , \\nonumber \\\\ & & u \\equiv \\sqrt{2 \\pi^3}{\\lambda \\over \\lambda } \\ , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\lambda=\\ , \\sqrt{{2 \\pi \\hbar^2 } \\over { m k_bt}}. \\label{12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using the series representation @xcite    @xmath71    and taking @xmath72 ( the series converges with @xmath73 ) eq.(13 ) yields 0.886207 which well approximates the poisson integral value @xmath74 .",
    "thus , the cutoff @xmath60 can be expressed in terms of the thermal wavelength @xmath75 as @xmath76 hence , it scales versus temperature as @xmath77 .",
    "this means physically that , at low temperatures , @xmath60 is large since many paths are required to yield the correct normalization . for example , at @xmath0 , we get @xmath78 . numerical investigation of eq.(6 ) shows however that a much shorter cutoff suffices to guarantee convergence in the path integral , while the cutoff temperature dependence implied by eq.(12 ) holds also in the computation of the interacting partition function .",
    "the thermodynamical results hereafter presented have been obtained by taking @xmath79 .",
    "summing over @xmath80 points for each integration range and taking @xmath81 , we are then evaluating the contribution of @xmath82 paths ( the integer part of @xmath61 is obviously selected at any temperature ) .",
    "thus , at @xmath0 we are considering @xmath83 different paths for the particle motion while , at @xmath84 the number of paths drops to 243 .",
    "low temperature calculations prove therefore to be extremely time consuming .",
    "note that larger @xmath68 in the path fourier expansion would further increase the computing time without introducing any substantial improvement in the thermodynamical output of our calculation .",
    "although the history of the ssh model is mainly related to wide band polymers , we take here a narrow band system ( @xmath85 ) to be consistent with previous investigations @xcite and with the caveat that electron - electron correlations may become relevant in narrow bands .",
    "free energy and heat capacity have been first ( figures 1 - 3 ) computed up to room temperature assuming a bath of @xmath86 low energy oscillators separated by @xmath87 : @xmath88 .",
    "the lowest energy oscillator yields the largest contribution to the phonon partition function mainly in the low temperature regime while the @xmath89 oscillator essentially sets the phonon energy scale which determines the size of the _ e - ph _ coupling .",
    "a larger number @xmath90 of oscillators in the aforegiven range would not significantly modify the calculation .    in the discrete ssh model , the value @xmath91 , marks the crossover between weak and strong _ e - ph _ coupling , with @xmath92 being the effective spring constant . in our continuum and semiclassical model",
    "the effective coupling is the above defined @xmath93 .",
    "although in principle , discrete and continuum models may feature non coincident crossover parameters , we assume that the relation between @xmath5 and @xmath4 obtained by the discrete model crossover condition still holds in our model .",
    "hence , at the crossover we get : @xmath94 .",
    "this means that , in figures 1 - 3 , the crossover value is set at @xmath95 .    in fig.1 ,",
    "the phonon free energy ( @xmath96 ) is plotted versus temperature together with the free energy due to the total action in eq.(6 ) .",
    "@xmath97 results from the competition between the free path action ( kinetic term plus hopping potential in the exponential integrand ) and the source action depending on the _ e - ph _ coupling .",
    "while the former enhances the free energy the latter becomes dominant at increasing temperatures thus reducing the total free energy . as a main feature one notes that , by _ increasing _",
    "@xmath93 , @xmath97 gets a negative derivative at _ decreasing _ temperatures . in the very weak coupling case ( @xmath98 ) @xmath97 never intersects @xmath96 whereas an intersection point shows up both at moderately weak ( @xmath99 ) and at moderately strong ( @xmath100 ) couplings .",
    "the intersection temperature decreases as expected by increasing the strength of @xmath93 but , at low @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) , the contribution of the free electron path action prevails : this feature is reflected on the low @xmath101 behavior of the heat capacity linear coefficient hereafter discussed .",
    "fig.2 shows the source term contributions to the heat capacity : the previously described summation over a large number of paths turns out to be essential to recover the correct thermodynamical behavior in the zero temperature limit . the small phonon contribution to the heat capacity",
    "is plotted in fig.3 to point out that the dulong petit value is achieved at @xmath103 .",
    "looking at the _ total heat capacity over temperature _ ratio , we find a peculiar low temperature upturn ( also in the weak @xmath93 regime ) which can be mainly ascribed to the sizable effective hopping integral term @xmath31 .",
    "the _ e - ph _ coupling however determines the shape of the low @xmath101 anomaly .",
    "the oscillators bath affects the electronic correlations both on the space and time scales .",
    "analysis of the thermal correlation function shows infact that high energy phonons substantially reduce the electronic correlation length at low temperatures while , in presence of low energy phonons , the electronic paths are correlated over the @xmath32 scale . by increasing @xmath101 ,",
    "the role of the phonons on the correlation function is less pronounced .",
    "the effect of the oscillators bath on the thermodynamical properties is discussed in figures 4 - 6 where the ten phonon energies are : @xmath104 . accordingly",
    "the crossover is set at @xmath105 and three plots out of five lie in the strong _ e - ph _ coupling regime .",
    "as shown in fig.4 , much larger @xmath93 values ( with respect to fig.1 ) are required to get strongly decreasing free energies versus temperature while the @xmath100 curve now hardly intersects the phonon free energy at room temperature .",
    "fig.5 shows the rapid growth of the source heat capacity versus temperature at strong couplings whereas the presence of the low @xmath101 upturn in the _ total heat capacity over t _ ratio is confirmed in fig.6 .",
    "note that , due to the enhanced oscillators energies , the phonon heat capacity saturates at @xmath106 .    according to our integration method ( eq.(10 ) , at any temperature ,",
    "a specific set of fourier coefficients defines the ensamble of relevant particle paths over which the hopping potential @xmath31 is evaluated .",
    "this ensamble is therefore @xmath101 dependent .",
    "however , given a single set of path parameters one can monitor the @xmath31 behavior versus @xmath101 .",
    "it turns out that the hopping decreases ( as expected ) by lowering @xmath101 but its value remains appreciable also at low temperatures ( @xmath107 ) . since the @xmath108 integration range is larger at lower temperatures , the overall hopping potential contribution to the total action is relevant also at low @xmath101 .",
    "it is precisely this property which is responsible for the anomalous upturn in the heat capacity linear coefficient .",
    "further investigation also reveals that the upturn persists both in the extremely narrow ( @xmath109 ) and in the wide band ( @xmath110 ) regimes .",
    "our computation method accounts for a variable range hopping on the @xmath32 scale which corresponds physically to introduce some degree of disorder along the linear chain .",
    "this feature makes our model more general than the standard ssh hamiltonian ( eq.(1 ) ) with only real space nearest neighbor hops . while hopping type mechanisms",
    "have been suggested @xcite to explain the striking conducting properties of doped polyacetylene at low temperatures we are not aware of any direct computation of specific heat in the ssh model .",
    "since the latter quantity directly probes the density of states and integrating over @xmath101 the _ specific heat over t _ ratio one can have access to the experimental entropy , our method may provide a new approach to analyse the transition to a disordered state which indeed exists in polymers @xcite .",
    "in this connection it is also worth noting that the low @xmath101 upturn in the specific heat over @xmath101 ratio is a peculiar property of glasses @xcite in which tunneling states for atoms ( or group of atoms ) provide a non magnetic internal degree of freedom in the potential structure @xcite .",
    "mapping the real space su - schrieffer - heeger model onto the time space we have developed a semiclassical version of the interacting model hamiltonian which can be attacked by path integrals methods .",
    "the acoustical phonons of the standard ssh model have been replaced by a set of oscillators providing a bath for the electron interacting with the displacements field .",
    "time retarded interactions are naturally introduced in the formalism through the source action @xmath47 which depends quadratically on the bare _ e - ph _ coupling strength @xmath5 . via calculation of the electronic motion path integral , the partition function can be derived in principle for any value of @xmath5 thus avoiding those limitations on the _ e - ph _ coupling range which burden any perturbative method .",
    "particular attention has been paid to establish a reliable and general procedure which allows one to determine those input parameters intrinsic to the path integral formalism .",
    "it turns out that a large number of paths is required to carry out low temperature calculations which therefore become highly time consuming .",
    "the physical parameters have been specified to a narrow band system and the behavior of some thermodynamical properties , free energy and heat capacity , has been analysed for some values of the effective coupling strength lying both in the weak and in the strong coupling regime .",
    "we find a peculiar upturn in the low temperature plots of the heat capacity over temperature ratio indicating that a glassy like behavior can arise in the linear chain as a consequence of a time dependent electronic hopping with variable range .",
