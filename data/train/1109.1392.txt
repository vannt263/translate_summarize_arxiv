    "the sdss spectra are obtained through 3-arcsec diameter fibers . at a redshift of @xmath6 ( which is a mean value of the redshifts of galaxies considered at the present study ) ,",
    "the projected aperture diameter is @xmath7 7 kpc .",
    "this suggests that the sdss spectra of the considered galaxies are closer to global spectra ( composite nebulae that include multiple star clusters ) , rather than to spectra of individual hii regions . in a typical case ,",
    "many individual hii regions are distributed over the disc of a galaxy . due to the rotation of galaxies ,",
    "hii regions will have different radial velocities depending on the inclination of their host galaxy .",
    "one may expect that the emission line profile in the global sdss spectra of such composite nebulae in distant galaxies can be described by a gaussian which is wider than that for an individual hii region .",
    "if two strong starbursts take place in a galaxy and the giant hii regions associated with those starbursts make a dominant contribution to the radiation in the emission lines then one could expect double  peaked emission line profile in the global spectrum of a galaxy .",
    "while double - peaked emission lines have been extensively studied in agn and radio galaxies , double starburst galaxies are yet unexplored .",
    "those systems may induce errors in abundance determinations due to the mixing of two starburst events .",
    "then , establishing the abundance of those double - peaked starburst abundances as global systems , with respect to that defined by their components , will shed light on the role and possible impact of those double - peaked emission line galaxies on abundance determinations . to this aim , we have carried out a search for sdss spectra of galaxies with double - peaked emission line profiles , revealing several hundreds of candidates where two strong starbursts can be observed simultaneously .    here",
    ", we separate the radiation of two giant hii regions associated with two different starbursts by the fitting two gaussians to the emission lines in the global spectra . we examine the properties of each component of these `` binary starbursts '' : the electron density , the oxygen and nitrogen abundances , and the number of the ionising stars they contain .",
    "these objects provide also an additional possibility to test how representative abundances derived from global spectra are for the whole galaxies .",
    "comparison between oxygen abundances in the blue and red components and global oxygen abundances will tell us something about the reliability of the abundances derived from global spectra .",
    "we test the reliability of global abundances by comparison of global abundances obtained using two recent strong - line calibrations as well .    finally , we suggest to use the classical o / h  n / o diagram to test of the credibility of the dividing lines between the starburst - like objects and the agns in the @xcite ( bpt ) classification diagram .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "decomposition of the double - peaked emission line profiles in the global sdss spectra and the selection of galaxies are described in section 2 .",
    "the general properties of the selected sample of galaxies are given in section 3 .",

    "we have also collected spectra with double - peaked emission lines .",

    "we have fitted two gaussians to the emission lines ( h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , [ oiii]@xmath25007 , [ nii]@xmath26584 , [ sii]@xmath26717 and [ sii]@xmath26731 ) in the extracted global spectra .",

    "the continuum flux f@xmath18 is assumed to be constant between @xmath19@xmath20 and @xmath21@xmath20 ( all spectra have been shifted to zero redshift ) .",
    "the line profiles of the blue and red components are approximated by gaussians , i.e. , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the central line wavelength , @xmath24 is the width of the line , and @xmath25 is the flux in the emission line .",
    "thus , the total flux at a fixed value of @xmath2 is given by the expression @xmath26    for the gaussian fitting , we have used the robust non - linear least squares curve fitting package mpfit described in @xcite .",
    "mpfit works much faster then a `` brute - force '' approach , but in some cases it may only find a local minimum . to avoid this , we calculated a set of best - fit parameters using mpfit .",
    "we have considered @xmath27 - @xmath28 on the interval corresponding to differences between radial velocities of the blue and red components from 120 to 600 km s@xmath3 .",
    "this range was divided into 160 intervals @xmath29 with step 3 km s@xmath3 .",

    "[ figure : fit ] .    we have found 129 spectra where a double - gaussian fit can be obtained for each emission line .",
    "unfortunately the value of the parameter @xmath45 given by eq.([equation : df ] ) can not serve as an effective criterion for selecting spectra with reliable decompositions .",
    "first of all , the value of @xmath45 is a measure of the quality of the double - gaussian fit to the global line profiles rather than a measure of the quality of the decomposition .",
    "in addition , the observed double - peaked line profiles are covered by about ten wavelength points only at the sdss spectroscopic resolution .",
    "hence , the value of @xmath45 may be affected significantly by the noise from just one data point .",
    "therefore we have selected spectra where the decomposition of the blue and red components for each emission line seem to be reliable , based upon visual inspection of the double - gaussian fits ( how well a double - peak is seen in each emission line ) , taking into account the limited quality of the sdss spectra .",
    "our final list contains 55 spectra .",
    "certainly , our selection is somewhat subjective , but as for the spectra excluded from further consideration here , the only lines that can not be reliable decomposed into two components are [ sii]@xmath26717 or / and [ sii]@xmath26731 .",

    "it should be noted , however , that it can not be excluded that the more distant galaxies can have slightly lower radial velocities than less distant ones due to the random component of their radial velocities .",
    "it is impossible to divide the [ oii]@xmath23727+@xmath23729 doublet into a blue and a red component at the sdss spectral resolution .",

    "the ns - calibration is an empirical calibration for determination of oxygen and nitrogen abundances as well as electron temperatures in hii regions where the nebular oxygen line [ oii]@xmath23727+@xmath23729 is not available @xcite .",

    "indeed , as it has already been noted above , at the limited sdss spectral resolution , more or less reliable double - gaussian fits to the emission lines ( [ iii]@xmath25007 , [ nii]@xmath26584 , [ sii]@xmath26717 and [ sii]@xmath26731 ) can be obtained if the blue and red components make comparable contributions to the `` global lines '' .",
    "hence , we have selected spectra with double - peaked emission lines where the intensities of all these lines in the blue and red components are similar and , consequently , the abundances are similar too .    since the sdss spectra are closer to global spectra of galaxies rather than to spectra of individual hii regions , the abundances determined from the sdss spectra are `` global abundances '' . for our sample of galaxies",
    "we can determine the `` global flux '' in every emission line as the sum of fluxes from the blue and red components , and estimate the global abundances using the ns - calibration .",
    "however , as the global flux in the [ oii]@xmath23727+@xmath23729 doublet can be measured in the spectra considered here , it is possible to estimate the global oxygen and nitrogen abundances and @xmath84 electron temperatures using another empirical calibration , the on - calibration @xcite . the on - calibration relations express the abundances ( and electron temperatures ) in terms of the fluxes in the strong emission lines o@xmath85 , o@xmath87 , and n@xmath86 .",
