    "due to the technological advances in nano - fabrication , it is possible to realize such small systems that the quantum mechanical coherence length of the electron extends through out the length of the sample .",
    "quantum interference phenomena strongly determines the thermodynamic and transport properties of these so called mesoscopic systems @xcite .",
    "mesoscopic phenomenon can occur in canonical systems as well as in grand canonical systems .",
    "mesoscopic systems are so small that even measuring probes ( like voltage probe and current probe ) can make the system a grand canonical system @xcite .",
    "a canonical mesoscopic system is well described by the hamiltonian of the isolated system but that is not the case for grand canonical mesoscopic systems .",
    "a grand canonical mesoscopic system , by definition , is coupled to a reservoir with which it can exchange electrons .",
    "mesoscopic systems are so small that the reservoir can drastically change the states of the system and this has to be explicitly accounted for @xcite .",
    "one can take this into account by solving the schrodinger equation of the leads and the system as a scattering problem .",
    "this approach is essentially known as landauer - butikker formalism .",
    "this formalism is thus different from the way we deal with large grand - canonical systems with the help of the grand partition function .",
    "for example , if an aharonov bohm flux is applied through the center of a ring , the ring gets magnetized and a persistent current is generated in the ring @xcite .",
    "this current arises because of the vector potential that changes the phase of the wave function in the ring and is another form of aharonov bohm effect which is an interference phenomenon , whereas the magnetization is a thermodynamic property is a consequence of that",
    ". one can cite many similar phenomenon @xcite .",
    "persistent currents has been studied for more than a decade , theoretically as well as experimentally .",
    "if the ring is isolated then the persistent current is carried in some eigen - states .",
    "whereas if it is open and connected to reservoirs , then persistent current is carried in resonant and non - resonant states that are typical of scattering states .",
    "persistent current has been studied in several such grand canonical systems like a ring connected to a single reservoir or to many reservoirs @xcite .",
    "if it is connected to many reservoirs at different chemical potentials , then non - equilibrium currents can co - exist with equilibrium persistent currents . in such open systems several interesting effects",
    "have been predicted , like current magnification in the presence of transport @xcite , directional dependence of persistent currents @xcite , current magnification effect in equilibrium systems in absence of transport current @xcite , etc .    in order to realize a mesoscopic grand canonical system we connect the ring to reservoirs that are at fixed chemical potentials as is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ figsys ] .",
    "the left reservoir has a chemical potential @xmath0 and the right one has a chemical potential @xmath1 .",
    "the reservoirs can also be at a finite temperature t. the ring is threaded by an aharonov - bohm flux . if @xmath2 , then there is a transport current ( which is a non - equilibrium current ) through the regions i and ii . there is however no transport current in the ring .",
    "the ring will carry a persistent current which is an equilibrium current .",
    "thus in the present geometry , the equilibrium persistent currents and non - equilibrium transport currents are spatially separated .",
    "the landauer - buttiker approach proposes that an equilibrium phenomenon like persistent current in such an open system as that in fig .",

    "that conductance ( a non - equilibrium phenomenon ) can be obtained from the s - matrix , akkermans approach may prove to be the first step to obtain any equilibrium phenomenon from the s - matrix , that is a step towards a mesoscopic version of fluctuation dissipation theorem @xcite .",
    "the correctness of eq .",

    "has been observed recently @xcite although it is not very well known to the community @xcite .",
    "for example friedel sum rule @xcite and buttiker - thomas - pertre formula @xcite breaks down in the presence of evanescent modes .",
    "so in this work we undertake the task of verifying if akkermans formula is valid in q1d . in case of akkerman s formula , in this paper",
    ", we can show analytically how the evanescent modes complicates things .",
    "earlier works @xcite on different formulas are essentially numerical verifications .",
    "persistent current in the geometry of fig . 1 has been studied earlier , but always using the wave function .",
    "the s - matrix was never used and comparison was not made between akkerman s approach and the usual wave function approach .",
    "this is done explicitely for the first time in q1d in this work to show that the 1d result can not be extended to q1d due to the presence of evanescent modes .",
    "as shown in fig . 1 , we consider a ring coupled to a wire .",
    "the scattering solution for this geometry is discussed in detail in our earlier work @xcite . here",
    "we outline some points with respect to calculating the rhs of eq .",

    ", the @xmath13 direction is along the line joining p and q. and in regions @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the @xmath13 direction is along the perimeter of the ring .",
    "one can choose different axes in the different regions as the matrix equations for mode matching is independent of this choice @xcite .",

    "so @xmath29 .",
    "hence , in the first mode , @xmath30 is the propagating wave - vector and in the second mode @xmath31 is the propagating wave - vector . we have chosen @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    when electrons are incident along region @xmath21 ( in fig [ figsys ] ) in the first mode the scattering problem can be solved exactly .",

    ".    note that at @xmath51 and @xmath52 we have a three legged junction that is schematically shown in fig .",
    "@xmath53 . in a previous work",
    "@xcite we proposed a form of junction scattering matrix @xmath54 for a two channel quantum wire that can be easily generalized to any number of channels .",
    "for the @xmath6 potential impurity at x we use the scattering matrix @xmath55 that was derived by bagwell @xcite .",
    "one can match the wavefunctions and conserve the currents by using these @xmath4-matrices that give us a set of linear euations .",
    "we calculate the coefficients @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath16 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 numerically by matrix inversion .",
    "persistent current can be computed from the wave - function .",
    "@xmath56 here the index @xmath57 implies that this is the current due to an incident electron in @xmath57 channel on the left .",
    "similarly currents are generated due to incident electron in @xmath57 channel on the right , @xmath58 channel on the left and @xmath58 channel on the right .",
    "so the net observable persistent current is @xmath59 from eq .",
    "[ eqiwf ] we get @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",

    "[ eqiwfk1k2 ] and [ eqis ] ) are actually differential currents in an infinitesimal energy range @xmath71 .",
    "the integration of these will give the actual measurable currents .",
    "the integration limits depend on the chemical potential @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "temperature can be included through fermi function .",
    "all expressions so far is derived for both modes being propagating .",
    "earlier it was shown that @xmath72 for one dimensional ring coupled to a reservoir @xcite .",
    "we shall show below that when all modes are propagating then one gets @xmath73 , but not when we include evanescent modes .",
    "this is because when evanescent modes are present then some expressions can be analytically continued to include evanescent modes but not all of them .",
    "@xmath16 is the energy of incidence that can be varied as an external parameter by tuning the chemical potentials of the reservoirs . when @xmath74 , then it can be seen from eq .",
    "[ mo2 ] and eqs . 8",
    "- 12 that @xmath58 mode becomes evanescent . eqs . 8",
    "- 12 are still solutions to schrodinger eq .",
    "[ eqsep1 ] implying electrons in the ring can be coupled to an evanescent channel due to scattering @xcite .",
    "a single impurity can couple an electron to the evanescent second channel .",
    "scattering at the junctions can also couple an electron to the evanescent second channel .",
    "no electron can be incident from ( or emitted to ) @xmath75 along the evanescent 2nd channel .",
    "so the scattering problem has to be solved with an incident electron in @xmath57 mode in the left lead and an outgoing electron in @xmath57 mode in the right lead .",
    "hence the @xmath4 matrix becomes @xmath76 and is given by @xmath77 although the @xmath4 matrix is @xmath78 , its calculation has to be done by using the 6x6 junction s - matrix @xmath54 that is defined in ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] and the 4x4 s - matrix @xmath55 for the @xmath6 function potential that is defined in ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] .",
    "this is essential because evanescent modes can be coupled inside the ring without violating any physical principle like conservation of energy .",
    "@xmath39 , @xmath37 etc are also non - zero , but they do not carry any current",
    ". they are not s - matrix elements any more .",
    "rather they define the coupling to evanescent modes .",
    "unitarity should imply @xmath79 and indeed we get this from the junction matrix defined by @xmath54 .",
    "this implies that @xmath54 is appropriate for accounting for realistic multichannel situations .",
    "in a real system , there are always propagating modes as well as evanescent modes . as is evident from eqs .",
    "[ mo1 ] and [ mo2 ] , evanescent modes have higher transverse energy than the propagating modes .",
    "also higher the @xmath80 value of the evanescent mode , higher is its transverse energy .",
    "this energy is at the cost of the propagation energy which becomes more and more negative for higher @xmath80 evanescent modes .",
    "there will be a natural cut off as very high energies can not be realized in a quantum wire . in our simplistic approach",
    "we will first consider a case when there are two modes in the wire , both being propagating .",
    "we will then consider a case when one mode is propagating and the other is evanescent . in the first case we will verify that akkerman s approach gives exactly the same result as the current calculated from the wave - function ( i.e. , @xmath73 ) . in the second case",
    "there are complexities .",
    "it will be argued that such complexities will persist in a real system where there will be many evanescent modes .",
    "_ when both modes are propagating : _ first we consider the energy range @xmath81 ( i.e. @xmath82 ) . substituting this e in eqs .",
    "[ mo1 ] and [ mo2 ] we can see that both the modes are propagating . the nature of current is plotted in fig [ figprc ] .",
    "the figure shows that the current @xmath3 obtained from akkerman s formula ( that is from @xmath4-matrix ) is identical with @xmath83 ( that is from wave function ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are individually identical with @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "[ figpik1 ] and fig .",
    "[ figpik2 ] .",
    "this implies that @xmath86 is the same algebraic expression as @xmath84 .",
    "similarly for @xmath87 and @xmath85 . and also @xmath3 and @xmath83 are the same algebraic expressions .    _ when one mode is evanescent : _ now consider the energy range @xmath74 ( i.e. @xmath88 ) so that @xmath89 becomes imaginary ( @xmath90 ) while @xmath91 remains real . in this regime",
    "the ring contains one propagating and one evanescent mode .",
    "evanescent mode current can be calculated by directly applying eqn .",
    "[ eqiwf ] to evanescent mode wave functions or it can be calculated by analytically continuing propagating mode current [ eqiwfk1k2 ] to below the barrier ( that is @xmath90 ) . we have already argued that @xmath3 and @xmath83 are the same algebraic expression . under the transformation @xmath90 ,",
    "applied to both @xmath3 and @xmath83 , they definitely remain the same algebraic expression .",
    "however , akkerman s formula takes a different meaning in this regime where there are evanescent modes .",
    "this is essential because the akkerman s formula in eq .",
    "[ ja ] is related to the s - matrix and the transformed expression ( @xmath92 ) can not be obtained from the s - matrix .",
    "we know that no electron can be incident along the evanescent channel .",
    "so @xmath87 and @xmath85 are zero .",
    "so @xmath83 is now just equal to @xmath86 , where @xmath58 has been analytically continued . if one assumes that in this regime @xmath3 is equal to @xmath84 where @xmath58 is analytically continued , then obviously once again @xmath73 , as they are the same algebraic expression",
    "however , one can see that @xmath84 ( see eq .",
    "[ eqisk1 ] ) can not be obtained by substituting the s - matrix ( eq . [ eqs ] ) , into akkerman s formula ( eq . [ ja ] ) .",
    "if we do this substitution , then we will get the first term and the third term in eq .",
    "[ eqisk1 ] ( where of course @xmath93 transformation is taken care of )",
    ". we will not get the 2nd and 4th terms as @xmath94 and @xmath95 are not s - matrix elements any more .",
    "in fact , we see from fig [ figpic ] that the difference between @xmath3 and @xmath83 is quite large .",
    "since @xmath3 is now reduced to just two terms , one may ask the question that will it give the partial current in the propagating channel only . because this partial current also consists of two terms only . note from eqn .",
    "[ eqiwfk1 ] that the total current @xmath96 , where @xmath97 , @xmath16 and @xmath44 being the wave function amplitudes in the propagating channel and @xmath98 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 being the wave function amplitudes in the evanescent channel .",
    "we have plotted @xmath99 in fig .",
    "[ figpisi1 ] .",
    "the figure shows that @xmath3 differs from @xmath99 .",
    "so it is confirmed that @xmath3 obtained from eq .",
    "[ ja ] neither give the total measurable current of the system nor the partial current through the propagating channel .",
    "for realistic mesoscopic rings connected to leads , there are always evanescent modes .",
    "the s - matrix is always defined by the propagating modes only . for such systems one can not directly apply akkerman s formula .",
    "instead one should start with a model where all the modes are made propagating .",
    "one should apply akkerman s formula to the s - matrix of this system and then analytically continue this expression for the current to the situation where an appropriate number of modes are evanescent . while the landauer - buttiker approach is still inevitable as the evanescent modes are obtained due to an incident electron that is scattered to evanescent modes , the formula given in eq .",
    "1 is no longer strictly valid in presence of evanescent modes .",
