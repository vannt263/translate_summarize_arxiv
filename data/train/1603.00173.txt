    "quantum machine learning aims at merging the methods from quantum information processing and pattern recognition to provide new solutions for problems in the areas of pattern recognition and image understanding  @xcite . in the first aspect the research in this area",
    "is focused on the application of the methods of quantum information processing  @xcite for solving problems related to classification and clustering  @xcite .",
    "one of the possible directions in this field is to provide a representation of computational models using quantum mechanical concepts . from the other perspective",
    "the methods for classification developed in computer engineering are used to find solutions for problems like quantum state discrimination  @xcite , which ares tightly connected with the recent developments in quantum cryptography .",
    "+ using quantum states for the purpose of representing patterns is naturally motivated by the possibility to exploit quantum algorithms to boost the computational intensive parts of the classification process .",
    "in particular , it has been demonstrated that quantum algorithms can be used to improve the time complexity of the @xmath2__nearest neighbor _ _ ( @xmath3nn ) method . using the algorithms presented in @xcite it is possible to obtain polynomial reductions in query complexity in comparison to the corresponding classical algorithm .",
    "another motivation comes from the possibility of using quantum - inspired algorithms for the purpose of solving classical problems .",
    "such an approach has been exploited by various authors . in @xcite authors",
    "propose an extension of gaussian mixture models by using the statistical mechanics point of view . in their approach",
    "the probability density functions of conventional gaussian mixture models are expressed by using density matrix representations . on the other hand , in @xcite authors",
    "utilize the quantum representation of images to construct measurements used for classification",
    ". such approach might be particularly useful for the physical implementation of the classification procedure on quantum machines .    in the last few years , many efforts to apply the quantum formalism to non - microscopic contexts @xcite and to signal processing @xcite have been made .",
    "moreover , some attempts to connect quantum information to pattern recognition can be found in @xcite .",
    "exhaustive survey and bibliography of the developments concerning applications of quantum computing in computational intelligence are provided in @xcite . even if these results seem to suggest some possible computational advantages of an approach of this sort , an extensive and universally recognized treatment of the topic is still missing @xcite .",
    "the main contribution of our work is the introduction of a new framework to encode the classification process by means of the mathematical language of density matrices  @xcite .",
    "we show that this representation leads to two different developments : @xmath0 it enables us to provide a representation of the _ nearest mean classifier _",
    "( nmc ) in terms of quantum objects ; @xmath4 it can be used to introduce a _ quantum classifier _ ( qc ) that can provide a significative improvement of the performances on a classical computer with respect to the nmc .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : pre ] basic notions of quantum information and pattern recognition are introduced . in section [ sec : pdp ] we formalize the correspondence between arbitrary two - feature patterns and pure density operators and we define the notion of _ density pattern_. in section [ sec : cp ] we provide a representation of nmc by using density patterns and by the introduction of an _ ad hoc _ definition of distance between quantum states . in section [ qcp ]",
    "is devoted to describe a new quantum classifier qc that has not a classical counterpart in the standard classification process .",
    "numerical simulations for both qc and nmc are presented . in section [ sec : general ] a geometrical idea to generalize the model to arbitrary @xmath5-feature patterns is proposed .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : concl ] concluding remarks and further developments are discussed .",
    "in the standard quantum information theory @xcite , the states of physical systems are described by unit vectors and their evolution is expressed in term of unitary matrices ( _ i.e. _  quantum gates ) . however",
    ", this representation can be applied for an ideal case only , because it does not take into account some unavoidable physical phenomena , such as interactions with the environment and irreversible transformations . in modern quantum information theory",
    "@xcite , another approach is adopted .",
    "the states of physical systems are described by density operators  also called _ mixed states _",
    "@xcite  and their evolution is described by quantum operations .",
    "the space @xmath6 of density operators for @xmath5-dimensional system consists of positive semidefinite matrices with unit trace .",
    "a quantum state can be _ pure _ or _",
    "mixed_. we say that a state of a physical system is pure if it represents `` maximal '' information about the system , _",
    "i.e. _  an information that can not be improved by further observations . a probabilistic mixture of pure states is said to be a _",
    "mixed _ state .",
    "generally , both pure and mixed states are represented by density operators , that are positive and hermitian operators ( with unitary trace ) living in a @xmath5-dimensional complex hilbert space @xmath7 .",
    "formally , a density operator @xmath8 is pure iff @xmath9 and it is mixed iff @xmath10 .",
    "+ if we confine ourselves in the @xmath11-dimensional hilbert space @xmath7 , a suitable representation of an arbitrary density operator @xmath12 is provided by @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the pauli matrices .",
    "this expression comes to be useful in order to provide a geometrical representation of @xmath8 .",
    "indeed , each density operator @xmath12 can be geometrically represented as a point of a radius - one sphere centered in the origin ( the so called _ bloch sphere _ ) , whose coordinates ( _ i.e. _  _ pauli components _ ) are @xmath15 ( with @xmath16 ) . by using the generalized pauli matrices",
    "@xcite it is also possible to provide a geometrical representation for an arbitrary @xmath5-dimensional density operator , as it will be showed in section [ sec : general ] .",
    "again , by restricting to a @xmath11-dimensional hilbert space , the points on the surface of the bloch sphere represent pure states , while the inner points represent mixed states .",
    "quantum formalism turns out to be very useful not only in the microscopic scenario but also to encode classical data .",
    "this has naturally suggested several attemps to represent the standard framework of machine learning through the quantum formalism @xcite . in particular ,",
    "pattern recognition @xcite is the scientific discipline which deals with theories and methodologies for designing algorithms and machines capable of automatically recognizing `` objects '' ( i.e. patterns ) in noisy environments .",
    "some typical applications are multimedia document classification , remote - sensing image classification , people identification using biometrics traits as fingerprints .",
    "a pattern is a representation of an object",
    ". the object could be concrete ( i.e. , an animal , and the pattern recognition task could be to identify the kind of animal ) or an abstract one ( i.e. a facial expression , and the task could be to identify the emotion expressed by the facial expression ) .",
    "the pattern is characterized via a set of measurements called _ _",
    "features__. features can assume the forms of categories , structures , names , graphs , or , most commonly , a vector of real number ( feature vector ) @xmath17 . intuitively , a class is the set of all similar patterns . for the sake of simplicity , and without loss of generality , we assume that each object belongs to one and only one class , and we will limit our attention to 2-class problems .",
    "for example , in the domain of ` cats and dogs ' we can consider the classes @xmath18 ( the class of all cats ) and @xmath19 ( the class of all dogs ) . the pattern at hand is either a cat or a dog , and a possible representation of the pattern could consist in the height of the pet and the length of its tail . in this way ,",
    "the feature vector @xmath20 is the pattern representing a pet whose height and length of the tail are @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "+ now , let us consider an object @xmath23 whose membership class is unknown .",
    "the basic aim of the classification process is to establish which class @xmath23 belongs to . to reach this goal ,",
    "standard pattern recognition designs a _ classifier _ that , given the feature vector @xmath23 , has to determine the true class of the pattern .",
    "the classifier should take into account all the available information about the task at hand ( i.e. , information about the statistical distributions of the patterns and information obtained from a set of patterns whose true class is known ) .",
    "this set of patterns is called ` training set ' , and it will be used to define the behavior of the classifier . + if no information about the statistical distributions of the patterns is available , an easy classification algorithm that could be used is the _",
    "nearest mean classifier _ ( nmc ) @xcite , or minimum distance classifier .",
    "the nmc    * computes the centroids of each class , using the patterns on the training set @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the number of patterns of the training set belonging to the class @xmath26 ; * assigns the unknown pattern @xmath23 to the class with the closest centroid .    in the next section we provide a representation of arbitrary 2d patterns by means of density matrices , while in section [ sec : cp ] we introduce a representation of nmc in terms of quantum objects .",
    "let @xmath27 be a generic pattern , _",
    "i.e. _  a point in @xmath28 . by means of this representation ,",
    "we consider all the @xmath3 features of @xmath29 as perfectly known .",
    "therefore , @xmath29 represents a maximal kind of information , and its natural quantum counterpart is provided by a pure state . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we will confine ourselves to an arbitary two - feature pattern indicated by @xmath30 in this section , a one - to - one correspondence between each pattern and its corresponding pure density operator is provided .",
    "+ the pattern @xmath31 can be represented as a point in @xmath32 .",
    "the stereographic projection @xcite allows to unequivocally map any point @xmath33 of the surface of a radius - one sphere @xmath34 ( except for the north pole ) onto a point @xmath35 of @xmath32 as @xmath36 the inverse of the stereographic projection is given by @xmath37 therefore , by using the bloch representation given by eq .",
    "( [ bl ] ) and placing @xmath38 we obtain the following definition .",
    "[ dp ] given an arbitrary pattern @xmath35 , the density pattern ( dp ) @xmath39 associated to @xmath31 is the following pure density operator @xmath40    it is easy to check that @xmath41 .",
    "hence , @xmath39 always represents a pure state for any value of the features @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "+ following the standard definition of the bloch sphere , it can be verified that @xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath14 are pauli matrices .",
    "let us consider the pattern @xmath46 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath39 reads @xmath47    the introduction of the density pattern leads to two different developments .",
    "the first is showed in the next section and consists in the representation of the nmc in quantum terms . moreover , in section [ qcp ] , starting from the framework of density patterns , it will be possible to introduce a quantum classifier that exhibits better performances than the nmc .",
    "as introduced in section [ sec : pre ] , the nmc is based on the computation of the minimum euclidean distance between the pattern to be classified and the centroids of each class . in the previous section , a quantum counterpart of an arbitrary  classical \" pattern was provided . in order to obtain a quantum counterpart of the standard classification process",
    ", we need to provide a suitable definition of distance @xmath48 between dps . in addition to satisfy the standard conditions of metric , the distance @xmath48 also needs to satisfy the _ preservation of the order _ : given three arbitrary patterns @xmath49 such that @xmath50 , if @xmath51 are the dps related to @xmath49 respectively , then @xmath52 in order to fulfill all the previous conditions , we obtain the following definition .    [ ntr ] the normalized trace distance @xmath53 between two arbitrary density patterns @xmath54 and @xmath55 is given by formula @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the standard trace distance , @xmath58 , with @xmath59 representing the eigenvalues of @xmath60 @xcite , and @xmath61 is a normalization factor given by @xmath62 , with @xmath63 and @xmath64 representing the third pauli components of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "[ ntd ] given two arbitrary patterns @xmath65 and @xmath66 and their respective density patterns , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , we have that @xmath67    it can be verified that the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath60 are given by @xmath68 using the definition of trace distance , we have @xmath69    by applying formula ( [ r123 ] ) to both @xmath63 and @xmath64 , we obtain that @xmath70    using proposition [ ntd ] , one can see that the normalized trace distance @xmath53 satisfies the standard metric conditions and the preservation of the order .    due to the computational advantage of a quantum algorithm able to faster calculate the euclidean distance @xcite , the equivalence between the normalized trace distance and the euclidean distance turns out to be potentially beneficial for the classification process we are going to introduce .",
    "let us now consider two classes , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and the respective centroids and @xmath73 do not represent true centroids , but centroids estimated on the training set . ]",
    "@xmath74 and @xmath75 the classification process based on nmc consists of finding the space regions given by the points closest to the first centroid @xmath76 or to the second centroid @xmath73 . the patterns belonging to the first region",
    "are assigned to the class @xmath71 , while patterns belonging to the second region are assigned to the class @xmath72 .",
    "the points equidistant from both the centroids represent the _ discriminant function _",
    "( df ) , given by @xmath77 thus , an arbitrary pattern @xmath78 is assigned to the class @xmath71 ( or @xmath72 ) if @xmath79 ( or @xmath80 ) .",
    "+ let us notice that the eq .",
    "( [ df ] ) is obtained by imposing the equality between the euclidean distances @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "similarly , we obtain the quantum counterpart of the classical discriminant function .",
    "let @xmath83 and @xmath84 be the dps related to the centroids @xmath76 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "then , the _ quantum discriminant function ( qdf ) _ is defined as @xmath85 where    * @xmath86 , * @xmath87 , @xmath88 are pauli components of @xmath83 and @xmath84 respectively , * @xmath89 * @xmath90    in order to find the @xmath91 , we use the equality between the normalized trace distances @xmath92 and @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is a generic dp with pauli components @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",

    "( [ r123 ] ) , then eq .  ( [ qdf ] ) exactly corresponds to eq .",
    "( [ df ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "given an arbitrary pattern @xmath78 , if @xmath107 ( or @xmath108 ) then its relative dp @xmath94 will satisfy @xmath109 ( or @xmath110 , respectively ) .",
    "+ the comparison between the classical and quantum discrimination functions for the _ moon _ dataset is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : discr - compare ] . plots in figs .",
    "[ fig : class - moon ] and [ fig : quant - moon ] present the classical and quantum discrimination , respectively .",
    "it is worth noting that the correspondence between pattern expressed as a feature vector ( according to the standard pattern recognition approach ) and pattern expressed as a density operator is quite general .",
    "indeed , it is not related to a particular classification algorithm ( nmc , in the previous case ) nor to the specific metric at hand ( the euclidean one ) .",
    "therefore , it is possible to develop a similar correspondence by using other kinds of metrics and/or classification algorithms , different from nmc , adopting exactly the same approach .",
    "this result suggests potential developements which consist in finding a quantum algorithm able to implement the normalized trace distance between density patterns .",
    "so , it would correspond to implement the nmc on a quantum computer with the consequent well known advantages .",
    "the next section is devoted to explore another developement , that consists in using the framework of density patterns in order to introduce a purely quantum classification process ( without any classical counterpart ) more convenient than the nmc on a classical computer .",
    "in section [ sec : cp ] we have shown that the nmc can be expressed by means of quantum formalism , where each pattern is replaced by a corresponding density pattern and the euclidean distance is replaced by the normalized trace distance .",
    "representing classical data in terms of quantum objects seems to be particularly promising in quantum machine learning . quoting lloyd et al.@xcite `` estimating distances between vectors in @xmath111-dimensional vector spaces takes time @xmath112 on a quantum computer .",
    "sampling and estimating distances between vectors on a classical computer is apparently exponentially hard '' .",
    "this convenience was already exploited in machine learning for similar tasks @xcite .",
    "hence , finding a quantum algorithm for pattern classification using our proposed encoding could be particularly beneficial to speed up the classification process and it can suggest interesting developments , that , however , are beyond the scopes of this paper .    what we propose in this section is to exhibit some explicative examples to show how , on a classical computer , our formulation can lead to meaningful improvements with respect to the standard nmc .",
    "we also show that these improvements could be further enhanced by combining classical and quantum procedures .      in order to get a real advantage in the classification process we need to be not confined in a pure representation of the classical procedure in quantum terms . for this reason",
    ", we introduce a purely quantum representation where we consider a new definition of centroid .",
    "the basic idea is to define a _",
    "quantum centroid _ not as the stereographic projection of the classical centroid , but as a convex combination of density patterns .    *",
    "( quantum centroid ) * given a dataset @xmath113 with + @xmath114 let us consider the respective set of density patterns @xmath115 the quantum centroid is defined as : @xmath116    generally , @xmath117 is a mixed state that has not an intuitive counterpart in the standard representation of pattern recognition , but it turns out to be convenient in the classification process .",
    "indeed , the quantum centroid includes some further information that the classical centroid generally descards .",
    "in fact , the classical centroid does not involve all the information about the distribution of a given dataset , _",
    "i.e. _ the classical centroid is invariant under uniform scaling transformations of the data .",
    "consequently , the classical centroid does not take into account any dispersion phenomena .",
    "standard pattern recognition conpensates for this lack by involving the covariance matrix @xcite .",
    "+ on the other hand the quantum centroid is not invariant under uniform scaling . let us consider the set of @xmath5 points @xmath113 where @xmath114 and let @xmath118 be the respective classical centroid .",
    "a uniform rescaling of the @xmath5 points of the dataset corresponds to move each point @xmath119 along the line joining itself with @xmath120 , whose generic expression is given by : @xmath121 let @xmath122 be a generic point on this line .",
    "obviously , a uniform rescaling of @xmath119 by a real factor @xmath123 is represented by the map : @xmath124 even if the classical centroid is not dependent on the rescaling factor @xmath123 , on the other hand the expression of the quantum centroid is : @xmath125 that , clearly , is dependent on @xmath126 according to the same framework used in section [ sec : cp ] , given two classes @xmath71 and @xmath72 of real data , let @xmath127 and @xmath128 the respective quantum centroids .",
    "given a pattern @xmath129 and its respective density pattern @xmath130 , @xmath129 is assigned to the class @xmath71 ( or @xmath72 ) if @xmath131 ( or @xmath132 , respectively ) .",
    "let us remark that we do not need any normalization parameter to be added to the trace distance @xmath133 , because the exact correspondence with the euclidean distance is no more a necessary requirement in this framework .",
    "from now on we refer to the classification process based on density patterns , quantum centroids and trace distances as the _ quantum classifier _ ( qc ) .",
    "we have shown that the quantum centroid is not independent on the dispersion of the patterns and , intuitively , it could contain some additional information with respect to the classical centroid .",
    "consequently , it is reasonable to expect that qc could provide some better performances than the nmc",
    ". the next subsection will be devoted to exploit this convenience by means of numerical simulations on different datasets . + before presenting the experimental results , let briefly remark in what consists the `` convenience '' of a classification process with respect to another . in order to evaluate the performances of a supervised learning algorithm , for each class",

    "it is based on four possible kinds of outcome after the classification of a certain pattern :    * true positive ( tp ) : pattern correctly assigned to its class ; * true negative ( tn ) : pattern correctly assigned to another class ; * false positive ( fp ) : pattern uncorrectly assigned to its class ; * false negative ( fn ) : pattern uncorrectly assigned to another class .    according to above ,",
    "it is possible to recall the following definitions able to evaluate the performance of an algorithm with tp .",

    "+ let us consider a dataset of @xmath120 elements allocated in @xmath138 different classes .",
    "we also recall the following basic statistical notions :    * error : @xmath139 * accuracy : @xmath140 * precision : @xmath141    further , another statistical index that is very useful to indicate the reliability of a classification process is given by the cohen s @xmath3 , that is @xmath142 , where @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",

    "we implement the qc on different datasets and we show the difference between qc and nmc in terms of the values of error , accuracy , precision and other probabilistic indexes summarized above .",
    "+ we will show how our quantum classification procedure exhibits a convenience with respect to the nmc on a classical computer by using different datasets .",
    "+ we refer to the following very popular two - features datasets , extracted from common machine learning repositories : the _ gaussian _ and the _ moon _",
    "datasets , composed of @xmath147 patterns allocated in two different classes , the _ banana _ dataset , composed of @xmath148 patterns allocated in two classes and the _ 3classgaussian _ , composed of @xmath149 patterns allocated in three classes .",
    "this dataset consists of @xmath147 patterns allocated in two classes ( with equal size ) , following gaussian distributions whose means are @xmath150 , @xmath151 and covariance matrices are @xmath152 , @xmath153 , respectively . + as depicted in figure 2 , the classes appear particularly mixed and the qc is able to classify a number of true positive patterns that is significantly larger than the nmc . hence , the error of the qc is ( about @xmath154 ) smaller than the error of the nmc .",
    "in particular , the qc turns out to be strongly beneficial in the classification of the patterns of the second class .",
    "further , also the values related to accuracy , precision and the other statistical indexes exhibit relevant inprovements with respect to the nmc .",
    "+ on the other hand , there are some patterns correctly classified by the nmc which are neglected by the qc .    on this basis , exploiting their complementarity , it makes sense to consider a combination of both classifiers .",

    "in this work a quantum representation of the standard objects used in pattern recognition has been provided . in particular , we have introduced a one - to - one correspondence between two - feature patterns and pure density operators by using the concept of _ density patterns_. starting from this representation , firstly we have described the nmc in terms of quantum objects by introducing an _ ad hoc _ definition of _ normalized trace distance_. we have found a quantum version of the discrimination function by means of pauli components .",
    "the equation of this surface was obtained by using the normalized trace distance between density patterns and geometrically it corresponds to a surface that intersects the bloch sphere .",
    "this result could be considered potentially useful because suggests to find an appropriate quantum algorithm able to implement the normalized trace distance between density patterns . in this way",
    ", we could reach a replacement of the nmc in a quantum computer , with a consequent significative reduction of the computational complexity of the process .    secondly , the definition of a _ quantum centroid _ that has not any kind of classical counterpart permits to introduce a purely quantum classifier .",
    "the convenience of using this new quantum centroid lies in the fact that it seems to contain some additional information with respect to the classical one because the first takes into account also the distribution of the patterns .",
    "the main implementative result of the paper consists in showing how the quantum classifier performs a meaningful reduction of the error and improvement of the accuracy , precision and other statistical parameters of the algorithm with respect to the nmc .",
    "further developments will be devoted to compare our quantum classifier with other kinds of commonly used classical classifiers .",
    "finally , we have presented a generalization of our model that allows to express arbitrary @xmath5-feature patterns as points on the hypersphere @xmath201 , obtained by using the generalized stereographic projection .",
    "however , even if it is possible to associate points of a @xmath5-hypersphere to @xmath5-feature patterns , those points do not generally represent density operators . in @xcite",
    "the authors found some conditions that guarantee the one - to - one correspondence between points on particular regions of the hypersphere and density matrices .",
    "a full development of our work is therefore intimately connected to the study on the geometrical properties of the generalized bloch sphere .",
