    "the key quantity in determining the igm ionization rate is the escape fraction of ionizing photons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this parameter controls the contribution to the uvb intensity from star - forming galaxies . in this work",

    "they showed that the mean value of @xmath16 for the 7 lbgs is 0.11 after correcting for dust extinction , and 0.20 if the igm absorption is taken into account .    in the early theoretical works , some authors studied the @xmath0 with ideally modelled galaxies .",
    "for example , @xcite estimated the @xmath0 of milky way type galaxy using a semi - analytic method , and reported @xmath25 .",
    "@xcite investigated the dependence of @xmath0 on various physical quantities , such as the collapse redshift and star formation efficiency using a semi - analytic method . @xcite and @xcite studied the effect of inhomogeneous structure of gas on @xmath0 , and showed that @xmath0 increases in clumpy systems by a factor of @xmath26 than in a homogeneous gas distribution .",

    "high - density ism is pictured to be a two - phase fluid consisting of cold clouds in pressure equilibrium with a hot ambient phase .",
    "cold clouds grow by radiative cooling out of the hot medium , and this material forms the reservoir of baryons available for star formation .",

    "this model estimates the sfr based on the local gas pressure rather than the gas density , and implicitly considers the effect of h@xmath61 formation .",

    "first we set up a uniform grid around each dark matter halo with a grid cell size equal to the gravitational softening length of the simulation , and translate the sph gas information into a gridded data .",

    "the rt scheme used in this paper is the authentic radiation transfer ( art ) method originally developed by @xcite , and the treatment is basically the same as in y09 .",
    "the performance of our rt code has already been reported as part of the rt code comparison study by @xcite , and it can calculate the ionization structure precisely ( see figure 6 in * ? ? ?",
    "usually the _ short - characteristic _ method is computationally cheaper than the _ long - characteristic _ method by a factor of @xmath75 , where @xmath75 is the grid size of rt calculation . in the short - characteristic method ,",
    "the amount of calculation is reduced by the interpolation of optical depth from the nearest grids .",
    "however the short - characteristic method suffers from an artificial photon diffusion effect .",
    "our art method is based on the long - characteristic method , and it is devised to reduce the calculation amount to a similar level as the short - characteristic method . hence the art method is suitable for the calculation of @xmath0 for a large number of galaxies . as for the scattering of photons , we employ the on - the - spot approximation @xcite , in which the scattered photons are assumed to be absorbed immediately on the spot .    in this work ,",
    "the rt equation is solved along @xmath76 rays with uniform angular resolution from each source .",
    "the number of ionizing photons emitted from the source stars is computed based on the theoretical spectral energy distribution ( sed ) given by the population synthesis code pgase v2.0 @xcite .",

    "we assume the @xcite initial mass function with the mass range of @xmath78 .",

    "our art code is parallelized by mpi , and has a high parallelization efficiency .",
    "we process each star particle in parallel , and each cpu calculates the radiation field from each star particle . in practice , we use @xmath79 cpus simultaneously to process one halo with rt .",
    "we also include the effect of dust attenuation by distributing the interstellar dust proportionally to the metallicity , with a size distribution of @xmath80 @xcite , where @xmath81 is the radius of a dust grain .",

    "the dust opacity is given by @xmath88 , where @xmath89 , and @xmath90 are the absorption efficiency factor , dust size , number density of dust grains , and path length , respectively . since the assumed range of dust size is larger than the wavelength of lyman limit , we assume @xmath91 for ionizing photons @xcite",
    ".          the baryonic gas in galaxies can be ionized by the uvb , and heated up to @xmath92k .",
    "it would be ideal to compute the rt of uvb as well as the stellar radiation , but in practice it is a very expensive calculation .",
    "let us briefly explain why the uvb rt calculation is much heavier than the stellar radiation transfer . for stellar radiation , using on - the - spot approximation , we only calculate the rt along the angular rays between stars and grids with the dilution factor by the distance , whereas for uvb we have to calculate the rt of all angular rays .",
    "therefore in the art method , the number of rays that we have to calculate is @xmath93 for stellar radiation , and @xmath94 for uvb . if @xmath95 , the calculation amount for uvb is larger than the stellar radiation . in practice , @xmath76 is greater than @xmath96 by @xmath97 orders of magnitude .    due to this difficulty of uvb rt , usually a uniform uvb radiation field with an optically thin approximation",
    "is assumed across the simulation box as a simple approximation .",
    "our fiducial simulation also includes a uniform uvb with a modified @xcite spectrum ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the reionization takes place at @xmath98 as suggested by the quasar observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and stellar radiative transfer calculations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , the optically thin approximation is very crude , and the effects of different uvb has not been explored very much .",
    "here we use following four n144l10 simulations with different treatment of uvb to examine the effects of uvb :    1 .",
    "* fiducial * : a uniform uvb radiation field with an optically thin approximation is assumed as stated above .",

    "* otuv * ( optically thick uv ) : the ism is optically thin to the uvb in the lower density regions with @xmath99@xmath87 , but completely optically thick in higher density region ( @xmath100 ) , where @xmath62 is the threshold density , above which star formation is allowed .",
    "the value of @xmath62 was determined by @xcite based on the observed sf cut - off column density of the kennicutt law .",
    "the otuv method implicitly assumes that the uvb can not penetrate into the high density regions by self - shielding .",
    "we find that this treatment reproduces the observed hi column density distribution function very well @xcite , and more detailed analyses using rt calculation supports this self - shielding density ( yajima et al .",

    "we compute the ionization structure in each halo by solving the equation of ionization equilibrium as follows : @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the photoionization rate by uvb and stellar radiation ; @xmath104 is the collisional ionization rate ; @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the number density of free - electron , neutral and ionized hydrogen , respectively ; @xmath107 is the total recombination coefficient to all bound excitation levels .",

    "figure  [ fig : ionize ] shows the ionization structure of gas in a high - mass halo ( halo `` a '' ) and a low - mass halo ( halo `` b '' ) in the n144l10 fiducial uvb run .    the gas in halo - a shows very complex and clumpy structure , going through continuous merging processes . the young star clusters are born in dense , neutral clumpy regions and irradiate the ambient ism .",
    "however , the dense neutral gas clumps survive owing to high recombination rates .",
    "on the other hand , the halo - b shows more or less spherical gas distribution before we process it with rt .",
    "star clusters are born near the central high - density region .",
    "once the halo is processed with rt , most of the low density gas on the right - hand - side is ionized by the uvb and stellar radiation . in particular ,",
    "when the location of a young star cluster is slightly off - center , it can ionize one side of the halo preferentially , and creates a conical region of highly ionized region .",
    "the high density gas on the left - hand - side of the star cluster remains neutral , and the ionizing photons can not escape to the left - hand - side .",
    "the value of angle - averaged @xmath0 of each halo is basically determined by the covering fraction of these highly ionized region .",
    "we estimate the average value of @xmath0 for each dark matter halo as follows . for each light ray from each star particle in the halo , we count up the number of escaped ionizing photons by integrating the transferred spectrum as a function of wavelength , and then divide it by the total number of intrinsically radiated ionizing photons . then the values of @xmath0 are averaged over all the rays coming out from the halo at the surface of the grid that was set up around the halo .",

    "we first take the average in the linear scale , and then take the logarithm for the data points ( i.e. , @xmath124 ) .",
    "at all redshifts , we find a clear qualitative trend that the mean @xmath0 declines with increasing halo mass .",
    "our results are similar to the trend reported by @xcite , although our @xmath0 values are lower than theirs .",
    "our results show the opposite trend to @xcite , although for high - mass galaxies , our @xmath0 is similar to theirs . in @xcite ,",
    "most of the simulated galaxies show a disk - like structure . in their scenario , for low mass galaxies , stars are born after the disk is formed , and most young stars are embedded deep inside the disk . as a result ,",
    "most of the ionizing photons are absorbed in the disk , and @xmath0 is low . however in more massive galaxies , some star - clusters can form near the edge of dense disk , and they can be exposed by the mergers of galaxies . as a result of this effect , they argued that more ionizing photons can escape from higher mass haloes .",
    "therefore the geometry of simulated galaxies may cause the difference in the halo mass dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "the galaxy sample size in @xcite and @xcite is @xmath125 , and it is somewhat small to discuss the systematic trend of @xmath0 as a function of halo mass . the spatial resolution of @xcite , which is adaptively refined depending on the gas density , is from @xmath126kpc to @xmath127pc .",
    "although this resolution of maximum refinement level is better than that of ours , their rt scheme ( otvet ) is coarser in estimating the ionization structure @xcite .",

    "this might be due to the increasing cosmic sfr density and increasing uvb intensity from @xmath110 to @xmath108 . indeed , if we calculate the radiative transfer without the contribution of uvb in eq.(2 ) for the fiducial run at @xmath108 with the same gas and stellar distribution , @xmath0 decreases by @xmath130 per cent .",
    "in addition , the mass fraction of gas with @xmath131 within haloes increases with increasing redshift , which leads to lower escape fraction due to higher recombination rate .",

    "figure  [ fig : uvall ] shows @xmath0 as a function of halo masses for different uvb model runs at @xmath108 . similarly to the fiducial uvb model run , @xmath0 decreases as the halo mass increases in all uvb models . since the ionization fraction of gas should increase with the increasing uvb intensity",
    ", one would naively expect a higher @xmath0 for the runs with stronger uvb intensities .",
    "however , when the uvb intensity increases , the stronger gas heating results in less efficient cooling of gas and hence less star formation .",
    "this reduces the number of ionizing photons , and decreases the ionization fraction around the star - forming regions .",
    "therefore these two competing effects counteract each other and self - regulate the ionization fraction , resulting in no significant differences in @xmath0 between different uvb runs , as shown in the bottom right panel of figure  [ fig : uvall ] .",

    "the value of @xmath0 strongly depends on the size of viewing angle to optically thick cloud from the source . as the source deviates from the central density peak , the viewing angle towards optically thick clouds decreases , and on average , @xmath0 increases with increasing @xmath138 .",
    "moreover the mean value of @xmath0 does not depend on the uvb models very much , although the scatter is somewhat larger at larger @xmath138 values owing to the small sampling . at the lower values of @xmath138 , the scatter among different uvb models are smaller , because uvb can not penetrate into the high - density cloud by the self - shielding effect .",
    "the results shown in figures  [ fig : distance ] and [ fig : fesc_distance ] suggest that the variation in @xmath138 is one of the key factors that determines the scatter in @xmath0 for low - mass haloes .    .",

    "furthermore @xmath0 may depend on the hydrogen number density at the location of star clusters , because the neutral hydrogen gas near the star clusters can effectively absorb ionizing photons .",
    "figure  [ fig : fenh ] shows the @xmath0 of low - mass haloes as a function of hydrogen number density @xmath142 at the location of star clusters in different uvb models . in this figure we use only the low - mass haloes that include one young star particle to focus on the scatter of @xmath0 , similarly to figures  [ fig : distance ] and [ fig : fesc_distance ] .",
    "we find that @xmath0 steeply decreases with increasing local @xmath142 .",
    "when @xmath143@xmath87 , more than 90 per cent of the emitted ionizing photons can not escape from the galaxy .",
    "once young stars born at such a high density region , most of ionizing photons are absorbed on the spot because of high recombination rate",
    ". therefore we find that the variation of the local hydrogen number density also causes the large scatter in @xmath0 for low - mass haloes .",

    "for the intrinsically radiated photons ( blue lines ) , there is no clear trend with the halo mass , and all the haloes contribute roughly equal number of ionizing photons .",
    "however , the figure shows that most of the escaped ionizing photons ( red histograms ) come from the lower mass haloes ( @xmath163 ) .",

    "observations of fainter sources are needed to capture the entire ionizing radiation from lower mass haloes .",
    "in the sph simulations used for this work , haloes with @xmath169 are not resolved well .",
    "for example , in the case of the fiducial n144l10 run , the halo with @xmath170 consists of 100 dark matter particles . in the future",
    ", we plan to study @xmath0 of even lower mass haloes using higher resolution simulations .",
    "if these low - mass haloes are the primary sources of ionizing photons at @xmath157 , the hii bubbles during the reionization epoch will be produced by numerous low mass haloes .",
    "in addition , the large dispersion in @xmath0 that we found in this work suggests that the sizes of the hii bubbles may have a large variety in the early stages of reionization .      in the present work",
    ", we find that the value of @xmath0 depends strongly on the distribution of star particles with respect to the high density gas .",
    "however , the clumpiness of ism around the star - forming regions could strongly depend on the resolution limit of simulations , therefore it is important to evaluate the resolution effects on @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , the cosmological sph simulations have a difficulty in resolving the clumpy structure of ism when the number of sph particles is very small , and the values of @xmath0 for low - mass haloes may be more strongly affected by the limited resolution . when the clumpiness of ism is very high",
    ", it may have both positive and negative effect on @xmath0 : the positive effect is that the ionizing photons may be able to escape through the void regions more easily , however those photons soon may be absorbed by the nearby high - density neutral clumps , which would be a negative effect .",
    "to study the resolution effect , figure  [ fig : resolution ] compares @xmath0 in the three runs with different resolution , as described in table  [ table : sim ] . the lowest resolution run ( n400l100 ) with a larger box size shows",
    "overall higher @xmath0 than the other runs . the highest resolution run ( n216l10 )",
    "gives similar values of @xmath0 to the fiducial resolution run ( n144l10 ) , but somewhat lower @xmath0 for the lower mass haloes with @xmath171 .",
    "given the this result , it is quite possible that our @xmath0 results have not converged yet , and we might still be overestimating @xmath0 for the low - mass haloes in the present work .",
    "nevertheless , it is true in all the runs that @xmath0 has a large scatter for the low - mass haloes , and that @xmath0 decreases on average with increasing halo masses .    in figure",
    "[ fig : resolution ] , for the n216l10 run , we had to confine the sample to the low - mass haloes with @xmath172 , because of the heavy computational load . in the n216l10 run ,",
    "we need to set up a large grid of @xmath173 for the high - mass halos with @xmath174 , and these grids take too long to process with rt when we want to process a large sample .",
    "we will tackle the systematic study of haloes with higher resolution simulations using the next generation of supercomputers .",
    "for the low - mass haloes , the @xmath0 of n216l10 run is smaller by a factor of @xmath175 than in the n144l10 run .",
    "if we assume that @xmath0 of all haloes becomes one half , the resulting @xmath155 also becomes a half .",
    "then the red circles in figure  [ fig : reion ] would decrease by 0.3dex for the n216l10 run , and the threshold clumpiness factor for igm reionization changes to @xmath176 at @xmath177 .     using three runs with different resolution , as described in table  [ table :",

    "the fraction of escaped ionizing photons coming from the haloes with @xmath184 at @xmath1 is 70 per cent for the fiducial n144l10 run .    as we summarised in section",
    "[ sec : intro ] , the current results on the escape fraction of ionizing photons are confusing , as different results are obtained from different simulations .",
    "for example , @xcite argued that @xmath0 increases with increasing halo mass in the range of @xmath185 , and their values of @xmath0 were mostly less than a few per cent , much smaller than the other published work .",
    "the trend found in our simulations ( decreasing @xmath0 with increasing halo mass ) is similar to that found by @xcite , but we find lower @xmath0 values despite of the fact that our simulations have lower resolution than their zoom - resimulations .",
    "therefore the differences in @xmath0 between our work and @xcite can not be explained simply by the resolution effect .",
    "we also note that @xcite obtained much higher values of @xmath0 ( @xmath710.4 ) than @xcite did , using the same amr method , but for a different halo mass range . considering these facts , the differences that we see now in the results of @xmath0 may have to do more with the different treatment of radiation transfer and the uv background radiation , rather than the resolution or numerical technique .",
    "however , more detailed comparisons are needed to make more definite statements .",
    "one of our main points is that the variation in @xmath0 is caused by the different geometry of ism distribution in the halo .",
    "recently @xcite suggested that supernovae feedback and star formation efficiency can determine the geometry of a disk galaxy ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "therefore the uncertainties in the treatment of star formation , feedback , and radiation transfer are all important for the calculations of @xmath0 , and we need to continue to improve these models through comparisons with future observations of high-@xmath12 galaxies .    if we allow ourselves to speculate even further and combine all the current results mentioned above , it is possible that @xmath0 has a peak at @xmath186 as a function of halo mass at @xmath1 .",
    "but this is highly speculative and by no means based on any definite physical arguments .",
    "the strength of our current work is the large sample size of galaxies that we processed with rt .",
    "our simulations also adopt a new galactic wind model which produces more favorable results on the cosmic star formation rate and the igm statistics such as civ mass density @xcite .",
    "although it is difficult to address the exact effect of our wind model on @xmath0 unless we process simulations with different wind models with rt calculation , our test calculations showed that the effect is not so strong , and our main conclusions of this paper should remain unchanged even if we modify the wind model slightly .",
    "we consider that the most significant results in the current work are the large scatter of @xmath0 for the low mass haloes , and its decline with the increasing halo mass .",
    "the earlier works by other authors did not discuss the scatter among different haloes with a wide range of mass owing to their small sample size .    at @xmath187 ,",
    "even lower mass haloes with @xmath169 may become the main sources of igm ionization .",
    "however in such low - mass systems , the uv radiation of massive stars may influence the gas dynamics significantly @xcite .",
    "simulations with higher resolution than presented in this paper are needed to follow the star formation in such low - mass systems , and we need to solve the hydrodynamics and radiation transfer simultaneously to examine the effect of radiative feedback . in the future ,",
