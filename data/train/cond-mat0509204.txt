    "geometric frustration of interacting spin systems is the driving force of a variety of fascinating phenomena in low - dimensional magnetism.@xcite in this context the term _ frustration _ describes a situation where in the ground state of a classical spin system not all interactions can be saturated simultaneously . a typical picture for such a situation is a triangle of antiferromagnetically coupled spins , where classically the spins are not in the typical up - down - up configuration , but assume a ground state that is characterized by a relative angle of @xmath0 between neighboring spins .",
    "this special classical ground state characterizes several frustrated spin systems , among them giant keplerate molecules,@xcite the triangular lattice antiferromagnet , and the kagome lattice antiferromagnet .    throughout the article",
    "the spin systems are modeled by an isotropic heisenberg hamiltonian augmented with a zeeman term , i.e. , @xmath1 @xmath2 are the individual spin operators at sites @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the total spin operator , and @xmath5 its @xmath6-component along the homogeneous magnetic field axis .",
    "@xmath7 are the matrix elements of the symmetric coupling matrix . in the following",
    "we will consider only antiferromagnetic couplings which are characterized by a negative value of @xmath7 .",
    "rigorous results on spin systems such as the sign rule of marshall and peierls@xcite and the famous theorems of lieb , schultz , and mattis @xcite have sharpened our understanding of magnetic phenomena . with the advent of finite size antiferromagnetic",
    "spin rings the question arose whether such general statements can also be made for odd spin rings which are not decomposable into two sublattices , i.e. not bipartite .",
    "a key quantity of interest is the shift quantum number @xmath8 associated with the cyclic shift symmetry of the rings .",
    "the corresponding crystal momentum is then @xmath9 . for rings with even @xmath10 ( bipartite )",
    "one can explain the shift quantum numbers for the relative ground states in subspaces @xmath11 of total magnetic quantum number @xmath12.@xcite in recent investigations we could numerically verify , that even for frustrated rings with odd @xmath10 astonishing regularities hold . unifying the picture for even and odd @xmath10",
    ", we find for the ground state without exception:@xcite _ the ground state belongs to the subspace @xmath13 with the smallest possible total spin quantum number @xmath14 . if @xmath15 is integer , then the ground state is non - degenerate .",
    "if @xmath15 is half integer , then the ground state is fourfold degenerate .",
    "_    the sign rule of marshall and peierls can be generalized for all subspaces @xmath11 with a given total magnetic quantum number:@xcite @xmath16 moreover the degeneracy of the relative ground state is minimal . here",
    "@xmath17 denotes the smallest integer greater than or equal to @xmath18 .",
    " minimal degeneracy \" means that the relative ground state in @xmath11 is twofold degenerate if there are two different shift quantum numbers and non - degenerate if @xmath19 mod @xmath10 or @xmath20 mod @xmath10 , the latter for even @xmath10 .",
    "the k - rule ( [ e-1 - 1 ] ) is founded in a mathematically rigorous way for @xmath10 even,@xcite @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and in part for @xmath24.@xcite for the ground state with @xmath10 odd and @xmath25 the k - rule follows from the bethe ansatz.@xcite an asymptotic proof can be formulated for large enough @xmath10 for systems with an asymptotically finite excitation gap ( haldane systems).@xcite the k - rule also holds for the exactly solvable @xmath26-model with @xmath25 . for @xmath15",
    "being half integer field theory methods yield that the ground state shift quantum number approaches @xmath27 for large @xmath10.@xcite apart from these findings a rigorous proof of the k - rule still remains a challenge .",
    "and close - up view of the low - energy part ( r.h.s . ) .",
    "the lowest rotational bands are highlighted by solid curves.,width=340 ]    an antiferromagnet that can be decomposed into two sublattices has as its lowest excitations the rotation of the nel vector as well as spin wave excitations.@xcite in finite size systems these excitations are arranged in rotational ( parabolic ) bands as shown in fig .",
    "[ f - b ] for a ring of six antiferromagnetically coupled spins @xmath28 . such a behavior is most pronounced for bipartite , i.e. unfrustrated systems.@xcite    .",
    "the highest four levels fall on a straight line . r.h.s . : resulting @xmath29-magnetization curve .",
    "the magnetization jump of @xmath30 is marked by an arrow.,width=340 ]    contrary to this behavior the minimal energies of certain frustrated antiferromagnetic molecules of cuboctahedral and icosidodecahedral structure depend linearly on total spin @xmath14 above a certain total spin.@xcite such a dependence , which is depicted on the l.h.s .",
    "[ f - c ] , results in an unusually big jump to saturation as can be seen on the r.h.s . of fig .",
    "[ f - c ] .",
    "although first noticed for the keplerate molecule \\{@xmath31 } , such a behavior is quite common for a certain class of frustrated spin systems such as the kagome or the pyrochlore lattice.@xcite the underlying reason is that due to the special geometric frustration in such systems  polygons are surrounded by triangles  the relative ground states in subspaces @xmath11 are for big enough @xmath12 given by product states of independent localized magnons .",
    "therefore , the energy scales linearly with the number of independent magnons which in turn is linearly related to @xmath12 or @xmath14.@xcite",
    "the observation of hysteresis effects in magnetic materials is usually an outcome of their magnetic anisotropy . in a recent article",
    "we could report that magnetic hysteresis ( fig .",
    "[ f - a ] , l.h.s . ,",
    "top ) occurs in a spin system without any anisotropy.@xcite specifically , we investigated an icosahedron where classical spins mounted on the vertices are coupled by antiferromagnetic isotropic nearest - neighbor heisenberg interaction giving rise to geometric frustration . at @xmath32",
    "this system undergoes a first order metamagnetic phase transition at a critical field @xmath33 between two distinct families of ground state configurations .",
    "the metastable phase of the system is characterized by a temperature and field dependent survival probability distribution .",
    "our exact classical treatment shows that the abrupt transition at @xmath32 originates in the intersection of two energy curves belonging to different families of spin configurations that are ground states below and above the critical field ( fig .",
    "[ f - a ] , l.h.s . ,",
    "the minimum of the two energy functions constitutes a non - convex minimal energy function of the spin system and this gives rise to a metamagnetic phase transition .",
    "we could also show that the corresponding quantum spin system for sufficiently large spin quantum number @xmath34 possesses a non - convex set of lowest energy levels when plotted versus total spin .",
    "[ f - a ] ( r.h.s . ) shows the @xmath29-magnetization curves for various @xmath34 .",
    "the magnetization plateaus of smallest width are highlighted on each curve . at @xmath35 a magnetization jump of @xmath36",
    "occurs , marked by the arrow . at @xmath37 a tiny plateau",
    "the solid curve shows that the field values that bisect the smallest plateaus converge to the classical transition field ( dashed line ) .",
    "the magnetocaloric effect , which consists in cooling or heating of a magnetic system in a varying magnetic field , can assume especially large values if the entropy @xmath38 changes drastically as a function of field according to @xmath39 this can for instance happen at phase transitions .",
    "in the context of frustrated spin systems huge cooling rates ( [ magmol-2 - 3 ] ) can be achieved for certain topologies in the vicinity of the saturation field due to the large ( sometimes even macroscopic ) degeneracy of independent magnon states.@xcite     ( l.h.s . ) as well as a spin ring with @xmath40 spins @xmath25 ( r.h.s.).,title=\"fig:\",width=170 ] @xmath41   ( l.h.s . ) as well as a spin ring with @xmath40 spins @xmath25 ( r.h.s.).,title=\"fig:\",width=170 ]    fig .",
    "[ f - d ] shows the isentropes of a cuboctahedron with @xmath25 ( l.h.s . ) as well as a spin ring with @xmath40 spins @xmath25 ( r.h.s . ) .",
    "the cuboctahedron hosts independent magnons and thus features an unusually big magnetization jump to saturation whereas the spin ring does not .",
    "consequently the isentropes of the cuboctahedron have a steeper slope above the saturation field , therefore the cuboctahedron exhibits a larger cooling rate .",
