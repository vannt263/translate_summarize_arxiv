    "in recent years , significant progress has been achieved in understanding the basic principles of the formation of planetary systems around low mass stars .",
    "most of these findings were obtained due to high - resolution spectroscopic and photometric measurements focused on discovering earth - like planets  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "more significantly , recent observations show evidence of a possible influence of the young planetary disc on the evolution of the host star .",
    "the most compelling evidence comes from high - resolution spectroscopic measurements of several solar twins , where it has been found that , contrary to what was previously thought , the sun has an anomalous chemical composition when compared to identical stars without planetary systems .",
    "in fact , the sun has a depletion of volatile and refractory elements , the effect being more pronounced for the latter , i.e. , there is a 20% diminution of refractory elements relatively to the volatile ones  .",
    "only 15% of solar twins have a chemical composition identical to the sun .",
    "it is thought that the differentiation observed in the chemical composition occurs during the formation of planets in the young planetary disc .",
    "the spectroscopic observations suggest that the refractory elements are locked up in the inner planetary belt , where the earth - like planets are formed .",
    "this is consistent with what is observed in our own solar system and is backed up by two facts .",
    "the first is that if a depletion of 30% of refractory elements is assumed to occur in the external layers of the sun , then the amount of mass removed in the convection zone is equivalent to the combined mass of the terrestrial planets , i.e. , mercury , venus , earth and mars .",
    "the second is related to the latest chemical abundance determination of the sun , a more accurate method of spectral analysis that led to a major revision in the chemical abundances obtained from spectral absorption lines .",
    "the abundances are significantly reduced in the case of heavy chemical elements such as carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , neon , sodium and aluminium  .",
    "this led to a significant reduction in the value of the sun s metallicity .",
    "such variations in chemical abundances worsen the previous , possibly fortuitous , agreement of the standard solar model ( ssm ) with the helioseismological data and solar neutrinos , namely by increasing the difference between the sound speed profiles and by changing the location of the convection zone boundary  ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , @xcite have shown that the new chemical abundances lead to a reduction of 20% in the prediction of @xmath3b neutrino fluxes .",
    "the reconciliation of the ssm  @xcite with the helioseismic and solar neutrino data was in part re - established by several research groups , by considering alternative modifications of the evolution of the sun  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . among the various attempts to solve the problem , some test the validity of the solar abundance determination  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and others revisit the constitutive physics of the solar model  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or tentatively include the impact of rotation on the evolution of the sun  @xcite .",
    "the scenarios that lead to better results assume that an additional physical process occurred during the evolution of the star .",
    "the agreement was found to be best in the case of solar models that take into account mass accretion and/or mass - loss during its evolution  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "some authors   go a step further and consider that depletion of heavy elements occurs in the convection zone of the star , explaining in this way the deficit in heavy elements observed in the new abundance determinations  , as compared with the previous ones  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the evolution of the star during the gravitational contraction phase , before arriving on the main sequence , is not well known , in particular , the internal structure of the protostar is still quite uncertain .",
    "it has been suggested that , during this phase , the protostar has a radiative core rather than being fully convective , as is usually assumed  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if this is the case , there is a possibility that the radiative core of the protostar has a higher content of metals than previously assumed .",
    "these latter evolution scenarios suggest that the composition of the interior of the sun is quite different from the composition of the convection zone .",
    "nevertheless , by what amount the composition of the different elements decreases between the centre and the surface is not easy to justify in the presence of a quite varied set of theoretical proposals .",
    "therefore , it is paramount that we find a way to constrain the composition inside the sun , and if possible at different locations .",
    "the solar neutrino fluxes have the potential to discriminate between these different types of solar models , because they are produced in the core of the sun at different locations , between the centre and @xmath5 of the solar radius .",
    "moreover , neutrino fluxes can provide a direct measure of the metallicity in the sun s core . in this work",
    ", we address the question of whether a radial enhancement of metallicity in the core could resolve the solar abundance problem , and if so , then by what amount .",
    "in particular , we will discuss the impact of the chemical composition on the solar neutrino fluxes .",
    "we believe this could help settle the origin of such a high - metallicity radiative region and/or core , and in this way we determine the mechanism which is responsible .",

    "the origin of excess of metals in the sun s interior and the mechanism responsible for their accumulation is an unresolved question : two types of scenarios could be responsible - metals were accreted from the initial host molecular cloud in the early stages of the formation of the protostar or an accretion process that occurred later on in the life of the star , when the radiative solar region was already formed ; or even possibly some compromise between the two scenarios . in the latter case ,",
    "the higher or lower concentration of heavy elements in the sun s interior is very much related to the joint evolution of the host star and the planetary disc .",

    "the sound speed difference in the radiative region just below the convection zone is smaller than @xmath200 ( cf .",
    "figs  [ fig:1 ] and  [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "this agreement is possible even without any specific considerations about the chemical composition .",

    "if the chemical composition of heavy elements inside the star increases by a significant amount , such as 30% , as suggested by solar twin observations , the sound speed difference is reduced ( cf .",

    "figs  [ fig:1 ] and  [ fig:2 ] and table  [ tab:2 ] ) .",

    "this is the reason why @xmath4be and @xmath3b neutrino fluxes increase with a decrease of mass - loss rate , i.e. , dependence on the total luminosity of the star is almost unaffected by the variation of chemical composition ( cf .",

    "distinct @xmath201-element profiles ( with radial dependence ) produce quite identical sound speed profiles and @xmath4be and @xmath3b neutrino fluxes ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) . nevertheless , there is a small improvement of the sound speed difference in the sun s core ( cf .",

    "if @xmath201 increases by a fixed amount between solar models ( compare models @xmath106 and @xmath111 in fig .  [ fig:3 ] ) , then all the cno neutrino fluxes will increase , although maintaining their relative proportionality difference ( cf .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) .",
    "this is valid only if the @xmath201-element profiles in these solar models are constant from the centre to the base of the convective zone .",
    "this @xmath201-element profile is almost equivalent to the one obtained with the old composition  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , if the @xmath201-element radial profile decreases towards the surface , the neutrino sources are progressively affected , the first ones to be affected being located closest to the centre of the star .",
    "it follows that the impact is more significant for neutrinos associated with the @xmath2f , @xmath1o and @xmath0n chemical elements .",
    "the increase of @xmath201 in the core by 30% produces large changes in the neutrino fluxes of @xmath0n , @xmath1o and @xmath2f . in some cases ,",
    "this increases the neutrino fluxes by more than 50 % .",
    "we found that different physical processes can adjust to the observed sun s present luminosity leading to readjusting the internal structure of the sun , and in particular by fixing its central temperature , in such a way that these solar models come in better agreement with the solar neutrino fluxes and helioseismic data .",
    "however , for most of the cases , the simultaneous agreement between the @xmath4be and @xmath3b neutrino fluxes and the sound speed profile between the solar model and the real data is only possible by making a very fine tuning of the open parameters related with the physical processes considered .",
    "the typical examples are the processes related with the mass loss or mass accretion by the star during its pre - main sequence phase .",
    "we also found that if the metallicity content present in the sun s interior , including the sun s core , is quite different from the metallicity predicted by the ssm ( and also by most of the non - standard models ) , then the impact of these distinct @xmath201-element profiles on the previously mentioned observed quantities is relatively small , but interestingly enough , the impact on the cno neutrino fluxes is very pronounced .",
    "in particular , we found that a solar model with a significant increase in abundances such as carbon , oxygen and nitrogen of the order of @xmath215 , as suggested by solar twins observations ( or even a higher increase of these abundances ) , still presents an internal structure for the present sun quite close to the ssm .",
    "the impact of these high metallicity profiles in the @xmath4be and @xmath3b neutrino fluxes and helioseismology data is moderate , but its impact on the cno neutrino fluxes is quite large .",
    "the future measurements of cno neutrino fluxes could resolve this problem .    the new generation of neutrino experiments , such as the sno , borexino and low energy neutrino astrophysics ( lena ) , will allow a precise determination of such solar neutrino fluxes , leading to the establishment of important constraints on the composition of heavy elements in the sun s core  @xcite .",
    "in particular , as pointed out by  @xcite , the future upgrade of borexino and sno will be able to put some constraints on the abundance of carbon and nitrogen present in the sun s core .",
    "furthermore , as stressed by these authors , preliminary simulations done by  @xcite of the sno+ detector  @xcite suggest that after three years of operation the cno neutrino rate should be known with an accuracy of 10% ( cf .",
    "figs  [ fig:4 ] and  [ fig:5 ] ) .",
    "moreover , on the current version of the lena project the promoters expect to improve the signal of cno and pep neutrino fluxes relatively to the background `` noise '' generated by the @xmath216 beta decays .",
    "the @xmath216 beta decays are known to be the main problem in these types of experiments .",
    "the @xmath216 background rate will be 1:8 .",
    "furthermore , monte carlo simulations done for the lena detector  @xcite suggest that it will be possible to find minute temporal variations ( with the period window : @xmath217 ) for the amplitude of @xmath4be neutrino flux .",
    "if cno neutrino flux measurements are obtained with the expected precision , we will be able to precisely determine the abundances of carbon , nitrogen and oxygen in the solar radiative region , including the deepest layers of the core . in agreement with the results obtained in this work , if the abundances of carbon , nitrogen and oxygen in the solar core are 30% above the current values , then the @xmath0n , @xmath1o and @xmath2f neutrino fluxes should be 25%-80% above the predicted values of the current ssm .    on that account ,",
    "as shown in this work , with the large improvements expected in the accuracy of future neutrino flux measurements and given the high sensitivity of neutrino fluxes to the metallicity of the sun s interior , it should be possible to put very strong constraints on the chemical composition of the sun .",

    "<S> recent observations of solar twin stars with planetary systems like the sun , have uncovered that these present a peculiar surface chemical composition . </S>",

    "<S> this suggests that twin stars have a radiative interior that is richer in heavy elements than their envelopes . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the current standard solar model does not fully agree with the helioseismology data and solar neutrino flux measurements . in this work , we find that this agreement can improve if the sun has mass loss during the pre - main sequence , as was previously shown by other groups . despite this better agreement , the internal composition of the sun is still uncertain , especially for elements heavier than helium . with the goal of inferring the chemical abundance of the solar interior </S>",
    "<S> , we tested several chemical compositions . </S>",
    "<S> we found that heavy element abundances influence the sound speed and solar neutrinos equally . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the carbon - nitrogen - oxygen ( cno;@xmath0n , @xmath1o and @xmath2f ) neutrino fluxes are the most affected ; this is due to the fact that contrarily to proton - proton ( pp , pep , @xmath3b and @xmath4be ) neutrino fluxes , the cno neutrino fluxes are less dependent on the total luminosity of the star . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , if the central solar metallicity increases by 30% , as hinted by the solar twin stars observations , this new solar model predicts that @xmath0n , @xmath1o and @xmath2f neutrino fluxes increase by 25%-80% relative to the standard solar model . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we highlight that the next generation of solar neutrino experiments will not only put constraints on the abundances of carbon , oxygen and nitrogen , but will also give some information about their radial distribution .    </S>",
