    "the cosmic dark age ended when the first gas clouds condensed out of the primordial fluctuations at redshifts @xmath7 ( peacock 1992 ; rees 1996 ) .",
    "these condensations are likely the sites where the first clusters of stars and the first quasar black holes appeared , giving birth to the first `` mini  galaxies '' or `` mini  quasars '' in the universe . despite the lack of observational data ,",
    "this epoch has become a subject of intense theoretical study in the past few years .",
    "the recent interest can be attributed to forthcoming instruments : _ ngst _ could directly image sub  galactic objects at @xmath0 in the infrared , while microwave satellites such as map or planck could measure signatures from the reionization of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "currently , bright quasars are detected out to @xmath8 ( fan et al .",
    "although the abundance of optically and radio bright quasars declines at @xmath9 ( schmidt et al . 1995 ; shaver et al . 1996 ) , a recent determination of the x  ray luminosity function ( lf ) of quasars from rosat data ( miyaji et al .",
    "1998a ) has not confirmed this decline . in this contribution , we point out that future x  ray observations might provide yet another probe of the first quasars and the end of the dark age at @xmath10 , and that x  ray data might be uniquely useful in distinguishing quasars from stellar systems .",
    "in popular cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmologies , the first baryonic objects appear near the jeans mass ( @xmath11 ) at redshifts as high as @xmath12 ( haiman & loeb 1999b , and references therein ) . at any redshift ,",
    "the mass function of collapsed dark halos is given to within a factor of two by the press ",
    "schechter formalism .",
    "following collapse , the gas in the first baryonic condensations is virialized by a strong shock ( bertschinger 1985 ) .",
    "provided it is able to cool on a timescale shorter than the hubble time , the shock  heated gas continues to contract .",
    "depending on the details of the cooling and angular momentum transport , the gas then either fragments into stars , or forms a central black hole exhibiting quasar activity .",
    "although the actual fragmentation process is likely to be rather complex , the average fraction @xmath13 of the collapsed gas converted into stars can be calibrated empirically so as to reproduce the average metallicity observed in the universe at @xmath14",
    ". the observed ratio , inferred from civ absorption lines in  forest clouds , is between @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the solar value ( songaila 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "if the carbon produced in the early mini  galaxies is uniformly mixed with the rest of the baryons in the universe , this implies @xmath17220% for a scalo stellar mass function",
    ".    an even smaller fraction of the cooling gas might condense at the center of the potential well of each cloud and form a massive black hole , exhibiting quasar activity . in the simplest scenario ,",
    "the peak luminosity of each black hole is proportional to its mass , and the light ",
    "curve , expressed in eddington units , is a universal function of time . indeed , for a sufficiently high fueling rate , quasars are likely to shine at their maximum possible luminosity , which is some constant fraction of the eddington limit , for a time which is dictated by their final mass and radiative efficiency . here",
    "we assume that the black hole mass fraction @xmath18 obeys a log - gaussian probability distribution , @xmath19 $ ] , with @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( haiman & loeb 1999b ) .",
    "these values roughly reflect the distribution of black hole to bulge mass ratios found in a sample of 36 local galaxies ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) for a baryonic mass fraction of @xmath22 .",
    "we further postulate that each black hole emits a time ",
    "dependent bolometric luminosity in proportion to its mass , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the eddington luminosity , @xmath25 is the time elapsed since the formation of the black hole , and @xmath26 yr is the characteristic quasar lifetime .",
    "finally , we assume that the shape of the emitted spectrum follows the mean spectrum of known quasars ( elvis et al .",
    "1994 ) up to a photon energy of 10 kev .",
    "we extrapolate the spectrum up to @xmath27 kev , assuming a spectral slope of @xmath28=0 ( or a photon index of -1 ) . for reference ,",
    "figure  1 shows the adopted spectrum of quasars , assuming a black hole mass @xmath29 , placed at two different redshifts , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and processed through the igm , and assumed that reionization occurred at @xmath32 and that at higher redshifts the igm was homogeneous and fully neutral . at lower redshifts , @xmath33",
    ", we included the hydrogen opacity of the ly@xmath28 forest given by madau ( 1995 ) , extrapolating his fitting formulae for the evolution of the number density of absorbers beyond @xmath34 when necessary .",
    "as figure  1 shows , the minimum black hole mass detectable by the @xmath1 flux limit of _ cxo _ ( see below ) is @xmath35 at @xmath36 and @xmath37 at @xmath34 . in our model ,",
    "the corresponding halo masses are @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "although such massive halos are rare , their abundance is detectable in wide - field surveys .",
    "the next generation space telescope ( _ ngst _ ) will be able to detect the early population of mini  galaxies and mini  quasars .",
    "_ ngst _ is scheduled for launch in 2008 , and is expected to reach an imaging sensitivity of @xmath4 njy ( s / n=10 at spectral resolution @xmath40 ) for extended sources after several hours of integration in the wavelength range of 13.5@xmath41 m .",
    "figure  2 shows the predicted number counts in the mini  galaxy and mini  quasar models described above , in a @xmath42cdm cosmology with ( @xmath43)=(0.35 , 0.65 , 0.04 , 0.65 , 0.87 , 0.96 ) , normalized to a @xmath44 field of view .",
    "this figure shows separately the number per logarithmic flux interval of all objects with redshifts @xmath45 ( thin lines ) , and @xmath46 ( thick lines ) .",
    "as the figure shows , _ ngst _ will be able to probe about @xmath47 quasars at @xmath46 , and @xmath48 quasars at @xmath45 per field of view .",
    "the bright  end tail of the number counts approximately follows a power law , with @xmath49 .",
    "the dashed lines show the corresponding number counts of mini  galaxies , assuming that each halo undergoes a starburst that converts a fraction of 2% ( long  dashed ) or 20% ( short  dashed ) of the gas into stars .",
    "these lines indicate that _ ngst _ would detect @xmath50 mini  galaxies at @xmath46 per field of view , and @xmath51 mini  galaxies at @xmath45 . unlike quasars",
    ", galaxies could in principle be resolved if they extend over a scale comparable to the virial radius of their dark matter halos ( haiman & loeb 1997 ; barkana and loeb 1999 ) .",
    "the supernovae and @xmath52-ray bursts in these galaxies might outshine their hosts and may also be directly observable ( miralda - escud & rees 1997 ) .",
    "finally , we note that recent data in the @xmath53 and @xmath54 infrared bands from deep nicmos observations of the hdf ( thompson et al . 1999 ) could already be useful to constrain mini ",
    "quasar and mini  galaxy models .",
    "although the infrared wavelengths are the best suited to detect the redshifted uv  emission from objects at @xmath10 , present data in the optical already yields a constraint on quasar models of the type described above .",
    "the properties of faint _ extended _ sources found in the hdf ( madau et al .",
    "1996 ) agree with detailed semi  analytic models of galaxy formation ( baugh et al .",
    "1998 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the hdf has revealed only a handful of faint _ unresolved _ sources , but none with the colors expected for high redshift quasars ( conti et al .",
    "the simplest mini ",
    "quasar model described above predicts the existence of @xmath55 b  band `` dropouts '' in the hdf , inconsistently with the lack of detection of such dropouts up to the @xmath56 completeness limit at @xmath57 in the hdf . to reconcile the models with the data ,",
    "a mechanism is needed for suppressing the formation of quasars in halos with circular velocities @xmath58 ( see figure  3 for the counts ) .",
    "this suppression naturally arises due to the photo - ionization heating of the intergalactic gas by the uv background after reionization ( thoul & weinberg 1996 ; navarro & steinmetz 1997 ) .",
    "alternative effects could help reduce the quasar number counts , such as a change in the background cosmology , a shift in the `` big blue bump '' component of the quasar spectrum to higher energies due to the lower black hole masses in mini ",
    "quasars , or a nonlinear black hole to halo mass relation ; however , these effects are too small to account for the lack of detections in the hdf ( haiman , madau & loeb 1999 ) .",
    "quasars can be best distinguished from star forming galaxies at high redshifts by their x - ray emission .",
    "detections of high-@xmath59 quasars would therefore be highly valuable : detections , or upper limits would help in answering the important question of whether the igm at @xmath60 was reionized by stars or quasars , by yielding constraints on the ionizing photon rate from high@xmath59 quasars .",
    "the simple quasar  model described above was constructed to accurately reproduce the evolution of the optical luminosity function in the b  band ( pei 1995 ) at redshifts @xmath61 ( haiman & loeb 1998 ) .",
    "however , it yields good agreement with the data on the x  ray lf , as demonstrated in haiman & loeb ( 1999c ) , and shown here in figure  4 .",
    "we regard this model as a minimal toy model which successfully reproduces the existing data , and use a straightforward extrapolation of this model to predict the x  ray number counts . in figure  5 , we show the predicted counts in the 0.46kev energy band of the ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) of _ cxo_. note that these curves are insensitive to our extrapolation of the template spectrum beyond 10 kev .",
    "the figure is normalized to the @xmath62 field of view of the imaging chips .",
    "the solid curves show that of order a hundred quasars with @xmath45 are expected per field at the _ cxo _ sensitivity of @xmath63 for a 5@xmath64 detection of a point source .",
    "note that _ cxo _ s arcsecond resolution will ease the separation of these point sources from background noise .",
    "the abundance of quasars at higher redshifts declines rapidly ; however , a few objects per field are still detectable at @xmath65 .",
    "the dashed lines show the results for a minimum circular velocity of the host halos of @xmath66 , and imply that the model predictions for the _ cxo _ satellite are not sensitive to such a change in the host velocity cutoff .",
    "this is because the halos shining at the _ cxo _ detection threshold are relatively massive , @xmath67 , and possess a circular velocity above the cutoff . in principle , the number of predicted sources would be lower if we had assumed a steeper spectral slope .",
    "for example , as figure  6 shows below , our model falls short of predicting the hard x  ray background , by about an order of magnitude at 10 kev .",
    "the difference could be explained by a change in our template spectrum to include a population of quasars with hard , but highly absorbed spectra ( caused by the denser , and more gas rich hosts at high redshift ) .",
    "we note , however , that the agreement between the lf predicted by our model at @xmath68 and that inferred from rosat observations would be upset by such a change , and require a modification of the model that would in turn tend to counter - balance the decrease in the predicted counts .",
    "existing estimates of the x  ray background ( xrb ) provide another useful check on our quasar model .",
    "figure  6 shows the predicted spectrum of the xrb in our model at @xmath69 ( solid lines ) .",
    "the unresolved background flux is shown , obtained by summing the emission of all quasars whose individual observed flux at @xmath69 is below the rosat pspc detection limit for discrete sources of @xmath70 ( hasinger & zamorani 1997 ) .",
    "the short dashed lines show the predicted fluxes assuming a steeper spectral slope beyond 10 kev ( @xmath71 , or a photon index of -1.5 ) .",
    "the long dashed line shows the 25% unresolved fraction of the soft xrb observed with rosat ( miyaji et al . 1998b ; fabian & barcons 1992 ) .",
    "this fraction represents the observational upper limit on the component of the soft xrb that could in principle arise from high - redshift quasars .",
    "as the figure shows , our quasar model predicts an unresolved flux just below this limit in the 0.5 - 3 kev range .",
    "the model also predicts that most ( @xmath72 ) of this yet unresolved fraction arises from quasars beyond @xmath34 .",
    "the power spectrum of the unresolved background therefore might carry information on quasars at @xmath45 , and be useful in constraining the models ( haiman & hui 1999 , in preparation ) .",
    "the correlations in the background have recently been measured by soltan et al .",
    "( 1999 , see also this proceedings ) .",
    "we have demonstrated that state  of  the  art x - ray observations could yield more stringent constraints on quasar models than currently available from the hubble deep field ( haiman , madau , & loeb 1999 ) .",
    "the x  ray data might provide the first probe of the earliest quasars , complementing subsequent infrared and microwave observations .",
    "more specifically , we have found that forthcoming x  ray observations with the _ cxo _ satellite might detect of order a hundred quasars per field of view in the redshift interval @xmath73 .",
    "our numerical estimates are based on the simplest toy model for quasar formation in a hierarchical cdm cosmology , that satisfies all the current observational constraints on the optical and x - ray luminosity functions of quasars .",
    "although a more detailed analysis is needed in order to assess the modeling uncertainties in our predictions , the importance of related observational programs with _",
    "cxo _ is evident already from the present analysis .",
    "other future instruments , such as the hrc or the acis - s cameras on _ cxo _ , or the epic camera on _ xmm _ , which has a collective area 310 times larger than that of _ cxo _ , will also be useful in searching for high  redshift quasars",
    ".    the relation between the black hole and halo masses may be more complicated than linear . with the introduction of additional free parameters , a non  linear ( mass and redshift dependent ) relation between the black  hole and halo masses",
    "can also lead to acceptable fits ( haehnelt et al . 1998 ) of the observed quasar lf near @xmath74 .",
    "such fits , when extrapolated to higher redshift , can result in different predictions for the abundance of high  redshift quasars . from the point of view of selecting between these alternative models ,",
    "even a non  detection by cxo would be invaluable .",
    "it is hoped further that either observations of the clustering properties of @xmath75 quasars in the sloan digital sky survey , or a measurement of the power spectrum of the soft x  ray background , would break model degeneracies ( haiman & hui 1999 , in preparation ) .",
    "quasars emit a broad spectrum which extends into the uv and includes strong emission lines , such as ly@xmath28 . for quasars near the _ cxo _ detection threshold , the fluxes at @xmath76",
    "m are expected to be relatively high , @xmath77@xmath78jy .",
    "therefore , infrared spectroscopy of x  ray selected quasars with the space infrared telescope facility _ ( sirtf ) _ or _ ngst _ can identify the redshifts of the faint x ",
    "ray point - like sources detected by the _ cxo _ satellite .",
    "such an approach could prove to be a particularly useful approach for unraveling the reionization history of the intergalactic medium at @xmath3 . at present ,",
    "the best constraints on hierarchical models of the formation and evolution of quasars originate from the hubble deep field .",
    "however , _ hst _",
    "observations are only sensitive to a limiting magnitude of @xmath79 , and can not probe the earliest quasars , beyond @xmath80 . the combination of x - ray data from the _ cxo _ satellite and infrared spectroscopy from _ sirtf _ and _ ngst _ could potentially resolve one of the most important open questions about the thermal history of the universe , namely whether the intergalactic medium was reionized by stars or by accreting black holes .",
