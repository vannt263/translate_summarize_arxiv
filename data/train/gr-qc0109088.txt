    "massive compact binary systems consisting of neutron stars ( up to a distance of 20 mpc ) or black - holes ( up to 200 mpc ) ranging in masses from @xmath0 0.5 @xmath1 to @xmath0 10.0 @xmath1 are one of the most promising sources for large scale laser interferometric detectors for gravitational waves ( gw ) .",
    "few minutes before the final merger , the gw frequency of such sources will lie within the bandwidth of the detectors .",
    "the expected gw waveform of these sources is known adequately to allow pattern matching techniques like matched filtering to be used for signal extraction .",
    "however matched filtering is computationally quite expensive , since hundreds of thousands of templates must be used to search the multidimensional parameter space .",
    "the hierarchical search algorithm of mohanty and dhurandhar @xcite which employed a hierarchy of templates over the mass parameters achieved a significant improvement in cutting down the cost by a factor between 25 and 30 . in this paper",
    "we explore the possibility of extending the hierarchical paradigm to an extra dimension - the time of arrival of the signal .",
    "this is achieved by using the idea of decimating the signal in time ( proposed before in @xcite but not worked out in detail ) .",
    "this reduces the computational cost by about a factor of 100 over the 1-step search described in section [ section_onestep ] for a single detector with ligo i noise power spectral density .",
    "in the stationary phase approximation , the fourier transform @xmath2 of the spin - less restricted second order post - newtonian ( 2pn ) waveform up to a constant factor @xmath3 , is given by @xmath4,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the total mass of the binary system , @xmath6 is the ratio of the reduced mass to the total mass , @xmath7 is the initial phase at some fiducial frequency @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the frequency .",
    "@xmath3 depends on @xcite the masses , the distance to the binaries and @xmath8 .",
    "the function @xmath10 describes the phase evolution of the inspiral waveform and is given by , @xmath11 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the kinematical parameters @xmath12 do not determine the shape of the waveform and can be treated very simply in the matched filtering procedure @xcite . in",
    "what follows , the parameter space will explicitly refer to the space of dynamical parameters that determine the phase , and thus the shape of the waveform . for the 2pn case , it is the two dimensional space described by @xmath13 . in order to facilitate the analysis one chooses a new set of parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 in which the metric defined over the parameter space @xcite is approximately constant .",
    "they are related to @xmath5 and @xmath6 by @xmath16 in these new co - ordinates the parameter space is wedge shaped as shown in the left panel of figure [ figarea ] .",

    "shown on the right panel is a schematic of discrete template placement using hexagonal closed packing ( _ hcp _ ) .",

    "the fiducial frequency is set to @xmath18 hz for this figure and the area is @xmath19 . shown on the right panel",
    "is a schematic of discrete template placement using hexagonal closed packing ( _ hcp _ ) .",
    "the spacing between neighboring templates is very small compared to the total area , and thus we can extend the method to the whole parameter space.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    a straight forward implementation of matched filtering involves constructing a discrete lattice of normalized templates over the parameter space and computing correlations with the detector output .",
    "the bandwidth over which the correlations are computed in the frequency space , is taken from the seismic lower cutoff frequency @xmath20 to a upper cutoff frequency @xmath21 .",
    "for the ligo laboratory accepted noise psd @xcite , we set @xmath22 and @xmath23 . the maximum of the correlation output is compared with the threshold @xmath24 ( we put the subscript ` 2 ' because @xmath24 will be used as the second stage threshold in the hierarchical scheme described later ) which depends on a pre - decided false alarm rate usually set at one per year .",
    "the false alarm rate we assume here is for one detector only .",
    "if the data is sampled at @xmath25 , the noise assumed to be a gaussian stationary process and the number of templates @xmath26 then the threshold @xmath27 .",
    "detection is announced if the maximum correlation exceeds this threshold .",
    "the degree of discretization of templates is governed by a maximum mismatch between the signal and the filter , which is taken to be @xmath28 ( corresponding to a maximum loss of event rate of @xmath29 ) .",
    "the mismatch in terms of the parameters @xmath30 is encoded in the ambiguity function @xmath31 .",
    "actually @xmath32 also depends weakly on the position @xmath33 , but we ignore its effect in the present analysis .",
    "we use the most efficient hexagonal closed packing ( _ hcp _ ) tiling for placing the templates as shown in figure [ figarea ] ( right panel ) , with a packing fraction of @xmath34 .",
    "this leads to 17000 templates for ligo i noise psd and for a mass range of @xmath35 .",
    "sampling at @xmath25 with a data train @xmath36 sec long to allow for @xmath37 padding , the number of points in the data train is @xmath38 . the online speed required to cover the cost of ffts amounts to 2.54 g - flops using this 1-step implementation of matched filtering .",
    "the required speed rises to about 15 g - flops if the minimum mass of the mass range is reduced to @xmath39 and to about 150 g - flop when the minimum mass is @xmath40 .",
    "the hierarchical scheme as given in @xcite involves parsing the data through two template banks instead of one .",
    "the basic idea is to use a coarse bank of templates in the first stage along with a lower threshold .",
    "this allows the parameter space to be scanned with less number of templates .",
    "however the lower threshold leads to a large number of false alarms which must be then followed up with a fine bank ( maximum mismatch @xmath28 ) search .",
    "the above idea can be extended to include the time of arrival of the signal - by cutting off the chirp at a lower frequency @xmath41 and re - sampling it at a lower nyquist rate in the trigger phase of a two step implementation of matched filtering .",
    "this is possible because the inspiral signal contains most of the signal power at lower frequencies ( the power spectrum scales as @xmath42 ) and thus we do not lose much of the snr .",
    "the fractional snr that can be recovered in this case is given by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 in the left panel of figure [ figsnr ] we have plotted the relative snr as a function of the cutoff frequency .",
    "as can be clearly seen , a significant fraction of the signal power can be recovered from a relatively small value of @xmath41 .",
    "specifically , for @xmath45 , almost @xmath46 of the snr can be recovered .",
    "since not too much of the snr is lost , the hierarchy over the masses @xcite is not compromised too severely .",
    "the most obvious advantage of lowering the nyquist rate in the first stage is that we have fewer points to contend with in computing the ffts ( the cost of ffts scale as @xmath47 ) , leading to reduction in cost .",
    "for example , @xmath48 reduces the sampling rate to a quarter , reducing the cost of ffts by almost the same factor .",
    "secondly , the ambiguity function becomes wider thereby reducing the number of templates used in the first stage and reducing the cost .",
    "the first stage threshold @xmath49 is set by striking a balance between the two opposing effects ; ( i ) @xmath49 must be low enough to allow coarsest possible placement of trigger stage templates so that the first stage computational cost is minimized , ( ii ) @xmath49 must be high enough to reduce the number of false crossings , so that the second stage cost is reduced .    .",
    "the snr is normalized to 1 for @xmath50 .",
    "the right panel shows the @xmath51 contours along with the largest inscribed rectangle used in the trigger stage of ehs algorithm for @xmath52 .",
    "the ellipse inside the rectangle is that used by 1-step search to tile the space and is given for comparison of the areas.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] .",
    "the snr is normalized to 1 for @xmath50 .",
    "the right panel shows the @xmath51 contours along with the largest inscribed rectangle used in the trigger stage of ehs algorithm for @xmath52 .",
    "the ellipse inside the rectangle is that used by 1-step search to tile the space and is given for comparison of the areas.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    by choosing @xmath49 optimally , the total computational cost arising from both the stages is minimized .",
    "we consider data trains of length @xmath53 which accommodate chirps of maximum length @xmath54 with sufficient padding corresponding to minimum mass limit of @xmath55 .",
    "we consider first and second stage sampling frequencies of @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "the cutoff frequency in the first stage is set at @xmath58 .",
    "thus the data points to be processed are @xmath59 and @xmath38 for the coarse and fine banks respectively .",
    "the second stage threshold is set at @xmath27 as before ( see section [ section_onestep ] ) for a false alarm rate of one per year .",
    "the signals of minimal strength that can be observed , assuming a minimum detection probability of @xmath60 and @xmath28 mismatch between templates turns out to be @xmath61 . the first stage @xmath62 for the above mentioned cutoff can be calculated to be @xmath63 of 9.17 which is 8.44 .",
    "it is found that the total cost is minimized for @xmath64 .",
    "again , assuming a minimum detection probability of @xmath60 in the first stage itself , the ambiguity function can be allowed to drop to @xmath65 which is about @xmath66 of its maximum value .",
    "this large drop allows for very big tiles as shown in the right panel of figure [ figsnr ]",
    ". however , the awkward shape of these tiles makes tiling the parameter space a difficult proposition .",
    "we surmount this problem by cutting out the largest inscribed rectangle as shown in the same figure which has an area of @xmath67 .",
    "this is @xmath68 times larger than the area of second stage tiles .",
    "combining the first and second stage costs , the required online speed is then estimated at 19.54 m - flops , giving a gain factor of about 130 over the one step search .",
    "we have shown that a three dimensional hierarchical search for gravitational waves emitted by inspiraling compact binaries is a highly promising proposition .",
    "we have obtained a computational cost reduction factor of about 130 for an ideal search , when the parameter space can be optimally tiled by the first stage template rectangles . however due to _ boundary effects _ this factor can be drastically reduced . as can be seen in figure [ figlay ] , the parameter space tapers towards the low mass end where the tiling becomes inefficient .",
    "most of the tiles go ` out ' of the deemed parameter space .",
    "it is estimated that this can cut down the above mentioned gain factor by about @xmath69 .",
    "these effects become less pronounced when the lower mass limit of the mass range is reduced .",
    "we expect to recover the gain factor to about 100 , if the lower mass limit is reduced to less than @xmath70 .",
    "the second important effect , affecting the gain factor , will come from the rotation of the first and second stage tiles and also the differential rotation between them .",
    "these effects have still to be taken into account and will be the thrust of our future investigations .",
    "however , we do not expect this effect to alter the gain factor very much .",
