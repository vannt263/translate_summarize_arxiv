    "it is known that one of the main unsolved problems in high energy physics is a quantitative description ( from first principles ) of confinement in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "albeit phenomenological models still represent a key tool for understanding confinement physics . in this context",
    "we recall the phenomenon of condensation , where in the scenario of dual superconductivity , it is conjectured that the qcd vacuum behaves as a dual - type ii superconductor . more explicitly , due to the condensation of magnetic monopoles , the chromo - electric field acting between @xmath0 pair is squeezed into strings , and",
    "the non vanishing string tension represents the proportionality constant in the linear potential .",
    "incidentally , lattice calculations have confirmed this picture by showing the formation of tubes of gluonic fields connecting colored charges @xcite .    it is also known that considerable attention has been paid to the investigation of extensions of the standard model ( sm ) , such as lorentz invariance violation and fundamental length @xcite , because the sm does not include a quantum theory of gravitation . in this respect we recall that , in the last few years , the emphasis of quantum gravity has been on effective models incorporating a minimal length scale .",
    "in fact , there are several approaches on how to incorporate a minimal length scale in a quantum field theory , leading to a model of quantum space - time @xcite . of these ,",
    "non - commutative quantum field theories have motivated a great interest @xcite .",
    "notice that this non - commutative geometry is an intrinsic property of space - time .",
    "in addition , we also recall that most of the known results in the non - commutative approach have been achieved using a moyal star - product .",
    "nevertheless , in recent times , a new formulation of non - commutative quantum field theory in the presence of a minimal length has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "afterwards , this approach was further developed by the introduction of a new multiplication rule , which is known as voros star - product .",
    "notwithstanding , physics turns out be independent from the choice of the type of product @xcite .",
    "consequently , with the introduction of non - commutativity by means of a minimal length , the theory becomes ultraviolet finite and the cutoff is provided by the non - commutative parameter @xmath1 .    in this perspective",
    "the present work is an extension of our previous study @xcite .",
    "thus , the basic ideas underlying the analysis of this paper are derived from our earlier paper @xcite .",
    "specifically , in this work we will focus attention on the impact of a minimal length on a physical observable for pure yang - mills theory in @xmath2d .",
    "it is worthy noting here that yang - mills theories in @xmath2d are very relevant for a reliable comparison between results coming from continuum and lattice calculations @xcite .",
    "also , @xmath2d theories have been raising a great deal of interest in connection with branes activity , for example : issues like self - duality @xcite , and new possibilities for supersymmetry breaking as induced by @xmath3-branes @xcite . yet",
    ", @xmath2d theories may be adopted to describe the high - temperature limit of models in @xmath4d @xcite .",
    "in fact , such theories are of interest to probe low - dimensional condensed matter systems , such as spin or pairing fluctuations by means of effective gauge theories , for which @xmath2d theories are a very good approximation @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to accomplish the purpose of studying the impact of a minimal length for yang - mills theory in @xmath2d , we shall work out the static potential for the case under consideration .",
    "as we shall see , the presence of a minimal length leads to an ultraviolet finite static potential , which contains a regularized logarithmic function and a linear confining potential .",
    "accordingly , our study offers a straightforward calculation in which some features of three - dimensional non - abelian gauge theories become more transparent .",
    "we shall now discuss the interaction energy for yang - mills theory in the presence of a minimal length .",
    "we start then with the three - dimensional space - time lagrangian : @xmath5 here @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with @xmath8 the structure constants of the gauge group .",
    "as we have indicated in @xcite , our analysis is based in perturbation theory along the lines of refs .",
    "@xcite . to do this , we will work out the vacuum expectation value of the energy operator @xmath9 @xmath10 at lowest order in @xmath11 , in the coulomb gauge .",
    "the canonical hamiltonian can be worked as usual and is given by @xmath12 where the color - electric field @xmath13 has been separated into transverse and longitudinal parts : @xmath14 .",
    "next , by making use of gauss s law @xmath15 we get @xmath16    following our earlier procedure , the corresponding formulation of this theory in the presence of a minimal length is by means of a smeared source @xcite .",
    "thus , we will take the sources as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the color charges of a heavy antiquark @xmath22 and a quark @xmath23 in a normalized color singlet state @xmath24 .",
    "hence @xmath25 , where the anti - hermitian generators @xmath26 are in the fundamental representation of su(n ) .    by proceeding in the same way as in @xcite",
    ", we obtain the expectation value of the energy operator @xmath9 to order @xmath27 and @xmath28 : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31    the @xmath32 term is exactly the one obtained in @xcite . consequently , eq . ( @xmath33 ) takes the form @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 is an infrared regulator .",
    "again , as in our previous analysis @xcite , unexpected features are found .",
    "interestingly , it is observed that unlike the coulomb potential which is singular at the origin , @xmath32 is finite there : @xmath37 .",
    "we now turn our attention to the @xmath38 term , which is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 in passing we recall that to obtain eq.([3dym45 ] ) we have expressed the @xmath41-fields in terms of a normal mode expansion : @xmath42 $ ] , along with @xmath43 = \\delta ^{ab } \\delta ^{\\lambda \\sigma } \\delta ^{\\left ( 3 \\right ) } \\left ( { { \\bf p } - { \\bf l } } \\right)$ ] and @xmath44 . here",
    "we would mention that the correction term of order @xmath28 represents an anti - screening effect .",
    "incidentally , it is of interest to notice that precisely this term is in the origin of asymptotic freedom in the @xmath4d case , which is due to the instantaneous coulomb interaction of the quarks .",
    "when the integral ( [ 3dym50 ] ) is performed , one gets @xmath45 expression ( [ 3dym45 ] ) then becomes @xmath46    we now proceed to calculate the integral ( [ 3dym60 ] ) .",
    "following our earlier procedure @xcite , equation ( [ 3dym60 ] ) is further rewritten as @xmath47 then , the @xmath48 term takes the form @xmath49 hence , at leading order in @xmath1 , equation ( [ 3dym70 ] ) reduces to @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the lower incomplete gamma function defined by the following integral representation @xmath52    accordingly , the @xmath38 term reads @xmath53    now we focus on the @xmath54 screening contribution to the potential , which is due to the exchange of transverse gluons . from our above perturbation theory , we find that @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 in passing we recall that , @xmath57 , is the matrix element in the basis of states in which the non perturbated hamiltonian is diagonal .",
    "next , it should be noted that the intermediate state @xmath58 must contains a pair of transverse gluons , since the terms @xmath59 must create and destroy dynamical gluon pairs .",
    "we can , therefore , write two gluon states as @xmath60 by substituting eq .",
    "( [ 3dym90b ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ 3dym90 ] ) and following our earlier procedure , the @xmath61 term assumes the form @xmath62 where @xmath63    integrating now over @xmath64 , one then obtains @xmath65 . as a consequence ,",
    "the @xmath55 term becomes @xmath66 it is straightforward to see that this integral is exactly the one obtained in expression ( [ 3dym60 ] ) .    by putting together eqs .",
    "( [ 3dym40 ] ) , ( [ 3dym60 ] ) and ( [ 3dym105 ] ) , we evaluate the interquark potential in position space .",
    "we thus finally obtain @xmath67 which is ultraviolet finite ( fig .",
    "1 ) . an immediate consequence of this is that for @xmath68 one obtains the known interquark potential at order @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "note that in figure @xmath69 , for illustrative purposes , we have defined @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    ", as a function of @xmath74 .",
    "to conclude , let us put our work in its proper perspective .",
    "as already anticipated , this work is a sequel to @xcite , where we have considered a three - dimensional extension of the recently @xmath4d calculation in the presence of a minimal length . to do this",
    ", we have exploited a correct identification of field degrees with observable quantities .",
    "once the identification has been made , the computation of the potential is achieved by means of gauss law . interestingly enough",
    ", it was found that the static potential profile is ultraviolet finite , which contains a regularized logarithmic function and a linear potential leading to confinement of static sources .",
    "finally , we note that our results agree for the @xmath68 case with the calculation shown in @xcite .",
    "also very recently , in the context of the georgi - glashow model it has been shown that there is confinement at distances much larger than the screening length @xcite . since our calculation",
    "has shown that there is confinement in three - dimensional yang - mills , it seems a challenging work to extend the above analysis to the georgi - glashow model .",
    "we expect to report on progress along this lines soon .",
