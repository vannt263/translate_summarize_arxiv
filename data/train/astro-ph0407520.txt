    "the hubble deep field ( hdf ) north ( williams et al . 1996 ) and south ( casertano et al . 2000 ) are among the deepest views of the universe ever obtained .",

    "morphology plays a fundamental role in understanding galaxy evolution as each galaxy type could evolve differently with @xmath0 . to facilitate the comparison with the theoretical predictions ,",
    "galaxy evolution studies must be rooted in a quantitative basis .",
    "in addition , quantitative morphology enables one to study any possible evolution of the galaxy structural parameters such as luminosity , size , etc . , and their associated scaling relations with regards to the values measured in nearby samples .    in the hierarchical galaxy formation framework",
    ", both disc and elliptical galaxy properties are expected to evolve at high  z . in this paradigm , it is generally assumed that much of a galaxy s star formation takes place in a galactic disc which formed by gas infall into dark matter halos ( white & frenk 1991 ; kauffmann et al . 1999 ; somerville & primack 1999 ) . according to mo , mau & white ( 1998 ) the size of the disc galaxies , at a fixed halo circular velocity ,",
    "must decrease with redshift as @xmath17h@xmath13(z ) where h(z ) is the hubble parameter at redshift z. on the other hand , e / s0 galaxies are expected to form via repeated merging ( toomre & toomre 1972 ) .",
    "the formation epoch of the e / s0 galaxies is sensitive to the assumed values of cosmological parameters , occurring at higher redshift at lower @xmath14 ( kauffmann & charlot 1998 ) .",
    "there are alternative theories of galaxy formation .",
    "one is that all galaxies , including e / s0 , formed very early via monolithic collapse of the gas at high redshift ( eggen , lynden  bell & sandage 1962 ; larson 1975 ; chiosi & carraro 2002 ) . according to this theory e / s0 properties will be already in place at high  z . for disc galaxies ,",
    "some `` backward '' approaches have been tried .",
    "these approaches use the detailed studies of the profiles of the milky way and other nearby galaxies to propose radially dependent models of star formation that could be used to make predictions about high  z disc evolution ( cayn , silk & charlot 1996 ; bouwens , cayn & silk 1997 ; roche et al .",
    "however , both the hierarchical and `` backward '' models predict relatively similar amounts of evolution in disc global properties ( size , luminosity , etc . ) to @xmath0@xmath41 ( bouwens & silk 2002 ) .",

    "quantitative morphological analysis can be conducted using non  model based techniques like the concentration and asymmetry of the galactic light ( abraham et al .",
    "1996 ) . however , these techniques have the disadvantage that they do not allow the study of the different structural components of the galaxy separately , and particularly , the evolutionary analysis of the well known local scale relation can not be addressed .    improving upon previous analyses ,",

    "s , a systematic quantitative morphological analysis of this field have been not yet conducted and it is of great interest to compare the galaxy properties between these two twin fields .    in this paper",
    "we present the galaxy structural parameters of both hdf fields and compare our results to previous classification schemes . to assess the degree of evolution , if any , the early and late  type luminosity  size relations are compared with those observed in the nearby universe provided by large local surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( york et al .",

    "we detail our object morphological classification and in section 5 we analyse the accuracy of our analysis by comparing our results with simulations and previous work . section 6 deals with the issue of selection effects . the luminosity  size relations of early and late  type galaxies are presented in section 7 .",

    "the high sampling of these images avoids the undersampling problems affecting other hubble space telescope ( hst ) images .    in order to assure a reliable estimation of the structural parameters ( see the simulations section ) we have selected all the i@xmath2(ab)@xmath124.5 galaxies with z@xmath11 .",

    "this `` color '' magnitude is finally transformed to a total magnitude using the total magnitude in the k@xmath24band .",
    "the total k@xmath24band magnitude is based on a kron  like aperture ( sex auto ) derived from the k@xmath24detection image .",

    "the number identifications of the objects correspond to the same numbers used in the photometric redshift catalogs .",
    "our morphological analysis is based on the decomposition of the surface brightness ( sb ) profile into a bulge and a disc component .",
    "the bulge component is modeled by a srsic ( 1968 ) profile of the form : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the bulge central intensity , @xmath28 is the bulge semi  major effective radius and @xmath21 the srsic shape parameter .",

    "the srsic model contains the classical de vaucouleurs profile when @xmath21 is equal to 4 .",

    "the set of free parameters is completed with the ellipticities of the bulge @xmath38 and the disc @xmath39 .",

    "the main points of the routine are as follows .",
    "the final sb distributions resulting from the convolution between the point spread function ( psf ) and our 2d srsic model sb distribution are dependent on the intrinsic ellipticity of the original source . however , to evaluate the intrinsic ellipticity of a model ( i.e. the value of the ellipticity of the isophotes before being affected by the seeing ) it is often insufficient to simply measure the ellipticity at one given radial distance .",
    "the ellipticity of the isophotes is reduced by seeing and this reduction depends on the radial distance of the isophote to the centre of the model , the size of the seeing , and the values of the model parameters ( trujillo et al .",
    "2001b , c ) . for that reason",
    ", the determination of the intrinsic ellipticity of the source and the fitting process to determine the structural parameters must be done in tandem ( i.e. iteratively and self  consistently ) .",
    "to do this we simultaneously fit both the observed 1d sb and ellipticity semi  major axis radial profiles using convolved profiles for each .",

    "the elliptical isophotes are measured using the task ellipse within iraf and fitting down to 1.5 @xmath25 ( where @xmath25 is the standard deviation of the sky background of the images ) .",
    "a levenberg  marquardt non  linear fitting algorithm ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) was used to determine the set of free parameters which minimizes @xmath49 .",
    "a variety of starting parameters are used to ensure that our fits do not get trapped in local @xmath49 minima .",
    "the psf was estimated fitting a moffat function to star profiles . the high sampling of the drizzled images that we used and the presence of enough non  saturated stars along the field of view facilitates the estimation of the psf properties by a direct fit to this simple analytical function .",
    "we find that a moffat function with the parameters presented below reproduces the observed psf very well .",
    "we have estimated a @xmath45 per cent uncertainty in the estimation of the fwhm due to changes from one wfpc2 position to another .",
    "in addition , the use of an analytical psf facilitates a robust analytical estimation of the convolution between the psf and the srsic profile .",

    "the advantange of using this method is that we do not rely on any sed model to estimate the luminosity .",

    "in fact , this seems to be a plausible hypothesis to explain the observed luminosity  size evolution found at high  z . according to the studies of the evolution of the stellar mass  to  light ratio ( see e.g. rudnick et al .",
    "2003 ) the stellar populations were younger at high  z , and for that reason , the mass  to  light ratio is a decreasing function with z. consequently , even though the size of the galaxies does not decrease with z , the luminosity evolution of the objects will simulate this effect .",
    "consequently , our observed evolution in the luminosity  size distribution can be alternatively interpreted as a decrease in the central surface brightness of @xmath82 mag at at z@xmath40.7 .",
    "6.0 cm    the results presented here are in agreement with those found by lilly et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , simard et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and ravindranath et al .",
    "these authors do not find a great change from local galaxies out to @xmath0=0.7 and a hint of change at @xmath0@xmath70.7 with shorter objects than those locally observed for a similar magnitude range .",
    "in addition to the sdss distribution and for covering the range of faint galaxies in the relation shown in fig .",
    "[ relumbt]b , we have used a local sample of 200 elliptical galaxies from the virgo , fornax and coma cluster ( caon et al . 1990 ; 1994 ; binggeli & jerjen 1998 ; gutirrez et al .",
    "this sample ranges from -22@xmath1m@xmath83@xmath1 - 12 . to transform to v  band magnitudes",
    "we have used @xmath84=0.9 . to facilitate the comparison with this data , this time we use the semi  major effective radius .",
    "the result of this comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ esocomparison ] .",
    "6.0 cm    it is interesting to note that the observed distribution , with a plateau at the faintest galaxies , is in qualitative good agreement with the distribution of galaxies found in nearby samples .",
    "the apparent absence of evolution in the shape of the distribution of galaxies in the size ",
    "luminosity relation suggests that the early  type galaxies were yet assembled at higher redshift ( fasano et al .",

    "2003 , daddi et al .",
    "2003 , vazdekis , trujillo & yamada 2004 ) .",
    "however , we observe that at a given size , high  z early  type galaxies present higher luminosities than the local sample . to quantify this increase",
    "we have fitted the early  type luminosity ",
    "size relation of the sdss by using an expression of the form : @xmath85 we find the following values : a@xmath86=2.25 and b@xmath86=0.65 .",
    "we have repeated the same exercise this time in our @xmath0@xmath70.5 early  type sample . due to the scarcity of points we have fixed the @xmath87 slope to the same value than the sdss sample . to make the fit we use the points defined by the giant ellipticals ( i.e. those points with l@xmath6@xmath710@xmath9 h@xmath10 l@xmath11 ) . on doing that we find : a@xmath88=1(@xmath50.05 ) .",
    "this implies a factor of @xmath43.5(@xmath50.25 ) greater in luminosity which corresponds to @xmath41.35(@xmath50.10 ) mag .",
    "this is in good agreement with the brightening of 11.5 mag observed in the rest ",
    "frame b  band by i m et al ( 1996 ; 2002 ) and schade et al .",
    "( 1999 ) using the hst medium deep survey and other hst fields .",
    "it is also obtained in large area fields ( bell et al .",
    "it is of interest to note that the comparison between sdss and the hdfs are between field early  type galaxies .",
    "the bright elliptical galaxies in the nearby clusters define a relation with a@xmath89=3.45 .",
    "consequently , we find that early  type galaxies in the hdfs at z@xmath40.7 are a factor of 6.7 brighter in luminosity ( @xmath42 mag ) than the present  day elliptical in clusters . in agreement with previous studies that indicate that early  types in clusters are older than in the field .",
    "we have checked , using a 2d ks , test whether the no  evolution ( versus the passive evolution ) model can be ruled out . to do that we have used only the galaxies with l@xmath6@xmath70.1@xmath810@xmath9 h@xmath10 l@xmath11 and z@xmath70.5 .",
    "this test rejects the no  evolution hypothesis with a confidence larger than than 99.9% .",
    "this luminosity evolution is consistent with models in which the bulk of stars in the field e / s0 galaxies formed before @xmath0@xmath71.5 and have been evolving rather quiescently .",
    "it is of interest to compare the results presented in this paper with the theoretical expectations according to the different scenarios of galaxy formation .    in the hierarchical scenario , following mo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the size of the baryonic component of disc galaxies is expected to scale with redshift as @xmath90 at fixed circular velocity , or @xmath91 at fixed mass . in a flat universe @xmath92=1 ,",
    "the hubble constant evolves with redshift as : @xmath93^{1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath94 are the present  day density parameters . at @xmath0@xmath40.7 ( the mean @xmath0 of our high  z population )",
    ", the expected evolution is 0.68@xmath1r(0.7)/r(0)@xmath10.77 .",
    "this decrease is compatible with our estimation : @xmath430(@xmath510)% .",
    "however , before extracting any conclusion we must take into account that the mo et al .",
    "predictions are for the mass  size relation whereas this work deals with the luminosity  size relation .",
    "in fact , according to previous ( trujillo et al 2004 ) and ongoing ( barden et al . 2004 ; private communication ) work , although the luminosite  size relation has changed dramatically from z@xmath43 , the stellar mass  size relation has remained nearly invariant from then .    in the infall scenario , for the rest ",
    "frame b  band , bouwens & silk ( 2002 ) propose the following dependence in size : r(z)/r(0)=1 - 0.27@xmath0 . at @xmath0=0.7",
    "this corresponds to a decrease of 19% .",
    "this value is in agreement ( although is slightly smaller than the observed ) with our measurements .",
    "contrary to the above predictions of the hierarchical models , the bouwens & silk prediction is for the luminosity  size relation , and consequently , the comparison with our observations is a more direct one .",
    "it is important to note , however , that our analysis is done in the v  band , and the expected evolution from the bouwens & silk ( 2002 ) model could be slightly different in this band .    as pointed out by bouwens & silk ( 2002 ) : `` the hierarchical and infall models predict relatively similar amounts of evolution in global properties ( size , surface brightness , and luminosity ) for disc galaxies to @xmath0@xmath41 '' .",
    "this implies we need to find an extra test for disentangle between both scenarios .",
    "the main difference between both approaches is the evolution of the comoving number density of the objects . in the infall models",
    "is implicitly assumed no number evolution whereas in the hierarchical model the number of disc galaxies , is an increasing function of @xmath0 : n(v@xmath95,z)dv@xmath95 @xmath96 at a fixed circular velocity , or n(l , z)dl @xmath97 , at a fixed luminosity ( see e.g. mao , mo & white 1998 ) .",
    "the scarce number of galaxies in this work and the strong field  to  field variations prevent a definitive answer at this point and larger areas are required .",
    "contrary to the disc galaxies , the number of field e / s0s decreases at high  z in the hierarchical picture .",
    "however , in a flat nonzero @xmath98 universe the semianalytical models predict a weak number density evolution .",
    "this makes difficult to disentangle between the monolithic evolution scenario and the hierarchical view up to @xmath0@xmath41 .",
    "a more definitive answer to this problem will come from studying in detail the population of e / s0s galaxies in the 1@xmath1z@xmath12 interval .",
