    "one of the fundamental problems in the classification of complex surfaces is to find a new family of simply connected surfaces of general type with @xmath0",

    "in particular , simply connected surfaces of general type with @xmath0 are little known and the classification is still open .",
    "therefore it is a very important problem to find a new family of simply connected surfaces with @xmath0 .",
    "although a large number of non - simply connected complex surfaces of general type with @xmath5 have been known ( @xcite , chapter vii ) , until now the only previously known simply connected , minimal , complex surface of general type with @xmath0 was barlow surface @xcite .",

    "the natural question arises if there is a simply connected surface of general type with @xmath0 and @xmath7 .",
    "recently , the second author constructed a new simply connected symplectic @xmath8-manifold with @xmath9 and @xmath1 using a rational blow - down surgery @xcite .",
    "after this construction , it has been a very intriguing question whether such a symplectic @xmath8-manifold admits a complex structure . on the other hand ,",
    "the compactification theory of a moduli space of surfaces of general type was established during the last twenty years .",
    "it was originally suggested in @xcite and it was established by alexeev s proof for boundness  @xcite and by the mori program for threefolds ( @xcite for details ) .",
    "it is natural to expect the existence of a surface with special quotient singularities in the boundary of a compact moduli space . hence it would be possible to construct a new interesting surface of general type by using a singular surface with special quotient singularities",
    "this was also more or less suggested by kollr in a recent paper  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give an affirmative answer for the question above . precisely , we construct a simply connected , minimal , complex surface of general type with @xmath0 and @xmath1 by modifying park s symplectic @xmath8-manifold in  @xcite .",
    "our approach is very different from other classical constructions such as a finite group quotient and a double covering , due to godeaux , campedelli , burniat and others .",
    "these classical constructions are well explained in @xcite .",
    "our main techniques are rational blow - down surgery and @xmath2-gorenstein smoothing theory .",
    "these theories are briefly reviewed and developed in section 2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "we first consider a special cubic pencil in @xmath10 and blow up many times to get a projective surface @xmath11 which contains several disjoint chains of curves representing the resolution graphs of special quotient singularities .",
    "then we contract these chains of curves from the surface @xmath11 to produce a projective surface @xmath12 with five special quotient singularities .",
    "the details of the construction are given in section 3 .",
    "using the methods developed in section 2 , we prove in section 4 that the singular surface @xmath12 has a @xmath2-gorenstein smoothing .",
    "and we also prove in section 5 that the general fiber @xmath13 of the @xmath2-gorenstein smoothing is a minimal surface of general type with @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "finally , applying the standard arguments about milnor fibers ( @xcite  5 , or @xcite  1 ) , we prove that the general fiber @xmath13 is diffeomorphic to a simply connected symplectic @xmath8-manifold @xmath14 which is obtained by rationally blowing down along five disjoint configurations in @xmath11 .",
    "the main result of this paper is the following    [ thm - main ] there exists a simply connected , minimal , complex surface of general type with @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we provide more examples of simply connected surfaces of general type with @xmath0 and @xmath15 in section 6 . by using a different configuration ,",
    "we are also able to construct a minimal , complex surface of general type with @xmath16 and @xmath17  @xcite . furthermore , by a small modification of the main construction and using the same techniques , we also construct simply connected , minimal , complex surfaces of general type with @xmath0 and @xmath18 . these constructions are explained in appendix .    .",

    "similar to construction a1 above , we use the same elliptic fibration on @xmath92 and we use the same notations for @xmath452 as in the main construction in section 3 .",
    "first , we blow up at the intersection points between @xmath175 and the sections @xmath174 respectively , so that the self - intersection numbers of the proper transforms of @xmath176 and @xmath177 are @xmath178 . and we blow up twice successively at each intersection point between the proper transform of @xmath177 and the exceptional curves in the total transforms of @xmath180 , so that it makes two disjoint linear chains of @xmath93 , @xmath453 and @xmath453 , lying in the total transforms of @xmath182 and @xmath184 respectively .",
    "note that this process makes the self - intersection number of the proper transform of @xmath177 to be @xmath458 .",
    "then , using four consecutive @xmath200-spheres in @xmath138-fiber which is not connected to the section @xmath176 together with the proper transform of @xmath177 , we also get a linear chain of @xmath93 , @xmath459 .",
    "hence we finally have a rational surface @xmath460 which contains five disjoint linear chains of @xmath93 : @xmath459 ( which contains the proper transform of @xmath177 and a part of @xmath138-fiber ) , @xmath453 , @xmath453 , @xmath29 ( which is the proper transform of @xmath176 ) and @xmath29 ( which is the proper transform of @xmath170 ) ( figure  [ fig - tz4 ] ) ."
