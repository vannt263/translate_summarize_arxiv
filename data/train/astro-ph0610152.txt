    "the large magellanic cloud may hold the answers to many questions regarding the physical properties of planetary nebulae ( pne ) due to it s known distance of 50kpc ( madore & freedman 1998 , mould et al . 2000 ) and low reddening environment ( e.g. kaler & jacoby , 1990 ) . the lmc is essentially a thin ( @xmath7500pc ) disk inclined at only 35  degrees to our line of sight ( van der marel & cioni 2001 ) so all lmc pne can be considered to reside at a similar distance .",
    "this provides a single environment in which pn mass loss history ( and hence that of intermediate to low mass stars ) can be studied in detail in the context of both stellar and galactic evolution ( jacoby , 2006 ) .",
    "the central 25deg@xmath0 of the lmc galaxy is able to be imaged in its entirety with a wide - field telescope such as the uk schmidt telescope ( ukst ) .",
    "furthermore , it is sufficiently close to enable pne to be detected and resolved using current ground - based telescopes .",
    "prior to our recent work , the number of lmc pne remained modest ( @xmath7300 ) and comprised a small fraction of the expected total ( estimated at @xmath8 , jacoby 1980 , @xmath73000 frew , private communication ) .",
    "however , a large fraction of all lmc pne in the central bar region has now been discovered . with this large and varied population ,",
    "meaningful quantitative determinations of the pn luminosity function , distribution , abundances , excitation ratios , kinematics and crucially mass - loss history , can be estimated precisely for the first time .",
    "we used specially constructed deep , homogeneous , narrow - band h@xmath1 and matching broad - band ` sr ' ( short red ) maps of the entire central 25 deg@xmath0 of the lmc ( for details , see parker et al .",
    "the survey used an exceptional quality , monolithic , 70  fwhm h@xmath1 interference filter ( parker & bland - hawthorn 1998 ) and fine grained tech - pan film as detector ( parker and malin 1999 ) to yield maps with a powerful combination of sensitivity , resolution and area coverage .",
    "these unique maps were obtained by co - adding twelve well - matched ukst 2-hour h@xmath1 exposures and six 15-minute equivalent sr - band exposures on the same field , taken over a 3 year period .",
    "the ` supercosmos ' plate - measuring machine at the royal observatory edinburgh ( hambly et al .",
    "2001 ) scanned , co - added and pixel matched these exposures creating 10@xmath9 m ( 0.67  arcsec ) pixel data which goes 1.35 and 1 magnitudes deeper than individual exposures , achieving the full canonical poissonian depth gain , e.g. bland - hawthorn , shopbell & malin ( 1993 ) .",
    "this gives a depth @xmath721.5 for the sr images and @xmath1022 for h@xmath1 ( @xmath11@xmath4 ) which is at least 1-magnitude deeper than the best wide - field narrow - band lmc images previously available .",
    "the influence of variable stars was alleviated and emulsion defects removed by median stacking exposures taken over the 3 year period .",
    "an accurate world co - ordinate system was applied by matching small point sources across an astrometrically calibrated supercosmos sub - image to the same point positions on the sr and h@xmath1 ukst stacked images .",
    "this yielded sub - arcsec astrometry , essential for success of the spectroscopic follow - up observations .",
    "prior to these results there have been 7 kinematic studies of the lmc pne population which in total represent @xmath7138 objects .",
    "we present new , high quality radial velocities for the 168 previously known and 424 of the newly discovered pne , thereby providing a 400% increase in lmc pn velocity data .",
    "since lmc pne are an object population with an intermediate age between hi  clouds with young star clusters and the old population ii clusters , the extra velocity data is serving to answer questions regarding different lmc rotation solutions and velocity gradients for different populations of different ages ( freeman , illingworth and oemler ( 1983 ) ; meatheringham et al .",
    "radial velocities from our large numbers of new lmc pne have enabled us to distinguish velocity gradients for the young and old pne populations , the results of which may be applied to the kinematic movement of stellar populations .",
    "the full 25 deg@xmath0 area of our lmc deep map was subdivided into 16 separate , non overlapping image cells on a 4 x 4 grid , each with @xmath12 and @xmath13 dimensions of approximately 1@xmath1418@xmath15 .",
    "candidate emission sources were found within each cell using an adaptation of a technique available within karma ( gooch 1996 ) .",
    "the sr and h@xmath1 narrow - band greyscale fits image maps were each assigned an individual colour .",
    "we chose red for the sr map and blue for the h@xmath1 map .",
    "careful selection of software parameters allowed the intensity of each map to be perfectly balanced allowing only peculiarities of one or other pass - band to be observed and measured .",
    "stars without strong emission lines , become a uniform , combined colour while emission objects remain the assigned h@xmath1 colour .",
    "pne and other compact emission objects gained a distinctive ` halo ' defined by the colour assigned to the h@xmath1 image . for more details on the method , see reid & parker ( 2006)(rp1 hereafter ) .    [ section 1 ]",
    "having identified more than 2,000 compact ( dia . @xmath1620",
    "arcsec ) emission sources in the lmc , spectra were required to confirm emission character and object types .",
    "a major spectral confirmation program was undertaken in november and december 2004 comprising 5 nights using 2df on the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) , 7 nights using the 1.9 m at south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) , 3 nights using the flames multi - object spectrograph on the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) ut2 and 7 nights using the 2.3 m australian national university ( anu ) telescope at the siding spring observatory ( sso ) .",
    "finally , in february , 2005 we used 6df on the ukst over three half nights as a final high dispersion multi - object follow - up . for the purpose of this paper we are presenting results obtained from the aat and vlt with added confirmation from the 1.9 m saao and 2.3 m sso observations . in addition , the vlt spectra , which probe faint emission lines in a sub - sample of the newly identified pne , plus the ukst 6df high resolution results , will be the subject of a further paper in this series ( reid & parker in prep ) .    in table  [",
    "table 1 ] we briefly give details regarding the spectroscopic follow - up observations , most of which are described in this paper .",
    "the field names are observation identifications or object names in the case of the 2.3 m observations .",
    "the first three 2df fields , named st .. , are service time runs and were also the subject of rp1 .",
    "observations using 2df on the aat are named a through to o and flames observations on the vlt are named 1 to 9 .",
    "the fields for each of these multi - fibre observations have different central coordinates .",
    "the flames observations were centred on several of the densest areas of the main bar .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ section 8 ]",
    "we present the positions of 460 new true , likely and possible pne in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , together with accurate positions , velocities , diameters and brief object comments .",
    "we have begun to use this new population to explore the kinematics of the central bar region of the lmc and find that the pne population occupies a warped disk with it s own kinematic line of nodes which is also perturbed in a similar tangential direction but to a greater extent than the hi  gas .",
    "the measurement and comparison of pne and hi  indicates that the innermost 2.6 deg bar region has non - circular motions .",
    "we may therefore conclude that the area between the central main bar and the larger lmc disk is slightly warped .",
    "the line of nodes is somewhat twisted at the se and nw edges .",
    "we see small evidence for a warping of the line of nodes in the sw as found by olsen & salyk ( 2002 ) .",
    "all the pne and other objects within the rp survey are soon to be available on the world - wide web including our h@xmath1/sr merged images and low resolution spectra .    [",
