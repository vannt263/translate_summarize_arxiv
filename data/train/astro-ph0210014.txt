    "stephan s quintet ( hickson compact group 92 ; hereafter sq , see fig .",
    "1 ) is one of the best studied examples of a hickson compact group .",
    "it contains four interacting galaxies , ngc  7319 , ngc  7318a , ngc  7318b , and ngc  7317 .",
    "one of its most striking properties is that the major part of the atomic gas is in the intragroup medium ( williams et al .",
    "2002 ) , most likely the result of interactions in the past and present .    a plausible scenario for the dynamical history of sq is presented by moles , sulentic & mrquez ( 1997 ) .",
    "they suggest that a few times 10@xmath3 yr ago the group experienced a collision with ngc  7320c , a galaxy @xmath44@xmath5 to the east of ngc  7319 but with a very similar recession velocity ( 6583 , sulentic et al .",
    "2001 ) to the other galaxies in sq .",
    "this collision removed most of the gas of ngc  7319 towards the west and east , and produced the eastern tidal tail which connects to ngc  7319 .",
    "presently , the group is experiencing another collision , this time with the `` intruder '' galaxy ngc  7318b , with a recession velocity of 5765 , which is affecting strongly the intergalactic medium ( igm ) which was removed during the first collision .",
    "sulentic et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , in a multi - wavelength study of the group , confirm this scenario and suggest that the group has been visited twice by ngc  7320c .",
    "the first collision created the very faint tidal arm east of the interloper ngc  7320 , whereas the second interaction produced the tidal arm which stretches from ngc  7319 eastwards .",
    "this violent dynamical history has induced star formation at various places outside the individual galaxies .",
    "isocam mid - infrared and h@xmath6 observations have revealed a starburst region ( object a in xu , sulentic & tuffs 1999 , hereafter called sq  a ) at the intersection of two faint optical arms stemming north from ngc  7318a / b .",
    "molecular gas has been found at the position of sq  a by gao & xu ( 2000 ) with bima and by smith & struck ( 2001 ) with the nrao 12 m radio telescope .",
    "both the molecular and the atomic gas in this location present two velocity components , centered at about 6000 and 6700 , which implies that they originate from different galaxies .",
    "a second region where several knots of star formation are found to lie outside the main galaxies is in the tidal arm extending from ngc  7319 to the east . at this position ,",
    "identified as b by ( xu et al .",
    "1999 ) and hereafter called sq  b , there is also mid - infrared and h@xmath6 emission , although much weaker than in sq  a. braine et al .",
    "( 2001 ) in a study of the co emission of tdgs detected 2.9@xmath710@xmath3   of molecular gas at the position of sq  b. in order to follow up on these detections and to study the extent , origin and fate of the co in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) in sq , we carried out the single dish survey presented here .",
    "we mapped sq in july 2001 with the iram 30 m telescope in co(10 ) and co(21 ) .",
    "details of the observations and a more complete discussion of the results can be found in lisenfeld et al .",
    "the positions observed are shown in fig .",
    "1 . we mapped ( i ) the region around the intergalactic starburst sq  a , ( ii ) the area around the star forming region along the eastern tidal tail ( sq  b ) and ( iii ) several positions around ngc  7318a / b observed by mendes de oliveira et al .",
    "( 2001 ) in ( labelled as sq  c in fig . 1 ) and suggested to be candidates for tdgs . at these latter positions",
    "no molecular gas was found .    both in sq  a and sq  b we found extended and abundant molecular gas ( see fig . 2 ) , the molecular gas masses being @xmath0  and @xmath1 , respectively , and with spatial extents between 15 and 25 kpc .",
    "the molecular - to - atomic mass ratio is 1.2 ( 0.5 ) for sq  a ( sq  b ) , much higher than typical values found in dwarf and tidal dwarf galaxies ( braine et al .",
    "the integrated intensity ratios are similar ( co(2 - 1)/co(1 - 0)=@xmath8 , respectively @xmath9 ) , consistent with optically thick emission . in both regions , the co and hi",
    "velocities and line shapes agree very well ( fig .",
    "3 ) , although in sq  a the co velocity seems to be shifted slightly to higher velocities with respect to the hi . in sq  a , the co spectrum shows two velocity components , one at about 6000 ( the velocity of the intruder galaxy ngc  7318b ) and the other at 6700  ( the velocity of the rest of the sq galaxies ) .",
    "only the component at 6000  is visible in the individual spectra .",
    "sq  a and sq  b are situated in completely different environments : sq  a is part of the region presently affected by the collision with ngc  7318b and hosts shocks as evidenced through x  ray , radio continuum and  emission .",
    "sq  b is part of the tidal tail situated in a more quiescent area . therefore it is not surprising that in spite of their similarities ( the large amount and extent of the molecular gas , the high molecular - to - atomic gas mass ratio and the similar co(21)/co(10 ) line ratio ) other properties of the molecular gas in sq  a and sq  b are fundamentally different .",
    "the lines in sq  a at 6000  are very broad ( fwhm 6080 , see fig .",
    "3 ) , reflecting the wide range of velocities present in the igm affected by the collision .",
    "the co distribution is rather smooth , spatially offset from the hi emission , with no distinct peak and with only weak emission at the location of the starburst ( in fig .",
    "4 the starburst is situated at the peak of the hi emission coincident with  knots ) . deriving the dynamical mass via a simple estimate from the linewidth and spatial extent , we derive @xmath10 , much larger than the gas and stellar mass in this area ( @xmath11 ) , suggesting that the molecular gas cloud is not gravitationally bound on the size scales at the current resolution .",
    "thus , in sq a , the extended and homogeneous distribution of the molecular gas makes it unlikely that a gravitational collapse is responsible for its formation .",
    "the situation might be different for the emission at 6700 , for which we can not constrain the spatial extent because of the weakness of the lines .",
    "assuming that it closely follows the hi emission at this velocity , which is very concentrated around the starburst , it is likely to be more restricted to the starburst region .    in sq  b , on the other hand , the lines are much narrower ( fwhm 3040 ) and the co distribution peaks at the star forming region in the tidal arm , close to the peak of the hi emission ( fig .",
    "the dynamical mass that can be derived from the co emission @xmath12 ) is comparable to the total gas mass ( @xmath13 ) and suggests that the molecular gas is gravitationally bound .",
    "all this indicates that we are seeing the formation of molecular gas from atomic gas and subsequent star formation .",
    "this finding , together with the position of sq b on the tidal tail and the similarity of its properties to other dwarf galaxies , make it the best candidate for a tdg in sq .",
    "the first intergalactic molecular clouds which were discovered by brouillet , henkel & baudry ( 1992 ) as part of the m  81 group tidal material . later , a similar object was detected in the same group by walter & heithausen ( 1999 ) . in both cases ,",
    "no optical counterpart was found .",
    "these clouds , with masses of less than @xmath14 , might be the first stages of tdgs .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 1999 ) detected @xmath15  in the tidal tail of arp 215 . in a survey of molecular gas in tdgs braine",
    "et al . ( 2000 ) and braine et al . (",
    "2001 ) detected 8 of 11 objects and derived molecular gas clouds between several @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "these studies show that intergalactic molecular gas in tidal features is a normal phenomenon , in which molecular gas is sometimes detected at distances of up to @xmath18 kpc from the parent galaxies . however , the enormous quantities and large extent of molecular gas found in sq are unprecedented .",
