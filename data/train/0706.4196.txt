    "the matrix of inner products of the vectors of weight @xmath134 has determinant @xmath136 so this matrix is positive definite only if @xmath137 .",

    ".    one could continue this analysis level by level , but the computations become rather complicated and in order to find a technique that works for arbitrary @xmath1 one should find a better way of analysing @xmath110 . for this purpose",
    ", we shall construct a different basis for @xmath110 .",
    "this new basis is indicated by the character of @xmath110 : this is a formal infinite series of terms @xmath139 , with @xmath140 a weight of @xmath110 and @xmath141 the dimension of this weight space .",
    "so the vacuum vector @xmath17 of @xmath110 , of weight @xmath142 , yields a term @xmath143 in the character @xmath144 .",
    "since the basis vectors are given by @xmath145 , where @xmath146 , it follows that @xmath147 such expressions have an interesting expansion in terms of schur functions , valid for general @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath148 be a set of @xmath1 variables .",
    "then  @xcite @xmath149 in the right hand side , the sum is over all partitions @xmath150 and @xmath151 is the schur symmetric function  @xcite .    for @xmath1 variables , @xmath152",
    "if the length @xmath153 is greater than @xmath1 , so in practice the sum is over all partitions of length less than or equal to @xmath1 .",
    "for example , for @xmath115 one has @xmath154 the characters of finite dimensional @xmath7 representations ( here @xmath155 ) are given by such schur functions @xmath151 .",
    "hence such expansions are useful since they yield the branching to @xmath7 of the @xmath0 representation @xmath110 . but for such finite dimensional @xmath7 representations labelled by a partition @xmath150 , there is a known basis : the gelfand - zetlin basis ( gz )  @xcite .",
    "we shall use the @xmath7 gz basis vectors as our new basis for @xmath110 . for our current example , @xmath115 ,",
    "the new basis vectors are thus given by : @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the partition @xmath150 of length  2 ( that is @xmath158 and @xmath159 are integers with @xmath160 ) , and the gz pattern @xmath161 satisfies the betweenness condition @xmath162 as @xmath3 is supposed to be fixed , it will usually be dropped from the notation of the vectors @xmath163 , as in  . for such vectors , @xmath157 is the @xmath155 representation label , and @xmath164 is the @xmath155 internal label of the vector @xmath163 .",
    "we assume that the action of the @xmath155 generators is as usual , thus the weight of the vector @xmath163 is given by @xmath165    in this new basis , we need to compute the action of @xmath120 and @xmath121 on the basis vectors @xmath163 .",
    "in fact , it will be sufficient to compute only those of @xmath166 and @xmath167 ( as @xmath168 ) .",
    "then , the relation with the old basis @xmath119 follows implicitly from @xmath169 .    from the triple relations",
    ", it follows that under the @xmath155 basis  , the set @xmath170 forms a tensor of rank ( 1,0 ) , with weights @xmath171 and @xmath172 , and gz patterns @xmath173 therefore , @xmath174 the first factor in the right hand side is a classical @xmath155 clebsch - gordan coefficient ( cgc )  @xcite , and the second factor is a _ reduced matrix element _  @xcite . the possible values of the patterns @xmath175 are determined by the @xmath155 tensor product @xmath176 , and by the additivity property of the internal labels ( @xmath177 in the above expression ) .",
    "so the only @xmath155 cgcs of relevance are given below , their values taken from  @xcite : @xmath178 the problem is thus reduced to finding explicit expressions for two functions @xmath179 and @xmath180 , where @xmath181 we can write : @xmath182 and the action of @xmath64 follows from @xmath183 .",
    "now it remains to determine the functions @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "from the action @xmath184 one deduces the following recurrence relations for @xmath179 and @xmath180 : @xmath185 the action @xmath186 leads to the boundary condition : @xmath187 if @xmath188 . the boundary condition",
    "together with the recurrence relations  - lead to the following solution for the unknown functions @xmath179 and @xmath180 : @xmath189 where the _ even _ and _ odd functions _ @xmath190 and @xmath191 are defined by @xmath192 the solution for @xmath179 and @xmath180 is unique up to a choice of the sign factor . at this moment , only the action of @xmath193 has been used in the process .",
    "now it remains to verify whether the actions of @xmath120 and @xmath121 thus determined do indeed yield a solution , i.e.  one should verify that all triple relations   are satisfied .",
    "this is a straightforward but tedious computation ; the only result provided by this calculation is that the sign factors are restricted .",
    "the choice of sign factors presented in  - is the simplest solution .",
    "so we finally present the complete solution in the case of @xmath12 : @xmath194 where @xmath195    in this whole analysis we have assumed that the parameter @xmath3 is sufficiently large such that all factors appearing under square root symbols are positive , in other words such that @xmath110 itself is irreducible .",
    "the general expressions thus obtained now allow us to examine the structure in more detail .",

    "clearly , these factors tell us when these partitions `` are part of '' the irreducible representation @xmath4 or not ( to be more precise , whether the vectors of the @xmath155 module labelled by @xmath196 belong to @xmath113 or not ) . obviously , for @xmath5 only the top line of the scheme survives , and forms the @xmath155 content of @xmath20 . for @xmath137 ,",
    "all @xmath155 representations @xmath196 survive , and @xmath200 .",
