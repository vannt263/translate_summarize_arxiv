    "over the last decade there has been a lot of research into the possibility that our observable @xmath0-dimensional universe resides on a defect in a higher - dimensional bulk spacetime .",
    "if this is the case , we should be able to construct a model which explains why physics at low energies is insensitive to the extra dimensions .",
    "it has been known for some time that bulk fermions coupled to a scalar field domain - wall have a spectrum containing a zero mode which is localised to the wall  . in the case of a @xmath1-dimensional bulk , this zero mode fermion is chiral and separated by a mass gap from the massive modes , making it well suited to model building efforts .",
    "scalar fields can be localised on the wall in a similar fashion , and in particular , the canonical mexican hat potential can be generated for the lowest lying mode  @xcite .",
    "the gravitational part of the puzzle found a solution in the type 2 randall - sundrum model ( rs2 )  @xcite , where the metric is warped to ensure @xmath0-dimensional gravity is reproduced on an infinitely thin defect .",
    "extensions to smoothed out defects induced by scalar fields have since been constructed ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ) . when combining this warped gravity set up with the fermion and scalar localisation , it is important to ensure that gravity does nt destroy the desirable features of the matter localisation .    for the case of scalar fields , it was first noted in  @xcite that with gravity included , the scalar continuum modes can begin at zero energy . in  @xcite it was shown that this can be true for fermions also , and that introducing a @xmath1-dimensional mass term can produce massive , localised , meta - stable states . due to their coupling to the low lying continuum",
    ", these states can tunnel into the bulk and have a finite lifetime .",
    "@xcite considered a specific model and determined the full mass spectrum of the meta - stable , or quasi - localised , modes and demonstrated that their lifetime could be made longer the age of the universe .",
    "in this paper we present a general analytic argument which demonstrates explicitly that in the presence of rs2-like gravity , the continuum matter modes always begin at zero energy .",
    "it is also demonstrated that the discrete modes present in the gravity - free theory show up in the warped case as resonances of the domain - wall trapping potential , which represent the quasi - localised states . it can be argued that in the presence of interactions , the low - energy non - resonant continuum modes will couple only very weakly to modes localised on the brane .",
    "thus @xmath0-dimensional physics can still be reproduced at low energies .",
    "these considerations are important for realistic model - building  @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : ferm - no - grav ] an overview of localised fermions in the gravity - free case is given , followed by an analysis with gravity included in section  [ sec : ferm - grav ] .",
    "this later section demonstrates that the fermion mass spectrum has a continuum beginning at zero , and that these massive modes can be properly normalised in the presence of the warped metric . in section  [ sec : scalar - grav ]",
    "we repeat the gravitational analysis for a coupled scalar field and show that while the continuum modes begin at zero mass , it is still possible to obtain discrete modes with tachyonic mass , allowing one to realise the higgs mechanism . in section  [ sec : toy - model ] we consider a specific toy model to demonstrate more clearly the effect of gravity , and provide numerical support to the claim that the gravity induced continuum modes are only weakly coupled to a brane - localised zero mode . section  [ sec : concl ] concludes .",
    "we begin with a brief review of the situation without gravity . consider a 5d model containing a number of scalar fields @xmath2",
    ". these will form our classical background .",
    "the action is , @xmath3 here @xmath4 is a 5d lorentz index and repeated indices are summed .",
    "the only additional assumptions we make are that @xmath5 has a @xmath6 symmetry @xmath7 , such that the global minimum of @xmath5 is at least doubly degenerate , and attained for ( say ) @xmath8 .",
    "we also require this @xmath6 to be independent of any continuous symmetries of the theory .",
    "we suppose we have a solution @xmath9 depending only on the coordinate @xmath10 , satisfying the boundary conditions @xmath11 as @xmath12 .",
    "such a solution is topologically stable , and can be used as a classical background for a quantum field theory  @xcite .    now introduce a fermion field @xmath13 into the model , and yukawa - couple it to the domain - wall .",
    "its action will be , @xmath14 where the @xmath15 are yukawa coupling constants and @xmath16 with @xmath17 the usual 4d dirac matrices and chirality operator , respectively .",
    "the action of the @xmath6 symmetry is extended to include @xmath18 and @xmath19 . for simplicity",
    "we have also imposed a global @xmath20 symmetry @xmath21 , to forbid a term @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , in the classical background discussed above , the dirac equation will be , @xmath23 \\psi(x^\\mu , y ) = 0 .",
    "\\label{eq : dirac}\\ ] ] to solve this equation , we separate variables by expanding @xmath13 in a generalised fourier series , @xmath24,\\ ] ] where the @xmath25 are left- and right - handed 4d spinors , and are treated independently due to the association of @xmath26 with @xmath10 . the sum over @xmath27 generally includes an integral over continuum parts .",
    "we choose our basis functions such that the @xmath25 satisfy the 4d dirac equation , @xmath28 we can then solve eq .   for @xmath29 . in the @xmath30 case",
    ", we get the decoupled equations ( hereafter , primes denote differentiation with respect to @xmath10 ) , @xmath31 the solutions are , @xmath32 the boundary conditions satisfied by the @xmath33 then give generically that if @xmath34 the left - handed component of @xmath13 is localised near @xmath35 , where @xmath36 ( the existence of such a point follows from the boundary conditions ) , while the right - handed component is non - normalisable , and thus unphysical .",
    "this is the well - known result that a domain - wall localises chiral fermions  .",
    "more interesting is the case @xmath37 .",
    "we then get the following equation for @xmath38 , @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "is just a schrdinger equation with eigenvalue @xmath41 .",
    "the potential @xmath42 is a finite well , and @xmath43 as @xmath12 .",
    "therefore the normalisable solutions will consist of a number of discrete bound states , as well as a continuum starting at some non - zero energy .",
    "thus the 4d fermion spectrum contains a massless left - handed particle , a finite number of massive dirac particles with discrete masses , and a continuum of massive dirac particles beginning at @xmath44 .",
    "explicit solutions to one specific model can be found in  @xcite .",
    "to include gravity in these models , we simply add the einstein - hilbert term to the action , and minimally couple other fields to gravity as usual , to obtain the background action @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the 5d metric , @xmath47 its determinant , @xmath48 the 5d planck mass , @xmath49 the 5d ricci scalar , and @xmath50 the bulk cosmological constant .",
    "now we must solve the coupled einstein and klein - gordon equations associated with  .",
    "we again assume that the solution @xmath9 depends only on @xmath10 , and satisfies the same boundary conditions as earlier .",
    "the resulting equations have been solved by various authors  @xcite and here we merely point out the general features .",
    "the solution for the metric is given by , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a smooth even function of @xmath10 , and @xmath53 as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is some mass scale .",
    "in the rs2 model , the domain - wall is instead a delta - function brane , and @xmath56 everywhere . the effective 4d graviton spectrum , corresponding to fluctuations around the metric in eq .  , was shown to consist of a single massless mode , followed by a continuum of massive modes starting arbitrarily close to zero mass  @xcite .",
    "contrary to nave expectations , this does not contradict the assertion that the low - energy theory is 4 dimensional .",
    "in fact , the integrated effect of the continuum modes at the position of the brane is negligible at low energies , due to the suppression of their wavefunctions near the brane .",
    "cski et al .",
    "have shown that the same result holds in the present context of smooth rs - like spacetimes @xcite .",
    "we will demonstrate in this and the next section that similar statements are true for fermions and scalar fields coupled to the above background .    with gravity",
    "included , the formulation of the dirac lagrangian requires the introduction of the vielbein @xmath57 ( here @xmath58 is an ` internal ' lorentz index ) and the spin connection @xmath59 , given for the metric in eq .   by , @xmath60 these yield the spin - covariant derivative @xmath61 , and curved space gamma matrices @xmath62 , so that the fermion action is , @xmath63 the resulting dirac equation is , @xmath64 \\psi(x^\\mu , y ) = 0.\\ ] ]    we again decompose @xmath13 into 4d chiral components , and obtain equations for the extra - dimensional profiles @xmath38 . as long as the value @xmath65 is large enough , the conclusions are unchanged in the massless case ( see eg .",
    "for @xmath37 we get the following equations , @xmath66 f_{l , r}^n          = m_n^2 e^{2 \\sigma } f_{l , r}^n , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 .",
    "the inclusion of gravity has meant that eq .",
    "is no longer simply a schrdinger equation , so we ca nt directly apply our knowledge of 1d quantum mechanics .",
    "it is however possible to transform eq .   into a schrdinger equation .",
    "specifically , we let @xmath68 , and change coordinates to @xmath69 such that @xmath70 ( this is in fact a change to ` conformal coordinates ' , in which @xmath71 ) .",
    "eq .   becomes , @xmath72 \\tilde{f}_{l , r}^n      = m_n^2 \\tilde{f}_{l , r}^n.\\ ] ] we thus identify the effective potential , @xmath73 as @xmath54 , @xmath74 , which in terms of @xmath75 becomes @xmath76 as @xmath77 .",
    "as @xmath77 , we have @xmath78 , and therefore the effective potential decays towards zero at large distances from the brane ( see fig .  [ fig : pot ] for some specific cases ) .",
    "indeed , it is an example of a ` volcano potential ' , familiar from analysis of the graviton sector  @xcite .",
    "particles subjected to @xmath79 are essentially free asymptotically , so there is a continuum of delta - function normalisable solutions for all @xmath80 .",
    "we will now show that normalisability of @xmath81 implies appropriate normalisability of @xmath82 , and conclude that our dimensionally reduced theory contains a continuum of fermions starting at zero mass .",
    "the @xmath83 satisfy an ordinary schrdinger equation with a continuum of eigenvalues , and therefore are delta - function orthonormalisable , @xmath84 on the other hand , the normalisation condition for the @xmath82 can be derived by demanding that integrating the action in eq .   over @xmath10",
    "leads to a properly normalised 4d kinetic term , viz .",
    "@xmath85 substituting in the expressions for the vielbein and metric , this condition becomes , @xmath86 and similarly for the right - handed components ( overlap integrals between right- and left - handed components do not enter ) .",
    "however , if we write @xmath87 in terms of @xmath83 and use @xmath88 , we see that , @xmath89 so the normalisation integral for the @xmath87 is equivalent to the normalisation integral for the @xmath83 .",
    "therefore there is a continuum of normalisable fermion modes in the theory , starting at zero 4d mass . despite this",
    ", the zero modes still form an effective 4d theory at low energies",
    ". we can understand this as follows .",
    "flat space corresponds to @xmath90 , and we have seen that in this case the low - energy spectrum consists of a finite number of particles with discrete masses .",
    "the reason for this is that the effective potential of the analogue schrdinger system , given in eq .",
    ", asymptotes to a non - zero value ; the discrete spectrum corresponds to modes bound in the potential well near @xmath91 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath52 is non - zero , but grows only very slowly with @xmath92 . in this case ,",
    "the effective potential in eq .   approximates that of eq .   near the brane",
    ", then decays towards zero as @xmath54 .",
    "we thus have a localised non - zero potential in the form of a narrow well flanked by wide barriers .",
    "the low - energy continuum eigenfunctions of such a system will generically have very small amplitudes at the position of the well , due to the potential barrier which they must tunnel through .",
    "so although arbitrarily light fermions will exist in the theory , their wavefunctions will be strongly suppressed at the position of the brane , where the zero modes reside .",
    "they are effectively ` localised at infinity ' .",
    "this leads to a very small probability of these low - energy continuum modes interacting with the zero modes .",
    "there is one more generic feature which we expect to occur .",
    "certain discrete energies will resonate with the potential , and the corresponding states will thus have a much larger probability of being found on the brane .",
    "these are the remnants of the discrete bound states in the flat space case , and become coincident with them in the zero - gravity limit . what happens if one of these resonant modes is produced in a high - energy process on the brane ?",
    "any particle produced on the brane will have a wavefunction truly localised to the brane , and thus can not correspond exactly to a single mode @xmath93 , which has a wavefunction oscillatory as @xmath94 .",
    "instead it will be a wavepacket made from the continuum modes , with a fourier spectrum peaked around one of the resonances .",
    "therefore it is not a true energy / mass eigenstate , and as the various components become out of phase , the wavefunction will leak off the brane .",
    "the particle then has some probability of escaping the brane , which justifies the moniker  quasi - stable \" or  quasi - localised \" for the resonant modes .",
    "it is these resonant quasi - localised states that are investigated in  @xcite .",
    "quantitative calculations confirming the above conclusions will be given for a particular toy model in section  [ sec : toy - model ] .",
    "as well as fermions , it is desirable for model building purposes to be able to localise scalar fields to the wall . in flat space ,",
    "the results are similar to those for fermions , except that the mass - squared of the lightest mode depends on parameters in the 5d theory  @xcite ( whereas in the fermion case , it is always zero ) . it can even be arranged to be negative , so as to realise the higgs mechanism in the low - energy theory .",
    "we will now examine the effects of gravity on these results .",
    "we consider a scalar field @xmath95 described by the action , @xmath96 where @xmath97 specifies the coupling of @xmath95 to itself and to the domain - wall .",
    "the linearised equation of motion for @xmath95 is given by , @xmath98 where @xmath99 is independent of @xmath95 , and defined by @xmath100 .",
    "we solve this exactly the same way as in the fermion case : @xmath101 where each @xmath102 satisfies a 4d klein - gordon equation , @xmath103 the analogue of eq .",
    "is then , @xmath104 we can convert this to a schrdinger equation by again going to the conformal coordinate @xmath75 , as well as making the substitution @xmath105 . this yields , @xmath106 \\tilde{h}^n          = m_n^2 \\tilde{h}^n.\\ ] ] as @xmath77 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 _ constant _ , so we can see immediately that , as in the fermion case , the effective potential decays towards zero far from the brane . therefore the low - energy scalar spectrum also contains a continuum of modes of arbitrarily small mass , which are properly normalisable , as can be shown by a calculation analogous to that described above for the fermions .    if @xmath109 , the above equation is in fact identical to that satisfied by 4d gravitons in the background of eq .",
    "ref  @xcite ) . in this case",
    "then , we know that there is a single zero mode , followed by a continuum of modes starting arbitrarily close to @xmath110 . the low lying continuum modes are strongly suppressed on the brane ; for example , their contribution to a static potential generated by @xmath95 exchange between two sources on the brane separated by @xmath111 , is suppressed by @xmath112 relative to the contribution of the zero mode .    for non - zero @xmath99 , the spectrum is modified from the graviton case , the significant difference being the possible introduction of resonant modes ( in the absence of fine - tuning of parameters , there will no longer be a zero mode ) .",
    "as in the fermion case , these resonant modes correspond to the discrete bound modes in the corresponding gravity - free theory and we expect the first of these modes to occur for @xmath113 . unlike the fermion case , if appropriate coupling to the domain - wall is included , such that @xmath99 makes some negative contribution to the effective potential , then there may be bound state solutions with @xmath114 , as in the gravity - free case  @xcite .",
    "this signals an instability in the system , and implies that @xmath95 is non - zero in the stable background configuration . in this case",
    "we would have to instead solve the coupled einstein and klein - gordon equations including the @xmath2 fields _ and _ @xmath95 .",
    "this setup can be used for interesting model building , in which a symmetry is broken on the brane but restored in the bulk .",
    "this idea has been used in the flat space case in ref .",
    "we sketch the reasoning following ref .",
    "take the scalar potential @xmath115 where we have specialised to a single background field @xmath116 , and we assume @xmath117 such that @xmath118 are still the global minima of the potential , and we must have @xmath119 as @xmath120 . if @xmath116 forms a domain wall , then @xmath121 inside the wall , so that the leading term of @xmath122 is @xmath123 , suggesting that the @xmath124 solution is unstable there .",
    "this will show up as a negative eigenvalue @xmath114 in equation  , and solving for a consistent set of background solutions will yield a background @xmath95 that is peaked on the brane and tending to zero in the bulk .",
    "putting @xmath95 in a non - trivial representation of some gauge group will induce spontaneous breaking of that group on the brane , a mechanism which can be used , for example , to realise the standard model higgs mechanism on the brane .    in the stable case then , asymptotically @xmath99 will approach some constant positive value @xmath125 . as @xmath77 , we can approximate the effective potential @xmath126 as follows : @xmath127 again we can appeal to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is shown that for a potential that behaves asymptotically as @xmath128 , the amplitudes of modes with small @xmath129 are suppressed by @xmath130 .",
    "therefore the coupling to the domain - wall actually reduces the effect of the continuum modes on low energy physics .",
    "the above conclusions can be illustrated concretely by finding numerical results for a specific case .",
    "we will make use of a background solution found in ref .",
    "@xcite in which a single real scalar field forms the domain - wall . the stability of this solution is demonstrated in ref .",
    "the solutions for the warp factor and scalar field are , @xmath131 where @xmath132 is proportional to the 5d newton s constant , and the solution corresponds to a 5d cosmological constant given by @xmath133 .",
    "the scalar field potential which admits this solution is , @xmath134 we d like to study a fermion field @xmath13 in the above background to illustrate the existence and suppression of the low - lying continuum modes .",
    "we again impose a global @xmath20 symmetry @xmath135 so that @xmath13 only couples to the background via a term @xmath136 .",
    "for the sake of examining interactions later , we also include a scalar field @xmath95 , which @xmath20 acts on via @xmath137 , to mediate interactions between @xmath13 quanta , because the fermion zero mode is chiral , and thus does not interact with @xmath116 via the term @xmath136 . additionally , while the modes of @xmath116 mix with scalar gravitational degrees of freedom , the global @xmath20 symmetry prevents such a mixing of @xmath95 modes . ] , and",

    ", @xmath124 must be the stable solution i.e. eq .",
    "must not have any negative eigenvalues .",
    "choosing @xmath140 suffices to guarantee this .",
    "the effective schrdinger equation for the fermion field is found as described in section  [ sec : ferm - grav ] .",
    "for various values of @xmath141 , the resulting effective potential felt by the left chiral component of the fermion is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pot ] .",
    "it does indeed asymptote to zero when gravity is included , implying the existence of a continuum of arbitrarily light modes .",

    "the dominant process by which they could be detected in our toy model is two zero mode particles annihilating to produce two continuum particles via exchange of a @xmath95 quantum , so this is the process we will consider .",
    "as explained at the end of section  [ sec : ferm - grav ] , a @xmath95 quantum produced on the brane will not correspond to a single mass mode , but will be a wavepacket initially localised on the brane .",
