    "for significant quantum effects to appear in the transport properties of a conductor , it must be shorter than the distance over which an electron propagates without losing its quantum coherence , which for usual metals at low temperatures ( < 1k ) is on the order of microns .",
    "the exploration of this quantum transport regime started in the early 1980s with the observation of aharonov - bohm interferences in submicron metallic rings @xcite .",
    "a very powerful point of view , put forward by r. landauer @xcite , describes a transport experiment across a coherent conductor as the scattering of the quantum electronic waves injected by the contact probes . in other words ,",
    "the conductor is viewed as an electronic waveguide , whose modes , called `` conduction channels '' , are each characterized by a transmission probability . for example , the total conductance is given by the famous landauer formula : @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of channels , the @xmath2 are the individual transmission probabilities , and @xmath3 the conductance quantum .",
    "in fact , in systems with non - interacting quasiparticles all transport quantities can be expressed in terms of the transmission probability set @xmath4 , which is viewed in this framework as the  personal identity number  ( pin code ) of the conductor @xcite . for most systems ,",
    "the number of conduction channels is very large , and the description of transport can only be based on a distribution function for the transmission eigenvalues . however , the number of channels can be significantly reduced if the lateral dimensions of a conductor become comparable to the fermi wavelength of the electrons .",
    "this was demonstrated in 1988 using constrictions tailored in the two - dimensional electron gas of a semiconductor heterostructure , with a width adjustable on the scale of the fermi wavelength ( @xmath5 ) by means of an electrostatic gate @xcite . in these `` quantum point contacts '' , as the constriction width is continuously decreased , a descending staircase conductance curve is observed , beautifully illustrating the closing of the channels one after another . since",
    "then much activity has been devoted worldwide to the investigation of transport through a broad range of coherent conductors ( diffusive and ballistic conductors , quantum dots , nanowires , individual molecules like carbon nanotubes ) connected to reservoirs in the normal or in the superconducting state @xcite .    among the various systems investigated ,",
    "atomic - size contacts @xcite between three - dimensional metallic electrodes play an important role .",
    "these contacts have been accessible since the early years of stm @xcite , and more stable ones were achieved at the beginning of the 1990s by the group of jan van ruitenbeek at leiden using the break - junction technique @xcite .",
    "since their characteristic transverse dimensions are of the order of the fermi wavelength ( typically @xmath6 ) , atomic contacts accommodate only a small number of channels and behave as quantum point contacts even at room temperature .",
    "an interesting difference with respect to quantum point contacts in 2d electron systems is that superconductivity can be built - in with the proper choice of material .",
    "the discovery by our group in 1997 that the pin - code could be accurately measured for every contact @xcite paved the way to a new generation of quantum transport experiments in which the measured transport quantities could be compared to the theoretical predictions with no adjustable parameters . as an example , we describe here our experiments on the supercurrent flowing through atomic - size contacts .",
    "they probe the main concepts of the `` mesoscopic '' theory of the josephson effect , _",
    "i.e. _ the theory in terms of the transmission probability of the channels , that we sketch in section 3 .",
    "before discussing previous and on - going experiments in sections 4 and 5 respectively , we describe the microfabrication technique that has made possible the experiments and the procedure we use to determine the pin - code of atomic - size contacts in section 2 .",
    "in order to produce atomic contacts we developed the microfabricated break - junction ( mbj ) technique @xcite . using electron beam lithography and reactive ion etching , a metallic bridge clamped to an elastic substrate is suspended over a few microns between two anchors ( see left panel of fig .",

    "although similar staircase patterns are observed every time the experiment is performed , the horizontal extension ( of the order of a fraction of nanometer ) and the vertical position of the plateaus are not always the same for subsequent compression - extension cycles .",

    "consequently , the @xmath13 characteristic depends on all powers of every transmission coefficient and carries sufficient information to reconstruct the pin code .",
    "the determination of the pin code of any atomic - size contact is achieved by decomposing the measured total current into a series of such elementary characteristics , each of them corresponding to a well defined transmission probability .",

    "typically , for channels with a large transmission the relative uncertainty achieved on @xmath2 is of the order of @xmath14 for channels having low transmissions @xmath15 , the procedure fails to disentangle the contributions of the different channels , and yields a larger error bar ( see chapter  1 of @xcite for details ) .    using this method we showed that for one - atom contacts the number of conduction channels is directly related to the number of valence orbitals of the metal @xcite . for aluminum and lead , which have p - electrons at the fermi level",
    ", three channels were found to contribute to the conductance of the smallest contacts . for niobium , a transition metal with s- and d - electrons , five conduction channels were found . in the case of gold , with one s - electron , and for which superconductivity was induced through the proximity effect by intimate contact with a thick aluminum layer , we found that only one conduction channel contributes to the conductance on the lowest conductance plateau @xcite .",
    "in 1962 , josephson predicted that a dc current could flow at zero bias voltage between two superconducting electrodes coupled by a tunnel barrier @xcite .",

    "a unifying theoretical description providing this relation for an arbitrary structure in terms of its transmission pin emerged in the 1990s and is based on the concept of andreev bound states @xcite .    due to the existence of a gap in the quasiparticle density of states in a superconductor ,",
    "an electron impinging from a normal metal into a superconducting electrode with an energy @xmath21 can not enter it as such , and should in principle be reflected back .",

    "the current - phase relation measured at low temperatures is in quantitative agreement with the mesoscopic description of the josephson effect , considering that only the ground andreev state is occupied in each channel .",
    "the next step in order to achieve a comprehensive test of the theory would be to probe the excited andreev states for example by directly performing spectroscopy of the transitions between andreev levels .",
    "however , during our first attempts to do so , we observed unexpected but important phenomena which shed light on the microscopic nature of the system .",
    "the experiments presented in the previous sections were performed with atomic - squids obtained on sample # 1 , which was fabricated on top of a metallic substrate and in which the on - chip lines connecting the squid to the outside world were made out of gold , a dissipative metal at low temperature . on the contrary in our first design to attempt microwave andreev spectroscopy , in order to minimize dissipation which is expected to limit the life - time of the excited andreev levels @xcite and",
    "thus broaden the spectral lines , we decided to fabricate the samples on kapton substrates with all on - chip electrodes made out of aluminum .",
    "apart from this change of material sample # 2 was almost identical to the previous one and in particular the critical current of the junction was @xmath97 , less than @xmath98 smaller than before .",
    "however , as we will discuss now , this change of material had strong consequences on the overall behavior of the system .",
    "period ) each voltage pulse corresponds to a switching event . *",
    "left * : at a flux value for which the @xmath99 curve is normal .",
    "* right * : similar measurement , at a flux value for which @xmath99 displays a step , showing intermittency attributed to the dynamics of single quasiparticle trapping and untrapping in the andreev doublet.[fig : bunching ] ]    the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : modpswit](b ) shows the measured switching probability as a function of both the flux and the reduced bias current for a squid with an atomic contact of transmissions @xmath100 in sample#2 . as compared to the previous sample ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : modpswit](a ) ) the switching probability @xmath99 does not vary sharply from 0 to 1 for all values of the flux . in some flux ranges , it displays a step as a function of the bias current , as shown for @xmath101 in the left panel of the same figure .",
    "these features appear only in a region bounded by the expected modulation curve @xmath88 and by a second modulation curve calculated without the contribution of the highest transmitted channel .",
    "in other words , in this region the highest transmitted channel does not seem to always contribute to the total current through the contact .",
    "this is exactly what is expected if the two andreev states of this channel are either both empty or both occupied , an occupation configuration achieved when a single quasiparticle is trapped in the andreev doublet as discussed in section 3.2 . since the andreev states have energies below the superconducting gap the quasiparticles are easily trapped .",
    "the fact that this effect only appears on samples having no large normal electrodes able to efficiently remove the quasiparticles strongly supports this hypothesis .",
    "moreover , if trapping happens in a flux region for which the critical current gets enhanced by the double occupancy , subsequent current pulses of the same height would be unable to make the system switch .",
    "it is only after the quasiparticle gets untrapped that switching occurs again .",
    "this results in intermittency of switching as quasiparticles trap and untrap , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bunching ] .",
    "recently , we have measured the full dynamics of trapping and found that the lifetime of trapped quasiparticles can be quite long , on the order of @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "as shown in the previous section , up to now only the properties of the andreev ground state have been probed in detail . performing spectroscopy of the transition between two andreev states",
    "is clearly the next important step which we are presently pursuing along two different lines .",
