    "the role of electron correlations in high - temperature superconductors ( htsc ) based on iron @xcite is decisive in the formation of physical properties of such systems .",
    "the effect of strong coulomb interactions on the nature of superconductivity and the formation of a complex phase diagram including antiferromagnetic , structural and superconducting ordering , is a major focus of interest  @xcite .",
    "like copper htsc , iron - based superconductors are characterized by a strongly expressed anisotropy , and have a structure of closely spaced atomic planes of fe and as ( for pnictides ) .",
    "the main contribution to the band structure near the fermi surface is provided by two orbitals , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the simplest model hamiltonian for iron - based htsc reflecting their crystal and electronic structure , is the two - dimensional generalized two - orbital hubbard model @xcite , which has been intensively studied since the discovery of iron - based htsc with the use of various approximate analytical and numerical methods .",
    "the mean - field approximation was used in @xcite to determine the magnetic order parameter and the electron density of states ; the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter was investigated in @xcite using the random - phase approximation .",
    "numerical methods generally also use various simplifications for modeling the hamiltonian of the two - orbital model .",
    "charge stripes states were obtained in @xcite within the real - space hartree - fock approximation away from the half - filling .",

    "exact numerical simulations of the two - orbital model , which include the method of exact diagonalization and the quantum monte carlo algorithms , are also limited in their applications . the problem of the two - orbital model for pnictides was solved in full by the exact diagonalization technique in @xcite ; however , the maximum size of the lattice , which one could managed to diagonalize , was @xmath3 .    the applicability of finite - size cluster quantum monte carlo algorithms that allow , in principle , to obtain exact results ,",
    "is limited in this case by the sign problem , which exponentially slows calculations at a sufficiently low temperature and/or away from the half - filling .    in this work , with choosing specific basis states for the hamiltonian of the two - orbital model and the use of ctwl - algorithm @xcite",

    "accurate accounting of non - diagonal four - fermion terms @xmath7 which can play a key role in the formation of correlation properties , and which , from our point of view , can not be neglected , is the main feature of our algorithm .    using the relationship between matsubara green s function and the density of electron states ,",
    "we have derived the momentum distribution and the fermi liquid parameters of the model : quasi - particle weight ( @xmath0-factor ) , self - energy @xmath8 , and scattering rate @xmath9 , and studied the properties of the model under doping .",
    "the momentum distribution have a clear jump near the fermi level ; the value of this jump is sensitive to the strength of the interaction .",
    "the asymmetry in the behavior of @xmath0-factor was observed at electron and hole doping , which reflects the asymmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "the evolution of the fermi surface was studied at changing the model parameters and the level of doping ; it is shown that the `` hard - band approximation '' is acceptable for the analysis of the topology of the fermi surface at low doping and finite value of the interaction .",

    "first introduced in @xcite , the two - orbital model for iron - based htsc takes into account the real crystal structure of these compounds , as well as the two - dimensional nature of physical properties .",
    "provided that the main contribution to the formation of the band structure near the fermi level make @xmath10-states of iron atoms @xcite , the hamiltonian of the model is presented as follows :    @xmath11    @xmath12    @xmath13    here operator @xmath14 creates ( annihilates ) an electron with spin projection @xmath15 on site @xmath16 * * and orbital @xmath17 ; @xmath18 are hopping amplitudes between orbitals @xmath17 ; @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are coulomb interaction terms ; @xmath22 is the chemical potential . in this work",
    "we used the quantum continuous time world - line monte carlo algorithm ( ctwl - algorithm ) , adapted for the two - orbital model @xcite .",
    "the algorithm is free from wick s decomposition and allows the calculation of the matsubara green s function and obtaining information about the quasiparticle spectrum and its dependence on temperature and interaction parameters .",
    "according to our studies @xcite , the exchange term is important for the correct description of the correlation properties of the system and the manifestation of a certain type of pairing symmetry . at the same time , this term is what distinguishes the model from the usual generalized hubbard model , and leads to difficulties in the implementation of the simulation by quantum monte carlo algorithm .",
    "each term of the hamiltonian should be considered separately for inclusion in the scheme of the algorithm .",
    "all the features of the numerical modeling , encoding of the basic states , and calculation of correlation functions and green s function in the framework of the ctwl algorithm are described in detail in @xcite .",

    "an off - diagonal term of the form @xmath31 has been added in the calculation . here",
    "on the one hand , such addition to the hamiltonian does not modify the calculation results within the accuracy achieved , and on the other hand , the input of such controlled off - diagonal term substantially `` animates '' the statistics and increases the speed of convergence .",
    "in addition , the presence of this term allows directly accumulate statistics on matsubara green s function in the world - line algorithm .",
    "actually , the momentum distribution @xmath33 can be obtained from the relation @xmath34 direct approximation in a numerical calculation leads to uncontrolled errors ; therefore , we have used the following expression : @xmath35    normalization of @xmath36 was made on the average occupation numbers of orbitals calculated independently in the same calculation for a given chemical potential . to calculate ,",
    "the spectral function @xmath37 and the total density of states @xmath38 were recovered from the integral equation relating the spectral function with matsubara green s function , @xmath39 with the use of a stochastic procedure , the details of which are explained in section v.",
    "it should be noted that the results for clusters with the size of @xmath40 feas - cells and larger were no longer depended on the system size indicating the applicability of the results for the analysis of the properties of a macroscopic system .",

    "we were not able to investigate the features of superconducting correlations at that temperature , but succeeded in obtaining the overall picture of the band structure and the momentum distribution .",
    "the fermi level was determined by half - filling of the distribution ( see @xcite for the peculiarities of determining the fermi surface ( fs ) at nonzero interaction and @xmath44 ) . in the graphs , it is seen as a rather abrupt change of occupation numbers , and , in a first approximation , it coincides with the maximum gradient of the momentum distribution ( fig .",

    "this invariance of the fs for feas - systems was reported in @xcite , and , in addition , was demonstrated in the framework of the extended hubbard model @xcite .",

    "the value of dos at the fermi level increases slightly with increasing the hole doping .    therefore , the change of the number of carriers in the system is not equivalent to a simple filling of the bands ( the so - called `` hard - band approximation '' ) , i.e. , to a simple shift of the chemical potential at a constant density of states , which is the contribution of coulomb correlations in this typical generalized hubbard model .",

    "<S> the two - dimensional two - orbital hubbard model is studied with the use of finite - size cluster world - line quantum monte carlo algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> this model is widely used for simulation of the band structure of feas clusters , which are structure elements of fe - based high - temperature superconductors . the choice of a special basis set of hyper - sites allowed to take into account four - fermion operator terms and to overcome partly the sign problem . </S>",
    "<S> spectral functions and the density of states for various parameters of the model are obtained in the undoped and low - doped regimes . </S>",
    "<S> the correlated distortion of the spectral density with the change of doping is observed , and the applicability of the `` hard - band '' approximation in the doped regime is demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> profiles of the momentum distribution are obtained for the first brillouin zone ; they have pronounced jump near the fermi level , which decreases with the growth of the strength of the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the invariance of the fermi surface with respect to the strength of the interaction is testified . </S>",
    "<S> nesting is found in the case of electron and hole doping . </S>",
    "<S> fermi - liquid parameters of the model are derived . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0-factor grows sharply with the increasing the level of doping , and monotonously decreases with the growth of the strength of the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , electron - hole doping asymmetry of the @xmath0-factor is revealed . </S>",
    "<S> the non - fermi liquid behaviour and the deviation from luttinger theorem are observed .    </S>",
