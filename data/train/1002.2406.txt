    "ultrarelativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions performed at rhic indicate that , in the vicinity of the deconfinement critical temperature , the quark - gluon plasma can behave more like liquid than a dilute gas of quarks and gluons .",
    "one indication of this kind is the experimentally found common velocity of different species of particles , which are emitted from the expanding fireball of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the corresponding experimental results  @xcite can be successfully described by the relativistic hydrodynamics of an almost non - viscous liquid  @xcite .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of an ideal ( i.e. absolutely non - viscous ) liquid has the form  @xcite @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the entropy density , and @xmath3 is the velocity of energy transport .",
    "the principal deviation from the ideality is described by a correcting term @xmath4 , which depends on the derivatives of the velocity linearly : @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "the temperature - dependent coefficients , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are called respectively the shear and the bulk viscosities .",
    "together , they are called first - order transport coefficients of the liquid .    in hydrodynamics  @xcite , the shear viscosity characterizes a change in shape of a fixed volume of the liquid , whereas the bulk viscosity characterizes a change in volume of the liquid of a fixed shape .",
    "in particular , the bulk viscosity enters the navier ",
    "stokes equation through the term @xmath10 , being therefore relevant only when @xmath11 , i.e. for compressible liquids .",
    "the shear viscosity enters the navier ",

    "@xcite , show the minimum of the shear - viscosity to the entropy - density ratio ( @xmath13 ) and the maximum of the bulk - viscosity to the entropy - density ratio ( @xmath14 ) in the vicinity of the liquid - gas phase - transition critical temperature . given different types of liquid - gas phase transitions and different types of molecules for these three substances",
    ", one can guess that the temperature - behaviors of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are universal , and thus can be qualitatively the same also for the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "furthermore , it is worth noticing that the ( @xmath13)-ratio has been calculated in @xmath0 sym theory  @xcite , where it equals to the temperature - independent constant @xmath15 .",
    "[ note that , since @xmath0 sym theory is a conformal field theory , its deconfinement phase can start only right at @xmath16 , for which reason one should not expect any temperature - dependence of the ( @xmath13)-ratio .",
    "] this constant is at least by one order of magnitude smaller than the minima of the above - mentioned empirical results for water , helium , and nitrogen , as well as the values of the ( @xmath13)-ratio in perturbative qcd .",
    "such a smallness of this ratio in @xmath0 sym has led to the widely known conjecture that the finite - temperature version of @xmath0 sym provides ( a theoretic example of ) the most perfect quantum liquid .",
    "for example , at the temperature of 200  mev , the length of a mean free path of a parton traversing such a liquid is as small as @xmath170.1  fm . however , since @xmath0 sym is a conformal field theory , the bulk viscosity @xmath9 in this theory is strictly zero . that makes @xmath0 sym different from the real qcd , where the effects of non - conformality are essential ( e.g. in the so - called interaction measure @xmath18 ) up to the temperatures as high as @xmath19 times the deconfinement critical temperature @xmath20 .",
    "in a quantum field theory , the contributions of various fields to the viscosities can be calculated by means of the kubo formulae .",
    "a kubo formula is an integral equation , which expresses the spectral density @xmath21 of a given viscosity via the corresponding finite - temperature two - point euclidean correlation function of the energy - momentum tensor  @xcite , specifically @xmath22 for the shear viscosity and @xmath23 for the bulk viscosity . in particular , the fact that it is the trace anomaly @xmath24 , which is correlated in case of the bulk viscosity , explains in terms of the kubo formula why the bulk viscosity vanishes in any conformal field theory .",
    "below , we study a more realistic case of su(3 ) yang  mills theory . there",
    ", the energy - momentum tensor can receive contributions from the stochastic background fields and the so - called valence gluons .",
    "the low - energy nonperturbative stochastic background fields are characterized by the temperature - dependent chromomagnetic gluon condensate @xmath25 and the correlation length of the chromomagnetic vacuum , @xmath26 , that is the distance at which the two - point correlation function of the chromomagnetic fields exponentially falls off  @xcite .",
    "the valence gluons are higher in energy than the background fields , and are confined by these fields at large _",
    "separations  @xcite .",
    "this property of the valence gluons makes them different from the ordinary gluons of perturbation theory .",
    "such a two - component model of the gluon plasma was recently proven efficient ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) for the description of the pressure and the interaction measure , which had been simulated on the lattice in ref .",
    "@xcite , as well as for the calculation of the radiative energy loss of a highly energetic parton traversing the plasma  @xcite .",
    "it therefore looks natural to apply the same two - component model of the gluon plasma to a derivation of the shear and bulk viscosities by means of the kubo formulae .",
    "the first step in this direction was made in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a contribution of _ confining _ self - interactions of the stochastic background fields to the shear viscosity was found . besides those , lattice simulations  @xcite point to the existence of also _ nonconfining _ nonperturbative self - interactions of the background fields , whose strength amounts to 17% of the full strength of nonperturbative self - interactions . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the contribution to the shear viscosity produced by nonconfining nonperturbative self - interactions of the background fields , and show that it diminishes the contribution of confining self - interactions by 15% ( that is rather close to the above - mentioned 17% ) .",
    "we furthermore calculate for the first time the contributions of both confining and nonconfining nonperturbative self - interactions to the bulk viscosity of the gluon plasma .",
    "note that the kubo formulae lead to the following temperature dependence of the contributions of the background fields to the viscosities  @xcite : @xmath27 at temperatures above that of the dimensional reduction , @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 lies somewhere between @xmath20 and @xmath30  @xcite ) , one has @xmath31 , whereas the temperature dependence of the entropy density at @xmath32 is @xmath33 . therefore , at such rather high temperatures , one expects that the ratios to the entropy density of the contributions of the background fields to the two viscosities exhibit the same temperature behavior : @xmath34 in this paper , we prove that this is indeed the case , and explicitly calculate numerical coefficients in the formulae above .",

    "<S> the contributions of confining as well as nonconfining nonperturbative self - interactions of stochastic background fields to the shear and bulk viscosities of the gluon plasma in su(3 ) yang  mills theory are calculated . </S>",
    "<S> the nonconfining self - interactions change ( specifically , diminish ) the values of the shear and bulk viscosities by 15% , that is close to the 17% which the strength of the nonconfining self - interactions amounts of the full strength of nonperturbative self - interactions . the ratios to the entropy density of the obtained nonperturbative contributions to the shear and bulk viscosities are compared with the results of perturbation theory and the predictions of @xmath0 sym . </S>"
