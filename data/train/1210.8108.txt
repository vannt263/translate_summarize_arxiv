    "the renowned ryogo kubo once stated that `` statistical mechanics has been considered a theoretical endeavor .",
    "however , statistical mechanics exists for the sake of the real world , not for fictions .",
    "further progress can only be hoped by closed cooperation with experiment '' [ l ] .",
    "this is nowadays particularly relevant because the notable development of all the modern technology , fundamental for the progress and well being of the world society , poses a great deal of stress in the realm of basic physics , more precisely on thermo - statistics .",
    "thus , on the one hand , we do face situations in electronics and optoelectronics involving physical - chemical systems far - removed - from equilibrium , where ultrafast ( pico- and femto - second scale ) and non - linear processes are present .",
    "further , we need to be aware of the rapid unfolding of nano - technologies and use of low - dimensional systems ( e.g. , nanometric quantum wells and quantum dots in semiconductors heterostructures ) [ 2 ] . all together",
    "this demands having an access to a statistical mechanics being efficient to deal with such requirements . on the other hand",
    ", one needs to face the study of soft matter and fluids with complex structures ( usually of the average self - affine fractal - like type ) [ 3 ] .",
    "this is relevant for technological improvement in industries like , for example , that of polymers , petroleum , cosmetics , food , electronics and photonics ( conducting polymers and glasses ) , in medical engineering , etc .",
    "moreover , in both type of situations above mentioned there often appear difficulties of description and objectivity ( existence of so - called `` hidden constraints '' ) , which impair the proper application of the conventional ensemble approach used in the general , logically and physically sound , and well established boltzmann - gibbs statistics . a tentative to partially overcome such difficulties consists into resorting to non - conventional approaches [ 4 - 7 ] .",
    "since , as noticed , a most relevant objective of any nonequilibrium statistical theory is to provide a comprehension of the underlying physics related to the relaxation phenomena that can be evidenced in experiments , it needs be coupled with a response function theory .",
    "this is the subject of this paper , where we specifically resort to the use of a non - equilibrium statistical ensemble formalism ( nesef for short ) [ 8 - 11 ] ) .",
    "it can be noticed that nowadays two approaches appear to be the most favorable for providing very satisfactory methods to deal with systems within an ample scope of nonequilibrium conditions .",
    "they are , on the one hand , numerical simulation methods [ 12 ] , or computational physics .",
    "in particular , to it belongs non - equilibrium molecular - dynamics nmd [ 13 ] , a computational method created for modeling physical systems at the microscopic level , being a good technique to study the molecular behavior of several physical processes . on the other hand",
    ", we do have the kinetic theory based on the far - reaching generalization of gibbs ensemble formalism , the nesef [ 11,14 ] .",
    "the present structure of the formalism consists in an extension and generalization of earlier pioneering approaches , among which we can pinpoint the works of kirkwood [ 15 ] , green [ 16 ] , mori - oppenheim - ross [ 17 ] , mori [ 18 ] and zwanzig [ 19 ] .",
    "nesef has been approached from different points of view : some are based on heuristic arguments , others on projection - operator techniques ( the former following kirkwood and green and the latter following zwanzig and mori ) .",
    "the formalism has been systematized and largely improved by the russian school of statistical physics , which can be considered to have been initiated by the renowned nicolai nicolaievich bogoliubov ( e.g. , see ref .",
    "[ 20 ] ) and we may also name nicolai sergeievich krylov [ 21 ] , and more recent1y mainly through the relevant contributions of dimitrii zubarev [ 8,9 ] , sergei peletminskii [ 22 ] , and others .",
    "we present in refs .",
    "[ 11 ] a systematization , as well as generalizations and conceptual discussions , of the matter .",
    "it may be noticed that these different approaches to nesef can be brought together under a unique variational principle .",
    "this has been originally done by zubarev and kalashnikov [ 23 ] and later on reconsidered in refs . [",
    "it consists on the maximization , in the context of information theory , of gibbs statistical entropy ( that is , the average of minus the logarithm of the statistical distribution function [ 24,25 ] , which in communication theory is shannon informational entropy [ 26,27 ] , subjected to certain constraints and including non - locality in space , retro - effects , and irreversibility on the macroscopic level .    concerning response function theory , the usual theory to calculate linear responses to mechanical perturbations ( e.g. [ 28 - 33 ] ) is based on expansions in terms of correlation functions in equilibrium .",
    "as initial condition is taken that of equilibrium with a thermal reservoir , and next it is studied the evolution of the system as if it were isolated from all external influences except the driving field .",
    "let us now consider the situation when a mechanical perturbation is applied on an already far - from - equilibrium system , in which are unfolding irreversible processes which are describable in terms of equations of evolution for a basic set of macrovariables in the non - equilibrium thermodynamic space of states . since nesef provides a seemingly powerful method to obtain a description of the macrostate of such systems , it is appealing to derive a response function theory based on correlation functions in the unperturbed nonequilibrium state of the system .",
    "schemes of this type have been proposed [ 31 - 33 ] , and next we systematize and extend this treatment , in such a way to allow the treatment of experiments involving time - resolution ( including the ultrafast time scale of pico- and femto - seconds ) , and space resolution ( including those in the emerging nano - science and technology ) .    it is shown the connection of the observable properties with correlation functions out of equilibrium ; a generalized fluctuation - dissipation theorem  relating correlation functions and generalized susceptibilities  is derived , and the method , useful for calculations , of nonequilibrium - thermodynamic green functions is presented .",
    "this is done in sections ii , iii and iv , and in section v we present a scattering theory , in the same conditions , namely , including time and space resolution , for systems far - from equilibrium .",
    "the connection of the scattering theory with response function theory follows from application of the nonequilibrium fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "finally , in section vi we present a couple of illustrations showing the working of the theory in the study of two kind of experiments , namely optical responses in ultrafast laser spectroscopy of polar semiconductors , and raman scattering of electrons in doped iii - n semiconductors ( `` blue diodes '' ) in the presence of electric fields with moderate to high intensities . in the latter case",
    "the nonequilibrium fluctuation - dissipation theorem allows to connect the raman spectrum with nonlinear transport properties in these materials ( nonlinear and time - dependent conductivity and diffusion coefficient , and a generalized - nonlinear and time - dependent einstein - relation ) .",
    "we consider an open many - body system out of equilibrium , which is in contact with a set of reservoirs and under the action of pumping sources .",
    "we are essentially presenting the most general experiment one can think of , namely a sample ( the open system of interest composed of very - many degrees of freedom ) subjected to given experimental conditions , as it is diagrammatically described in fig . 1 .        in fig .",
    "1 , the sample is composed of a number of subsystems , @xmath0 , ( or better to say subdegrees of freedom , for example , in solid state matter those associated to electrons , lattice vibrations , excitons , impurity states , collective excitations as plasmons , magnons , etc . , hybrid excitations as polarons , polaritons , plasmaritons and so on ) . they interact among themselves via interaction potentials producing exchange at certain rates , @xmath1 , of energy and momentum . pumping sources act on the different subsystems of the sample",
    " via particular types of fields , electric , magnetic , electromagnetic , etc .",
    " well characterized when setting up the experiment , and there follows relaxation of the energy in excess of equilibrium the system is receiving to the external reservoirs , @xmath2 . finally , the experiment is performed coupling an external probing source , characterized in the figure by @xmath3 , with one or more subsystems of the sample , and some kind of response , say @xmath4 , is detected by a measuring apparatus ( e.g. ammeter , spectrometer , etc . ) .",
    "it needs be understood that the pumping sources exert their influence on the given open system through the fields they generate , say , magnetic , electric , electromagnetic as produced for example from a laser machine , and so on , or , eventually , in scattering experiments is the interaction potential with the particles of an incoming beam .",
    "let the hamiltonian be @xmath5 that is , the hamiltonian @xmath6 of the system in the presence of the fields of the pumping sources which drive it away from equilibrium , plus the interactions with the reservoirs , and with the field(s ) , @xmath7 , created by the external perturbing apparatus .",
    "we take for the latter the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the expression for the perturbing force ( @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a functional derivative ) and @xmath12 an observable of the system to which it is coupled .",
    "we recall that the system is in contact with ideal reservoirs , and the statistical operator is taken as a product of the one of the system @xmath13 times the stationary canonical distribution of the reservoirs @xmath14 , which we write @xmath15 [ 11 ] ( see appendix a ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath16 , introducing @xmath17 , where @xmath18 accounts for all the interactions in the system and @xmath19 for the interaction with the surroundings .",
    "schrdinger equation for this system , i.e. @xmath20 with the initial condition @xmath21 at time @xmath22 when the perturbation is switched on , has the formal solution @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the evolution operator satisfying that @xmath25 with @xmath26 ( the unit operator ) , and we recall that it is a unitary operator , that is @xmath27 .",
    "let us now introduce the interaction representation , writing @xmath28 where @xmath29 which is the evolution operator in the absence of the perturbation potential @xmath30 ; this means that we are separating the internal dynamics of the system from the dynamical effects of the perturbation which are accounted for by @xmath31 . introducing eq .",

    "let us add some additional considerations .",
    "first , if the system has translational invariance ( or near _ translational invariance _ as in the case of regular crystalline matter ) , the dependence of @xmath75 and @xmath87 on @xmath116 and @xmath117 is through the difference @xmath118 .",
    "we can then introduce the fourier transform in space , namely @xmath119 where @xmath120 . moreover , latexmath:[\\[\\lbrack",

    "similarly , it follows that @xmath122 what implies that @xmath123 on the other hand , on the basis of eqs .",
    "( 32 ) and ( 50 ) we have that @xmath124 which is then a real quantity , and also is @xmath84 .",
    "moreover , if the initial condition of preparation of the system is the one of equilibrium with the reservoirs , characterized by distribution @xmath125 ( which commutes with @xmath126 ) , we recover the usual expression [ 28 ] @xmath127\\,\\varrho _ { \\text{eq}}\\bigr\\}\\;.\\ ] ] where , as usual , because the equilibrium has been established , the interaction of system and reservoir is neglected .    secondly , as pointed out in the introduction the notable developments in instrumentation that are at present being accumulated , and which are necessary for the study of systems working in far - from - nonequilibrium conditions in the sought - after miniaturized devices with ultrafast responses of nowadays advanced technology , require the mechanical - statistical analysis in short time intervals ( as described above ) and in nanometric spatial regions .",
    "this is also contained in the theoretical treatment already described .",
    "in fact , if the property of the systems is measured in a small region around position @xmath116 , and also evolving in time , the expected value is given in eq .",

    "( 2 ) ] @xmath129 finally this nesef - based approach to response function theory involves , as seen above , the calculation of averages in terms of the nonequilibrium statistical operator , a quite difficult task .",
    "first we recall that , we have taken the system in contact with external reservoirs , the latter very much larger than the system , which , for all practical purposes , remain in a stationary state of equilibrium all along the realization of the experiments , and that @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the stationary equilibrium statistical operator of the reservoir(s ) , and @xmath132 the nonequilibrium statistical operator of the system .",
    "moreover , we can write [ 8 - 11 ] @xmath133 that is , the sum of the `` instantaneously - frozen '' auxiliary statistical operator @xmath134 and the contribution @xmath135 which accounts for the relaxation processes developing in the media .",
    "therefore , we can write eq . ( 25 ) as @xmath136 where in @xmath137 the averaging is over the auxiliary ensemble , characterized by @xmath134 , and @xmath138 is the averaging in terms of the contribution @xmath139 . using the expression for @xmath140 , given in terms of @xmath134",
    "[ 11 ] , it can be shown that it is expressed in a born - perturbation - like series in powers of @xmath141 , the internal interactions in the system .",
    "therefore , whereas the weak - coupling limit can be used , we can retain only @xmath142 to a good degree of approximation . in the nesef - based kinetic equations the use of such limit renders the equation markovian in character [ 14 ] .",
    "we stress again that the _ response function theory for systems away from equilibrium is always coupled with the kinetic equations that describe the evolution of the nonequilibrium thermodynamic state of the system_.    let us next see another important property of the nonequilibrium generalized susceptibility , namely a _ fluctuation - dissipation theorem in far - from - equilibrium conditions_.",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt )  originally a relation between the equilibrium fluctuations in a system and the dissipative response induced by external forces  provided a major impetus for the development of discussions of irreversible processes .",
    "a classical particular form seems to have been proved by nyquist [ 34 ] for the relationship between the thermal noise and the impedance of a resistor .",
    "derivation from phenomenological points of view followed , together with stochastic approaches , and finally entered into the domain of statistical mechanics [ 35,36 ] .",
    "we here extend kubo s approach in order to encompass arbitrary nonequilibrium conditions .",
    "as noticed those results involve the immediate neighborhood of the equilibrium , and were very well established . for systems out of equilibrium ( particularly those",
    "far from equilibrium ) the situation is not clearly delineated , and some approaches are available for steady - state conditions in a stochastic approach [ 37 ] and in transient regimes for particular ensembles [ 38 ] .",
    "we address here the derivation of a fdt for far - from - equilibrium systems , in the framework of the nonequilibrium ensemble formalism nesef , which is a generalization to arbitrary nonequilibrium conditions of the formalism developed by kubo [ 36 ] in the case of systems in equilibrium .",
    "a fluctuation - dissipation theorem for systems arbitrarily away from equilibrium , and in the formalism of nesef here presented , follows from the comparison of two expressions : one is a correlation function of two quantities and the other a dynamic response of the system to an external deterministic perturbation , that is , the generalized susceptibility of the previous section .",
