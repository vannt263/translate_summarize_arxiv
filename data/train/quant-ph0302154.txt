    "there is an increasing need for identifying the number of photons that is contained within a weak light pulse or time interval of a weak cw light field .",
    "a  device capable of photon - number resolution would contribute both to fundamental research in the area of quantum optics and to more - or - less practical quantum communication systems , such as quantum key distribution schemes @xcite .",
    "in the former case it would significantly help in the analysis and preparation of quantum states with prescribed statistics @xcite , in the latter it would prolong communication distances and increase the rate of secure communication @xcite . a detector capable to resolve the vacuum state , one - photon fock state and states containing more than one photon was recently constructed @xcite , but it requires operation under extreme conditions at present and it hardly becomes a common laboratory tool at least in near future .",
    "a similar problem occurs with a photon - number resolving detector @xcite based on superconducting transition - edge sensor microcalorimeter technology that needs mk temperatures for its operation .",
    "common detectors of weak light fields ( avalanche photodiodes and photomultipliers ) can not provide photon - number resolution but they have high quantum efficiencies in the visible @xcite and near infrared @xcite regions .",
    "the use of a cascade of such detectors behind a @xmath0 multiport @xcite then provides a device capable to resolve photon - numbers to some extent . assuming a lossless device , ideal detectors , and provided that the mean number of photons in the signal @xmath1 , a part of any multi - photon signal containing @xmath2 photons gets split with a high probability to the arms of the multiport in such a way that @xmath2 detections at different detectors occur .",
    "( we note that in the limit @xmath3 this probability is one . )",
    "however , it was shown in @xcite that the performance of such a device is severely inflicted by losses in the device and imperfections of the detectors . to achieve a reasonable performance ,",
    "large array of detectors with high quantum efficiency and low noise is required @xcite , so that such photon - number resolving device becomes unacceptably complex .",
    "the use of this photon - number resolving device in a source of one - photon fock states based on entangled photon pairs and postselection was analyzed in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that photon fields with the fano factor around 0.7 can be generated by this source under real conditions .",
    "a quantum - key distribution system using this source can have a secure communication distance up to 120  km and can provide higher values of gain @xcite .",
    "these results motivate the endeavour to simplify the above discussed photon - number resolving device .",
    "we note that also single - photon sources utilizing nv centers @xcite and quantum dots @xcite are perspective for quantum - key distribution systems . however , nv centers have low efficiencies of single - photon generation ( @xmath4 ) and quantum - dot sources have to be cooled to 5  k at present .    in this letter",
    "we propose and test a variant of such cascading device in which we replace the @xmath0 multiport and @xmath5 detectors with a fiber - loop delay line and a single avalanche - photodiode detector .",
    "this decreases the complexity as well as the cost of the device to a reasonable measure .",
    "a  similar device has been recently suggested also by other authors @xcite .",
    "the number of detectors @xmath5 is given by the number of time windows ( channels ) we detect using the time - of - flight spectrometer .",
    "we use a variable - ratio coupler at the entrance to the fiber - loop delay line so that we can control the distribution of probabilities of detection in the individual channels . in order to show the performance of this fiber - loop detection device",
    ", we theoretically determine and experimentally test the best setting of the device with respect to distinguishing multi - photon states ( containing two or more photons ) from the one - photon state and the vacuum state .",
    "the scheme of our device is plotted in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "quantum state to be analyzed is injected to port 1 of the single - mode variable ratio coupler ( sifam svr-82 , referred as svr hereafter ) .",
    "port 3 outputs to a detector module based on a silicon avalanche photodiode with active quenching ( perkin - elmer spcm - aq-141-fc ) .",
    "this detector yields ttl output upon incident photon with quantum efficiency @xmath6 of 60% ( at 830  nm , including coupling - optics losses ) and is not capable of resolving the number of incident photons .",
    "the dark count rate is about 40 counts per second .",
    "ports 2 and 4 are interconnected with 10  m long single - mode fiber thus forming a delay line longer than the dead time of the detector which is 50  ns .",
    "the outputs of the detector are registered as stop pulses in the time - of - flight spectrometer ( fast comtec tof7885 ) that is connected to a pc directly or through a multichannel buffer .",
    "start pulses for the time - of - flight spectrometer are generated by trigger pulses of the source of quantum states to be examined .    denoting the intensity transmission coefficients from port @xmath7 to port @xmath8 of the svr by @xmath9 , the device input coupling transmission by @xmath10 ( due to loss at the input connector ) , the svr transmission by @xmath11 ( due to svr excess loss ) , the total transmission of the fiber loop by @xmath12 and the transmission from port 3 of the svr to the detector including detector quantum efficiency by @xmath6",
    ", we arrive at the transmission coefficients @xmath13 for the detection channels : @xmath14 if a single photon enters the device , transmission coefficients give also the probabilities of photon detection .",
    "a  question arises , what is the optimum setting of the svr for the detection of multi - photon states .",
    "the highest probability to distinguish multi - photon states from the one - photon state and the vacuum state is achieved provided that the probabilities @xmath15 have the same value .",
    "the reason is that the energy in a detected photon field is equally distributed over all detectors and then the intensities of the photon fields in all detectors reach the lowest possible value .",
    "this case can be also distinguished by maximizing shannon entropy .",
    "we can not reach this best case with our fiber - loop detection device .",
    "best conditions from the point of view of photon - number resolution obtainable by our fiber - loop detection device can be found only numerically in principle .",
    "however , numerical calculations as well as experimental results indicated that the principle of maximization of shannon entropy is valid for this task and can provide these conditions ( see fig .",
    "we first simplify the real svr to an idealized unitary device setting @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "this idealized coupler can then be represented with a single variable - division - ratio parameter @xmath20 . upon replacing @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    "we get : @xmath23 assuming further @xmath24 in the ideal case , we can evaluate shannon entropy @xmath25 of the ideal channel detector as follows : @xmath26 this entropy is maximized for @xmath27 , i.e. , a balanced svr is optimal . in the more general case @xmath28",
    "the condition for maximum entropy needs to be evaluated numerically and it can be found that for realistic values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 the maximum value of entropy is decreased and the maximum occurs for @xmath31 .",
    "thus , in a real device we can expect best performance of the detector when svr is unbalanced in favor of port 4 .",
    "for the parameters of our device we get the maximum value of entropy at @xmath32 .",
    "for an experimental test of the detector we have fed it with a source of faint laser pulses with poissonian statistics and variable mean photon number .",
    "they have been obtained from a laser diode ( sharp lt015 ) yielding 4 ns pulses that have been subsequently attenuated by a digital variable attenuator ( oz optics da-100 ) to a single - photon level .    a  typical time spectrum measured by the time - of - flight spectrometer at the mean photon number @xmath33 ( see eq .",
    "( [ definition ] ) below for the definition of @xmath34 ) is shown in fig .",
    "multiple peaks can be resolved at time distances of about 60 ns .",
    "the background between the peaks is caused by afterpulses , i.e. false detections that occur after dead time of the detector .",
    "this is why they are not present between the first two peaks . in our detector ,",
    "the total afterpulse probability is of the order of @xmath35 .",
    "the envelope of the afterpulse probabilities coming from individual peaks then forms the background pattern visible in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . at low intensities",
    "the probability of detection due to an afterpulse is considerably lower so that the main source of noise are the dark counts of the detector whose probability is @xmath36 per 5 ns bin .",
    "it is important to know the losses in the device .",
    "the total transmission of the device may be evaluated using eqs .",
    "( [ probgena ] ) and ( [ probgenb ] ) as @xmath37.\\ ] ] the quantity @xmath38 can be measured directly and we have found @xmath39 . since @xmath6 is specified by the manufacturer of the detector , the total transmission @xmath40 of the device is known . however , upon inspecting eq .",
    "( [ total ] ) we can get more insight into the structure of the losses .    we have observed experimentally that the total transmission @xmath40 depends only weakly on the svr setting . we therefore again replace the four @xmath9 coefficients by a single parameter @xmath20 and arrive at a simplified expression @xmath41 since the dependence of @xmath40 on @xmath20 is weak , we may deduct that @xmath40 is given dominantly by the first term in eq .",
    "( [ totalsimp ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath11 was found in an independent measurement to be @xmath42 .",
    "the transmission of the fiber loop @xmath12 can be found from the measured values of the normalized channel probabilities @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) . in particular",
    ", the ratio @xmath45 evaluates to @xmath46 where only the first term of eq .",
    "( [ totalsimp ] ) has been used . from experimental results we find the value @xmath47 to be almost independent of @xmath20 and @xmath2 ( thus justifying the approximations used ) . from eq .",
    "( [ ratioh ] ) we then get @xmath48 ( 0.27  db ) . finally , the value of input coupling transmission @xmath10 is evaluated from eq .",
    "( [ totalsimp ] ) as @xmath49 ( 0.36 db ) .",
    "these values are rather low and are caused mainly by the wear - out of the connectors used in our laboratory setup .",
    "the application of new connectors or fused fibers would further improve the performance of the device .",
    "the division ratio of the svr is set by a micrometer screw .",
    "the distribution of detection probabilities to the first six channels based on the svr position is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . the small white area in the top part of the plot corresponds to the sum of the higher channels ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "we can see that various settings are possible .",
    "we can , e.g. , set the device to the regime of one dominant channel with other channels weak but a moderate number of them ( 5 or 6 ) nonnegligible ( their weight is above 1  % ; see positions 5 - 10 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , or to a different regime of fewer but relatively balanced channels ( see , e.g. , position 19 in fig .  [ fig3 ] where the first three channels are in the ratio 39%:42%:13% ) .",
    "let us now have a look at the capability to resolve multi - photon states using our device .",
    "we characterize the measured poissonian signal by the mean photon number @xmath34 . the mean photon number @xmath51 is obtained from the measured probability of detection @xmath52 assuming detection of the whole poissonian signal by the detector with efficiency @xmath40 , for which @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath54 our measured signal had @xmath34 equal to 4.26 photons per pulse . the probability of vacuum state detection @xmath55 , single - channel detection @xmath56 , and multichannel detection @xmath57 were extracted from the measured data . at each setting , the probabilities were obtained by detecting large number of laser pulses ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "we characterize the fraction of multi - photon states detected by our detector with another quantity , namely the multi - photon content @xmath59 , @xmath60 ( @xmath59 gives the probability that non - vacuum pulses contain more than 1 photon ) @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the detected multi - photon content @xmath61 at the mean photon number @xmath62 photons per pulse . for comparison ,",
    "a real ( theoretical ) multi - photon content @xmath61 in a poissonian laser pulse in front of the device is shown as well ( @xmath61 is not constant for different svr settings because the laser intensity slightly changed from one setting to another ) .",
    "the highest values of @xmath61 have been observed for svr positions 16 - 20 with maximum at position 17 .",
    "the value of @xmath61 grows with the number of channels considered . due to losses in the device and limited quantum efficiency of the detector ,",
    "the measured multi - photon content is lower than the real ( theoretical ) multi - photon content . nevertheless , the value of the measured multi - photon content was lower by less than 4  % in comparison with the value of the real ( theoretical ) multi - photon content at best performance of the device ( svr position 17 , 15 channels ) for this pulse - energy level .",
    "it is also worth noting that the use of a large number of channels is useful mainly in the regime with the first dominant channel while it brings only a little advantage in case of fewer but relatively balanced channels .",
    "values of entropy for each setting of the svr are also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and they clearly show that entropy of the multichannel detector is the right indication of the multi - photon - resolution capability . the optimum performance of the device is achieved close to the value @xmath63 as estimated theoretically in the preceding section .",
    "the performance of the detector in identification of the multi - photon content over a wide range of the mean photon number @xmath34 of the input poissonian state is shown in fig .  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the measured values of the multi - photon content @xmath61 ( black rectangles ) follow closely the ( dashed ) curve of the real ( theoretical ) multi - photon content of the input state .",
    "the ratio of the measured values of the multi - photon content @xmath61 to the real ( theoretical ) ones shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] determines the efficiency of identification of multi - photon states .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] that the ratio exceeds 60% for weak coherent states and reaches almost unity for strong coherent states .",
    "reduction of the multi - photon content @xmath64 of a beam can be reached in the following scheme .",
    "a source provides perfectly correlated photon pairs ( e.g. , such pairs are generated by spontaneous parametric downconversion ) .",
    "one of the correlated beams is postselected by the measurement on the other beam using our fiber - loop detection device .",
    "postselection process provides a beam with lower values of the multi - photon content @xmath65 .",
    "the ratio @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) then determines efficiency of this reduction . the dependence of the ratio @xmath66 on the mean photon number @xmath34 in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows that the value of the ratio @xmath66 can be reduced down to 40  % for input poissonian states with @xmath68 .",
    "the most interesting input states for applications utilizing multi - photon reduction are those containing a more - or - less balanced mixture of vacuum , single - photon and multi - photon contributions .",
    "the reason is that weak poissonian states contain only a small fraction of multi - photon states ( e.g. , @xmath69 for @xmath70 ) whereas the fraction of a one - photon state is practically negligible in strong coherent states .",
    "the reduction down to 40  % can be ideally reached for such states .",
    "we note that a real source would be characterized by higher values of the ratio @xmath66 due to imperfect coupling of photons in a pair @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that in fact our measured value of the multi - photon content is slightly influenced by the noises in the device .",
    "the noise counts may cause multichannel detection even when only a single photon from the laser pulse has been detected .",
    "it is difficult to determine exactly the contribution of these false multi - detections .",
    "however , it is possible to estimate the upper limit of false detections due to afterpulses as @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is a duty factor of the detector channels at the time - of - flight spectrometer ( i.e. , the ratio of the channel time window to the time distance between channels ; @xmath73 in our case ) . then the contribution to the multi - photon content due to afterpulses @xmath74 .",
    "for very weak pulse energies false multiple detections might rather stem from dark counts of the detector .",
    "nevertheless , the latter would become notable only at mean - photon - number levels below @xmath75 photon per pulse .",
    "therefore , the influence of noises is negligible in our device .",
    "the analyzed device might help in the preparation of photon - number - squeezed states by postselection from entangled photon pairs obtained by spontaneous parametric downconversion @xcite .",
    "vacuum states can easily be filtered out similarly to the case of postselection with a single detector @xcite and the fraction of multi - photon states can be significantly reduced using multichannel detection .",
    "the obtained states are potentially useful , e.g. , for quantum - key distribution systems .",
    "our device is a cheap , though not better as for the performance , alternative to the cascading detector @xcite for this purpose .",
    "other devices like those based on nv centers , quantum dots or using detectors with a superconducting microcalorimeter are quite demanding even for a common laboratory practice , at least at present .    in this work",
    "we use only the information whether single or multiple detections occurred regardless of the information in which channels the photons were detected .",
    "since the channels exhibit different detection probabilities , there is an additional information which might be used . in general",
    ", it is possible to obtain the photon - number statistics of a detected quantum state to some extent .",
    "this is a topic of a forthcoming publication .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have built a configurable multichannel detector using a single avalanche photodiode .",
    "we have characterized the best regimes for its operation as multi - photon resolving detector .",
    "our analysis shows , that this device can efficiently distinguish multi - photon states from the one - photon state and the vacuum state over a wide range of energies of the input state .",
