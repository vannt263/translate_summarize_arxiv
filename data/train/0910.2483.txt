    "topological order in the quantum hall liquids is currently the subject of intense interest because of the possiblity of detecting , for the first time , excitations that exhibit non - abelian statistics.@xcite on the theoretical side , a primary issue is how to go beyond some of the known examples of non - abelian fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) states and to construct and understand more general non - abelian fqh phases .    from the very beginning",
    ", two ways to construct and understand non - abelian fqh states have been developed.@xcite one is through the use of ideal wave functions and ideal hamiltonians.@xcite the physical properties of the constructed fqh states can be deduced using conformal field theory ( cft ) .",
    "the other is the projective construction,@xcite which allows us to derive the bulk effective theory and edge effective theory for the constructed fqh states .",
    "the physical properties of the fqh states can be derived from those effective theories .",
    "the @xmath0 parafermion states at filling fraction @xmath1 were first studied using the ideal - wavefunction / ideal - hamiltonian approach.@xcite what is the bulk effective theory for such @xmath0 parafermion states ?",
    "when @xmath3 , the edge states of the @xmath4 @xmath0 parafermion state are described by the @xmath5 kac - moody ( km ) algebra . using the correspondence between cft and chern - simons ( cs )",
    "theory,@xcite it was suggested that the bulk effective theory for the @xmath6 @xmath0 parafermion state is the @xmath5 cs theory.@xcite the guessed @xmath5 cs theory correctly reproduces the @xmath7-fold degeneracy for the @xmath8 @xmath0 parafermion state on a torus .",
    "however , the @xmath5 cs theory has a serious flaw .",
    "the @xmath9 charges in the @xmath5 km algebra for the edge states are physical quantum numbers that can be coupled to external probes , while the @xmath9 charges in the @xmath5 cs theory are unphysical and can not be coupled to external probes without breaking the @xmath9 gauge symmetry .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath9 in the edge @xmath5 km algebra is not related to the @xmath9 in the bulk @xmath5 cs theory .",
    "this leads us to wonder that the cft / cs - theory correspondence may not be the right way to derive the bulk effective theory for generic non - abelian states .",
    "in fact , when @xmath10 , the edge states for the @xmath1 @xmath0 parafermion state are described by @xmath11 cft , where the @xmath0 cft denotes the @xmath0 parafermion cft@xcite and @xmath12.@xcite it is not clear what is the corresponding bulk effective theory .",
    "note that the @xmath0 parafermion cft can be obtained from the coset construction of the @xmath13 km algebra.@xcite this suggests that the bulk effective theory may be a @xmath14 cs theory.@xcite but a naive treatment of such a cs theory gives rise to @xmath15 integer number of degenerate ground states on a torus , which does not agree with the ground state degeneracy for the @xmath16 @xmath0 parafermion state .",
    "we see that the bulk effective theory for a generic parafermion state is still an unresolved issue .    in this paper",
    ", we show how the projective construction@xcite can be applied to the @xmath0 parafermion ( read - rezayi ) states .",
    "this leads to a simplified understanding of the @xmath0 parafermion states in terms of the integer quantum hall ( iqh ) states and a different way of computing their topological properties .",
    "we find the bulk effective theory for the @xmath1 @xmath0 parafermion state to be the @xmath17_1 $ ] cs theory ( with a certain choice of electron operators and fermionic cores for certain quasiparticles ) .",
    "such a cs theory correctly reproduces the ground state degeneracy on a torus .",
    "the projective construction was explained in detail in . the idea is to rewrite the electron operator in terms of new fermionic degrees of freedom : @xmath18 there are @xmath19 flavors of fermion fields , @xmath20 , for @xmath21 , which carry electromagnetic charge @xmath22 , respectively , and which are called `` partons . ''",
    "the @xmath23 are constant coefficients and the sum of the charges of the partons is equal to the charge of the electron , which we set to 1 : @xmath24 .",
    "the electron operator @xmath25 can be viewed as the singlet of a group @xmath26 , which is the group of transformations on the partons that keeps the electron operator invariant .",
    "the theory in terms of electrons can be rewritten in terms of a theory of partons , provided that we find a way to project the newly enlarged hilbert space onto the physical hilbert space , which is generated by electron operators .",
    "we can implement this projection at the lagrangian level by introducing a gauge field , with gauge group @xmath26 , which couples to the current and density of the partons .",
    "we can therefore write the lagrangian as @xmath27 here , @xmath28 , @xmath29 is a gauge field in the @xmath30 matrix representation of the group @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath31 is the external electromagnetic gauge field and @xmath32 is an @xmath30 matrix with the electromagnetic charge of each of the partons along the diagonal .",
    "the @xmath33 respresent additional interaction terms between the partons and @xmath34 .",
    "( [ partonl ] ) is simply a convenient rewriting of the theory for the original electron system in terms of a different set of fluctuating fields .",
    "now we assume that there exists some choice of microscopic interaction parameters for which the interaction between the partons is such that the low energy fluctuations of the @xmath35 gauge field are weak after integrating out the partons .",
    "this means that the gauge theory that results from integrating out the partons can be treated perturbatively about its free gaussian fixed point . since the partons in the absence of the gauge field form a gapped state @xmath36 and",
    "since we can treat the gauge field perturbatively , the ground state remains to be gapped even after we include the gauge fluctuations .",
    "the ground state wave function is , at least for large separations , @xmath37 , of the form @xmath38 if we assume that the @xmath39th parton forms a @xmath40 integer quantum hall state , the partons will be gapped and can be integrated out to obtain an effective action solely in terms of the gauge field .",
    "the action that we obtain is a cs action with gauge group @xmath26 , which should be expected given that for a system that breaks parity and time - reversal , the cs term is the most relevant term in the lagrangian at long wavelengths .",
    "if we ignore the topological properties of the parton iqh states , then integrating out the partons will yield @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 and the @xmath33 represents higher order terms .",
    "however , since the partons do not form a trivial gapped state , but rather a topologically non - trivial one , eqn .",
    "( [ la1 ] ) can only describe ground state properties of the phase .",
    "it can be expected to reproduce the correct result for the ground state degeneracy on genus @xmath43 surfaces , for instance , and the correct fusion rules for the non - abelian excitations , but it can not be expected to produce all of the correct quantum numbers for the quasiparticle excitations , such as the quasiparticle spin , unless the partons are treated more carefully . this can be done in two ways .",
    "one way is to not integrate out the partons and to use ( [ partonl ] ) , taking into account a chern - simons term for @xmath35 that emerges as we renormalize to low energies .",
    "as will be discussed in more detail in section [ qps ] , the quasiparticles will correspond to holes in the parton iqh states which become non - abelian as a result of the coupling to the non - abelian chern - simons gauge field .",
    "the other way is to use the pure gauge theory in ( [ la1 ] ) and to put in by hand a fermionic core for quasiparticles that lie in certain `` odd '' representations of @xmath26 .",
    "some quasiparticles correspond to an odd number of holes in the parton iqh states and the fermionic character of these odd number of holes should be taken into account .",
    "let us now turn to the edge theory . before the introduction of the gauge field , the edge theory is the edge theory for @xmath19 free fermions forming an integer quantum hall state .",
    "if each parton forms a @xmath44 iqh state , then the edge theory would be a cft describing @xmath19 chiral free fermions , which we will denote as @xmath45 .",
    "after projection , the edge theory is described by a @xmath46 coset theory that we will understand in some more detail when we specialize to the @xmath0 parafermion states .    to be more precise",
    ", the edge theory should be understood in the following way .",
    "the electron creation and annihilation operators , @xmath25 and @xmath47 , generate an operator algebra that we refer to as the electron operator algebra .",
    "such electron operator algebra can be embedded in the @xmath46 coset theory .",
    "the topologically distinct quasiparticles are then labelled by different representations of this electron operator algebra . in some cases ,",
    "the electron operator algebra coincides with some well - known algebra . for the bosonic @xmath0 parafermion states at @xmath6 , for instance",
    ", the electron operator algebra is the same as the @xmath5 km algebra , for which the representation theory is well - known .",
    "now let us apply the projective construction to obtain the @xmath0 parafermion states .",
    "a crucial result for the projective construction is that the @xmath40 fqh wave function coincides with the correlation function of free fermions in a 1 + 1d cft : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a free complex chiral fermion , and @xmath50 is the fermion current .",
    "the operator product expansions for @xmath49 satisfy @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "( [ v1corr ] ) implies that the wave function ( [ wfn ] ) can also be expressed as a correlation function in a 1 + 1d cft:@xcite @xmath53 where the partons @xmath54 are now interpreted as free fermions in a 1 + 1d cft .",
    "the @xmath0 parafermion fqh wave functions are constructed as correlation functions of a certain cft : @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57 is a simple - current operator in the @xmath0 parafermion cft of zamalodchikov and fateev@xcite and @xmath58 is a free scalar boson .",
    "these wave functions exist for @xmath59 ; for @xmath60 , the electron operator @xmath61 and @xmath62 generate the @xmath5 km algebra : @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "this means that any electron operator that satisfies the @xmath5 current algebra will yield the same wave function .",
    "the crucial result for the projective construction approach to the @xmath0 parafermion states is that if we take the electron operator to be @xmath66 then it is easy to verify that @xmath67 and @xmath68 also satisfy the @xmath5 current algebra and therefore the wave function ( [ wfncorrel ] ) is the @xmath0 parafermion wave function .",
    "it follows that the @xmath0 parafermion states at @xmath69 , for general @xmath70 , are reproduced in the projective construction for the following choice of electron operator @xmath71 because including the additional operators @xmath72 , each of which is in a @xmath40 iqh state , has the effect of multiplying @xmath73 by the jastrow factor @xmath74 .    in the case",
    "@xmath60 , the electron operator can be written as @xmath75 , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath78 is the @xmath79 identity matrix .",
    "the group of transformations on the partons that leaves the electron operator invariant is simply the group of @xmath80 matrices that keeps invariant the antisymmetric matrix @xmath31 . in this case",
    ", this group is the fundamental representation of @xmath81 .",
    "note that @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "thus , we expect the edge theory to be @xmath84 , and the bulk cs theory to be @xmath85 , as described in the previous section .",
    "for general @xmath70 , the edge theory becomes @xmath86_1 $ ] and the bulk effective theory is a @xmath17_1 $ ] chern - simons theory .",
    "as a first check that this cs theory reproduces the correct topological properties of the @xmath0 parafermion states , we calculate the ground state degeneracy on a torus . this can be done explicitly using the methods of ; for @xmath60 , the result is @xmath87 , which coincides with the torus degeneracy of the @xmath60 @xmath0 parafermion states . in appendix [ gsdeg ]",
    "we outline in more detail the calculation in the case @xmath88 , for which we find the ground state degeneracy on a torus to be @xmath89 , which also agrees with known results for the @xmath0 parafermion states .",
    "the case @xmath88 reveals a crucial point . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath90_1 $ ] cs theory .",
    "naively , we would think that the extra @xmath91 part is trivial and does not contribute to the ground state degeneracy or the fusion rules , and again we might expect a ground state degeneracy of @xmath87 , but this is incorrect .",
    "the reason for this is that usually when we specify the gauge group and the level for cs theory , there is a standard interpretation of what the large gauge transformations are on higher genus surfaces , but this standard prescription may be inapplicable .",
    "instead , the large gauge transformations are specified by the choice of electron operator . in particular , for odd @xmath92 , the extra factor",
    "@xmath93 is half - integer , which highlights the fact that the @xmath94 and @xmath81 parts are married together in a non - trivial way .    in the @xmath60 case , the standard interpretation of the allowed gauge transformations for the @xmath95 cs theory is correct , and we can follow the standard prescription for deriving topological properties of cs theories at level @xmath92 with a simple lie group @xmath26 . in these cases ,",
    "the ground state degeneracy is given by the number of integrable representations of the affine lie algebra @xmath96 , where @xmath43 is the lie algebra of @xmath26 .",
    "the quasiparticles are in one - to - one correspondence with the integrable representations of @xmath96 , and their fusion rules are identical as well . in the case of the @xmath60 @xmath0 parafermion states , it is already known that the different quasiparticles correspond to the different integrable representations of the @xmath5 km algebra , and the fusion rules are the same as the fusion rules of the @xmath5 representations .",
    "in fact , @xmath95 and @xmath5 have the same number of primary fields and the same fusion rules , and so the @xmath95 cs theory has the same fusion rules as the @xmath0 parafermion states and the same ground state degeneracies on high genus riemann surfaces .",
    "the equivalence of the fusion rules for the representations @xmath95 and @xmath5 current algebra is a special case of a more general `` level - rank '' duality between @xmath97 and @xmath98,@xcite and is also related to the fact that the edge theory for the @xmath60 @xmath0 parafermion states can be described either by the @xmath84 coset theory or , equivalently , by the @xmath5 wess - zumino - witten model . for a more detailed discussion ,",
    "see appendix [ lrd ] .",
    "we can understand the non - abelian quasiparticles of the @xmath0 fqh states as holes in the parton integer quantum hall states .",
    "parafermion quasihole wave functions can be obtained by symmetrizing or anti - symmetrizing the quasihole wave functions of a generalized ( 331 ) state . ] after projection , these holes become the non - abelian quasiparticles and we can analyze these quasiparticles using either the bulk cs theory or through the edge theory / bulk wave function , all of which we obtained from the projective construction .",
    "the easiest way to analyze the quasiparticles is through the latter approach , which we describe first .",
    "the fundamental quasihole is the one with a single hole in one of the parton iqh states .",
    "we expect the wave function for this excited state to be , as a function of the quasiparticle coordinate @xmath99 and the electron coordinates @xmath100 , @xmath101 more general quasiparticles should be related to operators of the form @xmath102 . to see whether these operators really correspond to the non - abelian quasiparticles of the @xmath0 parafermion states , we can study their pattern of zeros.@xcite the pattern of zeros is a quantitative characterization of quasiparticles in the fqh states . in general , it may not be a complete one - to - one labelling of the quasiparticles , but in the case of the @xmath0 parafermion states , it is ; one way to see this from the projective construction approach is to compute the ground state degeneracy on the torus from the projective construction , which yields the number of topologically distinct quasiparticles , and then to observe that the number of operators with distinct pattern of zeros is the same as the number of distinct quasiparticles .",
    "the pattern of zeros @xmath103 is defined as follows.@xcite let @xmath104 denote the quasiparticle operator , and let @xmath105 .",

    "we see that they coincide exactly with the known quasiparticle pattern of zeros in the @xmath0 parafermion states , indicating that these operators do indeed correspond to the quasiparticle operators of the @xmath0 parafermion states .",

    "evidence for the equivalence of these two theories can be easily established by noting that they both have the same central charge , @xmath220 , and that the lie algebra @xmath221 can be embedded into the symmetry group of the free fermion theory , @xmath222.@xcite the possibility of this embedding implies that we can construct currents , @xmath223 where the @xmath224 are majorana fermions , which are related to the complex fermions as @xmath225 . @xmath226 and @xmath227 are mutually commuting sets of @xmath228 skew - symmetric matrices that lie in the lie algebra of @xmath229 and that separately generate the @xmath81 and @xmath230 lie algebras , respectively .",
    "these currents satisfy the @xmath219 current algebra , as can be seen by computing the opes : @xmath231 to compute the levels @xmath19 and @xmath92 , we have normalized the generators in the conventional way , so that the quadratic casimir in the adjoint representation is twice the dual coxeter number of the corresponding lie algebra .",
    "the stress - energy tensor for the @xmath232 theory , defined as @xmath233 therefore satisfies the same algebra as the stress - energy tensor of the free fermion theory : @xmath234 .",
    "thus , for the @xmath84 edge theory of the @xmath60 @xmath0 parafermion states , we can take the stress tensor to be : @xmath235 we can use this stress tensor to compute the scaling dimensions of the quasiparticle operators in the edge theory ."
