    "the use of hydrogen as an environmentally clean and efficient fuel for mobile applications is a very active research area .",
    "but , before a future hydrogen economy can become reality , several crucial challenges need to be addressed , mostly concerning the storage of hydrogen itself @xcite .",
    "the most important challenges for practical hydrogen - storage system are : ( i ) high gravimetric and volumetric storage density ( fuel tanks should be light and small ) ; ( ii ) good thermodynamics ( the hydrogen adsorption / desorption should occur at a reasonable pressure and temperature ) ; and ( iii ) fast reaction kinetics ( tank emptying and refilling should be fast ) . according to the department of energy , addressing these key elements through fundamental research is imperative to achieving a practical hydrogen economy @xcite . in this paper we present results that address the gravimetric and volumetric storage density .",
    "a wide variety of materials have been considered as possible hydrogen - storage materials @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a graphical representation of how many articles have been written on the subject ) .",
    "however , amongst all these materials , ( h@xmath0)@xmath1ch@xmath1or for short h4m  shows exceptional promise @xcite ; the h4 m system is extremely rich in molecular hydrogen , containing 33.3 mass% molecular hydrogen , not counting the atomic hydrogen in ch@xmath1 ; including it , we reach even 50.2  mass% .",
    "simply said , h4 m holds more hydrogen per mass and volume than any known material except pure hydrogen itself !",
    "unfortunately , h4 m is not stable under ambient pressure and temperature .",
    "the stability field is reported from approximately 5.8  gpa at room temperature to 10  k for ambient pressure @xcite , and it has been shown that moderate cooling can reduce the required pressure significantly @xcite .",
    "this fact led us to design a novel host+h4 m structure in which the host material provides the necessary pressure for h4 m to be stable , without the need for excessive cooling .",
    "the use of a host material will lower the exceptional volumetric and gravimetric hydrogen storage density of h4m  it is the main goal of this paper to quantify the tradeoff between lower storage density and stability at closer - to - ambient temperature and explore if it is worth pursuing .",
    "since h4 m is stable at room temperature under a pressure of 5.8  gpa , we are most interested in this region of the phase diagram and throughout the manuscript we report results at that pressure .",
    "we first consider h4 m in nanoporous metal organic framework ( mof ) materials @xcite , which provide significant pressure inside their cavities to stabilize h4 m .",
    "we study mofs that are isoreticular to ( i.e.  have the same network topology as ) mof-5 , with varying linker length .",
    "we find that these mofs all provide enough pressure to significantly decrease the burden of cooling , but none of them stabilize h4 m at room temperature .",
    "as a second host material , we consider single - wall carbon nanotubes ( cnt)@xcite , which are well known for being able to provide high pressure inside their cavities .",
    "specifically , we study zigzag nanotubes with chirality from ( 10,0 ) to ( 26,0 ) and corresponding radii from 4    to 10    while larger nanotubes with a radius up to several nanometers can be produced in experiments @xcite , such systems together with h4 m filling inside are , at the moment , not accessible through _ ab initio _ simulations .",
    "our calculations show that crystalline h4 m may be stabilized at room temperature inside nanotubes , opening the door for high - efficiency hydrogen - storage applications .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : after presenting computational details in section [ sec : comp ] , we show results for the structure of h4 m in its molecular and crystalline form in section [ sec : structure ] .",
    "results for h4 m inside the cavities of mofs and nanotubes are presented in section [ sec : h4m_in_mof ] and [ sec : h4m_in_cnt ] , respectively .",
    "we conclude and suggest future research in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "h4 m is classified as a van der waals compound @xcite .",
    "the study of nanotube interactions @xcite and binding of small molecules in mofs @xcite is also strongly determined by van der waals interactions . as such",
    ", an accurate description of van der waals interactions in these systems is crucial .",
    "thus , we use the recently developed van der waals density functional ( vdw - df ) , a truly nonlocal exchange and correlation functional , that incorporates van der waals forces self - consistently and seamlessly into dft @xcite . the vdw - df approach has shown good transferability for a range of van der waals systems reaching from simple dimers @xcite and physisorbed molecules @xcite to dna @xcite and drug design @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been applied successfully to answer questions regarding hydrogen storage @xcite , mofs @xcite , and nanotubes @xcite .    for our calculations we use density functional theory , as implemented in the pwscf code , which is part of the quantum - espresso package @xcite .",
    "we utilize ultrasoft pseudopotentials with a wave - function cutoff of 475  ev ( 5700  ev charge - density cutoff ) for carbon nanotube related systems and 475  ev ( 3800  ev charge - density cutoff ) for all other cases",
    ". a self - consistency convergence criterion of at least 1.4 @xmath2 10@xmath3  ev is used .",
    "all structures are relaxed until all force components are less than 2.5 mev /  . due to the limitation of calculation size , and the fact that larger mofs provide less pressure anyway ,",
    "only the smallest mof structures are investigated , using a @xmath4 monkhorst - pack * k*-mesh @xcite . for simulations of crystalline",
    "m itself , we use a @xmath5 * k*-mesh . all carbon nanotube related systems",
    "are simulated as infinitely long hexagonal nanotube arrays with varying radius / distance , comprised of a short unit cell length in @xmath6-direction , using a @xmath7 * k*-mesh .",
    "single molecule calculations on h4 m molecules are performed in a @xmath8 @xmath9 cubic unit cell .",
    "although h4 m under pressure has been investigated by x - ray diffraction @xcite , the actual microscopic structure of crystalline h4 m remains unknown @xcite .",
    "the x - ray diffraction experiments suggest a body - centered tetragonal structure @xcite and raman experiments provide further constraints @xcite . here , starting from these experimental guidelines , we report results for _ ab initio _ calculations of the molecular and crystalline h4 m structure .",
    "we use a bottom - up approach , where we first find the optimal structure for h4 m molecules , which we then assemble to form solids with various symmetries .",
    "we start by investigating the structure of a single h4 m molecule . after relaxing the molecule , starting from a variety of initial positions",
    ", we always find the same optimal structure : the molecule forms two tetrahedra , sharing the same center with opposite directions .",
    "the common center is the carbon atom of the methane molecule , which forms the small tetrahedron .",
    "the four hydrogen molecules form a larger tetrahedron , each of them located on one of the vertexes , and oriented so that they point to the central carbon atom of the methane .",
    "we find the c  h bond of the methane molecule to be 1.091   , the h ",
    "h bond of the hydrogen molecules to be 0.742   , and the distance from the central carbon atom to the closer hydrogen atom of the hydrogen molecules to be 3.295   .",
    "the optimized structure of the h4 m molecule is depicted in .",
    "optimized structure of a single h4 m molecule ( h@xmath0)@xmath1ch@xmath1 .",
    "the methane molecule forms a small tetrahedra , which sits inside a large tetrahedra formed by the hydrogen molecules .",
    "the axes of all hydrogen molecules point toward the centers of faces of the methane tetrahedra . ]    in , we list the binding energy as a function of the number of h@xmath0 molecules bound to the central ch@xmath1 molecule . here , the binding energy is defined as @xmath10 - e[{\\rm ch}_4 ] - n\\,e[{\\rm h}_2]$ ] for the case of @xmath11 h@xmath0 molecules bound to the ch@xmath1 molecule .",
    "we can see that an increase in the number of h@xmath0 molecules leads to an increase in binding energy per h@xmath0 molecule , due to the additional interaction of h@xmath0 molecules .",
    "we also report the incremental absorption energy , i.e.  the work to absorb each new h@xmath0 molecule .",
    "the increasing magnitude in both columns validates the stability of the h4 m molecule .",

    "since this molecule is small enough , we can compare here with the highest level of quantum chemistry .",
    "to this end , we have calculated the binding energy of four h@xmath0 molecules to methane  i.e .",
    "the last row of using various approaches and exchange - correlation functionals . as reference",
    ", we use mp2 and ccsd(t ) calculations , using the aug - cc - pvdz basis set with counterpoise corrections . for the binding energy",
    "we find 85.93  mev with mp2 and 87.75  mev with ccsd(t ) .",
    "these reference numbers are now to be compared with dft calculations . using standard lda @xcite",
    ", we find a very strong erroneous overbinding of 194.37  mev , not untypical when applying lda to small molecules with van der waals binding @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", a standard pbe @xcite calculation gives a large erroneous underbinding of only 36.65  mev . from these results",
    "it is clear that a simple h4 m molecule is a very delicate system that is very much influenced by van der waals interactions and thus an ideal application for vdw - df .",
    "the corresponding binding energy with vdw - df is 81.36  mev , in almost perfect agreement with high - level quantum chemistry .",
    "these results show that standard functionals such as lda and pbe are not suited to describe the binding of h4 m itself and much less so to study the h4 m crystal structure or its properties inside mofs and nanotubes ; thus , in the following we will only report results for vdw - df .    also worth mentioning at this point",
    "is that vdw - df is responsible for a small but significant charge transfer ; in fact , it seems that vdw - df is self - consistently rearranging the charge density just right , resulting in the excellent binding energy .",
    "such charge transfers caused by vdw - df are typically very small , i.e.  on the order of 10@xmath14 electrons / @xmath9 , where electronic charge gets accumulated between the constituents . a nice presentation of this charge transfer due to van der waals binding is given in figure  8 of ref .",
    "@xcite .      to find the true crystalline structure for h4",
    "m is a complicated task . in principle",
    ", one should use an approach such as the _ ab initio _ random structure search ( airss ) algorithm @xcite  which generates random structures biased on chemistry , experimental , and symmetry grounds  to sample the corresponding large phase space . here , however , we make use of experimentally suggested symmetries @xcite and an already existing semiclassical sampling of a large number of possible configurations @xcite .",
    "after somayazulu et al",
    ".  suggested a body - centered tetragonal ( bct ) structure ( with some uncertainty ) based on x - ray diffraction patterns @xcite , research on the precise structure of crystalline h4 m seems to have subsided .",
    "fifteen years later , mao et al .  found a simple orthorhombic unit cell for crystalline h4 m from a combined semiclassical / dft approach by randomly arranging atoms , which resulted in a good agreement between calculated and experimental xrd spectra @xcite .",
    "they found an optimized unit cell of 332  @xmath9 with four h4 m molecules , resulting in a molecular hydrogen volumetric density of 0.16  kg h@xmath0/l , in disagreement with their previously published number , which is almost twice as large @xcite  which we thus believe to be an error .",
    "using the above information as starting point , we generate seven closely related possible unit cells with an h4 m molecule as a building block ( using the molecular structure described above ) , i.e.simple/body-centered/face-centered cubic ( sc / bcc / fcc ) , simple / body - centered / face - centered orthorhombic ( so / bco / fco ) , and body - centered tetragonal ( bct ) .",
    "for all seven structures , we internally ( atom positions ) and externally ( unit cell parameters ) optimize the unit cells and determine the optimal ratios between the lengths of their edges ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) without pressure ; the corresponding results are listed in .",
    "then , we add hydrostatic pressure by changing the cell parameter @xmath17 , while keeping @xmath15 and @xmath16 constant , and relaxing the atom positions again for each volume . applying the exact conditions of hydrostatic pressure",
    "requires knowledge of all corresponding elastic constants , but test calculations show that h4 m is close to isotropic , such that the uniform scaling of all lattice constants is a good approximation and c@xmath18 differ only by a few percent , while c@xmath18 differs by about 10% .",
    "the numbers are similar for other symmetries . ] .",
    "the resulting energy versus volume curves are fitted using a murnaghan equation of state , enabling us to analyze the structures and their pressure dependence in detail ; results are shown in . as can be seen , the bco and bct curves are very close to each other due to the similarity of their structures , and they have the lowest energies at zero pressure .",
    "however , as the pressure increases , they cross with the so curve , indicating a pseudo - phase transformation at around 1.8  gpa . at 5.8 gpa  the pressure at which h4 m is experimentally stable at room temperature  so has the smallest volume and slightly higher energy than bco / bct . since at zero temperature",
    "the condition for the stable structure at constant pressure is that enthalpy ( @xmath19 ) be minimum @xcite , we conclude that the so structure is favored at 5.8  gpa , in agreement with mao et al .",

    "mofs can have very large unit cells with hundreds of atoms , which  together with hundreds of atoms from the h4 m filling  can quickly render _ ab initio _ calculations impractical . in order to still be able to make quantitative statements , we begin by investigating empty mofs and the pressure they can create in their cavities . with the knowledge gained about mof strength , we estimate their performance when filled with h4 m .",
    "we verify the results with one full _ ab initio _",
    "calculation on a small , but complete system of mof+h4 m .",
    "first , we investigate the strength of the bond between the zn  o  c cluster corners and the connected benzene linker .",

    "the force is then calculated by the energy derivative and is plotted in the middle panel of . from this , we can estimate the possible pressure that mof-5 can create , as the pressure is the ratio between the force and the area of the square in the cubic unit cell .",

    "the free and fixed diameter ( see for a definition of these terms ) of the pores in mof-5 have been reported as 11.2    and 18.6   , respectively @xcite .",
    "since the diagonal length of our calculated so h4 m structure at 5.8  gpa is 7.7   , we insert a @xmath4 compressed h4 m supercell into the pores of mof-5 .",
    "the mof-5 structure itself has 424 atoms ; fully filled with the h4 m supercell , this corresponds to more than 1000 atoms .",
    "since this is computationally too demanding , we only fill one pore ( out of eight ) per unit cell , resulting in a 528 atom unit cell .",

    "calculations on this system and find that the unit cell experiences a pressure of 3.9  gpa ( the fact that this number is the same as the corresponding maximum pressure in is accidental . ) this pressure is lower than the 5.8  gpa compacted h4 m supercell that inserted , simply because the cavity is slightly larger than the h4 m supercell . when we further let all atoms relax again in this structure , we find that the unit cell stabilizes at approximately 1  gpa . note that , upon relaxation , we find only minimal changes in the atoms positions of both the mof and the inserted h4 m .    based on the estimations from above , in , we list the theoretical performance of h4 m storage in mof-5 , irmof-10 , and irmof-16 .",
    "since the pore size should be approximately commensurate with the unit cell size of crystalline h4 m , we can estimate a possibly largest h4 m supercell that would fit in each pore , according to the pore diameters @xcite . from that , we calculate the hydrogen mass density  including and not including the hydrogen in ch@xmath1 .",

    "since the deformation only plays a significant role in a region closer than the natural binding distance , we will use a 3.5    wall - to - wall distance and start all simulations from undistorted nanotubes in the calculations reported below . from our calculated wall - to - wall separation of nanotubes in bundles",

    "the length of one of the edges of the so h4 m crystalline unit cell at 5.8  gpa is very close to the unit cell length of carbon nanotubes in axial direction ( 4.27   ) .",
    "hence , we compress the h4 m unit cell slightly so that the edge is exactly commensurate and scale the other two edges accordingly .",
    "we then put @xmath44 supercells of h4 m inside the carbon nanotubes and relax the whole system .",
    "for example , since the diagonal length of the scaled h4 m unit cell is 6.6  (slightly bigger than the radius of the ( 16,0 ) carbon nanotube ) , it is natural to build the filled structure from a ( 16,0 ) nanotube together with a @xmath45 h4 m supercell .",

    "the structure of h4 m changes noticeably .",
    "the nanotube also deforms and exhibits a strain of 1.4% , which is more than we estimated in since we compressed the supercell slightly to make it commensurate ; but nevertheless , it withstands the pressure created by the h4 m inside .",

    "note that for tubes starting at ( 40,0 ) , the filling with supercells of h4 m is not simply a square - type pattern corresponding to @xmath44 , but we can fit in further unit cells on the side to better approximate the circular shape of the tube .",
    "the corresponding filling is then reported as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 indicates the number of additional unit cells of h4 m that we are able to fit in a given tube . according to our estimation ,",
