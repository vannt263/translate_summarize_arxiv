    "in many - body quantum mechanics , the notion of particle indistinguishability and statistics plays a fundamental role .",
    "namely , particles of the same kind are typically logically identical and fall into two classes : bosons or fermions , giving rise to such diverse phenomena as bose ",
    "einstein condensation in the former case , and the fermi sea with its implications for conduction bands , atomic structure , etc .",
    ", in the latter .",
    "however , while these are the only two options for fundamental particles that propagate in three - dimensional space , for quantum systems confined to lower dimensions there is a possibility for effective particles ( quasiparticles ) escaping the usual boson / fermion dichotomy .",
    "we shall here consider the two - dimensional case where the quantum state of a system of @xmath0 particles at positions @xmath1 may be described by a square - integrable normalized wave function - valued wave functions corresponding to abelian anyons , while @xmath2-valued , possibly non - abelian , anyons are also possible @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the probability density of finding the particles at positions @xmath5 . if the particles are indistinguishable the density needs to be symmetric : @xmath6 however , the exact phase of @xmath7 is not an observable quantity and therefore leaves room for an exchange phase , @xmath8 where @xmath9 ( @xmath10-periodic ) is called the statistics parameter .",
    "logical consistency demands this to be independent of the considered pair if we by mean that we make a continuous counterclockwise simple exhange of this pair of particles . if @xmath11 the particles are bosons ( symmetric @xmath7 ) , and if @xmath12 they are fermions ( antisymmetric @xmath7 ) . because of a topological obstruction unique to two dimensions , it turns out that _ any _ phase @xmath13 is allowed @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and the corresponding particles are therefore called anyons  @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for extensive reviews on this topic .",
    "the relative change of phase of a wave function @xmath7 with respect to changes of the coordinates , geometrically understood as due to the curvature of the corresponding complex line bundle of which @xmath7 is a section , is naturally described by a magnetic field , and also in the case of anyons one may model the above statistics phase as induced by a magnetic field .",
    "namely , one could start with @xmath14 ( or @xmath15 ) being bosonic ( fermionic ) and then attach magnetic fluxes to the particles so that their winding around each other gives rise to the correct phase .",
    "this is commonly called the magnetic gauge picture for anyons , and it is actually in this form that they may most realistically arise in a real physical system .",
    "the most promising such realization is in the context of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) @xcite , a strongly correlated planar electron ( or bosonic atom @xcite ) system in a strong transverse external magnetic field , where particles have the freedom to bind magnetic flux and thereby become anyons @xcite .",
    "however , in this case the flux typically has some extent determined by the experimental conditions , and one therefore talks about extended anyons @xcite as opposed to the purely theoretical ( but conceptually attractive ) ideal anyons which are purely pointlike . denoting the size of the flux ,",
    "say its radius if disk - shaped , by @xmath16 we can thus talk about @xmath17-extended anyons , and one may also introduce a dimensionless parameter @xmath18 to describe the state of the system , where @xmath19 denotes the average density of the particles .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 is the ratio of the magnetic dimension to the average interparticle distance and has therefore been called the magnetic filling ratio in @xcite .",
    "our interest in this paper is to study a free gas of such extended anyons , i.e.  ignoring any additional interactions , and focusing on the most basic aspect : its ground - state energy . in the ideal non - interacting case ,",
    "the quantum gas consisting of a large number of bosons or fermions in a large volume at fixed density has been completely understood since the early days of quantum mechanics and is nowadays often given as a text - book exercise .",
    "however , the purely anyonic case @xmath21 still remains an unsolved problem after almost four decades , owing to the fact that the statistical many - body interaction can not be completely removed in favor of a pure one - body state - counting description .",
    "the case of two anyons can be solved exactly @xcite , that of three and four anyons has been studied numerically @xcite , and beyond that various approximative descriptions have been proposed @xcite .",
    "one of these is called average - field theory ( cf .",
    "mean - field theory  @xcite ) whereby the flux of the anyons is seen as sufficiently spread out ( in other words @xmath20 should be sufficiently large ) so that they are effectively moving in a ( locally ) uniform magnetic field , say @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the flux of each anyon and @xmath24 the local density , and therefore have a definite magnetic ground - state energy given by that of the lowest landau level , hence proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "another approximation has been to assume that the gas is so dilute that only two - particle interactions are relevant @xcite .    except for a small number of results concerning the mathematical formulation of the many - anyon problem @xcite , there has not been much progress on the rigorous mathematical side until recently . in @xcite the case of ideal anyons was considered using a local approach involving a relative magnetic hardy inequality and a local exclusion principle , leading to a first set of non - trivial rigorous bounds for the ground - state energy of the ideal anyon gas .",
    "these bounds have an interesting non - trivial dependence on the statistics parameter @xmath26 in that they depend , in the many - body limit , solely on the quantity    @xmath27    which is zero unless @xmath26 is an odd - numerator fraction @xmath28 ( reduced , with @xmath29 ) and in which case @xmath30 . in @xcite a fundamental question concerning operator domains for ideal anyons was settled and applications of the local energy bounds to interacting systems were considered .",
    "also , the validity of the average - field approximation for the case of almost - bosonic ( @xmath31 ) @xmath17-extended anyons was proved in @xcite .",
    "here we shall consider the homogeneous @xmath17-extended anyon gas and build on the local approach of @xcite to prove a lower bound for the ground - state energy per particle with statistics parameter @xmath32 and magnetic filling ratio @xmath33 of the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a universal constant and @xmath36          2\\pi|\\alpha| , & \\quad \\gamma \\gtrsim 1 .",

    "this bound effectively interpolates between a dilute regime involving and a high - density regime with a dependence on @xmath26 that matches that of average - field theory .",
    "also in the case of even - numerator @xmath26 , where @xmath40 , the bound is strictly positive but vanishes in the dilute limit in a way similar to that of a dilute bose gas in two dimensions @xcite . this may however not be so surprising in the case that @xmath41 ( composite bosons ; cf .",
    "@xcite ) , considering the periodicity for ideal anyons .      in order to state our results",
    "precisely we need to introduce some notation that will be used throughout the paper .",
    "we take as our concrete model for @xmath17-extended anyons a set of @xmath0 identical charged bosons , to each of which has been attached a magnetic field in the shape of a disk with radius @xmath17 and total flux @xmath23 , and which is felt by all the other particles ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . such flux centered at the origin",
    "can be given concretely by the magnetic vector potential @xmath42 with @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 denotes the open ball / disk of radius @xmath17 centered at @xmath46 , and @xmath47 can be interpreted as a regularized distance .",
    "starting from a conventional magnetic hamiltonian formulation , the ( non - relativistic ) free kinetic energy operator is then @xmath48 where we have normalized physical units so that @xmath49 and the magnetically coupled momentum operator for each particle @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 corresponding to the total magnetic field felt by the particle @xmath53 @xmath54 we note that this form for the magnetic interaction is not only convenient but also realistic from the perspective of the fqhe @xcite .",
    "also note that we allow for any @xmath9 here .",
    "the operator acts on the bosonic space @xmath55 as an unbounded operator .",
    "let us denote by @xmath56 the natural ( minimal as well as maximal ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  5 ) ) domain of @xmath57 then this is also the natural form domain of , and @xmath58 . in the case",

    "we define the one - body density associated with any normalized state @xmath75 by @xmath76 while @xmath77 denotes the average density if confined to a domain ( typically a square ) @xmath78 , i.e.  @xmath79 .",
    "furthermore , with @xmath80 the fat diagonal of the configuration space @xmath81 , we note that we may use the density of @xmath82 in the domain @xmath56 ( again , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  5 ) ) .",
    "we are now ready to state our main results for @xmath17-extended anyons .    for ideal anyons",
    "the singular magnetic potential @xmath61 effectively excludes the diagonals @xmath83 from the configuration space , much like a strong repulsive point interaction . for @xmath17-extended anyons",
    "we have instead the following effective repulsive short - range interaction of soft - disk type :    [ lem : short - range ] + for any @xmath9 , @xmath59 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 we have that @xmath86    now , defining ( denoted @xmath87 in @xcite ) @xmath88 let us recall the following local many - particle magnetic hardy inequality for ideal anyons which was given in ( * ? ? ?",

    "our first main result is the following improvement and extension of the above inequality to @xmath17-extended anyons , thereby providing us with a concrete ( and indeed useful ) measure of the long - range effect of the statistical magnetic interaction :    [ thm : long - range ] + let @xmath9 , @xmath16 , @xmath95 and @xmath90 be open and convex .",

    "we note that the above inequality may in some sense be viewed as a refinement ( with respect to the relative angular part ) of the usual ( pointwise ) diamagnetic inequality :    [ lem : diamagnetic ] + for any @xmath9 , @xmath16 , @xmath84 and @xmath96 we have that @xmath117    for @xmath118 , the vector potential satisfies @xmath119 and hence it is covered by standard theorems ; see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  7.21 ) .",
    "for @xmath89 it is not , but the above diamagnetic inequality still holds in this case , as was proved in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  4 ) ( and actually our understanding of the form domain @xmath66 alluded to above depends on this general formulation of the inequality ) .",
    "the diamagnetic inequality of lemma  [ lem : diamagnetic ] says that the energy for anyons is always higher than that for free bosons , while the short - range inequality of lemma  [ lem : short - range ] tells us that the anyons also feel an effective repulsion proportional to @xmath120 whenever they overlap .",
    "taking a combination of these two bounds would then correspond to a two - dimensional soft - disk repulsive bose gas , whose energy in the dilute limit tends to zero logarithmically with the density ( here the magnetic filling ratio @xmath121 )  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , theorem  [ thm : long - range ] provides a local bound for the energy in the form of a long - range inverse - square repulsion , whose strength depends on the fractionality of @xmath26 via @xmath122 .",
    "while this ` statistical repulsion ' does not change the above repulsive picture much in the regime of high densities ( @xmath123 ) where the anyons already feel each other s magnetic fields by ( partially ) overlapping , it makes a significant difference in the dilute limit , resulting in a uniform bound for the energy from below in terms of @xmath124 . as in @xcite ,",
    "the reason for the dependence on @xmath125 and not directly @xmath26 in this bound is the local gauge invariance of the pairwise relative magnetic potential .",
    "namely , any even multiple of a unit flux enclosed in a two - particle exchange loop ( enclosing @xmath126 other particles in such a loop contributes @xmath127 multiples of an anyon flux in ) may be compensated for by an opposite and equally large orbital angular momentum of that same particle pair .",
    "however , for odd - numerator rational @xmath26 there can never be a complete cancellation of this type , and therefore there is always some long - range pair repulsion , @xmath128 .",
    "these effects are summarized in the following theorem concerning the @xmath17-extended anyon gas , which is our second main result :    [ thm : intro - gas ] + let @xmath129 , where @xmath130 , denote the ground - state energy per particle and unit density of the extended anyon gas in the thermodynamic limit at fixed @xmath9 , @xmath16 and density @xmath131 where dirichlet boundary conditions have been imposed , that is @xmath132 then @xmath133 for some universal constants @xmath134 , @xmath135 ( is defined in lemma  [ lem : localexclusionsr ] ) , and @xmath115 as in theorem  [ thm : long - range ] .",
