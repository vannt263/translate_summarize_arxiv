    "microwave parametric resonance of normal magnetic oscillations , such as electronic spin waves , nuclear spin waves and magnetoelastic waves is a powerful tool to study linear and nonlinear properties of magnetoordered systems ( ferromagnets , antiferromagnets and ferrites ) @xcite .",
    "parallel pumping of magnetic excitations , in which the microwave magnetic polarization is parallel to the external magnetic field , is one of the most convenient and popular methods of parametric resonance .",
    "a microwave magnetic field @xmath1 enhanced by a microwave resonator is applied to the sample parallel to its equilibrium magnetization , which is parallel to the steady external magnetic field @xmath2 .",
    "the alternating magnetic field excites the parametric resonance of the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the pumping field frequency and @xmath5 are the half - pump frequencies of excited in the sample parametric pair of waves with oppositly oriented wave vectors @xmath6 and @xmath7 .    the excited waves amplitudes grow exponentially when the microwave field amplitude @xmath8 exceeds the parametric resonance threshold @xmath9 .",
    "according to s theory @xcite , this growth is restricted by the nonlinearities of the magnetic system , which are exhibited by a ) phase mismatching of the forced magnetic oscillations with the microwave field and b ) by the positive nonlinear magnetic relaxation due to nonlinearities of magnetic system . in this theoretical picture",
    "the resonator cavity is considered to be just as an ancillary system that enhances microwave field amplitude on a sample .",
    "no other effect associated with the microwave resonator cavity is assumed in this small sample approximation approach .",
    "actually , the process of parallel pumping includes two steps .",
    "first , the external microwave source excites the same frequency @xmath4 microwave magnetic oscillation of the resonator cavity .",
    "second , this magnetic oscillation is absorbed by the parametic pair ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) of magnetic excitations of the sample . in principle",
    ", one can expect a backward radiation of the parametric pairs and a bunch of associated effects in the system of two interacting in resonance oscillations .",
    "however , in the simple picture of small sample approximation this backward radiation is assumed to be negligibly small compared to absorption ; only an energy flow from the microwave pump to the sample occurs .    notwithstading that examples of non - trivial role of microwave resonator to the process of parallel pumping of magnetic excitations have already been discussed in refs.@xcite",
    ", these facts did not attract much attention and the small sample approximation approach is still in wide use for the description of parallel pumping of magnetic oscillations .",
    "the main focus of the present paper is to demonstrate that theoretically predicted two decades ago @xcite nonlinear radiation damping , effect due to backward irradiation of parametric pairs to the resonator , is a common and dominant feature in the process of parallel pumping of magnetic excitations .    in this paper",
    "we studied parallel pumping in a helical resonator of a ) nuclear spin waves in an antiferromagnetic csmnf@xmath0 at liquid helium temperatures and b ) magnetoelastic waves in an antiferromagnetic febo@xmath0 at liquid nitrogen temperatures .",
    "the concept of nuclear spin waves was introduced by de gennes et al @xcite .",
    "the nuclear spin wave denotes the magnetic excitation of mixed electronic and nuclear spin oscillations that is situated in the nuclear magnetic resonance frequency range .",
    "the most remarkable property of these excitations is that , at liquid helium temperatures , they exhibit the coupled oscillations of two completely different in their magnetic properties subsystems .",
    "the electronic spins are ordered while the state of the nuclear spins is paramagnetic ; the polarization is no more than several percent . as a result of mixing of these two subsystems by hyperfine interaction , the frequency of the electronic spin waves increases , and",
    "the nuclear magnetic resonance frequency @xmath12 decreases and becomes noticeably lower than the larmor precession frequency @xmath13 of nuclear spins .",
    "in other words , there arises the so - called dynamic nuclear magnetic resonance pulling and the band of nuclear spin waves @xmath14 :    @xmath15^{1/2 } ,                      \\label{1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath16^{1/2}$ ] is the frequency of electronic spin wave , @xmath17 is the dzyaloshinskii field , @xmath18 is the gap due to hyperfine interaction , @xmath19 is the exchange constant and @xmath20 is the gyromagnetic ratio . the detailed review of nuclear spin wave properties in weakly anisotropic antiferromagnets is given in ref.@xcite .",
    "magnetoelastic waves describe normal modes of linearly coupled elastic waves and electronic spin waves in magnetoordered crystals .",
    "so far as the magnetoelastic waves contain both elastic and magnetic components , they can be excited both by elastic vibrations and by alternating magnetic field .",
    "one of the most interesting objects to study magnetoelastic waves is the high nel temperature antiferromagnet febo@xmath0 ( @xmath21 k ) .",
    "parallel pumping of magnetoelastic waves in this crystal for the first time was observed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the spectrum of magnetoelastic waves in iron borate can be written as @xcite :    @xmath22^{1/2 } ,                      \\label{2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 is the sound velocity , @xmath24 describes an efficiency of linear interaction between spin and elastic subsystems , @xmath25^{1/2}$ ] is the frequency of electronic spin wave and @xmath26 is the field which corresponds to magnetoelastic gap .",
    "we show that beyond the small sample approximation the resonator oscillation dynamics plays an extremely important role in the process of parametric resonance of nuclear spin waves and magnetoelastic waves and gives the dominant mechanism of parallel pumping restriction in both cases by the nonlinear radiation damping .",

    "the effective volume of this resonator is estimated as @xmath28 @xmath29 .",
    "the effect of microwave absorption is detected by the receiving antenna .",
    "this absorbing cell to study parallel pumping of nuclear spin waves and magnetoelastic waves was used at different temperature conditions .",
    "parametric pairs of nuclear spin waves were excited by a pulsed ( @xmath30 @xmath31 ) parallel microwave pump with repeating frequency @xmath32 hz in the helical resonator with the quality factor @xmath33 over a wide range of frequencies @xmath34 mhz .",

    "the relaxation rate of parametically excited spin waves estimated by the threshold amplituede was @xmath40 khz with the accuracy of 25 % .",
    "a typical form of the microwave pump pulse passed thorough the resonator is shown in the left side of fig.2 .",
    "there is a microwave absortpion by the parametric pairs ( upper part of the pulse ) which is demonstrated by the decrease of the pump pulse . at the end of the pulse",
    "one can see a general phenomenon , a non - uniform time dependence with a peak of the microwave radiation after the pump pulse , a typical oscillation of the microwave pulse which appears above the threshold of parametric resonance .",
    "we could observe this non - trivial radiation at @xmath41 .",
    "the peak demonstrates a beating of magnetic oscillation of the resonator cavity mode with the parametic pair @xcite . in this case",
    "the lineshape of the cavity - sample system becomes splitted into two humps @xcite which is a direct indication that the small sample approximation is not valid any more .",
    "experimentally we observed one peak if the pump frequency was equal to the frequency of the resonator @xmath42 and up to three beating peaks if @xmath43 .",
    "it should be noted that below the threshold of parametric resonance the microwave radiation after the pump pulse demonstrates just an exponential decrease ( see , curve 2 in fig.2 ) , which corresponds to unloaded resonator cavity irradiation .",

    "typical experimental data of irradiation are shown in fig.3 .",
    "we found very important feature of experiments with irradiation : the radiation power is approximately equal to the absorption power .",
    "thus , the stationary state of parametric pairs is defined by the radiation from the sample through the `` sample - resonator '' nonlinear interaction .",
