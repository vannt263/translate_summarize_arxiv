    "in the study of interconnection and communication networks , the theory of digraphs plays a key role because , in many cases , the links between nodes are unidirectional . in this theory , there are three concepts that have shown to be very fruitful to construct good and efficient networks .",
    "namely , those of quotient digraphs , voltage digraphs and ( partial ) line digraphs . roughly speaking ,",
    "quotient digraphs allow us to obtain a simplified or ` condensed ' version of a bigger digraph , while the voltage and line digraph techniques do the converse by ` expanding ' a smaller digraph . from this point of view , it is natural that the three techniques have close relationships . in this paper",
    "we explore some of such interrelations by introducing a general construction that we call expanded digraphs .",
    "these digraphs are obtained from a base graph whose vertices become vertex sets in the new graph , and the adjacencies are defined from a set of mappings .",
    "a special case is obtained when such mappings are defined within a group , so obtaining the lifted graphs of base graphs with assigned voltages ( elements of the group ) on its arcs . in this context , we show that de bruijn and kautz digraphs can be defined as lifted digraphs of smaller de bruijn digraphs .",
    "moreover , it is proved that , under some sufficient conditions , the lift of a base graph that is a line digraph is again a line digraph . in the more general case of nonrestricted maps",
    ", we consider the quotient digraphs , and the equivalent constructions of vertex - split digraphs and partial line digraphs . here",
    ", it turns out that the line digraph and quotient operations commute .",
    "finally , it is proved that the techniques of vertex - splitting and partial line digraph are equivalent , and some consequences are derived .",
    "let us first recall some basic terminology and notation concerning digraphs",
    ". for the concepts and/or results not presented here , we refer the reader to some of the basic textbooks on the subject ; see , for instance , chartrand and lesniak  @xcite or diestel  @xcite .    through this paper , @xmath0 denotes a digraph , with vertex set @xmath1 and arc set @xmath2 . an arc from vertex @xmath3 to vertex @xmath4",
    "is denoted by either @xmath5 , @xmath6 , or @xmath7 .",
    "we allow _ loops _ ( that is , arcs from a vertex to itself ) , and _",
    "multiple arcs_. the set of vertices adjacent to and from @xmath8 is denoted by @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "such vertices are referred to as _ in - neighbors _ and _ out - neighbors _ of @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "moreover , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the _ in - degree _ and _ out - degree _ of vertex @xmath4 , and @xmath13 is _ @xmath14-regular _ when @xmath15 for any @xmath8 .",
    "expanded digraphs are , in fact , a type of compounding that consists of connecting together several copies of a ( di)graph by setting some ( directed ) edges between any two copies .",
    "let @xmath0 be a ( base ) digraph on @xmath16 vertices .",
    "as said before , we allow loops and multiple arcs .",
    "assume that each vertex @xmath8 has assigned a vertex set @xmath17 , and each arc @xmath18 has assigned a mapping @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath20 .",
    "the _ expanded digraph _",
    "@xmath21 of @xmath13 with respect to @xmath22 has vertex set @xmath23 , and there is an arc from @xmath24 to @xmath25 whenever @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "some important particular cases of this construction are obtained when the mappings in @xmath22 are defined from a group :    * * cayley digraphs*. let @xmath28 be a group with generating set @xmath29 having @xmath30 elements . if @xmath13 is a singleton with assigned vertex set @xmath28 , @xmath30 loops , and each loop @xmath31 has the mapping @xmath32 , with @xmath33 , then the expanded digraph @xmath21 is the _ cayley digraph _ @xmath34 . *",
    "* coset digraphs*. let @xmath28 be a group with generating set @xmath29 having @xmath30 elements and with subgroup @xmath35 .",
    "if @xmath13 is a singleton with assigned vertex set @xmath36 , @xmath30 loops , and each loop @xmath31 has the mapping @xmath37 , with @xmath33 , then the expanded digraph @xmath21 corresponds to the _ coset digraph _ @xmath38 .",
    "two natural generalizations of these concepts are the following ( as far as we know , the second one is a new proposal ) :    * * lifted ( of voltage ) digraphs * or * expanded cayley digraphs*. let @xmath28 be a group with generating set @xmath29 having @xmath30 elements .",
    "if each vertex of @xmath13 is assigned to the vertex set @xmath28 , and each arc @xmath31 has the mapping @xmath39 , with @xmath33 , then the expanded digraph @xmath21 is the so - called _ lifted digraph _",
    "( or simply _ lift _ ) @xmath40 ( see section [ sec : voltage ] ) . * * expanded coset digraphs*. let @xmath28 be a group with generating set @xmath29 having @xmath30 elements and with subgroup @xmath35 .",
    "if each vertex of @xmath13 is assigned to the vertex set @xmath36 , and each arc @xmath31 has the mapping @xmath37 , with @xmath33 , then we refer to the corresponding expanded digraph @xmath21 as the _ expanded coset digraph _ @xmath40 .",
    "when a group is involved in the setting of the mappings , the symmetry of the obtained constructions yield digraphs with large automorphism groups . to our knowledge ,",
    "one of the first papers where voltage ( undirected ) graphs were used for construction of dense graphs was that of alegre , fiol and yebra  @xcite , but without using the name of ` voltage graphs ' .",
    "this name was coined previously by gross  @xcite . for more information ,",
    "see gross and tucker  @xcite , baskoro , brankovi , miller , plesnk , ryan and ir  @xcite , and miller and ir  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath13 be a digraph with vertex set @xmath41 and arc set @xmath42 .",
    "then , given a group @xmath28 with generating set @xmath29 , a voltage assignment of @xmath13 is a mapping @xmath43 .",
    "the lift @xmath44 is the digraph with vertex set @xmath45 and arc set @xmath46 , where there is an arc from vertex @xmath47 to vertex @xmath48 if and only if @xmath49 and @xmath50 . such an arc is denoted by @xmath51 .",
    "recall that the _ de bruijn digraph _ @xmath52 has vertices @xmath53 , where @xmath54 for @xmath55 , and adjacencies @xmath56 in contrast with that , the _ kautz digraph _ @xmath57 has vertices @xmath53 , where @xmath58 , @xmath59 for @xmath60 , and adjacencies : @xmath61 now , if we consider the mapping @xmath62 two alternative definitions are the following : the de bruijn digraph @xmath52 has vertices @xmath63 , where @xmath64 , and adjacencies : @xmath65 similarly , the kautz digraph @xmath57 has vertices @xmath66 , where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and adjacencies : @xmath69 notice that the mapping @xmath70 where @xmath71 , is a homomorphism from the kautz digraph @xmath57 to the de bruijn digraph @xmath72 .",
    "also , note the inverse mapping @xmath73 now we show that both de bruijn and kautz digraphs can be seen as lifts of smaller de bruijn digraphs with appropriate voltage assignments .",
    "[ lemmadb ] the equality @xmath74 holds with @xmath75    the vertices of the arc @xmath76 in @xmath52 , with voltage @xmath77 , give rise to the vertex subsets @xmath78 and @xmath79 in @xmath80 .",
    "moreover , the elements of @xmath81 can be written as @xmath82 and @xmath83 thus , if we define the mapping @xmath84 in such a way that @xmath85 , we get the adjacencies @xmath86 with @xmath87 , which correspond to those of the de bruijn digraph @xmath88 , as claimed .    as an example , figure  [ voltage - debruijn - dibuix ] shows how to obtain @xmath89 as a lifted digraph of @xmath90 .     as a lifted digraph of the base digraph @xmath90.,width=529 ]",
    "-14 cm    similarly , the following result shows that kautz digraphs can be seen as lifted digraphs of de bruijn digraphs .",
    "the equality @xmath91 holds with @xmath92 where @xmath93 .",
    "the proof is similar to that of proposition [ lemmadb ] .",
    "indeed , the vertices of the arc @xmath76 in @xmath52 , with @xmath93 and voltage @xmath77 , give rise to the vertex subsets @xmath94 and @xmath95 in @xmath96 .",
    "moreover , the elements of @xmath97 can be written as @xmath98 and @xmath99 thus , if we define the mapping @xmath100 in such a way that @xmath85 , we get the adjacencies @xmath86 with @xmath101 , which correspond to those of the kautz digraph @xmath102 .",
    "this completes the proof .    by way of example , in figure  [ k(2,3)voltage - dibuix ] we show how @xmath103 can be seen as a lifted digraph of @xmath90 .     as a lifted digraph of the base digraph @xmath90.,width=529 ]    -13.5 cm",
    "in the more general context of nonrestricted maps , we now consider the quotient digraphs , and the equivalent constructions of vertex - split digraphs and partial line digraphs .",
    "let @xmath0 be a digraph with @xmath16 vertices .",
    "a partition @xmath104 of its vertex set @xmath105 , for @xmath106 , is called _ regular _ if the number @xmath107 of arcs from a vertex @xmath108 to vertices in @xmath109 only depends on @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the numbers @xmath107 are usually called _ intersection parameters _ of the partition .",
    "the _ quotient digraph _ of @xmath13 with respect to @xmath104 , denoted by @xmath112 , has vertices the subsets @xmath113 , for @xmath114 , and @xmath107 parallel arcs from vertex @xmath113 to vertex @xmath109 .      in the _ line digraph _ @xmath115 of a digraph @xmath13",
    ", each vertex represents an arc of @xmath13 , that is , @xmath116 , and a vertex @xmath6 is adjacent to a vertex @xmath117 when the arc @xmath5 is adjacent to the arc @xmath118 : @xmath119 .",
    "line digraphs have shown to be very interesting structures in the study of dense digraphs ( that is , digraphs with a large number of vertices for given degree and diameter ) . moreover ,",
    "it is know that the iteration of the line digraph technique yields digraphs with maximum connectivity . for more details ,",
    "see , for instance the papers by fiol , yebra , and alegre  @xcite , and fbrega and fiol  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , by the heuchenne s condition  @xcite , a digraph @xmath13 is a line digraph if and only if , for every pair of vertices @xmath3 and @xmath4 , either @xmath120 or @xmath121",
    ".          let @xmath124 be a regular partition of @xmath13 with intersection parameters @xmath107 .",
    "then , consider the induced partition of its arcs ( or vertices of @xmath115 ) @xmath125 with sets @xmath126 . this partition is also regular since , from the definition of line digraph , the number of arcs from a vertex @xmath127 to any vertex @xmath128 is @xmath129 . to prove the digraph isomorphism ,",
    "assume that @xmath130 has the arc @xmath131 .",
    "this means that in @xmath13 there is the path @xmath132 , where @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 . but",
    "@xmath127 and @xmath136 so that , in @xmath137 , there is the arc @xmath138 and this concludes the proof .",
    "[ prop : lift - is - a - ld ] let @xmath139 be a digraph endowed with a voltage assignment @xmath140 . if @xmath13 is a line digraph , and for every pair of vertices @xmath3 and @xmath4 with common out - neighbor sets @xmath141 , we have @xmath142 then , the lifted digraph @xmath40 is again a line digraph .",
    "it suffices to prove that @xmath40 satisfies heuchenne s condition . with this aim ,",
    "let @xmath143 , so that in @xmath40 the vertex @xmath47 is adjacent to the vertices @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "now , if there is a vertex @xmath8 such that @xmath146 , we also have @xmath147 ( because @xmath13 is a line digraph ) .",
    "but the former implies that vertex @xmath48 , where @xmath148 is adjacent to vertex @xmath149 moreover , from ( [ line - condition ] ) interchanging @xmath110 and @xmath111 , we get that @xmath150 .",
    "let us now consider what we call _ the vertex - splitting method _ to `` blow up '' a digraph . given a digraph @xmath139 on @xmath16 vertices and @xmath152 arcs , the vertex - split digraph @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is constructed as follows .",
    "every vertex @xmath8 is split into @xmath155 vertices @xmath156 , where @xmath157 .",

    "( notice that this is always possible , as @xmath164 for every @xmath165 . )",
