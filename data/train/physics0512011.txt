    "as a breakthrough in network science @xcite , it has been found @xcite that many real systems of social , technological , and biological origins have the surprisingly common topological structure called _ small - world _ ( sw ) @xcite and _ scale - free _ ( sf ) @xcite .",
    "the structure is characterized by the sw properties that the average path length over all nodes ( vertices ) is short as similar to that in random graphs , and that the clustering coefficient , defined by the average ratio of the number of links ( edges ) connecting to its nearest neighbors of a node to the number of possible links between all these nearest neighbors , is large as similar to that in regular graphs .",
    "large clustering coefficient means the high frequency of `` the friend of a friend is also his / her friend . '' as the sf property , the degree distribution follows a power - law , @xmath0 , @xmath1 ; the fat - tail distribution consists of many nodes with low degrees and a few hubs with very high degrees . moreover , a proposal of the universal mechanisms @xcite to generate sf networks inspired to elucidate the topological properties .",
    "one of the advantage is that sf networks are optimal in minimizing both the effort for communication and the cost for maintaining the connections @xcite . intuitively , sf network is positioned between star or clique graph for minimizing the path length ( the number of hops or legs ) and random tree for minimizing the number of links within the connectivity .",
    "another important property is that sf networks are robust against random failures but vulnerable against the targeted attacks on hubs .",
    "this vulnerability called `` achilles heel of the internet ''",
    "@xcite frightened us .",
    "however the vulnerability is a double - edged sword for information delivery and spreading of viruses , we expect that these properties will be useful for developing efficient and fault - tolerant networks with a defense mechanism based on the protection of hubs . since the sf structure is at least selected with self - organized manners in social and biological environments , the evolutional mechanisms may give insight to distributed network designs or social managements in communication or business .",
    "on the other hand , in contrast to abstract graphs , many real networks are embedded in a metric space .",
    "it is therefore natural to investigate the possibility of embedding sf networks in space .",
    "the related applications are very wide in the internet(routers ) , power - grids , airlines , mobile communication @xcite , sensor networks @xcite , and so on .",
    "however most of the works on sf networks were irrelevant to a geographical space . in this paper , focusing on the sf structure found in many real systems , we consider generation rules of geographical networks whose nodes are set on a euclidean space and the undirected links between them are weighted by the euclidean distance .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we introduce an example that shows the restriction of long - range links in real networks .",
    "indeed , the decay of connection probability for the distance between nodes follows exponential or power - law . in section 3 ,",
    "we review recent studies of geographical sf network models , which are categorized in three classes by the generation rules .",
    "we refer to the analytical forms of degree distributions that characterize the sf structure .",
    "in section 4 , we consider the relations among these models .",
    "in addition , we compare the properties of planarity and distance of connections . finally , in section 5 , the summary and further issues are briefly discussed .",
    "the restriction of long - range links has been observed in real networks : internet at both router and autonomous system ( as ) levels obtained by using netgeo tool to identify the geographical coordinates of 228,265 routers @xcite .",
    "these data suggest that the distribution of link lengths ( distance ) is inversely proportional to the lengths , invalidating the waxman s exponentially decay rule @xcite which is widely used in traffic simulations .",
    "other evidence has been reported for the real data of internet as as level ( 7,049 nodes and 13,831 links ) compiled by the university of oregon s route views project , road networks of us interstate highway ( 935 nodes and 1,337 links ) extracted from gis databases , and flight - connections ( 187 nodes and 825 links ) in a major airline @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that all three networks have a clear bias towards shorter links to reduce the costs for construction and maintenance , however there exist some differences : the road network has only very short links on the order of 10 km to 100 km in the sharply decaying distribution , while the internet and airline networks have much longer ones in the bimodal distribution with distinct peaks around 2000 km or less and 4000 km .",
    "these differences may come from physical constraints in the link cost or the necessaries of long distant direct connections .    as a similar example , we investigate the distributions of link lengths ( distances of flights ) in japanese airlines @xcite .",
    "the networks consists of 52 nodes ( airports ) and 961 links ( flights ) in the japan airlines ( jal ) , 49 nodes and 909 links in the all nippon airlines ( ana ) , and 84 nodes and 1,114 links including the international one .",
    "[ fig_airlines_data ] shows the cumulative number of flights for the decreasing order of length measured by mile .",
    "we remark an exponential decay in the domestic flights ( red and blue lines in the fig .",
    "[ fig_airlines_data ] ) , while it rather follows a power - law by adding the international flights ( green line in the fig .",
    "[ fig_airlines_data ] ) .",
    "note that the distribution of the link lengths is obtained by the differential of the cumulative one and that the decay form of exponential or power - law is invariant .",
    "thus , link lengths are restricted in real systems , although the distribution may have some various forms as similar to the cases of degree distribution @xcite .",

    "we review geographical sf network models in the state - of - the - art . by the generation rules of networks , they are categorized in three classes as shown in table [ table_models ] .",
    "the generation rules are explained by variations in the balance of minimizing the number of hops between nodes ( benefits for transfers ) and the link lengths .    in this section",
    ", we refer to the generation rules and the power - law behavior only in the essential forms because of the limited pages .",
    "the properties of planarity without crossing links and the link lengths will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the modulated barabsi - albert ( ba ) model @xcite and the geographical threshold graph @xcite belong to the first class : sf networks with disadvantaged long - range links between nodes whose positions are random on a space .",
    "they are natural extensions of the previous non - geographical sf network models by the competition of preferential linking based on the degree or weight and the restriction of link length ( distance dependence ) .      before explaining the first class , we introduce the well - known ba model @xcite generated by the following rule : _ growth _ with a new node at each time and _ preferential attachment _ of links to nodes with large degrees ( see fig . [ fig_schema](a ) ) .",

    "ba - step 2 : : :    any of these @xmath7 links of the new node introduced at time    @xmath8 connects a previous node @xmath9 with an    attachment probability @xmath10 which is linearly    proportional to the degree @xmath11 of the    @xmath9th node at time @xmath8 ,    @xmath12 .",
    "the preferential attachment makes a heterogeneous network with hubs .",
    "more precisely , the degree distribution @xmath13 is analytically obtained by using a mean - field approximation @xcite in the continuum approach @xcite , in which the time dependence of the degree @xmath14 of a given node @xmath9 is calculated through the continuous real variables of degree and time .    based on a competition between the preferential attachment and the distance dependence of links , the modulated ba model on a space with physical distance has been considered @xcite .",
    "note that the position of new node is random .",
    "the network is grown by introducing at unit rate randomly selected nodes on the euclidean space ( e.g. two - dimensional square area ) , and the probability of connection is modulated according to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the euclidean distance between the @xmath8th ( birth at time @xmath8 ) and the older @xmath9th nodes , and @xmath17 is a parameter .",

    ", only the smallest value of @xmath16 corresponding to the nearest node will contribute with probability @xmath20 .",
    "similarly , in the limit of @xmath21 , only the furthest node will contribute .",
    "indeed , it has been estimated that the distribution of link lengths follows a power - law @xmath22 ( long - range links are rare at @xmath23 ) , whose exponent is calculated by @xmath24 for all values of @xmath17 @xcite .    in the modulated ba model on a one - dimensional lattice ( circumference )",
    ", it has been numerically shown that @xcite for @xmath25 the degree distribution is close to a power - law , but for @xmath26 it is represented by a stretched exponential @xmath27 , where the parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 depend on @xmath17 and @xmath7 , although the sw property @xcite is preserved at all values of @xmath17 .",
    "for the transition from the stretched exponential to the sf behavior , the critical value is generalized to @xmath31 in the embedded @xmath32-dimensional space @xcite .",
    "more systematic classification in a parameter space of the exponents of degree , distance , and fractal dimension has been also discussed @xcite .",

    "it is embedded in the @xmath32-dimensional euclidean space with disadvantaged long - range links .",
    "we briefly show the analysis of degree distribution .",
    "let us consider a set of nodes with the size @xmath38 .",
    "we assume that each node @xmath9 is randomly distributed with uniform density @xmath39 in the space whose coordinates are denoted by @xmath40 , and that it is assigned with a weight @xmath41 by a density function @xmath42 .",
    "according to the threshold mechanism @xcite , a pair of node @xmath43 is connected iff @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a decreasing function of the distance @xmath46 between the nodes , and @xmath47 is a constant threshold .",
    "if @xmath42 is the dirac delta function at @xmath48 , then the condition of connection ( [ eq_cond_thresh ] ) is equivalent to @xmath49 by using the inverse function @xmath50 .",
    "this case is the unit disk graph , as a model of mobile and sensor networks , in which the two nodes within the radius @xmath51 are connected according to the energy consumption .",
    "however , the degree distribution @xmath52 is homogeneous .",
    "we need more inhomogeneous weights .",
    "thus , if the exponential weight distribution @xmath53 and the power - law decay function @xmath54 , @xmath55 , are considered , then the degree is derived as a function of weight @xmath56 after slightly complicated calculations .",
    "the second integral in the r.h.s of ( [ eq_kw ] ) is the volume of @xmath32-dimensional hypersphere . as in refs .",
    "@xcite @xcite , by using the relation of cumulative distributions @xmath57 , we have @xmath58 from ( [ eq_kw ] ) and ( [ eq_pk ] ) , we obtain the power - law degree distribution @xmath59 note that this result is derived only if the value of @xmath34 is sufficiently small , otherwise the degree distribution has a streched exponential decay or an exponential decay .",
    "on the other hand , for the power - law weight distribution ( called parete distribution in this form ) @xmath60 we similarly obtain @xmath61 the exponent @xmath62 is a variable depends on the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath34 .    furthermore , we mention a gravity model with @xmath63 . in this case , the condition of connection ( [ eq_cond_thresh ] ) is rewritten as @xmath64 , and into @xmath65 by the variable transformations @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",

    ", we can also derive the more complicated forms of @xmath52 .",

    "@xcite have proposed a similar embedding algorithm in a two - dimensional lattice , however the number of nodes in each circle is equal to the connectivity without cutoff .",

    "<S> the scale - free ( sf ) structure that commonly appears in many complex networks is one of the hot topics related to social , biological , and information sciences . </S>",
    "<S> the self - organized generation mechanisms are expected to be useful for efficient communication or robust connectivity in socio - technological infrastructures . </S>",
    "<S> this paper is the first review of geographical sf network models . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the essential generation mechanisms to induce the structure with power - law behavior and the properties of planarity and link length . </S>",
    "<S> the distributed designs of geographical sf networks without the crossing and long - range links that cause the interference and dissipation problems are very important for many applications such as in the internet , power - grid , mobile , and sensor systems . </S>"
