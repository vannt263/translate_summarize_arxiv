    "we choose the @xmath20-mode to be the zero - mode , and thus concentrate on the behavior in the transverse @xmath8-direction only , that is , we investigate the beams in the @xmath56-plane . for easy comparison , we depict focused beams with a beam parameter of @xmath57 .",

    "we can clearly see the interference between modes @xmath59 and @xmath60 at work and how it leads to the redistribution of the intensity from one beam edge to the other , thus inverting the transverse beam profile about the beam axis .",
    "this intensity redistribution is ultimately due to the mode - dispersive effect of the gouy - phase factor @xmath61 in the optical case and the time phase factor @xmath62 for the two - dimensional harmonic oscillator .",
    "note that a beam that is focused only in one transversal direction ( using a cylindrical lens rather than a spherical one ) corresponds to a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator,@xcite because in this case the gouy - phase factor is @xmath63 and corresponds to a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator phase factor @xmath64 . clearly , both systems evolve through half an oscillation period ( @xmath65 .",
    "( remember , the gouy - phase ( [ gouy.phase ] ) varies from @xmath66 to @xmath67 . )    we know from ray optics that images become inverted at the focus . here",
    "we see how this image inversion arises through the action of the gouy - phase . in the language of the harmonic oscillator",

    "we plot the beam s instantaneous intensity distribution @xmath69 in fig .  [ fig3i4_wavefronts ] .",
    "it can clearly be seen that the relative phase of @xmath70 between modes 4 and 3 tilts the wave fronts , and the action of the gouy - phase `` transports '' the beam s envelope across the focus .     +    similarly to the case discussed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , but at first seemingly less intuitively , we can also have a scenario where the harmonic oscillator starts out with an average position at the beam center , then swings up to one side and falls back to the center .",
    "in wave optical terms this scenario corresponds to a field with a symmetric far - field distribution that is asymmetric at the focus and becomes symmetric in the far - field on the other side , this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_34 ] .",
    "+    it also is possible to create a beam that , in oscillator language , starts out in the center and swings to either side to fall back to the center forming an annulus with a dark center at the beam s focus ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_02 ] ) .",
    "it also can be viewed as a beam that is overly focused in the far field .",
    "then , according to heisenberg s uncertainty principle @xmath71 , such a spatially strongly localized harmonic oscillator carries a large momentum uncertainty . the bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig_02 ] displays the harmonic oscillator ground state together with the superposition of modes 0 and 2 .",
    "clearly the superposition is spatially more confined than the ground state , and its fourier transform reveals a large spread , namely , a central peak and two momentum peaks that are displaced from zero .",
    "in other words , this superposition describes a harmonic oscillator that `` explodes '' sideways and then swings back to the center .",
    "the seemingly counterintuitive formation of a dark center at the focus becomes easy to understand .",
    "its two - dimensional analog is the optical bottle beam observed very recently.@xcite the latter is formed from a superposition of laguerre - gaussian modes 0 and 2 , and thus carries basically the same structure in a cylindrical geometry as our example of fig .",
    "[ fig_02 ] in the @xmath56-plane .",
    "a possible technical implementation of the patterns discussed here is sketched in fig .",
    "[ setup.sketch ] and has recently been demonstrated experimentally.@xcite for further details on experimental implementations using computer - generated holograms , consult refs .  .",
    "the field profiles sketched here should be useful for optical manipulation techniques as well.@xcite    = 3.4 in = 1.3 in",
    "focused beams can not be described by ray optics in their focal region .",
    "therefore an intuitive understanding of the wave optical behavior of a coherent , focused beam with transverse intensity modulation is desirable .",
    "it is shown that the paraxial wave equation is equivalent to the schrdinger equation of a two - dimensional harmonic oscillator .",
    "this equivalence is used to show how the passage of a beam through its focus can be understood in terms of the behavior of a harmonic oscillator evolving through half a period .",
    "in particular , the inversion of a focused beam s far - field intensity pattern about the beam axis , upon passage through the focus , is described in terms of a harmonic oscillator swinging to the `` other '' side , and the formation of a bottle beam is explained by the behavior of a constricted beam pattern that corresponds to a harmonic oscillator fanning outward and recollapsing .",
