    "consequently , a discovery of  at currently measurable levels would be inconsistent with the standard model , and would provide a clear signal for new physics .    experimentally , mixing is identified by a change in the charm quantum number of the neutral @xmath4 meson between its production and decay . in the analysis presented in this paper , the charm of the produced @xmath4 is determined from the decay @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 ) , where the charge of the pion indicates whether a @xmath19 or a @xmath20 was produced .",
    "@xmath4 decays are reconstructed in four all - charged hadronic decay modes @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "( hereafter , we will omit the charge superscripts from the final states where context allows . )",
    "possible evidence for mixing comes from the detection of a meson produced as a @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) decaying to a `` wrong - sign '' final state which contains a @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) , with the kaon charge opposite to that expected for unmixed decays .",
    "fermilab experiment e691 @xcite has previously used this technique to set what is currently the strictest upper limit on mixing , @xmath27 , albeit with specific assumptions which we will address in this paper .",
    "fermilab experiment e615 obtained a limit of @xmath28 by looking for same - sign muon pairs in @xmath29-tungsten interactions , based on a specific model for charm production @xcite .",

    ", we examine a sample of about 9,100 reconstructed , tagged @xmath19 decays to look for wrong - sign decays , using the different time distributions to separate the dcs and mixing contributions in our search .",
    "as we shall see , there are no significant wrong - sign signals in our data , which leads us to set restrictions on the ratio of wrong - sign to right - sign rates .",
    "the most likely fit ( in the possible standard model scenarios ) will be presented first .",
    "afterwards , we will determine the effects of relaxing all constraints and of additional constraints ( absence of dcs  mixing interference , no mixing at all ) which investigate interesting physics cases or are necessary to compare with previously published results .",
    "equation  ( [ ratef ] ) describes the rate for @xmath19 to decay to a wrong - sign final state @xmath47 . within the context of some new physics models , it is possible that the rate for @xmath20 to decay to @xmath48 is not the same , and that cp is violated to a significant extent .",
    "thus , it is important to allow for the possibility of cp violation .",
    "this results in the most conservative upper limit on wrong - sign decays .",

    "inequality of the two constant terms ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath51 , but see comment @xcite ) is referred to as @xmath52 cp violation",
    ". this could be significant if two or more comparable dcs amplitudes contribute with different cp - conserving and cp - violating phases .",
    "however , the standard model contribution ( which is expected to dominate ) provides only one weak , cp - violating phase .",
    "direct cp violation is therefore likely to be small .",
    "similarly , the two charge conjugate terms proportional to @xmath45 will be the same unless there are two or more mixing amplitudes with relative cp - violating and cp - conserving phases .",
    "on the contrary , most models suggest that if mixing occurs at all , it is likely to be dominated by a single cp - violating phase .",
    "therefore , the most plausible constraint involving cp violation restricts cp violation to the interference term .",
    "we will explore this possibility , as well as the more general case without cp restrictions , in the study of our data which follows .",
    "we report the results of a search for  and dcs decays using hadronic decays found in data from our experiment , fermilab e791 .",
    "we collected approximately @xmath53 hadronic interactions in the 1991 - 2 fixed - target run using the tpl spectrometer @xcite with a 500 gev/@xmath54 @xmath55 beam .",
    "there were five foil targets : one @xmath56-mm thick pt foil followed by four @xmath57-mm thick diamond foils with 15 mm center - to - center separations .",
    "this arrangement allowed us to greatly reduce secondary interaction backgrounds by selecting only charm candidates which decayed in air .",
    "the target region was preceded by six planes of silicon microstrip detectors and 8 proportional wire chambers ( pwc s ) used for beam tracking and was followed by 17 additional planes of silicon microstrip detectors for measuring tracks produced at and downstream of the primary vertex .",
    "the track momenta and slopes were also measured in the downstream spectrometer which had two magnets , 35 planes of drift chambers , and two pwc s .",
    "two threshold counters provided @xmath29/@xmath58 separation in the 6 - 60 gev/@xmath54 momentum range @xcite .",
    "the mixing analysis in this paper relies heavily on track reconstruction , which begins by using hits in the silicon detector and folds in additional information from the downstream devices .",
    "the tracking efficiency is approximately 80%  for particles with momenta greater than 30 gev/@xmath54 and drops to around 60%  for particle momenta of 10 gev/@xmath54 .",
    "the mean number of reconstructed tracks used to fit the primary vertex is seven .",
    "after reconstruction , events with evidence of multiple vertices were kept for further analysis .",
    "the list of reconstructed vertices is used in the selection criteria described below .",
    "we determined our production ( primary ) and decay vertex resolutions by comparing reconstructed and true vertex positions using our monte carlo detector simulation .",
    "the transverse resolutions quoted below are one - dimensional values .",
    "longitudinal and transverse position resolutions for the primary vertex are 350 and 6 @xmath59 , respectively . for the mean @xmath0 momentum of 65 gev/@xmath54 the longitudinal resolutions for @xmath8 and @xmath60 vertices are 320 and 395 @xmath61 m , respectively , and increase by 33 and 36 @xmath61 m , respectively , for every 10 gev/@xmath54 @xmath0 momentum .",
    "similarly , for the mean momentum , 65 gev/@xmath54 , of the observed @xmath0 s , the transverse resolutions for @xmath8 and @xmath60 vertices are 10 and 12 @xmath61 m respectively and decrease by about 0.5 @xmath61 m for every 10 gev/@xmath54 increase in @xmath0 momentum .",
    "the kaon and pion identification efficiencies and misidentification probabilities vary with momentum and with the signatures we require in the detector . for typical particle momenta in the range",
    "20 gev/@xmath54 to 40 gev/@xmath54 , the identification efficiency of a kaon is around 58%  when the probability for a pion to be misidentified as a kaon is 4% . in the same momentum range the identification efficiency of a pion is around 93%  when the probability for a kaon to be misidentified as a pion is 35% .",
    "a search for the rare wrong - sign mixing and dcs decays requires selection criteria that emphasize background reduction .",
    "we achieve this goal in two stages : initially reconstructing displaced secondary vertices and using a few loose criteria for selecting @xmath19 decays to reduce the data sample , and then optimizing the data selection with artificial neural networks .",
    "initial reduction of the large e791 data set to a manageable size was achieved with the aid of a few simple criteria . here",
    ", we describe the cuts made in these initial stages for the @xmath62 mode .",
    "( when we refer to @xmath8 or @xmath60 in this paper , without any explicit signs , we include the charge conjugate states . otherwise , we indicate a specific final state by explicitly specifying at least the kaon charge or specifying right - sign ( rs ) or wrong - sign ( ws ) decays . ) two - prong vertices were used to start the search for @xmath19 decays .",
    "the invariant mass of the two - prong @xmath19 candidate , assumed to be @xmath8 , was required to be in the range 1.7 to 2.0 gev/@xmath63 .",
    "the kaon candidate was chosen as the one with the higher probability of being a kaon based on information . to further reduce the contributions from misidentified @xmath19 decays ,",
    "@xmath8 candidates were rejected if the reverse hypothesis ( @xmath64 ) fell within 2 @xmath65 of the @xmath19 mass , where @xmath65 is the measurement resolution for the @xmath0 mass .",
    "similarly , to reduce contamination from @xmath19 decays to @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath8 candidates were rejected if the @xmath66 or @xmath67 mass hypotheses fell within 2 @xmath65 of the @xmath19 mass . to help ensure that the reconstructed secondary vertex was a true decay vertex",
    ", we required that it be separated from the primary vertex by at least 8 standard deviations ( @xmath68 ) in the beam direction ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath69 ) .",
    "two further requirements ensured that the reconstructed @xmath19 was consistent with originating at the primary vertex .",
    "first , the impact parameter of the reconstructed @xmath4 momentum with respect to the primary vertex , @xmath70 , was required to be less than 60 @xmath61 m .",
    "second , the component of the reconstructed @xmath4 momentum perpendicular to the @xmath4 line - of - flight ( as determined from the primary and secondary vertex positions ) , @xmath71 , was required to be less than 0.35 gev/@xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath58 and @xmath29 decay tracks were required to be well - reconstructed in the silicon detectors and drift chambers .",
    "finally , the momentum asymmetry of the @xmath58 and @xmath29 as measured in the laboratory frame ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath72 ) was required to be less than 0.65 .",
    "this reduced the contribution from random track combinations , which tended to be asymmetric .",
    "the cuts for the @xmath73 case were similar in the initial stages .",
    "we used candidates arising from both 4-prong vertices and 3-prong vertices ( with an added track ) .",
    "the two vertex samples contributed roughly equal amounts to the signal .",
    "we required @xmath74 , @xmath75  @xmath61 m , @xmath76 gev/@xmath54 , and that the decay vertex was outside the target foils .",
    "the @xmath0 candidate mass was required to be in the range 1.7 - 2.0 gev/@xmath63 . to eliminate reflections from cabibbo - favored",
    "decays we examined the hypothesis that the kaon was actually a pion and one of the pions opposite in charge to the kaon was actually a kaon .",
    "since there are two such possibilities , candidate @xmath60 decays were rejected if either possibility yielded a candidate mass within 2@xmath65 of the @xmath19 mass .",
    "tracks were required to have momenta greater than 0.5 gev/@xmath54 and to have greater than @xmath77 of transverse separation from the primary vertex where @xmath65 is the measurement resolution on the separation . finally , the decay tracks were required to form a vertex that was no more than 2.5 cm downstream of the final target . beyond that point",
    "the silicon detectors and other material in the beam path provided large numbers of secondary interactions .    in the final stage of analysis , we used two - layer feed - forward neural networks to optimize the signal selection @xcite .",
    "specifically , we chose selection criteria that maximize @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 were the signal and the background under the signal for the right - sign decays . a vector , whose components are variables such as the ones just mentioned , was fed into each neural net as the input layer .",
    "each node in the next ( hidden ) layer computed the sigmoid of the sum of an offset and the inner product of the input vector with a weight vector .",
    "the results from this layer in turn formed the input for a single node in the final ( output ) layer .",
    "thus , the networks effectively combined information from each variable we would otherwise have `` cut '' on and provided a single output value in the range 0 to 1 . this output was monotonically related to the probability that a given candidate was signal and not background .    since our two major sources of background were false @xmath0 candidates and real @xmath0 candidates combined with random pions to produce fake @xmath81 candidates , we used separate neural networks to classify the @xmath0 and @xmath81 candidates .",
    "although there are only two modes of @xmath0 decay examined in this work , three @xmath0 samples were used to train the neural nets : one for the @xmath82 mode and two for the @xmath73 mode .",
    "the two separate @xmath73 samples contained candidates from vertices that had either all four or only three of the four tracks .    in order to minimize our dependence on monte carlo",
    ", we used @xmath0 candidates in our real data to train separate neural nets for each of the three samples .",
    "we chose @xmath0 candidates that do not combine with pions to give a @xmath81 candidate .",
    "the training sample is thus independent of our mixing sample and ensures that the neural net training was unbiased .",
    "a fourth neural net was trained using part of the right - sign @xmath83 sample to classify @xmath84 candidates .",
    "every net was trained using events in the peak region as `` signal '' and the remaining events as `` background '' .",
    "we selected only those events for which the product of the @xmath0 and @xmath81 net outputs was greater than a certain value rather than making individual `` cuts '' on many variables .    in the @xmath85 mode ,",
    "the net was presented with twelve input variables : the @xmath86 of the @xmath0 relative to the incident pion beam direction , the separation between the secondary and primary vertices ( @xmath87 ) , @xmath71 , @xmath70 , the @xmath88 per degree of freedom for the secondary vertex fit , the -based probability for the kaon to be a kaon , the momentum asymmetry ( @xmath89 ) , the consistency probability for the secondary vertex to be in a target foil , the track fit @xmath88 per degree of freedom for the two tracks and the number of tracking systems traversed by each of the two tracks .",
    "the two nets for the @xmath90 mode used seven variables , of which the first six variables were the same as the first six just listed for the @xmath85 mode .",
    "the seventh variable was the smallest contribution to the @xmath88 of the fit to the primary vertex from any of the four decay tracks .",
    "finally , the @xmath81 neural net was constructed using only five variables : the @xmath88 per degree of freedom for the track fit for the pion from the @xmath84 decay ( referred to hereafter as the `` bachelor pion '' ) , the number of tracking stations in which the pion is detected , the probability that it is not a fictitious track , its momentum and the @xmath88 per degree of freedom for the vertex fit of the @xmath0 and the bachelor pion .",
    "there were three nodes in the hidden layer for the @xmath91 and @xmath81 nets and four nodes in the hidden layers of each of the @xmath90 nets .",
    "although we considered many variables , we pruned the list down to the variables listed above and also pruned some of the connections to the hidden layer nodes when their contributions to the output were deemed unimportant using a technique called subset reduction , implemented as follows .",
    "nodes in a given layer were viewed as a linear array , one row for each event .",
    "the matrix thus formed was subjected to singular value decomposition using qrcp factorization@xcite .",
    "the `` energy content '' of the nodes was determined by the resulting eigenvalues @xcite . nodes with an",
    "`` energy content '' @xmath92 1%were deleted .",
    "we also tried other techniques for selecting events , including the more common method of using independent `` cuts '' in each variable and a binary decision tree ( bdt ) technique @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of the neural net technique was about 10%higher than the bdt in the @xmath62 mode and about 30%higher than the bdt in the @xmath73 mode ; in turn the bdt was better than the commonly used `` cuts '' technique .",
    "one further advantage of the neural net technique was that the output could be used to choose the best candidate in an event , should there be more than one ( a rare occurence ) .",
    "this simplified the statistical analysis in the fits to our data .",
    "the results of our neural net optimizations are shown in figure  [ fglego ] for right - sign and wrong - sign @xmath8 and @xmath60 final states . in this figure , we plot the candidate @xmath19 mass ( @xmath93 or @xmath94 ) ) versus @xmath95 , defined as @xmath96 or @xmath97 . for",
    "real @xmath3 decays , @xmath95 has a value of about 5.8 mev . in the right - sign plots ( top of figure  [ fglego ] ) ,",
    "clear signals are apparent over small backgrounds .",
    "the bands of events at @xmath93 or @xmath98 gev/@xmath63 are due to real @xmath19 decays combining with random pions in the event to give a false @xmath3 candidate .",
    "these bands are more readily seen in the wrong - sign plots ( bottom of figure  [ fglego ] ) where the vertical scale is expanded by a factor of 20 .",
    "this background , which we will refer to as `` random pion '' background , is the dominant one in our analysis .",
    "we will call the remaining broad background visible in the plots the `` false @xmath0 '' background .    in the right - sign plot for the @xmath8 mode",
    ", there is a signal of 5643 events above a background of 235 events . in the right - sign plot for the @xmath60 mode",
    ", there is a signal of 3469 events above a background of 146 events .",
    "the signals and backgrounds are estimated in a region spanning @xmath99 around the peak in @xmath95 , for @xmath100 gev/@xmath63 .",
    "the precise region used to estimate @xmath79 and @xmath80 is not important for the optimization .",
    "the resulting sensitivities ( @xmath101 ) for the two modes are 368 ( @xmath8 ) and 287 ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the process just described results in eight separate datasets : @xmath19 or @xmath20 , decaying to @xmath8 or @xmath60 , right - sign or wrong - sign decays .",
    "although it is possible for us to fit each data set separately ( which we have done as a check ) , it is useful to combine all eight data sets into a single fit .",
    "this allows us to take advantage of the fact that the central values of the @xmath4 and @xmath81 signals , as well as the @xmath102 , @xmath103 and q resolutions , are the same for the different data samples . under these circumstances , most of the parameters of the single fit ( which are largely parameters to describe background ) remain uncoupled , and in that sense are no different from eight separate fits . only the signal masses and resolutions are constrained across data samples .",
    "studies of separate fits for the different samples show no significant shifts from the single fit results and have convinced us that these constraints are valid .",
    "our most general fit includes no constraints beyond those just described , and is summarized in section [ sect_other ] and in table [ tbfitgen ] .",
    "however , as discussed in section [ sect_cp ] , the most likely scenario is that there is no cp violation in either the dcs or the pure mixing terms of the wrong - sign rates .",
    "this leads to three additional constraints , discussed at the end of this section , which then lead to the results of table [ tbfitlik ] .",
    "these results are the main focus of our studies in mixing . finally ,",
    "in section [ sect_other ] we perform other fits using additional physical restrictions ( no dcs  mixing interference , or no mixing at all ) in order to explore other physics hypotheses and to compare with previous measurements . in what follows",
    ", we describe the terms of the fit in detail .",
    "as stated , we perform a single unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the data , using the following form for the @xmath104 of the likelihood : @xmath105 }       + { [ n_{pred}^f - n_{obs}^f]^2\\over 2 n_{pred}^f}\\right ) ,      \\label{eqlike}\\ ] ] where the first sum is over all the @xmath3 candidates , the second sum is over the eight decays used in the analysis , @xmath106 represents the likelihood for each candidate , and @xmath107 is the observed number of candidates for each final state .",
    "the argument of the second sum is the logarithm of a normalized gaussian , and serves to constrain the number of candidates predicted by the fit , @xmath108 .",
    "there are three contributions to each @xmath106 : signal , random pions with real @xmath19 s , and random pions with false @xmath19 s .",
    "in addition , for the @xmath109 samples we include a contribution from misidentified @xmath110 and @xmath111 decays , which also contribute measurable background .",

    "the gaussian smearing integrals are performed analytically with a smearing width @xmath119 = 0.05 ps .",
    "the reconstruction efficiency @xmath125 is the first of three functions that must be modeled for the fit .",
    "it is desirable to measure this function using real data rather than using monte carlo simulation .",
    "fortunately , this can be accomplished with a sample of right - sign events .",

    "the reconstructed distribution is proportional to @xmath128 .",

    "the misidentification rates for these modes are similar to what was observed for the double misidentification above ( all misidentification is dominated by the selection criteria for the kaon candidate ) , while the misidentified masses ( in some cases after losing a neutral particle ) are well outside the signal region .",

    "figure  [ fgmixtime ] demonstrates how these correlations come about in a hypothetical case where the interference contribution approximately cancels the contribution from pure mixing .",
    "this plot demonstrates that even when the full time evolution deviates only slightly from the pure exponential form of dcs decays , a large contribution from mixing can be present if it is offset by a destructive interference contribution .",

    "table [ tbfitlik ] shows our primary results in the search for mixing .",
    "these results assume that cp violation can only occur in the interference terms of the fit , an assumption supported by most extensions to the standard model ( see the discussion in section [ sect_cp ] ) .",

    "we calculate the one - sided , 90% c.l .",
    "upper limits to be @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "we note that the earlier measurement by the e691 collaboration @xcite assumed that the interference terms @xmath176 were negligible .",
    "recently , there has been lively discussion concerning the validity of this assumption @xcite .",
    "although some authors suggest that the phase between dcs and mixing amplitudes may be small , and therefore that the interference terms @xmath176 should also be small , we prefer to quote our results without this constraint .",
    "nonetheless , to compare our measurements with the previous results from e691 , we have performed a fit in which we set the interference terms to zero .",
    "our results for mixing are @xmath203 , which is to be compared with the e691 result @xmath204 .",
    "the reduction of the fit errors from table  [ tbfitlik ] is indicative of the strong correlations with the @xmath176 parameters , which are now fixed at zero .",
    "e691 also touched on this point by considering several different fixed values of the interference term ( only one interference term was allowed in their model ) .",
    "their results showed behavior similar to what we see in our data : strong correlation between wrong - sign ratios , and reduced fit errors when fixing the interference term to zero .",
    "finally , we explore the possibility that mixing is completely negligible , as one would expect from purely standard model contributions . in this case",
    ", we fit only for the dcs terms , obtaining @xmath205 and @xmath10 .",
    "the result for @xmath141 demonstrates a two - sigma excess in the signal region which we believe is the result of real dcs decays .",
    "figure [ fgbkgsub ] shows this excess after background subtraction .",
    "we note that our value for the dcs rate is consistent with the cleo measurement @xcite for the total wrong - sign rate : @xmath206 .",
    "systematic uncertainties in the fit arise primarily from our modeling of the three functions @xmath125 , @xmath140 , and @xmath148 . by using the right - sign data samples to estimate these functions ,",
    "we have minimized our dependence on monte carlo models , but some uncertainty remains .",

    "we find that the systematic uncertainties in the analysis are small compared with the statistical errors from the fit .",

    "most of this uncertainty arises from our knowledge of the branching ratios for these modes .",
    "we have estimated this error as 20%  of the difference between the results of fits with and without terms describing these reflections .",
    "the uncertainties listed in the third row ( `` statistics of effy &  bkgd distrs '' ) result from the uncertainties in our estimates of @xmath125 , @xmath140 , and @xmath148 due to the finite size of our right - sign data sample .",
    "the error bars on the corresponding histograms in figures  [ fgefficiencies ] , [ fgr(q ) ] , and [ fgbcomb ] show the level of uncertainty involved . statistical uncertainties on the model of the function @xmath140 ( figure  [ fgr(q ) ] ) have been greatly reduced by combining each @xmath19 candidate with pions from many different events , so that the uncertainties in this histogram are negligible in comparison with the uncertainties of figures  [ fgefficiencies ] and [ fgbcomb ] . in order to propagate these statistical uncertainties to uncertainties on the fitted parameters ,",
    "we perform many fits to the data , modifying each bin in each of the histograms of @xmath125 , @xmath140 and @xmath148 by a gaussian fluctuation with resolution given by the error bars .",
    "the rms spreads of the fitted parameters from 25 such fits are given in table  [ tsyslik ] .",
    "the uncertainties listed in the fourth row of table  [ tsyslik ] ( `` binning of effy &  bkgd distrs '' ) are due to the fact that we have represented the @xmath125 , @xmath140 , and @xmath148 functions by binned histograms rather than smooth functions .",
    "we have , of course , tried to choose bin sizes small enough so that binning effects are not significant . in order to verify this claim , we replaced the histograms in the fit with smoothed functions which were derived from the histogram data , and repeated the fit .",
    "the differences between the parameter values with the smoothed functions and the parameter values with the histograms are quoted in table  [ tsyslik ] as the uncertainties due to binning .",
    "we expect this method to give an overestimate of the binning effect , since it also includes the effect of some statistical fluctuations in the measured histograms which are adjusted by the smoothing function . as anticipated , the binning effects are small .",
    "the uncertainties listed in the fifth row of the table ( `` time resolution '' ) are due to the resolution on the measured decay time .",
    "since the smearing is small , a good assumption is that @xmath125 is almost the same with and without smearing . for this analysis ,",
    "the most likely resolution on the decay time is about 0.03 ps , with some measurements having a resolution as large as 0.08 ps . in order to quantify the error due to smearing",
    ", we replace the functions of equation  ( [ bdef ] ) by functions convoluted with a fixed gaussian resolution : @xmath209 where @xmath125 is obtained as in section v and the integrals are obtained numerically .",
    "we then perform the fit with three different values for @xmath119 : 0.02 ps , 0.05 ps and 0.08 ps .",
    "we quote the average of the central value differences ( from the fits for 0.02 ps and 0.05 ps and from the fits for 0.08 ps and 0.05 ps ) as variations in table  [ tsyslik ] , line 5 .",
    "when the exponential lifetime is modified by our detector acceptance which is poor at low lifetimes , there is a `` peak '' at @xmath210 ps .",
    "we observe that the time smearing affects the likelihood most near this `` peak '' , while mixed events are most likely around higher values of decay time .",
    "consequently , the dcs ratios exhibit the largest variation , while the mixing ratio is relatively stable .",
    "the uncertainties in the sixth line of the table ( `` mass resolution '' ) come from the assumption of a constant gaussian resolution in @xmath93 and @xmath211 . in truth",
    ", the mass resolution should depend on the @xmath19 momentum and on the kinematics of the decay .",
    "we have studied the dependence on momentum and verified a noticable correlation between resolution and momentum . for the @xmath8 decay mode ,",
    "about 90% of the events have a mass resolution between 12 and 16 mev/@xmath63 , with a tail reaching out to about 25 mev/@xmath63 at high momentum . for the @xmath60 mode ,",
    "the variation is much smaller , with all events exhibiting a mass resolution in the range 8.5 to 11 mev/@xmath63 . to quantify this effect ,",
    "we have varied the mass resolutions @xmath212 mev/@xmath63 in the fit and recorded the maximum variations in wrong - sign ratios in table  [ tsyslik ] .",
    "the fit results are quite insensitive to variation of the resolution on @xmath211 , but change slightly with the resolution on @xmath93 .",
    "a change in @xmath93 resolution primarily affects @xmath213 , but because of the correlations in the fit , it will also alter @xmath12 and @xmath214 , as shown .",
    "some other assumptions and biases in our fit model bear further comment .",
    "first of all , we have assumed that the efficiency function @xmath125 for reconstructing a @xmath19 from a @xmath3 decay ( signal terms from eq .",
    "( [ eqwssig ] ) ) is the same as the efficiency function for reconstructing a primary @xmath19 ( random pion term from eq .",
    "( [ eqwsranpi ] ) ) . since our reconstruction and selection criteria",
    "are only weakly dependent on the @xmath19 production kinematics , we expect to find very little difference in efficiency for these two sources of @xmath4 mesons .",
    "studies of reconstructed @xmath19 decays which are _ not _ associated with a bachelor pion appear to confirm that the difference is negligible .",
    "secondly , the @xmath60 final state may result from different resonant substructures in the cabibbo - favored and dcs amplitudes .",
    "this can , in principle , lead to different efficiencies for the dcs and interference terms in the fit .",
    "( the two - body @xmath8 mode is , of course , immune to this problem . )",
    "once again however , the fact that our reconstruction depends only slightly on the decay kinematics leads to effects at the level of only 1% .",
    "the very similar time dependence of the efficiency functions for the @xmath8 and @xmath60 final states ( fig .  [ fgefficiencies ] ) demonstrates how little @xmath125 depends on the @xmath4 decay .",
    "we are also aware that training the @xmath3 neural net on a sample of right - sign @xmath3 decays can , in principle , produce a small bias in that sample ( but not the wrong - sign samples which were not used for training the net ) .",
    "careful selection of input variables for the neural net that are not correlated with @xmath95 ( our variables depend only on parameters that describe the bachelor pion ) should prevent any significant bias .",
    "we have investigated this effect by subdividing the training sample into 10 subsamples , training a neural net on one subsample , and applying the resulting net to the remaining samples as a test of the bias .",
    "we then repeat the process on each subsample to get a better statistical average . by comparing the sensitivity ( measured as @xmath78 ) of the training samples with the sensitivity of the test samples , we determine the level of bias .",
    "we find that the number of right - sign signal events could be biased upwards by about 1% .",
    "this is a negligible effect compared to our statistical error .",
    "the last line in table  [ tsyslik ] shows the contribution from all the systematic errors added in quadrature .",
    "these totals are less than half the size of the statistical errors in table  [ tbfitlik ] .",
    "at the current level of sensitivity , mixing searches begin to constrain some models@xcite .",
    "there are also other search methods that are promising .",
    "using the same @xmath3 decay chain to identify the produced @xmath4 meson , but looking at semileptonic decays of the @xmath4 , is one possibility .",
    "although semileptonic decays are harder to reconstruct due to missing neutrinos , they are not subject to contributions from dcs amplitudes , and therefore do not suffer from the main limitations discussed in this paper . in a separate publication",
    "we describe such a search @xcite with the result @xmath31 at the 90%  cl .",
    "the possibility exists for even higher statistics searches in future experiments .",
    "alternatively , it may be possible to detect mixing via the lifetime difference between the two physical eigenstates by comparing the measured lifetimes for different cp final states @xcite . of course",
    ", this approach will only detect mixing if it is associated with a substantial lifetime difference as opposed to mixing that only results from a mass difference .",
    "we are investigating this method as well .",
    "finally , the cleanest signal for mixing might be found at a @xmath215-charm factory which produces 0d0bar  pairs on resonance . as has been discussed previously @xcite , certain hadronic final states from these 0d0bar  pairs",
    "can only be produced by mixing and not by dcs amplitudes .",
    "we remain hopeful that one of these techniques may be used to detect , and thus provide information about the existence of new physics .",
    "we have searched for evidence of  and dcs decays by looking for wrong - sign decays in the decay chain @xmath216 with @xmath217 or @xmath218 .",
    "our results are summarized in table  [ tbsumm ] .",
    "we have seen no evidence for mixing in either @xmath0 decay mode .",
    "the results of a maximum likelihood fit to the data are given in table  [ tbfitlik ] .",
    "the possibility of additional sources of wrong - sign decays from dcs amplitudes limits our sensitivity for detecting mixing alone . using the criterion @xmath185",
    ", we calculate the one - sided , 90% c.l .",
    "upper limit to be @xmath219 .",
    "if , in order to account for the most general case possible , we relax the assumption that cp is conserved in the mixing and dcs terms of the fit ( as in table  [ tbfitgen ] ) , we calculate the upper limits for mixing to be @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "our quoted sensitivity to mixing is similar to that of fermilab e691 , but our analysis is notably more general in its assumptions concerning dcs - mixing interference and cp violation . assuming no dcs - mixing interference constrains the mixing and dcs contributions much more severely , but we do not feel this assumption is justifiable .",
    "nevertheless , for comparison we include the mixing results for this case in table [ tbsumm ] .",
    "all our results for the @xmath8 final state are also consistent with the cleo measurement of @xmath206 @xcite for wrong - sign decays .",
