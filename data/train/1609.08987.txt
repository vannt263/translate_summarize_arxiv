    "the long - standing ( 34)@xmath5 discrepancy between the experimental value of the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath6 and the standard model ( sm ) prediction ,  @xcite , has been considered during these years as one of the most intriguing indications of physics beyond the sm . however , the accuracy of the sm prediction , @xmath7 , is limited by strong interaction effects , which can not be computed perturbatively at low energies . long time ago , by using analyticity and unitarity , it was shown @xcite that the leading - order ( lo ) hadronic contribution to the muon @xmath4 - 2 , @xmath8 , could be computed via a dispersion integral of the hadron production cross section in @xmath9 annihilation at low - energy . the present error on @xmath8 , @xmath10 , with a fractional accuracy of 0.6% ,",

    "such a beam is currently available at the cern north area  @xcite , and a preliminary detector layout is described in the following section .",
    "in order to perform the planned measurement to the required precision , a dedicated detector is necessary . we describe here a possible setup to measure the following observables :    * direction and momentum of the incident muon ; * directions of the outgoing electron and muon .",
    "the cern muon beam m2 , used at 150 gev , has the characteristics needed for such a measurement .",
    "the beam intensity appears to be adequate to provide the required event yield .",
    "the beam time structure allows to tag the incident muon while keeping low the background related to incoming particles ( _ e.g. _ electrons ) .",
    "the electrons contamination is very small .",
    "the beam provides both positive and negative muons , which we plan to use .",
    "the target consists of atomic electrons . to reach the required statistics ,",
    "the target must consist of an adequate amount of material to give a sufficient number of electron scattering centres .",
    "the target has to be made of a low-_z _ material to minimize the impact of multiple scattering and the background due to bremsstrahlung and pair production processes . a promising idea for",

    "the arrangement provides both a distributed target with low-_z _ and the tracking system . as downstream particle identifiers we plan to use a calorimeter for the electrons and a muon system for the muons ( a filter plus active planes )",
    "this particle identifier system is required to solve the muon - electron ambiguity for electron scattering angles around ( 23 )  mrad ( @xmath81 . fig .",
    "[ giovanni ] ) .",
    "the preliminary studies of such an apparatus , performed by using geant4 , indicate an angular resolution for the outgoing particles of  @xmath82  mrad .",
    "the detector acceptance must cover the region of the signal , with the electron emitted at extremely forward angles and high energies , as well as the normalization region , where the electron has much lower energy ( around 1 gev ) and an emission angle of some tens of mrad .",
    "the boosted kinematics of the process allows the detector to cover almost 100% of the acceptance .",
    "the incoming muons have to be tagged and their direction and momentum precisely measured . to this purpose ,",
    "a detector similar to those used by compass  @xcite or na62  @xcite can be employed .",
    "significant contributions of the hadronic vacuum polarization to the @xmath0 differential cross section are essentially restricted to electron scattering angles below 10 mrad , corresponding to electron energies above 10 gev .",
    "the net effect of these contributions is to increase the cross section by a few per mille : a precise determination of @xmath8 requires not only high statistics , but also a high systematic accuracy , as the final goal of the experiment is equivalent to a determination of the differential cross section with @xmath8310 ppm systematic uncertainty at the peak of the integrand function ( @xmath81 . fig .",
    "[ xfunction ] ) .    such an accuracy can be achieved if the efficiency is kept highly uniform over the entire @xmath39 range , including the normalization region , and over all the detector components .",
    "this motivates the choice of a purely angular measurement : an acceptance of tens of mrad can be covered with a single sensor of modern silicon detectors , positioned at a distance of about one meter from the target .",
    "it has to be stressed that particle identification ( electromagnetic calorimeter and muon filter ) is necessary to solve the electron - muon ambiguity in the region below 5 mrad .",
    "the wrong assignment probability can be measured with the data by using the rate of muon - muon and electron - electron events .",
    "another requirement for reaching very high accuracy is to measure all the relevant contributions to systematic uncertainties from the data themselves . an important effect , which distinguishes the normalization from the signal region , is multiple scattering , as the electron energy in this region is as low as 1 gev .",
    "multiple scattering breaks the muon - electron two - body angular correlation , moving events out of the kinematic line in the 2d plot of fig .",
    "[ giovanni ] .",
    "in addition , multiple scattering in general causes acoplanarity , while two - body events are planar , within resolution .",
    "these facts allow multiple scattering effects to be modelled and measured by using data .",
    "an additional handle on multiple scattering could be the inclusion of a thin layer in the apparatus , made of the same material as the main target modules .",
    "this possibility will be studied in detail with simulation .    in experiments dedicated to high - precision measurements",
    ", several systematic effects can be explored within the experiment itself . in this respect",
    "the proposed modularity of the apparatus will help .",
    "a test with a single module could provide a proof - of - concept of the proposed methods .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the control of the systematic uncertainties requires the development of high - precision monte carlo tools , including the relevant radiative corrections to reach the needed theoretical precision . to this aim ,",
    "qed radiative corrections at leading - logarithmic level resummed at all orders of perturbation theory and matched to the exact @xmath84 correction ( as for instance implemented in the ` babayaga ` event generator  @xcite for bhabha scattering ) are mandatory , ensuring a theoretical precision at the level of @xmath85 on the differential cross section .",
    "moreover , by using the ratio of the cross sections in the signal and normalization regions , we expect that the theoretical uncertainties will be further reduced to the level of @xmath86 , due to partial cancellation of common radiative corrections .",
    "work is in progress to extend ` babayaga ` to @xmath87 scattering and to quantify the actual accuracy on the computation of the ratio of cross sections by means of dedicated monte carlo simulations .",
    "any further improvement in the theoretical accuracy would require the matching of qed resummation with exact two - loop corrections , which are not available at present for the @xmath87 process but are within reach .",
    "we presented a novel approach to determine the running of @xmath33 in the space - like region and @xmath1 , the leading hadronic contribution to the muon @xmath4 - 2 , by scattering high - energy muons on atomic electrons of a low-@xmath88 target through the process @xmath0 .",
    "the experiment is primarily based on a precise measurement of the scattering angles of the two outgoing particles as the @xmath39 of the muon - electron interaction can be directly determined by the electron ( or muon ) scattering angle .",
    "an advantage of the muon beam is the possibility of employing a modular apparatus , with the target subdivided in subsequent layers .",
    "a low-_z _ solid target is preferred in order to provide the required event rate , limiting at the same time the effect of multiple scattering as well as of other types of muon interactions ( pair production , bremsstrahlung and nuclear interactions ) .",
    "the normalization of the cross section is provided by the very same @xmath0 process in the low-@xmath39 region , where the effect of the hadronic corrections on the fine - structure constant is negligible .",
    "such a simple and robust technique has the potential to keep systematic effects under control , aiming to reach a systematic uncertainty of the same order as the statistical one . for this purpose",
    "a preliminary detector layout has been described . by considering a beam of 150  gev muons with an average intensity of @xmath89 muons",
    "/ s , currently available at the cern north area , a statistical uncertainty of @xmath3 can be achieved on @xmath1 in two years of data taking .",
