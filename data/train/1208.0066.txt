    "the co@xmath0 laser emits infrared radiation ( the wavelength @xmath1 is 10.6 micron ) .",
    "the thin wire was mounted using crosswires in vertical planes at each end .",
    "each crosswire consisted of two mutually orthogonal thin nickel wires ( length  about 60 mm , diameter  50 micron ) .",
    "the wires were placed at @xmath2 to the vertical .",
    "the horizontal wire was placed upon these crosswires and had to be pulled taut to ensure its stability in the course of heating .",
    "previously , a different wire mounting method was used ( see the previous version of this preprint ) .",

    "thus , the experimental results are in qualitative agreement with the theoretical predictions derived for gaussian beams .",
    "it should be emphasized that the efficiency achieved in the experiment is quite high , as the measured width of the beam s waist ( 1.2 mm at 1/e intensity level ) is two orders of magnitude greater than the wire diameter ( 20 micron ) .",
    "the exact cause of the nonlinearity ( significant dependence of the absorption efficiency on the beam power ) has not been established yet , but wire elongation due to heating is a candidate , as it could dramatically decrease absorption efficiency at higher beam power levels : while this elongation was small for the temperature increase in the experiment , it could lead to wire sagging by several millimeters . as a result , the wire could move out of the beam , at least partially . to avoid this",
    ", the wire was connected to a spring at one end to provide compensation of the elongation .    the incident gaussian beam",
    "was modeled by an exact solution of the maxwell equations in free space ( equations 176 - 178 of ref .",
    "@xcite , version 1 ) .",
    "this solution describes a circularly polarized beam , but it was used for the linearly polarized beam of the laser in this preliminary computation , as the results depend on polarization very weakly in this geometry . the total power absorbed in the cylinder",

    "the results of the experiments demonstrate the feasibility of efficient heating of thin cylindrical targets with a coaxial electromagnetic beam with a waist width several orders of magnitude greater than the diameter of the target . to this end",
