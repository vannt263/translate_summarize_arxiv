    "observations of circumstellar accretion disks around young stars provide fundamental constraints on the processes of star and planet formation .",
    "such studies are facilitated by the identification of large , representative samples of disk - bearing members of star - forming regions .",
    "the most obvious signature of a disk around a young star is the presence of emission at infrared ( ir ) wavelengths in excess above that expected from a stellar photosphere .",
    "one approach to applying this diagnostic has been to obtain mid - ir photometry ( @xmath2 - 20  ) for known members of star - forming regions @xcite . however , the resulting sample of stars is biased by the selection criteria that were originally used to discover those objects . for instance , stars that are heavily obscured by edge - on disks , protostellar envelopes , or molecular clouds are mostly absent from optically - selected samples of young stars .",
    "alternatively , wide - field mid - ir images of star - forming regions can be used to search for stars with disks in a relatively unbiased fashion .",
    "the feasibility of such surveys has steadily improved over the past two decades with advances in ir telescopes and detectors . the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) imaged most of the sky in four mid- and far - ir bands , producing the first comprehensive census of disks around young stars .",
    "however , because of its low spatial resolution , _ iras _ was capable of resolving young stellar populations only in low - density regions like taurus @xcite .",
    "the better resolution and sensitivity of the _ infrared space observatory _",
    "( _ iso _ ) allowed it to extend mid - ir surveys to denser clusters and lower stellar masses , including a few brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "ground - based cameras equipped with large - format ir detector arrays have offered even higher spatial resolution @xcite , but are restricted to the shortest ir bands where excess emission from disks is smaller ( @xmath3 - 4  ) .    the _ spitzer space telescope _ @xcite offers the best available combination of field of view , sensitivity , spatial resolution , and wavelength coverage for identifying young stars with disks @xcite .",
    "the unique capabilities of _ spitzer _ have been applied to a large number of star - forming regions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* references therein ) .",
    "one of the primary objectives of these surveys is the extension of previous samples of disk - bearing stars to lower stellar masses . in an attempt to reach the lowest possible masses , _",
    "data have been used to search for new low - mass stars and brown dwarfs with disks in the nearest molecular clouds , including taurus @xcite , perseus @xcite , lupus @xcite , chamaeleon , and ophiuchus @xcite .",

    ", we present measurements of _ spitzer _ photometry for all known members of chamaeleon  i that appear in the latest images of the region .",

    "we consider all observations of this kind that have been performed in chamaeleon  i , most of which were reduced and analyzed by @xcite .",
    "the photometric catalog produced by @xcite is used for this study .",
    "the remaining observations of chamaeleon  i that were not examined by @xcite were obtained through the _ spitzer _ legacy program of l. allen , which has a program identification of 30574 . the astronomical observation request ( aor )",
    "identifications are 19986432 , 19992832 , 20006400 , 20012800 , 20014592 , and 20015104 for the irac observations and 19978496 , 19979264 , 20010240 , and 20011008 for the mips observations . the irac and mips images were collected on 2007 may 15 - 17 and 2007 april 5 and were processed with the spitzer science center ( ssc ) s16.1.0 and s16.0.1 pipelines , respectively .",
    "we combined the images produced by the ssc pipeline into mosaics using r. gutermuth s wcsmosaic idl package .",
    "we then identified all point sources appearing in the resulting mosaics using the iraf task starfind and measured aperture photometry for them using the iraf task phot .",
    "the details of these procedures are the same as those described by @xcite .",
    "the total exposure times for the irac and mips images at a given position were 41.6 and @xmath530  s , respectively .",
    "the boundaries of the irac and mips mosaics are indicated in the maps of chamaeleon  i in figure  [ fig : map ] . in a given filter ,",
    "the three irac mosaics cover areas of 0.10 , 0.20 , and 0.31  deg@xmath6 .",
    "the two mips mosaics at 24  encompass 1.4 and 0.71  deg@xmath6 .",
    "the irac and mips photometric measurements from these images for known members of chamaeleon  i are presented in the appendix .",
    "@xcite identified eight promising candidate members of chamaeleon  i in the _ spitzer _ images that they analyzed .",
    "those sources exhibit red irac and mips colors that are indicative of circumstellar disks and are located in the vicinity of known members of the star - forming region .",
    "the candidacy of one of these objects , 2mass  j11025374@xmath77722561 , is also supported by its optical and near - ir colors @xcite . to assess their membership , we selected for spectroscopy the six candidates that are bright enough for optical spectroscopy , consisting of 2mass j11020610@xmath77718079 , 2mass j11025374@xmath77722561 , cha j11062854@xmath77618039 , 2mass j11085367@xmath77521359 , + 2mass j11100336@xmath77633111 ( also known as ots  32 ) , and 2mass j11291470@xmath77546256 .",
    "we also performed spectroscopy on 2mass  j11095493@xmath77635101 , which was not discussed by @xcite .",
    "it is a promising candidate because of its red _ spitzer _ colors and its close proximity to young stars in the cederblad  112 reflection nebula . using the new _",
    "data from program 30574 that we have reduced in this work , we searched for possible young stars with disks with the same criteria that were employed by @xcite , namely @xmath8-[4.5]>0.15 $ ] , @xmath9-[8.0]>0.3 $ ] , and errors less than 0.1  mag in all four bands . from the resulting candidates",
    ", we selected 2mass j10533978@xmath77712338 and cha j11122701@xmath77715173 for spectroscopy .",
    "finally , we included in our spectroscopic sample 2mass j11091297@xmath77729115 , which is the remaining bright candidate member appearing in the optical and near - ir color - magnitude diagrams from @xcite .",
    "we obtained long - slit optical spectra of the 10 candidate members of chamaeleon  i that were selected in   [ sec : select ] using the low dispersion survey spectrograph ( ldss-3 ) on the magellan  ii telescope on the nights of 2007 december 17 and 18 .",
    "the spectra were taken through a 1.1@xmath10 slit .",
    "the instrument was operated with the vph all and vph red grisms on the first and second nights , respectively , resulting in spectral resolutions of 10 and 5.5    at 7500   .",
    "all data were obtained with the slit rotated to the parallactic angle .",
    "after bias subtraction and flat - fielding , the spectra were extracted and calibrated in wavelength with arc lamp data .",
    "the spectra were then corrected for the sensitivity functions of the detectors , which were measured from observations of a spectrophotometric standard star .",
    "we now examine the ldss-3 spectra for the evidence of youth that is expected for members of chamaeleon  i. the spectrum of 2mass  j11291470@xmath77546256 exhibits emission lines that are indicative of a galaxy . although the signal - to - noise ratio of its data is low ,",
    "we conclude that cha  j11122701@xmath77715173 is probably a background source rather than a low - mass member of the cluster based on the relatively blue slope and absence of late - type spectral features in its spectrum .",
    "the remaining eight candidates do show spectral signatures of young objects , such as strong h@xmath11 emission and weak na  i and k  i absorption lines .",
    "we also detect he  i emission at 6678    from 2mass  j11085367@xmath77521359 and ca  ii emission from ots  32 and cha  j11062854@xmath77618039 .",
    "therefore , we classify these eight objects as members of chamaeleon  i. the evidence of youth and membership is compiled in table  [ tab : new ] . when these new members are combined with the membership lists from @xcite and @xcite , the resulting census of chamaeleon  i contains 237 sources .    to measure spectral types for the eight new members ,",
    "we have compared their spectra to data for late - type members of chamaeleon  i and other star - forming regions @xcite , which were originally classified at optical wavelengths through comparison to averages of dwarfs and giants @xcite .",
    "the resulting classifications are presented in table  [ tab : new ] .",
    "the spectra are shown in order of spectral type in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "the spectral type for cha  j11062854@xmath77618039 is more uncertain than those of the other objects . a reasonable match to its spectrum",
    "is produced by both m8 with @xmath12 and l0 with @xmath13 .",
    "the latter agrees somewhat better with the data , but a spectrum with a higher signal - to - noise ratio in the tio band near 7200    is needed for a definitive classification .",
    "a spectral type of l0 would make cha  j11062854@xmath77618039 tied with cha j11070768@xmath77626326 @xcite as the coolest known member of chamaeleon  i.",
    "to examine the properties of the eight new members of chamaeleon  i , we begin by estimating their extinctions , effective temperatures , bolometric luminosities , and masses .",
    "extinctions were derived from the optical spectra during the process of spectral classification @xcite . we have converted our spectral types to effective temperatures with the temperature scale from @xcite .",
    "luminosities have been estimated from @xmath14-band photometry in the manner described by @xcite .",
    "because near - ir data are unavailable for cha  j11062854@xmath77618039 , we have estimated its @xmath14 magnitude by combining its 3.6  measurement with the average value of @xmath15 $ ] for late - type members of chamaeleon  i that do not have mid - ir excess emission @xcite . by doing so",
    ", we are assuming that the disk emission at 3.6  is negligible compared to the stellar photosphere , which is true for most brown dwarfs with disks @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath16 , @xmath14 , bc@xmath17 , and the distance modulus ( @xmath18 , 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.13 ) correspond to total uncertainties of @xmath19 in log  @xmath20 .",
    "the extinctions , temperatures , and luminosities for the new members of chamaeleon  i are listed in table  [ tab : new ] .",
    "we also include the available near - ir photometry for these objects .",
    "the temperatures and luminosities of the new members are plotted on a hertzsprung - russell ( h - r ) diagram in figure  [ fig : hr ] . for comparison ,",
    "we also show the previously known low - mass members of chamaeleon  i @xcite and the predictions of theoretical evolutionary models @xcite .",
    "the positions of the three coolest new members in figure  [ fig : hr ] are within the sequence of known members and are indicative of substellar masses .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , the precise value of the mass estimate for a young late - type object depends on whether it is derived from the temperature , the luminosity , or both .",
    "the five other new members have masses ranging from 0.1 to 0.55  @xmath1 according to the data and models in figure  [ fig : hr ] .",
    "however , three of these objects , ots  32 , 2mass j11095493@xmath77635101 , and 2mass j10533978@xmath77712338 , appear below the cluster sequence .",
    "the resulting isochronal ages ( @xmath21  myr ) are unrealistically old considering that these sources exhibit clear signatures of youth ( @xmath22  myr ) .",
    "these anomalously low luminosities may indicate that the stars are seen primarily in scattered light ( e.g. , edge - on disks ) at the shorter wavelengths from which the luminosities were estimated .",
    "indeed , we find that extended emission surrounds 2mass  j11095493@xmath77635101 in the near - ir images of chamaeleon  i obtained by @xcite , supporting this hypothesis . the nature of these sources is investigated further using their spectral energy distributions in   [ sec : sed ] .",
    "we note that ots  32 was originally identified as a possible member of chamaeleon  i through the detection of @xmath23-band excess emission @xcite .",
    "the faint near - ir magnitudes of this object were suggestive of a substellar mass , but as we have shown , it is probably a low - mass star based on its mid - m spectral type .      the spatial positions of some of the new members of chamaeleon  i merit discussion",
    ". two of these objects , ots  32 and 2mass  j11095493@xmath77635101 , are within the group of young stars toward the cederblad  112 reflection nebula , as shown in the optical and ir images in figure  [ fig : image ] .",
    "all of the 24  sources within that @xmath24 field are spectroscopically confirmed members of the cluster .",
    "two of the new members , 2mass  j11085367@xmath77521359 and 2mass  j10533978@xmath77712338 , are relatively far from the bulk of the stellar population of chamaeleon  i. the former is @xmath25 north of the cloud complex and is separated by @xmath26 from the proper motion members rx  j1108.8@xmath77519a and rx  j1108.8@xmath77519b @xcite and the latter is projected against a small cloudlet on the western edge of chamaeleon  i. finally , 2mass  j11091297@xmath77729115 is only @xmath27 from t39a and t39b .",
    "thus , these stars may comprise a triple system .",
    "all but one of the new members of chamaeleon  i were selected for spectroscopy in ",
    "[ sec : select ] based on red mid - ir colors that suggested the presence of circumstellar disks .",
    "we now examine the ir spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of these sources in more detail . to construct these seds",
    ", we use @xmath28-band photometry from @xcite , the third release of the deep near - infrared survey of the southern sky ( denis , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the magellan imacs images obtained by @xcite , near - ir photometry from 2mass and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see table  [ tab : new ] ) , and mid - ir measurements from irac and mips that are listed in table  6 from @xcite and in the appendix .",
    "the resulting seds for the new members are plotted in figure  [ fig : sed ] . to determine if long - wavelength excess emission is present , we compare each sed to an estimate of the sed of the stellar photosphere , which is composed of the average colors of diskless stars near the spectral type in question @xcite .",
    "the photospheric seds are reddened according to the extinctions in table  [ tab : new ] and the reddening laws from @xcite and @xcite and are normalized to the @xmath14-band fluxes of the new members , except for 2mass j11020610@xmath77718079 and cha  j11062854@xmath77618039 . because the available near - ir magnitudes of the former have large uncertainties , the normalization is performed with the average of the @xmath14 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 data . for cha",
    "j11062854@xmath77618039 , only irac and mips measurements are available",
    ". therefore , we scale its photospheric template to the flux at 3.6  .",
    "the emission from brown dwarfs with disks at this wavelength is usually dominated by the photosphere , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : par ] and illustrated in the seds for the other late - type objects in figure  [ fig : sed ] .",
    "as expected , the seven ir - selected members exhibit significant excess emission at long wavelengths relative to stellar photospheres .",
    "the remaining member , 2mass  j11091297@xmath77729115 , was identified as a candidate through optical and near - ir color - magnitude diagrams @xcite .",
    "its sed agrees well with that of a stellar photosphere and shows no evidence of disk emission . to characterize the seds quantitatively",
    ", we use spectral slopes defined as @xmath31  log@xmath32  log@xmath33 @xcite . as in @xcite , we compute slopes between four pairs of bands , 2.2 - 8 , 2.2 - 24 , 3.6 - 8 , and 3.6 - 24  .",
    "we deredden these slopes using the extinctions from table  [ tab : new ] and the reddening law from @xcite .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are presented in table  [ tab : alpha ] .",
    "we also include the equivalent widths of the h@xmath11 emission line measured from our spectra .",
    "we classify each object as class  i , flat - spectrum , class  ii , or class  iii by applying the thresholds from @xcite to the spectral slopes , which follows the standard classification scheme for seds of young stars @xcite .",
    "the sed classifications produced by @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 agree with each other for five sources , but not for ots  32 , 2mass  j11095493@xmath77635101 , and 2mass  j10533978@xmath77712338 . for the latter three objects ,",
    "the seds become redder with longer wavelengths such that the slopes ending at 8 and 24  indicate class  ii and flat / class  i , respectively .",
    "the distinctive behavior of these seds is indicative of stars that are occulted by circumstellar material , such as edge - on disks @xcite , which is consistent with the anomalously faint near - ir magnitudes of these objects (   [ sec : par ] ) .",
    "indeed , the shape of the sed of ots  32 closely resembles that of 2mass  j04381486 + 2611399 , which is a young brown dwarf in taurus that has an edge - on disk @xcite .",
    "thus , we tentatively classify ots  32 and 2mass  j10533978@xmath77712338 as class  ii sources with edge - on disks .",
    "because 2mass  j11095493@xmath77635101 exhibits a more steeply rising sed at 24  , it could be a class  i source . the absence of excess emission at @xmath38  relative to our estimate for its stellar photosphere may indicate the presence of an inner cavity in its disk and envelope .",
    "our sed classifications for the new members are provided in table  [ tab : alpha ] . because the new class  i and class  ii objects were identified as possible members based on evidence of disks , they should not be used in disk fraction measurements for chamaeleon  i unless they are encompassed by the completeness limits of another survey for members that is unbiased in terms of disks .",
    "we conclude with a few remarks concerning notable aspects of the eight new members of chamaeleon  i that we have identified .",
    "three of the new members have spectral types later than m6 , and thus are likely to be brown dwarfs . the current census of chamaeleon  i now contains 33 known members later than m6 .",
    "one of the new late - type members is classified as m8-l0 ; a type of l0 would make it one of the two coolest known members of the cluster and one of the least massive objects known to harbor a circumstellar disk .",
    "additional optical spectroscopy of this object is needed for a more definitive spectral classification .",
    "seven of our new members were identified as possible members based on red mid - ir colors that indicated the presence of disks . as noted in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] , a sensitive mid - ir survey of this kind is capable of finding disk - bearing young stars that are heavily obscured . for instance , because stars with edge - on disks are seen primarily in scattered light , they appear subluminous in optical color - magnitude diagrams and thus can be overlooked by optical surveys . indeed , three of the new members exhibit properties that are indicative of edge - on disks .",
    "high - resolution images and mid - ir spectroscopy are needed to determine if edge - on disks are present @xcite .",
    "one of the possible edge - on systems has a mass near the hydrogen burning mass limit according to its m5.75 spectral type and could be in the class  i stage based on its rising sed from 4.5 to 24  . in comparison , the coolest known class",
    "i candidates prior to this work were iras  04158 + 2805 , iras  04248 + 2612 , and iras  04489 + 3042 in taurus @xcite , which have optical spectral types of m5.25 , m4.5 , and m4 , respectively @xcite .",
