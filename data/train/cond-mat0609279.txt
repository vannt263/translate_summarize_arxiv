    "a local magnetic impurity changes the ground state of a fermi liquid due to the correlations created by the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between its localized spin and the delocalized electrons.@xcite at temperatures below the kondo temperature @xmath2 the spin of the magnetic impurity is screened by the formation of a singlet state with the conduction electrons.@xcite disorder affects the formation of this kondo singlet in various ways.@xcite in particular , the kondo temperature may depend on the positioning of the magnetic impurities in the host lattice .",
    "thus , for a sample containing many magnetic impurities , @xmath2 may be distributed due to fluctuations of the microscopic exchange coupling.@xcite impurities ( magnetic or nonmagnetic ) and lattice defects also cause fluctuations in the local density of states ( ldos ) of the conduction electrons at the magnetic impurity site .",
    "thus , the distributions of the kondo temperature and of the ldos are related in a disordered metal.@xcite    in this paper we explore the consequences of nonmagnetic disorder for the kondo effect .",
    "we base our study on the statistical properties of @xmath2 for the different dynamical regimes of a disordered metal .",
    "note that the kondo temperature accounts for a crossover rather than a sharp transition in the metal properties and that may raise the question whether @xmath2 is sufficiently well defined . in weakly disordered metals",
    "it is possible in principle to extract @xmath2 by fitting physical quantities such as the spin susceptibility and the electron dephasing rate versus temperature against the corresponding universal scaling function .",
    "while that scaling function may be modified itself by the disorder,@xcite the kondo screening is still governed by @xmath2 , and one may study its sample - to - sample fluctuations .",
    "below , we show that these fluctuations may have a significant impact on the low - temperature properties of a metallic sample even in the thermodynamic , infinite volume limit .",
    "it is useful to compare the magnitude of @xmath2 to other relevant energy scales of a metallic sample .",
    "these scales are the mean level spacing @xmath3 , the thouless energy @xmath4 , and the elastic scattering rate @xmath0 . here",
    ", @xmath5 denotes the density of states at the fermi level , @xmath6 is the diffusion constant , and @xmath7 is the dimensionality of diffusion ( we have set @xmath8 ) .",
    "this comparison allows one to establish several distinct regimes , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : kondoboxmap ] .",
    "we note that , in practice , @xmath2 does not exceed @xmath0 in metals , therefore standard perturbation theory in the disorder potential may not be used to describe the effect of disorder on the kondo effect .",
    "however , there is a large regime of experimental interest where a diagrammatic expansion may be used , namely , @xmath9.@xcite for small samples , when @xmath10 , random matrix theory ( rmt ) can be applied and the distribution of kondo temperatures is expected to scale with @xmath11 alone . in the opposite limit ,",
    "when the sample is so large that the localization length @xmath12 is smaller than the linear size @xmath13 , the thouless energy and the global level spacing are irrelevant and the kondo temperature is determined by the mean level spacing for states localized in the vicinity of the magnetic impurity , @xmath14.@xcite in this case , one can expect the distribution of kondo temperatures to scale with @xmath15 instead of @xmath11 . finally , when @xmath2 is smaller than the spacing between neighboring energy levels at the fermi surface ( either @xmath11 or @xmath15 ) , the distribution of @xmath2 will be mainly determined by the fluctuations of the wave functions and level spacing of the two eigenstates closest to the fermi energy . accordingly , in this regime the kondo temperature is determined by the coupling of the magnetic impurity to a two - level system ( 2ls ) .    , as parametrized by the system s mean level spacing @xmath16 and the unaveraged kondo temperature of a single magnetic impurity @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath17 is the thouless energy , @xmath0 is the elastic scattering rate , and @xmath18 , with @xmath12 being the localization length .",
    "the acronyms denote : two levels coupled to the magnetic impurity ( 2ls ) , diagrammatic expansion in diffusion ladder diagrams ( dd ) , and perturbative regime ( pt ) , with @xmath19 as the small expansion parameter .",
    "we only consider metallic systems where the relation @xmath20 is fulfilled.,width=226 ]    our analytical calculations show that the average kondo temperature is enhanced by weak disorder . disorder also induces a _ finite width _ in the distribution of @xmath2 which is shown to persist even in the infinite sample , thermodynamic limit .",
    "this effect is due to the existence of local correlations between eigenfunctions at different energies within a macroscopically large energy interval @xmath0 .",
    "these spectral correlations also lead to a bimodal structure in the distribution of @xmath2 , with a long tail stretching toward @xmath21 .",
    "the numerical simulations show that for a sizeable number of disorder configurations , no finite value of @xmath2 exist within the lowest order self - consistent perturbation theory , indicating that in those cases the magnetic moment is not screened by the conduction electrons .",
    "we find that there is a finite probability of having free moments even for values of @xmath22 such that the average kondo temperature @xmath23 is much larger than the mean level spacing @xmath11 .",
    "for small metallic grains , it is well - know that rmt provides a very good description of the statistical fluctuations of single - particle states .",
    "we therefore use rmt to investigate analytically and numerically the statistics of @xmath2 in such systems .",
    "the ratio between the standard deviations of @xmath2 for the orthogonal and unitary ensemble is found numerically to be equal to @xmath24 for a wide range of exchange couplings @xmath22 , in agreement with analytical calculations .",
    "furthermore , it is shown numerically that a finite number of free moments persists to exist in this regime .",
    "this result is consistent with an analytical calculation based on the 2ls approximation .    in regard to the width of the distribution of @xmath2 in the rmt regime",
    ", we find a counter - intuitive result at first glance , namely , that the distribution becomes _ narrower _ when increasing the concentration .",
    "this effect maybe understood as a consequence of the suppression of the weak localization correction by the breaking of time - reversal invariance , which in rmt is seen as a reduction in wave function fluctuations .",
    "we also consider whether additional correlations between wave functions induced by breaking of time - reversal symmetry@xcite within an interval of order of the spin scattering rate @xmath25 can lead to an enhancement of the width of the distribution of @xmath2 .",
    "we find that while the width increases by a factor @xmath26 as compared to the pure rmt ensembles , it nevertheless vanishes in the thermodynamic limit when @xmath27 , and therefore is negligible in comparison with the magnitude of the broadening caused by wave functions correlations beyond rmt .",
    "the large fluctuations of @xmath2 in disordered metals impact the behavior of several thermodynamic and transport properties at low temperatures .",
    "we consider in particular the influence of these fluctuations on the temperature dependence of the electron s dephasing rate .",
    "we find that nonmagnetic disorder combined with spin scattering due to magnetic impurities increases the dephasing rate at temperatures @xmath28 .",
    "the dephasing rate is readily accessible in transport experiments by measuring weak - localization corrections to the resistance .",

    "we will consider a single magnetic impurity in an isolated , phase - coherent metallic sample where the energy levels are well separated , a system previously referred in the literature as the kondo box.@xcite to determine @xmath2 , we will adopt the following self - consistent equation,@xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the number of states in the spectrum , @xmath32 is the sample volume , @xmath33 is the fermi energy , and @xmath22 is the exchange coupling between the magnetic impurity and the delocalized electrons .",
    "the eigenenergies and eigenfunctions of the sample are , respectively , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , while the impurity is located at @xmath36 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : tk ] ) is obtained from second - order perturbation theory in appendix [ sec : appendixa ] .",
    "a similar expression can be obtained from the zero - temperature , self - consistent solution of the one - loop renormalization group ( rg ) equation.@xcite however , in that case one misses the @xmath37 factor ( which accounts for the finite - temperature occupation numbers ) and the result is only valid for @xmath38 . while the approximations involved in deriving eq .",
    "( [ eq : tk ] ) are not sufficient for describing the properties of the system below @xmath2 , it is important to remark that eq .",

    "( [ eq : sctk ] ) , the distribution of kondo temperatures is determined by @xmath48 where @xmath49 we note that a similar expression appears in the calculation of the distribution of nmr - knight shifts for metallic grains with a finite level width @xmath50.@xcite there , an exact solution of the problem was derived within rmt in the limit @xmath51 .",
    "however , two aspects make the problem defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ptk ] ) much harder to solve .",

    "thus , the derivation of an exact , closed expression for the @xmath54 is very nontrivial , even in rmt .    in rmt , for @xmath55 , one would expect the distribution of kondo temperatures to be close to a gaussian .",
    "the reasoning behind that is the following . in this limit",
    "one can go back to eq .",
    "( [ eq : sctk ] ) , expand the @xmath37 factor and find that @xmath2 is given approximately by a sum of random variables ( the wave function amplitudes ) .",
    "the central - limit theorem then ensures that a gaussian distributed variable results from summing over independent random variables .",
    "however , as we show below , even for large @xmath56 one finds a non - gaussian behavior at the tails of the distribution .",
    "this feature is enhanced when considering disorder effects beyond rmt due to the appearance of local correlations between wave functions at different energies .",
    "it is therefore clear that in order to obtain the correct distribution of the kondo temperature in disordered metals , it is crucial to abandon the assumption of independent random wave functions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sctk ] ) .",
    "the main effect of wave function correlations is to broaden the distribution of @xmath2 .",
    "this broadening survives the large - volume limit . in sec .",

    "this should be compared with the rather featureless distribution obtained when one uses uncorrelated rmt wave functions amplitudes to evaluate @xmath2.@xcite    for reference , the behavior of the kondo temperature in the clean limit is discussed in appendix [ sec : clean ] .",
    "the effect of nonmagnetic disorder on the statistical fluctuations of the kondo temperature is a difficult problem to study analytically .",
    "however , in the weak - disorder limit it is possible to derive expressions for the average and standard deviations of @xmath2 _ beyond rmt _ by taking explicitly into account wave function correlations . to this end",

    "note that the correlation is stronger when time - reversal symmetry is present ( @xmath74 ) .",

    "this is the subject of ongoing work and will be published elsewhere.@xcite on the experimental side , the relevance of the distribution of the kondo temperature to the low - temperature anomaly of the dephasing rate could be established by utilizing samples with lower diffusion constants , such as the low - mobility samples of aupd , examined in ref .",

    "these have diffusion constants as low as @xmath342 @xmath335/s , corresponding to @xmath343 .",
    "the presence of free magnetic moments would be facilitated in semiconductors such as si and gaas where the effective mass of electrons is smaller than in metals by a factor 30 . moreover ,",

    "anderson localization has been observed even in wires with @xmath345.@xcite thus , all mesoscopic energy scales can become relevant when the system reaches temperatures of the order of 1 k. however , so far no magnetic impurities with detectable kondo temperatures have been found in semiconductors , since the low density of states suppresses the kondo temperature exponentially .",
    "the screening of magnetic moments in metals , the kondo effect , is found to be quenched with a finite probability in the presence of nonmagnetic disorder . for weak disorder , @xmath157 ,",
    "the effect is shown analytically and numerically to be due to wave function correlations .",
    "albeit weak in the metallic regime , these correlations have a sizeable effect on the kondo temperature . that is because the kondo temperature involves a summation over all eigenstates with a finite wave function amplitude at the location of the magnetic impurity . as disorder increases and the sample goes from the diffusive to the localized regime ,",
    "an increase in the correlations of the ldos at different energies induces even stronger fluctuations in the kondo temperature .",
    "thus , the distribution of the kondo temperature @xmath54 retains a finite width in the limit of vanishing level spacing @xmath11 .",
    "when time - reversal symmetry is broken either by applying a magnetic field or by increasing the concentration of magnetic impurities , @xmath54 becomes narrower .",
    "the probability that a magnetic moment remains free down to the lowest temperatures is found to increase with disorder strength .",
    "this result is consistent with direct measurements of kondo effect in cu(fe ) thin films and au(fe ) wires.@xcite    we have also shown that magnetic impurities with a small kondo temperature are shown to modify the temperature dependence of the dephasing rate at low temperatures , @xmath346 , as measured in weak - localization transport experiments .",
    "equations ( [ eq : lntk ] ) and ( [ eq : lntkq1d ] ) allow us to conclude that the disorder can substantially affect the kondo temperature . this could be contrasted with the effect of disorder on another energy scale derived from a many - body state , namely , the critical temperature of a superconductor , @xmath347 .",
    "anderson s theorem states that @xmath347 is not affected by nonmagnetic disorder.@xcite our results demonstrate that there is no analog to this theorem for the kondo temperature of magnetic impurities embedded in low - dimensional disordered systems since the variance of @xmath2 depends markedly on the disorder strength .",
    "this conclusion , however , is at odds with the proposal of ref . , where it was argued that in the low - temperarature , strong coupling limit , the kondo effect is not affected by disorder at all .",
    "we note that this result was obtained using a path integral representation and a semiclassical expansion ( the large-@xmath31 limit is taken , where @xmath348 is the number of spin components ) . the disagreement between ref . and our results may not be real , however , since their calculation is limited to @xmath40 and can not rule out the existence of magnetic impurities with exceedingly small @xmath2 .",
    "it remains to be studied how the distribution of @xmath2 scales with system size and how it changes ( if at all ) in the quasi - one - dimensional limit .",
    "the numerical techniques employed in this work did not permit the investigation of sufficiently large lattices .",
    "it also remains to be checked whether the large fluctuations of @xmath2 seen at strong disorder survive a non - perturbative approach such as the numerical renormalization group .",
