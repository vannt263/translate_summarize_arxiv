    "event - by - event analysis of high - energy nuclear collisions has been performed to understand transport properties of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "higher order harmonics of collective flow is intimately related with initial state fluctuation in nucleus - nucleus ( a+a ) collisions @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , the system created in high multiplicity proton - nucleus ( p+a ) events also exhibits collective behaviour @xcite .",
    "these can be described by conventional hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "however , the apparent success of hydrodynamics in such small systems has been questioned since the hydrodynamics poses on a condition of gradually changing thermodynamic variables in both time and space direction for its validity .",
    "motived by these facts , we extended the conventional hydrodynamic framework by introducing causal hydrodynamic fluctuations @xcite .",
    "within framework of the relativistic fluctuating hydrodynamics , we discuss multiplicity fluctuation caused by noises during hydrodynamic evolution of the quark - gluon fluid created in high - energy nuclear collisions .",
    "we first discuss the stochastic equations for dissipative currents coupled with the temporal evolution equation for the energy density in one - dimensionally expanding coordinate system @xcite to demonstrate that the final entropy fluctuates from event to event for a given initial condition .",
    "we next discuss the fluctuation theorem in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "we finally discuss consequences of hydrodynamic fluctuations on final multiplicity .",
    "to demonstrate the time evolution of the qgp in high - energy nuclear collisions under hydrodynamic fluctuations , we introduce an one - dimensionally expanding coordinate system and assume boost invariant scaling ansatz @xcite . in bjorken coordinates @xmath0)$ ] , relativistic hydrodynamic equations reduce to @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is energy density , @xmath3 is hydrostatic pressure , @xmath4 is temperature , @xmath5 is entropy density , @xmath6 is bulk pressure and @xmath7 is shear stress tensor . in the case of perfect fluids , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath8 , the entropy @xmath9 in a fluid element is conserved . in the case of dissipative fluids , it is easy to show @xmath10 thus the production rate of the entropy in one fluid element becomes @xmath11 in relativistic fluctuating hydrodynamics @xcite , the constitutive equations in the differential form are @xmath12 here @xmath13 and @xmath14 are relaxation times , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are shear and bulk viscosities and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are gaussian white noises for shear and bulk pressure , respectively .",
    "it is worthwhile mentioning that the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : entropyprod ] ) is _ not _ positive definite due to the existence of noises in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eom_shear ] ) and ( [ eq : eom_bulk ] ) . in the conventional hydrodynamic framework ,",
    "constitutive equations are so designed to obey the second law of thermodynamics . on the other hand , stochastic constitutive equations are obtained in fluctuating hydrodynamic framework so that solutions of these equations obey the fluctuation - dissipation relation by taking an ensemble average .",
    "after the linear response theory was established @xcite , a variety of progress has been made in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics . among them",
    ", the fluctuation theorem @xcite has become a milestone in that field .",
    "since the fluctuation theorem contains the green - kubo formula at long - time limit , it is believed to capture some important properties of non - equilibrium processes away from equilibrium . as seen in the previous section",
    ", entropy production can be negative in a certain sample event .",
    "interestingly , the probability for the system having negative entropy production can be quantified through the fluctuation theorem shown below .",
    "@xmath19 is supposed to be the production rate of entropy and @xmath20 is its average over time duration @xmath21 .",
    "a relation between a probability of @xmath22 and the one of @xmath23 holds as @xmath24 equations  ( [ eq : tft ] ) and ( [ eq : ssft ] ) are called `` transient fluctuation theorem '' and `` steady state fluctuation theorem '' , respectively . for details ,",

    "here @xmath27 denotes an ensemble average .",
    "thus entropy distribution at time @xmath21 is @xmath28 =   \\exp\\left [ -\\frac{(s- \\langle s \\rangle)^2}{2 ( \\sqrt{2 \\langle\\bar{\\sigma } \\rangle t})^2}\\right],\\ ] ] so far , the above results have been obtained in general under the fluctuation theorem .",
    "now we focus on the bjorken expansion case discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : fh ] . relative width of entropy distribution at time @xmath29 ( being sufficiently larger than the relaxation time @xmath30 ) becomes @xmath31 here @xmath32 is initial time , @xmath33 is initial entropy density and @xmath34 is average entropy production per volume of local thermal system @xmath35 . in heavy ion collisions ,",
    "the number of independent local thermal system in the transverse plane can be estimated as @xmath36 . here",
    "@xmath37 is the effective transverse area of collision geometry for a given impact parameter @xmath38 .",
    "finally relative fluctuation for total entropy per space - time rapidity window @xmath39 becomes @xmath40 from the first line to the second line in eq .",
    "( [ eq : entropyfluctuation ] ) , we utilise an inequality @xmath41 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "this result suggests fluctuation of total entropy is bounded by a value evaluated solely from the initial entropy .",
    "+    it turns out that entropy fluctuation per rapidity window @xmath39 depends on a factor @xmath44 .",
    "figure [ fig : cent_dep ] shows @xmath45 as a function of impact parameter @xmath38 by assuming @xmath46 corresponds to overlap area of collisions of two nuclei with a radius of 6 fm .",
    "the factor @xmath45 gradually increases with @xmath38 but rapidly enhances in peripheral collisions @xmath47-@xmath48 fm . identifying inelastic cross section of p+p collisions at rhic and the lhc with the above transverse area @xmath46 , @xmath49-@xmath50 @xmath51 .",
    "these values are comparable with the ones in peripheral a+a collisions . as expected , the effects of entropy fluctuation manifest in small system .",
    "entropy and , in turn , multiplicity fluctuate from event to event due to hydrodynamic fluctuation of dissipative currents such as shear stress tensor and bulk pressure even if the initial state is the same in a macroscopic sense .",
    "although _ event - averaged _ entropy has to increase with time so that the system obeys the second law of thermodynamics , entropy in a certain event can , however , _ decrease _ with time temporarily and locally due to the hydrodynamic fluctuations .",
    "the probability of decreasing entropy during hydrodynamic evolution is tiny in general . nevertheless , the probability is quantified by the fluctuation theorem as known in the non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "the multiplicity fluctuation caused by hydrodynamic noise must play a crucial role in small system such as in peripheral a+a and/or in high multiplicity p+a and p+p events .",
