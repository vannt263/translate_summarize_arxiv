    "a partition of @xmath2 is a monotone sequence @xmath3 of nonnegative integers with sum @xmath2 .",
    "the number @xmath2 is denoted @xmath4 and called the size of @xmath5 . a geometric object associated to a partition is its _ diagram _ ; it contains @xmath6 squares in the first row , @xmath7 squares in the second row and so on .",
    "an example , flipped and rotated by @xmath8 can be seen in figure [ partition ] .    partitions naturally label many basic objects in mathematics and physics , such as e.g.  conjugacy classes and representations of the symmetric group @xmath9 , and very often appear as modest summation ranges or indices . a simple but fruitful change of perspective , which i wish to stress here , is to treat sums over partitions probabilistically , that is , treat them as expectations of some functions of a random partition .",
    "a survey of the theory of random partitions may be found in @xcite . of the several natural measures on partitions ,",
    "the plancherel measure @xmath10 stands out as the one with deepest properties and widest applications . here",
    "@xmath11 is the dimension of the corresponding representation of @xmath9 .",
    "this is a probability measure on partitions of @xmath2 .",
    "it can be viewed as a distinguished discretization of the gue ensemble of the random matrix theory .",
    "namely , a measure on partitions can be made a point process on a lattice by placing particles in positions @xmath12 figure [ partition ] illustrates the geometric meaning of this transformation .",
    "an important theme of recent research was to understand how and why for a plancherel random partition of @xmath13 the particles @xmath14 behave like the eigenvalues of a random hermitian matrix .",
    "see @xcite and e.g.  @xcite for a survey .    in these notes ,",
    "we consider a different problem , namely , the behavior of in a _ periodic potential _ , that is , additionally weighted by a multiplicative periodic function of the particles positions .",
    "this leads to new phenomena and new applications .",
    "as we will see , the partition function of @xmath15 in a periodic potential is closely related to nekrasov partition function from supersymmetric gauge theory .",
    "this relationship will be reviewed in detail in section [ sgau ] and its consequences may be summarized as follows .      in 1994 ,",
    "seiberg and witten proposed an exact description of the low - energy behavior of certain supersymmetric gauge theories @xcite . in spite of the enormous body of research that this insight has generated ,",
    "only a modest progress was made towards its gauge - theoretic derivation .",
    "this changed in 2002 , when nekrasov proposed in @xcite a physically meaningful and mathematically rigorous definition of the regularized partition function @xmath16 for supersymmetric gauge theories in question .",
    "supersymmetry makes the gauge theory partition function the partition function of a _ gas of instantons_. nekrasov s idea was to use _ equivariant integration _ with respect to the natural symmetry group in lieu of a long - distance cut - off for the instanton gas .",
    "he conjectured that as the regularization parameter @xmath17 @xmath18 where the free energy @xmath19 expressed by the seiberg - witten formula in terms of periods of a certain differential @xmath20 on a certain algebraic curve @xmath21 .",
    "this conjecture was proven in 2003 by nekrasov and the author for a list of gauge theories with gauge group @xmath22 , namely , pure gauge theory , theories with matter fields in fundamental and adjoint representations of the gauge group , as well as @xmath23-dimensional theory compactified on a circle @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , independently , and using completely different ideas , the formal power series version of nekrasov s conjecture was proven for the pure @xmath22-theory by nakajima and yoshioka @xcite .",
    "the methods of @xcite were applied to classical gauge groups in @xcite and to the 6-dimensional gauge theory compactified on a torus in @xcite .",
    "another algebraic approach , which works for pure gauge theory with any gauge group , was developed by braverman @xcite and braverman and etingof @xcite .    in these notes",
    ", we outline the results of @xcite in the simplest , yet fundamental , case of pure gauge theory . as should be obvious from the title , the main idea is to treat the gauge theory partition function @xmath16 as the partition function of an ensemble of random partitions .",
    "the @xmath17 limit turns out to be the _ thermodynamic limit _ in this ensemble .",
    "what emerges in this limit is a nonrandom _ limit shape _ , an example of which may be seen in figure [ limshape ] .",
    "this is a form of the law of large numbers , analogous , for example , to wigner s semicircle law for the spectrum of a large random matrix .",
    "the limit shape is characterized as the unique minimizer @xmath24 of a certain convex functional @xmath25 , leading to @xmath26 we solve the variational problem explicitly and the limit shape turns out to be an algebraic curve @xmath21 is disguise .",
    "namely , the limit shape is essentially the graph of the function @xmath27 where @xmath20 is the seiberg - witten differential .",
    "thus all ingredients of the answer appear very naturally in the proof .",
    "random matrix theory and philosophy had many successes in mathematics and physics . here",
    "we have an example when random partitions , while structurally resembling random matrices , offer several advantages .",
    "first , the transformation into a random partition problem is geometrically natural and exact .",
    "second , the discretization inherent in partitions regularizes several analytic issues . for further examples along these lines the reader may consult @xcite .",
    "the translation of the gauge theory problem into a random partition problem is explained in section [ sgau ] . in section [ spar ] , we analyze the latter problem , in particular , derive and solve the variational problem for the limit shape . section [ shigh ] summarizes parallel results for @xmath28-dimensional partitions , where similar algebraic properties of limit shapes are now proven in great generality .",
    "the surprising fact that free energy @xmath19 is given in terms of periods of a hidden algebraic curve @xmath21 is an example of _ mirror symmetry_. a general program of interpreting mirror partners as limit shapes was initiated in @xcite .",
    "known results about the limit shapes of periodically weighted @xmath28-dimensional partitions , together with the conjectural equality of gromov - witten and donaldson - thomas theories of projective algebraic @xmath28-folds @xcite can be interpreted as a verification of this program for toric calabi - yau @xmath28-folds .",
    "see @xcite for an introduction to these ideas .",
    "note that something completely different is expected to happen in dimensions @xmath29 , where the behavior of both random interfaces and gromov - witten invariants changes qualitatively .",
    "we begin by recalling some basic facts , see @xcite for an excellent mathematical treatment and @xcite for a physical one .",

    ". a parallel treatment of certain matter fields can be found in @xcite .",
    "our goal is to study as function of the parameter @xmath41 ( and boundary conditions at infinity , see below ) .",
    "a head - on probabilistic approach to this problem would be to make it a theory of many interacting random matrices through a discretization of space - time .",
    "this is a fascinating topic about which i have nothing to say . in a different direction ,",
    "when @xmath42 , the minima of @xmath35 should dominate the integral . in _ supersymmetric _ gauge theory , there is a way to make such approximation exact , thereby reducing the path integral to the following finite - dimensional integrals .",
    "local minima of @xmath35 are classified by a topological invariant @xmath43 , @xmath44 called _ charge _ , and satisfy a system of first order pdes @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the hodge star operator on @xmath47-forms on @xmath33 .",

    "the asd equations are conformally invariant and can be transported to a punctured @xmath1-sphere @xmath50 via stereographic projection . from the removable singularities theorem of uhlenbeck",
    "it follows that any instanton on @xmath33 extends , after a gauge transformation , to an instanton on @xmath51 .",
    "thus we can talk about the value of an instanton at infinity .",
    "let @xmath52 be the group of maps @xmath53 such that @xmath54 .",
    "modulo @xmath52 , instantons on @xmath51 with @xmath55 are parametrized by a smooth manifold @xmath56 of real dimension @xmath57 .",
    "naively , one would like the contribution from charge @xmath2 instantons to to be the volume of @xmath56 in a natural symplectic structure . however , @xmath56 is noncompact ( and its volume is infinite ) for two following reasons .",
    "approximately , an element of @xmath56 can be imagined as a nonlinear superposition of @xmath2 instantons of charge @xmath58",
    ". some of those may become point - like , i.e.  their curvature may concentrate in a @xmath59-function spike , while others may wander off to infinity .",
    "a partial compactification of @xmath56 , constructed by uhlenbeck , which replaces point - like instanton by just points of @xmath33 , takes care of the first problem but not the second .",
    "nekrasov s idea was to use _ equivariant integration _ to regularize the instanton contributions .",
    "the group @xmath60 acts on @xmath56 by rotations of @xmath61 and constant gauge transformation , respectively .",
    "our plan is to use this action for regularization",
    ". let s start with the following simplest example : suppose we want to regularize the volume of @xmath62 . a gentle way to do",
    "it is to introduce a gaussian well @xmath63 and thus an effective cut - off at the @xmath64 scale .",
    "note that the hamiltonian flow on @xmath62 generated by @xmath65 with respect to the standard symplectic form @xmath66 is rotation about the origin with angular velocity one .",
    "this makes a simplest instance of the atiyah - bott - duistermaat - heckman _ equivariant localization _ formula @xcite .",
    "we will use localization in the following complex form .",
    "let @xmath67 act on a complex manifold @xmath68 with isolated fixed points @xmath69 .",

    ". then @xmath73 where @xmath74 should be viewed as an element of @xmath75 , an so it acts in the complex tangent space @xmath76 to a fixed point @xmath77 .",
    "while is normally stated for compact manifolds",
    "@xmath68 , example shows that with care it can work for noncompact ones , too . scaling both @xmath72 and @xmath71 to zero ,",
    "we get from a formal expression @xmath78 which does not depends on the symplectic form and vanishes if @xmath68 is compact .",
    "a theorem of donaldson identifies instantons with _",
    "holomorphic bundles _ on @xmath79 and thus gives a complex description of @xmath56 .",
    "concretely , @xmath56 is the moduli space of rank @xmath80 holomorphic bundles @xmath81 with given 2nd chern class @xmath82 and a given trivialization along the line @xmath83 at infinity .",
    "note that existence of such trivialization implies that @xmath84 .",
    "a similar but larger moduli space @xmath85 of _ torsion - free sheaves _ , see e.g.  @xcite , is a smooth partial compactification of @xmath56 .",
    "the complexification of @xmath86 @xmath87 acts on @xmath85 by operating on @xmath88 and changing the trivialization at infinity .",
    "equivariant localization with respect to a general @xmath89 @xmath90 combines the two following effects .",
    "first , it introduces a spatial cut - off parameter @xmath91 as in .",
    "second , it introduces dependence on the instanton s behavior at infinity through the parameters @xmath92 . while the first factor in @xmath86 works to shepherd run - away instantons back to the origin , the second works to break the gauge invariance at infinity . in supersymmetric gauge theories ,",
    "the parameters @xmath92 correspond to the vacuum expectation of the higgs field and thus are responsible for masses of gauge bosons . in short ,",
    "they are live physical parameters .",
    "we are now ready to introduce our main object of study , the partition function of the pure ( @xmath0 supersymmetric ) @xmath22 gauge theory : @xmath93 where the integral is defined by applied to , @xmath94 and @xmath95 is a certain perturbative factor to be discussed below .",

    "indeed , poles of multiplicity @xmath100 may affect the free energy , but it is a question of competition with the other terms in @xmath96 , which the pole - free terms win if @xmath101 . as a result , either by passing to a subsequence of @xmath91 , or by restricting summation in @xmath96 to the relevant pole - free terms , we obtain a limit @xmath102 which is analytic and monotone far enough from the walls of the weyl chambers . recall that weyl chambers for @xmath103 are the @xmath104 cones obtained from @xmath105 by permuting the coordinates .",

    "the function @xmath253 will turn out to be nonnegative and supported on a union of @xmath80 intervals , which are precisely the _ bands _ of section [ ssw ] .",
    "the gaps will produce the facets in the limit shape .",
    "it is elementary to see that for a maximal curve the map @xmath254 where @xmath121 is the smaller root of , defines a conformal map of the upper half - plane to a slit half - strip @xmath255 as in figure [ confmap ] .",
    "the slits in @xmath256 go along @xmath257 and their lengths are , essentially , the critical values of the polynomial @xmath118 . the bands and gaps",
    "are preimages of the horizontal and vertical segments of @xmath258 , respectively .",
    "( 0,0)(27,14)(-3,0 ) ( 15,10)@xmath259 ( 28,12)@xmath256    we claim that @xmath260 where the polynomial @xmath118 is determined by the relation below .",
    "the equations are verified for as follows . since @xmath261 , @xmath262",
    ", we have the hilbert transform relation @xmath263 integrating it once and using to fix the integration constant , we get @xmath264 therefore , the function @xmath265 is constant on the bands and strictly increasing on the gaps , hence satisfies with @xmath266 integrating by parts and using definitions from section [ ssw ] gives @xmath267 thus every limit shape @xmath24 comes from a maximal curve .",
    "for example , the limit shape corresponding to the curve from figure [ ovals ] is plotted in figure [ limshape ] .",
    "note also that for @xmath268 , we have @xmath269 where @xmath270 is the intercept of the @xmath271th facet of the limit shape .",
    "in particular , @xmath272 .    for given @xmath273 , consider the distribution of the @xmath80-quotients @xmath274 of the partition @xmath5 , as defined in section [ szdu ] .",
    "for the shifts @xmath275 in we have using @xmath276 in probability .",
    "observe that @xmath277 ( \\psi_\\star)\\ ] ] since the other term , containing @xmath278 , vanishes by the definition of a maximum .",
    "definitions and integration by parts yield @xmath279 by , this means that the resulting sum over the @xmath80-quotients @xmath274 is the original partition function @xmath16 with parameters @xmath153 .",
    "this concludes the proof .",
    "an obvious @xmath28-dimensional generalization of a partition , also known as a plane partition can be seen on the right .",
    "more generally , we consider _ stepped surfaces _ , that is , continuous surfaces glued out of sides of a unit cube , spanning a given polygonal contour in @xmath280 , and projecting @xmath58-to-@xmath58 in the @xmath281 direction , see figure [ fcard ] .",
    "note that stepped surfaces minimize the surface area for given boundary conditions , hence can be viewed as zero temperature limit of the interface in the 3d ising model .",
    "the most natural measure on stepped surfaces is the uniform one with given boundary conditions , possibly conditioned on the volume enclosed .",
    "it induces plancherel - like measures on @xmath47-dimensional slices .",
    "stepped surfaces are in a natural bijection with fully packed dimers on the hexagonal lattice and kasteleyn theory of planar dimers @xcite forms the basis of most subsequent developments .",
    "the following law of large numbers for stepped surfaces was proven in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath282 be a sequence of boundary contours such that each @xmath282 can be spanned by at least one stepped surface .",
    "suppose that @xmath283 converge to a given curve @xmath284 .",
    "then , scaled by @xmath285 , uniform measures on stepped surfaces spanning @xmath282 converge to the @xmath59-measure on a single lipschitz surface spanning @xmath21  the limit shape .",
    "this limit shape formation is clearly visible in figure [ fcard ] .",
    "the limit shape is the unique minimizer of the following functional .",
    "let the surface be parameterized by @xmath286 , where @xmath287 is a lipschitz function with gradient in the triangle @xmath288 with vertices @xmath289 .",
    "let @xmath290 be the planar region enclosed by the projection of @xmath21 in the @xmath281 direction .",
    "we will use @xmath291 as coordinates on @xmath290 .",
    "the limit shape is the unique minimizer of @xmath292 where , in the language of @xcite , the surface tension @xmath293 is the legendre dual of the ronkin function of the straight line @xmath294 we recall that for a plane curve @xmath295 , its ronkin function @xcite is defined by @xmath296 the gradient @xmath297 always takes values in the newton polygon @xmath298 of the polynomial @xmath299 , so @xmath298 is naturally the domain of the legendre transform @xmath300 . for the straight line as above , the newton polygon is evidently the triangle @xmath288 .",
    "the surface tension @xmath293 is singular and not strictly convex at the boundary of @xmath288 , which leads to formation of _ facets _ and _ edges _ in the limit shape ( which can be clearly seen in figure [ fcard ] ) . this models facet formation in natural interfaces , e.g.  crystalline surfaces , and is the most interesting aspect of the model .",
    "note that facets are completely ordered ( or _ frozen _ ) .",
    "the boundary between the ordered and disordered ( or _ liquid _ ) regions is known as the _",
    "frozen boundary_.    the following transformation of the euler - lagrange equation for found in @xcite greatly facilitates the study of the facet formation .",
    "namely , in the liquid region we have @xmath301 where the functions @xmath302 and @xmath121 solve the differential equation @xmath303 and the algebraic equation . here",
    "@xmath304 is the lagrange multiplier for the volume constraint @xmath305 , the unconstrained case is @xmath306 . at the boundary of the liquid region , @xmath302 and @xmath121",
    "become real and the @xmath307 starts to point in one of the coordinate directions .",
    "the first - order quasilinear equation is , essentially , the complex burgers equation @xmath308 and , in particular , it can be solved by complex characteristics as follows .",
    "there exists an analytic function @xmath309 such that @xmath310 in other words , @xmath311 can be found by solving and . in spirit",
    ", this is very close to weierstra   parametrization of minimal surfaces in terms of analytic data .",
    "frozen boundary can only develop if @xmath312 is real , in which case the roots @xmath313 and @xmath314 of coincide at the frozen boundary . at a smooth point of the frozen boundary",
    ", the multiplicity of this root will be exactly two , hence @xmath307 has a square - root singularity there . as a result",
    ", the limit shape has an @xmath315 singularity at the generic point of the frozen boundary , thus recovering the well - known pokrovsky - talapov law @xcite in this situation . at special points of the frozen boundary , triple solutions of occur , leading to a cusp singularity .",
    "one such point can be seen in figure [ fcard ] .    remarkably , for a dense set of boundary condition the function @xmath312 is , in fact , a polynomial .",
    "consequently , the frozen boundary takes the form @xmath316 , where @xmath317 is the polynomial defining the planar dual of the curve @xmath318 .",
    "this allows to use powerful tools of algebraic geometry to study the singularities of the solutions , see @xcite .",
    "the precise result proven there is    suppose the boundary contour @xmath21 is a connected polygon with @xmath319 sides in coordinate directions ( cyclically repeated ) which can be spanned by a lipschitz function with gradient in @xmath288 .",
    "then @xmath318 is an algebraic curve of degree @xmath320 and genus zero .",
    "for example , for the boundary contour in figure [ fcard ] we have @xmath321 ( one of the boundary edges there has zero length ) and hence @xmath317 is the dual of a degree 3 genus 0 curve  a cardioid .",
    "the procedure of determining @xmath312 from the boundary conditions is effective and can be turned into a practical numeric homotopy procedure , see @xcite .",
    "higher genus frozen boundaries occur for multiply - connected domains , in fact , the genus of @xmath312 equals the genus of the liquid region .    of course , for a probabilist , the law of large numbers is only the beginning and the questions about clt corrections to the limit shape and local statistics of the surface in various regions of the limit shape follow immediately .",
    "conjecturally , the limit shape controls the answers to all these questions . for example",
    ", the function @xmath322 defines a _ complex structure _ on the liquid region and , conjecturally , the gaussian correction to the limit shape is given by the _ massless free field _ in the corresponding conformal structure . in the absence of frozen boundaries and without the volume constraint",
    ", this is proven in @xcite .",
    "see e.g.  @xcite for an introduction to the local statistics questions .",
    "having discussed periodically weighted plancherel measure and a @xmath28-dimensional analog of the plancherel measure , we now turn to periodically weighted stepped surfaces .",
    "this is very natural if stepped surfaces are interpreted as crystalline interfaces .",
    "periodic weights are introduced as follows : we weight each square by a periodic function of @xmath323 and @xmath324 ( with some integer period @xmath325 ) .",
    "the role previously played by the straight line is now played by a certain higher degree curve @xmath295 , the spectral curve of the corresponding periodic kasteleyn operator . in particular , the surface tension @xmath293 is now replaced by the legendre dual of the ronkin function of @xmath299 , see @xcite .",
    "we have @xmath326 and the coefficients of @xmath299 depend polynomially on the weights .    the main result of @xcite , known as _ maximality _ , says that for real and positive weights the curve @xmath299 is always a real algebraic curve of a very special kind , namely , a _ harnack curve _ , see @xcite .",
    "conversely , as shown in @xcite , all harnack curves arise in this way .",
    "harnack curves are , in some sense , the best possible real curves ; their many remarkable properties are discussed in @xcite .",
    "one of several equivalent definitions of a harnack curve is that the map @xmath327 from @xmath295 to @xmath62 is @xmath58-to-@xmath58 on the real locus of @xmath299 and @xmath47-to-@xmath58 over the rest .",
    "the image of @xmath328 under is known as the _ amoeba _ of @xmath299 .",
    "note from that the gradient @xmath297 of the ronkin function of @xmath299 is nonconstant precisely for @xmath329 in the amoeba of @xmath299 . in other words ,",
    "the ronkin function has a facet ( that is , a linear piece ) over every component of the amoeba complement .",
    "the @xmath47-to-@xmath58 property implies that the number of compact facets of ronkin function equals the ( geometric ) genus of the curve @xmath299 .",
    "each of these facets translates into the singularity of the surface tension and , hence , into facets with the same slope in limit shapes .    by wulff",
    "s theorem , the ronkin function itself is a minimizer , corresponding to its own ( `` crystal corner '' ) boundary conditions .",
    "an example of the ronkin function of a genus @xmath58 harnack curve can be seen in figure [ fronk ] .",
    "maximality implies _ persistence of facets _ , namely , for fixed period @xmath325 , there will be @xmath330 compact facets of the ronkin function and @xmath330 corresponding singularities of the surface tension , except on a codimension @xmath47 subvariety of the space of weights .",
    "it also implies e.g.  the following _ universality of height fluctuations _ in the liquid region @xmath331      from our experience with periodically weighted plancherel measure , it is natural to expect that , for some special boundary conditions , the partition function of periodically weighted stepped surfaces will encode valuable physical information .",
    "a natural choice of `` special boundary conditions '' are the those of a _ crystal corner _",
    ", when we require the surface to be asymptotic to given planes at infinity , as in figure [ fronk ] . for convergence of the partition function ,",
    "one introduces a fugacity factor @xmath332 , where the missing volume is measured with respect to the `` full corner '' .",
    "i hope that further study will reveal many special properties of such crystal corner partition functions .",
    "their extremely degenerate limits have been identified with all - genera , all - degree generating functions for donaldson - thomas invariants of toric calabi - yau threefolds .",
    "namely , as the periodic weights become extreme , all limit shapes , and the ronkin function in particular , degenerate to piecewise linear functions .",
    "this is known as the _ tropical limit_. the only remaining features of limit shapes are the edges and the triple points , where @xmath47 and @xmath28 facets meet , respectively . in this tropical limit ,",
    "the partition function becomes the partition function of ordinary , unweighted , 3d partitions located at triple points .",
    "these 3d partitions may have infinite legs along the edges , as in figure [ fedge ] and through these legs they interact with their neighbors .",
    "this description precisely matches the localization formula for donaldson - thomas invariants of the toric threefold whose toric polyhedron is given by the piecewise linear limit shape , see @xcite .",
    "donaldson - thomas theory of any @xmath28-fold has been conjectured to be equivalent , in a nontrivial way , to the gromov - witten theory of the same @xmath28-fold in @xcite . for the toric calabi - yau @xmath28-folds ,",
    "this specializes to the earlier _ topological vertex _ conjecture of @xcite .",
    "it is impossible to adequately review this subject here , see @xcite for an introduction .",
    "this is also related to the supersymmetric gauge theories considered in section [ sgau ] , or rather their 5-dimensional generalizations , via a procedure called _ geometric engineering _ of gauge theories .",
    "see for example @xcite and references therein .",
    "i find such close and unexpected interaction between rather basic statistical models and instantons in supersymmetric gauge and string theories very exciting and promising .",
