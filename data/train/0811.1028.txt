    "@xcite at this density , the size of the recording bit approaches a limit constrained by superparamagnetism .",
    "this issue is additionally complicated by the requirement that bits should maintain @xmath1 of their magnetization over a period of ten years to meet the industry standard .",

    "@xcite storage bits should consequently have the property of a single characteristic switching time , which ensures a predictable response as the read / write head of the device passes over the recording medium .",
    "along with meeting the numerous manufacturing challenges facing the implementation of these requirements , a comprehensive characterization of the magnetization switching of the constituent small , magnetic particles is needed .    in this paper , we study the switching statistics of models of elongated iron nanopillars , using several different resolutions of the computational lattice to model the same physical pillar . the high aspect ratio of these systems introduces a shape - induced anisotropy that assists in raising the coercivity of the particle and reducing unwanted thermally - activated switching during the long - term storage of the bit information . here",
    ", we are particularly interested in bimodal distributions of the switching time arising in various regimes of the applied field , which could potentially compromise the reliability of the switching process .",
    "a bimodal distribution was first witnessed in a highly resolved model of an iron nanopillar based on experimental work by von molnr and collaborators .",
    "@xcite preliminary results for this model indicated a bimodal distribution of switching times near the minimum switching field @xmath2 for an obliquely aligned applied field .",
    "@xcite however , as a consequence of the complexity of the numerical model , it has proved difficult to adequately describe the underlying mechanism responsible for the observed switching - time distribution . to obtain a more comprehensive understanding , in this paper",
    "we look for bimodal distributions of the switching time for lower - resolution models of the same system .",

    "the highest - resolution model for their experimental nanopillar has a lattice discretization on the order of the physical exchange length @xmath5 .",

    "for the high - resolution model , this is a result of the initial formation of endcaps , regions of large curl at the ends of the pillar that lower the free energy through pole avoidance .",
    "since end spins of the medium - resolution model have only one nearest neighbor , they can have larger changes in orientation for a given energy cost compared to the internally located spins .",
    "the center of the pillar between the two ends remains mostly uniform while in the metastable state for both of these models , except for small thermal fluctuations and propagating low - amplitude spin waves . eventually , the collective , random thermal fluctuations carry one or both ends out of the metastable free - energy well and allow magnetization switching to occur .",
    "the macrospin model , however , only has to exit from a simple two - dimensional metastable free - energy well and switches via a precession that dissipates energy through the damping term in the llg equation .",
    "first , we describe results for this nanopillar system with a three - dimensional , high - resolution , @xmath44 cells computational model that possesses a lattice discretization , @xmath49 , which is smaller than the exchange length of @xmath50  nm for the real system .",

    "a further decrease of @xmath49 should not provide significantly increased accuracy .",
    "when this model is subjected to a near - coercive applied field , @xmath52  oe at @xmath53 with respect to the long axis of the pillar , a bimodal distribution of fpts is obtained .",

    "]    we found that the bimodal switching - time distribution is the result of multiple switching paths through a high - dimensional free - energy landscape , each path with a single characteristic switching time that the system chooses with almost equal probability for the applied field used in this study .",
    "measurements of the total energy @xmath62 during the simulations were nearly constant during the switching process , indicating that changes in the free energy @xmath63 mostly come from changes in the entropy @xmath64 .",
    "fluctuations of the coarse - grained spins allow trajectories to enter a region of the free - energy space influenced by a local minimum that requires a large decrease in @xmath64 to exit , resulting in the slow mode .",
    "if the fluctuations do not cause the pillar to fall into this metastable free - energy well , a fast mode is observed for which the trajectories follow a free - energy path with almost constant @xmath65 , corresponding to an entropy change that is relatively small .",
    "the difference in the magnetization configurations of the endcaps between the two modes is subtle , however , and it has proved difficult to identify the mode solely by analyzing the endcaps .",
    "for example , the volumes of the endcaps are nearly the same for both the fast and slow modes and agree with the experimental fit of the activation volume yielding @xmath66  nm@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite further characterization of the endcap configuration did not reveal differences that would indicate if switching occurred via a fast or a slow mode .    since switching is equally likely to initiate at either endcap",
    ", fast modes occur if either one or both endcaps do not pass through the long - lived configuration .",
    "however , it is necessary for both endcaps to explore the longer - lived metastable configuration in order to qualify as a slow mode . for the high - resolution pillar",
    ", we also find that the fast - mode statistics are not dependent on the number of endcaps that switch ( one vs two ) .",

    "finally , for the lowest - resolution representation of the physical nanopillar as a single effective spin , a bimodal distribution is seen as a ridge that stretches across the interior of the applied - field space , away from the coercive edge .",
    "the bimodal distribution in this model is a result of a precession that can pass through the magnetization value defining a switching event earlier or later , depending on the small thermal fluctuations .",
    "trials that do not pass this magnetization value early will consequently cross it during the next precession , resulting in the observed bimodal distribution .",
    "for the three models studied in this paper , only the highest - resolution model adequately captures fluctuations that result in multiple switching paths in the free energy that may occur in real pillars of width larger than the exchange length .",
    "consequently , our results show that conclusions about physical processes in simulated systems must take into account the degree to which the model resolution can reflect the length scales of the physically relevant fluctuations .",

    "we can approximate the shape - induced anisotropy for the macrospin model by evaluating the magnetostatic self - energy of a pillar with the same dimensions as the full model ( @xmath45 ) . to simplify the calculation ,",
    "the magnetization of the pillar is assumed to be uniform and parallel with the longest axis .",
    "the general expression of the magnetic scalar potential ,  @xcite @xmath132 will consequently drop the first integral on the right - hand side since @xmath133 .",
    "the remaining surface integral , involving the effective surface charges @xmath134 at the ends of the pillar , is used to calculate the mutual self - energy of the two end faces with dimensions @xmath135 , separated by a distance @xmath136 , and the self - energy of each individual face by letting @xmath137 .",
    "together , these three terms are all that is needed to approximate the self - energy of our model .    for the mutual energy @xmath138 of the two faces at the ends of the pillar ,",
    "the magnetic scalar potential should be integrated across both surfaces such that @xmath139 solution of this integral is straightforward , although tedious , and can be expressed as a single function ,  @xcite @xmath140 where @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 .",
    "the mutual energy of the two end faces of the pillar is then given by @xmath144 while the self - energy @xmath145 of each face is @xmath146 hence , the total demagnetizing energy @xmath147 of the cuboid is @xmath148.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the final step to this approximation involves the definition of the magnetometric demagnetizing factor in the @xmath33-direction @xmath119 , which in our case has the definition  @xcite @xmath149 the remaining factors in the @xmath150 and @xmath151-direction , @xmath123 and @xmath124 are evaluated by noting that @xmath152 and @xmath153 ."
