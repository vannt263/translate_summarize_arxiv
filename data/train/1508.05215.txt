    "a key aspect in microfluidics is to understand the theoretical fundamentals of flow at low - reynolds numbers and to exploit them directly in applications and devices . as the miniaturisation is an ongoing trend , especially lab - on - a - chip ( loc ) or micro total analysis systems ( tas )",

    "therefore , the analysis and diagnostics of reagents within microfluidic channels require switching , driving and mixing of the liquid fluids @xcite . optical forces , for instance , provide a non - contact trapping and manipulation of microobjects or biological cells and are sufficient for usage in different microfluidic applications .",

    "furthermore , the need of measuring systems within microfluidic channels with high precision arises .",
    "besides actuation , systems based on optical forces can be used for sensing and characterizing of fluid properties .",
    "for example , di leonardo _ et al .",
    "_ and knner _",
    "et al . _ have measured the flow field in a microfluidic device with ot s @xcite . in both studies",
    "a spherical microrotor has been activated by interaction of polarized laser light with a birefringent vaterite crystal .",
    "the rotation has led to a fluid flow and a displacement of an inserted probe particle .",
    "the azimuthal flow field around the microsphere has been determined by measuring the shift of the probe particle .",
    "however , no radial component has been detected in these studies .",
    "objects in microfluidic systems rotating about their center in axisymmetric manner can easily produce azimuthal flow , which is also supported by theory @xcite . whether a rotating microstructure can induce a radial flow component at low - reynolds numbers",
    ", however , seems to be far less understood .",
    "moreover , for axisymmetric rotations , simple symmetry arguments suggest that such a radial flow can not occur .",
    "in addition , theoretical works @xcite on non - axisymmmetric rotations appear to be restricted to ellipsoidal bodies and prove to be quite challenging from a mathematical point of view . the work of camassa _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , for instance , treats the problem of an ellipsoid sweeping out a double cone in stokes flow . here",
    ", a rather complex spatio - temporal velocity field is obtained and explicitly analyzed for certain limit cases ( small cone angles , far - field behavior etc . ) .",
    "although a radial flow component is predicted , the main focus of this works lies on the advection of tracers and the establishment of certain invariants for the above mentioned limit cases .",
    "consequently , the main purpose of this paper is to gain some insight on the persistence of such radial flow for the case of non - axisymmetric rotations at low - reynolds numbers .",
    "moreover , the azimuthal velocity field component is investigated and compared to the case of a purely axisymmetric rotation . to this end , a comparatively simple model that is based on the superposition of two rotlets @xcite is used in order to approximate the rod - shaped rotor geometry and to make statements about the induced velocity fields .    the mere fact that the rotlet solution as a fundamental solution to the stokes equation for low - reynolds number flows basically shares the same velocity profile as the point - vortex solution of the two - dimensional euler equation @xcite allows to draw an interesting analogy to a recently proposed generalized vortex model @xcite . here , the model consists of pairs of like - signed point - vortices and it has been shown that the straining of these small - scale vortical structures leads to non - vanishing radial velocity components that prove to be of great importance for the energy transport in such a two - dimensional flow .",
    "although the rotlet and the point - vortex solution apply to two very different reynolds number regimes , this striking analogy allows to predict a possible radial flow also for the stokes equation .    in this paper , the predictions of this rotlet model",
    "are compared to experimental results that allow the detection of azimuthal and radial flow components influenced by microrotors .",
    "the experiments were performed using a combination of optical and magnetic forces , which enables the manufacture of rod - shaped microrotors and the investigation of the flow fields .",
    "recently this method has been successfully applied for constructing a micro- + pump for microfluidic channels @xcite .",
    "the proposed model captures the main effects of the rotors investigated in the experiment . here , we mainly follow the procedure described by chwang and wu who approximated the velocity field of a rotating dumbbell - shaped body via a superposition of two rotlets spinning about the main axis of symmetry @xcite ; hence , the resulting velocity field only possessed an azimuthal component .",
    "the main difference in our approach is that we consider non - axisymmetric rotations , which turn out to induce an additional radial flow component . to this end",
    ", we initially work in a frame of reference where the rotor is at rest and assume that the entire fluid is undergoing a rotation about the @xmath0 axis with the angular velocity @xmath1 .",

    "we obtain @xmath33 for the radial velocity component and @xmath34 for the azimuthal velocity component .",
    "it can be seen that the radial component oscillates with twice the rotor frequency , whereas the azimuthal component is a superposition of a time - independent part and a time - dependent part that does not vanish in average , since @xmath35 is a constant .",
    "thereby the time - dependence of the velocity field not inherently contained in the stokes equation is due to the inclusion of time - dependent boundary conditions similarly to the case of taylor s swimming sheet @xcite .",
