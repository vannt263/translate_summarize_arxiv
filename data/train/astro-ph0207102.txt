    "the x - ray transient sax j1808.43658 was discovered in september 1996 when it exhibited a weak outburst lasting only a few weeks @xcite . in april 1998",
    "the source was found to be in outburst again @xcite and it was discovered that the source exhibits coherent millisecond x - ray oscillations with a frequency of approximately 401 hz @xcite . in early 2000 , the source exhibited a third outburst during which it showed erratic luminosity behavior with luminosity swings of three orders of magnitude within a few days @xcite .",
    "this erratic behavior lasted for several months before the source returned to quiescence . very recently , in october 2002 , a fourth outburst of the source was detected @xcite during which its peak luminosity was very similar to that observed during the 1996 and 1998 outbursts .    in quiescence ,",
    "sax j1808.43658 has been observed on several occasions with the _ bepposax _ and _ asca _ satellites @xcite .",
    "the source was very dim in quiescence , with a luminosity close to or lower than @xmath3 erg s@xmath1 . due to the limited angular resolution of _ bepposax",
    "_ , doubts were raised as to whether the source detected by this satellite was truly sax j1808.43658 or an unrelated field source @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported on a quiescent observation of the source performed with _",
    "xmm - newton _ which resolved this issue .",
    "they detected the source at a luminosity of @xmath4 erg s@xmath1  and found that the field around sax j1808.43658 is rather crowded with weak sources .",
    "two such sources are relatively close to sax j1808.43658 and might have conceivably caused a systematic positional offset during the _ bepposax _ observations of sax j1808.43658 .",
    "after it was found that the source had become active again in january 2000 @xcite , a director s discretionary time ( ddt ) observation request was submitted to the director of _ xmm - newton _ to study the outburst x - ray spectrum of sax j1808.43658 .",
    "this request was granted and on march 6 , 2000 , _ xmm - newton _ observed the source . due to the extreme variability of the source during its 2000 outburst @xcite , the _ xmm - newton _ observation was performed during times when the source had very low luminosities ( see   [ section : observation ] ) . because of this the ddt observation was considered to be in conflict with an approved cycle 1 observation on this source with the purpose of studying the quiescent x - ray properties of sax j1808.43658 ( see * ? ? ? * for the results of that observation ) .",
    "consequently , the ddt observation was not made public until recently . in this paper",
    "i discuss this ddt observation during which the source was conclusively detected at a luminosity of @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "c    because a bright x - ray source was expected during the 2000 outburst , the _ xmm - newton_/epic - pn camera was used in the timing mode to eliminate pile - up problems and to study the pulsations . however , due to the faintness of the source and the high background when using this mode , the resulting data are not optimal for studying the source spectrum at the observed low luminosities .",
    "therefore , only the data obtained with the two metal oxide semiconductor ( mos ) cameras will be discussed .",
    "the mos1 camera was used in the full frame mode , but the mos2 was in the small window mode ( again to limit the anticipated pile - up ) . for both cameras",
    "the medium filter was used .",
    "the source was not detected in the rgs instruments so that data will not be discussed further .",
    "the log of the observation and the data used in this paper are listed in table  [ tab : log ] .",
    "the data were analysed using the standard analysis system ( sas ) , version 5.3 .",
    "the observation was split into two observation identifiers ( ids ; see tab .",
    "[ tab : log ] ) and it was found that the mos1 science data were all present in the first i d ( 0119940201 ) , but that the housekeeping data were split over the two ids ( the mos2 science data _ and _ housekeeping data were both split , in a consistent manner , over the two ids ) .",
    "this discrepancy caused the standard processing of the data to create only about half the available mos1 science data . to obtain the full amount of mos1 science data , the sas task _ emchain _",
    "was executed but after the housekeeping files for the mos1 were merged and using the latest calibration files .",
    "those newly created event list files ( also for the mos2 ) were used in the subsequent analysis . at the end of the observation , a strong background flare occurred .",
    "the data in which the total count rate ( all ccds and no extra filtering ) exceeded 5 and 4 counts per second ( using 100 second bins ) for the mos1 and mos2 data , respectively , were excluded from the analysis .",
    "the resulting total live time of the central ccd ( the ccd on which sax j1808.43658 is located ) is listed in table  [ tab : log ] .",
    "the mos1 image in the 0.510 kev energy band is shown in figure  [ fig : image ] ( top ) where we clearly see that sax j1808.43658 was detected .",
    "this source is the brightest source on the central ccd , strongly indicating that during the _ bepposax _ 2000 outburst observations most of the detected flux originated from sax j1808.4365 and not from an unrelated field source as was suggested by the _",
    "data @xcite . @xcite reached similar conclusions using a quiescent observation of the source and they suggested that the systematic offset of the _ bepposax _ position with regards to that of sax j1808.43658 might have been caused by the presence of two faint sources close to sax j1808.43658 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] , top panel ; see also fig .  1 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "moreover , due to the source faintness during the _ bepposax _ observations , only the medium energy concentrator spectrometer produced useful data @xcite and this instrument was only sensitive in the energy range 1.310 kev",
    ". therefore , images of the data in the 0.51.3 kev and the 1.310 kev energy bands were made ( figs .",
    "[ fig : image ] , middle and bottom panel ) and sax j1808.43658 is detected in both energy ranges .",
    "in contrast , the two extra sources are only detected in the 1.310 kev band , demonstrating that the fractional flux contribution of the two other sources to the combined flux increases with photon energy .",
    "these differences in source spectra add further evidence to the suggestion that those two extra sources might have caused the systematic offset in the _ bepposax _ observations .",
    "it should be noted that the _ bepposax _ fluxes quoted by @xcite and @xcite for sax j1808.43658 are likely close to its true flux .",
    "a small contamination of the fluxes by the two close - by sources is likely , but those sources are considerably less luminous than sax j1808.43658 and therefore the contamination should be small .",
    "c    the x - ray source spectra were extracted using a circle with a radius of 20@xmath5 on the position of sax j1808.43658 .",
    "for the mos1 camera , the background spectrum was extracted using a circle with a radius of 200@xmath5 on the same position , but excluding the detected point sources in this region .",
    "because of the use of the small window mode , only a limited field could be use to extract the background spectrum for the mos2 camera ( i.e. , an annulus was used on the source position with an inner radius of 30@xmath5 and an outer radius of 50@xmath5 ) .",
    "the rmf and arf files were created with the sas tools _ rmfgen _ and _ arfgen_. the spectra obtained were then grouped using the ftool _ grppha _ into bins with a minimum of 20 counts per bin to validate the use of the @xmath6 statistics .",
    "the mos1 and mos2 spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] and were fitted ( using xspec version 11.1.0 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) simultaneously using the same model ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : spectrum ] for the fit parameters ) . the column density @xmath7   was allowed to float and the value obtained was always consistent with the value ( @xmath8 @xmath9 ) inferred from the @xmath10 measured by @xcite ( and using the relation between @xmath7  and @xmath10 from * ? ? ?",
    "the spectrum could be fitted with a power - law model with index of 2.2@xmath110.3 and a 0.510 kev luminosity of @xmath12 erg s@xmath1   ( assuming a distance of 2.5 kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "a black body model could not fit the data accurately ( @xmath6/degrees of freedom = 88.7/25 ) . a neutron star atmosphere model ( that of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could fit the data but with a relatively high temperature @xmath13 of @xmath20.2 kev ( for an observer at infinity ) and a neutron star radius of 4.5@xmath110.1 km ( as measured on the surface and using a neutron star mass of 1.4 m@xmath14 ) .",
    "the x - ray spectra of other quiescent neutron star transients can sometimes be described by a two component model ( a soft thermal component below 1 kev and a power - law - like component above a few kev ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but with the soft component dominating the spectrum ( although the power - law component can occasionally contribute nearly half the 0.510 kev flux of the source ) .",
    "although not required by the data , the spectra were also fitted using such a two component model , with either a black body or an atmosphere model for the soft component . with these models ,",
    "the spectra could be accurately fitted ( see tab .  [ tab : spectrum ] ) , although the atmosphere plus power law combination was very unstable and the errors on the parameters are therefore relatively large .",
    "the temperatures obtained for the soft component were similar to those obtained for other quiescent neutron star transients .",
    "the flux contribution of the soft component to the 0.510 kev flux was only @xmath225% of the total flux in contrast to the other systems in which the soft component dominates .",
    "this paper discusses the _ xmm - newton _ observation of the accretion - driven millisecond x - ray pulsar sax j1808.43658 performed during its 2000 outburst .",
    "similar to the _ bepposax _ observations performed around the same time ( one of those observations was on the same day as the _ xmm - newton _",
    "one ) , the _ xmm - newton _ observation revealed only a weak x - ray source with a 0.510 kev luminosity of @xmath0 erg s@xmath1  at the position of sax j1808.43658 . despite its weakness ,",
    "the source was the brightest one on the central ccd proving that the _ bepposax _ source detected by @xcite and @xcite is indeed sax j1808.43658 and not an unrelated field source .",
    "the systematic off - set between the measured and the true position of sax j1808.43658 in those _ bepposax _ observations can likely be explained by two nearby field sources .",
    "these sources might have also contaminated the flux assigned to sax j1808.43658 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite reported on a quiescent observation of sax j1808.43658 performed with _ xmm - newton _ about a year after the end of the 2000 outburst ( the spectral fit parameters reported by @xcite are also listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : spectrum ] for comparison ) .",
    "they found that the source had a luminosity of only @xmath15 erg s@xmath1 , about a factor of 4 lower than what was measured during the 2000 outburst observation .",
    "this demonstrates that at very low luminosities , sax j1808.43658 can exhibit variability and indicates that the source probably displays variability in its quiescent state",
    ". however , caution is advised because the 2000 outburst observation was performed when the source exhibited violent behavior @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is still possible that in `` true '' quiescence the source will be observed consistently at the low level reported by @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of sax j1808.43658 during the 2000 outburst appears softer than its quiescent spectrum : when the spectrum is fitted with a power - law model , the photon index is 2.2@xmath110.3 during the 2000 outburst vs. 1.5@xmath16 in quiescence .",
    "the fact that the 2000 outburst spectrum can be accurately fit with a neutron star atmosphere model or with a combination of a thermal plus power - law component ( in contrast with the quiescent spectrum ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , also suggests a difference in the source spectra between the two epochs .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the two - component model , the photon index during the 2000 outburst observation is very similar to that measured during the quiescent observation , suggesting that the shape of the power - law component might not have changed considerably between the different epochs ( although the flux of this component was still a factor of @xmath23 higher during the 2000 outburst than in quiescence ) . due to the limited statistics of the data , the exact degree of spectral variability",
    "can not be determined nor can the exact cause of these possible variations be established .    during the 2000 outburst , the source fluctuated in luminosity by over 3 orders of magnitude on timescales of days @xcite . however , the _ bepposax _ observations reported by @xcite provided only rough estimates of the flux of sax j1808.43658 between 2000 march 5 and 8 . with the _ xmm - newton _ detection of the source on 2000 march 6",
    ", we now have a clearer picture of how dim the source could become during certain phases of its 2000 outburst .",
    "as stated by @xcite , the large luminosity variations observed during the 2000 outburst are difficult to understand as due to similarly dramatic variations in the mass accretion rate .",
    "it is more likely that only modest variations in the accretion rate can trigger transitions between two significantly different luminosity states .",
    "for example , centrifugal inhibition of accretion by the neutron star s magnetic field is expected below a certain critical accretion rate ( the propeller regime ; * ? ? ? * ) and small but erratic variations in the accretion rate around this critical rate could in principle give rise to the enormous luminosity swings observed during the 2000 outburst .",
    "when the source is in this propeller regime , accretion is inhibited , but it is evident from the large brightness fluctuations during the 2000 outburst , that a considerable amount of matter was still available in the accretion disk . according to @xcite , a pure propeller contribution is ruled out in quiescence since this mechanism is expected to stop operating at luminosities below @xmath17 erg s@xmath1  because the source should turn on then as a radio pulsar . @xcite and @xcite suggested that a possible explanation for the quiescent flux is the emission from the shock front between the relativistic wind of the radio pulsar and the matter out - flowing from the companion star .",
    "therefore , the flux during the 2000 outburst observation could be higher than that observed in quiescence because of the large amount of matter still present close to the neutron star .",
    "@xcite suggested an alternative explanation for the quiescent emission of sax j1808.43658 in which this emission is produced by direct dipole radiation from the radio pulsar .",
    "the quiescent x - ray luminosity and spectral shape of sax j1808.43658 are indeed consistent with those observed from several field millisecond radio pulsars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) , but @xcite found that the millisecond pulsars in the globular cluster 47 tuc have a predominantly soft spectral shape suggestive of a thermal origin in contrast to what is observed for sax j1808.43658 .",
    "conclusive proof for an active radio pulsar in sax j1808.43658 would come from the detection of radio pulsations during quiescence , although such a detection might be inhibited by the ambient matter still present in the system ( see also the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite noted that the quiescent properties of sax j1808.43658 are remarkably different from those observed for other quiescent neutron star systems : ( a ) its 0.510 kev luminosity is the lowest observed so far for any neutron star system , and ( b ) its spectrum is dominated by a power - law component instead of a thermal component .",
    "the quiescent emission of neutron star x - ray transients is most often explained by thermal emission from the neutron star surface releasing the heat deposited in the crust and core of the neutron star during outburst ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in this model",
    ", the exact luminosities of the systems should depend on their time - averaged accretion rates @xcite .",
    "due to the low peak luminosity of sax j1808.43658 , @xcite predicted that this source should be rather faint in quiescence . at first sight",
    "the low detected quiescent luminosity is consistent with this prediction , but no strong evidence could be found for a thermal component in the quiescent spectrum obtained .",
    "this indicates that the thermal luminosity of this source is very low , implying a rapidly cooling neutron star which would require enhanced core cooling processes to explain @xcite .",
    "the combination of the low time - averaged accretion rate and the possibility of rapid core cooling might also be able to explain why the quiescent spectra of sax j1808.43658 is dominated by the power - law component .",
    "if in the ordinary quiescent systems the thermal component were to drop to low luminosity levels similar to those of sax j1808.43658 , then their quiescent spectra would be dominated by the power - law component ( assuming that this component remains unchanged ) , just like in sax j1808.43658 .",
    "however , it remains to be determined if the power - law components in the different types of systems are due to the same mechanism , or if the quiescent spectrum of sax j1808.43658 is due to some other process , likely related to the different configuration and/or magnetic field strength of the neutron star in sax j1808.43658 . to get more insight into the nature of the unique quiescent properties of sax j1808.43658",
    ", more neutron star transients must be detected in quiescence .",
    "particularly interesting systems are the two other , very recently discovered , accretion driven millisecond x - ray pulsars xte j1751305 @xcite and xte j0929314 @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to compare their quiescent properties with those of sax j1808.43658 and correlate possible similarities and/or differences in quiescence with the outburst properties of those sources .",
