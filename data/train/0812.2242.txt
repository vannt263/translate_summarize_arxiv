    "<S> the _ locker puzzle _ is a game played by multiple players against a referee . </S>",
    "<S> it has been previously shown that the best strategy that exists can not succeed with probability greater than  , no matter how many players are involved . </S>",
    "<S> our contribution is to show that quantum players can do much better  they can succeed with . by making the rules of the game significantly stricter , </S>",

    "<S> specifically , we show that in the case of the _ locker puzzle _ , quantum players succeed with probability  1 while the known optimal classical success probability is bounded above by . in order to amplify this separation , we prove that a significantly stricter version of the locker puzzle has vanishing classical success probability , while still admitting a perfect quantum strategy . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the empty locker and the coloured slips versions of the locker puzzle , and the possibility of a cheating referee .    </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : locker puzzle ]    the _ _ locker puzzle _ _ is a cooperative game between a team of @xmath0 players numbered @xmath1 and a referee . in the initial phase of the game , the referee chooses a random permutation @xmath2 of @xmath3 , and for each player @xmath4 she places number @xmath4 in locker @xmath5 . in the following phase , each player </S>",
    "<S> is individually admitted into the locker room . </S>",
    "<S> once in the room , each player is allowed to open @xmath6 lockers , one at a time , and look at their contents ( for simplicity , we ll take @xmath0 to be even ) . </S>",
    "<S> after the player leaves the room , all lockers are closed . </S>",
    "<S> the players are initially allowed to discuss strategy , but once the game starts , they are separated and can not communicate . </S>",
    "<S> an individual player  @xmath4 _ wins _ if he opens a locker containing number  @xmath4 , while the team of @xmath0 players _ wins _ if all individual players  win .    </S>",
    "<S> we would like to know what is the best strategy for the team of @xmath0 players . </S>",
    "<S> a nave approach is for each player to independently choose @xmath6 lockers to open . </S>",
    "<S> each players wins independently with probability @xmath7 , hence the team wins with probability @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , it is known that the players can do much , much better ! </S>",
    "<S> we will review in section  [ section : optimal - classical - locker ] an optimum strategy by which , for any  @xmath0 , the players can win with probability at least  @xmath9 .    </S>",
    "<S> the locker puzzle was originally considered by peter bro miltersen , and was first published in  @xcite ; a journal version appears in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> sven skylum is credited for the pointer - following strategy that we will give in the next section . </S>",
    "<S> a proof of optimality for this strategy is given by eugene curtin and max warshauer  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our presentation of the classical puzzle and its solution follows along the lines of their article . </S>",
    "<S> many variations have been proposed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we will consider the variations of _ empty lockers _ in section  [ section : empty - lockers ] , _ coloured slips _ in section  [ section : coloured - slips ] ( to be accurate , the locker and the coloured slips puzzles are variants of the empty locker puzzle ) , and a _ cheating referee _ in section  [ sec : cheating ] .    </S>",
    "<S> [ section : optimal - classical - locker ]    we saw that a nave solution allows the players to win with an exponentially small probability . </S>",
    "<S> how can we devise a strategy that does better ? the reader avid to search for a solution on his or her own is encouraged to do so now .    </S>",
    "<S> the key is to find a solution where the individual success probabilities are not independent . </S>",
    "<S> consider the following strategy : when first entering the locker room , player  @xmath4 opens locker number  @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> a number is revealed ; this is used to indicate which locker to open next ( i.e.  if number  @xmath10 is revealed , the next locker opened is locker  @xmath10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> each player executes this pointer - following strategy until @xmath6 lockers are opened .    to analyze the success probability , note that the team will win provided that the _ permutation _ that corresponds to the placement of numbers in lockers by the referee does not contain a cycle of length longer than @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of such a long cycle occurring is : @xmath11    it can be shown that as @xmath12 , @xmath13 and that the sum increases with  @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> hence the probability that the team wins is decreasing to @xmath14 .    using a reduction to another game </S>",
    "<S> , this strategy can be shown to be optimal  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : quantum solution ]    we now present our first contribution : a quantum solution to the locker puzzle , which performs better than the classical solution .    as before the referee chooses a random permutation @xmath2 and she places numbers in the lockers according to this permutation . in the quantum solution , we allow the players to open locker doors in _ superposition _ , each player working with his own quantum register . </S>",
    "<S> this is analogous to the quantum query model . for the quantum case </S>",
    "<S> , we need to modify the goal of the game which , for player  @xmath4 , becomes to _ correctly guess _ the locker containing number  @xmath4 after @xmath6 queries , and _ not _ to open locker containing number  @xmath4 , because this would be too easy to do in superposition ! we show that quantum players can always win at the locker game . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , our results are stronger : we give a stricter version of the locker puzzle for which the optimal classical solution succeeds with vanishing probability , while a quantum strategy always succeeds !    [ imp ]    </S>",
    "<S> the main idea is to apply grover s quantum search algorithm to the locker puzzle . for player  @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the action of opening a locker as a query to the oracle which when input locker number  @xmath15 , @xmath16 , outputs the following : @xmath17 note that this oracle is weaker than the oracle in the original puzzle which would output @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss this further in section [ subsection : optimality ] and in the conclusion .    </S>",
    "<S> grover s search algorithm @xcite was thoroughly analyzed in @xcite , where it was shown that in a black - box search scenario where it is known that a single solution exists , @xmath19 queries yield a failure probability no greater than  @xmath20 , where  @xmath0 is the number of elements in the search space ( here ,  @xmath0 is assumed to be large ) . </S>",
    "<S> this was further improved in  @xcite , where is was shown that the same amount of queries is sufficient to find a solution with _ </S>",
    "<S> certainty_.    </S>",
    "<S> applying this directly to the quantum players of the locker puzzle yields the following :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> [ step : groverquery]each player performs @xmath19 queries ( this is less than the @xmath21 queries in the classical solution ) . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   each player wins independently with certainty , implying that the team wins with certainty .    </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : reducing - number - queries ]    we ve seen that quantum players of the locker game can succeed with probability  1 . </S>",
    "<S> our solution only requires @xmath19 oracle queries per player . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we now consider the asymptotically stricter version of the locker puzzle , where players are allowed to open at most @xmath22 lockers . </S>",
    "<S> the next theorem state that the success probability for classical players goes quickly to  0 .    </S>",
    "<S> [ thm : classic ] in the locker puzzle with @xmath22 queries , classical players win with probability at most  @xmath23 .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> we upper bound the success probability of the first @xmath25 players , when each player is allowed to open @xmath26 lockers . since @xmath27 , </S>",
    "<S> this upper bounds the success probability of all @xmath0 players .    </S>",
    "<S> consider a new game where the first player opens exactly  @xmath26 lockers and publicly reveals all of their contents . if the first player s number is not revealed the players lose and the game is over . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise the @xmath26 revealed players have successfully located their lockers . </S>",
    "<S> these @xmath26 lockers and players are now removed from the game . </S>",
    "<S> the first player has success probability at most  @xmath28 .    in successive rounds , </S>",
    "<S> a player is chosen from amongst those not yet removed from the game . </S>",
    "<S> he continues in the same way by choosing @xmath26 of the remaining lockers and revealing their contents . </S>",
    "<S> if he finds his label , again @xmath26 lockers and players are removed from the game . </S>",
    "<S> the game stops whenever a chosen player does not find his label . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise it continues for @xmath26 rounds and terminates with a win for the players .    </S>",
    "<S> the success probability of the new game is at most @xmath29 the original game with no revealing of numbers can not do better .    [ </S>",
    "<S> subsection : optimality ]    in the quantum query model with oracle ( [ eq : oracle ] ) the total number of queries required to obtain a success probability of one for the players is in @xmath30 .    </S>",
    "<S> first consider a variation of the quantum game where the players act sequentially in the order @xmath31 and are allowed to announce their results to the other players . </S>",
    "<S> the number of queries performed by player 1 must be in @xmath32 or he will not succeed with probability one . </S>",
    "<S> this follows from the analysis of grover s algorithm , see @xcite .    the only information given by the oracle @xmath33 is the location of the locker containing label @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> suppose player 2 is allowed to receive this information and remove that locker from consideration . </S>",
    "<S> the permutation @xmath2 induces a random permutation on the remaining @xmath35 lockers . </S>",
    "<S> player 2 s success probability is then one only if his number of queries is in @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> continuing , the @xmath4-th player must ask a number of queries in @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the total number of queries is therefore in  @xmath30 .    in the modified game we share all information available to all players that have not already played . </S>",
    "<S> so this shows a lower bound of the same order for the original version of the quantum game where no information is shared .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now compare the strength of oracle ( [ eq : oracle ] ) with the stronger oracle where @xmath38 . in the classical setup </S>",
    "<S> , the weaker oracle ( [ eq : oracle ] ) merely tells a given player whether or not his label is in a requested locker . </S>",
    "<S> there are an even number @xmath0 of lockers and he can ask @xmath39 queries . again </S>",
    "<S> we consider a sequential version of the game as described above , where each player reveals his results . </S>",
    "<S> if he succeeds , he reveals the locker with his number and that locker is removed . for the other lockers he queried </S>",
    "<S> , the only information he has is that they did not contain his label . </S>",
    "<S> therefore after his locker is removed , the other players have no further information . </S>",
    "<S> the success probability of this variation of the locker game is : @xmath40 where we have used stirling s formula twice . </S>",
    "<S> this is exponentially small and provides an upper bound on the success probability of the classical locker game with the weak oracle ( [ eq : oracle ] ) . by comparison , as we saw in section [ section : optimal - classical - locker ] the players can win with constant probability using the stronger oracle . </S>",
    "<S> an open question is whether the quantum algorithm can be improved by using this stronger oracle .    </S>",
    "<S> the original motivation for the locker puzzle came from the study of time - space tradeoffs for the substring search problem in the context of _ bit probe complexity _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . there , a version with both _ </S>",
    "<S> empty lockers _ and _ coloured slips _ was presented . </S>",
    "<S> we now examine these two variations separately and consider the quantum case .    </S>",
    "<S> [ section : empty - lockers ]    suppose there are a total of @xmath41 lockers . </S>",
    "<S> the referee selects an unordered subset @xmath2 of @xmath42 with cardinality @xmath0 and she puts label @xmath4 into locker @xmath43 for @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining @xmath45 lockers are empty . </S>",
    "<S> assume @xmath46 is even , and we allow the players to open up to @xmath47 lockers . </S>",
    "<S> an optimum winning strategy for this more general situation is unknown : the pointer algorithm fails if an empty locker is opened . </S>",
    "<S> even for the case @xmath48 , where half of the lockers are empty , it is still unknown if there is a classical strategy with success probability bounded away from zero @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the quantum strategy given in section  [ sec : quantum solution ] still succeeds with probability one with a number of queries in  @xmath49 per player , for a total of @xmath50 queries . </S>",
    "<S> it suffices to modify the oracle ( [ eq : oracle ] ) so that @xmath15 runs over the range @xmath51 , and query it @xmath52 times . </S>",
    "<S> if it turns out that for these same parameters , the classical success probability vanishes , then the power of the quantum world would be once more confirmed , as in section  [ sec : reducing - number - queries ] . and section  [ subsection : optimality ] .    </S>",
    "<S> [ section : coloured - slips ]    consider the empty lockers game with @xmath41 lockers , again with @xmath0 players and @xmath0 slips of paper , each labelled @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> this time the referee colours each slip either red or blue as she chooses , and places them in a randomly selected subset of @xmath0 lockers . as before , </S>",
    "<S> each player  @xmath4 may open @xmath47 lockers using any adaptive strategy , and based on this , must make a guess about the colour of the slip labelled  @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the players win if every player correctly announces the colour of his slip . with @xmath54 , </S>",
    "<S> this can be solved with the pointer - following algorithm and the players have success probability about 0.31 .    in the quantum setting </S>",
    "<S> , the players can win with probability one at the colour guessing game also , by changing the oracle ( [ eq : oracle ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath55 be the colour of the slip for player @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> define for @xmath51 and @xmath56 : @xmath57    now we use the protocol described in section [ imp ] with each player querying this new oracle @xmath52 times . </S>",
    "<S> if for player @xmath4 @xmath58 , then there is exactly one @xmath15 for which @xmath59 and grover s algorithm returns @xmath60 with probability one . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , if @xmath61 then @xmath62 is identically zero and grover s algorithm may return any value @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the player now makes one further call to oracle ( [ eq : oracle1 ] ) with the returned value @xmath15 and guesses red if the oracle returns one and blue otherwise .    </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : cheating ]    a cheating referee can obviously beat the players in the locker game . </S>",
    "<S> she simply has to omit the label of one of the players . </S>",
    "<S> this could be easily exposed by requiring that all the lockers be opened and checked at the end of the game .    </S>",
    "<S> a more subtle way of cheating is if the referee can somehow choose the permutation @xmath2 . in the original locker game , </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath63 , and let @xmath64 be a random unordered subset of @xmath65 players . </S>",
    "<S> she may set @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and fill out the rest of @xmath2 at random from the remaining players . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to verify that , using the pointer algorithm , player @xmath68 opens @xmath6 lockers @xmath69 and does not find his label . </S>",
    "<S> he has to guess and loses with probability about @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> the same thing happens for each of the players @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> ( incidentally , the reason for not choosing @xmath72 is that the players not finding their label may guess the locker number they see in the last locker they open , winning the game with probability one ! ) . </S>",
    "<S> using variants of this idea the referee may cheat successfully for some time before the players catch on . </S>",
    "<S> if the players have access to shared randomness ( which is unknown to the referee ) , they can circumvent this problem by first applying their own permutation on the lockers before opening any of them . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , our quantum protocol is impervious to a referee who maliciously chooses the permutation , and does not require shared randomness .    </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : conclusion ]    it was previously known that the locker puzzle has an intriguing classical optimal solution . </S>",
    "<S> now we know that the locker puzzle and its variants also have interesting quantum solutions which perform significantly better than the classical ones .    we have given a quantum solution in the black - box query complexity model that _ does not use the pointer - following technique that is crucial to the classical optimal solution_. it would be interesting to see if using the stronger classical oracle could lead to a quantum solution that works with a reasonable probability of success using  @xmath73 total queries . with this stronger oracle , </S>",
    "<S> perhaps shared entanglement could help the players ? </S>",
    "<S> it would also be interesting to see if , analogous to the classical case , our results have any consequences for time - space tradeoffs for data structures  @xcite . </S>"
