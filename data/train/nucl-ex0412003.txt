    "a central question to be answered by scientists at brookhaven national laboratory s relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is : if nuclei are collided together with high enough center - of - mass energy , is it possible to create matter in which quarks and gluons become deconfined  _ i.e. _ are colored objects able to roam over distances greater than hadronic length scales  @xcite ?",
    "lattice qcd calculations demonstrate that as the temperature of hadronic matter is increased above a critical value ( @xmath2 ) quark and gluon degrees - of - freedom become accessible .",
    "this is most graphically demonstrated by the results from ref .",
    "@xcite shown in fig .  [ lattice ] ( left ) where the energy density @xmath3 scaled by @xmath4 is shown for different values of @xmath5 .",
    "calculations of the quark anti - quark coupling @xmath6 indicate , however , that even at temperatures several times greater than @xmath2 , quarks and anti - quarks still feel effects of confinement  @xcite : _ i.e. _ `` remnants of confinement '' . fig .  [ lattice ] ( right ) shows the qcd coupling constant @xmath7 for static , heavy quark anti - quark pairs as a function of their separation @xmath8 for temperatures from @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "high - statistics lattice results from ref .",
    "@xcite for the coupling at @xmath11 are shown on the figure as a thick , black line .",
    "measurements indicate that in au+au collisions at top rhic energy , the energy density reaches values well above the critical energy density for deconfinement  @xcite . the fireball formed in these collisions rapidly expands and cools .",
    "if matter is formed with @xmath12 , these calculations suggest that as the matter cools and approaches @xmath2 from above , the forces of confinement will turn on gradually . in this case , the process by which quarks and gluons become confined ( _ i.e. _ hadronization ) may be significantly modified in comparison to cases where a deconfined matter is not formed  in which case hadronization will take place in vacuum and @xmath13 will have the form corresponding to the @xmath11 case shown as a thick , black line in fig .",
    "[ lattice ] .",
    "although the finite temperature calculations have only been made for static , heavy quark anti - quark pairs , the modifications to @xmath7 are likely to be robust and also present in the case of light quarks . as such ,",
    "* the best way to detect the presence of deconfined , colored matter in ultra - relativistic nuclear collisions _ may be _ to study how hadron formation is modified in au+au collisions compared to more elementary collisions * ( _ e.g. _ @xmath14 or @xmath15 collisions ) .    according to de broglie s relation ( @xmath16 ) the momentum @xmath17 of a probe and the corresponding length scale that it can resolve ( _ i.e. _ the wavelength @xmath18 )",
    "are inversely related .",
    "as the momentum transfer involved in scatterings increases , the resolution with which matter can be probed also increases . in nucleus - nucleus collisions at rhic",
    "it is not feasible to probe the collision system with an external probe ( as in scattering electrons or protons off the system formed after the gold ions collide ) .",
    "instead , we rely on the particles produced by the collision to probe the matter formed .    for particles produced with sufficiently large momentum , a picture of the collision system as being composed of point - like particles ( partons )",
    "should hold .",
    "most particles produced in nucleus - nucleus collisions , however , are at much lower momentum and their long _ wavelengths _ probe the bulk characteristics of the produced matter ( _ i.e. _ temperature , collective velocity , system - sizes , etc .",
    "@xcite ) . for momenta between the two extremes ( _ e.g. _ above 1 gev / c ) , one might expect to probe length scales that are commensurate with the systems constituents  whether hadrons , `` remnants of confinement '' , or constituent quarks  without yet reaching the limit where the most appropriate description of the system is that of point - like partons . if the momentum is too high , we ll probe the region of @xmath7 that , according to fig .  [ lattice ] , is independent of temperature . if the momentum is too low , we may not have sensitivity to the modifications shown in the figure . for these reasons , the kinematic range where we would most naturally expect to find",
    "evidence for modifications to hadron formation is just below the momentum scale where a partonic , point - like picture holds .",
    "three measurements from rhic in the intermediate @xmath19 range ( 1.5  gev / c @xmath20  gev / c ) point towards modifications to the process of hadron formation in au+au collisions :    * the nuclear modification factors  _ i.e. _ the ratio of yields in central au+au collisions compared to peripheral au+au ( @xmath21 ) or p+p ( @xmath22 ) collision scaled by the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions  @xcite . * the baryon - to - meson ratios  @xcite . * the anisotropy in azimuth of particle production relative to the reaction plane  _ i.e. _ the elliptic flow parameter @xmath23  @xcite .    fig .  [ rcp ] shows the nuclear modification factor @xmath21 measured with charged hadrons  @xcite , charged kaons , @xmath24s , @xmath25(892)s  @xcite , @xmath26s@xmath27s , and @xmath28s@xmath29s  @xcite . in the case that the centrality dependence of particle yields scales with the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions , @xmath21 will equal one . at @xmath30  gev / c , charged hadron yields in central collisions",
    "are suppressed from expectations by a factor of four .",
    "this suppression is taken as a signature of the quenching of jets in the bulk matter formed in central collisions .",
    "the charged and neutral kaons show a suppression and @xmath19 dependence similar to that of charged hadrons . by contrast , the @xmath21 values for @xmath26s@xmath27s and @xmath28s@xmath29s rise above the charged hadron values at @xmath31  gev / c and approach unity .",
    "they remain above charged hadron and kaon @xmath21 values until @xmath326  gev / c .",
    "similar observations were made by the phenix collaboration with proton @xmath22 rising above pion @xmath22 in a similar @xmath19 region  @xcite .",
    "@xmath21 values for baryons being greater than those of mesons signifies that baryon production increases with centrality ( and therefore collision overlap - density ) more quickly than meson production .",
    "when @xmath21 or @xmath22 values for different particle types take on the same value ( _ e.g. _ at @xmath306  gev / c ) , it means that the relative abundances of the different particles matches that observed in @xmath15 collisions . as such , the baryon - to - meson ratios in central au+au collisions at intermediate @xmath19 , must also reflect the same baryon excesses .",
    "[ b / m ] shows measurements of proton / pion , anti - proton / pion  @xcite and @xmath33/@xmath24  @xcite ratios as a function of @xmath19 for various centralities and collision systems . at intermediate @xmath19",
    ", a striking difference is observed between the baryon - to - meson ratios in central au+au collisions and those in @xmath14  @xcite or @xmath15 collisions  @xcite .",
    "the measurements in figs .",
    "[ rcp ] and [ b / m ] demonstrate that the process by which parton distributions are mapped onto hadron distributions is drastically different in au+au and @xmath15 collisions .",
    "as long as hadronization is not modified , a change to the underlying parton distributions will not lead to such a drastic change in the relative abundances .    in non - central nucleus - nucleus collisions ,",
    "the collision overlap region is elliptic in shape .",
    "secondary interactions , can convert this initial coordinate - space anisotropy to an azimuthal anisotropy in the final momentum - space distributions . that anisotropy is commonly expressed in terms of the coefficients from a fourier expansion of the azimuthal component of the invariant yield  @xcite . the second component ( the `` elliptic flow '' parameter @xmath23 ) is the largest and most commonly studied of the coefficients .",
    "[ v2 ] shows @xmath23 for pions , kaons , protons and lambda hyperons  @xcite . in the low momentum region ( @xmath34  gev / c )",
    ", @xmath23 is increasing with @xmath19  @xcite . in this region , for a given @xmath19 , the @xmath23 values are ordered by mass ; with more massive particles having smaller @xmath23 values  @xcite .",
    "this mass ordering is reasonably well described by the hydrodynamic model calculations  @xcite also shown in the figure .    for @xmath35  gev / c ,",
    "the data and model calculations deviate .",
    "the model over - predicts the measured @xmath23 values and the particle - type dependence reverses : the @xmath23 values for the more massive baryons are larger than those for the mesons . a model that relies on partonic , in - medium , energy - loss and vacuum fragmentation will predict smaller @xmath23 values when @xmath21 is closer to one  @xcite .",
    "the data , however , indicate that although protons , @xmath26s , and @xmath33s have @xmath21 values near unity , their maximum @xmath23 values exceed those of pions and kaons by approximately 50% .",
    "models that assume hadrons form via the coalescence of co - moving constituent - quarks , however , are able to simultaneously reproduce the particle - type dependencies of @xmath21 and @xmath36  @xcite . by extension , these models also account for the anomalously large baryon - to - meson ratios for central au+au collisions .",
    "coalescence models for hadronization predict that at intermediate @xmath19 , @xmath23 for different hadrons will follow a scaling law based on the number of valence quarks in the corresponding hadron ( @xmath37 ) : @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 are hadron @xmath23 , quark @xmath23 , hadron @xmath19 , and quark @xmath19 respectively .",
    "if this scaling holds then @xmath43 should fall on a universal curve . in these models",
    "this universal curve represents the @xmath23 value for the quark distributions prior to hadronization . in fig .",
    "[ v2scaling ] this scaling is tested by plotting @xmath23 versus @xmath19 , where both axes have been scaled by @xmath37 .",
    "a polynomial curve is fit to all the data and the ratio of the data to the universal curve is plotted in the bottom panel .",
    "very good agreement with the scaling prediction is found for all the hadron species except pions .",
    "the pion @xmath23 values deviate from the universal curve throughout the measured @xmath19 range and are not included in the fit .",
    "this deviation does not necessarily signal a violation of the scaling law because , the pion sample used to calculate @xmath23 is dominated by pions from resonance decays .",
    "although the effect of resonance decays on the @xmath23 for other hadrons has been found to be relatively small , the effect was found to significantly increase the measured pion @xmath23  @xcite .    the larger rate - of - increase for baryon production ( _ i.e. _ @xmath44 ) , the anomalously large baryon - to - meson ratios in au+au collisions , and the quark - number - scaling for @xmath23 , point to possible modifications of hadron formation in au+au collisions compared to p+p collisions .",
    "models in which hadronization occurs via coalescence of co - moving constituent quarks successfully account for these three observations  @xcite .",
    "these hadronization models demonstrate one way that the hadron formation process could be modified .",
    "whether these models remain successful as more precise measurements are made is still an open question .",
    "the evidence for modifications to hadronization from data , however , are clear and independent of the theoretical models .",
    "identified particle nuclear modification @xmath21 and elliptic flow @xmath23 measurements made in au+au collisions at rhic have revealed an apparent quark - number dependence in the @xmath19 region from 1.5  gev / c to 5  gev / c .",
    "the @xmath23 measurements follow a quark - number scaling predicted by models of hadron formation via coalescence of co - moving quarks .",
    "the @xmath21 measurements show that baryon production increases more rapidly with centrality than meson production  an observation that also supports a picture of hadron formation by quark coalescence or recombination . these observations are consistent with the presence of modifications to the hadronization process in au+au collisions compared to @xmath14 or @xmath15 collisions .",
    "a picture of hadron formation with an intermediate , constituent - quark step , is highly suggestive of the formation of deconfined quark - gluon matter .",
    "the modified hadron formation process points to a scenario where matter is created with a temperature above @xmath2 and then cools  approaching @xmath45 from above  until confinement is gradually re - enforced .",
    "lattice calculations of the qcd coupling constant @xmath46 for static quark anti - quark pairs show that this process is consistent with the equations of qcd . * these calculations and the empirical observations presented here",
    "demonstrate that modifications to the hadronization process in nuclear collisions are promising signatures for the creation of deconfined quark - gluon matter . *",
