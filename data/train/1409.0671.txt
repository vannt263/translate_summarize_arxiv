    "there are many examples of disordered solids that display a universal scaling form of the ac conductance  @xcite .",
    "this is seen if one considers the conductivity @xmath0 as function of frequency @xmath1 at different temperatures .",
    "it is found that the curves for different temperatures collapse on a single universal curve if scaled according to the following equation : @xmath2 such a scaling implies that the only relevant timescale in the system is @xmath3 .",
    "several models displaying this behavior have been studied  @xcite , including hopping models .",
    "however , electron - electron interaction was neglected and only the regime of nearest neighbor hopping was considered .",
    "it is therefore interesting to see if an interacting system displaying variable range hopping ( vrh ) will possess the same universality property .",
    "we have studied the standard 2d lattice model of hopping transport @xcite .",
    "it consist of a square lattice of @xmath4 sites .",
    "each of the sites can be either empty or occupied ( double occupancy is not allowed ) .",
    "the simulations were performed for the filling factor of @xmath5 , so that the number of electrons is half the number of sites .",
    "disorder is introduced by assigning a random energy in the range @xmath6 $ ] to each site ( in our numerics we have used @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the lattice constant ) .",
    "each site is also given a compensating charge @xmath9 so that the overall system is charge neutral .",
    "the charges interact via the coulomb interaction . in the following the unit of energy",
    "is chosen as the coulomb energy of unit charges on nearest neighbor sites , @xmath10 .",
    "the unit of temperature is then @xmath11 .",
    "it is known that this model shows vrh dc conduction according to the efros - shklovskii law , @xmath12 , in a rather broad temperature range  @xcite .    to simulate the time evolution we used the dynamic monte carlo method introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite for simulating dc transport .",
    "the only difference is that we apply an ac electric field @xmath13 and that , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we use for the transition of an electron from site @xmath14 to site @xmath15 the formula @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the energy of the phonon and @xmath18 is the distance between the sites .",
    "@xmath19 contains material dependent and energy dependent factors , which we approximate by their average value ; we consider it as constant and its value , of the order of @xmath20 s , is chosen as our unit of time .",
    "consequently , @xmath1 is measured in units of @xmath21 while the electric field is measured in units of @xmath22 .",
    "the algorithm works by starting from one configuration of electrons on the sites and then a random transition is chosen , weighted by the distance dependent part of the transition rate .",
    "then the jump is accepted or rejected based on the energy dependent part of the transition rate .",
    "to each jump there is also associated a time , @xmath23 , depending on the number of rejected trials before one is accepted  @xcite .",
    "this generates a random walk in the configuration space with statistical properties identical to the real time evolution of the system . to extract the conductivity from the contributions of the individual jumps we do as follows .",
    "the current density is @xmath24 which means that ignoring oscillating terms we will have    @xmath25    the program will tell which jump took place and what time it took .",
    "let @xmath26 be the distance jumped in the direction of the field , and @xmath27 be the time of jump number @xmath14 .",
    "then the current density is @xmath28 and we replace the integral with the sum    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the time at which jump @xmath14 took place . from this",
    "we get the conductivity @xmath31 .",
    "we have simulated the response to an ac electric field as function of frequency for different temperatures in the vrh regime ( parts of the numerical data were already presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in most cases we used @xmath32 , which is sufficient for the dc conductivity to be well defined and sample independent . only at frequencies",
    "@xmath33 was it necessary to use larger samples as the number of electrons that will jump during one period of the field becomes small and the data are noisy if too small samples are used . we compared @xmath34 and @xmath35 and found no significant difference , indicating that @xmath34 is sufficient . in all cases",
    "we have chosen @xmath36 which is in the upper range of ohmic response and therefore gives a large signal to noise ratio .     left : real part of ac conductivity as function of frequency .",

    "[ fig : condacscaling ] ( left ) .",
    "the general trend is the same at all temperatures : at low frequencies , the conductivity is frequency independent . at some frequency",
    "it will start to increase , and then saturate at high frequencies ( for all temperatures this happens around @xmath37 .",
    "looking at eq and recalling that @xmath38 is our unit of time , we understand that this happens when the frequency is higher thatn the highest rate in the system ) . to check the scaling form , eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , we replot the same data in fig . [",
    "fig : condacscaling ] ( right ) , which shows @xmath39 as function of @xmath40 . as can be seen , the curves fall on a common universal curve up to the point where they show a trend to saturation , @xmath41 .",
    "note that in this region the universal curve describes the values of @xmath0 differing by factor of @xmath42 .",
    "we see that we numerically confirm the scaling equation , but it is also interesting to see if the shape of the graph agrees with theoretical predictions .",
    "many different predictions have been made for the form of @xmath0 for different models and in various frequency regimes , see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "some of these predictions conform to the scaling form either exactly or approximately , and all rely on some approximate solution to the different models .",
    "we do not want to enter into a full description of the different theoretical graphs , but broadly speaking they fall into two groups .",
    "those that rely on some type of effective or homogeneous medium approximation and those based on percolation theory .",
    "there seems to be general agreement on the overall physical picture . in the dc limit",
    ", there is the percolation cluster on which the current flows , and with the critical resistors determining the overall conductivity . as the frequency increases ,",
    "the cluster breaks into smaller regions , and also clusters not on the percolation cluster starts to contribute to the conductivity . in the high frequency limit , only isolated pairs of sites with high rates are able to follow the oscillating field , and all traces of the percolation cluster are lost .",
    "it is therefore to be expected that effective medium approximations and expansions in small clusters will work better at high frequencies while percolation based methods are appropriate at low frequencies .",
    "we have fitted our numerical data to four different predictions for the universal graph discussed in ref .",
    "these are given by their eqs .",
    "( 13 ) , ( 25 ) , ( 26 ) and ( 28 ) .",
    "each function has an undetermined scaling of the frequency which has to be fitted to the numerical points .",
    "that is , they are given as functions of @xmath43 where @xmath44 is an undetermined parameter .",
    "figure [ fig : condacscalingmeddyre ] shows our numerical data together with the best fits to each model .",
    "the models were fitted as least squares fits to the logarithmic values of the @xmath45 points , excluding @xmath37 as this is where the curve saturates and deviates from the universal curve .",
    "note that the dca ( diffusion cluster approximation ) in principle has another free parameter , the fractal dimension of some poorly defined `` diffusion cluster '' .",
    "we have taken it as 1.35 as this was the best fitting value found from the numerics in ref .",
    "@xcite . by fitting to our data using this as an additional parameter we would very likely improve the fit .",
    "as we can see , all the curves are reasonably close to the numerical data , even if some can be argued as better than others .",
    "it is interesting to note that the two best fitting curves are the effective medium approximation ( ema ) and the percolation path approximation ( ppam ) which are at the opposite extremes in the set of models .",
    "the first assumes a homogeneous effective medium , whole the second assumes that all transport at all frequencies takes place an the dc percolation cluster and that other regions never make a significant contribution to the current .    real part of ac conductivity as function of frequency with best fits for each model .",
    "the four models are : effective approximation ( ema ) , eq .",

    "it is interesting to study the size and shape of conducting clusters as the frequency changes . in the dc limit",
    "there is the percolation network . as the frequency increases",
    ", the percolation cluster should break up into smaller regions , and areas not on the percolation cluster should start to contribute .",
    "we will find the links which give large contributions to the current . for each link @xmath46 ( that is , a connection between two specific sites in the system )",
    ", we sum all the contributions to the sum which comes from this link , let us call it @xmath47 .",
    "this includes jumps in both directions , and in the dc case , jumps in one direction are positive and in the other negative . for ac it depends on the direction of the field at the time a jump is made .",
    "we find that most sites have at least some activity , and there are only a few sites which are completely frozen .",
    "many of the links will only have a small number of jumps associated with it , or many jumps which are mainly thermally driven , and not related to the electric field .",
    "they will then give a small contribution to the sum .",
    "we want to exclude those links which do not give a large contribution to the sum which can be written @xmath48 where the sum is over all links in the system .",
    "let @xmath49 be a threshold and ignore all links which have @xmath50 .",
    "this means that we keep all that have a large absolute value , both positive and negative .",
    "let @xmath51 be the set of links that are kept with a particular value of @xmath49 , and define @xmath52 we specify a number @xmath53 $ ] and find @xmath54 such that @xmath55 .",
    "this means that we keep links such that the sum of the contributions from those links is a fraction @xmath56 of the total .",
    "we find that @xmath57 gives a good balance between reducing the number of active links while still keeping the important ones . in the following",
    "we will show results at @xmath57 , but the exact value should not affect the results too strongly .",
    "we look at the temperature @xmath58 and simulate @xmath59 jumps at each frequency .",

    "links in blue have @xmath61 while those in red have @xmath62 .",
    "figure [ fig : aktdo ] shows such activity maps for different frequencies .",
