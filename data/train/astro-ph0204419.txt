    "different experiments over the past few decades have detected several giant air showers , confirming the arrival of cosmic rays ( crs ) with energies up to a few hundred eev ( 1 eev @xmath1 ev)@xcite .",
    "the nature and origin of these energetic particles remain a mystery @xcite .",
    "crs , however , can not travel unaffected through inter - galactic space .",
    "the thermal photon background becomes highly blueshifted for ultra - relativistic protons , and the reaction @xmath2 , and similar others , effectively degrade the primary proton energy .",
    "this provides a strong constraint on the proximity of cr - sources , discovered early on by greisen , and by zatsepin & kuzmin , and referred to as the gzk cutoff @xcite .",
    "specifically , fewer than 20% of 300 eev ( 100 eev ) protons can survive a trip of 18 ( 60 ) mpc . for nuclei and photons",
    "the situation is , in general , more drastic @xcite .",
    "+ the possible solutions to this puzzle appear to fall into three broad categories , viz : 1 ) there are many nearby sources ( e.g. , based on a substantial present - epoch population of galaxies hosting core supermassive black holes ) .",
    "2 ) there are only a few nearby sources ( e.g. @xcite ) and particles are isotropized by strong deflections in galactic and/or extragalactic magnetic fields of micro - gauss strength , close to existing upper limits ( e.g. , see @xcite , also @xcite ) .",
    "3 ) the particles somehow travel relatively unhindered through the cosmic microwave background radiation field , either by virtue of being some exotic new kind of weakly photon - interacting entity , or by violating the lorentz symmetry of special relativity ( e.g. @xcite ) , or by an as yet unknown other effect .",
    "+ the arrival directions of the primary particles could be a useful source of information about the origin(s ) of crs .",
    "however , due to the small number of events , particularly at the highest energies , correlation studies are to be considered preliminary .",
    "for instance , the first five events observed with @xmath3 eev did in fact point toward high redshift radio - loud quasars , astrophysical environments that could well accelerate crs above the gzk energies via shock mechanisms ( see farrar and biermann , in ref .",
    "however , with the inclusion of subsequent data , this association now seems to have disappeared @xcite .",
    "+ in this communication we explore whether uhecrs can be in any way related to present - epoch supermassive black holes . to that end",
    ", we analyze what we can learn from the arrival directions of cosmic rays concerning their possible correlation with nearby massive dark objects , candidate qrs ( quasar remnants ) , and their underlying astrophysics .",
    "the compact dynamo model has been proposed as a natural mechanism for accelerating cosmic rays in such environments @xcite . in this model uhecrs",
    "are produced in nearby dead quasars harboring spinning supermassive black holes .",
    "the required emf is generated by the black hole induced rotation of externally supplied magnetic field lines threading the horizon .",
    "the observed flux of crs would apparently drain only a negligible amount of energy from the black hole dynamo , and particles up to at least 100 eev are expected .",
    "it is then interesting to ask if we are able to see any correlation between the sky position of these qrs and those of the highest energy crs , assuming different simple configurations for the intervening magnetic field .",
    "the nearby optical galaxy ( nog ) catalog of giuricin et al .",
    "@xcite is a complete magnitude - limited ( corrected blue total magnitude @xmath4 ) , distance - limited ( redshift @xmath5 ) sample of several thousand galaxies of latitude @xmath6 , with their morphology @xmath7 also provided @xcite .",
    "we shall impose very restrictive selection criteria , those necessary for obtaining candidate objects providing the most favorable setting for a black hole based compact dynamo model of uhecr production @xcite .",
    "the key goal of our strategy is to select _ a priori _ an nog subsample of galaxies that are likely to be quasar remnants .",
    "therefore , we are seeking optically bright galaxies whose luminosities are bulge dominated ( e.g. , giant ellipticals ) . imposing a gzk - related horizon of @xmath8 mpc assures that there are no quasars in our sample .",
    "we already know that the best determined ( and most massive ) black hole nuclei tend to be associated with bulge luminosities corresponding to @xmath9 and brighter ( for tables , see kormendy s website at http://chandra.as.utexas.edu/@xmath10kormendy/wwwbhtable-tech or the second reference in @xcite ) .",
    "+ firstly , then , we shall impose a cutoff in redshift , requiring all galaxies in our sample to be within @xmath11 , which for @xmath12 km / s / mpc corresponds to 40 mpc . since the crs detected",
    "are mostly in the northern hemisphere ( except those coming from sugar , which are not used in the present analysis ) , we shall impose the restriction that all qrs have equatorial latitudes north of @xmath13 deg .",
    "we further require the absolute blue magnitude to be brighter than @xmath14 ( for @xmath15 km / s / mpc ) and an rc3 ( _ third reference catalog of bright galaxies _ ) morphological type @xmath16 .",
    "a more negative @xmath7 indicates greater bulge prominence . in order to correlate the uhecr arrival directions with their putative qr origins",
    ", we require that these candidate qrs not lie within rich clusters ( those having more than 50 members )",
    ". some of the most massive qrs could reside in rich clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , all four qrs considered by boldt and loewenstein in ref .",
    "@xcite are in rich clusters ) , but the magnetic field strength in those clusters is presumably several micro - gauss @xcite ; hence , uhecrs originating in such qrs would be extremely deflected away from their sources .",
    "in addition , there are only a handful of galaxies within large clusters in the giuricin et al.s sample that survive all other constraints in order to be declared plausible quasar remnant candidates . using these selection criteria",
    ", we obtain a sample of 12 candidate qrs .",
    "these candidate qrs are listed in table 1 , and their astrophysical properties are analyzed below .",
    "+ the uhecr sample used is that obtained with agasa above 40 eev @xcite .",
    "there are 38 such events at @xmath17 ; the angular precision of their arrival directions was estimated as a circle of radius 1.6 degrees . for energies",
    "@xmath18 eev we also consider the 7 events observed at @xmath19 compiled by sigl et al .",
    "@xcite , 4 of which were obtained with agasa .",
    "we note that the statistical test we shall report was blind , i.e. we did not know beforehand if any of the qr galaxies were coincident with high energy cosmic rays .",
    "the simulation technique is the same as that used in refs . @xcite .",
    "+    [ tt0 ]    .sample of qr candidates , columns are the b1950 coordinates ( @xmath20 ) , name of the galaxy , richness of the group to which the galaxy pertains ( number of members ) , galactic longitude and latitude , mean redshift , corrected redshift ( against hubble distortions , using models of the peculiar velocity fields marinoni et al .",
    "@xcite ) , morphological type code ( rc3 ) , and absolute magnitude ( for @xmath21 = 75 ) .",
    "this table is based on data from the nog catalog of giuricin et al .",
    "provided to us by c. marinoni @xcite .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     note  black hole masses in the table are normally calculated from stellar velocity dispersions .",
    "those black hole masses taken from the literature are shown in parentheses , as are the quantities derived from them . a @xmath22 symbol stands for masses taken from van der marel 1999 , whereas a @xmath23 symbol , for masses taken from kormendy & gebhardt 2001 @xcite .",
    "these literature masses are corrected for our assumed distances .",
    "as recently suggested , quasar remnants are plausible sites of black - hole based compact dynamos that could be capable of accelerating protons up to ultra - relativistic energies .",
    "we have found that nearby quasar remnant candidates present an above - random positional correlation with the sample of uhecrs .",
    "the correlation appears on closer angular scales than those expected when taking into account the deflection caused by typically assumed intergalactic or galactic magnetic fields .",
    "possible scenarios producing this effect were discussed ; if real , the plausible fine structure of the galactic field may ultimately provide the basis for the most natural explanation . in order to substantiate and further investigate the apparent correlation reported here between qr candidates and cr arrival directions , we need a large , reliable sample of the most energetic uhecrs , those of the very highest magnetic rigidity .",
    "it is hard to claim a definitive correlation with few objects and crs constituting the samples .",
    "future experiments , such as the pierre auger observatory @xcite , euso @xcite and the nasa space - borne owl ( orbiting wide - angle light - collectors ) mission @xcite , should vastly increase the availability of uhecrs @xmath24 eev .",
    "as we have already noted , however , cr sources in rich galactic clusters ( those with pervasive micro - gauss fields ) are not well suited for our present kind of correlative investigation , even though the nearest qr candidates of interest reside in such systems .",
    "we suggest that qr candidates located within the relatively nearby virgo and fornax clusters @xcite might be best studied by means of the tev curvature radiation expected from the putative compact black - hole dynamos associated with these objects ( see second paper in @xcite ) .",
    "this work suggests that qrs should also be taken into account when analyzing coincidences in the forthcoming auger observatory .",
