    "flares observed with a @xmath2  day time scale are usually interpreted in terms of a relativistic shock moving through the jet with a lorentz factor of the order of @xmath3 ( e.g. maraschi , ghisellini & celloti  1992 , mannheim & biermann  1992 , dermer & schlickeiser  1993 , bednarek  1993 , sikora , begelman & rees  1994 , blandford & levinson  1995 , ghisellini & madau  1996 , protheroe  1997 ) .",
    "however , the production of such flares may also be a natural consequence of energization of particles in a way similar to that causing solar flares , but in this case occurring in regions of magnetic reconnection which may exist on the disk surface ( haswell , tajima & sakai  1992 , lesch & pohl  1992 ) .",
    "reconnection of magnetic field may also occur in the jet ( e.g. romanova & lovelace  1992 , bisnovatyi - kogan & lovelace  1995 ) .",
    "the processes of @xmath0-ray production by leptons accelerated in electric fields generated in the jet has been recently discussed by bednarek & kirk ( 1995 , henceforth bk95 ) and bednarek , kirk & mastichiadis ( 1996 , henceforth bkm96 ) .",
    "the acceleration of particles by almost rectilinear electric fields has some advantages in comparison to the stochastic acceleration by a relativistic shock since , in principle , particles can reach very high energies on shorter time scales . however , the process of reconnection of magnetic fields in astrophysical environments is poorly understood .",
    "recently , haswell , tajima & sakai ( 1992 ) have developed a model of explosive reconnection of magnetic fields on the surface of an accretion disk .",
    "they argued that particles ( electrons , protons ) can be accelerated to extremely high energies ( @xmath4 ev ) .",
    "the consequences of this model for @xmath0-ray production in blazars has been investigated recently by bednarek ( 1997 , henceforth b97 ) , assuming that accelerated leptons develop cascades in the magnetic field through production of @xmath0-rays by the synchrotron process , and by the creation of secondary pairs by @xmath0-rays in the magnetic field .",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectra , emerging from a region on the inner part of an accretion disk around a massive black hole , are in agreement with observations of blazars .    in this paper , we discuss the consequences of acceleration of protons in almost uniform electric fields induced by magnetic reconnection on the disk surface .",

    "let us assume that reconnection of the magnetic field occurs over a distance @xmath5 somewhere in the inner part of the optically thick accretion disk .",
    "the local radiation field in this region can be described by a black body spectrum with temperature @xmath6 .",
    "the induced electric field strength @xmath7 can be estimated as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the reconnecting magnetic field strength and @xmath10 is the velocity of light .",

    "protons accelerated in the electric field lose energy by @xmath14 pair and pion production in collisions with the black body photons after reaching the thresholds for these reactions .",
    "since the threshold for @xmath14 pair production is about two orders of magnitude lower than that for pion production , @xmath15 pairs are first injected into the electric field in the reconnection region .",
    "the characteristic distance scale @xmath16 ( in cm ) , for this process to occur efficiently , can be estimated by @xmath17 where @xmath18 @xmath19 is the cross section for @xmath14 pair production in collisions of protons with photons ( maximon  1968 , chodorowski , zdziarski & sikora  1992 ) , @xmath20 is density of the black body photons , and the local disk temperature in the reconnection region is expressed in units of @xmath21 k. we shall show later that this process is not an important energy loss mechanism for accelerated protons since its inelasticity coefficient is small ( @xmath22 ) .",

    "these protons can then produce pions in interactions with the disk radiation both during the acceleration stage and after emerging from the reconnection region , provided that the electric field is strong enough to allow them to reach energies , @xmath30 ( in ev ) , above the threshold for pion production , @xmath31 the characteristic distance scale for pion production by protons can be estimated by , @xmath32 where @xmath33 @xmath34 is the cross section for pion production in collisions of protons with photons ( stecker  1968 ) .",
    "comparison of @xmath35 with the characteristic distance scale of the reconnection region , which is the inner radius of an accretion disk @xmath36 , allows us to estimate the parameters of the accretion disk for which the proton energy losses by pion production become significant .",

    "the maximum proton energies , estimated using eq .  1 , can be expressed in terms of the temperature of the black body radiation in the reconnection region if we use the common assumption of equipartition of the magnetic and radiation energy densities close to the accretion disk .",

    "we consider a simple disk model in which the disk emits black body radiation with characteristic temperature depending on the distance from the disk center according to the model of shakura & sunyaev  ( 1973 ) .",
    "therefore , the disk radiation is defined by the disk inner radius @xmath47 and its temperature @xmath48 at @xmath36 .    in order to simulate the propagation of protons and the production of @xmath0-rays and neutrinos , we first determine the point of interaction of the proton with a soft photon coming from the disk .",

    "such pairs could contribute to the formation of a broad synchrotron bump at low energies observed in blazars .",
    "if protons are very close to the disk , their interaction length does not change significantly with distance @xmath71 from the disk . using the monte carlo method , the point of interaction of a proton with the disk photon",

    "the condition applied in order to distinguish between quasi - isotropic and anisotropic cases is this same as used in bednarek ( b97 ) ( see footnote on page 5 in that paper ) .",
    "having selected randomly the distance , @xmath74 , at which proton interacts with a disk photon , we have to sample the cosine angle , @xmath78 , of the photon from the disk which interacts with the proton .",
    "the possible range of photon directions ( from @xmath79 to @xmath80 , which corresponds to the outer disk radius ) is divided into one hundred intervals with width @xmath81 , corresponding to annular rings on the accretion disk centered on @xmath46 .",

    "finally we have to sample the energy of the disk photon coming from the ring @xmath85 for a proton located at a distance @xmath74 . to save computing time we approximate the black body spectrum of photons emitted at distance @xmath86 from the disk center by monoenergetic photons with energies corresponding to the mean photon energy of the black body spectrum , @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the boltzman constant , and @xmath89 , as predicted by shakura & sunyaev model .",

    "the @xmath15 pair energy losses by ics dominate over synchrotron losses , and the secondary @xmath14 pairs initiate ics @xmath14 pair cascades ( e.g. protheroe , mastichiadis & dermer  1992 , coppi , kartje & knigl  1993 ) . in the present work",
    "we discuss the case where the magnetic and disk radiation fields are initially in equipartition close to the surface .",
    "therefore the magnetic energy density dominates over the radiation energy density above the disk since the magnetic field drops more slowly with the distance from the disk than the radiation field ( bednarek , kirk & mastichiadis  1996b ) .",

    "[ fig6 ] we compare the @xmath0-ray spectrum , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5]a , with the observations of the flare from 3c 279 during june 1991 by the comptel , egret and ginga detectors ( williams et al .",
    "1995 , kniffen et al .",

    "the accompanying neutrino flare ( marked by the dashed curve ) corresponds to @xmath144 muon neutrinos per day per km@xmath145 with a typical energy of @xmath146 gev .",
    "such a flux , although small , may still be detectable since it is many orders of magnitudes above the neutrino background induced in the atmosphere within the @xmath147 ( lipari  1993 ) shown by the dot - dashed curve in fig .",
    "the detection probability of neutrino telescopes operating at this energy can be estimated to be @xmath148 ( gaisser , halzen & stanev  1995 ) , giving a rate of @xmath149 muons per day per km@xmath145 .",
    "therefore , for typical flares occurring on a time scale of a week one coincident neutrino event should be detected provided that the neutrino is massless . during a period of years",
    ", a large neutrino detector should be able to definitively answer the question of the importance of hadronic processes by measurements of correlations between neutrino arrival directions and directions to known fsrq blazars .",
    "the spectrum of neutrinos expected in this model is limited to a relatively narrow energy range if compared to other hadronic models ( e.g. protheroe  1997 , nellen , mannheim & biermann  1993 , mannheim  1995 , and comparison of different models in protheroe  1998 ) .",
    "the reason is that we have considered the case in which all hadrons are accelerated in the reconnection region to this same maximum energy , in contrast to other models mentioned in the section  1 , which assumed the injection of a power - law spectrum of protons .",
    "therefore , the shape of the neutrino spectrum may also give us important information on the acceleration mechanism of hadrons in blazars .",
    "some models of magnetized accretion disks predict the appearance of relatively small , but efficient , acceleration regions close to the surface of the inner part of the accretion disk as a result of magnetic reconnection ( haswell , tajima & sakai  1992 , lesch & pohl  1992 ) . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the consequences of acceleration of hadrons in such regions . depending on the conditions in the acceleration region , and above the disk ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , accelerated hadrons may either escape , initiate cascades after emerging from the acceleration region , or produce copious secondary leptons during the acceleration process which initiate subsequent leptonic cascading .",
    "primary leptons can also initiate cascades , and this possibility has been already discussed  ( b97 ) . in the analysis of hadronic cascades we included the processes of pion production by hadrons , synchrotron radiation of secondary @xmath15 pairs in the quantum domain , magnetic @xmath15 pair production by @xmath0-ray photons and absorption of the @xmath0-rays in the disk radiation .",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectra emerging from such a sequence of processes resemble the spectra observed from fsrq blazars ( figs  5 ) .",
    "their comparison with the june 1991 flare from 3c 279 allows one to predict the strength of the accompanying neutrino flare ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .    in the present model",
    "we have neglected the contribution of interactions of accelerated hadrons with the background matter , either during the acceleration stage , or after propagation through the disk radiation .",
    "interactions of relativistic protons with the disk radiation dominate over the interactions with matter if the density of matter @xmath150 is lower than @xmath151 if the density of matter is relatively high at larger distances from the disk , then protons , at this stage having lost most of their energy during propagation through the disk radiation , can also produce neutrinos by interactions with matter .",
    "these neutrinos are typically of lower energies , and their power will be much less than in the higher energy neutrinos from interactions with radiation .",
    "here we have considered only a single acceleration region in order not to complicate the picture too much . however , in principle many acceleration regions with different parameters could be present simultaneously on the disk surface .",
    "different types of cascades may then contribute to the observed @xmath0-ray spectrum from a specific blazar , and to the neutrino flux .",
    "if multiple reconnection sites do contribute , then the neutrino fluxes predicted for a single site should be considered as upper limits .",
    "however , a flare being produced by a single reconnection region seems to be equally probable given the likely short duration of each reconnection region ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "it is expected that as a result of magnetic reconnection a large amount of energetic plasma may enter the jet .",
    "therefore , the cascade processes taking place above the reconnection region should also occur in the jet plasma which moves with mildly relativistic speeds .",
    "hence , flares of the type discussed above may be accompanied by additional radiation processes caused by this energetic plasma .",
    "recent multiwavelength observations of mrk 501 argue that high energy processes in blazars are complicated ( see e.g. pian et al .",
    "1998 , protheroe et al .  1998 ) , and more than one different mechanism may be responsible for producing the observed photon spectrum .",
    "the motion of plasma , and additionally the longitudinal component of the magnetic field in the jet ( we do not include its influence on the final @xmath0-ray spectrum ) could provide collimation of the produced radiation in the direction perpendicular to the disk surface .    in conclusion",
    ", this model predicts that two types of high energy flares may occur if the particles ( hadrons , leptons ) are accelerated to high energies in reconnection regions on the accretion disk surface .",
    "pure @xmath0-ray flares can be caused either by secondary @xmath15 pairs produced during acceleration of protons which collide with the soft disk photons , or by primary leptons accelerated in the reconnection region .",
    "in this latter case , the @xmath0-ray spectrum can extend up to tev energies if the disk temperature is low enough . for large , luminous disks ,",
    "the magnetic field energy can be efficiently transferred to relativistic protons which can initiate @xmath0-ray and neutrino flares via production of pions in collisions with soft disk photons .",
    "therefore , we suggest that blazars of fsrq type , for which @xmath0-ray spectra show some evidence of a cut - offs at higher energies ( pohl et al .  1997 ) and features of large accretion disks ( emission lines ) , may become sources of gev @xmath0-rays and @xmath153 ev neutrinos .",
    "in contrast , bl lac objects , with spectra extending to tev energies , should not emit high energy neutrinos according to the present model .",
