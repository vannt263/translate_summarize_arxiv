    "the `` forest '' of  absorption systems observed in the spectra of background qsos traces neutral hydrogen gas to redshifts @xmath17 .",
    "because galaxies in the local universe possess extended neutral hydrogen gas ( e.g.  van gorkom 1993 ) , some fraction of the observed  absorption systems must arise in individual galaxies . whether or not this is a dominant fraction is crucial for understanding the origin of  absorption systems , and understanding the origin of  absorption systems bears significantly on all efforts to apply the  forest as a probe of tenuous gas around galaxies over the redshift interval probed by the  absorption systems . over the past decade ,",
    "comparison of galaxies and  absorption systems along common lines of sight has shown that low - redshift  absorption systems are associated with intervening galaxies ( e.g.  morris et al .",
    "1993 ) , but whether these absorbers arise in individual galaxies or merely trace the large - scale galaxy distribution is still a matter of some debate ( lanzetta et al .  1995 ;",
    "stocke et al .  1995 ; bowen , blades , & pettini 1996 ; le brun , bergeron , & boiss 1996 ; van gorkom et al .",
    "1996 ; shull , stocke , & penton 1996 ; tripp , lu , & savage 1998 ; chen et al .  1998 ;",
    "impey , petry , & flint 1999 ) .    over the past several years , we have been conducting an imaging and spectroscopic survey of faint galaxies in fields of hubble space telescope ( hst ) spectroscopic target qsos ( lanzetta et al .",
    "1995 ; lanzetta , webb , & barcons 1995 , 1996 , 1997 , 2001 ; barcons , lanzetta , & webb 1995 ; chen et al .",
    "the goal of the survey is to determine the gaseous extent of galaxies and the origin of qso absorption systems by directly comparing galaxies and qso absorption systems along common lines of sight .",
    "we have so far identified 352 galaxies of apparent magnitude @xmath18 at redshifts @xmath19 , and 230  absorption systems with rest - frame absorption equivalent width @xmath20 and 36  absorption systems with rest - frame absorption equivalent width @xmath21 at redshifts @xmath22 in 24 qso fields .",
    "impact parameters ( i.e.   projected distances ) of the galaxies to the qso lines of sight range from @xmath23 kpc to @xmath24 kpc .",
    "the galaxy and absorber pair sample is therefore unique for studying the relationship between both  and  absorption systems and galaxies . in this paper",
    ", we address the relationship between  absorption systems and galaxies ; we address the relationship between  absorption systems and galaxies in a separate paper ( chen , lanzetta , & webb 2000 ) .",
    "the first results of the survey presented by lanzetta et al .",
    "( 1995 ) based on 11 galaxy and  absorber pairs and 13 galaxies that do not produce corresponding  absorption lines to within sensitive upper limits in six qso fields showed that there is a distinct anti - correlation between   absorption equivalent width and galaxy impact parameter , although the scatter about the mean relationship is substantial .",
    "this distinct anti - correlation strongly indicates that most luminous galaxies possess extended gaseous envelopes , but the large scatter about the mean relationship indicates that the gaseous extent of galaxies may depend on other galaxy properties in addition to galaxy impact parameter .",
    "to determine how the extent of tenuous gas around galaxies scales with galaxy properties is crucial not only for discriminating among competing models of the origin of tenuous gas ( e.g.  rauch 1998 and references therein ) but also for applying the statistics of  absorption systems to constrain the statistics of faint galaxies over the redshift interval probed by the  absorption systems .    to address this issue ,",
    "we have conducted a program to obtain and analyze images of galaxies in 19 qso fields , using the hst wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) with the f702w and f606w filters and the nasa 3  m infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) on mauna kea with the @xmath25 filter .",
    "the primary objectives of the program are ( 1 ) to study how the incidence and extent of tenuous gas around galaxies depends on galaxy properties , including perhaps galaxy luminosity , size , or morphological type , ( 2 ) to study the spatial distribution of extended gas around galaxies , e.g.  whether tenuous gas is distributed around galaxies in flattened disks ( in which case absorption should occur preferentially in galaxies of low inclination angle ) or in spherical halos ( in which case absorption should be independent of galaxy inclination and orientation ) , and ( 3 ) to determine whether extended gas around galaxies arises as a result of galaxy interactions , as evidenced by disturbed morphologies or the presence of close companions .    initial results of the program based on 87 galaxies identified in ten qso fields have been published by chen et al .",
    "( 1998 ; hereafter paper i ) . in that paper , we presented a two - dimensional surface brightness profile analysis of hst wfpc2 images of the galaxies to measure galaxy @xmath3-band luminosity , effective radius , mean surface brightness , inclination and orientation of the disk component , axial ratio of the bulge component , and disk - to - bulge ratio .",
    "in addition , we presented an anti - correlation analysis to study the dependence of gaseous extent of galaxies on the measurable galaxy parameters .",
    "we found that ( 1 ) the amount of gas encountered along the line of sight depends on the galaxy impact parameter and @xmath3-band luminosity but does not depend strongly on the galaxy mean surface brightness , disk - to - bulge ratio , or redshift , ( 2 ) spherical halos can not be distinguished from flattened disks based on the galaxy and absorber sample , and ( 3 ) there is no evidence that galaxy interactions play an important role in distributing tenuous gas around galaxies in most cases . the statistically significant scaling relation between   absorption equivalent width and galaxy luminosity further supported the hypothesis that the absorbers trace tenuous gas in individual halos surrounding the galaxies rather than tenuous gas in galaxy groups or large - scale filaments around the galaxies .    in this paper",
    ", we present complete results of the program , including hst wfpc2 photometry for an additional 68 galaxies in the remaining nine qso fields and near - infrared photometry for 75 galaxies in 15 of the 19 qso fields .",
    "the new near - infrared galaxy photometry complements the optical galaxy photometry and helps to interpret the results of the anti - correlation analysis , because , while galaxy @xmath3-band luminosity is a measure of recent star - forming activity , galaxy @xmath5-band luminosity is a more sensitive measure of total stellar mass , which may be a more fundamental factor ( in comparison with recent star formation activity ) in scaling the extent of tenuous gas around galaxies . by supplementing the optical photometric measurements of the additional galaxies and including near - infrared galaxy photometry , we further examine whether or not the results of previous analysis may be retained and improved .",
    "comparison of galaxies and absorbers identified in the 19 qso fields yields 40 galaxies that are associated with corresponding  absorption lines and 47 galaxies that do not produce corresponding  absorption lines to within sensitive upper limits .",
    "galaxy and absorber pairs are considered to be physically correlated if ( 1 ) the galaxy  absorber cross - correlation amplitude satisfies @xmath0 and ( 2 ) the galaxy impact parameter satisfies @xmath1 kpc . including only galaxy and absorber pairs that are likely",
    "to be physically associated and excluding galaxy and absorber pairs within 3000  of the background qsos leaves 34 galaxy and absorber pairs and 13 galaxies that do not produce corresponding  absorption lines to within sensitive upper limits .",
    "redshifts of the galaxy and absorber pairs range from @xmath9 to 0.8920 with a median of @xmath10 , and impact parameter separations of the galaxy and absorber pairs range from @xmath11 to @xmath12 kpc with a median of @xmath13 kpc . of the 47 galaxies ,",
    "15 ( 32% ) are of @xmath3-band luminosity @xmath14 with redshifts ranging from @xmath26 to 0.6350 , and six ( 13% ) are of low surface brightness with redshifts ranging from @xmath26 to 0.3180 .",
    "the galaxy sample is therefore representative of the galaxy population over a large fraction of the hubble time .",
    "based on the new larger galaxy and absorber pair sample , we confirm that the amount of gas encountered along the line of sight depends on the galaxy impact parameter and @xmath3-band luminosity but does not depend strongly on the galaxy mean surface brightness , disk - to - bulge ratio , or redshift .",
    "in addition , we find that ( 1 ) the gaseous extent of galaxies scales with galaxy @xmath5-band luminosity as @xmath27 , ( 2 ) tenuous gas is more likely to be distributed in spherical halos than in flattened disks , and ( 3 ) typical @xmath7 galaxies are surrounded by extended gas of radius @xmath8 kpc and covering factor ( within @xmath28 kpc ) of @xmath29 94% . because galaxies of all morphological types possess extended gaseous halos and because the extent of tenuous gas around galaxies scales with galaxy @xmath5-band luminosity , we conclude that galaxy mass  rather than recent star - formation activity  is likely to be the dominant factor that determines the extent of tenuous gas around galaxies .",
    "but because galaxy @xmath5-band luminosity is strongly correlated with galaxy @xmath3-band luminosity ( at least for galaxies at redshifts @xmath30 ) , we also demonstrate on the basis of the scaling relation between the extent of  absorbing gas around galaxies and galaxy @xmath3-band luminosity that the number density evolution of  absorption systems may serve to constrain the measurements of the cosmic star formation rate density .",
    "we adopt a standard friedmann cosmology of dimensionless hubble constant @xmath31 km s@xmath32 mpc@xmath33 and deceleration parameter @xmath34 throughout this paper .",

    "the scaling relationship between the extent of tenuous gas around galaxies and galaxy luminosity provides a means of quantitatively relating statistical properties of  absorption systems to statistical properties of faint galaxies .",
    "we have pointed out in paper i that given a known galaxy population and the known scaling relation we can estimate the fraction of  absorption systems that originate in extended gaseous halos of galaxies .",
    "but we have also demonstrated that the prediction may vary from 30% to 100% .",
    "the large uncertainty is primarily due to the uncertainties in the normalization and the faint - end slope of the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "the result also reflects the generic difficulty in understanding galaxy formation and evolution based on comparisons of observational quantities obtained from magnitude - limited galaxy surveys ( which suffer from various selection biases ) and theoretical predictions .",
    "as discussed by chen , lanzetta , & fernndez - soto ( 2000 ) , the predicted number density of  absorption systems arising in the extended gaseous halos of galaxies may be given by @xmath529 where @xmath530 is the speed of light , @xmath531 is the galaxy luminosity function , @xmath45 is the  absorbing gas cross section that scales with galaxy @xmath3-band luminosity , @xmath516 is the halo covering factor , and @xmath514 is the fraction of galaxies that produce corresponding   absorption systems . substituting the scaling relationship according to equations ( 15 ) , ( 16 ) , and ( 17 ) , and adopting the result of    7.1",
    "that most galaxies are surrounded by extended gaseous halos of @xmath528 kpc radius with a roughly unity covering factor , we find @xmath532    for comparison , the comoving @xmath3-band luminosity density is defined as @xmath533 we can therefore relate the predicted number density of  absorption systems with @xmath534 by @xmath535 where @xmath536 accounts for the departure of the mean absorption gas cross section averaged over galaxies of different luminosities per unit comoving volume from the comoving @xmath3-band luminosity density and is defined as @xmath537 performing these integrals , we find @xmath538 where @xmath539 is the gamma function .",
    "it appears that the number density evolution of  absorption systems traces the evolution of the comoving galaxy @xmath3-band luminosity density .",
    "although the results of the analysis presented in    6.2 indicate that galaxy mass ( as probed by galaxy @xmath5-band luminosity ) , rather than recent star formation activity ( as probed by galaxy @xmath3-band luminosity ) is the dominant factor that determines the gaseous extent around galaxies , we argue that equation ( 28 ) is valid so long as the strong correlation between galaxy @xmath5-band and @xmath3-band luminosities seen in our survey ( figure 7 ) remains for galaxies at higher redshifts .    comparing the measurements of the  absorption line density obtained by weymann et al .",
    "( 1998 ) at redshifts @xmath540 with the ones obtained by bechtold ( 1994 ) at redshifts @xmath541 ( see chen et al .",
    "2000 ) , we find that the number density of  absorption systems increases gradually with redshift , implying a steadily increasing comoving @xmath3-band luminosity density over the entire redshift range ( @xmath542 ) .",
    "the predicted shallow slope of the comoving @xmath3-band luminosity density as a function of redshift at redshifts @xmath543 ( where the scaling relation between the gaseous extent of galaxies and galaxy @xmath3-band luminosity is well understood and measured ) agrees better with the results presented by cowie , songaila , & barger ( 1999 ) , but disagrees with the steep slope presented by lilly et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "it is in a broad agreement with recent measurements of luminosity density evolution at higher redshifts ( pascarelle et al .",
    "1998 ; steidel et al .",
    "namely , the comoving galaxy luminosity density does not fall off at redshifts beyond @xmath544",
    ".    an accurate assessment of luminosity density evolution bears importantly on discriminating between different galaxy formation scenarios ( e.g.  somerville & primack 1998 ) .",
    "a flat or steadily increasing galaxy luminosity density would imply that the bulk of star formation occurs much earlier ( c.f .",
    "madau , pozzetti , & dickinson 1998 ) , which would present a serious challenge to the hierarchical formation model .",
    "we have demonstrated that if ( 1 ) all the observed  absorption systems of neutral hydrogen column density @xmath545  arise in extended gaseous halos around galaxies and ( 2 ) the scaling relation applies to absorbers at all redshifts , then the number density evolution of  absorption systems may serve to constrain the measurements of cosmic star formation rate density .",
    "we present complete results of a program to obtain and analyze hst wfpc2 images and ground - based @xmath25 images of galaxies identified in an imaging and spectroscopic survey of faint galaxies in fields of hst spectroscopic target qsos .",
    "we measure properties of 142 galaxies , of which 40 are associated with corresponding  absorption systems and 47 do not produce corresponding  absorption lines to within sensitive upper limits .",
    "the galaxy and absorber pair sample is about 50% larger than the one previously published in paper i. we repeat the likelihood analysis to examine whether or not the results of previous analysis may be retained and further improved by including additional measurements .",
    "following paper i , we consider galaxy and absorber pairs physically correlated if ( 1 ) the galaxy  absorber cross - correlation amplitude satisfies @xmath0 and ( 2 ) the galaxy impact parameter satisfies @xmath546 kpc . including only galaxy and absorber pairs that are likely",
    "to be physically associated and excluding galaxy and absorber pairs within 3000  of the background qsos leaves 34 galaxy and absorber pairs and 13 galaxies that do not produce corresponding  absorption lines to within sensitive upper limits .",
    "redshifts of the galaxy and absorber pairs range from @xmath9 to 0.8920 with a median of @xmath10 , and impact parameter separations of the galaxy and absorber pairs range from @xmath11 to @xmath547 kpc with a median of @xmath13 kpc . of the 47 galaxies ,",
    "15 ( 32% ) are of @xmath3-band luminosity @xmath14 with redshifts ranging from @xmath26 to @xmath462 , and six ( 13% ) are of low surface brightness with redshifts ranging from @xmath26 to @xmath466 .",
    "we confirm the results previously published in paper i with improved statistics that the amount of gas encountered along the line of sight depends on the galaxy impact parameter @xmath60 , galaxy @xmath3-band luminosity @xmath426 , but does not depend strongly on the galaxy mean surface brightness @xmath548 , disk - to - bulge ratio @xmath63 , or redshift @xmath429 and that there is no evidence that galaxy interactions play an important role in distributing tenuous gas around galaxies in most cases .",
    "furthermore , we find that :    \\1 .",
    "the anti - correlation between  absorption equivalent width @xmath79 and galaxy impact parameter @xmath60 accounting for galaxy @xmath5-band luminosity @xmath488 is superior to the fiducial relationship between @xmath79 and @xmath60 .",
    "we conclude that the amount of gas intercepted along the line of sight depends on galaxy @xmath5-band luminosity which , together with the fact that galaxies of all morphological types possess extended gaseous halos , indicates that galaxy mass is likely to be the dominant factor that determines the extent of tenuous gas around galaxies .",
    "the relationship between galaxy gaseous radius @xmath502 and galaxy @xmath5-band luminosity @xmath488 may be described by @xmath509 with @xmath510 and @xmath511 for a  absorption equivalent width threshold @xmath507  .",
    "the @xmath549 case ( no dependence of gaseous radius on galaxy @xmath5-band luminosity ) can be ruled out at the @xmath550 level of significance .",
    "\\3 . at the rest - frame absorption",
