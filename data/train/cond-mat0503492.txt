    "the effective heisenberg exchange splitting @xmath14 is a function of time @xmath15 , which is measured as the difference in the energy between the spin - triplet state with the total spin @xmath16 and the spin - singlet state with @xmath17 .",
    "the `` state swap time '' is @xmath18 .",
    "an accurate treatment of the singlet - triplet splitting @xmath9 and the degree of entanglement carried by the two electrons is thus of outmost importance for this proposed approach to quantum computations .",
    "theoretical models , however , differ in their assessment of the magnitude and even the sign of the singlet - triplet energy difference @xmath9 that can be realized in a quantum dot molecule ( qdm ) with two electrons .",
