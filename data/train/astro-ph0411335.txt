    "a be / x - ray binary can be trivially defined as a binary system containing a be star , which , for some reason , produces x - ray emission .",
    "modern reviews of the properties of be / x - ray binaries can be found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* concentrating on x - ray properties ) and ( * ? ? ? * mainly optical observations ) .",
    "a be star is trivially defined as `` a non - supergiant b - type star whose spectrum has , or had at some time , one or more balmer lines in emission '' @xcite . however , such trivial definitions are necessarily too broad .",
    "if we want to define a class of objects with common physical characteristics , these definitions need some qualification .    for a start",
    ", we concentrate on _ `` classical be stars '' _ , early - type ( mostly b - type , but also late o - type ) stars which show emission lines because they are surrounded by a disk of material lost from their equator ( see @xcite for a recent review ; see also @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the mass loss in a classical be star is due to causes intrinsic to the star itself ( though binary companions , when present , may have some triggering effect ; cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in a be / x - ray binary ,",
    "emission lines should be associated with a classical be star and come from such a _ decretion disk _ @xcite .",
    "a system like the black hole candidate lmc x-3 @xcite is not a be / x - ray binary , as the emission lines most likely come from an accretion disk around the black hole .",
    "the case of the bright transient a0538@xmath066 is less clear , as it looks like a be star during quiescence states , but has a spectrum completely different from a be star when in outburst @xcite and displays optical variability unprecedented in a be star @xcite .    at present , we know the optical counterparts of @xmath1 be / x - ray binaries in the galaxy and @xmath2 in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) . a relatively up - to - date list of massive x - ray binaries , with their properties , is given by @xcite and a recent list of be / x - ray binaries and candidate is provided by @xcite .",
    "all the counterparts have spectral type earlier than b2 @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    ", the spectral distribution of the counterparts is very strongly peaked around spectral types b0-b0.5 @xcite , suggesting that they all have similar masses .",
    "it is important to note that isolated be stars do also display x - ray emission .",
    "early - type ( @xmath3b2 ) stars in general show x - ray emission with @xmath4 ( see @xcite ; see also @xcite ; @xcite ) and be stars may be marginally brighter @xcite . in order to have an x - ray binary",
    ", the main x - ray source must not be the be star , but a binary companion , specifically a _ compact companion _ : a white dwarf , neutron star or black hole ( a general review of the properties of x - ray binaries can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "the compact companion has no immediate observational signatures apart from the x - ray emission .",
    "the optical / infrared flux is completely dominated by the be star @xcite .",
    "this results in a fundamental observational bias : an object is recognised as a be / x - ray binary because it shows an x - ray flux higher than expected for an isolated be star of its spectral type . considering the uncertainties in the x - ray flux",
    "expected , and more importantly , in the distance and reddening derived to a single star , it is relatively difficult to establish whether a given star fulfils this criterion . objects displaying an @xmath5 much higher than an isolated be star are readily identified as be / x - ray binaries , while objects only one or two orders of magnitude brighter than an isolated be star fall into a `` grey zone '' , where their binary nature is difficult to ascertain . because of this , the population of objects well studied  and even the population of objects known  is strongly biased toward high @xmath5 sources , even if they show up as such only sporadically .",
    "if we can accumulate enough photons , we can always look for signatures of the compact companion in the x - rays , such as a characteristic x - ray spectrum , or x - ray pulsations .",
    "with sufficient monitoring , tell - tale variability may be detected .",
    "a determination of @xmath6 ( which , of course requires observations over a few years ) may allow the differentiation between a neutron star and a white dwarf .",
    "so with unlimited observing time on very sensitive x - ray telescopes , the observational bias toward high @xmath5 systems could perhaps be removed , but , as we stand , it is very obviously present and , for many weak x - ray sources , we simply do not know if they are be / x - ray binaries or not .",
    "so far , all be / x - ray binaries that have been observed with sufficient sensitivity have revealed the signatures of a neutron star .",
    "indeed , x - ray pulsations have always been found , the only exception being the microquasar 1e0236.6 + 6100 ( see below ) .    a final question to consider is the origin of the x - ray emission . traditionally ,",
    "one talks of x - ray binaries when the physical mechanism producing the x - rays is accretion on to a compact object .",
    "there are cases , however , when other sources of energy are available .",
    "one clear example is the radio pulsar psr  b1259@xmath063 , which orbits the be star ls  2883 @xcite .",
    "the neutron star is young and powered by dissipation of rotational energy .",
    "x - rays are believed to originate in shocks at the interface between the pulsar wind and the disk of the be star ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "another system that could be powered by rotational energy is the 34-ms pulsar sax  j0635 + 0533 @xcite .",
    "the microquasar 1e0236.6 + 6100 could be similar to psr  b1259@xmath063 @xcite , though an accretion - powered source is currently favoured @xcite .",
    "all these objects have properties widely differing from those of the majority of be / x - ray binaries and will thus be excluded from the following , where we concentrate on systems containing _ an x - ray pulsar accreting from the disk of a classical be star . _",
    "as mentioned , all be / x - ray binaries , when observed with sufficient sensitivity , display x - ray pulsations , a signature of the strong magnetic field ( @xmath7 g ) of a neutron star .",
    "the presence of x - ray pulsations allows the determination of the orbital parameters of the system , such as the orbital period , @xmath8 , and eccentricity , @xmath9 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray spectra of be / x - ray binaries are very similar to those of other accreting x - ray pulsars , as they depend mostly on the physical conditions close to the neutron star ( cf .",
    "they can generally be characterised by broken power laws , with a high - energy cutoff and absorption at low energies due to interstellar material @xcite . in a few systems with low interstellar absorption",
    ", there is evidence for a soft blackbody component at low energies @xcite .",
    "the first be / x - ray binaries were identified as bright x - ray transient sources @xcite , but , as new systems were discovered , very different behaviours were observed .",
    "some be / x - ray binaries are persistent x - ray sources ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , displaying low luminosity ( @xmath10 ) at a relatively constant level ( varying by up to a factor of @xmath11 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "most known be / x - ray binaries ( though this is likely a selection effect ) undergo outbursts in which the x - ray luminosity suddenly increases by a factor @xmath12 .",
    "a given transient can show one or both of the two kinds of outbursts ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    * x - ray outbursts of moderate intensity ( @xmath13 erg s@xmath14 ) occurring in series separated by the orbital period ( type i or normal ) , generally close to the time of periastron passage of the neutron star . in most systems",
    ", the duration of normal outbursts seems related to the orbital period . *",
    "giant ( or type ii ) x - ray outbursts ( @xmath15 erg s@xmath14 ) lasting for several weeks or even months . generally , type ii outbursts start shortly after periastron passage , but do not show any other correlation with orbital parameters @xcite . in some systems , the duration of the type ii outbursts seems to be correlated with their peak intensity , but this is not always the case ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    during giant outbursts , and sometimes during normal outbursts , the spin period of the neutron star",
    "is observed to increase ( neutron star _",
    "spin - up _ ) , indicating that angular momentum is efficiently transfered from the material accreted to the neutron star , most likely through an accretion disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray spectra of persistent sources show some differences with respect to those of transients in outburst @xcite .",
    "moreover , all persistent sources have relatively long pulse periods , @xmath16s , while transients have periods ranging from less than one second to several hundred seconds .",
    "be / x - ray binaries fall within a narrow area in the @xmath17/@xmath18 diagram ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this correlation between @xmath17 and @xmath18 is generally interpreted as meaning that the neutron stars in be / x - ray binaries rotate at the equilibrium velocity between the spin - up caused by accreted matter and the spin down caused by the centrifugal effect of their strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the correlation is loose , and there are some clear exceptions ( for instance , x0726@xmath0260 ; @xcite ) .",
    "as mentioned above , the optical / infrared properties of be / x - ray binaries are those of the be star , and so very similar to those of isolated be stars : emission in the balmer lines and some singly - ionised metallic lines , infilling or emission in the hei lines and an infrared excess with respect to b - type stars of the same spectral type , resulting in photometric variability ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in be / x - ray binaries , the maximum strength of h@xmath19 ever measured correlates with the size of the orbit , measured through @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this is understood as a consequence of the interaction between the neutron star and the disk of the be star . in the truncated viscous disk model @xcite , the tidal torque of the neutron star truncates the disk at the resonances between the orbital periods of disk particles and the neutron star . as a consequence",
    ", material accumulates in the disk , explaining why the disks of be / x - ray binaries appear denser than those of isolated be stars @xcite .",
    "this situation is necessarily unstable and will eventually lead to major perturbations in the disk structure .",
    "such perturbations will result in the onset of the giant outbursts @xcite .    in several systems ,",
    "we observe relatively quick ( a few years ) quasi - periodic cycles , during which the disk forms , grows , gives rise to x - ray activity and then disappears ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the well - studied system 4u0115 + 63 ,",
    "these quasi - cycles are highly repeatable @xcite . as the mechanisms involved are rather complex , the correlation between the optical and infrared lightcurves and the x - ray lightcurves are rather loose ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "similar quasicycles are observed in isolated be stars , though they tend to last longer than in be / x - ray binaries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the size of the truncated disk depends strongly on the orbital parameters of the system , notably the semi - major axis and @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath9 is large , truncation is not very effective and the be / x - ray binary is expected to display type i outbursts at every periastron passage ( similarly to exo2030 + 375 in fig .  1 ) .",
    "if @xmath9 is low , truncation is very effective and activity should be rare . in intermediate cases , more complex behaviour is expected @xcite .",
    "x  per , the prototypical persistent source , is known to have a wide , low-@xmath9 orbit @xcite .",
    "because of their long @xmath20 and the @xmath8/@xmath21 correlation , all _ persistent _ be / x - ray binaries are believed to have similar orbits .",
    "the existence of be / x - ray binaries with both low and high values of @xmath9 has a bearing on models for their formation @xcite and may even have implications for our understanding of supernovae @xcite .",
    "be / x - ray binaries are thought to be the product of the evolution of a binary containing two moderately massive stars , which undergoes mass transfer from the originally more massive star on to its companion ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as such , they are necessarily young and trace recent star formation .    be / x - ray binaries are very numerous .",
    "extrapolations from the observed numbers suggest that there are a few thousands of them in the galaxy @xcite , while estimates based on population synthesis models predict that the number of b - type stars with a neutron star companion is @xmath2210,000 @xcite .",
    "some authors have assumed that the mass transfer phase leading to the formation of the be / x - ray binary necessarily forces the b - type companion of a neutron star to be a be star .",
    "this is at present not an obvious conclusion ( see discussion in @xcite ) and it may well be that the majority of these systems can never be seen as x - ray sources : if the b - type star is not in a be phase , the neutron star has nothing to accrete .    a major discrepancy between population synthesis models and observations",
    "are the relative numbers of be / x - ray binaries ( be + neutron star ) and their lower @xmath5 relatives , the be + white dwarf ( wd ) binaries .",
    "all models predict very large numbers of be+wd systems , in most cases outnumbering be / x - ray binaries by a factor @xmath2 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , though there are a few candidates to be be+wd binaries @xcite , so far no system has been unambiguously confirmed to be a be+wd binary by observations .",
    "there are strong selection effects against the detection of be+wd binaries . for a start",
    ", their expected @xmath5 is not much higher than that of an isolated be star .",
    "their relatively soft x - ray spectra are strongly affected by interstellar absorption , meaning that it becomes difficult to differentiate them from weak be / x - ray binaries with neutron stars in wide orbits ( and hence slow pulsations ) . in spite of this , because of their large numbers , we should expect to have found some in our immediate neighbourhood , but searches for them have so far failed @xcite , rendering population synthesis models somewhat suspect .",
    "for the last few years , observations with a new generation of x - ray telescopes offering good spatial resolution have revealed the presence of a huge population of be / x - ray binaries in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ; cf .",
    "@xcite ) . to date , there are close to 40 x - ray pulsars in the smc @xcite . all of them , except smc x-1 , are be / x - ray binaries .",
    "such large population of objects at a given distance , with similar chemical composition , and very little affected by interstellar absorption renders the smc the perfect laboratory to study be / x - ray binaries .",
    "the main limitation of the smc is its large distance .",
    "dedicated pointings with x - ray telescopes are needed to detect x - ray pulsations and existing and previous all sky monitors do not detect or resolve its sources .",
    "for this reason , knowledge of the orbital parameters of smc be / x - ray binaries is almost null .",
    "however , some promising techniques are being developed . @xcite",
    "have shown that , because of the @xmath8/@xmath21 correlation , there is a good statistical correlation between the maximum observed @xmath5 and @xmath21 , which can hence be used as a measurement of orbital size . moreover , @xcite show how @xmath8 can sometimes be derived from observations with non - imaging instruments .    among the first fruits of work on the large smc sample of be / x - ray binaries ,",
    "@xcite show an excellent correlation between the distribution of be / x - ray binaries and star - forming regions in the smc , a promising result for the study of more distant galaxies .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite find that the spectral distribution of counterparts to smc be / x - ray binaries is very different from that of milky way systems , seriously challenging many current models .",
