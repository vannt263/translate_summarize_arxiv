    "<S> although finite temperature leads to small shifts and broadening of the excitation spectrum , the most relevant contribution to the spectral shape stems from the broadening of the dynamical structure factor with increasing interactions . </S>",

    "<S> further , a reduced @xmath43 analysis of our data with the computed spectra serves as a thermometry tool in the tubes and points to gas temperatures in the range of 5 to 10 nk . </S>",
    "<S> a moderate increase in temperature is seen for increasing values of @xmath26 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> so far , we have characterized the excitations in the gas by measuring @xmath44 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig4](a)-(c ) we plot the atomic line density after time - of - flight , integrated transversally to the direction of the tubes , which reflects the in - trap momentum distribution of the atomic ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements are taken at three different values of @xmath26 , ranging from the weakly to the strongly interacting regime , and at bragg excitation frequencies @xmath6 slightly below ( left column ) , just at ( central column ) , and slightly above ( right column ) the peak of the resonance .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we recognize a dramatic qualitative change in @xmath36 with increasing @xmath26 for all detunings presented . in the weakly interacting regime ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a ) ) , we observe a clear particle - like excitation located at @xmath45 as expected from the non - interacting limit . yet , with increasing interactions this feature smears out and evolves towards an overall broadening of @xmath36 , indicative of a strong collective response of the system to the bragg pulse . </S>",
    "<S> this observation demonstrates one of the key features of 1d systems : any excitation to the system is necessarily collective , and therefore leads to energy - broadened response functions , in contrast to sharp coherent single - particle modes . </S>",
    "<S> this broadening however only becomes clearly visible for strong enough interactions , where the hole - like modes become dynamically relevant .    in a further measurement , </S>",
    "<S> we attempt to quantify the response in momentum space in more detail . note that our previous measurement of @xmath44 captures both a broadening of the momentum distribution as well as an increase in the mean momentum @xmath46 . in order to separate both contributions spectroscopically </S>",
    "<S> , we plot the relative change @xmath42 of the width @xmath40 of the central part of @xmath36 around @xmath39 and @xmath46 as a function of @xmath6 for different values of @xmath26 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](d)-(f ) . </S>",
    "<S> the data indicate how collective excitations in the gas , expressed via energy deposition in @xmath40 rather than in @xmath46 , become dominant with increasing @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the two curves peak at different values for @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is confirmed by the momentum - space character of elementary excitations in the interacting 1d systems , which changes from a collective broadening for the lieb - ii mode to a particle - like feature for the lieb - i mode with increasing @xmath6 @xcite .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have measured the excitation spectrum of a strongly correlated 1d system for a wide range of interaction parameters . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with integrability - based calculations at finite temperature allows for a direct observation of the contribution of the collective lieb - ii mode to the dsf . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate the successful application of an integrable model to analyze dynamics of the 1d bose gas . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the collective nature of elementary excitations in 1d with increasing interaction strength has been demonstrated through an analysis of the momentum distribution . </S>",
    "<S> our results pose questions on the time evolution and potential equilibration of these collective excitations . </S>",
    "<S> this could be seen as an alternative quantum cradle setting @xcite in which , instead of colliding two highly energetic clouds of atoms , relatively low energy excitations propagate through the system , whose individual features can then be more easily studied .    </S>",
