    "thermal x - ray radiation is an important diagnostic tool for studying cosmic sources where high - energy processes are important .",
    "examples are the hot corona of the sun and of stars , solar and stellar flares , supernova remnants , cataclysmic variables , accretion disks in binary stars and around black holes ( galactic and extragalactic ) , the diffuse interstellar medium of our galaxy or external galaxies , the outer parts of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , the hot intracluster medium , the diffuse intercluster medium . in all these cases",
    "there is thermal x - ray emission or absorption .    in the present paper we focus upon the properties of the x - ray spectrum in the diffuse gas within and between galaxies , clusters and the large scale structures of the universe .",
    "as this gas has very low densities , the level populations in the atoms are not governed by saha - like equations , but instead most of the atoms will be in or near the ground state .",
    "this simplifies the problem considerably .",
    "furthermore , in these tenuous media we need to consider only gas with small or moderate optical depth ; the radiative transport is therefore simple .",
    "stellar coronae have similar physical conditions , but there the densities are higher so that in several cases the emergent spectrum has density - dependent features . due to the low densities in our sources , these density effects can be ignored in most cases ; however , for the lowest density gas photoionisation effects must be taken into account .    we show in this paper that it is possible to derive many different physical parameters from an x - ray spectrum : temperature , density , chemical abundances , plasma age , degree of ionisation , irradiating continuum , geometry etc .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "first , we give a brief overview of atomic structure ( sect .",
    "[ sect : atomic ] ) .",
    "we then discuss a few basic processes that play an important role for the thermal plasmas considered here ( sect .",
    "[ sect : basic ] ) .",
    "for the proper calculation of an x - ray spectrum , three different steps should be considered :    1 .   the determination of the ionisation balance ( sect .",
    "[ sect : balance ] ) , 2 .   the determination of the emitted spectrum ( sect .",
    "[ sect : emission ] ) , 3 .",
    "possible absorption of the photons on their way towards earth ( sect .",
    "[ sect : absorption ] ) .",
    "we then briefly discuss issues like the galactic foreground emission ( sect .",
    "[ sect : galem ] ) , plasma cooling ( sect .",
    "[ sect : cooling ] ) , the role of non - thermal electrons ( sect .",
    "[ sect : nonthermal ] ) , and conclude with a section on plasma modelling ( sect .",
    "[ sect : plasmamodelling ] ) .",
    "the electrons in an atom have orbits with discrete energy levels and quantum numbers .",
    "the principal quantum number @xmath0 corresponds to the energy @xmath1 of the orbit ( in the classical bohr model for the hydrogen atom the energy @xmath2 with @xmath3  ev the rydberg energy ) , and it takes discrete values @xmath41 , 2 , 3 , @xmath5 . an atomic shell",
    "consists of all electrons with the same value of @xmath0 .",
    "the second quantum number @xmath6 corresponds to the angular momentum of the electron , and takes discrete values @xmath7 .",
    "orbits with @xmath80 , 1 , 2 , 3 are designated as s , p , d , and f orbits .",
    "a subshell consists of all electrons with the same value of @xmath0 and @xmath6 ; they are usually designated as 1s , 2s , 2p , etc .",
    "the spin quantum number @xmath9 of an electron can take values @xmath10 , and the combined total angular momentum @xmath11 has a quantum number with values between @xmath12 ( for @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 .",
    "subshells are subdivided according to their @xmath11-value and are designated as @xmath15 .",
    "example : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 is designated as 2p@xmath19 .",
    "there is also another notation that is commonly used in x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "shells with @xmath41 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 are indicated with k , l , m , n , o , p , q. a further subdivision is made starting from low values of @xmath6 up to higher values of @xmath6 and from low values of @xmath11 up to higher values of @xmath11 :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the numbers represent the fraction of the atoms that are bound in dust grains .",
    "noble gases like ne and ar are chemically inert hence are generally not bound in dust grains , but other elements like ca exist predominantly in dust grains .",
    "dust has significantly different x - ray properties compared to gas or hot plasma .",
    "first , due to the chemical binding , energy levels are broadened significantly or even absent .",
    "for example , for oxygen in most bound forms ( like h@xmath20o ) the remaining two vacancies in the 2p shell are effectively filled by the two electrons from the other bound atom(s ) in the molecule .",
    "therefore , the strong 1s2p absorption line at 23.51    ( 527  ev ) is not allowed when the oxygen is bound in dust or molecules , because there is no vacancy in the 2p shell .",
    "transitions to higher shells such as the 3p shell are possible , however , but these are blurred significantly and often shifted due to the interactions in the molecule .",
    "each constituent has its own fine structure near the k - edge ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4u1820absorption]b ) .",
    "this fine structure offers therefore the opportunity to study the ( true ) chemical composition of the dust , but it should be said that the details of the edges in different important compounds are not always ( accurately ) known , and can differ depending on the state : for example water , crystalline and amorphous ice all have different characteristics . on the other hand , the large scale edge structure , in particular when observed at low spectral resolution , is not so much affected . for sufficiently high column densities of dust , self - shielding within the grains should be taken into account , and this reduces the average opacity per atom .",
    "finally , we mention here that dust also causes scattering of x - rays .",
    "this is in particular important for higher column densities .",
    "for example , for the crab nebula ( @xmath21  m@xmath22 ) , at an energy of 1 kev about 10  % of all photons are scattered in a halo , of which the widest tails have been observed out to a radius of at least half a degree ; the scattered fraction increases with increasing wavelength .",
    "the interstellar medium of our galaxy is a complex medium .",
    "while all phases of the ism can be seen in x - ray absorption towards bright x - ray sources ( see previous section ) , only the hot phase is seen in emission and contributes to the cosmic x - ray background .",
    "this cosmic x - ray background has different components .",
    "@xcite distinguish four different components as outlined below .",
    "first , there is an absorbed power - law like component , consisting mostly of unresolved extragalactic point sources . with high spatial resolution like for example available on chandra ,",
    "a large part of this component can be resolved into the individual point sources .",
    "the second component is the so - called local hot bubble , most likely a large , old supernova remnant embedding our solar system .",
    "the million degree gas of this diffuse medium is almost unabsorbed , as it is nearby and there is little intervening neutral gas . finally , there are the soft and hard diffuse components , consisting of absorbed , diffuse thermal emission which arises from the disk of our galaxy but may also contain contributions from a galactic halo and distant whim emission .",
    "[ fig : cxb ] shows a simulated spectrum of the total x - ray background .",
    "note however that the details of this spectrum may differ significantly for different parts of the sky .",
    "there are variations on large scales , from the galactic plane to the poles .",
    "there are also smaller scale variations .",
    "for instance , there are large loops corresponding to old supernova remnants or ( super)bubbles , and large molecular cloud complexes obscuring the more distant background components .",
    "the cooling of a plasma by thermal radiation is usually expressed by the cooling function @xmath23 .",
    "this is essentially the bolometric power @xmath24 emitted as thermal radiation by the plasma , normalised by the emission measure @xmath25 .",
    "accordingly , the characteristic cooling time , defined as the thermal energy of the plasma divided by the emitted power , @xmath26 .    cooling is important for the evolution of several plasmas such as the cool cores of clusters but also for the global evolution of the whim .",
    "a set of useful cooling curves are given by @xcite .",
    "an example is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : coolingcurve ] .",
    "these are valid under cie conditions . when photoionisation is important , modifications are needed . here",
    "we have normalised @xmath27 to the emission measure of the plasma , but note that sometimes other scalings are being used ( for example expressions containing the ion density @xmath28 or @xmath29 ) .",
    "note that the solar abundances used in fig .",
    "[ fig : coolingcurve ] are the older values of @xcite which differ significantly from more recent estimates , for example @xcite , in particular for important coolants such as iron ( new values 26  % lower ) and oxygen ( new values 32  % lower ) .",
    "the big hump at low temperatures is produced mainly by line radiation , while the high temperature @xmath30 tail above @xmath31  k is mainly produced by bremsstrahlung .",
    "finally , a more recent set of cooling curves , suited in particular for lower temperatures and primordial gas , was published by @xcite .",
    "in most cases , astrophysical plasmas are modelled using maxwellian velocity distributions , even under nei or pie conditions . often this is justified , but there are situations where deviations from a maxwellian distribution occur .",
    "examples are accelerated electrons penetrating cooler regions , as may occur in or near shocks or flares .",
    "we refrain here from a full discussion , but only mention here that spectral codes such as spex ( sect .",
    "[ sect : codes ] ) allow the calculation of the ionisation balance and the emanating spectrum under such circumstances , provided the true electron distribution can be approximated by the sum of non - relativistic maxwellians .",
    "when there are strong relativistic electron contributions , this approach can not be used anymore as here relativistic corrections to the cross sections are needed , which are usually not taken into account in most plasma codes .",
    "1 .   chianti , ( named after the wine region near firenze , @xcite ) evolved from early work by @xcite ; originally , it focussed on the calculation of solar spectra and hence euv lines are well represented in this code .",
    "2 .   apec ( astrophysical plasma emission code , @xcite evolved from the original @xcite code ; originally , the main goal was to calculate the emissivity and cooling curve properly .",
    "this model is available in the popular fitting package xspec , @xcite .",
    "3 .   mekal ( after mewe , kaastra & liedahl ; see @xcite ) evolved from early work by mewe and collaborators starting from 1970 onwards .",
    "the mekal model is also incorporated in xspec .",
    "the mekal model is now part of the spex package , @xcite .",
    "spex is a spectral fitting package developed at sron utrecht based on the original cie models of mewe and collaborators .",
    "it has grown significantly and also contains nei and a few simple pie models ; more models are under development .",
    "the package offers the opportunity to plot or tabulate also various physical parameters of interest of the model , apart from the spectrum , and the atomic physics used in the mekal model has been significantly updated in the spex version as compared to the older version available in xspec .",
    "a majority of all plots shown in this paper were produced using spex .      1",
    ".   xstar evolved from the original work of @xcite , focussing upon the x - ray band .",
    "it is relatively straightforward to use and there are options to use it with xspec .",
    "cloudy @xcite evolved from work by ferland and collaborators that originally was meant to model optical emission line regions .",
    "it gradually evolved to the x - ray band .",
    "it is somewhat more complicated to use , but has more options than xstar .      in order to calculate x - ray spectra for collisional plasmas",
    ", there is a set of parameters that determine the spectral shape and flux .",
    "the two most important parameters are the electron temperature @xmath32 and emission measure @xmath33 of the gas .",
    "the emission measure is sometimes not well or even incorrectly defined .",
    "we follow here the definition used in spex , namely @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the electron and hydrogen density ( whether ionised or not ) .",
    "sometimes people use `` @xmath37 '' in this expression , but it is not always obvious whether ion density , baryon density , electron density , total particle density or something else is meant .",
    "the next important parameters are the abundances of the elements ; these do not only determine the line emission spectrum , but also affect the continuum emission ( sect .",
    "[ sect : contem ] ) . note that the abundances also affect the precise values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 . for a fully ionised plasma with proto - solar abundances",
    "@xcite these ratios are 1.201 and 1.097 , respectively ( for the older @xcite abundances these ratios are 1.209 and 1.099 ) .",
    "when high spectral resolution observations are available , other parameters are important , like the ion temperature and turbulent velocity .",
    "these parameters determine the width of the spectral lines ( see sect .  [",
    "sect : linemis ] and sect .",
    "[ sect : linabs ] ) . note that in non - equilibrium plasmas , the electron and ion temperatures are not necessarily the same . in an extreme case ,",
    "the supernova remnant sn  1006 , @xcite measured an oxygen ion temperature that is 350 times larger than the electron temperature of 1.5  kev .",
    "spex has also options to approximate the spectra when there are non - maxwellian tails to the electron distribution ( sect .",
    "[ sect : nonthermal ] ) .",
    "these tails may be produced by non - thermal acceleration mechanisms ( @xcite - chapter 9 , this volume ) .",
    "in general , for the low densities encountered in the diffuse ism of galaxies , in clusters and in the whim , the absolute electron density is not important ( except for the overall spectral normalisation through the emission measure @xmath33 ) . only in the higher density regions of for example",
    "stars x - ray line ratios are affected by density effects , but this is outside the scope of the present paper .    however",
    ", if the density becomes extremely low , such as in the lowest density parts of the whim , the gas density matters , as in such situations photoionisation by the diffuse radiation field of galaxies or the cosmic background becomes important .",
    "but even in such cases , it is not the spectral shape but the ionisation ( im)balance that is affected most . in those cases essentially the ratio of incoming radiation flux to gas density determines the photoionisation equilibrium .",
    "several astrophysical sources can not be characterised by a single temperature",
    ". there may be various reasons for this .",
    "it may be that the source has regions with different temperatures that can not be spatially resolved due to the large distance to the source , the low angular resolution of the x - ray instrument , or superposition of spectra along the line of sight .",
    "examples of these three conditions are stellar coronae ( almost point sources as seen from earth ) , integrated cluster of galaxies spectra , or spectra along the line of sight through the cooling core of a cluster , respectively . but also in other less obvious cases multi - temperature structure can be present .",
    "for example @xcite showed using deprojected spectra that at each position in several cool core clusters there is an intrinsic temperature distribution .",
    "this may be due to unresolved smaller regions in pressure equilibrium with different densities and hence different temperatures .",
    "the most simple solution is to add as many temperature components as are needed to describe the observed spectrum , but there are potential dangers to this .",
    "the main reason is temperature sensitivity .",
    "most spectral temperature indicators ( line fluxes , bremsstrahlung exponential cut - off ) change significantly when the temperature is changed by a factor of two .",
    "however , for smaller temperature changes , the corresponding spectral changes are also minor .",
    "for example , a source with two components of equal emission measure @xmath33 and @xmath41=0.99 and 1.01  kev , respectively , is almost indistinguishable from a source with the emission measure @xmath42 and temperature 1.00  kev .",
    "obviously , the most general case is a continuous differential emission measure distribution ( dem ) @xmath43 . typically , in each logarithmic temperature range with a width of a factor of two",
    ", one can redistribute the differential emission measure @xmath44 in such a way that the total emission measure as integrated over that interval as well as the emission - measure weighted temperature remain constant .",
    "the resulting spectra are almost indistinguishable .",
    "this point is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dem ] .",
    "there are several methods to reconstruct @xmath44 .",
    "we refer here to @xcite for more details .",
    "all these methods have been implemented in spex .",
    "they have been applied to stellar coronae or solar spectra , but recently also to clusters of galaxies .",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "in the last case , an analytical power - law approximation @xmath45 has been used .",
    "also for photo - ionised plasmas a similar technique can be applied .",
    "instead of the temperature @xmath46 , one uses the ionisation parameter @xmath47 ( xstar users ) or @xmath48 ( cloudy users ) . in some cases ( like seyfert 2 galaxies with emission spectra ) one recovers @xmath49 from the observed emission spectra ; in other cases ( like seyfert 1 galaxies with absorption spectra ) , a continuum model is applied to the observed spectrum , and @xmath49 is recovered from the absorption features in the spectrum .",
    "most of what has been said before on @xmath44 also applies to this case , i.e. the resolution in @xmath47 and the various methods to reconstruct the continuous distribution @xmath49 .",
