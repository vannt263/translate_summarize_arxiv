    "in the last ten years the interest around the control and manipulation of quantum systems has grown very fast . the possibility to encode and process information has lead to innovative proposals .",
    "the major results have been achieved in quantum information processing ( qip ) , including both theoretical and experimental ones .",
    "quantum cryptography @xcite and information transfer protocols @xcite have enhanced our understanding of information processing and this in the near future will presumably lead to a significant technical advancement .",
    "quantum computation ( qc ) is still in a initial stage : even if the quantum computers seem to be able to solve quickly some problems which are intractable with classical computers @xcite , more quantum algorithms are required to extend its applicability .",
    "unfortunately , the quantum system are very delicate and they are subject to two different kinds of errors . on one hand , there is the loss of information due to decoherence the unavoidable interaction of quantum systems with their environments .",
    "this problem has been extensively studied over the past few years and proposals to overcome it have been put forward ( and a few have been experimentally tested ) .",
    "these proposals include error avoiding @xcite , error correcting strategies @xcite and decoupling techniques @xcite .",
    "the other source of errors is the imprecise control of the parameters which perform the quantum operation ( e.g. the laser or the magnetic field ) .",
    "how to handle such errors is an open problem , though some progress has been made in the framework of the so called geometrical quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to approach the second problem in very simple and idealized situations .    a simple way to model the parameter noise is to consider a quantum system subject to a stochastic fluctuating field with zero mean .",
    "such a model has been recently considered in order to study the effect of the noise on holonomic quantum gates : in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that there is a cancellation effect for a fast fluctuating stochastic field and shown that such a cancellation is due to the geometrical dependence of the holonomic operator .",
    "recently , the general validity of such cancellation effect has been clarified : in ref .",
    "@xcite is has be shown that for sufficient fast fluctuating stochastic field with zero mean the effects of the noise are wiped out .    in this paper",
    "we shall study simple quantum systems subjected to stochastic noise and discuss some applications . in section [ sec:2ls ]",

    "fidelity_. by elementary perturbation theory , we show that the effects of the noise are wiped out . in section [ sec : adiabatic ] we discuss how noise cancellation could be relevant for _ adiabatic population transfer _ experiments in atoms optics ( in this case , the cancellation effect avoids the break of the adiabatic approximation , and allows for desired transformation , even in presence of fast fluctuating noise ) .    for sake of simplicity ,",
    "all the simulations and analytical calculation are done with gaussian noise distributions but presumably analogous results can be achieved with a generic stochastic noise with zero mean @xcite .",

    "let @xmath10 be some `` final '' time at which we wish to consider the system , and let @xmath11 ; @xmath8 can be regarded the correlation time of the noise .",

    "then ( [ cron ] ) is trivially computed ( due to the commutativity of the @xmath5 ) , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the evolution generated by @xmath21 , and @xmath22    a standard performance estimator is the _ fidelity _ @xcite , which , in our case , is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the `` ideal '' final state evolved according to @xmath21 ( that is , when the noise is turned off ) and @xmath25 is actual final state ( that is , when the noise is turned on ) .",
    "the two final states are generated , of course , by the _ same _ ( generic ) initial state @xmath26 . from ( [ ut ] ) and ( [ dut ] )",
    "one easily obtains @xmath27 where @xmath28     the _ square fidelity _ from noisy process described by ( [ eq : diagonal_noise ] ) .",
    "the solid line is the theoretical mean square fidelity , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fidelity ] ) , for @xmath29 ( in arbitrary units ) and @xmath30.,height=188 ]    since the random variables @xmath16 in ( [ eq : chi ] ) are taken to be independent and identically distributed according to a gaussian with zero mean and variance @xmath31 , the probability distribution of @xmath32 is @xmath33 by averaging ( [ eq : fidelity_general ] ) with respect to ( [ eq : mean_over_realization ] ) , we arrive at the mean square fidelity : @xmath34    as it can be easily seen , for @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( while keeping @xmath37 of order 1 ) , the mean square fidelity @xmath38 approaches @xmath39 ( since @xmath40 ) , independently of the initial state .",
    "this corresponds to a short correlation time of the noise , that is , to a fast random fluctuating field .",
    "now we d like to provide some perspective on such limit behavior .",
    "of course , the limit @xmath41 is only an idealization for @xmath8 small but finite .",
    "the above results are obtained for _ constant _ @xmath42 , but the heisenberg uncertainty relation imposes strong constraint on the energy fluctuation happening in such a short time interval , @xmath43 . note that for @xmath44 eq .",
    "( [ eq : mean_over_realization ] ) and ( [ eq : fidelity ] ) describe a system interacting with a white noise environment that is the standard way to model the decoherence effect .",
    "so , for very small @xmath8 the variance @xmath42 should not be any more considered constant and our approximation of constant variance breaks down .",
    "however , rather than microscopic ( environmental ) noise , we are interested in modeling the macroscopic ( parametric ) noise due to imprecision in the control field , and for such our approximation should apply . in this case",
    "it is interesting to ask whether the condition of small @xmath8 could be physically relevant . in general , in a quantum evolution the final time @xmath10 is fixed ; the correlation time @xmath8 can be hardly controlled ( i.e. , stabilizing the control field ) and we are not in the condition to have a cancellation effect . in section [ sec : experiment ] we present an experimental proposal to test the presence of this effect ; the experiment realizability lies in the control of the correlation time @xmath8 of the _ simulated _ noise .",
    "moreover , there are situations in which this effect can be experimentally relevant : when we have a further degree of freedom and can change the evolution time @xmath10 . in these cases , fixed @xmath8 with the above properties , we can prolong @xmath10 in order to have @xmath45 ( that is @xmath46 ) and exploit the cancellation effect .",
    "we give an example of such situation in a adiabatic evolution in section [ sec : adiabatic ] .",
    "we observe that another interesting feature of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fidelity ] ) is that the cancellation of the noise does not depend on the strength @xmath47 : it is always possible to find a suitable @xmath48 in order to obtain cancellation of the noise|invert equation ( [ eq : fidelity ] ) and express @xmath48 in terms of @xmath49 for given @xmath50 and evolution time @xmath10 .",
    "we recall that dependence of the fidelity on a specific choice of the initial state is usually eliminated by averaging @xmath51 over all the possible initial states with respect to the uniform distribution on the unit sphere in the hilbert space of the system @xcite in our case the ( projective ) sphere @xmath40 .",
    "performing this operation yields to @xmath52     the decoherence effect during the evolution for two different value of @xmath53 .",
    "theoretical curves ( dashed line ) and those obtained by numerical simulations ( solid line ) are showed .",
    "for the theoretical curve ( eq .",
    "[ eq : deco_expression ] ) the decoherence time is @xmath54 .",
    ", height=188 ]    the simple model we have been considering here is often used as a toy model for phenomenological decoherence @xcite . the relationship between noise cancellation and decoherence",
    "is easily seen by considering the time evolution at the discrete times @xmath55 , @xmath56 . by proceeding as before , the average square fidelity at time @xmath55 results @xmath57 with which it is quite natural to associate a ` decoherence time ' @xmath58 ( see figure [ fig : deco_time ] @xcite ) .      in ref .",
    "@xcite kielpinski _",
    "_ used the same idea to simulate the decoherence effect due to interaction of the quantum system with the environment degree of freedom .",
    "the authors used trapped ions and study the coherence of superposition of quantum state subject to simulated noise .",
    "the logical states were the hyperfine states of a trapped beryllium ion @xmath59 and @xmath60 sublevels of the ground state @xmath61s@xmath62 .",
    "the environment noise was simulated shining the ions with a off - resonant laser with random varying amplitude for the electromagnetic field @xmath63 and random intensity ( proportional to @xmath64 ) .",
    "the laser electromagnetic field produce a ac stark effect on the ions and let one state to acquire a random phase respect to the other .",
    "this effect is _ quadratic _ ( _ quadratic stark effect _ ) in the electromagnetic field @xmath63 .",
    "in fact , the two hyperfine states have the same angular momentum ( they have both @xmath65 ) and the difference is in the spin part of the wave function .",
    "the splitting of the energy level is _ linear _ ( _ linear stark effect _ ) for state with different angular momentum since only these states have non - vanishing matrix element @xmath66 ( with @xmath67 ) .",
    "then in the above example we have corrections to the energy level only quadratic and not linear in @xmath63 .",
    "because of the quadratic energy shift , we have a random phase difference proportional to @xmath64 for every @xmath8 interval .",
    "even if this effect is sufficient to produce decoherence effect ( as found by the authors ) , we can not presumably see the cancellation effect discussed above in a transparent way since our new stochastic variable @xmath68 has no zero mean .",
    "a small modification of this experiment should allow us to see sharply this cancellation effect .",
    "to have an evolution described by hamiltonian ( [ eq : diagonal_noise ] ) it is sufficient to use states with different angular momentum in order to produce a _ linear stark effect_. at every time interval @xmath8 the perturbation of the laser produce a shift of the energy levels proportional to the random intensity of the laser @xmath63 ; this produces an evolution where the phase difference between the states is given by a known dynamical part plus a random phase @xmath69 ( where @xmath70 is a proportional constant ) . in this case",
    ", the new stochastic variable @xmath71 has still zero mean and we expect to obtain results shown in the previous section : fixed the evolution time @xmath10 we should see an increase of @xmath72 as the correlation time decreases ( see figure [ fig:2ls_diagonal ] ) .",
    "moreover , if the environment decoherence does not depend on the simulated noise , we should be able to see effect analogous to the ones in figure [ fig : deco_time ] .",
    "in particular , subtracted the effect of the environment , the decoherence time should increase as @xmath73 .",

    "the trends of the two curves are correlated , which is suggesting that the main source of error in the operation is the population of excited state due to loss of the adiabatic approximation . as expected ,",
    "because of the cancellation effect , for great @xmath176 the _ fidelity _ approaches @xmath39 even in presence of strong noise and the @xmath134 state is not populated .",
