    "in nature , there are no true equilibrium phenomena , since all of these require infinite times and infinite thermal reservoirs or perfect insulations . nevertheless , for a large class of systems , it is possible to set up conditions under which predictions from _ equilibrium _ statistical mechanics provide excellent approximations , as many of the inventions of the industrial revolution can attest to .",
    "by contrast , non - equilibrium phenomena are not only ubiquitous , but often elude the powers of the boltzmann - gibbs framework .",
    "unfortunately , to date , the theoretical development of _ non - equilibrium _ statistical mechanics is at a stage comparable to that of its equilibrium counterpart in the days before maxwell and boltzmann . using the intuition developed by studying equilibrium statistical mechanics , we are often `` surprised '' by the behavior displayed by systems far from equilibrium , even if they appear to be in time - independent states . for example",
    ", the well honed arguments , based on the competition between energy and entropy , frequently fail dramatically . in these lectures",
    ", we will present some explorations into the intriguing realm of _ non - equilibrium steady states _",
    ", focusing only on a small class , namely , driven diffusive systems .    motivated by both the theoretical interest in non - equilibrium steady states and the physics of fast ionic conductors @xcite , katz , lebowitz and spohn @xcite introduced a deceptively minor modification to a well - known system in equilibrium statistical mechanics : the ising @xcite model with nearest - neighbor interactions . in lattice gas language @xcite ,",
    "the time evolution of this model can be specified by particles hopping to nearest vacant sites , with rates which simulate coupling to a thermal bath as well as an external field , such as gravity .",
    "if `` brick wall '' boundary conditions are imposed in the direction associated with gravity ( particles reflected at the boundary , comparable to a floor or a ceiling ) , and if the rates obey detailed balance , then this system will eventually settle into an _ equilibrium _ state , similar to that of gas molecules in a typical room on earth .",
    "although there is a local bias in the hopping rates ( due to gravity ) , thermal equilibrium is established by an inhomogeneous particle density , at all @xmath0 . however ,",
    "if _ periodic _ boundary conditions are imposed , then translational invariance is completely restored so that , in the final steady state , the particle density is _ homogeneous _",
    ", for all @xmath1 above some finite critical @xmath2 , while a current will be present . clearly ,",
    "for gravity , such boundary conditions can be imposed only in art , as by m.c .",
    "escher @xcite . in physics",
    ", it is possible to establish such a situation with an _ electric _ field , e.g. , by placing the @xmath3 lattice on the surface of a cylinder and applying a linearly increasing magnetic field down the cylinder xis .",
    "if the particles are charged , they will experience a local bias everywhere on the cylinder and a current will persist in the steady state . echoing the physics of fast ionic conductors , we will therefore use the term `` electric '' field to describe the external drive and imagine our particles to be `` charged '' , in their response to this drive .",
    "this is the prototype of a `` driven diffusive system . ''",
    "now , such a system constantly gains ( loses ) energy from ( to ) the external field ( thermal bath ) , so that the time independent state is by no means an equilibrium state ,  la boltzmann - gibbs .",
    "instead , it is a _ non - equilibrium steady state _",
    ", with an unknown distribution in general . as discovered in the last decade , modifying the ising model to include a simple local bias leads to a large variety of far - from - simple behavior .",
    "the scope of these lectures necessarily limits us to only a bird s eye view . since",
    "a more extensive review has been published recently @xcite , we will restrict these notes to a brief `` introduction '' to this subject . instead , we choose to include some developments since that review .    for completeness ,",
    "we summarize , in section ii , the lattice model introduced by kls and the langevin equation believed to capture its essence in the long - time large - distance regime . the next section ( iii ) is devoted to some of the surprising behavior displayed by this system , at temperatures far above , near , and well below @xmath2 .",
    "a collection of recent developments is presented in section iv . in the final section ( v ) , we conclude with a brief summary .",
    "on a square lattice , with @xmath4 sites and toroidal boundary conditions , a particle or a hole may occupy each site .",
    "a configuration is specified by the occupation numbers @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a site label and @xmath7 is either 1 or 0 .",
    "occasionally , we also use spin language , defining @xmath8 . to access the critical point ,",
    "half - filled lattices are generally used in monte carlo simulations : @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "the particles are endowed with nearest - neighbor attraction ( ferromagnetic , in spin language ) , modeled in the usual way through the hamiltonian : @xmath11 , with @xmath12 .",
    "the external drive , with strength @xmath13 and pointing in the @xmath14 direction , will bias in favor of particles hopping `` downwards '' . to simulate coupling to a thermal bath at temperature @xmath1 ,",
    "the metropolis algorithm is typically used , i.e. , the contents of a randomly chosen , nearest - neighbor , particle - hole pair are exchanged , with a probability @xmath15 $ ] . here , @xmath16 is the change in @xmath17 after the exchange and @xmath18 , for a particle attempting to hop ( against , orthogonal to , along ) the drive . note that these dynamic rules conserve particle number . for @xmath19",
    ", this system will eventually settle into an equilibrium state which is precisely the static ising model @xcite . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "it is known to undergo a second order phase transition at the onsager critical temperature @xmath20 . when driven ( @xmath21 )",
    ", this system displays the same qualitative properties , i.e. , there is a disordered phase for large @xmath1 , followed by a second order transition into a phase - segregated state for low @xmath1 .",
    "however , with more scrutiny , this superficial similarity gives way to puzzling surprises .",
    "in particular , @xmath22 appears to be monotonically _ increasing _ with @xmath23 , saturating at about @xmath24 @xcite for @xmath25 .",
    "why should @xmath26 be surprising ? consider the following `` argument '' .",
    "for very large @xmath23 , hopping along @xmath27 becomes like a random walk , in that @xmath16 is irrelevant for the rates .",
    "therefore , hops along @xmath27 might as well be coupled to a thermal bath at _ infinite _ @xmath1 ( apart from the bias ) .",
    "indeed , recall that our system gains energy from @xmath23 and loses it to the bath , so that any drive may be thought of as a coupling to a second reservoir with higher temperature .",
    "then , it seems reasonable that @xmath1 must be _ lowered _ to achieve ordering , since this extra reservoir pumps in a higher level of noise , helping to _ disorder _ the system ! to date , there is neither a convincing argument nor a computation which predicts the correct _ sign _ of @xmath28 , let alone the magnitude . in the next section , we will briefly review other puzzling discoveries , only a few of which are understood .    to understand collective behavior in the long - time and large - scale limit",
    ", we often rely on continuum descriptions , which are hopefully universal to some extent .",
    "successful examples include hydrodynamics and landau - ginzburg theories .",
    "certainly , the @xmath29 theory , enhanced by renormalization group techniques , offers excellent predictions for both the statics and the dynamics near equilibrium of the ising model .",
    "following these lines , we formulate a continuum theory for the kls model , in arbitrary dimension @xmath30 . in principle , such a description can be obtained by coarse - graining the microscopic dynamics @xcite but we will pursue a more phenomenological approach here . seeking a theory in the long - time , large wavelength limit , we first identify the slow variables of the theory . these are typically    * ordering fields which experience critical slowing down near @xmath2 , and * any conserved densities .",
    "the kls model is particularly simple since it involves a single ordering field , namely the local `` magnetization '' or excess particle density , @xmath31 , which is also the only conserved quantity . here",
    ", @xmath32 stands for @xmath33 .",
    "the last entry denotes the one - dimensional `` parallel '' subspace selected by @xmath23 .",
    "thus , we begin with a continuity equation , @xmath34 , and postulate an appropriate form for the current @xmath35 . in the absence of @xmath23 , it simply takes its model b @xcite form , @xmath36 , with the landau - ginzburg hamiltonian @xmath37 . as usual , @xmath38 and @xmath39 . while the first contribution to @xmath35 is a deterministic term , reflecting local chemical potential gradients , the second term , @xmath40 , models the thermal noise .",
    "the noise is gaussian distributed , with zero mean and positive second moment proportional to the unit matrix , i.e. , @xmath41 , @xmath42 . in the presence of @xmath23",
    ", we should expect at least two modifications to @xmath43 , namely first , an additional contribution @xmath44 modeling the nonvanishing mass transport through the system and second , the generation of anisotropies , since @xmath23 singles out a specific direction . by virtue of the excluded volume constraint , the `` ohmic '' current @xmath44 vanishes at densities @xmath45 and @xmath46 , corresponding to @xmath47 .",
    "writing @xmath48 for the coarse - grained counterpart of @xmath23 , pointing along unit vector @xmath49 , the simplest form is therefore @xmath50{\\bf \\hat{y}}$ ] , where the @xmath51 corrections will turn out to be irrelevant for universal properties .",
    "next , we consider possible anisotropies . clearly , all @xmath52 operators should be split into components parallel ( @xmath53 ) and transverse ( @xmath54 ) to @xmath23 , accompanied by different coefficients . for example , the anisotropic version of the model b term @xmath55 will read @xmath56 @xmath57 , with two different `` diffusion '' coefficients for the parallel and transverse subspaces .",
    "should we expect both of these to vanish as @xmath1 approaches @xmath58 ? or just one of them - but which one ?",
    "recalling that the lowering of @xmath59 , in the equilibrium system , is a consequence of the presence of interparticle interactions , we argue that @xmath23 , stirring parallel jumps much more effectively than transverse ones , should _ counteract _ this effect in the parallel direction , having less of an impact in the transverse subspace .",
    "thus , we anticipate that generically @xmath60 , so that criticality , in particular , is marked by @xmath61 vanishing at positive @xmath62 .",
    "this is borne out by the structure of typical ordered configurations , namely , single strips aligned with @xmath23 , indicating that `` antidiffusion '' , i.e. , @xmath63 , dominates in the transverse directions below @xmath2 .",
    "finally , the drive also induces anisotropies in the noise terms so that the second moment of their distribution should be taken as @xmath64 .",
    "since the transverse subspace is still fully isotropic , we define @xmath65 .",
    "generically , however , we should expect @xmath66 @xmath67 .",
    "summarizing , we write down the full langevin equation : @xmath68 with noise correlations @xmath69    this equation forms the basis for the analytic study of the kls model .",
    "fortunately , we need not be concerned about the detailed dependence of its coefficients on the microscopic @xmath1 , @xmath70 , and @xmath23 .",
    "while they are in principle calculable within an explicit coarse - graining scheme , the properties that we already outlined above suffice for our purposes . moreover , it turns out that we can simplify the most general form , ( [ lang ] ) , depending on the temperature regime considered .",
    "we will return to this discussion in sections 3.1 and 3.3 below .    to conclude this section ,",
    "let us take a glance at the structure of ( [ lang ] ) .",
    "its basic form is @xmath71 , with noise correlations @xmath72 and @xmath73 just a positive constant . for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to a scalar order parameter @xmath74 and noise `` matrices '' @xmath75 which do not depend on @xmath74 ( more general cases are discussed in , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath76 is a functional of @xmath74 and its derivatives . given this basic form , a steady - state solution @xmath77 $ ] for the configurational probability is easily found @xcite _ provided _ @xmath78 is `` hamiltonian '' , i.e. , if it can be written as @xmath75 acting on a total functional derivative : @xmath79 . in this case",
    ", @xmath80 is simply proportional to @xmath81 , irrespective of the choice of @xmath75 .",
    "we will refer to such a dynamics , in an operational sense @xcite , as `` satisfying the fluctuation - dissipation theorem '' ( fdt ) @xcite .",
    "model b falls into this category , with @xmath82 .",
    "in contrast , for our driven system , @xmath83 is just the expression in the @xmath84 brackets of ( [ lang ] ) and @xmath85 , so that @xmath86 .",
    "thus , this @xmath83 is clearly _ not _ hamiltonian ! in this fashion ,",
    "our continuum theory reflects the fact that we are dealing with a generic non - equilibrium steady state .",
    "for completeness , we should point out that certain microscopically non - hamiltonian dynamics may _ become _ hamiltonian if viewed on sufficiently large length scales .",
    "the discussion of these subtleties @xcite , while intriguing , is beyond the scope of these lectures .",
    "for the @xmath3 ising model in equilibrium , thermodynamic quantities are typically analytic , except at a single point , i.e. , @xmath2 . in particular , being a model with only short - range interactions , correlation functions are short - ranged far above @xmath2 , decaying exponentially with distance and controlled by a finite correlation length . far below criticality ,",
    "a half filled system in a square geometry will display two strips of equal width , as a result of the co - existence of a particle rich ( dense ) phase with hole - rich one .",
    "correlations of the fluctuations within each phase are also short - ranged .",
    "more interestingly , the interfaces between the phases do represent soft degrees of freedom , being the goldstone mode of a broken translational invariance @xcite .",
    "one consequence is a divergent structure factor ( fourier transform of the two - point correlation , of deviations from being straight ) .",
    "although this behavior is singular , it is well understood and can be related to that of a simple random walk @xcite . only at criticality does the system possess non - trivial singular properties , the _ nature _ of which became transparent only in the 70s@xcite despite onsager s tour - de - force in 1944@xcite .    when driven into _ non - equilibrium steady states _ , this picture changes dramatically .",
    "in particular , non - trivial singular behavior appears at all @xmath1 . while the transition itself remains second order , its properties fall into a non - ising class . here",
    ", we will present some of these surprising features briefly , referring the reader to @xcite for more details .      focusing on the behavior far above criticality ,",
    "let us study the two - point correlation @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) and its transform , the structure factor , @xmath90 .",
    "we first point out that the drive clearly induces an asymmetry between @xmath91 and @xmath27 , i.e. , anisotropy beyond that due to the lattice .",
    "thus , we should not be surprised if the familiar ornstein zernike form of @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) were to become elliptical rather than circular , e.g. , similar to fig.1a .",
    "however , simulations @xcite showed that there is a _",
    "singularity in @xmath92 at the origin , as in fig.1b . to be more precise",
    ", we may define @xmath94 and measure the discontinuity by @xmath95 . though @xmath96 does approach unity for @xmath97 ,",
    "it is about 4 , for large @xmath23 , even at twice the critical temperature .",
    "further , it diverges as @xmath98 ! we should remind the reader that , for the equilibrium case , @xmath92 may diverge at criticality , but @xmath96 is unity always .",
    "strange as it may seem , this behavior can be understood within the context of the continuum approach , eqn .",
    "( [ lang ] ) . for @xmath99 , _ both _",
    "@xmath100 _ and _ @xmath61 are positive .",
    "thus , the local magnetization @xmath31 fluctuates around a stable minimum at zero , and neither the fourth - order derivatives nor the nonlinearities are necessary for stability . as a consequence , the behavior of the system in the disordered phase can be described by a much simpler , _ linear _ langevin equation , namely , @xmath101 with the help of a fourier transform , we can easily find @xmath102 for any realization of @xmath40 , and then compute averages over the gaussian distributed @xmath40 , with its second moment given by ( [ lang ] ) .",
    "this forms the starting point for the discussion of the disordered phase , quantified by , e.g. , equal - time structure factors or three - point functions @xcite .    here",
    ", we focus on the former , @xmath103 , which can be easily computed : @xmath104 so that @xmath105 . in order for this @xmath92 to reduce to the equilibrium ornstein - zernike form",
    ", the fdt has to be invoked , which constrains @xmath96 to unity . for the driven case ,",
    "@xmath96 is no longer constrained , so that a discontinuity develops .",
    "one consequence of such a singularity in @xmath92 is that @xmath106 becomes _ long - ranged _ , decaying as @xmath107 at large @xmath108 .",
    "the amplitude , in addition to being @xmath109 , has a dipolar angular dependence , so that an appropriate angular average of @xmath106 is again short - ranged @xcite .    to end this discussion ,",
    "let us follow g. grinstein s argument @xcite that such long - ranged power law decays _ should be expected_. starting with the dynamic two - point correlation @xmath110 , we know that the conservation law leads to the autocorrelation : @xmath111 .",
    "in addition , being a diffusive system , we should expect @xmath112 , at least far from criticality .",
    "using _ naive _ scaling , we would write @xmath113 ! in other words , the generic behavior of @xmath106 in a diffusive system is @xmath114 decay , _ not exponential_. in this case , the equilibrium system is the non - generic one , in which the amplitude of this generic term is forced to vanish , by fdt .",
    "our familiarity with equilibrium systems is so strong that , on first sight , power law decays far above @xmath2 appear quite surprising .",
    "finally , note that a scaling argument of this kind can not produce the angular dependence , a crucial feature of the generic singularities of driven diffusive systems .",
    "next , we turn to systems far below @xmath2 . due to the conservation law",
    ", they typically display phase co - existence , so that the dominant fluctuations and slow modes are those associated with the interface between the phases .",
    "again , for the @xmath3 ising model in equilibrium , there is a wealth of information on the properties of the interface @xcite . in particular , being a _",
    "one_-dimensional object , the interface exhibits behavior identical to a simple random walk @xcite at the large scales , such as widths diverging as @xmath115 . in our case , if we study an interface aligned along the @xmath27 axis , then , to a good approximation , we may specify the configuration by its position along @xmath91 by the `` height '' function @xmath116 .",
    "known as capillary waves @xcite , these fluctuations have a venerable history .",
    "since the interface is a manifestation of broken translational invariance , @xmath116 are the soft goldstone modes @xcite , so that the associated structure factor @xmath117 diverges as @xmath118 .",
    "of course , this property is just the fourier version of the @xmath115 divergence : @xmath119 .",
    "interfaces with divergent widths are also known as `` rough '' ; only for @xmath120 may interfaces in crystalline ising - like models display transitions from rough to smooth phases .",
    "when _ driven _ , however , the interface width appears to approach a _",
    "finite width _ at large distances .",
    "in particular , for @xmath121 , using lattices up to @xmath122 and plotting the widths vs. @xmath123 with various values of @xmath124 , we found that the curves did not straighten out with @xmath125 as low as 0.05 @xcite . as a phenomenon ,",
    "roughness suppression is not novel , gravity being the most common example .",
    "however , the drive here is _",
    "parallel _ to the interface , reminiscent of wind driving across a water surface , which has a _ destabilizing _ effect by contrast .",
    "subsequently , a more detailed simulation study @xcite of the interface with @xmath126 showed that @xmath127 for large @xmath128 , crossing over to @xmath129 for small @xmath128 ( fig .",
    "2 ) . since @xmath130 ,",
    "the small @xmath128 behavior is consistent with @xmath131 .",
    "though @xmath132 appears temptingly close to a simple rational : @xmath133 , there is no viable theory so far ( despite two valiant attempts @xcite ) . finally , let us note that the crossover from rough to smooth occurs at the scale of @xmath134 .",
    "although no precise monte carlo analysis of this crossover has been performed , it is consistent with @xmath23 having the units of 1/length . in this respect ,",
    "such a length is comparable to the capillary length which controls the crossover in the gravitationally stabilized interface .",
    "of course , in that case , the small @xmath128 behavior is simply @xmath135 !      finally , we turn to the critical region , described by @xmath136 in ( [ lang ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the situation for @xmath99 , we now need fourth - order terms in @xmath137 to stabilize the system against large - wavelength fluctuations .",
    "similarly , the nonlinear terms are required to ensure a stable ordered phase below @xmath2 .",
    "however , we still have @xmath138 , so that fourth - order _ parallel _ gradients may safely be neglected .",
    "thus , near criticality , the leading terms on the right hand side of ( [ lang ] ) are @xmath139 and @xmath140 , implying that parallel and transverse wave vectors , @xmath141 and @xmath142 , scale naively as @xmath143 , i.e. , parallel gradients are less relevant than transverse ones .",
    "more systematically , a naive dimensional analysis @xcite reveals that the nonlinearity associated with @xmath48 is the most relevant one , having an upper critical dimension @xmath144 , distinct from the usual value of @xmath145 for the ising model .",
    "dropping irrelevant terms , ( [ lang ] ) simplifies to @xmath146 with noise term ( @xmath147 ) @xmath148 here , we have rescaled @xmath62 to @xmath45 and have kept the ( naively irrelevant ) nonlinearity associated with @xmath149 , to ensure a stable theory below @xmath2 .",
    "this is the starting point for the analysis of universal critical behavior .    in this regime",
    ", large fluctuations on all length scales dominate the behavior of the system , so that renormalization group techniques are indispensable .",
    "to summarize very briefly , the langevin equation ( [ laec ] ) is recast as a dynamic functional @xcite , followed by a renormalized perturbation expansion in @xmath150 @xcite .",
    "the quartic coupling @xmath149 must be treated as a dangerously irrelevant operator .",
    "gratifyingly , the series for the critical exponents can be summed , so that we obtain _ quantitatively _ reliable values even in two dimensions .",
    "the details are quite technical @xcite , so that we just review the key results here .",
    "the discussion leading to ( [ laec ] ) already suggests that the critical behavior of the driven system is distinct from its equilibrium counterpart : the upper critical dimension is shifted to @xmath144 , and parallel and transverse wave vectors scale with different exponents .",
    "anticipating renormalization , we reformulate their scaling as @xmath151 , introducing the _ strong anisotropy _",
    "exponent @xmath152 . to illustrate its importance ,",
    "let us consider the wave vector scaling for the equilibrium ising model .",
    "for isotropic exchange interactions , coarse - graining results in the usual landau - ginzburg hamiltonian with gradient term @xmath153 . clearly , this can not lead to anything but @xmath154 .",
    "the _ only _ effect of anisotropies in the microscopic couplings is to give rise to different _ amplitudes _ , so that @xmath152 remains zero .",
    "we refer to this situation as _ weak _ anisotropy , in contrast to _",
    "strong _ anisotropy where @xmath155 .",
    "examples of the latter in equilibrium models include , e.g. , lifshitz points or structural phase transitions @xcite .    for any system with strong anisotropy ,",
    "irrespective of its universality class , the renormalization group predicts the general scaling form of , e.g. , the dynamic structure factor near criticality : @xmath156    here , @xmath157 is just a scaling factor .",
    "( [ sf ] ) can be viewed as a _ definition _ of the critical exponents @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath152 . the appearance of the latter is of course consistent with our earlier discussion .",
    "different universality classes are distinguished by the characteristic values of these exponents , expressed , e.g. , through their @xmath161-expansions . for our model ,",
    "all exponents , _ except _ @xmath152 , take their mean - field values : @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 while @xmath165 . a separate analysis yields the order parameter exponent @xmath166 .",
    "note that all of these equalities are _ exact _",
    ", i.e. , all higher order terms in the @xmath167-expansion vanish !",
    "care must be taken on two fronts , both associated with the presence of strong anisotropy , when comparing these exponents to monte carlo data .",
    "first , in the equilibrium ising model , the _ same _ exponent @xmath160 characterizes the divergence of the critical structure factor near the origin in @xmath168-space , @xmath169 as @xmath170 .",
    "in contrast , _ four _ @xmath160-like exponents are needed in the driven case ! fortunately ,",
    "scaling laws relate them to @xmath160 and @xmath152 . for example",
    ", we can _ define _ @xmath171 via @xmath172 , for @xmath173 . using ( [ sf ] )",
    ", we read off the simple result @xmath174 .",
    "similarly , we introduce @xmath175 through the relation @xmath176 , for @xmath177 . keeping track of @xmath152 in the fourier transform",
    ", we obtain the less trivial scaling law @xmath178 . since most simulations have focused on two - dimensional systems , we set @xmath179 , predicting @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "monte carlo data for the pair correlation along the drive beautifully display the expected @xmath182 decay @xcite .",
    "numerical evidence for the strong anisotropy exponent is somewhat more indirect , extracted from an anisotropic finite size scaling analysis @xcite . convincing data collapse is obtained , using anisotropic systems of size @xmath183 with fixed `` aspect '' ratio @xmath184 , for the theoretically predicted values of the exponents .",
    "it is intriguing that the signals of continuous phase transitions in or near equilibrium , namely , a diverging length scale , scale invariance and universal behavior , also mark such transitions in far - from - equilibrium scenarios .",
    "beyond the topics discussed in the previous section , we may arbitrarily name three other `` levels '' of non - equilibrium steady - state systems . the first",
    "are associated with the kls model itself , including fascinating results on higher correlations @xcite , failure of the cahn - hilliard approach to coarsening dynamics @xcite , models with _ shifted periodic _ and/or _ open _ boundary conditions @xcite , and systems with ac or random drives @xcite .",
    "topics in the next `` level '' involve various generalizations of kls , such as other interactions @xcite , multi - layer systems , multi - species models , and systems with quenched impurities @xcite .",
    "further `` afield '' is a wide range of driven systems , e.g. , surface growth , electrophoresis and sedimentation , granular and traffic flow , biological and geological systems , etc . in these brief lecture notes",
    ", we present two topics at the `` intermediate level '' : a driven bi - layer system and a model with two species .",
    "the physical motivation for considering multi - layered systems may be traced to intercalated compounds @xcite .",
    "the process of intercalation , where foreign atoms diffuse into a layered host material , is well suited for modeling by a driven lattice gas of several layers . in both physical systems and monte carlo simulations of a model with realistic parameters @xcite ,",
    "finger formation has been observed .",
    "both are transient phenomena , so that we might ask : are there any novel phenomena in the driven _ steady states _ ? on the theoretical front , there are two motivations . to study critical behavior of the single layer kls model ,",
    "it is necessary to set the overall density at 1/2 , with the consequence that two interfaces develop below criticality .",
    "these interfaces seriously complicate the analysis , since their critical behavior is quite distinct from the bulk .",
    "one way to avoid these difficulties is to consider a bi - layer system @xcite , with _ no inter - layer interactions_. through particle exchange between the layers , the system may order into a dense and a hole - rich layer , neither of which has interfaces .",
    "certainly , this is expected ( and observed ) in the equilibrium case , where the steady state is just two ising models , decoupled except for the overall conservation law .",
    "the other is using multilayer models as `` interpolations '' from two- to three - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "motivations aside , what the simulations reveal is entirely unexpected .    in the simplest generalization ,",
    "a bi - layer system is considered as a fully periodic @xmath185 model .",
    "the first simulations were carried out on the case with zero inter - layer interactions @xcite .",
    "therefore , within each layer , all aspects are identical to the kls model .",
    "particle exchanges _ across _ the layers , unaffected by the drive , are updated according to the local energetics alone , so that these jump rates are identical to a system in equilibrium .",
    "the overall particle density is fixed at 1/2 . in the absence of @xmath23",
    ", there would be a single second order transition at the onsager temperature .",
    "since the inter - layer coupling is zero , phase segregation at low temperatures will occur across the layers , i.e. , the ordered phase is characterized by homogeneous layers of different densities ( opposite magnetizations , in spin language ) . having no interfaces , the free energy of the system is clearly lowest in such a state . at @xmath186 ,",
    "one layer will be full and the other empty , so that this state will be labeled by fe .",
    "intriguingly , when @xmath23 is turned on , _ two _ transitions appear @xcite ! as @xmath1 is lowered , the homogeneous , disordered ( d ) phase first gives way to a state with strips in both layers , reminiscent of two entirely unrelated , yet aligned , single layer driven systems .",
    "we will refer to this state as the strip phase ( s ) .",
    "as @xmath1 is lowered further , a first order transition takes the s phase into the fe state .",
    "why the s state should interpose between the d and fe states was not understood .",
    "this puzzle , together with the presence of interlayer couplings in intercalated compounds , motivated our study of the _ interacting _ bi - layer driven system @xcite . within this wider context , the presence of two transitions is no longer a total mystery . on the other hand , this study reveals several unexpected features , leading to interesting new questions .",
    "our system consists of two @xmath187 ising models with attractive interparticle interactions of _ strength unity_. arranged in a bi - layer structure , the _ inter - layer _ interaction is specified by @xmath70 .",
    "thus , the `` internal '' hamiltonian is just @xmath188 where the first sum is over nearest neighbors _ within _ a given layer while @xmath7 and @xmath189 differ only by the layer index .",
    "the external drive , @xmath23 , is imposed through the jump rates , as in section ii . for simulations",
    ", we kept the overall density at 1/2 and chose @xmath190 @xmath191 $ ] .",
    "note that negative @xmath70 s are especially appropriate for intercalated materials @xcite .",
    "the eventual goal of such a study is to map out the phase diagram in the @xmath1-@xmath70-@xmath23 space .",
    "so far , we have data for only three ( positive ) values of @xmath23 .",
    "not expecting further surprises , we believe that we have uncovered the main features of the phase diagram .",
    "to begin , let us point out various features in the equilibrium case . here",
    ", the @xmath12 and the @xmath192 systems can be mapped into each other by a gauge transformation .",
    "thus , in the thermodynamic limit , the phase diagram in the @xmath193-@xmath70 plane is exactly symmetric .",
    "however , for the lattice gas constrained by a conservation law , the low temperature states of these two systems are not the same , being s or fe , respectively . while the d - s or d - fe transitions are second order ( shown as a line in fig .",
    "3 ) , the s - fe line will be first order in nature ( @xmath1 axis from 0 to 1 in fig .",
    "due to the presence of interfaces , the fe domain includes the @xmath194 line .",
    "for the same reason , it `` intrudes '' into the @xmath12 half plane by @xmath195 , for finite systems . of course , on the @xmath1 axis lies a pair of decoupled ising systems , so that @xmath196=@xmath197 assumes the onsager value , as @xmath198 . in general , @xmath199 is not known exactly , though @xmath196=@xmath200 is precisely @xmath201=@xmath197 , since every configuration of the two layers can be mapped into one in the usual ising model .",
    "the lesson from equilibrium is now clear : the s state is as generic as the fe state in this wider context . as we will see below",
    ", the presence of two transitions does not represent a qualitative change from the equilibrium phase structure .    turning to driven systems",
    ", we can no longer expect a symmetric phase diagram , since the drive breaks the ising symmetry .",
    "the data for @xmath202 are shown in fig .",
    "3 , in which the first / second order transitions are marked as solid / open circles .",
    "we see that the only effect of the drive is to shift the phase boundaries .",
    "no new phases appear while the nature of the transitions remains unchanged .",
    "however , there are remarkable features .",
    "one is the _ lowering _ of the critical temperature for large @xmath203 . given that @xmath204 in the kls model , it is quite unexpected that @xmath205 is _ less _ than its equilibrium counterpart .",
    "perhaps more notable is the presence of a small region in the @xmath192 half plane , in which an s - phase is stable .",
    "since particle - rich strips lie on top of each other , such a phase could not exist if either energy or entropy were to dominate the steady state .",
    "concerned that its presence might be a finite size effect , we performed simulations using @xmath206 s up to @xmath207 , with @xmath208 and @xmath209 $ ] . in all cases",
    ", the s - phase prevailed , leading us to conjecture that this region exists even in the thermodynamic limit . on the other hand , for lower @xmath1",
    ", the fe - phase penetrates into the @xmath12 half plane , as in equilibrium cases .",
    "energetics seem to take the upper hand here .",
    "though we believe that , as @xmath198 , this part of the phase boundary will collapse onto the @xmath210 line , we have not checked the finite size effects explicitly .",
    "of course , these `` intrusions '' into the positive / negative @xmath70 region by the fe / s - phase are responsible for the appearance of _ two _ transitions in the studies of the @xmath194 model @xcite",
    ".    it would clearly be useful to develop some intuitive arguments which can `` predict '' these qualitative modification of the equilibrium phase structure .",
    "since the usual energy - entropy considerations appear to fail , our attempt @xcite is based on the competition between suppression of short - range correlations @xcite and enhancement of long - range ones @xcite , as a result of driving .",
    "let us focus on the two - point correlations in the disordered phase with @xmath1 being lowered from @xmath211 and see how they are affected by the drive .",
    "on the one hand , the _ nearest - neighbor _ correlations are found to be suppressed by @xmath23 , consistent with the picture that the drive acts as an extra noise in breaking bonds . taken alone , this suppression would lead to the lowering of the critical temperature , as pointed out in section ii . on the other hand ,",
    "as we showed above , the drive changes significantly the large distance behavior of @xmath106 , from an exponential to a power law .",
    "further , the amplitude is positive ( negative ) for correlations parallel ( transverse ) to @xmath23 .",
    "both the positive longitudinal correlations and the negative transverse ones should help the process of ordering into strips parallel to the field .",
    "in other words , the enhanced long - range parts favor the s - phase . taken alone , we expect this effect to increase @xmath58 .",
    "evidently , for the single layer case , the latter effect `` wins '' . for a bi - layer system ,",
    "we need to take into account cross - layer correlations , which are _ necessarily _ short - ranged .",
    "focusing first on the @xmath210 case , where short - range effects due to cross - layer interactions are absent , we are led to @xmath212 . indeed , this ratio is comparable to that in the single - layer case .",
    "next , we consider systems with positive @xmath70 . without the drive ,",
    "@xmath213 is of course enhanced over @xmath214 . for non - vanishing drive",
    ", it is not possible to track the competition between the short- and long - range properties of the transverse correlations .",
    "evidently , for small @xmath70 , the long - range part still dominates , so that @xmath215 however , for @xmath216 , the presence of @xmath23 effectively lowers @xmath70 , since the latter is associated with only short - range correlations .",
    "since a lower effective @xmath70 naturally gives rise to a lower @xmath87 , we would `` predict '' that @xmath217 could decrease considerably as @xmath70 increases . from fig.3",
    ", we see that @xmath218 for @xmath219 the interplay of the competing effects is so subtle that either can dominate , in different regions of the phase diagram . finally , we turn to the @xmath192 case . here",
    ", the two effects tend to co - operate rather than compete , since the long - range parts favor the s - phase over the fe - phase . as a result , the domain of fe is smaller everywhere . in particular , note that the @xmath192 branch of @xmath220 is significantly lower than the @xmath12 branch .",
    "the small region of the s - phase can be similarly understood , at least at the qualitative level . in this picture",
    ", we may argue that the bicritical point and its trailing first order line should be `` driven '' to the @xmath192 half - plane .    to end this subsection",
    ", we point out a few other interesting features .",
    "the order parameters of the s and fe phases are conserved and non - conserved , respectively .",
    "based on symmetry arguments , we may expect that the critical properties of the two second order branches will fall into different universality classes .",
    "in contrast , the gauge symmetry forces _ static equilibrium _",
    "properties to be identical along these two branches @xcite .",
    "since the drive breaks this symmetry , we can only speculate that the d - s transitions belong to the same class as the single layer , kls model @xcite while the d - fe ones should remain in the equilibrium ising class @xcite .",
    "since these two classes are distinct , we can also expect a rich crossover structure near the bi - critical point .",
    "assuming these conjectures are confirmed , we can truly marvel at the novelties a driving field can bring .",
    "if the particles in the kls model are considered `` charged '' , it is natural to explore the effects of having both positive and negative charges . defined on a fully periodic @xmath4 square lattice ,",
    "a configuration of such a `` two species '' model can be characterized by two local occupation variables , @xmath221 and @xmath222 , which equal @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) , if a positive or negative particle is present ( absent ) at site @xmath223 . in spin language",
    ", this corresponds to a spin-@xmath45 model , and novel behavior is to be expected , since we have altered the internal symmetries of the local order parameter . for simplicity",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to zero total charge , @xmath224 . pursuing the analogy to electric charges ,",
    "positive ( negative ) charges move preferentially along ( against ) the drive @xmath23 which is directed along the @xmath14 axis . as a first step ,",
    "we assume that there are no interparticle interactions apart from an excluded volume constraint .",
    "thus , our model can be viewed as the high - temperature , large @xmath23 limit of a more complicated interacting system . to model biased diffusion , a particle with charge @xmath225 jumps onto a nearest - neighbor empty site according to @xmath226 $ ] , where @xmath227 is the change in the @xmath27-coordinate of the particle . to allow charge exchange between neighboring particles , two nearest - neighbor sites carrying opposite charge may exchange their content with probability @xmath228 $ ] .",
    "now , @xmath229 is the change in the @xmath27-coordinate of the _ positive _ particle .",
    "the parameter @xmath230 sets the ratio of the characteristic time scales controlling , respectively , charge exchange and diffusion .",
    "physical motivations for this model come from various directions : fast ionic conductors with several species of mobile charges @xcite , electric breakdown of water - in - oil microemulsions @xcite , and gel electrophoresis of charged polymers @xcite .",
    "it can also be interpreted as a simple model for some traffic or granular flows @xcite .",
    "summarizing our simulation data , we first map out the phase diagram of the model , in the space spanned by @xmath23 , the total mass density @xmath231 , and @xmath230 @xcite . focusing on small @xmath230 ,",
    "the diffusive dynamics is limited by the excluded volume constraint .",
    "for sufficiently small @xmath23 and @xmath232 , typical configurations are disordered , characterized by homogeneous charge and mass densities and fairly large currents . nevertheless , this phase is highly nontrivial , supporting anomalous two - point correlations reminiscent of the kls model : in generic directions , the familiar @xmath233 decay prevails , with the _ remarkable _ exception of the field direction , where a _ novel _",
    "@xmath234 dominates @xcite . with increasing @xmath23 or @xmath232 , the tendency of the particles to impede one",
    "another becomes more pronounced , until a phase transition into a spatially inhomogeneous `` ordered '' phase occurs . beyond the transition line @xmath235 @xmath236",
    ", typical configurations are charge - segregated , consisting of a strip of mostly positive charges `` floating '' on a similar strip of negative charges , surrounded by a background of holes .    to explore these transitions more quantitatively , we need to define a suitable order parameter . taking the fourier transforms of the local _ hole _ and _ charge _ densities , @xmath237\\exp \\{ik_{\\bot } x+ik_{\\vert } y\\}$ ] and @xmath238\\exp \\{ik_{\\bot } x+ik_{\\vert } y\\}$ ]",
    ", we select the components @xmath239 and @xmath240 since these are most sensitive to ordering into a single transverse strip .",
    "naturally , we choose their averages @xmath241 and @xmath242 as our order parameters .",
    "to distinguish first from second order transitions , we also measure their fluctuations and histograms .",
    "the resulting phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "typically , hysteresis loops in @xmath243 , @xmath244 and the average current are observed only for @xmath245 , indicating that the transitions are first order in this regime . on the other hand ,",
    "fluctuations develop sharp peaks for larger mass densities , signalling continuous transitions .",
    "larger values of @xmath230 favor the disordered phase , so that the whole transition line shifts to higher @xmath23 , the region between the spinodals narrows , and @xmath246 moves to higher mass densities .",
    "thus , we observe a surface of first order transitions , separated from a surface of continuous ones by a line of multicritical points : @xmath247 .",
    "while it is not surprising that the disordered phase is stable for large @xmath23 provided the mass density is sufficiently small , it may appear rather counterintuitive that it should also dominate the @xmath248 region .",
    "however , setting @xmath249 eliminates every hole in the system so that the dynamics is carried entirely by the charge exchange mechanism .",
    "relabelling positive charges as `` particles '' and negative ones as `` holes '' , the model becomes equivalent to a noninteracting ( i.e. , @xmath210 ) kls model . also termed the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) in the literature , its steady - state solution is exactly known @xcite to be homogeneous .",
    "thus , for all @xmath250 , our two - species model remains disordered along the entire @xmath249 line .",
    "for sufficiently large @xmath251 , the data indicate quite clearly that a _ finite _ region of disorder persists , for any @xmath23 , just _",
    "below _ complete filling . for smaller",
    "@xmath230 , however , it is less obvious whether such a region exists in the thermodynamic limit , since even a single hole can suffice to induce spatial inhomogeneities in a _",
    "finite _ system : acting as a catalyst for the charge segregation process , the hole creates a strip of predominantly positive charge , separated by a rather sharp interface from a similar , negatively charged domain , located `` downstream '' .",
    "the charge exchange mechanism tends to remix the charges but has little effect for small @xmath252 .",
    "eventually , the hole ends up trapped in the interfacial region !",
    "finally , we turn to larger values of @xmath230 , specifically , @xmath253 : here , the charge exchange mechanism dominates over the excluded volume constraint and suppresses the ordered phase completely .",
    "so far , our discussion has mostly drawn upon monte carlo results .",
    "it is gratifying , however , that the same qualitative picture emerges from a mean - field theory , based upon a set of equations of motion for the local densities .",
    "we briefly summarize the analytic route .",
    "since the numbers of both positive and negative charges are conserved , we begin with a continuity equation for the coarse - grained densities @xmath254 : @xmath255 . for simplicity , we focus on the case @xmath256 , i.e. , particle - hole exchanges , first . as for the kls model , @xmath257 can be written as the sum of a diffusive piece and an ohmic term , @xmath258 .",
    "the density - dependent mobility @xmath259 must vanish with both @xmath260 and the local hole density , @xmath261 , i.e. , @xmath262 . the `` hamiltonian '' @xmath263 is just the mixing entropy associated with distributing @xmath264 positive and @xmath265 negative charges over a lattice of @xmath266 sites .",
    "note that the functional derivative @xmath267 is taken at fixed @xmath268 since we are focusing on particle - hole exchanges here . to model the charge exchange mechanism , we simply add a similar term to @xmath257 , namely , @xmath269 where @xmath270 vanishes with both @xmath271 and @xmath272 , and the functional derivative is taken at fixed _ hole _ density . expressing the resulting equations in the more convenient variables @xmath74 and charge density @xmath273 , we obtain @xmath274 -{\\cal e}\\varphi ( 1-\\varphi ) { \\bf \\hat{y } }   \\label{2sp } \\\\ & & -\\frac{\\gamma } { 2}{\\cal e}[(1-\\varphi ) ^{2}-\\psi ^{2}]{\\bf \\hat{y}}\\ }   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these equations have to be supplemented by periodic boundary conditions and constraints on total mass and charge , @xmath275 and @xmath276 .",
    "also , to be precise , all laplacians @xmath52 should be given the appropriate anisotropic interpretation .",
    "using ( [ 2sp ] ) as our starting point , we seek to recapture the major features of the phase diagram .",
    "first , the presence of two phases , uniform vs. spatially structured , is reflected in the existence of both homogeneous and inhomogeneous steady - state solutions of ( [ 2sp ] ) .",
    "the existence of the former is evident , due to the conservation law .",
    "anticipating homogeneity in the transverse directions , we seek the latter in the form @xmath277 , @xmath278 . integrating ( [ 2sp ] ) once , the stationary mass and charge currents appear as natural integration constants",
    ". since the numbers of positive and negative charges are equal , the former must be zero , leaving us with the latter : @xmath70 .",
    "the first equation allows us to eliminate @xmath279 in favor of @xmath74 , and , with @xmath280 as the new variable , we can reduce the second equation to potential form , @xmath281 .",
    "the potential @xmath282 , given explicitly in @xcite , exhibits a minimum for a range of @xmath70 s , so that inhomogeneous , periodic solutions of ( [ 2sp ] ) exist .",
    "we note in passing that these may even be found explicitly , provided @xmath256 @xcite .",
    "otherwise , numerical integration is of course always possible , yielding rather impressive agreement with simulation profiles .",
    "interestingly , our equations of motion predict that @xmath48 enters only through the _ scaling variable _ @xmath283 .",
    "if plotted accordingly , our simulation data confirm this scaling by collapsing rather convincingly , at least within their error bars .    however , the mere _ existence _ of two types of steady - state solutions is not sufficient to provide evidence for a phase transition .",
    "therefore , we seek instabilities of these solutions , as the control parameters @xmath48 , @xmath232 and @xmath230 are varied . performing a linear stability analysis , we find that a _ homogeneous _ solution with mass @xmath232 becomes unstable if the drive @xmath48 exceeds a threshold value @xmath284}}$ ] .",
    "the most relevant perturbation is associated with the smallest wave vector in the parallel direction , @xmath285 .",
    "a simple analysis of @xmath286 shows that this instability can only occur within the interval @xmath287 , so that , in particular , the homogeneous phase is always stable for @xmath288 .",
    "clearly , we can not identify this mean - field stability boundary with the true transition line : we have not considered the locus of instabilities associated with _",
    "inhomogeneous _ solutions , and fluctuations have been neglected throughout .",
    "however , it is quite remarkable how well it mirrors the qualitative shape of the phase diagram .",
    "finally , let us consider the _ order _ of the transitions . in principle , two routes can be pursued here .",
    "one of these , namely , the computation of the stability boundary of the _ inhomogeneous _ phase , @xmath289 , is rather subtle , involving three goldstone modes @xcite .",
    "once @xmath290 is known , values @xmath291 for which @xmath292 and @xmath293 coincide can be identified as loci of continuous transitions ; otherwise , @xmath293 and @xmath292 mark the `` spinodals '' , near a first order transition , where the homogeneous / inhomogeneous phases become linearly unstable . alternatively , the adiabatic elimination of the fast modes results in an effective equation of motion for the slow ones which can then be analyzed .",
    "since the technical details of this approach can be found in @xcite , we need only focus on the result which combines the expected with the surprising . letting @xmath294 denote the _ complex _ amplitude of the unique slow mode , associated with the band of wave vectors @xmath295 , its equation of motion takes the ginzburg - landau form : @xmath296 . here , @xmath59 is the soft eigenvalue , which vanishes on the stability boundary and @xmath297 is a rather complicated function . as in standard landau theory",
    ", the sign of @xmath298 determines the order of the transition : if positive , the transition is continuous while negative @xmath298 signals a first order one . since @xmath299",
    ", we can set @xmath300 and discuss @xmath298 on the stability boundary itself : being positive for @xmath248 , it has a unique zero at a critical @xmath301 , below which it becomes negative .",
    "since @xmath246 increases with @xmath230 , we recover the qualitative behavior of the multicritical line observed in the simulations .",
    "the _ surprising _ aspect of this equation of motion , however , resides in the fact that @xmath302 is o(2)-symmetric and @xmath303 spans just a single spatial dimension . given these symmetries",
    ", the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite should forbid the existence of long - range order !",
    "one might hope that a careful analysis of finite - size effects in this system would contribute to the disentanglement of this puzzle .",
    "we conclude with two comments .",
    "first , we noted earlier that the case @xmath304 is exactly soluble .",
    "there are , in fact , two other surfaces in the phase diagram , corresponding to @xmath305 and @xmath306 , for which certain distributions are exactly known .",
    "setting @xmath305 implies that the rates for particle - hole and particle - particle exchanges become equal , so that any given particle , e.g. , a positive charge , can not distinguish between negative charges and holes .",
    "thus , it experiences biased diffusion , equivalent to the non - interacting kls model .",
    "accordingly , the _ marginal _ steady - state distribution of the occupation numbers of _ one _ species is uniform , i.e. , @xmath307 = \\sum_{\\{n_{{\\bf r}% } ^{\\mp } \\}}p\\left [ \\{n_{{\\bf r}}^{+},n_{{\\bf r}}^{-}\\}\\right ] \\propto 1 $ ] , and observables pertaining to a single species are trivial . for example , the two - point correlation functions for equal charges , @xmath308 and @xmath309 , vanish for @xmath310 .",
    "full _ *  * distribution , @xmath311 $ ] , however , is nontrivial , so that , e.g. , the two - point function for _ opposite _ charges , @xmath312 , remains long - ranged @xcite .",
    "a completely random system , marked by a uniform @xmath311 $ ] results only if @xmath306 .",
    "finally , we note that the one - dimensional version of our model is exactly soluble by matrix methods @xcite .",
    "second , it is natural to wonder about the consequences of having non - zero charge .",
    "this problem has only been investigated for @xmath256 @xcite , but the findings are quite remarkable .",
    "the system still orders into a charge - segregated strip , while supporting a _ nonvanishing _ mass current , reflected in an overall drift .",
    "if , e.g. , positive charges outnumber negative ones , one might expect that the whole strip would drift in the field direction - in analogy with american football , where the team with fewer players tends to lose ground .",
    "in contrast , the strip wanders _ against _ the field , following the preferred direction of the minority charge !    we should add that this model possesses several other intriguing properties , e.g. , stable configurations with nontrivial winding number ( `` barber poles '' ) @xcite or multiple - valued currents in the mean - field description @xcite . to summarize , the remarkable richness of this deceptively simple system is clearly amazing .",
    "we have presented , within the limited scope of these lecture notes , a brief introduction to the statistical mechanics of driven diffusive systems and some recent developments in this ever expanding field .",
    "focusing only on the prototype model and two of the simplest generalizations , we pointed out a multitude of surprises , when we base our expectations on the experience with equilibrium systems . while some of these , e.g. , the generic presence of singular correlations , are rather well understood , others , such as the nature of ordering in two - species models , remain unresolved .",
    "of course , the holy grail of this whole field , namely , the fundamental understanding and theoretical classification of non - equilibrium steady states , still beckons at the distant horizon .",
