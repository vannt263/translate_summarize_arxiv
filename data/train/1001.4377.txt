    "the origin of this frequency shift with temperature is the increase in tension in graphene due to the expansion / contraction of substrate , gold electrodes and graphene .",
    "the frequency shift can be understood by taking into account the contribution of various strains as the device is cooled below 300  k. the three main contributions are  firstly , the thermal strain in unconstrained graphene @xmath60 due to the coefficient of thermal expansion of graphene @xmath2 , second , the thermal strain due to the gold electrodes @xmath61 and lastly the contribution of the strain induced by the substrate @xmath62 ; here @xmath63 is the coefficient of thermal expansion for gold @xcite .",

    "the elastic strain in the curved substrate can be calculated using stoney s equation @xcite .",
    "its contribution to the net strain in the graphene membrane is very small ( see supplementary information ) and therefore upon cooling , change of tension in the graphene is due to contraction of gold electrode and expansion / contraction of graphene .",
    "we assume that young s modulus of graphene does not vary significantly over the temperature range @xcite . at the interface of gold electrodes supporting the graphene membrane ,",
    "the net force must balance to zero ; however , the stresses are different considering the crossectional area of gold electrodes ( @xmath0500 nm @xmath64 60 nm ) and graphene ( @xmath0500 nm @xmath65 0.3 nm ) .",

    "however , this rate of increase of resonant frequency is significantly reduced due to the negative @xmath70 for all t@xmath71  k from the case of frequency change including only gold s contraction . using such a measurement of frequency shift while assuming uniform expansion of all the materials and using equation  [ eq : equation2 ] , it is possible to calculate the expansion coefficient from the frequency at @xmath72  v as @xmath73 figure [ fig :",

    "is to ensure that the @xmath77 ( using equation [ eq : equation4 ] ) .",
    "additionally , these measurements indicate that using nems resonators for measuring internal stress of nanowires of metal and phase change materials as a function of temperature , using phase locked loop ( pll ) technique @xcite , can provide useful information about stresses and strains in individual nanostructures .    here",
    ", it is important to point out that , residue on the graphene sheet can also affect the calculations of the coefficient of thermal expansion .",
    "this can possibly be one reason for its deviation from the theoretically predicted values . in our calculation",
    ", we have assumed that presence of residue does not affect the expansion of graphene , which may not be the complete description of the experimental system .",
    "however , these values of @xmath70 still remain valuable for device engineering as the complete elimination of the resist residue from the device is difficult .",

    ", width=321 ]    the two limiting cases of modal dispersion  pure positively and negatively dispersing modes can be respectively understood by considering the limits where the tension ( or in the case of flexural modes mechanical rigidity ) dominates with increasing @xmath8 and the case when capacitive pulling leading to the softening of the spring constant dominates @xcite .",
    "a simple model @xcite to understand the intermediate regime where these two interactions compete is to model the resonator with an intrinsic spring constant @xmath79 with @xmath80 and @xmath81 as constants of the system ( when @xmath82 , this is consistent with the positive dispersion of modes with an increased @xmath8 )",
    ". a second contribution due to the electrostatic interaction ( capacitive coupling ) , softens the intrinsic spring constant @xmath83 so that the effective spring constant @xmath84 with @xmath16 being the capacitive coupling of the membrane with gate electrode",
    ". as @xmath8 is varied the @xmath85 varies and the modal dispersion changes from a negatively dispersing mode to a positively dispersing mode at large @xmath8  the value of @xmath8 at which the crossover happens is a measure of the relative contribution of capacitive and elastic energies .",
    "this phenomenological model describes the generalized modal dispersion and can be connected to the properties of the resonator ( described in supplementary information ) . @xmath80 and",
    "@xmath81 depend on temperature through the coefficient of thermal expansion , and also on the elastic constant of graphene ; as a result they change with temperature , leading to the evolution of modal dispersion as a function of temperature .",
    "additionally the capacitive contribution to energy is expected to change as a function of temperature .",
    "the observed modal dispersion behavior at all temperature can be qualitatively understood from the contraction of the suspended gold electrodes with temperature , which leads to increased tension in the membrane .",
    "this increase in in - built tension is accompanied by the reduction in tunability with @xmath8 ( model described in the the supplementary information ) .",
    "results of our calculation ( figure [ fig : figure3]c ) clearly show that we can successfully model the temperature evolution of dispersion , using only a single fit parameter in our model .",
    "it is critical to understand the origin of observed dispersion of resonant frequency as a function of temperature due to the desirable property of resonator  its tunability .",
    "additionally , if the loss mechanisms are frequency independent such tunability can increase the @xmath1 of the system @xcite .    in order to use graphene electromechanical resonators for applications like mass and charge sensing it is important to understand the microscopic origin of the modes and to test the suitability of continuum models @xcite beyond basic properties such as dispersion . scanned probe measurements to image modes @xcite indicate that the origin of these modes is complex  for instance some of the modes are associated with the edges of the graphene membrane .",
    "the reason this is critical is that the notion of effective mass of mechanical modes @xcite is associated with the spatial distribution of the mode .",
    "we try to understand the nature of modes in graphene resonators by studying devices with multiple resonances in the measurement frequency window .",
    "figure [ fig : figure4]a shows two higher order modes along with fundamental mode for a graphene resonator at 7  k. the dispersions of these three modes are different . though it is difficult to determine the exact nature of these modes using our technique , a semi - quantitative explanation is provided here . at lower temperatures ,",
    "negative dispersion can be understood in terms of spring constant softening as discussed earlier .",
    "following equation  [ eq : springsoft ] , the effective spring constant @xmath85 can be used to calculate the modal dispersion with gate voltage  ( @xmath8 ) , @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 is the effective mass for a given mode @xcite .",
    "using equation  [ eq : frqsoft ] , we can describe the higher modes also by using @xmath38 and modal mass ( @xmath88 ) as the fitting parameters . for a sheet under tension with uniform loading , the effective modal mass ( @xmath88 ) for different modes does not change , unlike the case of flexural modes , and is equal to @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "however , our fitting gives different effective masses for different modes , which is expected as these are not the higher order harmonics of the fundamental mode ( in the model described above , the higher order modes will be integral multiples of the fundamental mode ) .",
    "this suggests that the simple picture of rectangular membrane under tension within the continuum description does not work well to describe the system",
    ". this could be due to four main reasons : a ) non - uniform loading of the membrane ( due to resist residue ) @xcite can modify the @xmath88 for different modes , b ) due to the presence of edge dependent modes @xcite , c ) due to the curvature of membrane @xcite or rippling of graphene @xcite ( as seen in figure [ fig : figure1]a ) the effective stiffness of the modes could be a very complex quantity with a tensor nature and could be significantly different from the ideal value of @xmath0 1  tpa as observed for the case of rippled carbon nanotubes @xcite and d ) the capacitance to gate ( @xmath16 ) for the graphene membrane is likely to be mode dependent .",
    "further experiments with pristine unrippled graphene resonators are needed to clarify our understanding of the microscopic origin of modes .",

    "to conclude , our measurements of @xmath1 , for graphene resonators , as a function of dc gate voltage indicate that larger dissipation in the resonator can occur around the dirac point .",
