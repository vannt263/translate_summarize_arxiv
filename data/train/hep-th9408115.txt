    "18.5pt    although qcd is a relatively old subject , the nonperturbative calculation of physically significant quantities in this theory is poorly understood .",
    "two - dimensional pure qcd , however , does admit a nonperturbative exact solution [ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "recent work [ 4 - 8 ] has shown further that there is string theory description of pure two - dimensional gauge theories with various gauge groups .",
    "it is hoped that some modification of this string picture will provide a systematic nonperturbative description of qcd in any dimension .",
    "a particularly interesting feature of two - dimensional qcd is that when the theory is considered on a two - sphere , there is a phase transition between the large and small area limits of the large @xmath0 gauge theory .",
    "it was shown by douglas and kazakov @xcite that the string expansion is asymptotic to the full nonperturbative qcd@xmath5 partition function only when the dimensionless area is greater than @xmath6 ; below this value , the theory simplifies dramatically and is essentially a free theory described by a master field satisfying the wigner semicircle law .",
    "the existence of this phase transition raises the question of whether an analogous transition will occur in the four dimensional theory .",
    "such a phase transition would mean that a calculation in the strong coupling regime would be unable to make useful predictions about physics at weak coupling , so it is certainly important to understand the nature of this type of phase transition .",
    "gross and matytsin @xcite have studied the dk phase transition from the point of view of the weak coupling expansion .",
    "they found that for weak coupling ( in two dimensions ) , there are nonperturbative instanton contributions to the partition function which vanish in the asymptotic expansion below the critical point but which give rise to an infinite instanton density above that point , driving the dk phase transition .",
    "an analogous calculation indicated that this mechanism might not cause a phase transition in four dimensions .",
    "the phase transition has also been studied from the string point of view in @xcite .",
    "analytic and numerical results indicate that the string expansion has a radius of convergence which coincides with the critical point . in the string language ,",
    "the transition is driven by the entropy of branch point singularities in the string maps .",
    "( the formula for this entropy which was conjectured in @xcite is proven in this paper . )",
    "although these studies have given us some understanding of the reasons for the phase transition in two - dimensional qcd , there are still many unanswered questions . studying similar phase transitions in closely related theories may give insights into the structure of these transitions .",
    "an interesting feature of the large @xmath0 qcd theory in two dimensions is that the theory almost exactly factorizes into two copies of a simpler , `` chiral '' theory @xcite .",
    "the chiral theory encapsulates most of the important features in the geometry of the underlying string theory , and seems worthy of study as a theory in its own right .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study a chiral sector of the two - dimensional gauge theory on the sphere and to determine its large @xmath0 phase structure .",
    "we find that the chiral theory contains 3 distinct phases , as opposed to the 2 phases of the combined theory .",
    "furthermore , we find that the same analytic formulae describe both the large and small area limits ; in analogy with what was found in @xcite . these formulae also reproduce the asymptotic string expansion .",
    "this suggests that the chiral theory , which is not yet well understood from the point of view of the large @xmath0 gauge theory , may have unexpected duality properties .    in section 2",
    "we briefly describe the qcd@xmath5 string and review the large @xmath0 theory and the douglas - kazakov phase transition .",
    "we define the chiral theory and give an ansatz for the matrix model corresponding to this theory .",
    "section 3 contains a saddle point evaluation of the chiral partition function .",
    "we find a class of single - cut saddle point solutions which agree order by order with the string expansion and which are defined for large and small areas , but not in an intermediate region . in section 4 , the single - cut solution is used to derive a previously conjectured formula for the number of sphere to sphere maps with @xmath3 branch points . in section 5",
    "we find double - cut solutions for the saddle point equations and show that these solutions interpolate exactly between the regions of weak and strong coupling given by the single - cut solutions .",
    "section 6 contains a discussion of our results and related issues .",
    "18.5pt    the partition function of two - dimensional yang - mills theory on a compact manifold with genus @xmath7 and area @xmath2 is given by the exact formula @xcite @xmath8 { \\rm e}^{- { 1\\over 4 g^2 } \\int_{\\cal m }   { \\rm tr } ( f \\wedge^{\\large \\star } f ) } \\nonumber\\\\    & = & \\sum_{r } ( \\dim r)^{2 - 2 g }    { \\rm e}^{-\\frac{a}{2 n}c_2(r ) } , \\label{eq : partition}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum is taken over all irreducible representations of the gauge group , with @xmath9 and @xmath10 being the dimension and quadratic casimir of the representation @xmath11 .",
    "we absorb the coupling constant @xmath12 into the dimensionless area @xmath2 throughout this paper .",
    "we are interested in studying the yang - mills theories with gauge groups @xmath1 and @xmath13 . the irreducible representations of these gauge groups are associated with young diagrams with row lengths @xmath14 , where for @xmath1 the row lengths satisfy @xmath15 and for @xmath13 @xmath16 we denote the sum of the row lengths by @xmath17 . in terms of the row lengths , the dimension of a representation @xmath11 is given by @xmath18 for @xmath1 the quadratic casimir is given by @xmath19 and for @xmath13 we have @xmath20    in @xcite the asymptotic expansion in @xmath21 of the @xmath13 partition function ( [ eq : partition ] ) was described in terms of a string theory of covering maps .",
    "this asymptotic expansion was constructed by summing over a subset of representations called `` composite '' large @xmath0 representations ; these are essentially the representations whose quadratic casimir has a leading term of order @xmath0 .",
    "composite representations are formed by taking the tensor product of a representation @xmath11 corresponding to a young diagram with a finite number of boxes , and a representation @xmath22 corresponding to the complex conjugate of a representation @xmath23 associated with another diagram with a finite number of boxes .",
    "the resulting large @xmath0 expansion of ( [ eq : partition ] ) essentially factorizes into two copies of a simpler , `` chiral '' string expansion .",
    "the chiral expansion arises from restricting the sum to only representations corresponding to diagrams with a finite number of boxes .",
    "the string geometry of the chiral theory is simpler than that of the full theory because in the chiral theory all maps from the string world sheet to the target space have the same relative orientation , so the theory can be viewed as a theory of orientation - preserving string maps .",
    "the chiral qcd@xmath4 string theory has recently been constructed by cordes , moore , and ramgoolam in terms of a topological string theory @xcite ; related work appears in @xcite .    in the string expansion of ( [ eq : partition ] ) , a term of order @xmath24 in the partition function is interpreted as arising from a ( possibly disconnected ) string world sheet of genus @xmath25 .",
    "the dimension of a representation associated with a young diagram containing a finite number @xmath3 of boxes has a leading term of order @xmath26 .",
    "thus , when the genus @xmath7 is greater than 1 , the leading order nontrivial term in the chiral partition function is of order @xmath27 and arises from the fundamental representation ( with young diagram 0.9pt ) . in the full @xmath13 theory , both the fundamental representation and its conjugate contribute terms of order @xmath27 . because in these cases only a finite number of terms contribute to the leading order term in the partition function , the large @xmath0 theory with @xmath28 clearly can not have a phase transition at leading order .",
    "when @xmath29 , the contribution of the dimension factor to the partition function vanishes and so all representations contribute to the @xmath30 term .",
    "however , in this case the contribution of all the terms can easily be summed and found to give a theory with no phase transitions at leading order .",
    "the leading term in the free energy of this theory corresponds in the string picture to a summation over unbranched covers of a torus by a torus .    for the spherical case @xmath31 , however , the situation is more complicated . in the partition function ,",
    "terms corresponding to young diagrams with @xmath3 boxes give rise to terms of order @xmath32 .",
    "the free energy of the string expansion , given by the logarithm of the partition function , has a leading term of order @xmath33 .",
    "however , an infinite number of string diagrams contribute to the coefficient of this leading term , and so a phase transition in the leading order term can not be ruled out .    the possibility of a phase transition in the genus 0 free energy was investigated in @xcite .",
    "these papers considered the @xmath1 theory , using the continuum variables @xmath34 to describe young diagrams in the large @xmath0 limit .",

    "however , for values of @xmath46 , the wigner semicircle solution violates the constraint @xmath47 . in order to deal with this problem",
    ", douglas and kazakov ( dk ) adopted the ansatz that the function @xmath48 should be identically equal to 1 in a region @xmath49 $ ] , and should be between 0 and 1 in the regions @xmath50 and @xmath51 for some @xmath52 .",
    "this ansatz was physically motivated by the idea that above the critical area , the density function @xmath43 would become saturated to its maximum value of 1 in a region symmetric around the origin , due to the symmetry of the quadratic potential .",
    "using this ansatz , dk solved the integral equation ( [ eq : integral1 ] ) in the nonconstant regions of @xmath43 , and found an expression for @xmath48 and the leading term in the derivative of the free energy in terms of complete elliptic functions .",
    "they found a third order phase transition separating the large and small @xmath2 phases at @xmath53 , and verified that the free energy in the large area phase agrees with the string expansion .    in subsequent work @xcite",
    ", it was pointed out by minahan and polychronakos ( mp ) that the symmetric form of the dk ansatz effectively restricts the saddle point to the @xmath54 @xmath55 charge sector of the @xmath1 theory .",

    ", they found a more general set of solutions for the @xmath1 theory , where for a fixed value of @xmath2 there is a range of solutions corresponding to different values of the @xmath55 charge @xmath59 .",
    "mp did not ascertain whether the value of the free energy was larger or smaller on these additional solutions , so that it is not clear whether these other possible saddle points affect the free energy of the theory .",
    "however , it was shown in @xcite that the free energy of the complete @xmath13 theory is equal to the free energy of the @xmath54 @xmath1 theory in the large area phase where the string expansion is valid .",

    "the upper boundary of the region of solutions is given by the curve describing the single - cut solution above @xmath119 .",
    "the cusp point at the bottom of the region is precisely the lower critical point .",
    "note that there the value of @xmath94 is the value of @xmath71 at which the `` bump '' in @xmath43 ( see figure  [ f : u ] ) touches @xmath225 , and not the value defined in the single - cut solution , which is now taken by @xmath226 at that point .",
    "the constraint @xmath227 must be satisfied for all @xmath71 in order for the solution @xmath48 to correspond to a young diagram at large @xmath0 .",
    "this condition can be used to describe analytically the remaining boundary curves of the physically acceptable region in figure  [ f:4 ] .",
    "as one varies @xmath212 in such a way as to satisfy ( [ eq : cond2a ] ) , ( [ eq : cond2b ] ) , and ( [ eq : cond2c ] ) , the solution ( [ eq : u2 ] ) first fails this condition at the points @xmath228 and @xmath94 .",
    "thus , we can find the boundaries of the double - cut problem simply by studying the slope of the solution @xmath188 at the points @xmath228 and @xmath94 .",
    "the boundary of the double - cut solutions arising from the condition that @xmath229 is @xmath230 this is the boundary curve at the bottom of the physical region .",
    "an analysis of the slope of the solution @xmath188 near the point @xmath94 , ( _ i.e. _ , requiring @xmath231 ) yields an equation for the final boundary of the double - cut region .",
    "it reads @xmath232 one finds that the solutions at these boundaries are indeed legal solutions , so the double - cut region is closed .",
    "it is easy to verify that the @xmath231 boundary runs precisely between the @xmath233 and @xmath234 .",
    "having found these new saddle points of the action ( [ eq : action ] ) we now study their contribution to the partition function . to begin with , we can see from figure  [ f:4 ] that for all @xmath235 there is indeed a one parameter family of solutions to the saddle point equation",
    ". however , not all these solutions are actually saddle points , since the saddle point equation is only satisfied in the interior of the regions @xmath67 and @xmath196 . to determine which of the values is the physical saddle point for any given @xmath2 it would be necessary to compute the exact free energy @xmath207 and to maximize this quantity across all solutions corresponding to that fixed value of @xmath2 .    unfortunately , however , an exact calculation of the free energy is technically difficult .",
    "the situation here is analogous to that which arises in the full qcd@xmath4 theory . in that case , it was shown by minahan and polychronakos @xcite that for every value of @xmath2 above the critical value @xmath6 there is a family of solutions to the saddle point equation , parameterized by the parameter @xmath59 corresponding to the @xmath55 charge , which is essentially the first moment of @xmath48 . in that case also , a direct calculation of the free energy is difficult .",
    "symmetry arguments would indicate that the dk solutions with @xmath55 charge @xmath236 are the physical saddle points in this theory .",
    "the correspondence of the strong coupling expansion of the dk solutions with the qcd@xmath4 string gives further weight to this conclusion ; however this result has not been rigorously proven .    in the chiral theory",
    ", we no longer have a reflection symmetry to rely on ; however , the correspondence of the strong coupling expansion of the single - cut solution with the chiral string theory is a strong indication that the free energy is extremized by the single - cut solutions above @xmath121 .",
    "we have numerically integrated the free energy in that region and found that indeed @xmath207 seems to be maximized on the single - cut solution for any fixed @xmath131 .",
    "the behavior of the theory in the intermediate phase , however , presents a much more subtle problem . numerically integrating @xmath207 indicates that the physical solutions in the intermediate phase lie near or on the boundary ( [ eq : cboundary ] ) .",
    "the numerical analysis of @xmath207 in this region is extremely delicate , presumably due to the existence of phase transitions at @xmath237 .",
    "thus , although we have fairly solid evidence that the single - cut solution describes the physical saddle point above @xmath119 , we are unable to give an exact formula for the curve corresponding to the physical solutions connecting the two critical points .",
    "nonetheless , we can compute the derivative of the free energy along the physical curve using the same method as was used in section 3 to calculate @xmath238 in the single - cut region . from the fact that the physical saddle point obeys the classical equations of motion",
    ", we find that the derivative of the free energy is related to the second moment of the density function @xmath48 by @xmath239 after some algebra one ascertains that @xmath240 where @xmath241 and where @xmath242 using the constraint equations ( [ eq : cond2a ] , [ eq : cond2b ] , [ eq : cond2c ] ) allows us to write this expression in terms of algebraic functions of the area @xmath2 and the points @xmath212 , @xmath243 as a simple check note that in the limit @xmath244 this expression leads to the result of ( [ eq : free ] ) . we have thus given an explicit formula for the derivative of the free energy in the double - cut region which is applicable to whatever curve describes the physical solutions in that region , although we have been unable to describe the curve analytically .",
    "if one could derive an analytic formula for the physical solutions in the intermediate region , ( [ eq : uh22 ] ) could be used to calculate the order of the phase transition at the two critical points .",
    "18.5pt    we have developed a matrix model that describes a single chiral sector of the qcd@xmath5 string .",
    "the analysis indicates that there are three distinct regimes for solutions of the saddle point equation of the chiral theory on the sphere .",
    "we have shown that there exists a simple single - cut solution which exists for large and small areas and which agrees with the string picture in an expansion around large area . however",
    ", this single - cut solution ends ( stops leading to physically viable solutions ) as one decreases the area from infinity and also as one increases the area from zero .",
    "thus the single - cut solution can not describe the system for areas @xmath187 .",
    "we have shown that for these intermediate areas a saddle point may be found as a double - cut solution to the ( integral ) equation of motion .",
    "this double - cut solution limits to the single - cut solution in the large area regime and connects the upper and lower branches of the single - cut solution . for any fixed @xmath224",
    "there is a one - parameter continuum of saddle point solutions .",
    "when @xmath131 , we have fairly conclusive evidence that the single - cut solution dominates the theory . however , in the intermediate regime we can not calculate exactly where the curve describing the physical saddle point lies .",
    "in fact , although we believe there is only a single curve with maximum free energy connecting the two points @xmath119 and @xmath120 , it is conceivable that there may be multiple physical saddle points in this intermediate region , although numerical evidence indicates that there is indeed only a single such curve , which lies near or on the @xmath231 boundary ( [ eq : cboundary ] ) .    despite our uncertainty regarding the exact location of the intermediate saddle point curve , our analysis gives a fairly complete picture of the theory at any @xmath2 .",
    "the dominant stationary solutions are the single - cut solutions for @xmath245 and @xmath246 and there are likely to be a simple trajectory of solutions in the double - cut region that interpolate between these single - cut solutions .",
    "the fact that the physical curve of solutions in @xmath247 space , as well as the solutions @xmath48 , undergo discontinuities at the points @xmath119 and @xmath120 indicates that there are probably phase transitions at these points .",
    "the behavior of the density function @xmath48 at the point @xmath120 is closely analogous to that of the full qcd@xmath4 density function at the dk phase transition point , suggesting that the chiral theory probably has a third order phase transition at this point .",
    "however , an exact characterization of phase transitions in the chiral theory will not be possible until a method is found for determining which of the solutions in the double - cut region actually dominate the partition sum .",
    "if this could be accomplished , it would then be straightforward in principle to compute the order of the phase transition at the critical points simply by comparing power series expansions of the free energy @xmath99 on either side of the critical points .",
    "the single - cut solution of the matrix model gave us an exact analytic formula for the large area regime of the chiral theory . because this exact formula has a series expansion which is equal to the leading ( @xmath33 ) term in the free energy of the chiral string theory",
    ", we were able to relate the terms in this expansion to sums over maps between riemann surfaces .",
    "in particular , a calculation of the leading terms in the area polynomials of the expansion allowed us to derive a previously conjectured result on the number of sphere to sphere maps . an interesting direction for further",
    "work might be to find further structure in the analytic equations for the large area chiral theory and to relate this structure to the geometry of string maps .",
    "it is remarkable that the location of the critical point bounding the large area phase is relatively insensitive to the details of the theory in question .",
    "the result proven here for the number of sphere to sphere maps was used in @xcite to show that in a chiral theory with branch points , but without @xmath164-points , the critical point occurs near @xmath248 . in this paper we found that the @xmath164-points in the chiral theory shift the critical point to near @xmath249 , which is extremely close to the dk critical point in the coupled theory at @xmath250 .",
    "one particularly surprising feature of the results given here is the fact that although the chiral theory apparently has three distinct phases , the large and small area phases are in fact described by the same analytic expressions , indicating some type of duality between these two phases .",
    "this situation also bears an striking similarity to the results of @xcite where the convergence properties of the string expansion were studied for both the chiral and coupled qcd@xmath4 theories . in that analysis",
    ", it was shown that the string expansion of the chiral theory has a radius of convergence approximately equal to the point @xmath119 , but that the string series also converges for very small areas . a numerical comparison ,",
    "however , shows that the results of the matrix model disagree with the explicit string sum for small area .",
    "the small area phase we have described in this work of course lies outside the radius of convergence of the large area phase .",
    "thus , the fact that the string sum did converge for small @xmath2 seems mysterious .    in order to further understand the chiral qcd@xmath4 matrix model we have described here",
    ", it would be interesting to study directly the free energy of this model . a way of analytically describing the dominant saddle points for @xmath187 in this model would be invaluable for the computation of the order of the phase transition across the critical loci .",
    "furthermore , an understanding of how to compute @xmath207 directly might shed some light on the significance of the one - parameter families of solutions described in @xcite for the full qcd@xmath4 large @xmath0 theory .",
