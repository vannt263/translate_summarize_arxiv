    "recent studies suggest that our universe can be described well by a cosmological model called the concordance @xmath2 cold dark matter ( cdm ) model with a matter energy density @xmath3 and a dark energy density @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite based on this backbone of structure formation , we would like to build a self - consistent model of galaxy formation that can describe the formation of disk , spheroid , and black holes .",
    "in particular , we would like to understand how the gas turned into stars as a function of cosmic time and environment .",
    "observations of dlas provide very unique opportunities for that purpose . because dlas are observed in absorption , .",
    "see ref .   for an extensive review on dlas .",
    "] they are _ in principle _ an unbiased sample of hi  in the universe , and provide us with information that are complementary to those obtained by direct observations of stellar emission .",
    "for example , with dlas we can measure the global hi  mass density in the universe as a function of redshift.@xcite it has been estimated that dlas contain a significant fraction of hi  gas in the universe at @xmath5 , with the amount roughly equal to a half of current stellar mass density . @xcite therefore dlas are considered to be important reservoirs of neutral gas for star formation in high-@xmath1  universe , and their study would reveal the physical properties of neutral gas before they turn into stars .",
    "the conversion history of neutral gas into stars has been an active area of research over the past ten years , @xcite and the connection between dlas and star - forming galaxies such as lbgs@xcite is becoming one of the focus of current dla research .    in recent years",
    ", observers have made significant progress in constraining the statistical properties of dlas using large samples of high-@xmath1  quasars discovered by surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss)@xcite . for example , ref .",
    "have extracted @xmath6 dlas from the sdss data release 3 and tightened the constraints on the column density distribution function and the rate of incidence .",
    "the total number of detected dlas has reached over 1000 as of early 2007 ( prochaska , private communication ) . increased accuracy in these observables set tight constraints on the models of galaxy formation .    in turn , theoretical understanding of dlas remain unsatisfactory .",
    "currently there are mainly two competing views on the physical origin of dlas .",
    "one idea is that dlas originate from rapidly rotating , massive disk galaxies.@xcite this model can explain the large velocity widths of low - ionization metal absorption lines .",
    "however , ref .   used hydrodynamic simulations to argue that the asymmetric profiles of low - ionization absorption lines can also be explained by the rotation , random motions , infall , and merging of protogalactic gas clumps equally well .",
    "somewhat intermediate idea is intersecting multiple disks @xcite or tidal tails observed in merging systems .",
    "there are a number of dla studies using so - called semianalytic models of galaxy formation@xcite , but it would also be desirable to study dlas using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that directly solve the gas dynamics within the framework of @xmath7cdm universe . ref .   & focused on the effects of star formation and supernova ( sn ) feedback on dlas that were largely neglected by the earlier numerical work , @xcite and showed that the distribution of dlas could be significantly affected by sn feedback . ref .",
    "studied the effects of radiative transfer by post - processing the results of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations , but their simulations did not include models for star formation and sn feedback .",
    "it is still difficult to treat the radiative transfer dynamically from all galaxies in a large volume of space , as well as star formation and feedback by sne and active galactic nuclei in large - scale cosmological hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "this is primarily due to the heavy computational load required for such a simulation with full treatment of all physical processes . at the moment",
    ", we need to limit our calculation to a small number of objects in order to treat radiative transfer self - consistently with the star formation in simulations .    in this review article , we summarize our recent numerical studies on dlas using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "we discuss the conflicts and agreement between simulations and observations , and the future directions of theoretical research on dlas .",
    "we use cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code gadget-2 ( springel 2005 ) for our study .",
    "the code solves the hydrodynamics in a lagrangian fashion by allowing the gas particles to cluster in high density regions , thereby providing higher resolution in galaxy - forming regions .",
    "the gravity is solved by a tree - particle - mesh method that uses a tree algorithm for the short - range force and particle - mesh technique for the long - range force .",
    "it also adopts the entropy - conservative formulation@xcite to remedy the overcooling problem , which previous generation of cosmological sph codes suffered from .",
    "the code includes radiative cooling , heating by a uniform uv background radiation of a modified haardt & madau spectrum@xcite , star formation , supernova feedback , galactic wind@xcite , and a sub - resolution multiphase model of interstellar medium ( ism)@xcite .",
    "we employ a series of simulations with different resolution , box sizes ( from @xmath8 to @xmath9 ) and feedback strengths to study their effects .",
    "one of the focus of our study is to examine the effects of galactic wind feedback on the distribution of dlas . in this article",
    ", we summarize our results by referring to two cases : ` no wind ' feedback and ` strong wind ' feedback , corresponding to the wind speed of @xmath10 and 484kms@xmath11 .",
    "see ref .   for more details of our simulations .",
    "all of our simulations are based on a concordance @xmath2cdm cosmology with cosmological parameters @xmath12 , where @xmath13 .",
    "the hi  column density distribution function @xmath14 is the most fundamental statistic for any hi  quasar absorption systems .",
    "it counts the number of columns in bins of [ @xmath15 per unit absorption distance @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 .",
    "the quantity @xmath19 can also be interpreted as an area covering fraction in the sky along the line element @xmath20 .",
    "examined @xmath14 in a series of cosmological sph simulations with different box sizes and resolution .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : column ] shows the results for runs with no wind and strong wind feedback , together with the observed data points.@xcite at high column densities ( @xmath21 ) , the agreement between the strong feedback run and observed data is quite good .",
    "the run with no wind feedback significantly overpredicts @xmath14 .",
    "this is because the galactic wind feedback reduces the number of columns with large @xmath22 by ejecting the gas from star - forming regions and heat the hi  gas .",
    "this agreement at @xmath23 for the strong feedback run is encouraging and shows the effectiveness of our current wind feedback model .",
    "one might speculate that the hi  in the overpredicted columns in the no feedback run could turn into molecular hydrogen , therefore the apparent disagreement between the simulation and the data points is not a serious problem .",
    "however , ref",
    ".   showed that the h@xmath24 column density distribution forms a natural extension to @xmath14 for local galaxies , and that the connection point between the two distribution is at @xmath25 .",
    "since the degree of overprediction in the no feedback run is more than a factor of 2 at @xmath26 , it seems difficult to hide all of the overpredicted hi  in the form of h@xmath24 if similar atomic and molecular physics hold in high-@xmath1  galaxies as in local galaxies .",
    "our simulations underpredict the number of columns with @xmath27 regardless of the strength of wind feedback .",
    "physical reasons for this underestimate is not clear at this point .",
    "several test runs show that this feature does not change very much with varying threshold density or time - scale for star formation , or varying wind feedback strength .",
    "any combination of the following could be the cause for this underestimate : inadequate resolution , angular momentum transfer problem , inadequate cooling due to lack of metal cooling in the current code , too simplistic models for star formation and sn feedback , or poor treatment of radiative transfer .",
    "we plan to address these issues in our future work .",
    "+      for a given observed path length @xmath28 , the hi  mass density within the survey volume can be estimated as follows ( in proper units ) : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the mass of a hydrogen atom , and @xmath31 $ ] is the observed range of @xmath22 . if the observed range of @xmath22 is broad enough and covers up to sufficiently high @xmath22 values , then one can expect that the calculated quantity is representative of the true value in the universe , and the mass density parameter of neutral gas can be estimated as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is inserted to take helium into account .",
    "it is known observationally@xcite that dlas dominate the hi  mass density at @xmath5 , with the amount roughly equal to half of the present - day stellar mass density .",
    "this suggests that dlas are important reservoirs of neutral gas for star formation in high-@xmath1  galaxies , and that the neutral gas in dlas at @xmath34 are converted into stars between @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    ".   showed that the observed estimates of @xmath36 can be bracketed by the simulation with no wind and strong wind feedback .",
    "it can also be shown that high-@xmath22 systems dominate @xmath37 , therefore it is important to include a fair number of high-@xmath22 systems in the sample to obtain an accurate fit to @xmath14 and estimate @xmath37 reliably .",
    "it is useful to quantify the cross section of dlas ( @xmath38 ) as a function of dark matter halo mass , because we have a theoretical framework to compute the halo mass function .",
    "@xcite observers can identify dlas only in the quasar sight - lines , but there could be multiple neutral gas clouds within the same halo that do not cross the quasar sight - line .",
    "therefore it is theoretically more plausible to characterize the occurrence of dlas as a cross section rather than the number of clouds in each halo .    ref .",
    "estimated the relationship between the total dla cross section @xmath39 ( in units of comoving @xmath40kpc@xmath41 ) and the dark matter halo mass ( in units of @xmath42 ) at @xmath34 as @xmath43 with slopes @xmath44 and normalization @xmath45 , depending on the numerical resolution and the strength of galactic wind feedback .",
    "the slope @xmath0 is always positive and massive halos have larger dla cross sections , but they are more scarce compared to less massive halos .",
    "two important features are : ( 1 ) as the strength of galactic wind feedback increases , the slope @xmath0 become steeper while the normalization @xmath46 remains roughly constant .",
    "this is because a stronger wind reduces the amount of neutral gas in low - mass halos at a higher rate by ejecting the gas out of the potential well of the halo .",
    "( 2 ) as the numerical resolution is improved , both the slope and the normalization increase .",
    "this is because with higher resolution , simulations can resolve higher densities , and star formation in low - mass halos can be described better . as a result the neutral gas content is decreased due to winds . on the other hand , a lower resolution run misses the early generation of halos and the neutral gas in them , resulting in lower @xmath37 at high-@xmath1 .",
    "earlier numerical work@xcite largely neglected the effects of star formation and wind feedback , therefore they often overestimated the dla cross sections in low - mass halos , resulting in higher value of predicted rate - of - incidence ( see   [ sec : rate ] ) . in order to match their results with observed data",
    ", they introduced a minimum halo mass that dlas populate .",
    "our simulations show that star formation and feedback affect the dla distribution , therefore , we need to study their effects further with better resolution and improved models of star formation and feedback .",
    "the probability of finding a dla for a given observed path - length can be expressed as a rate - of - incidence .",
    "theoretically , we can compute the cumulative rate - of - incidence of dlas per unit redshift above certain minimum halo mass @xmath47 as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the dark matter halo mass function and @xmath50 with @xmath51 for a flat universe . in order to carry out",
    "this integral , eq .  ( [ eq : sigma ] ) can be used .",
    "+    the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rate ] shows that the run with no wind feedback agrees with the observed rate if we sample the halos down to @xmath52 .",
    "the run with strong feedback underestimates the total dla rate - of - incidence by about 0.3 dex due to the underestimate of @xmath14 at @xmath53 .",
    "based on the results of hydro simulations , ref .",
    "derived the mean scaling relation between halo mass and galaxy @xmath54-band ab magnitude as @xmath55 where @xmath56 ( no feedback ) and @xmath57 ( strong feedback ) .",
    "this relation was used to convert the halo mass into apparent @xmath58 magnitude in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rate ] .",
    "the arrows in the figure indicate that the wind feedback reduces the contribution from low - mass halos to the dla rate - of - incidence .",
    "one can also calculate the differential probability distribution of dlas as a function of halo mass as @xmath59\\ , { \\sigma_{\\rm dla}^{co}}(m ) .",
    "\\label{eq : rate}\\ ] ] see ref .   for the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : abundance ] ) and ( [ eq : rate ] ) . since stronger wind feedback suppresses the contribution from low - mass halos to the total dla rate - of - incidence , the distribution shifts toward higher mass halos as the feedback strength is increased , and eventually a peak in the distribution appears at @xmath60 as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rate ] .",
    "this mass - scale is interesting , because recent observational studies@xcite of cross - correlation between dlas and lbgs suggested similar characteristic halo masses for dlas .",
    "ref .   also estimated the mean halo mass of dlas using numerical simulations ( see ref .   for a detailed comparison of our results with theirs . ) .      another important way to characterize",
    "the spatial distribution of dlas is to examine the distribution of impact parameter `` @xmath61 '' between dlas and the nearest galaxy . for a given dla sight - line in the simulation",
    ", we search for the nearest galaxy on the projected plane , and determine the @xmath61-parameter for each dla . as the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : impact ] shows , the @xmath61-parameter distribution is quite narrow in the current simulations , and over 80% of dlas have a galaxy within physical @xmath62 .",
    "this large fraction of dlas with small @xmath61-parameter is due to the large number of low - mass halos in a cdm universe and dlas associated with them . as the figs .",
    "@xmath63 in ref .",
    "show , dlas in lower mass halos are very compact with physical sizes of a few kpc , and coincide with star - forming regions very well .",
    "one might consider that this is plausible given the fact that the physical radii of lbgs are @xmath64kpc@xcite , however , dlas could also originate from extended hi  clouds observed as , e.g. , tidal tails of merging systems .",
    "we do not seem to have such extended dlas associated with low - mass halos in our current simulations .",
    "if we limit the search for nearby galaxies to those brighter than @xmath65mag , then the distribution becomes broader and roughly 80% of dlas have a galaxy within physical @xmath66 .",
    "if we increase the strength of galactic wind feedback , then we reduce the fraction of dlas in low - mass halos , and a larger fraction of dlas will be in more massive halos that are farther away , resulting in a broader @xmath61-parameter distribution .",
    "it is not clear at this point whether these conclusions from the current simulations are consistent with current observations given the limited sample.@xcite when a larger sample of dla host galaxies is constructed , the comparison will become more interesting .",
    "we can also constrain the spatial distribution of dlas using the cross - correlation function@xcite between dlas and galaxies .",
    "ref .   computed the cross correlation function using 211 lbgs and 11 dlas , and showed that there is a strong correlation between the two population , comparable to the lbg auto - correlation .",
    "this suggests that many dlas are physically related to lbgs and quite possibly in the same dark matter halos as lbgs .",
    "we will present the dla - lbg cross - correlation function in our simulations in the future .",
    "+      it would be useful to quantify the number density of dlas similarly to the galaxy number density .",
    "however doing so is not easy both observationally and in numerical simulations , because dla gas clouds are not detected in emission and they are often extended , connected , and exhibit very complicated morphologies as shown in fig .  1 of ref .  .",
    "theoretically , it is possible to calculate the mean number density of dla clouds as follows . assuming that the average physical covering area of each dla gas cloud is fixed with @xmath67 , then the cumulative number density of dlas above a certain halo mass @xmath47 is @xmath68 where @xmath49 is the dark matter halo mass function , and @xmath69 is the physical dla cross section as a function of halo mass .",
    "note that @xmath38 is the _ total _ dla cross section of each dark matter halo ; in other words , if there are 100 dla clouds in a massive halo , then this halo has a total dla cross section of @xmath70 .",
    "then , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : mag ] ) and ( [ eq : ndla ] ) , we calculate the cumulative comoving number density of dlas as a function of apparent @xmath58 magnitude @xmath71 as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : impact ] .",
    "this figure shows that the number density of dla clouds is higher than that of lbgs if their physical radius is smaller than @xmath72 .",
    "based on a similar calculation , ref",
    ".   suggested possible relationship between outflows from lbgs and dlas , although this idea is yet to be confirmed observationally .",
    "measurements of gas metallicity in dlas and galaxies provide useful information on star formation and chemical enrichment history .",
    "the mean metallicity of dlas is known@xcite to be @xmath73 , and that of lbgs to be @xmath74 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : metal ] , we show the distribution of gas metallicity as functions of @xmath22 and projected star formation rate @xmath75 for the two strong wind feedback runs ( q5 and g5 run ) at @xmath34 .",
    "the g5 run has a broader distribution than the q5 run because of a larger box size ( @xmath76 for the g5 and @xmath77 for the q5 run ) , but lower median metallicity at lower @xmath22 values due to lower resolution . in the left panel",
    ", we see that there are no observed dlas@xcite with @xmath78 and @xmath79 , while such sight - lines exist in our simulations .",
    "these columns with high @xmath22 and high metallicity are probably associated with central cores of lbgs that are actively forming stars .",
    "the occurrence of such columns are very rare as can be seen from the rapidly declining @xmath14 function , and they have very small cross - sections .",
    "there are other ideas to explain the absence of dlas at @xmath78 .",
    "one popular idea is the extinction of background quasars by dust@xcite .",
    "another idea is that the conversion of hi  to h@xmath24 molecule determines the maximum value of @xmath22.@xcite it is not fully clear at this point which of the above three explanations ( or any combinations of them ) is the correct one . at @xmath80 ,",
    "the q5 run might be overpredicting the median metallicity of dlas compared to observations .    the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : metal ] shows a similar distribution as the left panel .",
    "this is because @xmath75 and @xmath22 are correlated with each other strongly ( i.e. , @xmath81 , the kennicutt law@xcite ; see also fig .",
    "8 of ref .  ) , and metallicity also correlates with star formation positively .",
    "the metallicity for the columns with @xmath82 in the simulation might be slightly too high compared to the observational estimates of lbgs .",
    "the observational estimates by the cii@xmath83 technique@xcite ( blue data points ; only positive detections are shown ) nicely fall onto the simulated contour .",
    "the [ cii ]  emission line at @xmath84 m originates from the @xmath85 fine structure transition of c@xmath86 .",
    "this emission line is often the brightest emission in the spectrum of galaxies , and it is suggested to be the dominant coolant of diffuse ism at temperatures @xmath87 k.@xcite therefore , it has been suggested that the [ cii ]  emission is potentially another method for finding cold neutral gas in high-@xmath1  universe.@xcite    locally , [ cii ]  emission has been detected from both 1 ) dense star - forming gas irradiated by uv radiation from young stars@xcite and 2 ) extended , diffuse cold components of ism in quiescent late - type galaxies@xcite . at high-@xmath1 , there is only a few tentative detections@xcite of [ cii ]  emission from quasars at @xmath88 and @xmath89 , but none for more normal ( i.e. , not quasars or active galactic nuclei ) star - forming galaxies such as lbgs .",
    "detections of [ cii ]  emission from lbgs , drgs@xcite , and star - forming bzk@xcite galaxies might become possible in the near future by alma and spica",
    ".    we might be able to set important constraints on galaxy formation models using [ cii ]  detections .",
    "in particular interferometric maps of [ cii ]  emission would reveal the spatial dimensions of neutral gas that is responsible for dlas , a property that has so far eluded detection . by combining these measurements with the velocity widths of the [ cii ]  emission lines",
    ", it will be possible to infer the dark matter halo masses of the sources , and the [ cii ]  luminosity would tell us the heating rate of the gas .    ref",
    ".   attempted to make a realistic estimate of [ cii ]  emission from high-@xmath1  galaxies by coupling the analytic model of ref .   and",
    "cosmological hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "we first used the star formation rate and metallicity of gas in our simulations to estimate the amount of cold neutral medium ( cnm ; typically @xmath90k and @xmath91@xmath92 ) in each halo , and then computed the [ cii ]  luminosity by multiplying the [ cii ]  luminosity per hi  atom estimated by the analytic model to the cnm mass . as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cii ] , we find that the [ cii ]  luminosity can be described roughly by @xmath93 where @xmath94 ergs@xmath11 ( no wind ) and @xmath95ergs@xmath11 ( strong wind feedback ) . the strong wind feedback reduces the amount of cnm by ejecting the gas from star - forming regions , resulting in lower [ cii ]  luminosity by a factor of @xmath96 compared to the no feedback run .",
