    "the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ) is a network of interferometric detectors aiming to make direct observations of gravitational waves .",
    "construction of the ligo detectors is essentially complete , and much progress has been made in commissioning them to ( a ) bring the three interferometers to their final optical configuration , ( b ) reduce the interferometers noise floors and improve the stationarity of the noise , and ( c ) pave the way toward long - term science observations .",
    "interleaved with commissioning , four `` science runs '' have been carried out to collect data under stable operating conditions for astrophysical gravitational wave searches , albeit at reduced sensitivity and observation time relative to the ligo design goals .",
    "the first science run , called s1 , took place in the summer of 2002 over a period of 17 days .",
    "s1 represented a major milestone as the longest and most sensitive operation of broad - band interferometers _ in coincidence _ up to that time . using the s1 data from the ligo and geo600 interferometers  @xcite , astrophysical searches for four general categories of gravitational wave source types  binary inspiral  @xcite , burst - like  @xcite , stochastic  @xcite and continuous wave  @xcite  were pursued by the ligo scientific collaboration ( lsc ) .",
    "these searches established general methodologies to be followed and improved upon for the analysis of data from future runs . in 2003 two",
    "additional science runs of the ligo instruments collected data of improved sensitivity with respect to s1 , but still less sensitive than the instruments design goal .",
    "the second science run ( s2 ) collected data in early 2003 and the third science run ( s3 ) at the end of the same year .",
    "several searches have been completed or are underway using data from the s2 and s3 runs  @xcite .",
    "a fourth science run , s4 , took place at the beginning of 2005 .    in this paper",
    "we report the results of a search for gravitational wave bursts using the ligo s2 data .",
    "the astrophysical motivation for burst events is strong ; it embraces catastrophic phenomena in the universe with or without clear signatures in the electromagnetic spectrum like supernova explosions  @xcite , the merging of compact binary stars as they form a single black hole  @xcite and the astrophysical engines that power the gamma ray bursts  @xcite .",
    "perturbed or accreting black holes , neutron star oscillation modes and instabilities as well as cosmic string cusps and kinks  @xcite are also potential burst sources .",
    "the expected rate , strength and waveform morphology for such events is not generally known .",
    "for this reason , our assumptions for the expected signals are minimal .",
    "the experimental signatures on which this search focused can be described as burst signals of short duration ( @xmath3 1  second ) and with enough signal strength in the ligo sensitive band ( 1001100  hz ) to be detected in coincidence in all three ligo instruments .",
    "the triple coincidence requirement is used to reduce the false alarm rate ( background ) to much less than one event over the course of the run , so that even a single event candidate would have high statistical significance .",
    "the general methodology in pursuing this search follows the one we presented in the analysis of the s1 data  @xcite with some significant improvements . in the s1 analysis",
    "the ringing of the pre - filters limited our ability to perform tight time - coincidence between the triggers coming from the three ligo instruments .",
    "this is addressed by the use of a new search method that does not require strong pre - filtering .",
    "this new method also provides an improved event parameter estimation , including timing resolution .",
    "finally , a waveform consistency test is introduced for events that pass the time and frequency coincidence requirements in the three ligo detectors .",
    "this search examines 9.98 days of live time and yields one candidate event in coincidence among the three ligo detectors during s2 .",
    "subsequent examination of this event reveals an acoustic origin for the signal in the two hanford detectors , easily eliminated using a `` veto '' based on acoustic power in a microphone . taking this into account , we set an upper limit on the rate of burst events detectable by our detectors at the level of 0.26 per day at an estimated 90% confidence level",
    ". we have used _ ad hoc _ waveforms ( sine - gaussians and gaussians ) to establish the sensitivity of the s2 search pipeline and to interpret our upper limit as an excluded region in the space of signal rate versus strength . the burst search sensitivity in terms of the _ root - sum - square _ ( rss ) strain amplitude incident on earth lies in the range @xmath2  . both the upper limit",
    "( rate ) and its applicability to signal strengths ( sensitivity ) reflect significant improvements with respect to our s1 result  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we evaluate the sensitivity of the search to astrophysically motivated waveforms derived from models of stellar core collapse  @xcite and from the merger of binary black holes  @xcite .    in the following sections we describe the ligo instruments and the s2 run in more detail ( section  [ sec : ligos2run ] ) as well as an overview of the search pipeline ( section  [ sec : pipeline ] ) . the procedure for selecting the data that we analyze",
    "is described in section  [ sec : dataselect ] .",
    "we then present the search algorithm and the waveform consistency test used in the event selection ( section  [ sec : etg_methods ] ) and discuss the role of vetoes in this search ( section  [ sec : vetoes ] ) .",
    "section  [ sec : evana ] describes the final event analysis and the assignment of an upper limit on the rate of detectable bursts .",
    "the efficiency of the search for various target waveforms is presented in section  [ sec : efficiency ] .",
    "our final results and discussion are presented in sections  [ sec : results ] and  [ sec : summaries ] .",
    "ligo comprises three interferometers at two sites : an interferometer with 4  km long arms at the ligo livingston observatory in louisiana ( denoted l1 ) and interferometers with 4  km and 2  km long arms in a common vacuum system at the ligo hanford observatory in washington ( denoted h1 and h2 ) .",
    "all are michelson interferometers with power recycling and resonant cavities in the two arms to increase the storage time ( and consequently the phase shift ) for the light returning to the beam splitter due to motions of the end mirrors  @xcite .",
    "the mirrors are suspended as pendulums from vibration - isolated platforms to protect them from external noise sources .",
    "a detailed description of the ligo detectors as they were configured for the s1 run may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the ligo interferometers  @xcite are still undergoing commissioning and have not yet reached their final operating configuration and sensitivity . between s1 and s2 a number of changes were made which resulted in improved sensitivity as well as overall instrument stability and stationarity .",
    "the most important of these are summarized below .",
    "the mirrors analog suspension controller electronics on the h2 and l1 interferometers were replaced with digital controllers of the type installed on h1 before the s1 run .",
    "the addition of a separate dc bias supply for alignment relieved the range requirement of the suspensions coil drivers .",
    "this , combined with flexibility of a digital system capable of coordinated switching of analog and digital filters , enabled the new coil drivers to operate with much lower electronics output noise . in particular , the system had two separate modes of operation : acquisition mode with larger range and noise , and run mode with reduced range and noise . a matched pair of filters was used to minimize noise in the coil current due to the discrete steps in the digital to analog converter ( dac ) at the output of the digital suspension controller : a digital filter before the dac boosted the high - frequency component relative to the low - frequency component , and an analog filter after the dac restored their relative amplitudes .",
    "better filtering , better diagonalization of the drive to the coils to eliminate length - to - angle couplings and more flexible control / sequencing features also contributed to an overall performance improvement .    the noise from the optical lever servos that damp the angular excitations of the interferometer optics was reduced . the mechanical support elements for the optical transmitter and receiver",
    "were stiffened to reduce low frequency vibrational excitations .",
    "input noise to the servo due to the discrete steps in the analog to digital converter ( adc ) was reduced by a filter pair surrounding the adc : an analog filter to whiten the data going into the adc and a digital filter to restore it to its full dynamic range .",
    "further progress was made on commissioning the wavefront sensing ( wfs ) system for alignment control of the h1 interferometer .",
    "this system uses the main laser beam to sense the proper alignment for the suspended optics . during s1 , all interferometers had two degrees of freedom for the main interferometer ( plus four degrees of freedom for the mode cleaner ) controlled by their wfs .",
    "for s2 , the h1 interferometer had 8 out of 16 alignment degrees of freedom for the main interferometer under wfs control .",
    "as a result , it maintained a much more uniform operating point over the run than the other two interferometers , which continued to have only two degrees of freedom under wfs control .",
    "the high frequency sensitivity was increased by operating the interferometers with higher effective power .",
    "two main factors enabled this power increase .",
    "improved alignment techniques and better alignment stability ( due to the optical lever and wavefront sensor improvements described above ) reduced the amount of spurious light at the anti - symmetric port , which would have saturated the photodiode if the laser power had been increased in s1 .",
    "also , a new servo system to cancel the out - of - phase ( non - signal ) photocurrent in the anti - symmetric photodiode was added .",
    "this amplitude of the out - of - phase photocurrent is nominally zero for a perfectly aligned and matched interferometer , but various imperfections in the interferometer can lead to large low frequency signals .",
    "the new servo prevents these signals from causing saturations in the photodiode and its rf preamplifier . during s2 , the interferometers operated with about @xmath4  w incident on the mode cleaner and about @xmath5  w incident on the beam splitter .",
    "these changes led to a significant improvement in detector sensitivity .",
    "figure  [ fig : s2sens ] shows typical spectra achieved by the ligo interferometers during the s2 run compared with ligo s s1 and design sensitivity .",
    "the differences among the three ligo s2 spectra reflect differences in the operating parameters and hardware implementations of the three instruments , which were in various stages of reaching the final design configuration .",
    "the data analyzed in this paper were taken during ligo s second science run ( s2 ) , which spanned 59 days from february 14 to april 14 , 2003 . during this time",
    ", operators and scientific monitors worked to maintain continuous low noise operation of the ligo instruments .",
    "the duty cycles for the individual interferometers , defined as the fraction of the total run time when the interferometer was locked ( , all interferometer control servos operating in their linear regime ) and in its low noise configuration , were approximately 74% for h1 , 58% for h2 and 37% for l1 ; the triple coincidence duty cycle ( , the time during which all three interferometers were simultaneously in lock and in low - noise configuration ) was 22% . the longest continuous locked stretch for any interferometer during s2 was 66.2 hours for h1 .",
    "the main sources of lost time were high microseismic motion at both sites due to storms , and anthropogenic noise in the vicinity of the livingston observatory .    improved monitoring and automated alarms instituted after s1 gave the operators and scientific monitors better warnings of out - of - nominal operating conditions for the interferometers . as a result ,",
    "the fraction of time lost to high noise or to missing calibration lines ( both major sources of unanalyzable data during the s1 run ) was greatly reduced .",
    "thus , even though the s2 run was less than a factor of four longer than the s1 run and the duty cycle for triple interferometer coincidence was in fact marginally lower ( 23.4% for s1 vs. 22.0% for s2 ) , the total amount of _ analyzable _ triple coincidence data was 305 hours compared to 34 hours for s1 .",
    "the signature of a gravitational wave is a differential change in the lengths of the two interferometer arms relative to the nominal lengths established by the control system , @xmath6/l$ ] , where @xmath7 is the average length of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 arms . as in s1 ,",
    "this time series was derived from the error signal of the feedback loop used to differentially control the lengths of the interferometer arms in order to keep the optical cavities on resonance . to calibrate the error signal ,",
    "the effect of the feedback loop gain was measured and divided out .",
    "although more stable than during s1 , the response functions varied over the course of the s2 run due to drifts in the alignment of the optical elements .",
    "these were tracked by injecting fixed - amplitude sinusoidal signals ( calibration lines ) into the differential arm control loop , and monitoring the amplitudes of these signals at the measurement ( error ) point  @xcite .",
    "the s2 run also involved coincident running with the tama interferometer  @xcite .",
    "tama achieved a duty cycle of 81% and had a sensitivity comparable to ligo s above @xmath10  khz , but had poorer sensitivity at lower frequencies where the ligo detectors had their best sensitivity .",
    "in addition , the location and orientation of the tama detector differs substantially from the ligo detectors , which further reduced the chance of a coincident detection at low frequencies .",
    "for these reasons , the joint analysis of ligo and tama data focused on gravitational wave frequencies from 7002000  hz and will be described in a separate paper  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we report the result of a ligo - only search for signals in the range 1001100  hz . the overlap between these two searches ( 7001100  hz ) serves to ensure that possible sources with frequency content spanning the two searches will not be missed .",
    "the geo600 interferometer  @xcite , which collected data simultaneously with ligo during the s1 run , was undergoing commissioning at the time of the s2 run .",
    "the overall burst search pipeline used in the s2 analysis follows the one we introduced in our s1 search  @xcite .",
    "first , data selection criteria are applied in order to define periods when the instruments are well behaved and the recorded data can be used for science searches ( section  [ sec : dataselect ] ) .    a wavelet - based algorithm called waveburst  @xcite ( section  [ sec : etg_methods ] ) is then used to identify candidate burst events . rather than operating on the data from a single interferometer , waveburst analyzes simultaneously the time series coming from a pair of interferometers and incorporates strength thresholding as well as time and frequency coincidence to identify transients with consistent features in the two data streams . to reduce the false alarm rate",
    ", we further require that candidate gravitational wave events occur effectively simultaneously in all three ligo detectors ( section  [ ss : triplecoinc ] ) .",
    "besides requiring compatible waveburst event parameters , this involves a waveform consistency test , the @xmath11-statistic  @xcite ( section  [ sec : rstat ] ) , which is based on forming the normalized linear correlation of the raw time series coming from the ligo instruments .",
    "this test takes advantage of the fact that the arms of the interferometers at the two ligo sites are nearly co - aligned , and therefore a gravitational wave generally will produce correlated time series .",
    "the use of waveburst and the @xmath11-statistic are the major changes in the s2 pipeline with respect to the pipeline used for s1  @xcite .",
    "when candidate burst events are identified , they can be checked against veto conditions based on the many auxiliary read - back channels of the servo control systems and physical environment monitoring channels that are recorded in the ligo data stream ( section  [ sec : vetoes ] ) .",
    "the background in this search is measured by artificially shifting in time the raw time series of one of the ligo instruments , l1 , and repeating the analysis as for the un - shifted data .",
    "the time - shifted case will often be referred to as `` time - lag '' data and the unshifted case as `` zero - lag '' data .",
    "we will describe the background estimation in more detail in section  [ sec : evana ] .",
    "we have relied on hardware and software signal `` injections '' in order to establish the efficiency of the pipeline . simulated signals with various morphologies  @xcite were added to the digitized raw data time series at the beginning of our analysis pipeline and were used to establish the fraction of detected events as a function of their strength ( section  [ sec : efficiency ] ) .",
    "the same analysis pipeline was used to analyze raw ( zero - lag ) , time - lag , and injection data samples .",
    "we maintain a detailed list with a number of checks to perform for any zero - lag event(s ) surviving the analysis pipeline to evaluate whether they could plausibly be gravitational wave bursts .",
    "this `` detection check - list '' is updated as we learn more about the instruments and refine our methodology .",
    "a major aspect is the examination of environmental and auxiliary interferometric channels in order to identify terrestrial disturbances that might produce a candidate event through some coupling mechanism .",
    "any remaining events are compared with the background and the experiment s live time in order to establish a detection or an upper limit on the rate of burst events .",
    "the selection of data to be analyzed was a key first step in this search .",
    "we expect a gravitational wave to appear in all three ligo instruments , although in some cases it may be at or below the level of the noise . for this search ,",
    "we _ require _ a signal above the noise baseline in all three instruments in order to suppress the rate of noise fluctuations that may fake astrophysical burst events . in the case of a genuine astrophysical event",
    "this requirement will not only increase our detection confidence but it will also allow us to extract in the best possible way the signal and source parameters . therefore , for this search we have confined ourselves to periods of time when all three ligo interferometers were simultaneously locked in low noise mode with nominal operating parameters ( nominal servo loop gains , nominal filter settings , etc . ) , marked by a manually set bit ( `` science mode '' ) in the data stream .",
    "this produced a total of 318 hours of potential data for analysis .",
    "this total was reduced by the following data selection cuts :    * a minimum duration of 300 seconds was required for a triple coincidence segment to be analyzed for this search .",
    "this cut eliminated @xmath12% of the initial data set . * post - run re - examination of the interferometer configuration and status channels included in the data stream identified a small amount of time when the interferometer configuration deviated from nominal .",
    "in addition we identified short periods of time when the timing system for the data acquisition had lost synchronization .",
    "these cuts reduced the data set by @xmath13% . *",
    "it was discovered that large low frequency excitations of the interferometer could cause the photodiode at the anti - symmetric port to saturate .",
    "this caused bursts of excess noise due to nonlinear up - conversion .",
    "these periods of time were identified and eliminated , reducing the data set by 0.3% .",
    "* there were occasional periods of time when the calibration lines either were absent or were significantly weaker than normal .",
    "eliminating these periods reduced the data set by approximately 2% .",
    "* the h1 interferometer had a known problem with a marginally stable servo loop , which occasionally led to higher than normal noise in the error signal for the differential arm length ( the channel used in this search for gravitational waves ) .",
    "a data cut was imposed to eliminate periods of time when the rms noise in the 200400  hz band of this channel exceeded a threshold value for 5 consecutive minutes .",
    "the requirement for 5 consecutive minutes was imposed to prevent a short burst of gravitational waves ( the object of this search ) from triggering this cut .",
    "this cut reduced the data set by 0.4% .",
    "these data quality cuts eliminated a total of 13 hours from the original 318 hours of triple coincidence data , leaving a `` live - time '' of 305 hours .",
    "the fraction of data surviving these quality cuts ( 96% ) is a significant improvement over the experience in s1 when only 37% of the data passed all the quality cuts .    the trigger generation software used in this search ( to be described in the next section ) processed data in fixed 2-minute time intervals , requiring good data quality for the entire interval .",
    "this constraint , along with other constraints imposed by other trigger generation methods which were initially used to define a common data set , led to a net loss of 41 hours , leaving 264 hours of triple coincidence data actually searched .",
    "the search for bursts in the ligo s2 data used roughly 10% of the triple coincidence data set in order to tune the pipeline ( as described below ) and establish event selection criteria .",
    "this data set was chosen uniformly across the acquisition time and constituted the so - called `` playground '' for the search .",
    "the rate bound calculated in sec .",
    "[ sec : evana ] reflects only the remaining @xmath1490% of the data , in order to avoid bias from the tuning procedures .",
    "an accurate knowledge of gravitational wave burst waveforms would allow the use of _ matched filtering _",
    "@xcite along the lines of the search for binary inspirals  @xcite . however , many different astrophysical systems may give rise to gravitational wave bursts , and the physics of these systems is often very complicated .",
    "even when numerical relativistic calculations have been carried out , as in the case of core collapse supernovae , they generally yield roughly representative waveforms rather than exact predictions .",
    "therefore , our present searches for gravitational wave bursts use general algorithms which are sensitive to a wide range of potential signals .",
    "the first ligo burst search  @xcite used two event trigger generator ( etg ) algorithms : a time - domain method designed to detect a large `` slope '' ( time derivative ) in the data stream after suitable filtering  @xcite , and a method called tfclusters  @xcite which is based on identifying clusters of excess power in time - frequency spectrograms .",
    "several other burst - search methods have been developed by members of the ligo scientific collaboration .",
    "for this paper , we have chosen to focus on a single etg called waveburst which identifies clusters of excess power once the signal is decomposed in the wavelet domain , as described below .",
    "other methods which were applied to the s2 data include tfclusters ; the excess power statistic of anderson _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ; and the `` block - normal '' time - domain algorithm  @xcite . in preliminary studies using s2 playground data , these other methods had sensitivities comparable to waveburst for the target waveforms described in section  [ sec : efficiency ] , but their implementations were less mature at the time of this analysis .    an integral part of our s2 search and the final event trigger selection is to perform a consistency test among the data streams recorded by the different interferometers at each trigger time identified by the etg .",
    "this is done using the @xmath11-statistic  @xcite , a time - domain cross - correlation method sensitive to the coherent part of the candidate signals , described in subsection c below .",
    "waveburst is an etg that searches for gravitational wave bursts in the wavelet time - frequency domain .",
    "it is described in greater detail in  @xcite .",
    "the method uses wavelet transformations in order to obtain the time - frequency representation of the data .",
    "bursts are identified by searching for regions in the wavelet time - frequency domain with an excess of power , coincident between two or more interferometers , that is inconsistent with stationary detector noise .",
    "waveburst processes gravitational wave data from two interferometers at a time . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pipeline ] the analysis is performed over three ligo detectors resulting in the production of triggers for three detector pairs .",
    "the three sets of triggers are then compared in a `` triple coincidence '' step which checks for consistent trigger times and frequency components , as will be described in section  [ ss : triplecoinc ] .        for each detector pair",
    ", the waveburst etg performs the following steps : ( a ) wavelet transformation applied to the gravitational wave channel from each detector , ( b ) selection of wavelet amplitudes exceeding a threshold , ( c ) identification of common wavelet components in the two channels , ( d ) clustering of nearby wavelet components , and ( e ) selection of burst triggers . during steps ( a ) , ( b ) and ( d ) the data processing is independent for each channel . during steps ( c ) and ( e ) data from both channels are used .",
    "the input data to the waveburst etg are time series from the gravitational wave channel with duration of @xmath15 seconds and sampling rate of @xmath16  hz .",
    "before the wavelet transformation is applied the data are downsampled by a factor of two . using an orthogonal wavelet transformation ( based on a symlet wavelet with filter length of 60 ) the time series",
    "are converted into wavelet series @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the time index and @xmath19 is the wavelet layer index .",
    "each wavelet layer can be associated with a certain frequency band of the initial time series .",
    "the time - frequency resolution of the waveburst scalograms is the same for all the wavelet layers ( @xmath20  sec @xmath21  hz ) .",
    "therefore , the wavelet series @xmath17 can be displayed as a time - frequency scalogram consisting of 64 wavelet layers with @xmath22 pixels ( data samples ) each .",
    "this tiling is different from the one in the conventional dyadic wavelet decomposition where the time resolution adjusts to the scale ( frequency )  @xcite .",
    "the constant time - frequency resolution makes the waveburst scalograms similar to spectrograms produced with windowed fourier transformations .    for each layer we first select a fixed fraction @xmath23 of pixels with the largest absolute amplitudes .",
    "these are called _",
    "black pixels_. the number of selected black pixels is @xmath24 .",
    "all other wavelet pixels are called _",
    "white pixels_. then we calculate rank statistics for the black pixels within each layer .",
    "the rank @xmath25 is an integer number from 1 to @xmath24 , with the rank 1 assigned to the pixel with the largest absolute amplitude in the layer .",
    "given the rank of wavelet amplitudes @xmath25 , the following non - parametric pixel statistic is computed @xmath26 for white pixels the value of @xmath27 is set to zero . the statistic @xmath27 can be interpreted as the pixel s _",
    "logarithmic significance_. assuming gaussian detector noise , the logarithmic significance can be also calculated as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the absolute value of the pixel amplitude in units of the noise standard deviation . in practice ,",
    "the ligo detector noise is not gaussian and its probability distribution function is not determined _ a priori_. therefore , we use the non - parametric statistic @xmath27 , which is a more robust measure of the pixel significance than @xmath30 . using the inverse function of @xmath31 with @xmath27 as an argument",
    ", we introduce the _ non - parametric amplitude _ @xmath32 and the _ excess power ratio _",
    "@xmath33 which characterizes the pixel excess power above the average detector noise .",
    "after the black pixels are selected , we require their time - coincidence in the two channels . given a black pixel of significance @xmath27 in the first channel , this is accepted if the significance of neighboring ( in time ) pixels in the second channel ( @xmath34 ) satisfies @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the _ coincidence threshold_. otherwise , the pixel is rejected .",
    "this procedure is repeated for all the black pixels in the first channel .",
    "the same coincidence algorithm is applied to pixels in the second channel . as a result",
    ", a considerable number of black pixels in both channels produced by fluctuations of the detector noise are rejected . at the same time",
    ", black pixels produced by gravitational wave bursts have a high acceptance probability because of the coherent excess of power in two detectors .",
    "after the coincidence procedure is applied to both channels a clustering algorithm is applied jointly to the two channel pixel maps . as a first step ,",
    "we merge ( or ) the black pixels from both channels into one time - frequency plane . for each black pixel",
    "we define neighbors ( either black or white ) , which share a side or a vertex with the black pixel .",
    "the white neighbors are called _ halo _ pixels .",
    "we define a cluster as a group of black and halo pixels which are connected either by a side or a vertex .",
    "after the cluster reconstruction , we go back to the original time - frequency planes and calculate the cluster parameters separately for each channel . therefore , there are always two clusters , one per channel , which form a waveburst trigger .",
    "the cluster parameters are calculated using black pixels only .",
    "for example , the cluster size @xmath37 is defined as the number of black pixels .",
    "other parameters which characterize the cluster strength are the cluster excess power ratio @xmath38 and the cluster _ logarithmic likelihood _ @xmath39 . given a cluster @xmath40 ,",
    "these are estimated by summing over the black pixels in the cluster : @xmath41 given the times @xmath42 of individual pixels , the cluster center time is calculated as @xmath43 as configured for this analysis , waveburst initially generated triggers with frequency content between 64  hz and 4096  hz . as we will see below , the cluster size , likelihood , and excess power ratio can be used for the further selection of triggers , while the cluster time and frequency span are used in a coincidence requirement . the frequency band of interest for this analysis , 1001100  hz , is selected during the later stages of the analysis .",
    "there are two main waveburst tunable input parameters : the black pixel fraction @xmath23 which is applied to each frequency layer , and the coincidence threshold @xmath36 .",
    "the purpose of these parameters is to control the average black pixel occupancy @xmath44 , the fraction of black pixels over the entire time - frequency scalogram . to ensure robust cluster reconstruction",
    ", the occupancy should not be greater than @xmath45% .",
    "for white gaussian detector noise the functional form of @xmath44 can be calculated analytically .",
    "this can be used to set a constraint on @xmath23 and @xmath36 for a given target @xmath44 .",
    "if @xmath23 is set too small ( less then a few percent ) , noise outliers due to instrumental glitches may monopolize the limited number of available black pixels and thus allow gravitational wave signals to remain hidden . to avoid this domination of instrumental glitches",
    ", we run the analysis with @xmath23 equal to 10% .",
    "this value of @xmath23 together with the occupancy target @xmath44 of 0.7% defines the coincidence threshold @xmath36 at 1.5 .",
    "all the tuning of the waveburst method was performed on the s2 playground data set ( section  [ sec : dataselect ] ) .",
    "for the selected values of @xmath23 and @xmath36 , the average trigger rate per ligo instrument pair was approximately @xmath46  hz , about twice the false alarm rate expected for white gaussian detector noise .",
    "the trigger rate was further reduced by imposing cuts on the excess power ratio @xmath38 . for clusters of size",
    "@xmath37 greater than @xmath45 we required @xmath38 to be greater than @xmath47 while for single pixel clusters ( @xmath48 ) we used a more restrictive cut of @xmath38 greater than @xmath49 .",
    "this selection on the event parameters further reduced the counting rates per ligo instrument pair to @xmath50  hz .",
    "the times and reconstructed parameters of waveburst events passing these criteria were written onto disk .",
    "this allowed the further processing and selection of these events without the need to re - analyze the full data stream , a process which is generally time and cpu intensive .",
    "further selection of waveburst events proceeds by identifying triple coincidences .",
    "the output of the waveburst etg is a set of coincident triggers for a selected interferometer pair @xmath51 .",
    "each waveburst trigger consists of two clusters , one in @xmath52 and one in @xmath53 .",
    "for the three ligo interferometers there are three possible pairs : ( l1,h1 ) , ( h1,h2 ) and ( h2,l1 ) . in order to establish triple coincidence events ,",

    "an average frequency is then calculated from the clusters , weighted by signal - to - noise ratio , and the coincident event candidate is kept for this analysis if this average frequency is above 64  hz and below 1100  hz .",
    "the final step in the coincidence analysis of the waveburst events involves the construction of a single measure of their combined significance . as we described already , triple coincidence events consist of three waveburst triggers involving a total of six clusters .",
    "each cluster has its parameters calculated on a per - interferometer basis .",
    "assuming white detector noise , the variable @xmath39 for a cluster of size @xmath37 follows a gamma probability distribution .",
    "this motivates the use of the following measure of the _ cluster significance _ : @xmath68 which is derived from the logarithmic likelihood @xmath39 of a cluster @xmath40 and from the number @xmath37 of black pixels in that cluster  @xcite .",
    "given the significance of the six clusters , we compute the _ combined significance _ of the triple coincidence event as @xmath69 where @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) is the significance of the @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) cluster for the @xmath63 interferometer pair .    in order to evaluate the rate of accidental coincidences , we have repeated the above analysis on the data after introducing an unphysical time shift ( `` lag '' ) in the livingston data stream relative to the hanford data streams .",
    "the hanford data streams are not shifted relative to one another , so any noise correlations from the local environment are preserved .",

    "this is because an astrophysical signal can produce either a correlation or an anticorrelation in the interferometers at the two ligo sites , depending on its sky position and polarization .",
    "in fact , the @xmath11-statistic analysis was done using whitened ( see below ) but otherwise uncalibrated data , with an arbitrary sign convention .",

    "each data stream is first band - pass filtered with an 8th - order butterworth filter with corner frequencies of 100  hz and 1572  hz , then down - sampled to a 4096  hz sampling rate .",
    "the upper frequency of 1572  hz was chosen in order to have 20  db suppression at 2048  hz and thus avoid aliasing . the lower frequency of 100  hz",
    "was chosen to suppress the contribution of seismic noise ; it also defines the lower edge of the frequency band for this gravitational wave burst search , since it is above the lower frequency limit of 64  hz for waveburst triggers .",
    "the band - passed data are then whitened with a linear predictor error filter with a 10  hz resolution trained on a 10  second period before the event start time .",
    "the filter removes predictable content , including lines that were stationary over a 10  second time scale .",
    "it also has the effect of suppressing frequency bands with large stationary noise , thus emphasizing transients  @xcite .",
    "the next step in the @xmath11-statistic analysis involves the construction of all the possible @xmath11 coefficients given the number of interferometer pairs involved in the trigger , their possible relative time - delays due to their geographic separation , and the various integration times being considered .",

    "future analyses will restrict the time delay to a much smaller value when correlating data from the two hanford interferometers , to allow only for time calibration uncertainties .",

    "if these are statistically consistent at the 95% level , then the algorithm assigns no significance to any apparent correlation in this detector pair .",
    "otherwise , a one - sided significance and its associated logarithmic confidence are calculated from the _ maximum _ value of @xmath93 for any time delay , compared to what would be expected if there were no correlation .",

    "although this waveform morphology has significant signal power in the narrow frequency band ( 895930  hz ) of sensitivity for most of the igec detectors , it actually fails to maintain an approximately flat fourier spectrum over the broader range ( 694930  hz ) needed in order to encompass all of them .",
    "for this reason , in order to perform the same comparison in s2 we have used the gaussian of @xmath86=0.1  ms signal morphology which was the closest waveform with a flat spectrum in the 694930  hz range that we included in our s2 simulations .",
    "the igec analysis  @xcite set an upper limit of @xmath110 events / day at the 95% confidence level on the rate of gravitational wave bursts .",
    "the limit was derived assuming optimal source direction and polarization and was also given as a function of the burst fourier amplitude in a rate versus strength exclusion curve similar to ligo s .",
    "using ligo s s2 gaussian of @xmath86=0.1  ms simulations , the waveburst etg efficiency for sources with random linear polarizations is 50% at a strength of @xmath111  ( see table  [ tbl : adhoc ] ) .",
    "for the same sources all with _ optimal _ polarizations , the 50% efficiency point improves by roughly a factor of 3 , to @xmath112  .",
    "thus the optimally oriented rate versus strength curve looks similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : gsg_exclude ] , but shifted to the left . substituting the 95% confidence level ( cl ) event limit of @xmath113 for the 90% cl event limit of @xmath104 shifts the curve up .",
    "lastly , the igec excluded region from fig .  13 of  @xcite can be translated from bars natural units ( hz@xmath114 ) to units of @xmath101 ( ) .",
    "given the fourier transform h(f ) for a gaussian waveform h(t ) , @xmath115 @xmath116 we convert the igec values of spectral amplitude h(f ) into @xmath101 for a gaussian of @xmath86=0.1  ms signal morphology ( the conversion is a function of the assumed frequency of the igec result and may vary by a few percent over the 694930  hz range . ) the resulting comparison can be seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : ligovsigec ] .",
    "exclusion curves at the 95% confidence level for optimally oriented gaussians of @xmath86=0.1  ms .",
    "the solid curve displays the 95% confidence level measurement obtained by ligo with this search .",
    "the igec exclusion region is shown shaded and it is adapted from fig .  13 of  @xcite .",
    "if the comparison were performed using q=8.9 , 849  hz sine - gaussians , the ligo and igec curves would move to smaller amplitudes by factors of 1.1 and @xmath143 , respectively . ]    with ligo and s2 we are able to stretch the excluded region substantially to the left ( , to weaker signals ) of the boundary of the excluded region in the rate versus strength curve of fig .",
    "13 in  @xcite .",
    "however , although s2 s increased observing time allows a lower rate limit than could be set in s1 , it is still the case that the igec longer duration search allows substantially better rate limits to be set , for signals strong enough for its detectors to have seen them .",
    "furthermore , we are interested in a comparison with the results reported from the analysis of the explorer and nautilus 2001 data . in their 2002 paper  @xcite the rome group that analyzes the data of and operates these two resonant mass detectors reported a slight excess of events seen in sidereal hours between 3 and 5 . the events seen in concidence by the two detectors are of an average temperature of approximately 120mk which according to the authors corresponds to an optimally oriented gravitational wave burst fourier amplitude of @xmath117hz@xmath114 ( equation 4 from ref .",
    "the rate of such events is of order 200 events / year ( or 0.55 events / day )  @xcite . given the amplitude of the observed events by the resonant mass detectors , the corresponding @xmath101 of the hypothetical events in our ligo instruments will generally depend on the signal morphology . as with our aforementioned igec analysis , we considered the case of a gaussian of @xmath86=0.1  ms , for which the fourier amplitude of the observed events at the detectors average resonance frequency implies an @xmath101 of @xmath118  . keeping in mind that the suggested @xmath101 values refer to optimal orientation",
    ", we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : ligovsigec ] that for this event strength the ligo s2 search set an upper bound to their flux at roughly @xmath119 events per day at the 95% cl .",
    "it should be noted , though , that depending on the assumptions of signal waveform ( for example a single cycle of a 914  hz sinusoid or a narrow - band sine - gaussian signal centered on the same frequency ) or considering the range of event strengths recorded by explorer and nautilus ( rather than their average value only ) the corresponding @xmath101 at the ligo detectors may come nearer to the threshold of our sensitivity and thus make our rate limits poorer .",
    "the signal strength and rate of the 2001 rome results come with enough uncertainties that given the ligo s2 sensitivity and exposure we can not make a definitive comparison .",
    "the significant improvements in sensitivity and longer observation times that we expect in new ligo searches in the near future will enable us to move in this direction .",
    "the search for gravitational wave bursts in ligo s s2 run has seen significant improvements introduced in the search methodology and interpretation with respect to s1 .",
    "this included the introduction of the waveform consistency cut and the use of astrophysically motivated waveforms as part of the search interpretation .",
    "additional improvements are currently under way .",
    "we expect them to bring stronger suppression of the background via the use of a burst amplitude consistency test between the ligo detectors as well as new ways of performing our event analysis within the context of a distributional analysis of their strength .",
    "moreover , we plan to make use of data taking periods corresponding to the double coincidence of the instruments that are not part of the triple coincidence dataset .",
    "we will continue investigating the optimization of search algorithms for specific types of waveforms and adding stronger astrophysical context in our search by invoking source population models or targeting plausible point sources . among the lessons learned in the s2 search",
    "has been the importance of the follow - up investigations dictated by coincident triggers revealed by the pipeline .",
    "as expected , with the detector performance nearing design sensitivity , potential couplings from the environment and the instrument itself will become apparent and will need to be identified and vetoed out .",
    "our on - going work for vetoes will become more prominent together with the need to define rigorous criteria and procedures for following up on such events .",
    "ligo s subsequent runs have already collected data of comparable duration and improved sensitivity with respect to s2 and they will present the next milestone of the search for bursts where a good number of these improvements will be exercised .",
