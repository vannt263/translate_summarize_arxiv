    "in their classic 1935 paper , erds and szekeres @xcite proved that , for every integer @xmath5 , there is a minimal integer @xmath0 , such that any set of @xmath0 points in the plane in general position contains @xmath1 points in convex position , that is , they are the vertices of a convex @xmath1-gon .",
    "erds and szekeres gave two proofs of the existence of @xmath0 .",
    "their first proof used a quantitative version of ramsey s theorem , which gave a very poor upper bound for @xmath0 .",
    "the second proof was more geometric and showed that @xmath6 ( see theorem [ cupscaps ] in the next section ) .",
    "on the other hand , they showed that @xmath3 and conjectured this to be sharp  @xcite .",
    "small improvements have been made on the upper bound @xmath7 by various researchers @xcite , but no improvement in the order of magnitude has ever been made .",

    "in this section , we recall several results that will be used in the proof of theorem [ main ] .",

    "a transitive 2-coloring of the triples of @xmath20 is a 2-coloring , say with colors red and blue , such that , for @xmath21 , if triples @xmath22 and @xmath23 are red ( blue ) , then @xmath24 and @xmath25 are also red ( blue ) .",

    "then    @xmath27    the next theorem is due to pr and valtr @xcite , and is often referred to as the positive - fraction erds - szekeres theorem ( see also @xcite ) . given a @xmath13-cap ( @xmath13-cup ) @xmath28 , where the points appear in order from left to right , we define the _ support of _ @xmath12 to be the collection of open regions @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the region outside of @xmath31 bounded by the segment @xmath32 and by the lines @xmath33 , @xmath34 ( where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , etc . ) .",

    "the proof now falls into two cases .    _",
    "case 1_. suppose there are @xmath75 parts @xmath67 in the collection @xmath76 , such that no two of them are in adjacent regions , and each such part contains a subset @xmath77 of size at least @xmath74 such that @xmath77 is an antichain with respect to @xmath68 .",
    "let @xmath78 be the selected subsets .    for each @xmath79 , @xmath80 , the line spanned by any two points in @xmath79 does not intersect the segment @xmath81 , and therefore , does not intersect region @xmath82 for @xmath83 ( by the non - adjacency property ) .",
    "since @xmath1 is sufficiently large , we have @xmath84 , and therefore    @xmath85    theorem [ cupscaps ] implies that @xmath79 contains either an @xmath1-cup or a @xmath86-cap .",
    "if we are in the former case for any @xmath87 , then we are done .",
    "therefore we can assume @xmath79 contains a subset @xmath88 that is a @xmath86-cap , for all @xmath89 .",
    "we claim that @xmath90 is a cap , and therefore @xmath91 is in convex position .",
    "let @xmath92 .",
    "since @xmath93 , there is a point @xmath94 such that the line @xmath15 supported by the segment @xmath95 has the property that all of the other points in @xmath88 lie below @xmath15 . since @xmath15 does not intersect @xmath81 , all of the points in @xmath96 must lie below @xmath15 .",
    "hence , @xmath91 is a cap and    @xmath97    _ case 2_. suppose we are not in case 1 .",
    "then there are @xmath98 consecutive indices @xmath99 such that each such part @xmath100 contains a subset @xmath101 such that @xmath101 is a chain of length at least @xmath102 with respect to @xmath68 . for simplicity",

    "consider the subset @xmath77 inside the region @xmath30 , and order the elements in @xmath104 with respect to @xmath68 .",
    "we say that @xmath105 is a _",
    "right - cap _ if @xmath106 is in convex position , and we say that @xmath107 is a _ left - cap _ if @xmath108 is in convex position . notice that left - caps and right - caps correspond to the standard notion of cups and caps after applying an appropriate rotation to the plane so that the segment @xmath32 is vertical . since @xmath77 is a chain with respect to @xmath68 , every triple in @xmath77 is either a left - cap or a right - cap , but not both .",
    "moreover , for @xmath21 , if @xmath109 and @xmath110 are right - caps ( left - caps ) , then @xmath111 and @xmath112 are both right - caps ( left - caps ) . by theorem  [ comcupcap ] , if @xmath113 , then @xmath77 contains either a @xmath13-left - cap or an @xmath18-right - cap .",
    "we make the following observation .    [ glue ]",
    "consider the ( adjacent ) sets @xmath114 and @xmath115 . if @xmath114 contains a @xmath13-left - cap @xmath116 , and @xmath115 contains an @xmath18-right - cap @xmath117 , then @xmath118 forms @xmath119 points in convex position .    by lemma",

    "if all four points lie in @xmath120 , then they are in convex position . likewise if they all lie in @xmath121 , they are in convex position .",

    "we have for @xmath139 ,    @xmath140    set @xmath141 . since @xmath1 is sufficiently large , we have @xmath142 which implies that @xmath143 either contains an @xmath1-right - cap , or a @xmath144-left - cap . in the former case",
    "we are done , so we can assume that @xmath143 contains a @xmath144-left - cap .",
    "likewise , @xmath145 , which implies @xmath146 contains either an @xmath147-right - cap , or a @xmath148-left - cap . in the former case we are done since observation [ glue ] implies that the @xmath144-left - cap in @xmath143 and the @xmath147-right - cap in @xmath146 form @xmath1 points in convex position .",
    "therefore we can assume @xmath146 contains a @xmath148-left - cap .    in general ,",
    "if we know that @xmath114 contains an @xmath149-left - cap , then we can conclude that @xmath77 contains an @xmath150-left - cap .",
    "indeed , for all @xmath151 we have    @xmath152    since @xmath1 is sufficiently large , ( [ p1 ] ) and ( [ p2 ] ) imply that    @xmath153    therefore , @xmath77 contains either an @xmath154-right - cap or an @xmath150-left - cap . in the former case",
