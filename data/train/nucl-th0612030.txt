    "<S> we have investigated theoretically the system size- and the centrality dependence of the hbt radius parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 at rhic energies . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that the calculations are well in line with experimental data , except that the predicted @xmath1 values in central collisions ( besides the elementary p+p collisions ) are slightly larger than the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the @xmath6 ratio is larger than that extracted from data . </S>",

    "<S> furthermore , in this energy region , recently the rapidity dependence of the hbt - radii of the pion source was investigated systematically by two experimental collaborations na49 @xcite and ceres @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that the rapidity ( or pseudorapidity ) dependence of the hbt parameters might provide essential information on the localization of hot and dense nuclear matter and hence it is worthwhile to investigate theoretically .    by using the ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd , v2.2 ) transport model ( employing hadronic and string degrees of freedom ) ( for details , the reader is referred to refs . </S>",

    "<S> the three - dimensional correlation function is fit with the standard gaussian form :    @xmath8    in which @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the components of the pair momentum difference @xmath11 and the homogeneity length ( the hbt - radii ) in the @xmath12 direction , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath13 parameter is the incoherence factor which lies for bose - einstein statistics between 0 ( complete coherence ) and 1 ( complete incoherence ) . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , the @xmath13 parameter is affected by many factors e.g. non - pionic contaminations , ( long - lived ) resonances , and details of the coulomb correction . </S>",
    "<S> theoretically , the @xmath13 parameter is mainly suppressed by the presence of mediate / long - lived resonances since pions from the decay of these resonances come from a larger source than the directly emitted pions , which results in an overall suppression of the correlation function . </S>",

    "<S> the difference between na49 and ceres data is obviously not due to the differently charged pion species since , similar to the hbt results at rhic @xcite , we also find that the difference between the hbt - radii of two positively charged and two negatively charged pions is quite small at sps energies . </S>",

    "<S> is seen at small @xmath21 with the increase of beam energy . </S>",

    "<S> keep in mind that the two ways of particle production are different : the former is based on the quasi - particle level ( with respect to the resonance masses @xmath58 gev ) , while the latter happens at large two - particle center - of - mass energies ( @xmath59 gev ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the string process dominates at the early stage of hics with large beam energies . while the decay of resonance takes place over the whole evolution of the system . in order to understand the dissimilar rapidity - dependence of @xmath0 at large beam energies , we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig6 ] the single - pion rapidity ( @xmath60 ) ) distribution of the ratio of the pion numbers at freeze - out from the decay of resonances and strings . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we see that the mean ratios have exceeded unit which means the decay of resonances dominates at freeze - out and is also of importance to the hbt parameters . in this figure </S>",
    "<S> we also find an interesting beam - energy dependence of the ratio as a function of rapidity , e.g. , at @xmath14a gev , it first drops from mid - rapidity to projectile - target rapidity region and then rises further with increasing rapidity . </S>",
    "<S> while at the largest energy point of sps , @xmath20a gev , the ratio at mid - rapidity is suppressed due that much more pions produced by string fragmentation are treated to transversely emit with small longitudinal velocity . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the case when more pions emitted via the decay of resonance leads to the postpone of pion freeze - out and hence extend the volume of source . while larger fraction of pions via the decay of strings means the freeze - out takes place at earlier stage of overall process and hence a smaller volume of source . </S>",

    "<S> it is seen clearly that the cross term increases with the increase of rapidity which is expected since the longitudinally boost - invariance is broken in the forward and backward rapidity regions @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> one should notice that the largest deviation of the calculated hbt radii from experimental data comes from the pion correlation at mid - rapidities in the most central collisions , where the interactions are strongest . </S>",
    "<S> owing to the omission of treatment on string - string interactions in urqmd at early stage , one can argue that the pressure in the early stage might be too small , resulting in a delayed source break - up . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( in central collisions at @xmath20a gev ) we show the hbt radii with a zero formation time of particles as well . due to the reduced mean - free - path of partons and hence much larger transverse pressure at early stage , the @xmath21 fall - off of the hbt - radii is seen even stronger than that found in the data which implies stronger coordinate - momentum correlation in the modified calculations . </S>",
