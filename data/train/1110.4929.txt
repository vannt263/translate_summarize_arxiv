    "random geometric network models  @xcite comprise a collection of entities called nodes embedded in region of typically two or three dimensions , together with connecting links between pairs of nodes that exist with a probability related to the node locations .",
    "they appear in numerous complex systems including in nanoscience  @xcite , epidemiology  @xcite , forest fires  @xcite , social networks  @xcite , and wireless communications  @xcite . such networks exhibit a general phenomenon called _ percolation _",
    "@xcite , where at a critical connection probability ( controlled by the node density ) , the largest connected component ( cluster ) of the network jumps abruptly from being independent of system size ( microscopic ) to being proportional to system size ( macroscopic ) .",
    "percolation phenomena are closely related to thermodynamic phase transitions where the number of nodes @xmath0 goes to infinity and the critical percolation density @xmath1 is largely independent of the system size , shape , and of the microscopic details of the model ; the phenomenon of universality . at the critical point ,",
    "conformal invariance in two dimensional networks leads to detailed expressions for the probability of a connection across general regions  @xcite and more general connections with conformal field theory  @xcite and schramm - loewner evolution  @xcite . here",
    ", we take a different approach and are concerned with finite networks and with questions related to percolation , but fundamentally different : what node density ensures a specified probability @xmath2 that the entire network is a single connected component ( cluster ) , that is , _ fully connected _ ?",
    "how is this probability affected by the shape of the network domain ?",
    "these questions are crucial for many applications , including for example the design of reliable wireless mesh networks . these consist of communication devices ( the nodes ) that pass messages to each other via other nodes rather than a central router .",
    "this allows the network to operate seamlessly over a large area , even when nodes are moved or deactivated .",
    "a fully connected network means that every node can communicate with every other node through direct or indirect connections .",
    "mesh networks have been developed for many communication systems , including laptops , power distribution ( `` smart grid '' ) technologies , vehicles for road safety or environmental monitoring , and robots in hazardous locations such as factories , mines and disaster areas  @xcite .",
    "for many applications of random geometric networks including those above , _ direct connection _ between two nodes @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be well described by a probability @xmath5 , a given function of the distance between the nodes @xmath6 . often , the nodes are mobile or otherwise not located in advance , hence we assume @xmath0 uniformly distributed nodes confined in a specified @xmath7-dimensional region @xmath8 with area ( @xmath9 ) or volume ( @xmath10 ) denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "the node density is then defined as @xmath12 . for reference",
    ", we will later take @xmath13 $ ] , where @xmath14 is a relevant length scale , and @xmath15 determines the sharpness of the cut - off .",
    "note that when @xmath16 a step function corresponding to the popular _ unit disk _ deterministic model  @xcite is obtained , where connections have a fixed range @xmath17 .",
    "our derivation however is completely general and only requires that @xmath18 is sufficiently short - ranged compared to system size . using this as a basis",
    ", we find that contrary to common belief and practice , the geometrical details of the confined space boundaries ( _ corners , edges _ and _ faces _ ) dominate the properties of the percolation transition .",
    "moreover , the short - range nature of @xmath18 allows us to separate individual boundary components and obtain analytic expressions for @xmath2 at high densities as a sum over their contributions .",
    "we confirm this through computer simulations and argue that the substantial improvement offered by our main result eq .",
    "[ e : bdy ] can be used to predict , control , optimize or even set benchmarks for achieving full network connectivity in a wide variety of suitable models and applications involving finite size geometries .",
    "isolated nodes shown as black balls concentrate at the boundaries of the domain and particularly near corners at higher densities .",
    "nodes are placed randomly in a cube , with lighter colors indicating a higher probability of being in the largest connected component .",
    "we use @xmath19 , while the side length of the cube is @xmath20 .",
    "there are 500 nodes in ( a ) and 700 nodes in ( b ) . ]",
    "as in conventional continuum percolation theory  @xcite , we start by utilizing a cluster expansion approach  @xcite to derive a systematic perturbative method for determining the full connection probability @xmath2 as a function of density @xmath21 . formulation of the expansion can be summarized as follows .",
    "the probability of two nodes being connected ( or not ) leads to the trivial identity @xmath22 . multiplying over all links expresses the probabilities @xmath23 of all @xmath24 possible graphs @xmath25 , @xmath26\\equiv \\sum_{g}\\mathcal{h}_{g},\\ ] ] collecting terms according to largest cluster size we get @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the set of all possible graphs with largest cluster of size @xmath29 .",
    "the first term on the right hand side is the probability of being fully connected given a specific configuration of nodes .",
    "the average over all random configurations @xmath30 of this quantity is thus the overall probability of obtaining a fully connected network @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , the main idea conveyed by eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) is that at high densities , full connectivity is most likely to be broken by a single isolated node ( the @xmath31 term ) ; this is sufficient detail for most applications .",
    "further corrections incorporate the probability of several isolated single nodes and smaller clusters of nodes , for which a systematic expansion can be developed  @xcite .",
    "averaging eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) over all configurations and noting that to leading order the @xmath32 cluster is fully connected , and that all nodes are identical , the first order approximation becomes @xmath33 where the `` connectivity mass '' accessible from a node placed at @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 assuming that the volume @xmath36 for any @xmath34 , which is reasonable if the system is significantly larger than @xmath14 at moderate densities and that the number of nodes @xmath0 is large , eq.[first ] simplifies to @xmath37 this equation is equivalent to eq .",
    "( 8) in mao and anderson  @xcite which was derived for the specific case of a square domain .",
    "following numerous studies by probabilists and engineers  @xcite , these authors however assumed an exponential scaling of system size @xmath11 with @xmath21 which essentially renders boundary effects negligible . scaling",
    "the system in such a way is a common approach as it corresponds to the limit of infinite density at fixed connection probability , however in practice this limit is approached only for unphysically large volumes . in contrast , we do not assume exponential growth of @xmath11 , and also consider far more general geometries in any dimension @xmath38 .    without an exponentially growing volume @xmath11 ,",
    "the behavior of the full connection probability at high densities is qualitatively different : it is controlled by the exponential in eq .",
    "( [ e : ma ] ) , and hence node positions @xmath34 where the connectivity mass is small , that is , near the boundary of @xmath8 .",
    "thus in contrast to the usual situation in statistical mechanics , the boundaries ( and in particular corners ) are important , and we will see they in fact dominate . we illustrate this in fig .  [",
    "f : balls ] where nodes are placed randomly inside a cube and an average over a large number of possible graphs gives the connectivity of each node .",
    "notice that isolated and hard - to - connect nodes shown as dark balls concentrate near the boundaries of the domain and particularly near corners at higher densities .",
    "this observation forms the basis of our work , and has led to a radically different understanding of connectivity in confined geometries which we now detail further .",
    "the contributions to the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ e : ma ] ) come from @xmath34 at _ boundary components _ @xmath39 of dimension @xmath40 , for example the bulk , the faces , and right angled edges and corners of a cube , with @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "the short - range nature of @xmath18 allows us to isolate each boundary component , whilst to leading order the connectivity mass splits into independent radial and angular integrals , depending only on the local geometry of @xmath43 and hence @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the angle ( @xmath9 ) or solid angle ( @xmath10 ) subtended by @xmath43 .",
    "for example , if @xmath46 is near a corner of the cube then @xmath47 , while near an edge @xmath48 , near faces @xmath49 and @xmath50 for the bulk interior . hence , from eq .",
    "( [ e : ma ] ) we see that corner contributions to @xmath2 as a function of @xmath21 are exponentially larger than edge contributions which are themselves exponentially larger than face contributions etc .",
    "this simple argument shows that the dominant contribution to @xmath2 at high densities comes from the `` pointiest '' corners .    expanding @xmath51 about @xmath52 near the corresponding boundary component we obtain a next to leading order expansion for @xmath53 which we can then use to approximately evaluate the integral in eq .",
    "( [ e : ma ] ) . ignoring exponentially smaller correction terms and combining all boundary contributions we arrive at our main result @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the @xmath40-dimensional `` volume '' of each component ( equal to one in the case of a @xmath42-dimensional corner and @xmath11 when @xmath56 ) , @xmath57 is a geometrical factor depending on @xmath43 and implicitly on @xmath58 and @xmath59 is as in ( [ e : sgf ] ) ; see examples below . notice that eq .",
    "( [ e : bdy ] ) is completely general as we have only assumed a short - ranged @xmath18 and not used its specific form .",
    "moreover , it also does not depend on using euclidean distance and holds in any dimension @xmath60 and geometry where the lack of connectivity is dominated by a situation involving an @xmath32 cluster and a single disconnected node .",
    "hence eq .",
    "( [ e : bdy ] ) is a powerful and useful multi - purpose tool for analyzing full network connectivity at high densities in a wide variety of suitable models and applications involving finite size geometries .",
    "for example , in the context of single input single output ( siso ) wireless communication channels and a rayleigh fading model @xcite , information theory predicts @xmath61 $ ] with @xmath15 an environment and wavelength dependent decay parameter equal to @xmath62 for free propagation , increasing to @xmath63 for a cluttered environment , while @xmath14 depends on the minimum outage rate threshold . for nodes confined to a cube of side length @xmath64 and @xmath19",
    "we find @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 with contributions from each of the eight corners , twelve edges , six faces and bulk .",
    "however the derivation is general : once @xmath57 and @xmath59 have been evaluated for these boundary components ( right angled edges etc . ) by standard asymptotic analysis of the relevant integrals , they apply to any geometry with these features and length scales significantly larger than @xmath17 .",
    "this independence on the large scale geometry follows from the short - range nature of @xmath18 and is a type of universality allowing for the calculation of @xmath2 in complex high dimensional geometries without increased difficulty .",
    "( a ) comparison of the full analytic prediction of eq .",
    "( [ e : bdy ] ) ( solid curve ) with direct numerical simulation of the random network in a cube of side length @xmath68 ( jagged curve )",
    ". the dashed line corresponds to the bulk contribution ( previous theory ) .",
    "( b ) contributions from the bulk ( dotted blue , left ) , faces ( red ) , edges ( yellow ) and corners ( green , right ) , together with the total ( solid blue ) and numerical simulation ( black jagged curve ) , showing the dominance of the corners at the highest densities and good agreement between theory and simulation at moderate to high densities . here",
    "it is convenient to plot the outage probability @xmath69 . ]",
    "the substantial improvement offered by eq .",

    "[ f : cube]b ) further demonstrates the inaccuracy of the bulk model as well as the benefits of including boundary effects when analyzing network connectivity in confined geometries .     corner contributions in triangles with equal area and perimeter : comparison of theory with direct simulation , as in fig .",
    "[ f : cube ] .",
    "the red triangle has side lengths of 26.88 , 15.44 and 15.44 in units of the connectivity length scale @xmath17 , while the blue triangle has side lengths of 8.40 , 24.68 and 24.68 .",
    "the black dashed lines correspond to the equal bulk ( left curve ) and bulk@xmath70edge ( right curve ) contributions while neglecting corner contributions .",
    "the colored curves give the total ( including crucial corner ) contributions for each triangle . both theory and simulation",
    "are plotted , showing excellent agreement with the numerical simulations ( jagged curves ) which cover them completely for @xmath71 . ]",
    "we can go beyond simple geometries restricted to right - angled corners .",
    "consider the case of a two dimensional triangle with general angles @xmath72 .",
    "the relevant integrals for this case come to @xmath73 , with @xmath74 for the corners and @xmath75 for the edges and bulk and can be generalized easily to higher dimensions .",
    "[ f : tri ] shows two triangles chosen to have identical perimeter and area ; the connectivity at a given density differs only due to the corner angles and agrees perfectly with the full theory of eq .",
    "( [ e : bdy ] ) .",
    "a bulk theory , even supplemented with edge contributions , is clearly incapable of explaining the difference between the connectivities of networks in these two triangles .",
    "moreover , such a situation motivates inverse problems , similar to  hearing the shape of a drum \" @xcite by attempting to determine the size and shape details of an unknown domain containing a random network .",
    "an important aspect of the theory presented here is how it affects the design of real life random geometric networks . for wireless mesh networks ,",
    "the lack of connectivity near the boundaries can be mitigated by increasing the signal power , the number of spatial channels , or by constructing a hybrid network with a regular array of fixed nodes along the boundaries as well as randomly placed nodes in the interior . in each of these cases , the design can now be analyzed given information about the cost and connectivity function @xmath76 and of course the desired connectivity region .",
    "conversely , boundary effects can be harnessed to avoid full connectivity if desired .",
    "for example in the case of forest fires @xcite we have a prediction for the number of unburnt regions as a function of the geometric landscape and environment parameters ( for example angles between fire - lanes and/or natural boundaries ) , again given a specific model for connectivity that depends on the type of vegetation , temperature , moisture content etc .",
    "similar models could be devised for the spread of epidemics @xcite or mobile phone viruses @xcite where boundaries are embedded in a more complex ( possibly non - euclidean ) space yet @xmath18 is still short - ranged .",
    "we examined connectivity in confined geometries and illustrated the importance of the often neglected boundary effects .",
    "we then derived a general high density expansion eq .",
    "( [ e : bdy ] ) for the probability of full connectivity @xmath2 assuming only a short - ranged connectivity function relative to system size and showed that it displays universal features allowing for its easy calculation in complex geometries .",
    "this we have confirmed through computer simulations and argued that our approach is well placed to facilitate efficiency in design in a variety of physical applications ranging from wireless networks to forest fire - lanes .",
    "appropriate modifications of our theory can aid the understanding of small boundary - dominated systems such as for example the electrical conduction through carbon nanotubes in a polymer matrix  @xcite but possibly larger systems such as highly connected social and financial networks  @xcite .",
