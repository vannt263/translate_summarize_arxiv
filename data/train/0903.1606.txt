    "the region around @xmath6 and @xmath7 has drawn considerable interest in nuclear - structure research since the observation in @xmath8ni of a @xmath9 level as the first excited state @xcite and the high excitation energy of the first excited @xmath10 level @xcite .",
    "both properties were regarded as strong indications for the double - magic character of @xmath8ni . however , despite all the additional information that was acquired over the last decade , the specific role of the @xmath7 subshell closure and the @xmath6 closure on the structure of nuclei around @xmath8ni is not yet understood . especially the occurrence of single - particle and collective phenomena close to @xmath8ni deserves further attention .",
    "therefore , this region remains challenging from both an experimental and a theoretical perspective .",
    "most early studies were aimed at the structure of the more easily produced nickel and copper isotopes using in - beam @xmath11-ray studies @xcite , @xmath4-decay investigations @xcite , and ( d,@xmath12he ) pickup reactions @xcite .",
    "recently , more exotic nuclei with @xmath13 have provided experimental information providing a more direct connection with single - particle and collective configurations , e.g. , g - factor measurements of @xmath14cu and @xmath15ni @xcite and transition probabilities from coulomb excitation experiments in @xmath8ni @xcite and @xmath16cu @xcite .",
    "these results provide complementary , but often also unanticipated and crucial insights , such as the admixture of @xmath17 excitations across @xmath6 in @xmath15ni @xcite , the superfluid character of @xmath8ni @xcite and the collectivity present in @xmath18cu @xcite .",
    "while experiments on the nickel and copper isotopes are currently experiencing a new boost , information on the cobalt isotopes around and beyond @xmath7 remains scarce . on the other hand",
    ", the levels of the lighter odd - mass cobalt isotopes up through @xmath19co appear to be readily described by treating the observed structures as resulting from a single @xmath20 proton - hole coupled to the adjacent even - even nickel cores @xcite .    until recently , the known experimental observables for the heavier cobalt nuclei near @xmath8ni were isomeric @xmath11 decay in @xmath21co @xcite , a @xmath22-kev @xmath11 transition in @xmath5co @xcite and ground state half - life values determined in @xmath23co @xmath4 decay @xcite .",
    "@xmath1co is the heaviest odd - mass cobalt isotope for which , prior to this work , a level scheme was proposed @xcite , albeit one that could not be interpreted .",
    "the @xmath1co level scheme presented in the present paper results from a study of @xmath1fe @xmath4 decay , as well as of deep - inelastic data that were initially dedicated to the yrast structure of @xmath3fe @xcite . also , the study of the subsequent @xmath1co @xmath4 decay turned out to be crucial to establish the @xmath1co structure . in previous @xmath4-decay work",
    "@xcite , the @xmath24 ground state of @xmath1co was reported to directly @xmath4 feed the @xmath25 state at @xmath26  kev , which remained an unsolved issue .",
    "in addition to the @xmath1fe-@xmath1co decay study presented here , the @xmath4 decay of @xmath5fe was studied in the same experimental campaign and revealed a @xmath27 isomer at @xmath28  kev in @xmath5co @xcite .",
    "while in ref .",
    "@xcite the isomer was discussed , the present paper is focussing on a detailed description and discussion of the full @xmath5fe decay scheme .",
    "there are also theoretical issues .",
    "strong monopole interactions @xcite are present between the @xmath20 orbital and the @xmath29 , @xmath30 and , according to refs .",
    "@xcite , even the @xmath31 orbitals .",
    "however , the interactions are not precisely known and , moreover , they currently can not all be included simultaneously in the same valence space .",
    "nevertheless , the first excited levels in copper and nickel isotopes are generally described in fair agreement with experiment by large - scale shell - model calculations @xcite using appropriate effective interactions based on the g matrix @xcite and modified further with a monopole correction @xcite .",
    "experimental spectroscopic - factor values of the first excited @xmath32 state in the copper chain determined up to @xmath33 , are , however , significantly larger than the calculated values @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy illustrates the deficiency in either the interactions used or in the restricted valence space .",
    "unfortunately , even more demanding calculations are required when the @xmath20 orbital is active ; i.e. , for cobalt nuclei and other @xmath34 nuclei . with the hitherto limited valence space and current realistic interactions ,",
    "large - scale shell model calculations are not yet available for a consistent description of these nuclei .",
    "the isotopes that are studied in this paper , @xmath0co , provide important information on the effective interactions in the cobalt isotopes adjacent to @xmath8ni .",
    "consequently , they also form a good testing ground for the potential magic character of the @xmath8ni core .",
    "the isotopes form a bridge between the spherical nickel isotopes and the region of deformation below @xmath6 that is observed to set in gradually in excited states of @xmath21fe @xcite and is proposed for the @xmath3cr ground state @xcite . because the onset of deformation below @xmath6 is understood only qualitatively , it is not clear a priori how the cobalt isotopes are behaving , since the deformation mechanism depends critically on the values of the @xmath7 and @xmath35 gaps @xcite .",
    "it is known that the @xmath7 subshell closure is already weak in @xmath8ni ( @xmath36 mev ) @xcite and decreases further in @xmath5co ( @xmath37 mev ) @xcite , although the error bar is large in the latter case . under the influence of the tensor interaction between protons in the @xmath20 orbital and neutrons in the @xmath29 and @xmath30 orbitals @xcite",
    ", the closure is expected to decrease even further for the @xmath7 isotones with lower z. the @xmath35 energy shell gap in @xmath38ni is not experimentally determined yet , but the systematics of the @xmath35 isotones with @xmath39 indicate the persistence of this gap towards nickel @xcite .",
    "nuclear structure of the cobalt isotopes was until recently known up to @xmath40 and the structure of all of the nuclei can be interpreted as originating from a @xmath41 proton hole coupled to its adjacent nickel neighbor . moreover , the dominant low - energy structure of @xmath42ni and @xmath43cu can be explained as due to a coupling with excited levels of the @xmath8ni core @xcite .",
    "it came , therefore , as a surprise that the first excited level in @xmath5co arises from excitations across @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the complementarity of the @xmath4-decay and deep - inelastic experiments allows to interpret the @xmath1co structure .",

    "<S> the neutron - rich isotopes @xmath0fe and @xmath1co have been produced at the lisol facility , louvain - la - neuve , in the proton - induced fission of @xmath2u . </S>",
    "<S> beams of these isotopes have been extracted with high selectivity by means of resonant laser ionization combined with mass separation . </S>",
    "<S> yrast and near - yrast levels of @xmath1co have also been populated in the @xmath3ni+@xmath2u reaction at argonne national laboratory . </S>",
    "<S> the level structure of @xmath1co could be investigated by combining all the information from both the @xmath1fe and @xmath1co @xmath4 decay and the deep - inelastic reaction . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1fe , @xmath1co and @xmath5fe decay schemes and the @xmath1co yrast structure are fully established . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0co level structures can be interpreted as resulting from the coexistence of core - coupled states with levels based on a low - energy proton - intruder configuration . </S>"
