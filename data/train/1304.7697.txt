    "pulsar b1918 + 19 is a typical ` slow ' radio pulsar with a stellar - rotation period ( @xmath0 ) of 0.82 s and a spin - down age of 15 myr .",
    "it was one of three apparently conal pulsars with three - peaked profiles whose pulse - sequence ( hereafter ps ) behaviour was studied at 430 mhz by hankins & wolszczan ( 1987 ; henceforth hw ) .",
    "these authors identified four distinct modes of emission labelled a , b , c , and n  a nomenclature that will also be used here for continuity .",
    "the first three modes exhibited drifting subpulses which , together with the fourth `` disordered '' mode and embedded null sequences , were found to interact in specific sequences .    in this paper",
    "we exploit the improved signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of our observations to analyse this pulsar s drift modulation and nulls more thoroughly .",
    "a full statistical assessment is given for each mode and type of modal sequence .",
    "recent studies of other similar pulsars have found that nulling is sometimes confined to a specific mode of emission ( redman  2005 ) or found to have a periodic nature ( rankin & wright 2007 ; herfindal & rankin 2007 , 2009 ) and we establish here to what degree this is true of b1918 + 19 .    to place our results in a physical , or at least geometric , framework , we consider the context of a rotating subbeam - carousel system ( rs ) .",
    "this has often proved successful in describing drifting subpulses in conal pulsars ( , deshpande & rankin 1999 , 2001 ; hereafter dr ; battacharyya  2007 ) , and it is now interesting to explore whether the more complex multiple discrete mode patterns of b1918 + 19 together with their ` sequence rules ' can be made compatible with such a model .    in  2",
    "we describe our observations , and in  3 we present what can be inferred about the pulsar s basic emission geometry from its profile and polarization . ",
    "4 introduces the multiple features in its fluctuation spectra , and  5 discusses the profiles and phase patterns of the several modes .  6 gives an analysis of nulling statistics , and  7 discusses mode sequencing and transitions . in  8",
    "we discuss the possibility of aliasing , and  9 provides an interpretation of the pulsar s three drift modes in terms of the rotating carousel - beam model , and this is checked against the observationally - derived geometry of the pulsar in  10 .",
    " 11 summarises the results and  12 draws conclusions .",
    "the observations were carried out using the 305-meter arecibo telescope in puerto rico .",
    "all of the observations used the upgraded instrument with its gregorian feed system , 327-mhz ( p band ) or 1400-mhz ( l band ) receivers , and wideband arecibo pulsar processors ( wappwapp ] ) .",
    "the acfs and ccfs of the channel voltages produced by receivers connected to orthogonal linearly ( circularly , after 2004 october 11 at p band ) polarized feeds were 3-level sampled .",
    "upon fourier transforming , some 64 or more channels were synthesized across a 25-mhz bandpass with about a milliperiod sampling time .",
    "each of the stokes parameters was corrected for interstellar faraday rotation , various instrumental polarization effects , and dispersion .",
    "the date , resolution , and the length of the observations are listed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    ".band , resolution , and length of arecibo observations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table3 ]    @xmath2 values can also be estimated from the hrf spectra , and we computed an hrf with the longitude restricted to the central component ( not shown ) .",
    "this did not seem to significantly affect the three features corresponding to the drift modes .",
    "however , taking the hrf of the relatively long c mode ps ( figure  [ fig10 ] ) we can see that the primary modulation is associated with the fourier component peaking at about 20 ( its harmonic very clearly peaks about component 40 ) ; therefore , @xmath2 here is very near 360/20 or 18  or 41 ms ( 34@xmath32 ms in hw ) .",
    "we found it difficult to measure the a- and b - mode @xmath2 values by this method , and the problem is discernible in fig .",
    "the harmonic numbers carrying the b and a modes are clearly smaller as can be judged from their harmonics , but the peaks themselves are too broadened and conflated to give any reliable estimate .",
    "the above @xmath2 values are given in table 3 , and we can use these values for each mode , together with the inferred geometry of the pulsar with respect to us , to compute what kind of carousel subbeam system underlies them .",
    "starting with the profile geometry in  3 above , it is of importance here is that the deduced @xmath4 and @xmath5 values square with the central ppa rate @xmath6 [ @xmath7 of 3.2/. the circumstance that this pulsar has an inside ( poleward ) sightline traverse ( as does b0943 + 10 ) is also quite clear from the profile geometry and linear character of the star s ppa traverse .",
    "the point is that @xmath2 subtends a particular magnetic polar longitude @xmath8 , which in turn can be used to estimate the subbeam number .",
    "dr give such a relation as their eq .",
    "( 3 ) , but gupta s eq . ( 6 ) is more accurate because it distinguishes the conal edges from the subbeam path within the cone .",
    "we used a version of this relation @xmath9 where the subbeam path @xmath8 is 0.8  interior to the outside conal half power point . note that this value closely reflects the difference between the outer half - power and peak conal radii in the models of et vi and gil & sendyk ( 2000 )",
    "therefore , in our case , @xmath5 is negative , so the peak subbeam track has a magnetic polar colatitude of @xmath10 or 3.4 .",
    "then , the subbeam number @xmath11 can be estimated as 360/@xmath11 .",
    "these simple computations are assembled in table 3 , where it can be confirmed that the derived subbeam numbers are near integral and are fully compatible with the integers 10 , 9 and 7 for the a , b and c configurations respectively in table 2 . as a check",
    ", one can also carry out these computations for a positive ( equatorward ) sightline geometry , and the resultng @xmath8 values are roughly twice as large , implying a very small number of subbeams , demonstrating that this sightline would be incorrect .",
    "in 1987 hankins & wolszczan carried out the first analysis of the properties of b1918 + 19 , attracted by its entirely conal triple profile and the added opportunities this configuration presents to investigate the relationships of emission in its inner and outer cones . using arecibo pss they were able to identify the four basic single - pulse modes of emission ( a , b , c and n ) and noted specific cyclic relationships between these modes .    here ,",
    "with the advantage of more recent data from the same telescope but at a slightly lower observing frequency , we explore the geometry of the pulsar and refine and add to the known single pulse repetition patterns .",
    "further , we propose a possible carousel configuration present at the polar cap which may explain the mode changes with a simple idea . before discussing this model in the next section ,",
    "it is useful to summarise our observational results :    * b1918 + 19 has integrated properties common to many pulsars : it has a conal triple ( ct ) profile with very nearly the usual angular dimensions for its inner and outer cones  half - power conal radii @xmath12 at 1-ghz of 4.1 and 6.5as computed originally in et vi .",
    "its integrated polarisation properties suggest that the magnetic latitude @xmath4 and sightline impact angle @xmath5 are some 13.7 and 4.2 , respectively , such that its inside ( poleward ) sightline traverse cuts its inner cone tangentially ( @xmath13 ) and outer cone obliquely ( @xmath14 ) * the profile exhibits leading / trailing asymmetry of two types : the leading ( outer ) conal component is much stronger than the trailing one ; and the leading part of the main ( inner cone ) component is stronger than the trailing part .",
    "this asymmetry is least marked in the n mode , and becomes stronger in the a and b as well as the c mode  wherein trailing portions of the profile nearly vanishes .",
    "* as hw found , the star s pulse sequences exhibit three highly discrete drifting modes , a , b and c , as well as a non - drifting n mode , however , the pulsar exhibits _ five _ prominent fluctuation features , three corresponding to the a , b and c drift modes with @xmath15 values near 6.0 , 4.0 and 2.5 @xmath0 , and two null - related features at about 12 and 85 @xmath0 . * about 9% of the pulses are `` nulls '' but these nulls are distributed in a highly non - random manner , evidenced by the substantial fraction of nulls with long ( 2 - 10 pulse ) durations .",
    "the a and c modes seem not to null , and the b mode infrequently , so the nulls occur mainly within the n mode at a roughly 43% fraction . *",
    "fluctuations in the inner - cone main and outer - cone leading components are phase - locked in all three modes  and with very similar phase relationships .",
    "this suggests that the drift features , a , b and c , may be seen as consisting of a similar pattern across both inner and outer cones spun past our sightline at three different speeds , or as a widening pattern at a common speed .",
    "the phase - locking is very reminiscent of the double - cone model proposed for b081841 by bhattacharyya   ( 2007 ) , and has been argued for b1237 + 25 ( srostlik & rankin 2005 ) , b083624 ( gupta  2004 , esamdin  2005 ) and b1039 - 19 ( bhattacharyya  2011 ) . finding this same property in b1918 + 19 mode - by - mode suggests that locking between inner and outer cones is a common , maybe ubiquitous , feature in double - cone pulsars with regular drift .",
    "for b1918 + 19 the classic carousel model of ruderman & sutherland ( 1975 ) predicts a circulation time @xmath16 of 8.5 @xmath0 , well below what would be expected if the observed @xmath15 values were interpreted directly as measures of spark - to - spark transition speeds . with a more subtle model involving a central discharge ( gil & sendyk 2000 )",
    "it may well be possible to achieve a more plausible circulation speed , but it remains hard to understand why the circulation time switches between three fixed but very different values in this and other pulsars ( see , for example , discussion of the quantised drift patterns of b2319 + 60 in wright & fowler 1981 ) .",
    "here we have explored the view that the observed driftbands result from first - order aliasing of a much faster drift .",
    "this is what the original carousel model ( assuming any reasonable number of  sparks `` ) would actually _ predict _ , since our sampling rate ( @xmath0 ) is comparable to the frequency ( @xmath17 ) with which the ' ' sparks \" are presented to us .",
    "this is not the first time subpulse drift has been ascribed to aliasing ( , dr , janssen & van leeuwen 2004 , gupta  2004 , bhattacharya  2007 ) , but here we extend the idea to account for the presence of quantised drift rates and their sequence .",
    "using our observations we are able to _ deduce _ that aliasing requires 10 , 9 and 7 subbeams corresponding to the a , b and c modes and , more surprisingly , that these are all consistent with a common circulation time of about 12 @xmath0 , not far from the original rs figure .",
    "this essentially mathematical - geometric picture appears to be compatible with the observed @xmath2 values , which increase gradually as @xmath15 falls , as the model requires ( see table 2 ) .",
    "thus we no longer need to explain a changing circulation time , and can understand the changing  quantised  drift rates as a progressive reduction in the number of sparks .",
    "this is physically much easier to understand .",
    "it is significant that the n mode is also clearly linked to the circulation time .",
    "the n mode was not involved in the deduction of a , b and c s common @xmath16 , and yet its repetition rate @xmath18  discovered here  is virtually the same as @xmath16 .",
    "so what does this mode represent ?",
    "we demonstrate in  9 that the mode can betray the underlying circulation time by firstly ending the mode cycle through the vanishing subbeams with wide angular separations , and then by re - starting the mode cycle through the aliasing of 11 subbeams .",
    "thus the mode sees the regeneration of the mode cycle and must be the phase in that cycle when the subbeams re - establish themselves .",
    "one may speculate whether carousel configurations with varying numbers of subbeams might explain the multiple different drift modes exhibited by other pulsars .",
    "the best - known examples , b003107 ( huguenin  1970 ; vivekanand & joshi 1997 ) , b2319 + 60 ( wright & fowler 1981 ) , b2303 + 30 ( redman  2005 ) and b1944 + 17 ( deich  1986 , kloumann & rankin 2010 ) , have similar ratios in their @xmath15 values to those of b1918 + 19 and are worthy of further investigation in the context of aliased drift .    however , as is evident in the sequences of fig",
    ". 2 and as noted above , the drift rates of b1918 + 19 are not totally steady in the a and b modes and at the transition can initially overshoot their new value .",
    "this suggests that the circulation time is not held rigidly steady as supposed in the basic calculations here .",
    "pulsars b2016 + 28 , b081841 and b082634 all intermittently display curved driftbands , so changes in pulsar drift patterns can not always be explained by the sudden disappearance of a subbeam .",
    "the point we make in this paper is that subtle variations in the circulation time and in the number of circulating beams can , if the sampling rate of once per pulse period is infrequent for probing the true circulation time , generate the extraordinarily dramatic and spectacular effects seen in the pulse sequences of many pulsars .",
