    "a primary goal of the sdss imaging survey is to scan 8500 deg@xmath1 of the north galactic cap ( hereafter referred to as the sdss main survey ) .",
    "in addition to the main survey , sdss also conducts a deep survey by repeatedly imaging a 300 deg@xmath1 area on the celestial equator in the south galactic cap in the fall ( hereafter referred to as the sdss deep survey ; * ? ? ? * ) . this deep stripe ( also called stripe 82 ) spans @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",

    "@xcite have used the deep data to find low - redshift faint quasars selected from the sdss coadded catalog , i.e. , each run goes through the photometric pipeline photo separately , and the resulting catalogs are coadded .",
    "the sdss deep survey will eventually reach a depth of @xmath51 ( 5 @xmath52 detection for point sources ) with more than 50 epochs of data @xcite .",
    "the area and the depth will then be comparable to the cfhqs , which has covered @xmath53 deg@xmath1 to a limit of @xmath54 @xcite .    at the time the coadded images used in this paper were made , 2005 ,",
    "a given area of sky on stripe 82 had been scanned 518 times under standard sdss imaging conditions , and all available data were included in this version of the coadds .",
    "the construction of the coadds is summarized as follows .",
    "first , each input image was calibrated to a standard sdss zeropoint using the median of the sdss photometric solutions for the runs covering the area . for each image we made an inverse variance image to serve as a weight map , and within the map we assigned near - zero values to pixels with the interp bit set in the fpmask files of photo , which indicates that a bad pixel , bad column , or cosmic ray has been interpolated over .",
    "after the images were sky subtracted using the photo sky estimate , each image was mapped onto a uniform rectangular output astrometric grid using a modified version of the registration software swarp @xcite . the main modification was to incorporate the known sdss camera distortions into the astrometry .",
    "the weight maps were subjected to the same mapping .",
    "the mapping used the lanczos3 kernel for the images and weights , while the interp bit images were mapped using nearest before being used to set near - zero values in the weight map images .",
    "the mapped images were then coadded using a flux scaled inverse - variance weighted average .",
    "the resulting images had known photometric and astrometric calibrations . for precision photometry , the psfs as a function of position on the images were required .",
    "we used an algorithm ( implemented in photo ) that coadded the psfs as a function of position known from each input image using the same weights as the images were averaged .",
    "once the photometry , astrometry , and psf were known , we proceeded to run a version of frames ( the main portion of photo ) slightly modified to take effective gains and sky noises into account when calculating error estimates .",
    "the uncalibrated output of photo was adjusted and placed on the sdss ab system using a slightly modifed version of the sdss target selection software target .",
    "the details of the construction of the coadds will be left for a forthcoming paper .",
    "the resulting data were tested in three ways .",
    "first , object by object comparisons were made against single - run sdss data .",
    "second , object by object comparisons were made with the sdss coadded catalogs produced by suitably averaging all the catalog information from the individual runs covering stripe 82 ( courtesy of r. scranton and d. johnston ) .",
    "third , statistical internal measurements , such as stellar color - color diagrams , were made .",
    "these tests show that the images were properly coadded and the depth of the coadds is close to what was expected from standard error propagation .",
    "figure 1 compares the photometric errors of psf magnitudes for point sources in the sdss main survey data and the sdss coadded data .",
    "the error estimates were produced by the sdss photometric pipeline photo . from figure 1",
    "the photometric errors in the coadded data are significantly smaller than those in the single - run data .",
    "in this paper we used the data in the range @xmath55 , as there were significantly fewer than 10 runs covering the range @xmath56 .",
    "the data also contains some `` holes '' in which the coadded images were not available .",
    "the effective area for this work is 260 deg@xmath1 .",
    "the median seeing as measured in the @xmath57 bands was @xmath58 , where the error is the standard deviation of the seeing measured by photo across the coadded images on stripe 82 .",
    "because of the rarity of high - redshift quasars and overwhelming number of contaminants , our selection procedure of @xmath36 faint quasars from the multi - epoch sdss imaging data contains the following separate steps ( see also * ? ?",

    "* ) . at @xmath62 ,",
    "the photometric errors of the coadded data reach @xmath63 as shown in figure 1 , so the @xmath3 criterion guarantees a high quasar selection efficiency due to small photometric errors",

    "all @xmath23-dropout objects were visually inspected , and false detections were deleted from the list of candidates .",

    "<S> we present the discovery of five quasars at @xmath0 selected from 260 deg@xmath1 of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) southern survey , a deep imaging survey obtained by repeatedly scanning a stripe along the celestial equator . </S>",
    "<S> the five quasars with @xmath2 are 12 magnitudes fainter than the luminous @xmath0 quasars discovered in the sdss main survey . </S>",
    "<S> one of them was independently discovered by the ukirt infrared deep sky survey . </S>",
    "<S> these quasars , combined with another @xmath0 quasar known in this region , make a complete flux - limited quasar sample at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the sample spans the redshift range @xmath4 and the luminosity range @xmath5 ( h@xmath6 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use the @xmath10 method to determine that the comoving quasar spatial density at @xmath11 and @xmath12 is @xmath13 mpc@xmath14 mag@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we model the bright - end quasar luminosity function ( qlf ) at @xmath0 as a power law @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the slope @xmath16 calculated from a combination of our sample and the luminous sdss quasar sample is @xmath17 , significantly steeper than the slope of the qlf at @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> based on the derived qlf , we find that the quasar / agn population can not provide enough photons to ionize the intergalactic medium ( igm ) at @xmath0 unless the igm is very homogeneous and the luminosity ( @xmath19 ) at which the qlf power law breaks is very low . </S>"
