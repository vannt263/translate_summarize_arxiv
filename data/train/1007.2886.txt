    "there is long - standing interest in 6-quark dibaryons and 3 quark - 3 antiquark `` baryonium '' states which are permitted in qcd , and may possibly exist",
    ". of particular interest is a possible bound state of a proton and an antiproton .",
    "the @xmath11 state , sometimes called `` protonium '' , was searched for in many experiments , but no credible evidence was found  @xcite .",
    "interest was revived in 2002 by two reports by the belle collaboration of threshold enhancements in @xmath20 in the decays @xmath21  @xcite and @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "these reports were followed by a bes report of threshold enhancement in the decay @xmath16",
    "subsequently , there have been reports of threshold enhancements and studies by belle in @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25  @xcite ; by babar in @xmath26  @xcite ; and @xmath27  @xcite ; and most recently by belle in @xmath26 and @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "many theoretical explanations , cusp effects , final state interactions , quark fragmentation , and real bound states of quarks and gluons , have been suggested for these threshold enhancements  @xcite .",
    "if the enhancement reported by bes in the decay @xmath16  @xcite is due to a threshold resonance , it is reasonable to expect that evidence for it may be found also in @xmath28 .",
    "further insight into its nature may be provided by the study of the reactions @xmath29 and @xmath3 .",
    "in this paper we report on studies of these reactions observed in the cleo - c detector in a data sample of 24.5 million @xmath0 events obtained by @xmath4 annihilations at @xmath303.686 gev at the cornell electron storage ring , cesr .",
    "in addition , we use 20.7 pb@xmath31 of off - resonance data taken at @xmath32 gev .",
    "the cleo - c detector , described in detail elsewhere  @xcite , has a solid angle coverage of 93@xmath33 for charged and neutral particles .",
    "the charged particle tracking and identification system operates in a 1.0 t solenoidal magnetic field , and consists of an inner drift chamber , a central drift chamber , and a ring - imaging cherenkov ( rich ) detector .",
    "it has a momentum resolution of @xmath340.6@xmath33 at momenta of @xmath341 gev/@xmath35 .",
    "the csi elecromagnetic calorimeter has a photon energy resolution of @xmath342.2@xmath33 for @xmath36 gev and @xmath345@xmath33 at 100 mev .",
    "photons and charged particles with @xmath37 were accepted in the detector , where @xmath38 is the polar angle with respect to the incoming positron beam .",
    "for the modes involving the direct decays of the @xmath0 , exactly two oppositely charged tracks were required in candidate events .",
    "a photon candidate was defined as a shower which does not match a track within 100 mrad , is not in one of the few cells of the electromagnetic calorimeter known to be noisy , has the transverse distribution of energy consistent with an electromagnetic shower , and has an energy more than 30 mev . for @xmath1 the number of showers",
    "was required to be @xmath39 , and it was required that the most energetic shower ( the signal photon candidate ) does not make a @xmath14 or @xmath15 with any other shower with a pull mass @xmath40 . for @xmath2 and @xmath3 the number of showers was required to be @xmath41 .",
    "to identify charged tracks as protons and antiprotons , the energy loss in the drift chambers ( @xmath42 ) and rich information was used . for tracks of momentum less than 0.9 gev/@xmath35 , only @xmath42 information is used . to utilize @xmath42 information , for each particle hypothesis , @xmath43 or @xmath44",
    ", we calculate @xmath45/\\sigma_{x}$ ] , where @xmath46 is the measured value of @xmath42 , @xmath47 is the predicted value for hypothesis @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is the standard deviation of the measurements for hypothesis @xmath48 .",
    "we cut on both the deviation of the measured @xmath42 from a given particle hypothesis , @xmath50 , and the difference in @xmath51 between two particle hypotheses , @xmath52 . for higher momentum tracks , we use a combined log - likelihood variable . for example , to differentiate between proton and pion we construct @xmath53 where @xmath54 are the log - likelihoods obtained from the rich subdetector .",
    "we use rich information if the track has @xmath55 and the track has valid rich information for at least one hypothesis ( pion or proton ) , and at least three photons consistent with that hypothesis were recorded in the rich .",
    "we consider three different momentum regions for charged tracks .    *",
    "* p @xmath56 0.9 gev/@xmath57 : * in this momentum region only @xmath42 information for the tracks is available , and it is required that it be within @xmath58 of the proton hypothesis , and must be more `` proton - like '' than `` pion - like '' or `` kaon - like '' , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 . *",
    "* 0.9 gev/@xmath57 @xmath56 p @xmath56 1.15 gev/@xmath57 : * in this momentum region , although we are above the threshold for a proton to emit cherenkov radiation in the rich , the probability that it will do so is still low . therefore , if rich information is available , we require that the track be more `` proton - like '' in the combined log - likelihood variable , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath62 .",
    "if rich information is not available , we again require that @xmath59 , and additionally require a @xmath63 difference between the proton hypothesis and the pion and kaon hypotheses , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , in order to reduce the number of other particles which pass these cuts . *",
    "* p @xmath66 1.15 gev/@xmath57 : * in this momentum region , @xmath42 alone no longer provides useful information for proton identification .",
    "we require that rich information be available , and that @xmath62 .",
    "we require one of the charged tracks to be identified as a proton or antiproton and assume the other track to be its antiparticle as required by baryon conservation , and we require the proton and antiproton to come from a common vertex , with kinematic fit yielding @xmath67 .    finally , in order to select the events for the channels of interest :    * for selection of @xmath68 events we require @xmath69 for the four - momentum conservation constrained fit to @xmath70 , @xmath44 and the signal photon candidate . * for selection of @xmath71 events , we first require that only one @xmath14(@xmath15 ) be made by any two photons and the pull mass",
    "be within 3@xmath72 .",
    "then we require @xmath73 for the four - momentum conservation constrained fit to @xmath70 , @xmath44 , and @xmath74 .",
    "we remove the events corresponding to @xmath75 by rejecting candidates for which @xmath76 mev/@xmath77 .",
    "figure  1 shows the distribution of @xmath78 before and after the selection of @xmath14 and @xmath15 described above . * for selection of @xmath79 , @xmath16 events",
    "the additional event selection requirements are described in sec .",
    "the values of the @xmath80 cuts for the fits were selected based on the comparison of the data and the phase space distributions for the individual decays obtained from monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .     in @xmath81 .",
    "the unshaded histogram shows the @xmath78 distribution before the selection of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and the shaded histogram shows it after the @xmath14 and @xmath15 selection described in the text.,width=307 ]",
    "in order to verify the event selection criteria and determine efficiencies , 50,000 phase space mc events were generated for each decay channel analyzed .",
    "as an example , for @xmath68 events with @xmath822.85 gev/@xmath77 the contribution of each step of event selection is presented in table  i. the overall phase space efficiency is @xmath83 .",
