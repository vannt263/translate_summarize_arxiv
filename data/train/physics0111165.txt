    "discrete symmetry violations in atoms are important phenomena to probe for physics beyond the standard model(sm ) of the particle physics .",
    "the electric dipole moment(edm ) of an atom , which is a signature of the simultaneous parity and time - reversal ( p - t ) symmetry violations is one such .",
    "there are several possible sources of p - t violation effects within an atom , the tensor pseudo - tensor electron nucleus interaction is an example which is semi - leptonic in nature .",
    "the atomic yb , which is a closed - shell atom having a @xmath3 is a very good candidate for atomic edm experiments to probe for the nuclear sector effects .",
    "an additional advantage of using a rare earth atom like yb is the closely spaced energy levels .",
    "the experimental results when compared with the theoretical results can yield signatures of physics beyond the sm .    among the closed - shell atoms , the atom edm of xe@xcite and hg@xcite",
    "have been measured . though the hg experiment has set the record of being the most sensitive spectroscopy ever done ,",
    "the result obtained is null and sets an upper bound to atomic hg edm as @xmath4 .",
    "still , it has set bounds on the parameters in particle physics models@xcite .",
    "improving the accuracy further is an important challenge in atomic edm experiments .",
    "atomic yb offer a possibility of achieving this by using the techniques of laser cooling and trapping .",
    "it is also desirable that the edm measurements be done in other closed - shell atoms to verify the physical effects observed .",
    "atomic yb also has the advantage of being relatively simple in level structure among the rare earth elements .",
    "it has been studied theoretically using a variety of atomic many - body methods and there are ongoing experimental studies .",
    "the excitation energies has been studied using relativistic coupled - cluster method@xcite ; the hyperfine structure constants and electric - dipole transition properties have been studied using multireference relativistic many - body perturbation theory@xcite ; and the oscillator strength of some of the important transitions were investigated using multi - configuration relativistic hartree - fock@xcite .",
    "the lifetime of some of the crucial levels have been measured experimentally@xcite and atomic yb has been laser cooled and trapped@xcite .",
    "it is the candidate for the atomic edm experiments using the methods of laser cooling and trapping of atoms which are in progress@xcite .",
    "the p - t violating effects which can be probed using atomic yb are the tensor pseudotensor ( t - pt ) electron - nucleus interaction@xcite and the schiff moment@xcite .",
    "an observation of a finite edm of atomic yb could mean nonzero @xmath1 , which is a signature of physics beyond the sm as @xmath1 is zero within sm .",
    "hence the theories which allow t - pt electron - nucleus interactions would play a role in understanding nature . the parameter @xmath1 is extracted from the experimental result of atomic edm by combining with the theoretical calculations .",
    "accurate atomic theory calculations are needed to obtain precise @xmath1.the atomic edm can also put bounds on the parameters of alternative models in particle physics . the schiff moment which arises due to either nucleon edm or p - t violating interactions between the nucleons can also contribute to the yb edm and can be used to extract the nuclear p - t violation parameters .",
    "we have calculated the contribution to atomic yb edm from both these effects but in this paper we will present the result of our calculations for t - pt contribution alone , in a later paper we will present the result of our schiff moment computation .",

    "the calculation within the csf space of singly excited even parity csfs with core configurations @xmath251 and @xmath257 and all the odd parity csfs is identical with the result calculated using cepa-0 .",

    "the cepa-2 and mbpt results differ by less than 2% .",

    "this shows that the contribution from non - linear terms with @xmath260 is not negligible or the contribution from the size - consistent is significant , with the present results it is difficult to distinguish between the two .",
    "3 .   the @xmath0 calculated within the whole csf space considered is @xmath261 and is larger than the mbpt result by 1.4% and less than the cepa-0 result by 31.86% .",

    "the final value with the full csf space is @xmath263 , which is suppressed by 5.8% compared to the cepa-2 result .",
    "this difference is due to the epo contribution to the renormalization term in @xmath35 .",

    "the value of @xmath185 calculated using the wave - operator @xmath14 derived here has no contribution from the size inconsistent terms but it excludes some of the less important size - consistent terms .",
    "the difference in the value @xmath185 calculated using the bloch - equation and @xmath14 derived from the cluster equation gives the contribution from the size inconsistent terms . like in @xmath0",
    "the approximation is that the contribution form the epo size consistent terms non - linear in cluster amplitudes is very small , then the difference in the result can in principle be accounted to the size inconsistent terms .",
    "comparing the results from different methods , it is clear that a size - consistent theory is preferable for high accuracy computation of atomic edm and the contribution from the non - linear terms in the cluster amplitude is also important . with the present calculation",
    "the difference between the mbpt and cepa-2 result can not be accounted distinctly to non - linear terms or the size - inconsistent terms .",
    "a better comparison can be made after including all the non - linear terms in the cluster amplitudes .",

    "this puts a limitation during the calculation as the memory requirement increases , it is manageable if the calculation is done at the level of single particle  moller - plesset partitioning of the atomic hamiltonian . at the single particle level the cluster equation with the residual coulomb interaction hamiltonian reduces to the method",
