    "the numerical determination of transport parameters for electrons propagating in disordered two - dimensional systems with chiral symmetry still remains an important unsolved problem .",
    "the situation can be represented by a single - band tight - binding model defined on bipartite lattices subjected to purely off - diagonal disorder like a random - magnetic flux with zero mean or real random hopping terms .",
    "the latter belongs to the chiral orthogonal universality class while the former is chiral unitary .",
    "due to the chiral symmetry , the model exhibits metallic behavior only at energy @xmath0.@xcite it is therefore of considerable interest to study the critical properties of the model in the vicinity of the critical point and to investigate its universality .",
    "the traditional finite - size - scaling analysis of disorder driven metal - insulator transitions , i.e. , continuous quantum phase transitions at zero temperature , is based on two assumptions.@xcite ( i ) in the vicinity of the critical point all variables of interest are a function of only one parameter , [ b ] v(e , l ) = f(l/(e ) ) , where @xmath3 is the energy dependent correlation length . here",
    ", vicinity means that both the system size @xmath2 and @xmath3 are already larger than any other typical length of the model and @xmath7 .",
    "( ii ) at the critical energy @xmath8 , the correlation length @xmath3 diverges as [ a ] ( e)~|e - e_c|^- with a universal critical exponent @xmath9 .",
    "relation ( [ a ] ) was confirmed in a multitude of numerical work on disordered systems in spatial dimension @xmath10 and various physical symmetries.@xcite as scaling variables , for example , the localization length,@xcite the smallest lyapunov exponent,@xcite the two - terminal conductance,@xcite the energy level spacings,@xcite and the inverse participation ratio@xcite were successfully used .",
    "recently , the analysis of numerical data obtained for the energy dependence of the two - terminal conductance @xmath11 on a bricklayer lattice,@xcite which represents a generic lattice model for graphene , has led to a power - law energy dependence of the correlation length @xmath12 , where the critical exponent @xmath9 is close to @xmath13 .",
    "although this outcome is in agreement with previous numerical results@xcite for square and hexagonal lattices , it is at variance with the harris criterion @xcite which states that @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the euclidian dimension of the system .",
    "more importantly , all numerical data obtained to the present date do not agree with theoretical predictions,@xcite according to which the correlation length depends logarithmically on the energy , @xmath16,\\quad |e|\\ll e_0,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is related to the longitudinal conductivity and @xmath6 is assumed to be of the order of the energy band width.@xcite a possible explanation of this disagreement between theory and numerical experiments may be that the energies investigated in the numerical studies , down to @xmath18 so far@xcite ( in units of the hopping energy ) , are not sufficiently small in comparison to the unspecified parameter @xmath6 introduced in the theory .",
    "thus , it could be that the energy interval @xmath4 , where the scaling holds , was not reached in previous numerical studies .",
    "a second obstacle is the vanishing of the density of states @xmath19 which occurs at @xmath0 for hexagonal and bricklayer lattices in the presence of random - magnetic - flux disorder.@xcite this behavior persists even in strongly disordered chiral systems so that the two - terminal conductance , which nevertheless turns out to be finite @xmath20 at the dirac - point in graphene,@xcite is not a suitable scaling variable for numerical studies .",
    "therefore , it is expedient to investigate instead the smallest lyapunov exponents , which are associated with the localization length and are not directly affected by the vanishing density of states .    in this paper , we analyze the scaling behavior of both the two - dimensional bricklayer and square - lattice model with random - magnetic - flux disorder . using the transfer - matrix method for quasi-1d systems,@xcite",
    "we calculate the two smallest lyapunov exponents @xmath21 and @xmath22 for energies very close to @xmath0 , not achieved in previous work .",
    "lyapunov exponents are more suitable than the conductance since they are less sensitive to the energy dependence of the density of states .",
    "another reason for using lyapunov exponents is that the analysis of the conductance is far more time consuming , which is crucial since quadruple precision is necessary in our case when energies smaller than @xmath23 are considered .",
    "we show that in the vicinity of the critical point our numerical data for the lyapunov exponents lead to the relation [ scal-1 ] z_1,2(e , l ) = f_1,2 ( ) where @xmath2 is the width of the system .",
    "we prove that the correlation length @xmath3 depends logarithmically on the energy ( see eq .",

    "indicates that only the transfers along every other vertical bond are included . in this way , the square lattice is transformed into a bricklayer where the coordination number is reduced to three nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "the bricklayer lattice has the same topology as the honeycomb lattice of graphene and the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) possesses the same eigenvalues @xmath28 .",
    "the phases , which are chosen to be associated only with the vertical bonds in the @xmath29-direction , @xmath30 , are defined by the random magnetic flux @xmath31 , which is uniformly distributed @xmath32 with zero mean and disorder strength @xmath33 .",
    "the random magnetic flux is pointing perpendicular to the 2d lattice and periodic boundary conditions are applied in the @xmath29 direction .",
    "in contrast to diagonal disorder , this random flux preserves the chiral symmetry for both the square and bricklayer lattices .",
