    "in recent years multiferroic magnetoelectrics attracted increasing scientific and technological interest.@xcite in this rare class of compounds , ferroelectricity ( or at least a weak ferroelectric component ) and ( ferro-)magnetism coexist and both order - parameters are strongly coupled .",
    "this coupling of the dielectric and magnetic properties makes them highly attractive not only from an academic point of view , but also for potential applications in microelectronics .",
    "ferromagnetism is known since ancient times and a prerequisite of modern technology in many areas .",
    "ferroelectricity has been identified in 1921 by valasek@xcite in seignette salt and the existence of ferroelectricity in an oxide has been established as late as 1943 in batio@xmath3 by von hippel and coworkers.@xcite ferroelectrics play an important role in thze technological revolution in optics , acoustics , and capacitor engineering for a variety of applications in electronic circuitry and modern energy storage .",
    "the coexistence of ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism would constitute another mile stone for modern electronics and functionalized materials .",
    "the most appealing applications are new types of storage media using both magnetic _ and _ electric polarization and the possibility of electrically reading / writing magnetic memory devices ( and vice versa ) .",
    "the first multiferroic material , revealing magnetic _ and _ electric order to be discovered was nickel - iodine boracite in 1966@xcite and nowadays multiferroic materials are in the focus of interest of recent solid state research .",
    "prominent examples for such type of materials are the heavy rare earth manganites like the perovskites tbmno@xmath3 or dymno@xmath3,@xcite orthorombic tbmn@xmath1o@xmath4,@xcite the hexagonal ymno@xmath3 and homno@xmath3,@xcite or the kagom staircase compound ni@xmath3v@xmath1o@xmath5.@xcite this contribution summarizes the results on the recently discovered multiferroic and magneto - capacitive properties of the cubic spinel systems cdcr@xmath1s@xmath2  and hgcr@xmath1s@xmath2.@xcite we report on magnetization , dielectric polarization , as well as broadband dielectric measurements in these systems and provide detailed information on the dielectric relaxation dynamics . in addition , the influence of impurity doping and sample dependence is addressed .",
    "spinel compounds are an important class of materials : for example , spinels are a key constituent in the deep - earth mantle ; and they are great imposters in gemstone history , often mistaken for rubies , even in crown jewels . the magnetic properties of spinel - type compounds have long been known and are in the focus of applied research since more than 50 years .",
    "ferrites with spinel structure are being used for many applications in microwave technology and high - frequency electronics .",
    "spinels have also been in the focus of basic research . the metal - insulator transition in fe@xmath3o@xmath2",
    "was described by vervey@xcite in 1939 as a charge - ordering transition but this interpretation remains controversial .",
    "recent reports on geometrical frustration of the spin and orbital degrees of freedom,@xcite and the observation of an orbital glass state@xcite in sulpho spinels , demonstrate the rich and complex physics , characteristic of these compounds .",
    "the richness is a result of the cooperativity of and the delicate balance between charge , spin , orbital , and lattice degrees of freedom .",

    "the cr@xmath10 ions on the octahedrally coordinated @xmath11-sites , which form a pyrochlore lattice , possess half filled @xmath12 shells and thus also are orbitally inactive . but due to the quenched orbital moment and hund s coupling , the @xmath11-sites carry a @xmath13 spin configuration .",

    "@xcite the absence of orbital degrees of freedom in an highly symmetric lattice , changes the prerequisites for polar order in the compound .",
    "jahn - teller active orbital degrees of freedom may trigger non - polar lattice distortions .",
    "then the cubic lattice relaxes into a jahn - teller distorted , orbitally ordered structure of lower symmetry .",
    "these distortions can be expected to be non - polar due to the symmetry of the electronic charge distribution of the orbital , to which the positions of the surrounding ligands are adapted.@xcite an example is the jahn - teller active system fecr@xmath1s@xmath2.@xcite in contrast , the absence of any orbital degrees of freedom , as it is realized via the @xmath14 electronic configuration in canonical ferroelectrics like batio@xmath15 , allows for the relaxation of the structure into polar off - center distortions . in cdcr@xmath1s@xmath2  and hgcr@xmath1s@xmath2",

    "the increase of the dielectric constant for temperatures between 40  k ( high frequencies , 3 mhz ) and about 70  k ( low frequencies , 1.7  hz ) is much stronger than in cdcr@xmath1s@xmath2 .",
    "correspondingly , a pronounced magnetic field dependence of the permittivity can be expected in the regarded temperatures range .",
    "[ 8 ] displays the dielectric constant @xmath77 in magnetic fields up to 5  t for various frequencies .",
    "the application of an external magnetic field enhances the ferromagnetic correlations and shifts their appearance towards higher temperatures . as a consequence",
    "the mentioned re - acceleration of the dielectric dynamics is induced by the magnetic field and @xmath32 considerably increases with increasing field .",
    "this effect is strongly frequency dependent again underlining the relaxational character of the magneto - capacitive coupling . at a temperature of 120  k and for frequencies in the hz - regime a magnetic field of 1  t easily can change the permittivity by a factor of ten . under the same conditions the response for frequencies above 30  khz is barely effected .",
    "the details of the frequency dependence of the complex permittivity are monitored in fig .  [ 9 ] . the representation as permittivity spectra @xmath78 contains the most significant information on the relaxation dynamics .",
    "the condition @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the position of the maximum in the dielectric loss or the point of inflection in the step of the dielectric constant allows for the straightforward determination of the relaxation time @xmath81 .",
    "typical relaxation steps in @xmath39 are monitored for various temperatures in figs .",
    "[ 9]a and b , and the accompanying loss peaks are observed in @xmath82 in figs .  [ 9]c and d. ( note that the increase in the loss spectra observed towards low frequencies results from finite dc - conductivity as discussed below ) .",
    "considering the steps in @xmath32 in the low temperature region ( fig .  [ 9]a ) , the usual thermally activated scenario becomes apparent : they shift to higher frequency , i.e. the dynamics becomes faster with increasing temperature .",
    "but in the temperature range around the onset of ferromagnetic fluctuations between 30 and 80  k ( fig .",
    "[ 9]b ) the opposite behavior is found : the system seems to slow down with increasing temperature ! obviously , in this regime not the temperature but the magnetic correlations seem to determine the relaxation rate . on the other hand the dc - conductivity of hgcr@xmath1s@xmath2experiences very pronounced changes at about 80  k and also exhibit a strong magnetic field dependence.@xcite thus this material exhibits cmr and cmc properties at the same time .",
    "however , a direct relation between both quantities is not obvious , as has been pointed out above , and the relaxational character of the dielectric response does not point towards charge transport as the origin of the strong anomalies in @xmath32 .",
    "strong spin - disorder scattering has been postulated for ferromagnetic semiconductors with very small charge carrier concentrations.@xcite an enhanced local electronic polarizability could link the charge transport to the relaxor ferroelectric properties in these slightly doped spinel systems . but",
    "further investigations and a more detailed theoretical approach would be necessary to settle such a picture .",
    "s@xmath2  and cdcr@xmath1s@xmath2  in an arrhenius - type presentation .",
    "the inset displays a magnification of the high temperature behavior.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    a quantitative evaluation of the results shown in fig .",
    "[ 9 ] was obtained from the simultaneous fitting of the real and imaginary part of the permittivity data , the resulting fit curves being displayed as solid lines . the fits account for an symmetric ( cole - cole ) distribution of relaxation times centered at @xmath83 ,",
    "dc - conductivity and dc - dielectric constant , and an ac - conductivity contribution @xmath84 with @xmath85.@xcite the latter term via the kramers - kronig relation is related to the imaginary part of the conductivity and thus also gives a contribution to the real part of the permittivity @xmath86 . in literature this power - law type of contribution is referred to as `` universal dielectric response '' and usually assumed to account for hopping transport processes.@xcite the mean relaxation times resulting from this type of evaluation are displayed as @xmath87 in fig .",
    "[ 10 ] for hgcr@xmath1s@xmath2  and cdcr@xmath1s@xmath2 . at high temperatures ( small values of @xmath88 ;",
    "see inset of fig .  [ 10 ] ) the mentioned conventional relaxational freezing scenario , corresponding to an increase of @xmath81 with decreasing @xmath89 , can be followed for cdcr@xmath1s@xmath2 .",
    "then for both compounds an anomalous regime occurs , in which the relaxation times become reduced for decreasing temperatures . in this regime the magnetic field and the magnetization lead to a re - acceleration of the dynamics and the frozen relaxor - system melts again . finally , at lowest temperatures , where the influence of the magnetization saturates , a scenario of thermal activation becomes dominant again and the dynamics slow down again . in this regime",
    "the relaxation time in hgcr@xmath1s@xmath2  is about two decades lower than in cdcr@xmath1s@xmath2 .",
    "this difference is difficult to explain considering the different magnetic configuration of both compounds . as ferromagnetism seems to decrease @xmath81 , the completely ferromagnetically ordered cdcr@xmath1s@xmath2",
    "should rather show the faster dielectric response .",
    "the in general larger dielectric response in hgcr@xmath1s@xmath2  also would point towards larger relaxor entities with accordingly higher relaxation times .",
    "the present dielectric experiments provide clear evidence for an relaxational process using the observed magneto - capacitive phenomena .",
    "the ferroelectric distortions are supposed to result from an off - center position of the cr@xmath10-ions which generates a locally polar but macroscopically isotropic cluster state.@xcite especially in hgcr@xmath1s@xmath2  bond frustration of the magnetic sector may play a considerable role .",
    "but the structural frustration within the cubic lattice , which at room temperature is highly symmetric and geometrically unconstrained , is supposed to be the constituting ingredient driving the observed relaxor - like freezing.@xcite however , recent lda+u calculations did not find any indication for the softening of a polar phonon mode which could explain the local ferroelectric distortions.@xcite nevertheless , pronounced spin - phonon coupling could be investigated via optical spectroscopy in magnetic fields and will be reported in a forthcoming paper . on the other hand , the details of the coupling mechanism between magnetization or the magnetic field and the dielectric permittivity in these compounds is so far unclear .",
    "as pointed out above , the relaxation dynamics of the polar moments is accelerated below @xmath31 , but the microscopic origin of the detected relaxation dynamics and why this dynamics couples so strongly to the magnetic order parameter is still unknown .",
    "most plausible is a coupling via exchange striction , i.e. volume changes arising from the magnetic exchange energy.@xcite the onset of spin order leads to a local magnetostrictive distortion of the lattice .",
    "thus the energy barriers against dipolar reorientation are reduced and the mean relaxation rate is enhanced .",
    "an alternative explanation could be a magnetic - field induced variation of charge - carrier mobility or density .",
    "as mentioned before , a sizable dc magneto - resistive effect is well known for cdcr@xmath1s@xmath2  and hgcr@xmath1s@xmath2,@xcite even so the dc - conductivity of course not directly contributes to @xmath32 , but only to @xmath46 .",
    "its variation may denote changes in the electronic polarizability.@xcite within such a scenario one could expect a strong enhancement of the dielectric constant in the vicinity of a metal - insulator transition , e.g. driven by charge doping of semiconductors.@xcite however , the influence of purely electronic degrees of freedom probably can not explain the observed dispersion in the investigated frequency range .",
    "finally , even though the influence of the electrode polarization via maxwell - wagner type of processes appears to be unlikely if considering our experiments with different types of contacts , the importance of possible internal boundary mechanisms can not be completely ruled out , and needs further clarification.@xcite    in summary , our results reveal that in cdcr@xmath1s@xmath2  and hgcr@xmath1s@xmath2  ferromagnetic order , or at least strong ferromagnetic fluctuations , coexists with a relaxor - ferroelectric state , characterized by a significant relaxational behavior .",
    "both properties are strongly coupled .",
    "the observed strong increase of the dielectric permittivity in the magnetically ordered state of these compounds can be explained by a re - acceleration of the dielectric relaxor dynamics .",
    "these are influenced by the onset of magnetization , which can be driven by external magnetic fields .",
    "this results in a colossal magneto - capacitive effect , which exhibits a pronounced frequency dependence . concerning the microscopic origin of the observed effects",
    "further investigations are needed .",
