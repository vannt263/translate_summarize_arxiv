    "cooperative control of a network of autonomous agents has been an emerging research direction and attracted a lot of attention from many scientific communities , especially the systems and control community .",
    "a group of autonomous agents , by coordinating with each other via communication or sensing networks , can perform certain challenging tasks which can not be well accomplished by a single agent .",
    "cooperative control of multi - agent systems has potential applications in broad areas including spacecraft formation flying , sensor networks , and cooperative surveillance @xcite . in the area of cooperative control",
    ", consensus is an important and fundamental problem , which means to develop distributed control policies using only local information to ensure that the agents reach an agreement on certain quantities of interest .",
    "two pioneering works on consensus are @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a theoretical explanation is provided in @xcite for the alignment behavior observed in the vicsek model @xcite and a general framework of the consensus problem for networks of integrators is proposed in @xcite . since then",
    ", the consensus problem has been extensively studied by various scholars from different perspectives ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "existing consensus algorithms can be roughly categorized into two classes , namely , consensus without a leader ( i.e. , leaderless consensus ) and consensus with a leader . the latter is also called leader - follower consensus or distributed tracking . in @xcite ,",
    "a sufficient condition is derived to achieve consensus for multi - agent systems with jointly connected communication graphs .",
    "the authors in @xcite design a distributed neighbor - based estimator to track an active leader .",
    "distributed tracking algorithms are proposed in @xcite and @xcite for a network of agents with first - order dynamics .",
    "consensus of networks of double- and high - order integrators is studied in @xcite .",
    "consensus algorithms are designed in @xcite for multi - agent systems with quantized communication links .",
    "the authors in @xcite address a distributed tracking problem for multiple euler - lagrange systems with a dynamic leader .",
    "the consensus problem of multi - agent systems with general discrete- and continuous - time linear dynamics is studied in @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the design of the consensus protocols in @xcite requires the knowledge of the eigenvalues of the laplacian matrix of the communication graph , which is actually global information . to overcome this limitation , distributed adaptive consensus protocols",
    "are proposed in @xcite . for the case where there exists a leader with possibly nonzero control input , distributed controllers",
    "are proposed in @xcite to solve the leader - follower consensus problem .",
    "a common assumption in @xcite is that the dynamics of the agents are identical and precisely known , which might be restrictive and not practical in many circumstances . in practical applications ,",
    "the agents may be subject to certain parameter uncertainties or unknown external disturbances .",
    "this paper considers the distributed consensus problem of multi - agent systems with identical nominal linear dynamics but subject to different matching uncertainties .",
    "a typical example belonging to this scenario is a network of mass - spring systems with different masses or unknown spring constants . due to the existence of the nonidentical uncertainties which may be time - varying , nonlinear and unknown , the multi - agent systems discussed in this paper are essentially heterogeneous .",
    "the heterogeneous multi - agent systems in this paper contain the homogeneous linear multi - agent systems studied in @xcite as a special case where the uncertainties do not exist .",
    "note that because of the existence of the uncertainties , the consensus problem in this case becomes quite challenging to solve and the consensus algorithms given in @xcite are not applicable any more .    in this paper",
    ", we present a systematic procedure to address the distributed robust consensus problem of multi - agent systems with matching uncertainties for both the cases without and with a leader of possibly nonzero control input .",
    "first , we consider the case where the communication graph is undirected and connected . a distributed continuous static consensus protocol based on the relative states of neighboring agents",
    "is designed , under which the consensus error is uniformly ultimately bounded and exponentially converges to a small residual set .",
    "note that the design of this protocol relies on the eigenvalues of the laplacian matrix and the upper bounds of the matching uncertainties . in order to remove these requirements ,",
    "a fully distributed adaptive protocol is further designed , under which the residual set of the consensus error is also given .",
    "one desirable feature is that for both the static and adaptive protocols , the residual sets of the consensus error can be made to be reasonably small by properly selecting the design parameters of the protocols and the convergence rates of the consensus error are explicitly given .",
    "next , we extend to consider the case where there exists a leader with nonzero control input . here",
    "we study the general case where the leader s control input is not available to any follower , which imposes additional difficulty .",
    "distributed static and adaptive consensus protocols based on the relative state information are proposed and designed to ensure that the consensus error can converge to residual sets which are explicitly given and adjustable .",
    "the case where the external disturbances associated with the agent dynamics are bounded and do not satisfy the matching condition is also examined . the proposed consensus protocols are redesigned to guarantee the boundedness of the consensus error .",
    "the existence conditions of the consensus protocols proposed in this paper are discussed .",
    "it is pointed out that a sufficient condition of the existence of the protocols is that each agent is stabilizable .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in related works @xcite , the distributed tracking problem of multi - agent systems with unknown nonlinear dynamics are discussed .",
    "compared to @xcite , the contribution of this paper is at least three - fold .",
    "first , the agents in @xcite are restricted to be first - order and special high - order systems .",
    "it is far from trivial to extend @xcite to solve the consensus problem of the general high - order multi - agent systems with matching uncertainties as in this paper .",
    "second , contrary to @xcite which consider only the case with a leader , consensus for both the cases with and without a leader is addressed in this paper .",
    "third , the design of the protocols in @xcite depends on global information of the communication graph .",
    "in contrast , the adaptive consensus protocols proposed in this paper are fully distributed , which do not require any global information .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "some useful results of graph theory are reviewed in section 2 .",
    "the distributed robust leaderless consensus problem is discussed in section 3 for the case with an undirected graph .",
    "the robust leader - follower consensus problem is addressed in section 4 for the case where there exists a leader with unknown control input .",
    "the robustness of the proposed consensus protocols with respect to external disturbances which do not satisfy the matching condition is discussed in section 5 .",

    "<S> this paper considers the distributed consensus problem of linear multi - agent systems subject to different matching uncertainties for both the cases without and with a leader of bounded unknown control input . due to the existence of nonidentical uncertainties , the multi - agent systems discussed in this paper are essentially heterogeneous . for the case where the communication graph is undirected and connected , </S>",
    "<S> a distributed continuous static consensus protocol based on the relative state information is first designed , under which the consensus error is uniformly ultimately bounded and exponentially converges to a small adjustable residual set . a fully distributed adaptive consensus protocol </S>",
    "<S> is then designed , which , contrary to the static protocol , relies on neither the eigenvalues of the laplacian matrix nor the upper bounds of the uncertainties . for the case where there exists a leader </S>",
    "<S> whose control input is unknown and bounded , distributed static and adaptive consensus protocols are proposed to ensure the boundedness of the consensus error . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that the proposed protocols can be redesigned so as to ensure the boundedness of the consensus error in the presence of bounded external disturbances which do not satisfy the matching condition . </S>",
    "<S> a sufficient condition for the existence of the proposed protocols is that each agent is stabilizable .    ,    </S>",
