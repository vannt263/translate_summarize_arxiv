    "the resonance lines of ionized metals are sensitive indicators of the stellar winds of ob stars , which are rarefied environments characterized by low degrees of excitation .",
    "accessible transitions fall in the ultraviolet ( uv ) and far ultraviolet ( fuv ) , where they create distinctive p  cygni profiles by scattering uv continuum photons . however , the species available to _ iue _ and _ hst _  , , and  are not good estimators of the mass - loss rate . unsaturated lines are usually from trace ions ( e.g. , ) , so their interpretation depends on the details of the physics used to model them .",
    "although is a dominant ion over most of the ob - star domain , carbon is so abundant that the line is usually saturated and only provides a lower limit on the mass flux .",
    "consequently , the most reliable mass - loss estimates to date come from intrinsically weaker wind diagnostics like h@xmath2 or free - free emission .    the wealth of resonance lines available in the fuv help to overcome these problems , since they include diagnostics of abundant and rare elements that sample a wide range of ionization potential , including dominant ( e.g. , ) and trace ( e.g. , ) ionic species and multiple ionization stages ( e.g. , / ; / ) .",
    "previous work with the _ copernicus _ satellite concentrated on early - type stars in the galaxy , many of which are severely affected by interstellar absorption .",
    "more recent fuv spectra of targets in the galaxy and the magellanic clouds were obtained by the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the berkeley spectrometer on the _ orfeus _ missions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the launch of the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( _ fuse _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) revives the possibility of using resonance lines to determine mass - loss rates for many galactic and extragalactic ob stars .    in this letter",
    "we compare _ fuse _ spectra of a pair of o7 supergiants , one in each magellanic cloud , and use non - lte , line - blanketed model atmospheres to interpret the differences .",
    "the uv spectrum of the target in the lmc , sk  @xmath0 , was analyzed by @xcite , but otherwise this star has received little attention . in contrast , sk  80 = av  232 is a well - studied object situated on the edge of the giant region ngc  346 in the smc . its uv / optical spectrum has been discussed by @xcite , and a hut spectrum is described by @xcite .",
    "basic observational quantities for both targets are listed in table  [ targets ] .",
    "spectra of sk  @xmath0 and sk  80 were obtained in 1999 september as part of the _ fuse _ early - release observation program and again in 1999 october during mirror alignment tests .",
    "these observations were made in time - tag mode through the 30@xmath3 30 ( lwrs ) aperture ( see * ? ? ? * ) and are characterized by spectral resolution of 12,00015,000 @xcite . since alignment of the four spectrograph channels was not maintained , the number of channels contributing to the final spectrum and the effective exposure times vary with wavelength .",
    "the effective exposure time per channel ranges from 2.7 to 4.9  ksec for sk  @xmath0 and 1.2 to 4.9  ksec for sk  80 , and results in measured signal - to - noise ratios of 1520 per resolution element .",
    "the spectra were processed to remove telescope motions during the alignment tests , collapsed in the spatial dimension , and calibrated in flux and wavelength .",
    "model fits to the interstellar h@xmath4 spectrum ( see @xcite ) were used to improve the wavelength scale before resampling the spectra to a constant wavelength step of 0.13   .",
    "the calibrated spectra are shown in figure  [ fusedata ] , along with identifications of important stellar features and the model of the interstellar h@xmath4 spectrum for sk  @xmath0 .",
    "[ fusedata ] also compares the _ fuse _ spectrum of sk  80 with spectra obtained by hut during the astro-2 mission @xcite and the berkeley spectrograph during the _ orfeus - spas ii _",
    "mission @xcite .",
    "this comparison emphasizes the extremely low background of the _ fuse _ detectors , the reliability of the preliminary flux and wavelength calibrations , and the advantages of high spectral resolution for disentangling interstellar absorptions from stellar features .",
    "two morphological differences between sk  @xmath0 and sk  80 are conspicuous in fig .",
    "[ fusedata ] .",
    "first , the emission is much stronger in sk  80 . since sk  80 is substantially more luminous than sk  @xmath0 , this difference is likely attributable to the luminosity sensitivity exhibited by these lines @xcite .",
    "second , is barely present in the wind of sk  80 : no emission is visible and only weak absorptions are detectable at the positions corresponding to the terminal velocity ( @xmath5 ) . in contrast , the spectrum of sk  @xmath0 exhibits a well - formed p  cygni profile .",
    "otherwise , the most important difference between the wind lines in these stars is the smaller @xmath5 exhibited by sk  80 ; see also @xcite .",
    "the theory of line - driven stellar winds predicts that @xmath5 should decrease with decreasing metallicity @xcite .",
    "previous studies with _ iue _ and _ hst _ have shown that stars in the smc follow this trend ( see , e.g. , ) . after allowing for this systematic difference in breadth ,",
    "the absorption and emission strengths of the p  cygni profiles are surprisingly similar , despite the substantially lower metal abundances typical of the smc . some , but not all , of the differences in profile shape are due to blends with stellar or interstellar features .",
    "as a first step toward understanding the origin of these morphological differences , we used the program wm - basic ( v.1.13 ; a. w. a. pauldrach , t. l. hoffmann , & m. lennon , in preparation ) to compute synthetic spectra for both targets .",
    "this program solves the hydrodynamic wind equations for specified stellar parameters ; incorporates non - lte metal line blanketing in spherical , expanding geometry ; and permits the effects of strong shocks in the wind to be incorporated in the radiative transfer calculations .",
    "we initially adopted @xmath6 = 38kk for both stars , which is the mean value for three o7 supergiants ( including sk  80 ) determined by @xcite from non - lte modeling of photospheric lines in the plane parallel , hydrostatic approximation .",
    "their results for two o7  ib stars were used to estimate @xmath7 = 3.45 for sk  @xmath0 , while their determination of @xmath7 = 3.30 was used for sk  80 .",
    "we adopted he / h = 0.10 by number for both stars , and fixed the metal abundances at 0.4@xmath8 and 0.2@xmath8 for sk  @xmath0 and sk  80 , respectively .",
    "stellar radii were determined by requiring that the model fluxes reproduce the dereddened energy distribution of each star . by using reddening laws for the galactic foreground @xcite and magellanic cloud components , we derived foreground reddening of @xmath9 ( ) = 0.04 and 0.03 for sk  @xmath0 and sk  80 , respectively , and internal reddenings of 0.05 for both galaxies along these sightlines .",
    "although the total reddenings are low , they are consistent with the column densities of 10@xmath10@xmath11 derived for these stars from fits to the absorption wings of ly@xmath2 and @xmath12 .    for the adopted @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and radius , depth independent wind force multipliers ( @xmath2 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) were selected for wm - basic such that the observed values of @xmath5 ( table  [ targets ] ) were reproduced .",
    "we also required that the mass - loss rate be approximately correct . for sk  80",
    ", we matched the peak intensity of the h@xmath2 emission profile published by @xcite . since we are not aware of any h@xmath2 observations of sk  @xmath0 , we used the fact that its  @xmath154686 is filled in ( as implied by its ` ( f ) ' classification ) to constrain its mass - loss rate .",
    "figure  [ fusemodels ] compares the _ fuse _ spectra of the targets with synthetic spectra computed for @xmath6 = 38kk .",
    "the models do not reproduce the dominant wind features in the fuv spectra of these stars .",
    "in particular , they do not predict the occurrence of , , or to any significant degree .",
    "the absence of these ions implies that the initial wind models are too hot .",
    "we therefore computed cooler models characterized by @xmath6 = 33kk and 32kk for sk  @xmath0 and sk  80 , respectively .",
    "the synthetic spectra from these models are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fusemodels ] .",
    "as expected , the cooler temperatures improve the correspondence between the appearance of the and lines , and produce only minor changes in the resonance lines .",
    "although the agreement is much better , the cooler models predict profiles that are too strong and lines that are much weaker than observed .",
    "neither model predicts the occurrence of in the wind of sk  @xmath0 . to explore possible mechanisms for the production of this ion",
    ", we incorporated the extreme - uv radiation field due to strong shocks , which could be caused by the line - driven instability or the presence of other time - dependent structures in the wind ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we used the characterization of shock phenomena implemented in wm - basic with assumed input parameters of @xmath16 @xcite and @xmath17/@xmath5 = 0.12 .",
    "synthetic spectra from these models are included in fig .",
    "[ fusemodels ] as dotted lines . as expected , the presence of shocks increases the strength of the lines in all models . at the cooler @xmath6 , the shocks also decrease the strength of and substantially .",
    "the strength of the emission lobe of sk  @xmath0 is not reproduced at @xmath6 = 33kk .",
    "although the modeling is still preliminary , it is clear that models with @xmath6 @xmath1832kk are better matches to the _ fuse _ spectra of sk  @xmath0 and sk  80 than models with @xmath6 @xmath1838kk .",
    "provisional values for the parameters of the cooler models are listed in table  [ targets ] . even though o stars in the smc are predicted to have weaker winds than their counterparts in the lmc",
    ", the models suggest that the mass - loss rate of sk  80 exceeds the rate of sk  @xmath0 by a factor of @xmath183 .",
    "evidently the greater luminosity of sk  80 more than offsets any reduction in radiative driving due to reduced metallicity .",
    "although we have not yet computed model grids for different abundances of c and n that might arise from rotational mixing of cno - cycled material into the atmosphere @xcite , test calculations indicated that improved fits to the resonance line produce worse matches in the lines , since n enrichment is accompanied by c depletion .",
    "the _ fuse _ observations of sk  @xmath0 and sk  80 represent both a challenge to state - of - the - art model atmospheres and a unique opportunity to probe the physics of hot - star winds .",
    "we have identified two specific problems .",
    "first , initial analysis of the fuv spectra suggests that the temperatures of both stars are lower than the values derived from fits to photospheric lines by @xmath19kk .",
    "@xcite also found much cooler temperatures ( by @xmath188kk ) from their analysis of the optical wind lines of two galactic o8 supergiants .",
    "thus , the currently adopted temperatures for late o supergiants may be systematically too high .",
    "since @xcite found that fits to galactic o6 stars made with unified model atmospheres require lower temperatures than previous analyses ( by 3 and 4.5kk for a dwarf and supergiant , respectively ) , at least part of this discrepancy may be attributed to the inadequacies of plane - parallel model atmospheres .",
    "second , even line - blanketed wind models with @xmath6 = 38kk do not predict that much is present in the spectra of o7 supergiants . instead , the strong p  cygni profile exhibited by sk  @xmath0 must be due to the presence of shocks from time - dependent structures in the wind . @xcite and @xcite reached the same conclusion from their analyses of the fuv and uv spectra of hotter o supergiants .",
    "the absence of a comparable feature in sk  80 is puzzling : is it a direct consequence of the reduced metal abundance , or are the shocks intrinsically weaker in sk  80 because the wind velocities are smaller ?    _ fuse _ will observe a large sample of ob stars in the milky way , lmc , and smc in order to address these and other issues .",
    "a variety of complementary analysis techniques will be used to interpret these data , which will be combined with archival _ iue _ , _ hst _ , and optical data whenever possible .",
    "we anticipate that this work will return qualitatively new information about the properties of line - driven stellar winds .",
    "this work is based on data obtained for the guaranteed time team by the nasa - cnes - csa _ fuse _ mission operated by the johns hopkins university .",
    "financial support from nasa contract nas5 - 32985 ( u. s. participants ) , the csa space science program ( awf ) , the royal society ( pac ) , and pparc ( od ) is acknowledged .",
