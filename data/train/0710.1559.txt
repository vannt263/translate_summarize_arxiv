    "the goal of this article is to discuss the classical and quantum mechanics of systems whose hamiltonian @xmath0 is a function of the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian @xmath1 .",
    "the results can be easily generalized to other choices of @xmath1 for which the classical and quantum equations of motion are exactly solvable .    once we solve the classical equations of motion for @xmath1 , it is possible to study a system described by @xmath0 .",
    "although the solution is a straightforward exercise in classical mechanics , we will discuss it in detail because it is interesting to compare the solutions corresponding to both classical and quantum dynamics .",
    "quantum mechanically the unitary evolution operator for @xmath2 can also be constructed exactly once we know the evolution generated by @xmath3 .",
    "a comparison of the dynamics given by @xmath3 and @xmath4 will allow us to analyze some distinctive features of the coherent states of the harmonic oscillator and discuss the difficulties that appear when we try to construct similar states for the dynamics generated by @xmath5 .",
    "this comparison will help us understand some aspects of the open problem of building appropriate semiclassical states for general hamiltonians .",
    "non - trivial systems whose evolution can be solved exactly both classically and quantum mechanically are rare . usually , realistic systems are described by hamiltonians of the form @xmath6 , where @xmath1 is a solvable hamiltonian and @xmath7 represents a perturbation . in most cases it is impossible to give the solutions to the equations defined @xmath8 , so it is necessary to resort to approximation methods .",
    "the starting point of perturbation theory is the known dynamics generated by @xmath1 .",
    "the simplest choice of @xmath1 is the hamiltonian of a free particle .",
    "however , if we are considering a system that has bound states , it is much better to consider a solvable @xmath1 with bound states , such as the harmonic oscillator .",
    "in this paper we consider a different way to perturb a solvable hamiltonian @xmath1 by considering a _ function _ of it",
    ". if this function is close to the identity , it will be possible to treat the system as a perturbation of @xmath1 in the usual sense ; otherwise it will provide different but still solvable dynamics .",
    "we point out that these kind of hamiltonians appear in some physical applications , for example , in the context of quantum optics and classical and quantum gravity .",
    "for instance , the propagation of light in kerr media@xcite  media with a refractive index with a component that depends on the intensity of the propagating electric field  is described ( for a single mode field given by the creation and annihilation operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 and in the low loss approximation ) by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is related to the susceptibility of the medium , and the hamiltonian is a function of the number operator @xmath13 .",
    "the symbol @xmath14 denotes normal ordering ( creation operators to the left of the annihilation ones ) and the operators @xmath10 and @xmath15 satisfy the usual commutation relation @xmath16=1 $ ] .",
    "another situation where we find this kind of hamiltonian is in general relativity .",
    "einstein - rosen@xcite waves are cylindrically symmetric solutions to the einstein equations in vacuum .",
    "the hamiltonian that describes this system is@xcite @xmath17 where @xmath1 is a free ( and easily solvable ) hamiltonian .",
    "the examples we have mentioned are field theories with hamiltonians @xmath18 that are functions of free hamiltonians @xmath1",
    "( i.e. quadratic in the fields and their canonical conjugate momenta ) describing an infinite number of harmonic oscillators .",
    "although these models can be solved , we will concentrate here on finite dimensional examples to avoid field theoretical complications , in particular , issues related to the presence of an infinite number of degrees of freedom and the coupling of the infinite different modes induced by the function @xmath19 .",
    "we consider @xmath20 to simplify the calculations , we will assume that @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we will also work with an arbitrary function @xmath19 ( subject to some mild smoothness conditions ) until the very end of our discussion .",
    "at that point we will make some explicit calculations by using the functional form of the einstein - rosen hamiltonian .",
    "we emphasize that similar arguments could be made for any system whose hamiltonian is a function of a solvable one .",
    "we first discuss the classical solution for @xmath23 . the dynamics generated by @xmath1",
    "is given by the equations @xmath24 here we denote the time parameter as @xmath25 because in the following we will compare two types of related dynamics where two different time parameters will be relevant .",
    "the general solution to these equations can be written as :    [ 5 ] @xmath26    where @xmath27 and its complex conjugate , denoted as @xmath28 , are fixed by the initial conditions ( at @xmath29 ) @xmath30 in view of this last expression it is useful to introduce a complex variable @xmath31 to describe positions and momenta simultaneously . in particular eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath32 the trajectories in phase space , described now as the complex @xmath33-plane , are circumferences centered in the origin with radius @xmath34 .",
    "consider next the solutions for @xmath0 . to have well - defined equations of motion we require that the function @xmath19 be differentiable .",
    "the equations of motion now read    [ class ] @xmath35    where @xmath36 denotes the derivative of @xmath19 with respect to its argument and @xmath37 is the poisson bracket . in principle , these coupled , non - linear , differential equations might seem difficult to solve , but because @xmath1 is a constant of motion , @xmath38 we can simplify them by introducing a new time parameter @xmath39 the reparametrization given by eq .",
    "( [ reparam ] ) allows us to transform eq .",
    "( [ class ] ) into the form of eq .",
    "corresponding to the harmonic oscillator with the solution    [ xp ] @xmath40,\\label{x}\\\\ p(t)&=p_0(t(t))=\\frac{-i}{\\sqrt{2}}\\big[ae^{-if^\\prime(h_0)t}-\\bar{a}e^{if^\\prime(h_0)t}\\big].\\label{p}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that although @xmath41 have the same physical meaning as @xmath42 , they are different functions  @xmath43 is the composition ( in the mathematical sense ) @xmath44 of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we find in eq .",
    "( [ xp ] ) an energy dependent definition of time that yields a different time evolution for each solution to the equations of motion .",
    "( @xmath1 has a different value for each initial condition . )",
    "the orbits in phase space for @xmath1 and @xmath18 are the same taken as non - parametrized curves",
    ". nevertheless , for @xmath1 the curves are parametrized by @xmath25 , whereas for @xmath18 they are parametrized by @xmath47 .",
    "the solutions for @xmath1 all have the same frequency @xmath48 in contrast to those for @xmath18 which have frequencies that depend on the initial conditions ( through the value of @xmath49 ) @xmath50",
    "the behavior of quantum systems is quite different from the classical one .",
    "we choose as a basis for the hilbert space of the harmonic oscillator the states @xmath51 which satisfy @xmath52 .",
    "( in the following we choose units such that @xmath53 . )",
    "every initial state can be expressed as @xmath54 and the evolution is given by : @xmath55 let us consider a hamiltonian defined as @xmath2 . to define @xmath56 for a general self - adjoint operator @xmath57 we must require that @xmath19 satisfy the relevant conditions for the spectral theorems .",
    "@xcite in our case any function defined on the spectrum of @xmath3 would give rise to a well defined hamiltonian , but because we want to discuss the semiclassical limit , we will require that @xmath19 be differentiable .",
    "the eigenvectors @xmath51 of the hamiltonian @xmath58 are also eigenvectors of @xmath5 with eigenvalues @xmath59 .",
    "the evolution of a state @xmath60 defined by @xmath5 is given by @xmath61 from @xmath62 by a simple    reparametrization of time , even if we allow it to depend on the initial state vector @xmath60 , because the relative phases between different energy eigenstates @xmath51 change in time and produce a non - trivial difference between the wave functions under the evolution defined by @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "once we know the exact classical evolution of any state , we can search for semiclassical states that evolve in the same way . in general ,",
    "even for the harmonic oscillator , wave packets ( more specifically their squared modulus ) change shape as they evolve in time.@xcite however , there is a family of non - stationary coherent states whose wave function @xmath63 ( modulus squared ) does not change its shape as time evolves . a plot of @xmath64 as a function of time shows that it rigidly moves back and forth as a particle subject to a restoring force proportional to the distance to a fixed point in space , that is , a classical harmonic oscillator with hamiltonian @xmath65 ( see fig .  [ coherent ] ) .",
    "these coherent states of the harmonic oscillator ( and their free field counterparts ) have a number of additional interesting properties including the following@xcite :    1 .",
    "they are eigenstates of the annihilation operator that can be written in terms of the position and momentum operators as @xmath66 with _ complex _ eigenvalue @xmath33 whose real and imaginary parts encode the initial position and momenta of the classical motion . in terms of @xmath33 and its complex conjugate @xmath67",
    "we have @xmath68 and @xmath69 . if we start with the condition that @xmath70 is an eigenstate of @xmath10 , it is straightforward to express @xmath70 in terms of the energy eigenstates @xmath51 : @xmath71 2 .",
    "the dispersion of the position and momentum operators in these states @xmath72 = [ \\langle z|\\hat{p}^2|z\\rangle-\\langle z|\\hat{p}|z\\rangle^2]=\\frac{1}{2}$ ] are constant and saturate the heisenberg uncertainty inequalities ( coherent states define minimal wave packets ) .",
    "it can be seen that coherent states are also minimal with respect to energy and momentum @xcite in the sense that @xmath73 , the characteristic time of the system in the state @xmath70 is @xmath74 , and then @xmath75 .",
    "the time evolution of the state @xmath76 is given by @xmath77 this equation means that as time evolves , the unitary ray defined by a coherent state @xmath76 at @xmath29 ( i.e. the set of vectors of the form @xmath78 with @xmath79 ) remains coherent at any time @xmath25 and is labeled by @xmath80 where the functions @xmath45 and @xmath81 , given by eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) , are the position and momentum of the classical harmonic oscillator as a function of time . 4 .",
    "the set of coherent states defines a linear , non - orthonormal , overcomplete basis of the hilbert space for a harmonic oscillator .",
    "in particular , we can find a relation of the type @xmath82 as we can see , the coherent states for the harmonic oscillator satisfy a set of properties that allow us to consider them as semiclassical in the sense that their time evolution closely follows the classical one .",
    "they also satisfy interesting properties that render them an important tool in the study of oscillator systems or free field theories .",
    "as an illustration of these methods , we will answer the question : can we build appropriate coherent states for a one - particle system with a hamiltonian of the form    @xmath18 with @xmath65 ?",
    "this case is interesting because if the answer were affirmative , it could be possible to extend the result for interesting field theories such as general relativity reductions of the einstein - rosen type .",
    "as we will see the answer to this question is in the negative .",
    "we show that it is not possible to build proper coherent states for @xmath18 by proving that under time evolution the label @xmath33 , which encodes the initial data , can not evolve according to the classical dynamics dictated by @xmath18 . in terms of the initial data @xmath83 ( combined in the complex number @xmath84 ) , the classical evolution of the system is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) @xmath85 so we will require that the state , which we will also label @xmath70 in analogy with the usual coherent states , evolve as @xmath86 equation   is similar to eq .",
    "( [ evolz ] ) .",
    "note that we must work with unitary rays so we include an arbitrary phase @xmath87 .",
    "we now expand @xmath70 in the orthonormal basis provided by the energy eigenfunctions @xmath51 of the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian @xmath88 where the coefficients @xmath89 are taken as differentiable functions .",
    "equation  ( [ evolfpsiz ] ) becomes @xmath90\\psi_n(z\\exp(-itf^{\\prime}(|z|^2/2 ) ) ) .",

    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the left - hand side of eq .",
    "does not depend on time , so the time derivative of the right - hand side must be zero .",

    "it can be easily checked that for the usual harmonic oscillator , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , the choice @xmath106 gives @xmath107 .",
    "the latter can be written as @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is a branch of the argument of @xmath33 . with this choice",
    "@xmath110 is independent of the branch chosen for the argument , and we can write @xmath111 with @xmath112 .",
    "this result should be compared with the result @xmath113 corresponding to the harmonic oscillator coherent states . as we can see only part of the dependence on @xmath33",
    "is fixed by eq .  , but the result is compatible with @xmath113 . by using the other conditions the full dependence on @xmath33 can be obtained .    from eq .",
    "( [ solution ] ) we observe that , in general , the result will depend on the branch chosen .",
    "this ambiguity is unacceptable so we conclude that it is usually impossible to have a family of coherent states satisfying a condition equivalent to eq .   for the evolution given by @xmath18 .",

    "we have described the classical and quantum dynamics of systems with hamiltonians that are functions of other solvable hamiltonians and compared the cases @xmath1 and @xmath18 .",
    "classically the states evolve in very similar ways and follow the same phase space orbits although with different time parametrizations .",
    "in contrast , their quantum evolution is qualitatively different due to the appearance of non - trivial relative phases .",
