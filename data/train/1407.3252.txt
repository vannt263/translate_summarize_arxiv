    "accurate and reliable forecasting of wind speed is of importance in various field of economy , e.g. , agriculture , transportation , energy production .",
    "forecasts are usually based on current observational data and mathematical models describing the dynamical and physical behaviour of the atmosphere .",
    "these models consist of sets of coupled hydro - thermodynamic non - linear partial differential equations which have only numerical solutions and highly depend on initial conditions .",
    "to reduce the uncertainties coming either from the lack of reliable initial conditions or from the numerical weather prediction process itself , a possible solution is to run the models with different initial conditions resulting in an ensemble of forecasts @xcite . since",
    "its first operational implementation @xcite the ensemble method has become a widely used technique all over the world .",
    "one of the leading organizations issuing ensemble forecasts is the european centre for medium - range weather forecasts @xcite , but all major national meteorological services have their own ensemble prediction systems ( eps ) , e.g. , the cosmo - de eps of the german meteorological service ( dwd ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or the pearp eps of mteo france @xcite . besides calculating the classical point forecasts ( e.g. ensemble mean or ensemble median ) using a forecast ensemble one can also estimate the distribution of a future weather variable which allows probabilistic forecasting @xcite .",
    "however , the forecast ensemble is usually under - dispersive and as a consequence , uncalibrated .",
    "this phenomenon has been observed with several operational ensemble prediction systems ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a possible solution to account for this deficiency is statistical post - processing",
    ".    from the various modern post - processing techniques ( for an overview see , e.g. , @xcite ) probably the most widely used methods are the bayesian model averaging ( bma ) introduced by @xcite and the ensemble model output statistics ( emos ) or non - homogeneous regression technique , suggested by @xcite , as they are implemented in ensemblebma @xcite and ensemblemos packages of r. both approaches provide estimates of the densities of the predictable weather quantities and once a predictive density is given , a point forecast can be easily determined ( e.g. , mean or median value ) .",
    "the bma predictive probability density function ( pdf ) of a future weather quantity is the weighted sum of individual pdfs corresponding to the ensemble members .",
    "an individual pdf can be interpreted as the conditional pdf of the future weather quantity provided the considered forecast is the best one and the weights are based on the relative performance of the ensemble members during a given training period . in the case of wind speed",
    "@xcite suggest the use of a gamma mixture while @xcite considers bma component pdfs following a truncated normal ( tn ) rule .",
    "the emos approach uses a single parametric distribution as a predictive pdf with parameters depending on the ensemble members .",
    "the unknown parameters specifying this dependence are estimated using forecasts and validating observations from a rolling training period , which allows automatic adjustments of the statistical model to any changes of the eps system ( for instance seasonal variations or eps model updates ) . for wind speed",
    "@xcite suggest to use a tn distribution , while @xcite consider a generalized extreme value ( gev ) distributed predictive pdf . to ensure a more accurate prediction of high wind speed values the authors also introduce a tn - gev regime - switching model where the use of the two distributions depend on the value of the ensemble median : for large values a gev , otherwise a tn based emos model is applied .    in the present paper",
    "we develop an emos model where the predictive pdf follows a log - normal ( ln ) distribution . besides this ,",
    "similar to @xcite , we propose a tn - ln regime - switching mixture model , where an ln distribution is applied to high wind speed values and the choice again depends on the ensemble median .",
    "compared to the gev distribution approach of @xcite the main advantage of the ln model is its computational simplicity , which allows faster estimation of model parameters .",
    "the predictive performance of the ln model and of the tn - ln mixture model is tested on forecasts of maximal wind speed of the eight - member university of washington mesoscale ensemble ( uwme , see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and of the ecmwf ensemble @xcite , and on instantaneous wind speed forecasts produced by the operational limited area model ensemble prediction system of the hungarian meteorological service ( hms ) called aladin - huneps @xcite .",
    "these three ensemble prediction systems ( eps ) differ both in the generation of ensemble forecasts and in the predictable wind quantities . as benchmarks in all case studies",
    "we investigate the goodness of fit of the tn model of @xcite and of the gev and tn - gev mixture models of @xcite .",
    "the eight members of the uwme are obtained from different runs of the fifth generation pennsylvania state university  national center for atmospheric research mesoscale model ( psu - ncar mm5 ) with initial conditions from different sources @xcite .",
    "the eps covers the pacific northwest region of western north america providing forecasts on a 12 km grid .",
    "our data base ( identical to the one used in @xcite ) contains ensembles of 48 h forecasts and corresponding validating observations of 10 m maximal wind speed ( maximum of the hourly instantaneous wind speeds over the previous twelve hours , given in m / s , see e.g. @xcite ) for 152 stations in the automated surface observing network @xcite in the states of washington , oregon , idaho , california and nevada in the united states .",
    "the forecasts are initialized at 0 utc ( 5 pm local time when daylight saving time ( dst ) is in use and 4 pm otherwise ) and the generation of the ensemble ensures that its members are not exchangeable . in the present study",
    "we investigate only forecasts for calendar year 2008 with additional data from the last month of 2007 used for parameter estimation .",
    "standard quality control procedures were applied to the data set and after removing days and locations with missing data 101 stations remain where the number of days for which forecasts and validating observations are available varies between 160 and 291 .        to 12cm(a ) ( b ) ( c )    figure [ fig : fig1]a shows the verification rank histogram of the raw ensemble , that is the histogram of ranks of validating observations with respect to the corresponding ensemble forecasts computed from the ranks at all locations and dates considered ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* section 7.7.2 ) .",
    "this histogram is strongly u - shaped as in many cases the ensemble members either underepredict or overpredict the validating observations .",
    "the reliability index  @xmath0   where  @xmath1  denotes the number of classes in the histogram , each of which has expected relative frequency  @xmath2 ,  and  @xmath3  denotes the observed relative frequency in class  @xmath4 , can be used to quantify the deviation of the rank distribution from uniformity @xcite . for the uwme ensemble ,",
    "@xmath5  equals @xmath6 , and the ensemble range contains the observed maximal wind speed in only @xmath7 of the cases ( the nominal value of this coverage equals @xmath8 , i.e @xmath9 ) .",
    "hence , the ensemble is under - dispersive , thus uncalibrated , and would require statistical post - processing to yield an improved forecast probability density function .",
    "the global ensemble prediction system of the ecmwf consists of 50 exchangeable ensemble members which are generated from random perturbations in initial conditions and stochastic physics parametrization @xcite .",
    "forecasts of near - surface ( 10 meter ) wind speed for lead times up to 10 days ahead are issued twice a day at 00 utc and 12 utc , with a horizontal resolution of about 33 km .",
    "following @xcite , we focus on the ecmwf ensemble run initialized at 00 utc ( 2 am local time when dst operates and 1 am otherwise ) and one day ahead forecasts .",
    "predictions of daily maximum wind speed are obtained as the daily maximum of each ensemble member at each grid point location .",
    "the verification is performed over a set of 228 synoptic observation stations over germany .",
    "the validating observations are hourly observations of 10-minute average wind speed measured over the 10 minutes before the hour .",
    "daily maximum wind speed observations are given by the maximum over the 24 hours corresponding to the time frame of the ensemble forecast .",
    "ensemble forecasts at individual station locations are obtained by bilinear interpolation of the gridded model output .",
    "our results are based on a verification period from may 1 , 2010 to april 30 , 2011 , consisting of 83220 individual forecast cases .",
    "additional data from february 1 , 2010 to april 30 , 2011 are used to allow for training periods of equal lengths for all days in the verification period and for model selection purposes .",
    "the verification rank histogram of the ecmwf ensemble displayed in figure [ fig : fig1]b is even more u - shaped than that of the uwme resulting in a reliability index of @xmath10 , while the ensemble range contains the validating observation just in @xmath11 of all cases ( here the nominal value is @xmath12 , that is @xmath13 ) .",
    "again , the ensemble is under - dispersive and statistical calibration is required .",
    "the aladin - huneps system of the hms covers a large part of continental europe with a horizontal resolution of 12 km and is obtained with dynamical downscaling ( by the aladin limited area model ) of the global arpege based pearp system of mto france @xcite .",
    "the ensemble consists of 11 members , 10 initialized from perturbed initial conditions and one control member from the unperturbed analysis , implying that the ensemble contains groups of exchangeable forecasts .",
    "the data base contains 11 member ensembles of 42 hour forecasts for 10 meter instantaneous wind speed ( given in m / s ) for 10 major cities in hungary ( miskolc , szombathely , gyr , budapest , debrecen , nyregyhza , nagykanizsa , pcs , kecskemt , szeged ) produced by the aladin - huneps system of the hms , together with the corresponding validating observations for the one - year period between april 1 , 2012 and march 31 , 2013 .",
    "the validating observations were scrutinized by basic quality control algorithms including , e.g. , consistency checks .",
    "the forecasts are initialized at 18 utc ( 8 pm local time when dst operates and 7 pm otherwise ) .",
    "the data set is fairly complete since there are only six days when no forecasts are available .",
    "these dates are excluded from the analysis .",
    "similar to the previous two examples , the verification rank histogram of the raw aladin - huneps ensemble is far from the desired uniform distribution ( see figure [ fig : fig1]c ) , however , it shows a less under - dispersive character .",
    "the better fit of the ensemble can also be observed on its reliability index of @xmath14 and coverage value of @xmath15 , where the latter should be compared to the nominal coverage of @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the emos predictive pdf of a univariate weather quantity is a single parametric density function , where the parameters depend on the ensemble members . in case of temperature and pressure",
    "the normal distribution is a reasonable choice @xcite , while for non - negative variables such as wind speed , a skewed distribution is required .",
    "a popular candidate is the weibull distribution ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , gamma or log - normal distributions are also in use @xcite , while @xcite suggested an emos model based on truncated normal distribution with a cut - off at zero .",
    "let  @xmath18  denote the ensemble of distinguishable forecasts of wind speed for a given location and time .",
    "this means that each ensemble member can be identified and tracked , which holds for example for the uwme ( see section [ subs : subs2.1 ] ) .    however , most of the currently used ensemble prediction systems incorporate ensembles where at least some members are statistically indistinguishable .",
    "such ensemble systems are usually producing initial conditions based on algorithms , which are able to find the fastest growing perturbations indicating the directions of the largest uncertainties . in most cases these initial perturbations",
    "are further enriched by perturbations simulating model uncertainties as well .",
    "examples in the paper at hand are the ecmwf ensemble and the aladin - huneps ensemble described in sections [ subs : subs2.2 ] and [ subs : subs2.3 ] , respectively . in such cases",
    "one usually has a control member ( the one without any perturbation ) and the remaining ensemble members forming one or two exchangeable groups .    in what follows ,",
    "if we have  @xmath19  ensemble members divided into  @xmath20  exchangeable groups , where the  @xmath21th  group contains  @xmath22  ensemble members ( @xmath23 ) ,  notation  @xmath24  is used for the @xmath25th member of the @xmath21th group .",
    "denote by  @xmath26  the tn distribution with location  @xmath27 ,  scale  @xmath28 ,  and cut - off at zero having pdf @xmath29 where  @xmath30  and  @xmath31  are the pdf and the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the standard normal distribution , respectively .",
    "the emos predictive distribution of wind speed  @xmath32  proposed by @xcite is @xmath33 where  @xmath34  denotes the ensemble mean .",
    "location parameters  @xmath35  and scale parameters  @xmath36  of model can be estimated from the training data consisting of ensemble members and verifying observations from the preceding  @xmath37  days , by optimizing an appropriate verification score ( see section [ subs : subs3.5 ] ) .",
    "if the ensemble can be divided into groups of exchangeable members , ensemble members within a given group will get the same coefficient of the location parameter @xcite resulting in a predictive distribution of the form @xmath38 where again ,  @xmath39  denotes the ensemble variance .",
    "one might think of taking into account the grouping also in modelling the variance of the predictive pdf and use , e.g. , the variance of the group means instead of the ensemble variance  @xmath39 .",
    "however , practical tests show that this ( smaller ) variance results in reduction of the predictive skill of the model .      as an alternative to the tn model of section [ subs : subs3.1 ] we propose an emos approach based on an ln distribution .",
    "this distribution has a heavier upper tail , and in this way it is more appropriate to model high wind speed values .",
    "the pdf of the ln distribution  @xmath40  with location  @xmath27  and shape  @xmath28  is @xmath41 while the mean  @xmath20  and variance  @xmath42  of this distribution are @xmath43 further , since @xmath44 an ln distribution can also be parametrized by these quantities . in our",
    "emos approach  @xmath20  and  @xmath42  are affine functions of the ensemble members and ensemble variance , respectively , that is @xmath45 similar to the tn model , to obtain the values of mean and variance parameters  @xmath46  and  @xmath47 ,  respectively , one has to perform an optimum score estimation based on some verification measure . obviously , for the case of exchangeable ensemble members instead of we have @xmath48      to combine the advantageous properties of tn and ln approaches , following @xcite , we also investigate a regime - switching method .",
    "depending on the value of the ensemble median  @xmath49 we consider either a tn or an ln based emos model .",
    "given a threshold  @xmath50 ,  the emos predictive distribution is  @xmath51  if  @xmath52 and  @xmath53 , otherwise . model parameters  @xmath54  and  @xmath55 depend on the ensemble forecast according to or , while the expressions for  @xmath56  and @xmath57  can be obtained form or via transformation .",
    "for training the combined model we propose two different methods .",
    "if the training data set is large enough , that is many forecast cases belong to each day to be investigated , the ln model is trained using only ensemble forecasts where @xmath58 ,   while forecasts with ensemble median under the threshold are used to train the tn model .",
    "this technique is applied for calibrating the uwme and the ecmwf ensemble forecasts , see sections [ subs : subs4.1 ] and [ subs : subs4.2 ] , respectively . however , e.g. , in case of the aladin - huneps ensemble one has only 10 observation stations , so there are not enough data for separate training of the component models . in such situations",
    "one might utilize the same training data set both for the tn and for the ln predictive distribution and then choose between these two models according to the value of the ensemble median .",
    "this particular idea is applied in section [ subs : subs4.3 ] for the aladin - huneps forecasts .      in section [ sec : sec4 ] the predictive performances of the ln and tn - ln mixture models are compared to those of the gev and tn - gev mixture models of @xcite .",
    "the cdf of a gev distribution @xmath59  with location  @xmath60 , scale  @xmath28  and shape  @xmath61  equals @xmath62^{-1/\\xi}\\big ) , & \\",
    "\\xi\\ne 0 ; \\\\",
    "\\exp\\big(-\\exp\\big(-\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\big)\\big ) , & \\ \\xi= 0 , \\end{cases}\\ ] ] if  @xmath63 ,  and zero otherwise .",
    "this definition shows the main disadvantage of using a gev distribution for modelling wind speed , namely , there is a positive probability for a gev distributed random variable to be negative .    for calibrating ecmwf ensemble forecasts of wind speed over germany @xcite",
    "suggest to model location and scale parameters by @xmath64 while the shape parameter  @xmath61  is considered to be independent of the ensemble .",
    "in general , one can also incorporate the ensemble variance into the models of location and scale .",
    "however , preliminary studies showed that model is also a reasonable choice for the uwme and the aladin - huneps ensemble .",
    "further , the components of the tn - gev mixture model for the various ensemble forecasts are trained as described in section [ eq : eq3.2 ] .",
    "the aim of probabilistic forecasting is to obtain calibrated and sharp predictive distributions of future weather quantities @xcite .",
    "this goal should also be addressed in the choice of the scoring rule to be optimized in order to obtain the estimates of parameters of different emos models .",
    "for evaluating density forecasts the most popular scoring rules are the logarithmic score @xcite , i.e. the negative logarithm of the predictive pdf evaluated at the verifying observation , and the continuous ranked probability score ( crps ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given a predictive cdf  @xmath65  and an observation  @xmath66 ,  the crps is defined as @xmath67 where  @xmath68  denotes the indicator of a set  @xmath69 , while  @xmath32  and  @xmath70  are independent random variables with cdf @xmath71  and finite first moment .",
    "we remark that the crps can be expressed in the same unit as the observation . both the logarithmic score and the crps are proper scoring rules which are negatively oriented , that is , the smaller the better . in this way the optimization with respect to the logarithmic score gives back the maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimates of the parameters .",
    "short calculation shows that the crps corresponding to the cdf @xmath72  of a tn distribution   @xmath26  can be given in a closed form ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , namely @xmath73^{-2}&\\ ,   \\bigg[\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma } \\phi\\big(\\mu/\\sigma\\big ) \\big ( 2 \\phi\\big((x-\\mu)/\\sigma\\big)+\\phi\\big(\\mu/\\sigma\\big)-2\\big ) \\\\ & + 2\\varphi\\big((y-\\mu)/\\sigma\\big)\\phi\\big(\\mu/\\sigma\\big )   -\\frac 1{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\phi\\big(\\sqrt{2}\\mu/\\sigma\\big)\\bigg ] .",

    "obviously , with the help of transformations ,   @xmath77  can also be expressed as a function of the mean  @xmath20  and variance  @xmath42  of the ln distribution @xmath40 .",
    "now , following the ideas of @xcite and @xcite , both for the tn and the ln model we estimate model parameters by minimizing the mean crps of the predictive distributions and validating observations corresponding to the forecast cases of the training period , while for the gev model the ml method suggested by @xcite is applied .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the predictive performances of the ln model and of the tn - ln combined model ( see sections [ subs : subs3.2 ] and [ subs : subs3.3 ] , respectively ) are tested on the eight - member uwme , on the fifty - member ecmwf ensemble and on the aladin - huneps ensemble of the hms .",
    "the obtained results are compared to the fits of the tn , gev and tn - gev combined models investigated by @xcite , and to the verification scores of the raw ensemble .",
    "we also consider the scores corresponding to climatological forecasts which can be defined as forecasts calculated from observations in the training period used as an ensemble .",
    "the goodness of fit of a calibrated forecast in terms of probability distributions is quantified with the help of the mean crps defined in section [ subs : subs3.4 ] . for the raw ensemble and climatology in the empirical cdf",
    "replaces the emos predictive cdf . in order to evaluate forecasts for high wind speeds",
    "we also consider the threshold - weighted continuous ranked probability score ( twcrps ) @xmath78 introduced by @xcite , where  @xmath79  is a weight function .",
    "obviously , case  @xmath80  corresponds to the traditional crps defined by , while to address wind speeds above a given threshold  @xmath81  one may set  @xmath82 .  in our study",
    "we consider threshold values approximately corresponding to the 90th , 95th and 99th percentiles of the wind speed observations .",
    "further , in order to quantify the improvement in twcrps with respect to a reference predictive cdf  @xmath83  we make use of the threshold - weighted continuous ranked probability skill score ( twcrpss ) defined as ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath84 this score is obviously positively oriented , and as a reference we always use the predictive cdf corresponding to the tn model .",
    "finally , for each emos model we investigate the coverage and average width of the central prediction interval corresponding to the nominal coverage of the raw ensemble ( uwme : @xmath85 ; ecmwf : @xmath13 ; aladin - huneps : @xmath16 ) , where the coverage of a  @xmath86  central prediction interval is the proportion of validating observations located between the lower and upper  @xmath87  quantiles of the predictive distribution . for a calibrated predictive pdf",
    "this value should be around  @xmath88  and the proposed choices of  @xmath89  allow direct comparisons to the raw ensembles .",
    "a continuous counterpart of the verification rank histogram ( see figure [ fig : fig1 ] ) of the raw ensemble is the probability integral transform ( pit ) histogram of the predictive distribution .",
    "the pit is the value of the predictive cdf evaluated at the verifying observation @xcite , and the pit histogram provides a good measure about the possible improvements of the under - dispersive character of the raw ensemble .",
    "the closer the histogram is to the uniform distribution , the better is the calibration .    as point forecasts we consider emos and ensemble medians and means , which are evaluated with the use of mean absolute errors ( maes ) and root mean squared errors ( rmses ) . note that mae is optimal for the median , while rmse is optimal for the mean forecasts @xcite .          as the eight members of the uwme are non - exchangeable , the dependencies of location and scale parameters of the tn and gev models on the ensemble members are specified by , , respectively , while the mean and variance of the ln model are linked to the ensemble according to .",
    "as a first step we determine the optimal length of the rolling training period valid for all models and the optimal threshold values for tn - ln and tn - gev mixtures .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2]a shows the mean crps values of all three models as functions of the training period length varying from 15 to 40 days .",
    "the mean crps of the gev model takes its minimum at day 30 and this training period length seems reasonable for the other two models , too .",
    "this particular length of the training period is also supported by figure [ fig : fig2]b showing the mean crps values of the tn - ln mixture model as function of the threshold  @xmath90  for various training period lengths . for this mixture model",
    "the optimal threshold is @xmath91 m / s , while for the tn - gev models similar arguments lead us to a threshold of @xmath92 m / s , see figure [ fig : fig2]c . using these parameter values ensemble forecasts for the calendar year 2008",
    "are calibrated . in case of the two regime - switching models an ln distribution",
    "is used in around one third , while a gev distribution is applied in about 40% of the 27481 individual forecast cases .",
    ".mean crps , mean twcrps for various thresholds  @xmath81 ,  mae of median and rmse of mean forecasts and coverage and average width of @xmath85 central prediction intervals for the uwme .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     similar to sections [ subs : subs4.1 ] and [ subs : subs4.2 ] in table [ tab : tab4 ] verification scores for probabilistic forecasts and the average width and coverage of @xmath16 central prediction intervals are reported . compared to the raw ensemble and to climatology post - processed forecasts show the same behaviour as before : improved predictive skills and better calibration .",
    "the lowest crps and rmse values belong to the tn - gev mixture model , while the tn - ln regime - switching method provides the best mae score and coverage combined with a rather narrow central prediction interval .",
    "further , for @xmath93 m / s and @xmath94 m / s threshold values the gev and tn - gev models result in slightly lower twcrps scores than the tn - ln mixture , while for @xmath95 m / s this advantage practically disappears .",
    "this phenomenon can also be observed in figure [ fig : fig10 ] showing the twcrpss values of the gev , ln , tn - gev and tn - ln methods with respect to the reference tn model as functions of the threshold .",
    "finally , the mean ( maximal ) probabilities of predicting a negative wind speed by the gev and tn - gev methods are @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) and @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) , respectively .",
    "taking also into account the goodness of fit of pit histograms ( see table [ tab : tab3 ] ) one can conclude that for aladin - huneps wind speed forecasts the tn - ln mixture model has the best overall performance .",
    "we introduce a new emos model for calibrating ensemble forecasts of wind speed providing a predictive pdf which follows a log - normal distribution . in order to have better forecasts in the tails we also consider a regime - switching approach based on the ensemble median , which considers a truncated normal emos model for low values and a log - normal emos for the high ones .",
    "the two approaches are tested on wind speed forecasts of the eight - member university of washington mesoscale ensemble , of the fifty - member ecmwf ensemble and of the eleven - member aladin - huneps ensemble of the hungarian meteorological service .",
    "these ensemble prediction systems differ both in the wind speed quantities being forecasted and in the generation of the ensemble members . using appropriate verification measures ( crps of probabilistic , mae of median and rmse of mean forecasts , coverage and average width of central prediction intervals corresponding to the nominal coverage , twcrps corresponding to 90th , 95th and 99th percentiles of the verifying observations ) the predictive performances of the ln and tn - ln mixture models",

    "<S> ensembles of forecasts are obtained from multiple runs of numerical weather forecasting models with different initial conditions and typically employed to account for forecast uncertainties . however </S>",
    "<S> , biases and dispersion errors often occur in forecast ensembles , they are usually under - dispersive and uncalibrated and require statistical post - processing . </S>",
    "<S> we present an ensemble model output statistics ( emos ) method for calibration of wind speed forecasts based on the log - normal ( ln ) distribution , and we also show a regime - switching extension of the model which combines the previously studied truncated normal ( tn ) distribution with the ln .    both presented models are applied to wind speed forecasts of the eight - member university of washington mesoscale ensemble , of the fifty - member ecmwf ensemble and of the eleven - member aladin - huneps ensemble of the hungarian meteorological service , and their predictive performances are compared to those of the tn and general extreme value ( gev ) distribution based emos methods and to the tn - gev mixture model . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicate improved calibration of probabilistic and accuracy of point forecasts in comparison to the raw ensemble and to climatological forecasts . </S>",
    "<S> further , the tn - ln mixture model outperforms the traditional tn method and its predictive performance is able to keep up with the models utilizing the gev distribution without assigning mass to negative values .    _ </S>",
