    "he0450 - 2958 is a bright quasar at redshift @xmath1 .",
    "hst images revealed that the system is double , with an ultra - luminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) situated @xmath2 arcsec from the quasar @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite reported that the host galaxy of the quasar is substantially under - luminous , based on the quasar s luminosity and on a likely value for @xmath3 , the mass of its nuclear supermassive black hole ( sbh ) .",
    "magain et al . proposed either that the quasar host galaxy is dark , or that an otherwise `` naked '' sbh had acquired gas while moving through intergalactic space .    here",
    "we examine these hypotheses in light of additional evidence from the spectra of the quasar and the companion galaxy .",
    "the quasar spectrum reveals it to be a typical narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy @xcite , not a giant elliptical galaxy as assumed by @xcite .",
    "we infer a much smaller luminosity for the host galaxy , consistent with the upper limits derived by those authors .",
    "we also critically examine the most natural model for a `` naked '' sbh , namely , a sbh that was ejected from the companion galaxy during the merger that created the ulirg @xcite .",
    "we show that the ejection model can be securely ruled out , since the quasar spectrum indicates the presence of narrow emission line gas extending out to a distance of @xmath4 kpc from the nucleus that is moving at the same velocity as the broad - line gas .",
    "the narrow - line gas could not have remained bound to the sbh if it were ejected from the companion galaxy .",
    "he0450 - 2958 was observed during november 27 2001 using the uv focal reducer and low - dispersion spectrograph ( fors1 ) on unit telescope 1 of the vlt ( pi : m. courbin ) .",
    "the instrument was operated in mos mode with a long - slit position angle of @xmath5 .",
    "this allowed the contributions from the ulirg , quasar and the nearby g - type star to be gathered simultaneously in slit no .",
    "9 . in total ,",
    "five spectra were obtained of he0450 - 2958 : three of 1200 s duration using the 600b grism centered at 4620 , and two of 1800 s duration using the 600r ( 6270 ) and 600i ( 7940 ) grisms .",
    "these data , including all relevant calibration files , were retrieved from the vlt data archive .",
    "the data were reduced using standard iraf routines .",
    "bias and flat - field subtraction were carried out before wavelength calibration with hearne arcs .",
    "cosmic ray subtraction was facilitated with a median combine , in the case of the three 600b exposures , and with a median filter and rigorous visual inspection in the 600r and 600i cases .",
    "background subtraction was performed by removing a third - order polynomial fitted to the sky components in the spatial direction .",
    "flux calibration was carried out by fitting a 5700k ( g - type ) black body spectrum to the observed star , and scaling to the fluxes observed through the high resolution channel of the advanced camera for surveys aboard the _ hubble space telescope _",

    "figure  [ fig : kin ] shows the velocities derived from the peak wavelengths of the strongest emission lines along the slit ; the regions dominated by the ulirg , the quasar and the @xcite `` blob '' are indicated . in the region dominated by the galaxy ,",
    "the velocities show the pattern of a rotation curve , with peak - to - peasuch a k amplitude of @xmath6 km s@xmath7 .",
    "this value seems small for such a luminous galaxy , but the hst image suggests that the orientation of the slit , aligned to include the star , quasar and ulirg , is far from the major axis of the galaxy . according to the rotation curve , the systemic velocity of the galaxy is 73950@xmath820kms@xmath7 . in the region dominated by the quasar , the velocities obtained from the h@xmath9 , h@xmath10 ,",
    "[ nii]@xmath116584 and [ sii]@xmath116717 emission lines do not vary within the uncertainties , and the average value is 73920@xmath820kms@xmath7 , indicating a blueshift relative to the systemic velocity of the galaxy of only 30kms@xmath7 , consistent within the errors with zero . the [ oiii]@xmath115007 emission line is blue - shifted relative to the other emission lines by approximately 60kms@xmath7 .",
    "however such a blueshift in [ oiii]@xmath115007 is often observed in agn @xcite . in the region dominated by the emission of the blob , this blueshift",
    "is not observed , and the velocities derived from the [ oiii ] emission line are the same as those obtained from the other lines . in summary ,",
    "our measurements show similar systemic velocities for the ulirg , quasar and blob .",
    "the blue spectrum of the galaxy ( figure  [ fig : synthesis ] ) shows a number of absorption - line features , in particular , high - order balmer lines indicative of an intermediate - age ( @xmath12yr ) stellar population . in order to better quantify the age of the stellar population and to obtain an estimate for the stellar velocity dispersion",
    ", we performed a spectral synthesis using the code starlight of @xcite .",
    "this code uses a basis of stellar population templates , each one corresponding to a given metallicity and age , to synthesize the galaxy spectrum , and it gives as output the contribution of each template to the total light at @xmath114020 ; the internal reddening ; and the velocity dispersion .",
    "the contribution of the quasar , which contaminates both the continuum and the emission lines of the galaxy spectrum , has also been included in the synthesis .",
    "the results of the synthesis ( figure 2 ) yield the following contributions to the light of the ulirg at @xmath114020 : @xmath1325% from the quasar continuum , @xmath1350% from stars with ages around @xmath14yr and @xmath1325% from older stars .",
    "the total stellar mass is @xmath15 , with the major uncertainty due to the quasar continuum contribution .",
    "the internal reddening is a@xmath16=0.4 mag and the velocity dispersion is @xmath17 kms@xmath7 .",
    "the synthesis strongly points to a major burst of star formation @xmath18yr ago .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the low luminosity of the quasar host , coupled with its proximity to a ulirg , leads naturally to the hypothesis that the sbh powering the quasar was ejected from the ulirg following a merger .",
    "two ejection mechanisms have been discussed : gravitational radiation recoil during the coalescence of a binary sbh @xcite ; or a gravitational slingshot involving three sbhs , if the merger happened to bring a third sbh into the center of a galaxy containing an uncoalesced binary @xcite .",
    "the quasar is displaced @xmath19 arcsec from the center of the ulirg , corresponding to a projected separation of @xmath20 kpc .",
    "this is much greater than the galaxy s half - light radius implying an ejection velocity @xmath21 comparable to the central escape velocity from the galaxy @xmath22 . the distribution of mass around the companion galaxy of he0450 - 2958 is unknown .",
    "however , @xcite find that the light distributions in a sample of 18 ulirgs are reasonably well fit by de vaucouleurs profiles with effective ( projected half - light ) radii of @xmath23 kpc , similar to those of luminous e galaxies .",
    "they derive kinematical masses of @xmath24 , consistent with the estimate presented above from population synthesis of @xmath25 .",
    "the mean stellar velocity dispersion in their sample is @xmath26 km s@xmath7 , consistent with the population synthesis estimates presented above .",
    "we accordingly modelled the baryonic mass distribution around the ulirg as if it were a normal , spherical e galaxy of mass @xmath27 , and used the empirical correlations between e - galaxy mass , luminosity , effective radius and sersic index @xcite to derive its gravitational potential .",
    "table  [ tab:1 ] gives the parameters of two mass models for the companion galaxy .",
    "model 1 has a baryonic mass of @xmath28 , roughly the mass of a @xmath29 de galaxy and a factor of @xmath13two _ smaller _ than the smallest ulirg mass inferred by tacconi et al .",
    "model 2 has @xmath30 , the stellar mass of a @xmath31 e galaxy , and close to the average mass of the galaxies in the tacconi et al . sample .",
    "we also included a dark - matter halo ; because the contribution of dark matter to the gravitational force on scales @xmath32 kpc is probably much less than that of the baryons , we considered only a single halo model . as templates for the dark matter , we considered the four `` galaxy - sized '' halos in the @xcite @xmath33cdm simulations , which have virial masses in the range @xmath34 . fits to @xmath35 for these halos are given in @xcite ; based on these fits , central escape velocities lie in the range @xmath36 , and the @xmath37 in climbing to @xmath38 kpc is @xmath39 km s@xmath7 .",
    "our adopted halo model ( table  [ tab:1 ] ) had a mass of @xmath40 ( virial mass @xmath41 ) , half - mass radius @xmath42 kpc and central escape velocity @xmath43 km s@xmath7 , similar to model g1 in @xcite . by comparison ,",
    "the virial mass of the milky way halo is believed to be @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "in de vacouleurs - like mass models , the @xmath37 in climbing from the very center out to a distance of a few parsecs can be considerable due to the high nuclear density ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the mass distribution of the companion galaxy following the merger is unknown on these small radial scales , and in any case , the sbh would carry with it the mass of the inner few parsecs , modifying the potential .",
    "accordingly , we placed the sbh initially at a distance of @xmath38 pc from the galaxy center when computing post - ejection trajectories .    ) .",
    "_ black ( thick ) curves : _ model 1 ; _ blue ( thin ) curves : _ model 2 .",
    "curves are labelled by @xmath21 in km s@xmath7.,width=321 ]    figure  [ fig : roft ] shows the results .",
    "as expected , kicks of @xmath43 km s@xmath7 ( model 1 ) and @xmath45 km s@xmath7 ( model 2 ) are required in order for the sbh to climb a distance of @xmath38 kpc from the center of the galaxy .",
    "_ this result essentially rules out radiation recoil as the origin of the kick _ , since the maximum amplitude of the recoil is believed to be less than @xmath46 km s@xmath7 @xcite and probably no more than @xmath47 km s@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "three - body recoils might still work , however the largest @xmath37 in a three - body interaction is experienced by the _",
    "smallest _ body . but figure  [ fig : roft ] constrains _ any _ ejection model in a number of other ways :    \\1 .",
    "a large @xmath21 implies a large velocity , @xmath48 km s@xmath7 , as the sbh moves past its current position .",
    "this is hard to reconcile with the essentially zero radial velocity difference between quasar and galaxy , unless the ejection velocity is fine - tuned or nearly perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "the time for the kicked sbh to reach a distance of @xmath38 kpc is much shorter than @xmath14 yr , again unless the gravitational potential and kick velocity are finely tuned .",
    "but the starburst occurred @xmath18 yr ago ; thus , either the true separation of the sbh from the ulirg is much greater than @xmath38 kpc , or the ejection was delayed until a time of @xmath18 yr after the starburst .",
    "a large @xmath21 implies that the ejected sbh will carry very little mass with it as it departs the galaxy .",
    "material orbiting the sbh with velocity @xmath49 before the kick will experience the kick as an adiabatic perturbation and will `` instantaneously '' acquire the specific momentum of the sbh .",
    "this argument suggests that the sbh will carry with it the mass contained initially within a region whose size is less than @xmath50 , the radius at which the orbital velocity around the sbh is equal to @xmath21 , or @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 km s@xmath7 . since @xmath54 ( see below ) and @xmath55 ( figure  [ fig : roft ] ) , the entrained region will be of order 1 pc or less in size .",
    "this is probably sufficient to include the broad - line region ( blr ) gas , which is expected to have a size @xmath56 pc based on the empirical scaling relation between blr size and @xmath57 luminosity @xcite , but not larger structures .",
    "the radius of the narrow - line region can be estimated from the ionization parameter and density of the emitting gas and the ionizing luminosity of the qso . for an ionizing photon luminosity , @xmath58 , the ionization parameter in gas of density @xmath59 at a distance @xmath60 from the source",
    "can be defined as @xmath61 .",
    "we estimate the ionizing photon luminosity by extrapolating the slope of the far uv ( @xmath62 ) continuum as determined by @xcite from _ fuse _ observations .",
    "after corrections for interstellar extinction and absorption , scott et al.s power - law ( @xmath63 ) fit yields a spectral index @xmath64 and a flux at 1000 of @xmath65ergs@xmath7@xmath66 hz@xmath7 .",
    "he0450 - 2958 has a steep soft x - ray continuum , with a photon index @xmath67 in the 0.1 - 2 kev rosat band @xcite .",
    "therefore , we extrapolate the uv power - law to a high energy cut - off of 0.1 kev . adopting a luminosity distance of 1458 mpc ( assuming @xmath68 kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 and a matter density parameter @xmath69 ) the integration yields @xmath70 photons s@xmath7 .",
    "the gas density was obtained from the relative intensities of the [ sii]@xmath71 doublet .",
    "although partially blended in the spectrum , gaussian fits to the lines are well constrained and yield a ratio @xmath72 .",
    "this corresponds to a density @xmath73  @xmath74 .",
    "we determined the ionization parameter from the ratio of the [ oii]@xmath75 and [ oiii]@xmath76 lines @xcite .",
    "the intensity ratio measured from the spectrum is @xmath77 . using the empirical relation between this ratio and the ionization parameter given by @xcite",
    ", we obtain @xmath78 .",
    "this value is broadly consistent with the more recent photoionization models presented by @xcite .    combining estimates for @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath79",
    ", we arrive at a radius @xmath80 kpc .",
    "this of course represents an ill - defined spatial average , since we have used integrated fluxes of emission lines representing different ionization states .",
    "moreover , the determination of @xmath79 is model - dependent and extrapolating the far uv power - law is , at best , a crude representation of the euv continuum .",
    "photon luminosity is @xmath81 photons s@xmath7 which , assuming photoionization , implies that our value for @xmath58 is _ underestimated _ by at least a factor @xmath82 . ]",
    "based on these considerations , @xmath83 may be uncertain by a factor @xmath84 .",
    "it is , nevertheless , unsurprising that the nlr in a relatively luminous quasar extends to a few kpc . direct imaging of bright , low - redshift quasars in [ oiii ] with hst reveals nlr sizes ranging from 1.5 kpc to 10 kpc @xcite .",
    "indeed , the [ oiii ] luminosity of he0450 - 2958 ( @xmath85 } \\approx 3.6\\times10^{43}$]ergs@xmath7 ) makes it comparable with the most luminous object in bennert et al.s sample , for which they determine an nlr radius of 10.5 kpc .",
    "_ such a large size for the nlr rules out the possibility that the nlr gas would remain bound to the sbh after ejection from the ulirg _ ( cf . equation  [ eq : reff ] ) .",
    "post - ejection accretion of the nlr gas from a cloud is also unlikely , since the radius of the bondi accretion column , @xmath86 , is given by an equation similar to eq .",
    "[ eq : reff ] , after replacing @xmath21 by the relative velocity between sbh and gas cloud , implying @xmath87 kpc unless the ejected sbh has fortuitously matched velocities with the cloud .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : nls1 ] , _ he0450 - 2958 exhibits characteristics which unambiguously identify it as a narrow - line seyfert 1 _ ( nls1 ; @xcite ) . specifically , its broad balmer lines have fwhm s @xmath88kms@xmath7 ( the conventional definition requires fwhm @xmath89kms@xmath7 ; @xcite ) , it has strong optical feii emission features and , as already noted , it has a steep soft x - ray photon continuum .",
    "the currently - favored picture of nls1 s is that they represent an extreme agn population characterized by relatively low - mass sbhs but high accretion rates @xcite  possibly substantially super - eddington @xcite .",
    "it follows that estimating @xmath3 from the quasar luminosity assuming a sub - eddington accretion rate , as was done by @xcite , is likely to be misleading .",
    "here we adopt what we consider to be a more robust approach , and estimate a virial mass based on the velocity dispersion ( @xmath90 ) and radius ( @xmath91 ) of the broad - line region : @xmath92 @xcite .",

    "this requires measurements of the h@xmath10 fwhm ( @xmath94 fwhm ) and the continuum luminosity at 5100(@xmath95 ) .",
    "our measurements of these quantities yield fwhm(h@xmath10 ) @xmath96 kms@xmath7 and @xmath97ergs@xmath7 , respectively . inserting these values into equation ( 5 ) of greene & ho , we obtain @xmath98 .",
    "greene & ho s alternative virial formula , which employs the luminosity and fwhm of the broad h@xmath9 line yields a consistent result , albeit with greater uncertainty : @xmath99 .",
    "these masses are subject to a systematic uncertainty of a factor @xmath82 related to the poorly - known structure , kinematics and aspect of the blr ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    ". while very uncertain , this estimate is @xmath113 magnitudes fainter than @xcite s estimate ( @xmath114 ) based on a @xmath115 larger assumed value of @xmath3 , and consistent with their conclusion that the host galaxy must be at least @xmath116 magnitudes fainter than the quasar ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "the he0450 - 2958 system consists of a ulirg that experienced a major starburst @xmath18 yr ago , situated at @xmath118 kpc projected separation from a quasar having the spectral characteristics of a narrow - line seyfert 1 .",
