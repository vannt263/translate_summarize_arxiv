    "the objective of this paper is a critical review of the identification of light mesons with @xmath8 = @xmath7 and @xmath2 , particularly the separation of @xmath7 states into @xmath9 and @xmath4 .",
    "that detail is important in its own right .",
    "it will also be vital input information into the search for the @xmath7 glueball in radiative @xmath10 decays .",
    "it is unrealistic that those data will be extensive enough to sort out the complex spectroscopy of @xmath11 states as well as glueballs .",
    "section 2 reviews @xmath7 states .",
    "they fall into a regular scheme except for @xmath5 , whose identification is presently weak .",
    "section 3 reviews @xmath2 states and makes the case that @xmath5 may have been confused with @xmath6 . without an @xmath12 in that mass range ,",
    "the @xmath2 spectrum is obviously incomplete , but @xmath6 fits in naturally .",
    "section 4 draws conclusions and comments on improvements needed in present partial wave analyses to resolve this question ; these are straightforward and can be done with existing data and/or forthcoming bes iii data .",
    "there are extensive data from crystal barrel on @xmath14 scattering in flight to 17 final states .",
    "these concern purely neutral final states which can be classified into four families with isospin @xmath0 and 1 , and charge conjugation @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we shall concentrate here on @xmath0 , @xmath15 where the data are most complete .",
    "this is a formation experiment of the type @xmath17 .",
    "these data are listed by the pdg under ` further states ' , requiring confirmation @xcite .",
    "that is not possible for most states because other data come from production reactions of the form @xmath18 ( or n ) , where the exchanged meson is uncertain , leading to ambiguities in partial wave analysis ; also they have no polarisation data .",
    "a combined analysis has been published @xcite of 8 sets of data with @xmath0 , @xmath19 on @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 from crystal barrel at 9 beam momenta , plus measurements of differential cross sections and polarisation from the ps172 experiment @xcite and an earlier experiment of eisenhandler et al . at the cern ps @xcite .",
    "the first set of @xmath24 data covers the momentum range 0.361.55 gev / c and the second covers 12.5 gev / c .",
    "they agree accurately where they overlap .",
    "the data of ps172 are particularly valuable because they extend down to a beam momentum of 360 mev / c ( a mass of 1910 mev ) in quite small steps of momentum ( 30100 mev / c ) and therefore cover in detail the lower side of the cluster of resonances around 2000 mev ; they also used a beam going through the detector and therefore cover centre of mass scattering angles to @xmath25 .",
    "two further analyses were reported of crystal barrel data for @xmath26 @xcite and @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "they find masses and widths consistent within errors with the combined analysis .",
    "the polarisation data are very important . because @xmath28 and @xmath29 have orthogonal clebsch - gordan coefficients , they separate those partial waves accurately .",
    "differential cross sections contain real parts of interferences within singlet and triplet sets of amplitudes ; polarisation data measure the imaginary part of interferences within the triplet set .",
    "formulae are given in ref .",
    "column 5 of table 1 gives the ratio @xmath30 of amplitudes , where @xmath31 are coupling constants for @xmath14 orbital angular momentum @xmath32 ; intensites depend on @xmath33 .",
    "the phase sensitivity of the polarisation data improves greatly the accuracy of masses and widths .",
    "the only singlet states with @xmath0 , @xmath34 are @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 and these states are separated by their angular dependence .",
    "the analysis relies on fitting with analytic functions of @xmath38 and assumes two towers of states in mass ranges 1910 - 2100 and 2200 - 2370 mev ; it includes blatt - weisskopf centrifugal barrier factors with a radius which optimises at @xmath39 fm .",
    "the tails of @xmath40 and @xmath41 are included using masses and widths determined elsewhere .",
    "it is fortunate that @xmath42 states near 2050 and 2300 mev are strong and accurately determined by their rapid angular dependence , and act as powerful interferometers to determine lower partial waves . starting from these partial waves and adding lower @xmath43 , the analysis finds a unique set of amplitudes ; only in two low partial waves with little or no angular dependence are there sizable errors in fitted masses and widths . recently , as a convenience , we have installed the relevant publications on the arxiv system , and give references in the bibliography .",
    "further details and figures of data are given in a full length review @xcite .",
    "there is a total of @xmath44 million fully reconstructed events .",
    "the data and monte carlo sets are publicly available from the authors of this paper , subject to a joint publication of results .",

    "it is of course possible that @xmath5 is produced with a set of amplitudes which happen to agree with @xmath6 .",
    "further bes iii data with considerably improved acceptance and higher statistics have a high chance of resolving the situation .",
    "the bes ii collaboration also present data on @xmath246 @xcite .",
    "there is a clear peak in @xmath247 at @xmath248 mev .",
    "quantum numbers @xmath249 are favoured quite significantly over @xmath7 and @xmath250 .",
    "the @xmath247 channel opens at 1802 mev .",
    "the present data may be fitted within the sizable errors by folding the line shape of @xmath6 with @xmath247 phase space , using a reasonable form factor @xmath251 , where @xmath252 is the momentum in the @xmath247 channel in gev / c .",
    "the pdg lists this state under @xmath253 , observed in @xmath254 @xcite @xcite .",
    "however , as the pdg remarks , @xmath138 is not allowed for this final state .",
    "the angular distribution of the photon for those data is consistent with @xmath255 , but might be accomodated with @xmath256 if the helicity ratio of the two possible @xmath256 amplitudes is just right . but",
    "neither of these possibilities is consistent with the observed peak presently attributed to @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath257 decays to @xmath258 .",
    "there is an important simplification that in radiative production of @xmath257 there are only three @xmath259 helicity amplitudes instead of five because helicity 0 is forbidden for the photon .",
    "an analysis of the spin correlation between these two would identify @xmath43 of @xmath257 .",
    "the spin of the @xmath224 is measured by @xmath260 , where @xmath261 and @xmath262 are momenta of the kaons from its decay in its rest frame ; the spin of the @xmath263 is normal to the decay plane of the @xmath263 in its rest frame . for spin 0 ,",
    "the angular distribution of @xmath224 and @xmath263 decays is given by the dot product of these two vectors .",
    "this is a delicate test of the spin of the @xmath257 .",
    "formulae for other @xmath43 are given by zou and bugg @xcite .",
    "the decay to @xmath258 is surprising ( okubo - zweig - iizuka violating ) .",
    "it could arise from a glueball component mixed into @xmath257 .",
    "two gluons couple to @xmath264 .",
    "the cross - terms between @xmath265 and @xmath4 can generate @xmath247 .",
    "the @xmath266 would fit naturally on to the @xmath2 trajectory of fig .",
    "1 . it would not be surprising that there are two @xmath148 states close in mass ; a similar pair is @xmath77 and @xmath267 . there is earlier independent evidence for an @xmath268 in mark iii data for @xmath269 @xcite .",
    "there is a further observation of a well defined @xmath2 signal in @xmath21 in crystal barrel data in flight at @xmath270 mev with width @xmath271 mev @xcite .",
    "the mass is 4 standard deviations above @xmath189 and the width is 2 standard deviations higher .",
    "this signal could come from a superposition of @xmath6 with @xmath189 , which clearly has a large @xmath4 component ( and/or glueball ) .",
    "we have made a case that existing light mesons with @xmath259 fall into a regular pattern of @xmath3 @xmath28 and @xmath29 states except for @xmath5 .",
    "there is the possibility that it has been confused with @xmath6 ; if not , there is a missing @xmath148 state on the trajectory of fig . 1 at a similar mass .",
    "the pattern of @xmath189 and @xmath6 is like that of @xmath77 and @xmath53 .",
    "we remark that the search for the @xmath7 glueball will require full use of existing identifications of @xmath11 and @xmath4 components with these quantum numbers .",
    "we have pointed out some corrections to pdg tables .",
    "we also remark that , in the long term , it would be possible to do further polarisation measurements in @xmath14 scattering in the beam momentum range from @xmath272 to 1940 mev / c at the forthcoming fair facility @xcite .",
    "this was part of the proposed program at lear , but was cut short by the closure of that machine .",
    "measurements of polarisation in @xmath130 and @xmath273 are realistic and would give information on interferences between singlet and triplet partial waves .",
    "for @xmath155 , @xmath34 and @xmath0 , @xmath274 , there are presently no polarisation data . such data would improve vastly the identification of states with these quantum numbers .",
