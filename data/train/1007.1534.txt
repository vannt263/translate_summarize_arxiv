    "experiments of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) with @xmath0li atoms is still a challenging research area as the @xmath1-wave scattering length ( @xmath2 ) is negative , which indicates an attractive atom - atom interaction [ 1 ] .",
    "a homogeneous condensate with negative scattering length is impossible , as it leads to ever increasing density [ 2 ] .",
    "as @xmath2 is negative , the attractive interaction energy gradually increases with increase in the number of atoms in a small volume and the condensate approaches collapse .",
    "however , the situation changes drastically in the presence of an external confinement .",
    "a spatially confined bec may be stable for a small , finite number of atoms [ 3 ] . in the presence of a confining potential , the destabilizing effect of the effective negative interaction",
    "is balanced by the kinetic pressure of the gas and a metastable condensate can form [ 1 ] . for @xmath0li , @xmath3 bohr and for t=0 , a metastable condensate exists when the number of atoms is less than the critical number , which is roughly 1300 [ 4 ] , whereas theories predict that bec can occur in a trap with no more than about 1400 atoms [ 3,5 - 7 ] .    during the last decade a number of articles have been published where the properties and stability of the attractive condensate have been discussed in details [ 3,5 - 7 ] .",
    "the two- and three - body decay processes near the collapse have also been studied in a number of papers [ 7,8 ] . however , all the earlier calculations use the mean - field approximation and the ground state energy is calculated by the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) energy functional  @xcite .",
    "gp theory is based on the pseudopotential form of the atom - atom interaction _",
    "i.e. _ a @xmath4-function potential , where the strength of interatomic interaction is absolutely determined by a single parameter @xmath2 .",
    "but due to the presence of the pathological singularity at @xmath5 , the hamiltonian becomes unbound from below and it has been emphasized previously that a @xmath4-function is not suitable as an exact potential in 3d attractive systems  @xcite .",
    "again , as the attractive bec becomes highly correlated near the critical point , uncorrelated gp equation can not take care of the effect of interatomic correlation .",
    "thus the motivation of the present work is to study the same system using an _ ab initio _ many - body method , that is the potential harmonic expansion method @xcite , with the incorporation of a realistic potential , like the van der waals potential .",
    "the presence of a hard sphere below some cutoff radius and the @xmath6 tail properly take care of the effects of both short - range and long - range correlation and accurately represent the realistic features .",
    "we find the commonly known low - density metastable branch and discuss its stability , structure and decay rates due to inelastic two- and three - body collisions . besides the known solution , we also find another branch of solution at a higher density . due to the use of the realistic van der waals interaction in the many - body calculation",
    ", we have a deep attractive well on the left side of the metastable region in the effective potential . in the standard gp theory ,",
    "the metastable region just vanishes at the critical point and the whole condensate collapses into the singular well and the fate of the condensate is not predicted further .",
    "however , in our calculation the metastable condensate leaks through the intermediate barrier and settles down in the extremely narrow ( width @xmath7 ) well .",
    "the atoms become highly correlated and due to high two - body and three - body collisions , atoms form a cluster .",
    "this corresponds to the high - density branch . in the present communication ,",
    "we investigate the transition between the two branches of solutions as a function of the number of atoms and their dependence on the trap size .",
    "we also calculate decay rates of the condensate due to two- and three - body collisions .",
    "in other articles  @xcite , the existence of a similar type of new stable branch has been reported , which is intermediate in density between the dilute metastable state and the collapsed state .",
    "this is described as the effect of use of non - local interaction in the gp theory .",
    "it has been pointed out that for @xmath0li system , the scattering cross - section has a momentum dependence and the effective interaction is non - local , changing from attractive to repulsive at a characteristic range @xmath8 .",
    "they calculated the properties of the attractive condensate by the variational technique . using a gaussian trial wavefunction they minimized the quantum action .    in the present communication",
    ", we also compare our results with those obtained using the non - local interaction .",
    "a road map of the present study is given below .",
    "sec.ii contains the many - body approach used in this work , which is based on the potential harmonic expansion method .",
    "sec.iii presents the calculation with a non - local interaction .",
    "iv contains a comparison of the structure and stability of the bosonic system of both the low- and high - density branches obtained from two different theoretical calculations and the discussion of the many - body effect .",
    "sec.v provides a summary of our results and their conclusions .",
    "we consider a system of a=(n+1 ) identical spinless bosons ( each of mass m ) confined in an external trapping potential @xmath9 and interacting via a two - body potential v(@xmath10 ) , @xmath11 being the position vector of the @xmath12-th particle .",

    "we choose the relative separation of @xmath16 interacting pair ( @xmath17 ) as @xmath18 .",
    "we next define the hyperradius @xmath19 of the set of n jacobi vectors through  @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the position vector of the @xmath12-th particle from the center of mass of the system . in this way",
    "the relative motion of the bosons is described by @xmath22   \\psi(\\vec{\\zeta}_{1 } , ... , \\vec{\\zeta}_{n } ) = 0 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where e@xmath23 is the energy of the relative motion . in the present work",
    "@xmath24 is a spherically symmetric harmonic oscillator potential and consequently @xmath25 the first term on the right side is the effective trap potential @xmath26 for the relative motion and the second term is the trap potential of the center of mass motion .",
    "the equation for the center of mass motion separates completely and is simply the equation for a three dimensional harmonic oscillator .",
    "the total energy of the system is thus @xmath27 . in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , @xmath28 is the sum of all pair - wise interactions , expressed in terms of the jacobi vectors . in our approach",
    "we consider that when @xmath29 pair interacts , the rest of the bosons are inert spectators .",
    "so we define a hyperradius @xmath30 for the remaining ( n-1 ) noninteracting bosons as  @xcite @xmath31 ^{1/2},\\ ] ] so that @xmath32 .",
    "the hyperangle @xmath33 is introduced through @xmath34 and @xmath35 . besides @xmath36 ( where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the polar angles of @xmath39 ) , there are @xmath40 remaining variables .",
    "these are constituted by @xmath41 polar angles associated with ( @xmath42 ) and @xmath43 angles defining their relative lengths and collectively denoted by @xmath44 , called hyperangles in the @xmath45-dimensional space .",
    "the corresponding form of laplace operator can be found in  @xcite . in the potential harmonics expansion method ( phem )",
    ", @xmath46 is decomposed into faddeev components , @xmath47 for the @xmath29 interacting pair as , @xmath48 then eq .  ( 4 ) can be written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "note that the assumptions that correlations higher than two - body ones in @xmath46 are negligible and that the angular and hyperangular momenta of the system are contributed by the interacting pair only  @xcite , make the faddeev component @xmath47 independent of the coordinates of all the particles , other than the interacting pair  @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath51 . with this assumption",
    "we expand @xmath47 in the subset of hyperspherical harmonics ( hh ) necessary for the expansion of v(@xmath39 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath52 this subset of hh is called the potential harmonics ( ph ) basis and is denoted by @xmath53 ; @xmath54 denotes the set of hyperangles in 3n dimensional space with the interacting pair uniquely identified as above .",
    "note also that @xmath55 is independent of ( @xmath42 ) and thus no contribution to the orbital and hyper angular momenta of the condensate comes from the remaining @xmath56 noninteracting bosons .",
    "thus the total orbital angular momenta of the condensate and its projection are simply those of the interacting pair , _ viz .",

    "the quantum number @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( 10 ) is the hyperspherical ( grand orbital ) quantum number in the @xmath66 dimensional space  @xcite , analogous with the orbital angular momentum in three dimensional space .",
    "the ordinary orbital angular momentum of the system and its projection are @xmath57 and @xmath58 , as indicated earlier .",

    "in the experimentally achievable bec , the average interparticle separation is much larger than the range of two - body interaction .",
    "this is indeed required to prevent atomic three - body collisions and formation of molecules . moreover ,",
    "the energy of the interacting pair is extremely small .",
    "thus the two - body interaction is generally represented by the @xmath1-wave scattering length ( @xmath2 ) . in the gp picture ,",
    "the effective interaction is given in terms of @xmath72 alone , making the results independent of the shape of the interatomic potential .",
    "hence , a positive value of @xmath2 gives a repulsive condensate and a negative @xmath2 gives an attractive condensate .",
    "however , a realistic interatomic interaction , like the van der waals potential , is always associated with an attractive @xmath73 tail at larger separations and a strong repulsion at short separations . depending on the nature of these two parts",
    ", @xmath72 can be either positive or negative  @xcite .",
    "for a given two - body potential @xmath74 having a finite range , @xmath72 can be obtained by solving the zero - energy two - body schrdinger equation for the wave function @xmath75 @xmath76 the asymptotic part of @xmath75 has the form @xmath77 and the corresponding @xmath1-wave scattering length is given by @xmath78 .",
    "now the rate of convergence of the ph expansion in eq .",
    "( 9 ) is very slow .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that the leading term of this basis , _ viz . _",
    "the term with @xmath79 , is a non - zero constant , while @xmath47 must be vanishingly small for small values of @xmath80 due to the strong short - range repulsion of @xmath74 .",
    "consequently a large number of terms is needed to represent @xmath47 faithfully for small values of @xmath80 .",
    "the rate of convergence is improved dramatically by introducing a short - range correlation function in the expansion basis  @xcite , that represents the true nature of @xmath81 as @xmath82 . in the experimental bec ,",
    "the energy of the interacting pair ( which is @xmath83 ) is negligible compared with the depth of interaction potential @xmath74 ( which is of the order of typical atomic energy scale ) .",
    "thus @xmath75 is a good representation of the short - range behavior of @xmath81 .",
    "hence we use @xmath75 as a short - range correlation function in the ph expansion , to enhance its rate of convergence  @xcite :    @xmath84    as @xmath75 correctly reproduces the short separation behavior of the interacting - pair faddeev component , convergence rate of the ph expansion for the residual part of @xmath47 is quite fast .",
    "validity of this statement has been tested in numerical calculations . in an actual calculation , we solve eq .",
    "( 14 ) for the zero energy two - body wave function @xmath75 in the chosen two - body potential @xmath74 , after adjusting the hard core radius ( @xmath85 ) , such that @xmath2 has the desired value  @xcite .",
    "this @xmath75 is then used in eq .",
    "( 15 ) .",
    "then the potential matrix becomes @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the jacobi polynomial , whose norm and weight function are @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively  @xcite .",
    "we restrict the k - sum in eq .",
    "( 15 ) to an upper limit @xmath90 from the requirement of convergence .",
    "finally we solve the set of coupled differential equations ( cde ) , eq .",

    "the total energy of the system is obtained by adding energy of the center of mass motion ( @xmath91 ) to @xmath92 .",
    "the wave function of the condensate in the physical space can be obtained from @xmath93 , using eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 9 ) and the ralations between hyperspherical and physical coordinates .",
    "in the standard treatment of alkali - metal atoms , the interatomic interaction is chosen as a local form , i.e. , momentum independent .",
    "the effective zero - range pseudopotential has the form @xmath94 , where @xmath95 .",
    "however , this is not correct when the scattering cross - section has a significant momentum dependence .",
    "this implies that the effective interaction is non - local , changing from attractive to repulsive at a characteristic range @xmath8 .",
    "the system of @xmath0li atoms exhibit such momentum dependence and the effective @xmath96li-@xmath96li interaction can be written as [ 11 ] @xmath97\\ ] ] where @xmath2 corresponds to the attractive potential and has the value @xmath98 bohr , whereas the repulsive contribution is modeled by a local positive term with @xmath99 bohr and @xmath8 = @xmath100 bohr .",

    "depending on the choice of parameters and the number of atoms , this equation either has one root or three roots .",
    "when three solutions are present , one corresponds to the low - density metastable solution ( which we expect for local interaction ) , one corresponds to the high density stable solution ( which is the effect of non - locality ) and the middle one corresponds to an unstable state ( _ i.e. _ local maximum ) .",
    "the variational results for different trap sizes are discussed in the result section .",
    "we consider the experiment on @xmath0li condensate at rice university  @xcite , for which @xmath98 bohr .",

    "choice of a realistic interatomic interaction like the van der waals potential is very important , as it has been shown that the shape - independent approximation is not valid in typical laboratory becs  @xcite . in the local mean - field description",
    "the two - body interaction is usually represented by the @xmath1-wave scattering length @xmath2 .",
    "to mimic the @xmath0li trap of rice university , our chosen parameters are @xmath126  o.u . and @xmath127  o.u . , which reproduce the experimental value of @xmath72 .",
    "with these sets of parameters we solve the set of coupled differential equations by the hyperspherical adiabatic approximation ( haa )  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the hyperradial motion is slow in comparison with the hyperangular motion .",
    "hence , for a fixed value of @xmath19 , the equation for the hyperangular motion can be solved adiabatically .",
    "the energy eigen value of this equation is a parametric function of @xmath19 and provides an effective potential for the hyperradial motion . in the haa prescription ,",
    "the lowest lying such potential is used for the ground state of the system .",

    "solution of the hyperangular motion for a fixed value of @xmath19 is equivalent to diagonalizing the hyperangular hamiltonian in the potential harmonics basis , _",
    "i.e. _ diagonalizing the potential matrix @xmath129 together with the hypercentrifugal term of eq .",
    "the lowest eigenvalue of this matrix , @xmath130 , is the effective potential in the hyperradial space , in which collective motion of the condensate takes place .",

    "1 we plot the effective potential , @xmath130 for n  =  1000 atoms of @xmath0li , the condensate being metastable as n@xmath134n@xmath135 . for n@xmath134n@xmath135 , the intermediate metastable region ( msr ) of @xmath130",
    "is bounded by the high wall of the external trap on the right side and on the left by an intermediate barrier ( ib ) [ panel ( b ) ] . on the left of the ib , a very deep narrow attractive well ( naw ) appears which is again followed by a steeply increasing repulsive wall , as @xmath19 decreases [ panel ( a ) ] .",
    "the existence of a strong repulsive core near the origin ( @xmath136 ) is in sharp contrast to the gp mean - field picture with local interaction and is the immediate reflection of the use of realistic van der waals interaction in quantum many - body calculation . in the gp picture ,",
    "negative @xmath2 presents a singular attraction ( with no repulsive core ) near the origin .",
    "the combination of repulsive core and naw in the present approach , prevents the hamiltonian from being unbound from below .",
    "as the number of atoms increases towards the critical number , the height of the intermediate barrier decreases , the naw becomes more negative and narrow . at n = n@xmath135 ,",
    "the msr along with the intermediate barrier disappear , with the local maximum of the ib and the local minimum of the msr merging to form a point of inflexion  @xcite .",
    "the value of n where this occurs is n@xmath135 .",
    "as n becomes larger than n@xmath135 , all the atoms get trapped in the naw , giving rise to a cluster state resulting from the increased interatomic correlations and two- and three - body collisions .",
    "the release of binding energy is observed as a burst of energy in experiments .",
    "this is the collapse scenario in the present approach .",
    "thus the qualitative features of the pre - collapse scenario are in fair agreement with the gp local mean - field picture away from the critical number .",
    "n = n@xmath135 , the energy per particle becomes @xmath137 in the local gp method , and the hamiltonian becomes unbound from below .",
    "in our many - body calculation the hamiltonian has a lower bound due to the presence of a hypercentrifugal barrier as @xmath136 along with the use of a realistic interatomic interaction with a repulsive core of finite size . in the post - collapse state the atoms accumulate in the narrow attractive well and form clusters .    0.5 cm    we calculate the size of the condensate as a function of the number of @xmath0li atoms , for the choice of the parameters mentioned earlier .",
    "we define the average size of the condensate ( @xmath138 ) as the root mean square distance of individual atoms from the center of mass and is given by  @xcite @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the center of mass coordinate .",

    "the upper branch corresponds to the metastable condensate . with increase in particle number , the total attractive interaction increases as @xmath141 , the system contracts and @xmath138 decreases as expected . for comparison",
    "we present in panel ( a ) the results of the gp equation with contact interaction , i.e. with local interaction .",
    "the lower branch , which corresponds to the high - density stable branch in the deep attractive well , starts from n=20 . in the gp mean - field approach with local interaction",
    ", there is no other stable branch after collapse as the whole condensate falls into the singular well . in our calculation",
    "we find that the size of the condensate in the deep attractive well is of the order of 0.003 @xmath142 , which is the order of the size of the atomic cluster .",
    "this clearly indicates that the metastable condensate forms clusters due to high two - body and three - body collisions within an extremely narrow well of width @xmath143 0.05 @xmath142 .",

    "the effective potential energy @xmath118 [ eq .  ( 21 ) ] has the same qualitative features as the many - body effective potential @xmath130 . unlike the gp effective potential with local interaction , ( having one local minimum ) ,",
    "the use of non - local interaction in the calculation of effective potential offers an additional absolute minimum together with the local minimum .",
    "this absolute minimum corresponds to the high - density stable solution whereas the local minimum corresponds to the usual metastable solution .",

    ", where the high - density stable branch appears from quite small values of n  =  20 , in panel ( b ) , the lower branch starts from n  @xmath144  234 .",
    "this disagreement is due to the fact that the origin of non - locality and the occurrence of absolute minimum is different in the two approaches . in the many - body calculation",
    "the effect of non - locality is inherent due to the presence of hypercentrifugal repulsion ( arising from the many - body treatment ) and the use of van der waals potential with a finite range hard core part whereas in the other approach the non - locality is created by assuming that the attractive potential has a finite range @xmath8 together with a local positive term defined by high - energy scattering length @xmath145 .",

    "the discontinuity disappears at @xmath146 whereas the corresponding trap size in the many - body calculation is @xmath150 .",
    "however , in both cases we observe that the size of the denser cloud is independent of large n , which implies that the atoms are being self - trapped in the non - local minimum .    for the case of a spherical trap with trap size @xmath155",
    ", we fail to find the metastable numerical solutions beyond n @xmath156 atoms .",
    "the instability occurs as the number of atoms increases , the net attractive interaction between atoms becomes dominant and kinetic energy can no longer stabilize the wave function . in the mean - field approach",
    "it has already been pointed out that the transition to an unstable state may occur due to quantum tunnelling .",
    "this tunnelling is similar to the ordinary quantum tunnelling and its rate can be calculated by the semiclassical formula . as this rate is quite small ,",
    "neglecting tunnelling we consider only the loss rates due to two - body dipolar collisions and three - body recombination collisions .",
    "0.5 cm    the total loss rate is given by @xmath157 and the three - body recombination loss rate coefficient @xmath158  @xcite .",
    "@xmath159 is the condensate wave function .",
    "this is simply given by eq .",
    "( 20 ) for the non - local gp approach . for the many - body approach , the wave function @xmath46 is initially obtained as a function of the jacobi coordinates .",
    "it is then transformed into a function of position vectors @xmath160 of @xmath161 particles .",

    "this one - body density is used for @xmath164 in eq .",
    "it is already known that in case of a negative scattering length , the rapid increase in the density of atoms and large increase in the net attractive interaction for a large number of atoms , result in a very large loss rate near the critical point .",
    "thus for the unique metastable branch in gp mean - field picture with local interaction , the loss rate increases very fast with the increase in the number of atoms [ 7 ] . however , due to the presence of the deep attractive well in the many - body picture , we calculate the loss rate for both the branches and observe the discontinuity . by using condensate wave function",
    "as described above , we calculate @xmath165 by using eq .",
    "( 25 ) and the results are plotted in panel ( a ) of fig .  4 .",
    "the lower branch corresponds to the metastable region . as the metastable region is flatter",
    "compared to the naw , although the atoms are correlated , the probability of two or more atoms to come very close is relatively small .",
    "thus the loss rate is initially small and increases with increase in atom number .",
    "the upper branch accounts for the loss rate in the deep narrow attractive well .",
    "as all the atoms are now confined within a very narrow and deep well , they suffer vigorous two- and three - body collisions and the calculated loss rate is much higher than the same calculated in the metastable region .",
    "the transition between these two branches is again discontinuous . in panel ( b ) of fig",
    ".  4 we plot @xmath165 calculated using variational trial wave function of eq .",
    "( 20 ) using non - local interaction .",
    "substitution of trial wave function eq .",
    "( 20 ) in eq .",
    "( 25 ) , leads to @xmath166 in this formula , n is related to @xmath107 through eq .",
    "the existence of low - density metastable branch and high - density stable branch which are separated by an intermediate unstable branch is also reflected in fig .",
    "it is in sharp contrast to the existence of a unique metastable branch in the mean - field approach with local potential . for the sake of completeness , in fig .",
    "5 we plot the loss rate for traps of different sizes .    0.5 cm",
    "in summary , we have analyzed the stability of the attractive bose - einstein condensate of @xmath96li atoms in a harmonic trap using an _ ab initio _",
    "quantum many - body calculation incorporating realistic van der waals interaction and all possible two - body correlations . unlike the single metastable condensate arising from the gp mean - field theory with local interaction",
    ", we observe that the atomic cloud may exist in different states .",
    "in addition to the commonly known low density metastable bec state , we find a high density stable solution , which corresponds to the cluster state of the lithium atoms . between these two minima ,",
    "there is a maximum of the effective potential , which does not correspond to any stable physical state of the bose gas .",
    "the local gp approach produces only the metastable solution , together with an intermediate barrier ( local maximum ) , but the effective potential has no lower bound on the left of the intermediate barrier .",
    "indeed there is a pathological singularity at the origin , which only produces a pathological collapse ( not leading to any physical solution ) .",
    "the effect of a non - local momentum dependent interaction ( replacing the local contact interaction ) in the gp approach was investigated in earlier works  @xcite using a variational _",
    "ansatz_. the results of this non local",
    "gp approach agree qualitatively with our present observations .",
    "the lack of quantitative agreement is attributed to the difference in the origins of non - locality in the two approaches .",
    "we have investigated the average size of the bosonic system , as also the loss rates due to two- and three - body collisions for both the metastable bec state and the collapsed cluster state . in general",
    "these quantities lie on separate branches for the two states . for larger trap lengths ,",
    "the two branches are unconnected .",
    "but there is a continuous transition for very tight traps .",
    "the local gp approach produces only one branch , corresponding to the metastable state .",
    "the local gp uses an attractive contact interaction for the @xmath96li condensate .",
    "this causes a pathological singularity at the origin , preventing any stable collapsed state .",
    "the non local gp approach uses a non - local potential , which is attractive at larger separations , but has a repulsive contact interaction as @xmath167 .",
    "hence there is no pathological singularity and the effective potential becomes strongly repulsive as @xmath167 .",
    "this gives rise to the stable high density branch . in the phem approach , the realistic van der waals ( vdw )",
    "potential is used .",
    "this has a very strong repulsion at short separations and an attractive @xmath168 long tail .",
    "the strongly repulsive core of the vdw potential , together with the hypercentrigugal repulsion , arising from the phem approach , produces a repulsive core followed by a deep attractive well as one moves away from the origin in the effective potential , @xmath169 .",
    "thus both the phem and the non local gp approaches produce the same qualitative results .",
    "however , quantitative differences exist due to different origins of non - locality in these two approaches . while , non - locality in the many - body approach arises from the use of vdw potential with a repulsive core and the hypercentrifugal repulsion , that in the non local gp approach is built in the choice of the two - body potential .",
    "although the presence of an intermediate state has already been established in earlier works where gp mean - field theory has been employed with non - local interaction  @xcite , the effect of the short - range behavior of realistic interatomic potential on the intermediate state has not been investigated as yet . especially in the collapse regime , where the atomic cloud becomes highly correlated , the use of a correlated many - body approach is required for the accurate determination of the collapse point and various properties of the atomic cluster .",
    "the non - local interaction in the effective interaction can prevent a pathological collapse , which results in the gp approach with a purely local attractive interaction .",
    "the comparison of these two approaches is elaborately discussed in the present work . in the usual trap setup",
    "we observe a discontinuous jump between the low - density and high - density phases .",
    "however , the use of tight traps is also interesting and we observe how the discontinuous jump can be avoided by using microtraps . for large number of atoms , the system remains in a quantum self - trapped state ."
