    "subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars are horizontal - branch stars with masses @xmath20.47m@xmath3 , thin ( @xmath4m@xmath3 ) hydrogen surface layers , and effective temperatures from @xmath5 to @xmath6k @xcite .",
    "they represent the aftermath of the core helium flash , and as such are important stars for understanding this rapid phase of stellar evolution . some of these stars are nonradial pulsators , and we can exploit this by using the tools of asteroseismology to probe their interior structure , as well as determine accurate estimates of their total mass , shell mass , luminosity , internal rotation , and the extent of radiative levitation and gravitational diffusion .",
    "pulsating sdb stars come in two varieties .",
    "the first type to be found was the short - period v361hya stars @xcite .",
    "they are typically referred to as sdbv stars .",
    "their pulsations are @xmath7-modes , with periods that range from two to four minutes , but they can range up to ten minutes ; pulsation amplitudes are typically near 1 per cent of their mean brightness @xcite .",
    "the second variety are longer - period @xmath1mode pulsators , first discovered in 2003 @xcite and known as v1093her ( or pg1716 ) stars .",
    "they are commonly referred to as long - period sdbv ( lpsdbv ) stars .",
    "their periods range from 45min to more than 2hr with amplitudes typically @xmath80.1 per cent though amplitudes up to 0.5 per cent have been observed @xcite .",
    "they also are all multimode pulsators .",
    "examples of the large number of pulsation modes determined using ground - based observations are pg1338 + 481 , with 13 periodicities @xcite , and pg1627 + 017 with 23 periodicities",
    "there is also a group of hybrid stars that pulsate with both short and long periods @xcite .",
    "those stars that are @xmath7-mode pulsators allow us to probe the outer layers of these stars to below the transition from hydrogen to helium .",
    "for understanding their cores - and directly probing the regions where helium is undergoing fusion - we need accurate measurements of @xmath0-modes @xcite .",
    "the observational challenges in accurately identifying the pulsation modes are significant .",
    "this usually requires extensive photometric campaigns , preferably at several sites spaced in longitude to reduce day / night aliasing .",
    "however , _ kepler _ provides long - duration continuous , homogenous , evenly spaced time - series photometry , making it an ideal instrument for asteroseismology .    the striking advantage of _ kepler _ data is the many improvements over ground - based data , particularly for long - period sdbv variability . from the ground",
    ", one can only observe a few pulsation cycles during nighttime hours .",
    "if multisite observations are obtained , then differing instrument sensitivities become an issue , and because of weather , gaps will doubtlessly appear in the data .",
    "additionally , ground - based observations have to contend with atmospheric transparency variations that can often act on the same time scales as the pulsations in the stars .",
    "in contrast , _ kepler _ data are optimal for these types of pulsators in that nearly gap - free data are obtained at a roughly constant cadence and with no atmospheric issues .",
    "the combined advantage in signal  to  noise and coverage allows us to detect many more pulsation frequencies than earth - bound telescopes can obtain , even with significant effort .    because of their asteroseismic potential , sdb stars ( and white dwarfs ) are targets that form a key component in the _ kepler mission _ s asteroseismic investigation .",
    "the _ kepler mission _ science goals , mission design , and overall performance are reviewed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "asteroseismological analysis for the _ kepler mission _ is being conducted through the _ kepler _ asteroseismic science consortium ( kasc )  see @xcite .",
    "compact pulsators , including sdb stars and white dwarfs , are the responsibility of the compact pulsators working group ( wg11 ) , which is overseeing the analysis of the survey phase data on pulsating hot subdwarfs .",
    "wg11 target selection , spectroscopic properties of the targets , and overall results of the search for pulsators are described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i ) .",
    "the first short period sdbv star found by _",
    "kepler _ is presented in ( * ? ? ?",

    "long - period sdb pulsators found in the first part of the survey phase are described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper iii ) with detailed modelling of one of those stars in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper iv ) .",
    "one of the lingering mysteries in stellar astrophysics is the mechanism by which sdb stars form .",
    "there are many of these stars , all of which have very thin surface hydrogen layers .",
    "their relatively high effective temperatures signify surface hydrogen layers ranging from @xmath9 to @xmath10m@xmath11 .",
    "one of the leading formation scenarios relies on binary mass transfer as the sdb progenitor climbs the first giant branch @xcite and , in fact , many sdb stars ( pulsators and non - pulsators ) show evidence of close companions @xcite . in several cases ,",
    "pulsating sdb stars are in close binaries with orbital periods of a few hours to 1.2 days or so @xcite .",
    "because the orbital period is so short , the stars should be in synchronous rotation @xcite .",
    "thus these systems can help test ideas of tidal synchronization through spectroscopy @xcite and photometry @xcite .",
    "asteroseismic studies suggest that the sdb component of the binaries feige 48 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath12@xmath29h ) and pg1336 - 018 ( * ? ? ? * @xmath12=2.4h ) are indeed in synchronous rotation . in feige48 ,",
    "the companion is probably a white dwarf @xcite , while in pg1336 - 018 the companion is an m5 star @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine two long - period sdb pulsators discovered during the survey phase of the _ kepler mission _ : kic02991403 and kic11179657 . both of these stars show evidence for low - amplitude variation revealing a close binary companion with an orbital period of 9 - 10hr .",
    "the photometric variations suggest a lower - mass companion displaying the reflection effect .",
    "the parameters of the binary systems ( beyond the orbital period and amplitude of photometric variation ) are at the moment not known , so in this paper we concentrate on analysis of the pulsations and defer a detailed discussion of the binary properties to a later paper .",
    "we note that another complex pulsating sdb star in a close binary was uncovered in the survey phase , with preliminary analysis presented in @xcite .",
    "this paper describes data obtained by _ kepler _ during 2009 .",
    "the data released to the kasc compact stars working group ( wg11 ) are short cadence ( sc ) data with an average cadence of 58.85s .",
    "this pipeline provides time series of `` raw '' flux values for each target , and `` corrected '' fluxes based on preliminary estimates for contamination by nearby stars . because the contamination correction will be improved with further upgrades to the data pipeline , in this paper we work with the raw fluxes provided to the kasc . for analysis of the flux variations , we consider fractional variations away from the mean flux ( i.e. , differential intensity @xmath13 ) .",
    "amplitudes are given as milli - modulation amplitudes ( mma ) , with 10mma corresponding to 1.0 per cent .    while the data from _ kepler _ are nearly continuous , there are occasional gaps in the data as the result of safing events and other brief anomalies .",
    "the window function of the power spectrum is essentially a sinc@xmath14 function with a width equal to the inverse of the run length , since the duty cycle of the reduced light curves is so high , and the outlying points are scattered more - or - less randomly through the light curves .",
    "the time series data provided from the sc data frequently show instrumental artefacts that are at multiples of the long - cadence ( lc ) readout rate of 1/30 the sc rate .",
    "this produces peaks in the temporal spectrum at @xmath15hz , and experience shows that the largest - amplitude artefact peaks are in the 4000 to 7000 @xmath16hz region @xcite .",
    "all variation frequencies in these data are well short of @xmath17hz and so we are not influenced by this artefact .",
    "the two targets were selected using the process described in paper i ; further details about these two targets can be found in that paper .",
    "these two stars are the faintest of the eight pulsating sdb stars uncovered in the first half of the survey phase .",

    "the raw data contain a significant number of outlier points - we removed these points by first boxcar filtering the data to remove the orbital effects , and then identifying , for later removal , points that were in excess of 4 times the rms deviation of points from the mean .",

    "this provides a @xmath23 frequency resolution of 0.43@xmath16hz .",
    "a total of 39,810 science images were scheduled .",
    "however because of safing events , loss of fine guidance , and other small glitches 1,492 images were either not obtained or were contaminated in some way .",
    "as for kic02991403 , we de - trended the slow variation in the mean level of the data , and removed 4-@xmath29 outliers , resulting in a total of 38,272 data points in the reduced light curve .",
    "the kic lists a contamination factor of 0.129 , thus the amplitudes we determine in the time - series analysis using the raw fluxes are closer to the true amplitude in the star than for kic02991403 .",
    "our analysis proceeded in a straightforward way as has been used in prior papers in this series @xcite .",
    "we calculated a temporal spectrum ( a fourier transform ; ft ) which provides initial estimates of pulsation frequencies and amplitudes .",
    "we simultaneously fit and prewhitened the data for each of these frequencies using non - linear least - squares ( nlls ) , beginning with the highest amplitude frequency until we reached the 4-@xmath29 detection limit .",
    "we determined @xmath29 by finding the mean value of the temporal spectrum in the frequency range of interest , excluding obvious periodicities .",
    "we begin here with a discussion of the binary light curves , and the assumed impact that rotation should have on the pulsations as we search for evidence of rotational splitting at the orbital / co - rotation frequency .",
    "we follow with analysis of the higher - frequency pulsational periodicities in the two stars .",
    "both of these stars show variations with periods of about 10h .",
    "kic02991403 and , to a lesser extent , kic11179657 , show equal amplitude , peaked maxima and shallow minima , typical of the irradiation effect produced when an sdb star heats up the face of an m - dwarf orbiting the subdwarf ( with its rotation period likely synchronized to the orbital period ) .",
    "these effects produce light curves with a dominant peak at the orbital frequency , and a smaller peak at the first harmonic .",
    "the bottom panels of figure [ fig01 ] show the binned light curves for the two stars .",
    "the specifics of the binary properties , including spectroscopic observations , will appear in a subsequent publication .",
    "no eclipses are evident in either light curve , and the amplitude is quite low compared to other known sdb+dm binaries . for comparison , the amplitude of the reflection effect in the sdb+dm binary he  0230 - 4323 @xcite is about 4 per cent in v , and the orbital period is 10.8h .",
    "the eclipsing sdb+dm binary pg  1336 - 018 ( orbital period of 2.4hr ) is almost 10 per cent @xcite .",
    "since pg  1336 - 018 is an eclipsing system , the inclination must be close to 90@xmath30 and so represents the intrinsic reflection effect amplitude . on the other hand ,",
    "if the amplitude of the effect drops with the square of the orbital separation , then the intrinsic amplitude of the reflection effect is approximately 6.3 times smaller , or 16mma .",
    "if that is the case , then these systems may be closer to edge - on , since the amplitude of the reflection effect that we see is then comparable to what we would expect . in the opposite extreme ,",
    "if the intrinsic amplitude is similar for these somewhat longer - period binaries , then the low amplitudes we see ( down by a factor of 10 ) could indicate a much smaller inclination of @xmath31 or so . from the information we currently have about these stars , it is difficult to say what , if any , constraints the binary light curve places on the orbital inclination .",
    "time - series spectroscopy will be required to constrain the companion type and inclination angle further .",
    "in the left panels of figure [ fig02 ] and figure [ fig03 ] we show the temporal spectrum of the frequency region containing the binary period and first harmonic .",
    "the right panels in these figures show the area of the temporal spectrum where pulsations appear .    for this analysis ,",
    "we are primarily interested in how the binarity impacts the variations attributed to pulsations . for close binaries such as these",
    ", one expects that the stars will be in synchronous rotation - that is , the rotation frequencies of the stars should match the orbital frequency of the binary ( @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the rotation frequency and @xmath34 is the orbital frequency ) , and that the rotation and orbital axes are aligned . for nonradial pulsation",
    ", rotation should cause a shift in the observed oscillation frequencies for modes with nonzero values of the azimuthal quantum number @xmath35 .",
    "in particular , for slow rotation ( @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the pulsation frequency ) it is well known that : @xmath38 @xcite . here , the indices @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath35 correspond to the radial order @xmath39 and the indices of the spherical harmonic functions @xmath41 .",
    "the quantity @xmath42 describes the contribution to the splitting caused by the coriolis force , and is a function of the eigenfunction for the appropriate nonradial mode .",
    "rotation , therefore , can break the degenerate @xmath35 frequencies into their @xmath43 components separated approximately by the rotation frequency .",
    "as such , multiplets can be used to associate pulsation modes ( described by @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath35 ) with observed frequencies .",
    "seismic models of stars provide the theoretical oscillation frequency spectrum , which can be quite rich ; two similar models can show similar frequencies , but with different values for @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath35 .",
    "therefore mode identifications are needed to constrain stellar models , which in turn are used to infer internal conditions of the stars themselves .    for the long - period pulsations seen in these stars",
    ", we expect that they are high - order @xmath0-modes . a useful approximation for these modes , where the horizontal motions are significantly larger than the radial motions ,",
    "is that @xmath44 consulting evolutionary models in the relevant mass , @xmath45 and @xmath46 ranges from @xcite and @xcite , we find that @xmath42 ranges from 0.465 to 0.496 for @xmath47 @xmath0-modes in the observed period range ( see below ) and between 0.158 to 0.165 for @xmath48 modes .",
    "so the above approximation appears reasonable for these stars .",
    "we note that if there is some tidal deformation of the sdb stars in these binaries , that there may be additional frequency shifts associated with that change in stellar shape ( i.e. one would expect equally spaced multiplets for all modes with the same spacing if the tidal axis coincides with the pulsation axis ) . for this initial analysis , we assume that the pulsators are spherically symmetric .    while rotation can lift the @xmath35 degeneracy and produce @xmath49 peaks for each value of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the viewing geometry ( as well as the intrinsic pulsation amplitude ) will alter the observed amplitudes .",
    "the geometric effects , at least , can be computed in a straightforward way ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "for these stars , which show orbital effects in the light curve , we expect that the stars are in synchronous rotation at the orbital period .",
    "thus , @xmath47 modes are likely to appear as multiplets split by 0.51 to 0.54 @xmath34 with up to 3 peaks for each overtone @xmath39 . for @xmath48 we should look for a multiplet splitting of about @xmath50 , with up to 5 peaks for each overtone .",
    "the temporal spectrum of kic02991403 , prior to prewhitening , is shown in figure [ fig02 ] , in the top panels .",
    "there are several artefact frequencies in the 4500 - 5500 @xmath16hz range , but most of the peaks in the ft of this star occur in the 100 - 400 @xmath16hz range .",
    "we determine a 4-@xmath29 detection limit using apparently variation - free frequency regions above and below this range . between 1 and 150@xmath16hz ,",
    "the 4-@xmath29 limit is 0.40mma , and between 400 and 550@xmath16hz we find a value for the 4-@xmath29 limit of 0.31mma .",
    "this detection limit is shown as a blue ( mostly horizontal ) line in figure [ fig02 ] .",
    "the middle and bottom panels of figure  [ fig02 ] show the detection limit and the prewhitening process for kic2991403 .",
    "the highest amplitude variation has a frequency near @xmath51hz and a period near 0.44d .",
    "this frequency and its associated overtone are attributed to binarity and shown in the left panels of figure  [ fig02 ] .",
    "we detected 16 other frequencies that we attribute to long - period @xmath1mode pulsations .",
    "these are listed in table  [ tab01 ] along with their amplitudes and periods and indicated in figure  [ fig02 ] with arrows .",
    "no peaks remain in the ft above the detection limit after removal of these periodicities .",
    "table  [ tab01 ] lists the resulting periodicities . of the 16 pulsation frequencies in the table ,",
    "there are 5 sets of closely spaced multiplets .",
    "we list these close spacings , along with the spacings expected for synchronous ( and uniform ) rotation in table [ tab02 ] .",
    "the smallest of these spacings , 0.47@xmath16hz , is a bit larger than the formal frequency resolution of 0.35@xmath16hz .",
    "the other close spacings have values of approximately 0.55 to 0.58@xmath16hz or multiples thereof .",
    "if these small spacings are interpreted as a rotational splitting of @xmath47 modes , then the implied rotation period ( using equation 1 and 2 ) is 10.4d .",
    "if they are @xmath48 sectoral @xmath52 modes , then the rotation period is 34d . in either case",
    ", if this splitting is indeed caused by rotation , then this star is far from synchronous rotation . to obtain a more precise estimate of these spacings ( or to see if more periodicities are present than suspected )",
    "will require a much longer run on this star .",

    "the binary nature of these two stars , and in particular the short orbital periods , promises to provide the extra information necessary for identifying rotationally split multiplets under the assumption that the primary star  the sdb  is forced into synchronous rotation .",
    "if that is the case , the discussion in section 2 leads to the expectation that rotationally split multiplets should be seen with splittings of 13.6(21.9)@xmath16hz for @xmath47(@xmath48 ) modes in kic02991403 . for kic11179657 ,",
    "the respective expectations are 15.3@xmath16hz for @xmath47 modes , and 24.6@xmath16hz for @xmath48 modes .",
    "both stars show fine structure ( that is , frequency separations that are small compared to the orbital frequency ) that resembles rotational splitting for slow rotation .",
    "identification of almost - equally spaced triplets in these stars suggests that these splittings are  permanent \" rather than a manifestation of slow amplitude or phase modulation .",
    "however , both stars also show larger splittings at the expected values for a synchronous rotation - for @xmath47 in the case of kic02991403 , and for @xmath48 in kic1179657 . in both cases ,",
    "the spacings imply that we are seeing sectoral @xmath70 and , curiously , the higher frequency component shows fine structure ( as defined above ) .",
    "this splitting hierarchy has been seen in other @xmath0-mode pulsators - in particular , the pulsating hot white dwarf ( gw  vir ) star pg  2131 + 066 @xcite .",
    "the relatively small number of periodicities identified ( so far ) in kic02991403 and kic11179657 makes it difficult to identify multiplets with splittings compatible with the binary frequency , especially considering that the splitting depends on the value of @xmath71 .",
    "we do hope that further observations will reveal more periodicities , and expect that theoretical models of this star can allow us to make more precise estimates of @xmath71 .",
    "when analysing @xmath0-modes , we often take advantage of asymptotic behavior of the periods to try to estimate the values of @xmath40 and @xmath39 . in particular , for @xmath0-modes , in the absence of strong mode trapping , the periods of modes with the same @xmath40 and consecutive @xmath39 are equally spaced in period , with a fundamental period spacing @xmath72 that is determined by the global structure of the star . in particular , we have : @xmath73 thus , a sequence of @xmath0-modes with consecutive values of @xmath39 and the same value of @xmath40 will be spaced equally in period .",
    "small departures from equal spacing result from abrupt changes ( with depth ) in stars ( e.g. density discontinuities that accompany composition gradients ) , and so the spacings can be a powerful probe of the interior structure of stars .",
    "we see this behavior very clearly in pulsating white dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the period spacings depend on @xmath40 in a predictable way : modes with the same value of @xmath39 but with @xmath47 and @xmath48 will have periods in a ratio of approximately @xmath74 . in those ( rare ) cases",
    "where sequences of @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xmath0-modes are confirmed ( i.e. through rotationally split multiplets ) , we also see that the spacing ratio is indeed close to 1.7 ( e.g. pg  1159 - 035 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    up until now these properties of @xmath0-modes",
    "have not been applied to the long - period sdb stars because of the paucity of observed modes and/or secure @xmath40 determinations , and uncertainties in the rotational splitting ( and identification of @xmath75 periods ) , using ground - based data . in paper iii we reported on the pulsations of other long  period sdb pulsators that are",
    "_ kepler _ survey targets . in at least one case , kic10670103 , we do see sequences of equally spaced periods , and in fact can identify an @xmath47 sequence with a period spacing of 251s , and an @xmath48 sequence with a spacing of 146s .",
    "the ratio is 1.72 , and confirms the expectations from the asymptotic behavior of @xmath0-modes .",
    "for the two stars in this paper , are there periods that are equally spaced ? tables [ tab05 ] and [ tab06 ] address this question by listing the periods in each star , along with the period differences between consecutive ( identified ) periodicities .",
    "though the number of periodicities is smaller than for kic10670103 , the periods seem to show similar spacings to that star .",
    "the mean spacing of about 136  s in f4 through f16 in kic02991403 is similar to the @xmath48 spacings in kic10670103 .",
    "this spacing is inconsistent with the preliminary results based on rotational splitting , which favors an @xmath47 assignment for f11 and f14 ( and f15 ) .",
    "in kic11179657 , with fewer periodicities , the period structure also shows spacings that are compatible with those seen in kic02991403 and kic10670103 . in summary ,",
    "period spacings are insufficiently well defined to assign secure values of @xmath40 for these stars",
    ". this may be because rotational splitting is present and we are not seeing @xmath75 modes .",
    "even though we can not say , with confidence , that we see an equal period spacing in either of these stars , we can still use the asymptotics of @xmath0-modes to say something about the value of @xmath40 .",
    "if the driving mechanism acts on a limited number of overtones ( @xmath39 ) , we would expect to see groups of periods in the temporal spectrum with the centroids of those groups with a period ratio of 1.73 . in kic1117657 , the strongest mode ( f7 )",
    "has a period of 2966s .",
    "if that is an @xmath48 mode , the corresponding @xmath47 mode should have a period of roughly 5140s .",
    "this is fairly close to f2 in that star , which is the second strongest pulsation : the ratio of f2 to f7 is 1.723 .",
    "this suggests that we are seeing @xmath48 and @xmath47 pulsations in this star .",
    "we note that _ kepler _ data on a single long - period sdbv star , kic10670103 ( paper iii ) , shows the same pattern of apparent @xmath47 and @xmath48 period ratios .",
    ".period spacings in kic02991403.[tab05 ] [ cols=\"<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     similarly , among the main periodicities in kic02991403 , the highest - amplitude mode has a period of 2987s .",
    "assigning that mode to @xmath48 suggests that the @xmath47 counterpart should be at a period of 5173s , which is very close to the doublet ( f2,f3 ) at 5130s .",
    "the ratio of f14 to f2 is 1.720 .",
    "this too is remarkably close to the asymptotic value of 1.732 .",
    "this simplistic preliminary analysis suggests that we are indeed seeing @xmath48 and @xmath47 modes .",
    "this , in turn , means that the largest amplitude modes have @xmath48 in some cases - which is surprising since the higher - degree modes suffer more geometric cancelation across the surface .",
    "thus there are several lines of evidence , all circumstantial at this point , that we are seeing @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xmath0-modes in these two stars .",
    "we expect to have longer runs ( 3 months or more ) on these stars as the _ kepler mission _ continues , and expect that the increase in frequency precision and signal - to - noise should help us determine , with certainty , the rotational state of these stars .",
    "further exploration of the binary properties ( i.e. a radial velocity study verifying the orbital and rotational signatures ) should provide clues as to the properties of the ( presumably dm ) companions , and the nature of the binary light curves . with this information in hand , these stars should play an important role in improving our understanding of the binary nature of sdb stars in general , and the role that binarity plays in their formation and subsequent evolution .",
