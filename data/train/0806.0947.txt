    "one - dimensional discrete solitons in periodic media have been proposed both in the framework of nonlinear optics  @xcite and that of bose - einstein condensates ( becs )  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "their two - dimensional counterparts have attracted intense investigational effort in recent years . in this context , it has been shown that two - dimensional optical discrete solitons can exist in optically induced lattices  @xcite , in nonlinear photonic crystals  @xcite , and in nonlinear photonic crystal fibers  @xcite .",
    "in addition , experimental observations of these solitons in one and two dimensions have been reported in optically induced lattices  @xcite and in modulated bessel optical lattices  @xcite . in parallel to these findings , discrete soliton vortices have been proposed both in the context of discrete models  @xcite and in continuous models of optically induced lattices  @xcite , bessel lattices  @xcite , and photonic crystal fibers  @xcite .",
    "they have been also experimentally observed in optically induced lattices  @xcite .",
    "other discrete solitons , such as dipole and quadropole solitons , have been shown to exist by means of numerical simulations in optically induced lattices  @xcite , in bessel lattices  @xcite , and in photonic crystal fibers  @xcite , and they have been observed in the former system  @xcite .",
    "bright discrete solitons , vortex solitons and dipole solitons have been also proposed in a self - attractive ( or focusing ) bec loaded in an optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "different results have been obtained in the self - repulsive ( or defocusing ) case .",
    "extended solitons or bec arrays have been realized in 2d optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "these bec arrays displayed coherent spatial structures in 2d induced by modulational instability  @xcite .",
    "this was the mechanism that permitted researchers to propose in - phase and @xmath0 out - of - phase discrete bright solitons in self - defocusing media  @xcite .",
    "all these localized structures have been found as soliton solutions of 2d nonlinear schrdinger equations ( nlse ) with a periodic potential and different expressions for the nonlinear part ( kerr focusing or defocusing nonlinearity , saturable , etc )  we will refer to all such equations as _ generalized nonlinear schrdinger equations_. in addition , the amplitude of all these solitons has discrete rotational symmetry . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was proven that a soliton of a generalized nlse in a discrete rotationally symmetric potential with a nonlinearity depending on the modulus of the field must belong to some representation of the corresponding discrete rotational group , provided that its modulus is also discrete rotational invariant . as proved in ref .",
    "@xcite , this property implies that there must exist a `` cut - off '' in the allowed values of the vorticity of a discrete vortex soliton in discrete rotational symmetry media , as long as the discrete vortex presents a single singularity .",
    "it was also demonstrated that identical results can be obtained if the discrete vortex soliton is reinterpreted as an angular bloch mode characterized by its angular pseudomomentum , which is conserved along the direction of propagation  @xcite .",
    "another important result is the existence of a rule that links angular momentum and angular pseudomomentum in an interface between a rotationally invariant and a discrete rotationally invariant medium  @xcite .",
    "this rule permits the study of vorticity transformations in this kind of interfaces  @xcite and some of these transformations have been experimentally observed  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will rigorously prove that the solitons of a generalized nlse with a nonlinearity depending on the modulus of the field can be classified according to the irreducible representations of a discrete group , if that modulus is discrete rotationally invariant .",
    "we will show that , consequently , a different quantity can be assigned to discrete solitons , discrete vortex solitons , and discrete @xmath1-pole solitons ( for example , dipole or quadrupole solitons ) .",
    "we will name this quantity _ angular pseudomomentum _ to be consistent with the nomenclature of ref .",
    ". we will also offer detailed proofs of the conservation of angular pseudomomentum and transformation rules between angular momentum and pseudomomentum .",
    "finally , we will outline the extension of these results to the quantum limit .",

    "[ class ] , the classification of discrete solitons according to angular pseudomomentum is demonstrated . in sec .",
    "[ solu ] examples of this classification are provided . section  [ dynam ] is devoted to the conservation of angular pseudomomentum and to the transformation rules between angular momentum and pseudomomentum . in sec .",

    "[ conc ] the conclusions are presented .",
    "let @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 is a function invariant under a symmetry group @xmath6 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath6 is the rotational symmetry group @xmath7 ( not to be confused with an order of magnitude symbol ) , a discrete rotational symmetry group @xmath8 of order @xmath9 , or a discrete rotation - reflection symmetry group @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a function such that @xmath13 is invariant under a symmetry group @xmath14 and @xmath15 is a function invariant under the same group as @xmath13 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath14 , the symmetry group of @xmath16 , is a subset or coincides with @xmath6 , the symmetry group of @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath17 . under these assumptions",
    ", let us consider the eigenvalue equation @xmath18 a solution @xmath19 of this equation gives rise to a stationary solution @xmath20 of the generalized nlse @xmath21 let @xmath22 be a solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ec_estacionarias ] ) .",
    "we call the _ differential operator generated by @xmath23 _ the function @xmath24 .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath19 of this operator with eigenvalue @xmath25 satisfy @xmath26 .",
    "the function @xmath22 is a _ self - consistent solution _ since @xmath27 .",
    "the function @xmath23 is a _",

    "if @xmath28 . a function @xmath29 is a _ non - self - consistent solution _ if @xmath30 but @xmath31 .",
    "note that the differential operator @xmath32 is hermitian since @xmath33 , and therefore all its eigenvalues @xmath25 are real , @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , @xmath35 since @xmath5 and @xmath36 are real functions .    for a self - consistent solution @xmath23 , if we conjugate the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq : ec_estacionarias ] ) we find that @xmath37 , since @xmath38 is a real function and @xmath39 , @xmath15 is a real function , and therefore , @xmath40 .",
    "hence , @xmath41 is also a self - consistent solution with eigenvalue @xmath42 of the same operator .",

    "this proves the following lemma :    [ pro : complejo_conjugado_tb_sol ] if @xmath23 is a self - consistent solution with eigenvalue @xmath25 , @xmath41 is also a self - consistent solution with the same eigenvalue .",
    "let us prove now the following important lemma :    [ pro : psi_sol_autocons_y_tb_de_otro_operador _ ] if @xmath23 is a self - consistent solution with eigenvalue @xmath25 , and @xmath45 is a function such that @xmath46 , then @xmath45 is a self - consistent solution if and only if ( i ) @xmath47 or , ( ii ) @xmath48 , with @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",

    "this fact implies ( i ) @xmath47 or , ( ii ) @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath57 .    on the other hand ,",
    "if ( i ) @xmath47 or , ( ii ) @xmath48 , obviously @xmath51 is a self - consistent solution since , in both cases , @xmath58 .",
    "this proves the previous lemma .",
    "now we proceed to apply this lemma to the transformed functions @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is an element of the group @xmath14 . before doing this",
    "we observe that    @xmath61 or @xmath62    it is clear that @xmath24 is invariant under the symmetry group @xmath14 of @xmath16 .",
    "firstly , @xmath63 is invariant under the symmetry group @xmath7 , and consequently it is invariant under any discrete rotational symmetry group .",
    "secondly , the function @xmath5 is invariant under the symmetry group @xmath6 . since we have assumed that @xmath28 it must be also invariant under the symmetry group @xmath14 . and finally , @xmath64 is invariant under the symmetry group @xmath14 since @xmath16 is also invariant under this group .",
    "so @xmath65 and therefore    @xmath66    hence @xmath67 is also an eigenfunction with the same eigenvalue .",
    "then , the conditions of lemma [ pro : psi_sol_autocons_y_tb_de_otro_operador _ ] are satisfied for @xmath68 .",

    "this is equivalent to the statement that the eigenfunctions of @xmath44 characterized by the eigenvalue @xmath25 belong to the irreducible representations of the group @xmath14@xcite .",
    "the representations of @xmath72 or @xmath10 are one or two - dimensional are one - dimensional . since @xmath73 , there are pairs of irreducible representations whose characters are mutually conjugate and that share the same eigenvalue  @xcite . in quantum mechanics",

    "the rotational elements of these groups are given by two - dimensional unitary matrices . in the diagonal basis",

    "on the other hand , we have shown that the self - consistent solution @xmath23 verifies that @xmath76 where @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , @xmath23 is an eigenfunction of @xmath78 with eigenvalue @xmath1 .",
    "comparison with the previous expression implies that @xmath79 .",
    "moreover , group theory insures that the other eigenfunction of the @xmath78 operator has to be @xmath80  @xcite .",
    "we can summarize these arguments in the following theorem :    [ thm : clasificacion_soluciones_simetricas ] let @xmath81 be a symmetric self - consistent solution and let us assume that @xmath28 .",

    "@xcite .",
    "discrete rotation - reflection groups @xmath10 present one- and two - dimensional representations . under the @xmath87 rotational element of the group @xmath88 the function transforms as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a unitary constant .",
    "but under the reflection elements of the group @xmath91 , the function is transformed as @xmath92 or as @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is a unitary constant .",
    "so these transformations could involve the function and its complex conjugate .",

    "two of these representations are one - dimensional , while the rest are two - dimensional .",
    "adding reflections to @xmath8 to form a @xmath10 group means , on the one hand , that these mutually conjugated representations form a single two - dimensional representation . on the other hand , the two one - dimensional representations split due to different behaviours of the functions with respect to the reflection axes of the group  @xcite . in both kinds of groups ,",
    "all the transformation rules can be satisfied by functions of the form @xmath97 , where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are polar coordinates .",

    "such a question , that at first glance could seem to be a purely academic one , has become extremely important since bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) became experimentally feasible thirteen years ago  @xcite . in order to provide an answer to this question",

    "can be clearly observed how the aforementioned angular pseudo - momentum relations also hold in the case of few - boson systems once the angular pseudo - momentum is properly identified with a quantum number by means of the generator of the symmetry group .",
