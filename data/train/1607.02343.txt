    "in numerous applications in quantum physics and chemistry @xcite , phenomena of interest are related to an atomistic dynamics of a finite fragment of an extended system .",
    "the fragment can not be treated as isolated as it interacts and exchanges energy with the rest of the system serving as a heat bath . as a complete description of the whole system",
    "might be difficult or impossible , one has to look for approaches which pay specific attention to the fragment ( an open system ) , while still retaining the existence of the heat bath .",
    "this problem lies within the realm of _ open quantum dissipative systems _ @xcite .    in the case of classical systems ,",
    "molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations have proven to be a powerful , yet simple , tool for studying their non - equilibrium properties including tribology @xcite , energy dissipation @xcite , crack propagation @xcite , heat transport @xcite and irradiation @xcite . an appropriate theoretical approach for considering dynamics of open _ classical _ systems , based on calculating trajectories of atoms of the open system and accounting for dissipation effects with its environment(s ) , is provided by the generalised langevin equation ( gle ) @xcite . assuming a rather general hamiltonian of the open system and linear coupling to its harmonic heat bath , one arrives at its non - markovian classical dynamics with multivariate gaussian distributed random forces and the memory kernel that is proportional to the random force autocorrelation function ( the second fluctuation - dissipation theorem ) @xcite .",
    "although the gle has been around for a while ( see @xcite and references therein ) , its application to realistic systems has only recently become realised when a powerful implementation of this method has been proposed @xcite .",
    "it solved two main obstacles standing in the way of efficient numerical simulations : its non - markovian character and the coloured noise .",
    "this implementation is also straightforwardly generalised for heat transport simulations which require more than one heat bath @xcite .",
    "although classical md simulations for open systems can be easily justified via gle , a natural question arises of whether something analogous to gle can also be formulated in the quantum realm . by that",
    "we mean equations of motion for the _ expectation values _ of positions of atoms in the open system , @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the exact density matrix at time @xmath3 of the whole combined system , and @xmath2 the operator of the coordinate of atom @xmath7 ) ; the equations are expected to contain a _",
    "non - operator _ ( or @xmath0number ) stochastic force with certain statistical properties . at high enough temperatures ( or in the @xmath8 limit )",
    "the @xmath0number quantum gle must coincide with the classical one for the same hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "using such a tool , one will be able to study , via md - like approaches , dynamical phenomena of a wide range of systems e.g. in quantum optics , condensed matter and chemical physics and nanotechnology , accounting for the full quantum nature of both the bath and the open system .",
    "first attempts to develop a quantum analogue of the classical gle based on equations of motion for heisenberg positions and momenta operators of atoms of an open system were done by ford , kac and mazur ( fkm ) @xcite .",
    "this method has been further developed by other authors @xcite and then applied , in particular , to heat transport @xcite . in this method ,",
    "gle - like non - markovian equations for operators of the open system are obtained assuming a linear coupling to the harmonic bath .",
    "the bath enters these equations via an operator which has a meaning of a force , the latter contains a linear combination of initial bath operators . assuming that initially the bath was at equilibrium at a certain temperature , and hence the reduced density matrix of the bath ( the density matrix of the whole system in which open system degrees of freedom are traced out ) is canonical at a certain temperature",
    ", one can show that the statistically averaged operator of the force is zero and its correlation function is essentially given by the well - known displacement - displacement correlation function calculated in the harmonic approximation .",
    "although this method is exact within the adopted hamiltonian , analytical solutions can only be obtained in simple cases @xcite .",
    "it is essential , that even though the equations themselves are written only for operators of the open system , these operators are still defined in the hilbert space of the whole system ( open system + bath ) . for harmonic systems ,",
    "this approach for heat transport has been shown @xcite to be fully equivalent to the method based on non - equilibrium green s functions @xcite .",
    "note that equations for quantum operators of an open system with linearly coupled harmonic bath can also be derived using path - integral techniques by integrating out the bath variables @xcite .",
    "this method is however based on the so - called partitioned assumption ( initiated by feynman and vernon @xcite ) that the initial density matrix is a direct product of independent density matrices of the open system and bath ( the born approximation @xcite ) .",
    "several attempts have also been made to obtain truly @xmath0number quantum gle ( cqgle ) . in a hybrid approach",
    "@xcite the authors suggested simply to replace , without proper justification , heisenberg equations of motion for operators of positions of atoms of an open system by their classical analogues keeping , at the same time , the fully quantum expression for the random force autocorrelation function ( note that in this approach the random force is not an operator ) .",
    "a more elaborate approach based on a somewhat artificial distribution function for the bath has also been proposed @xcite .",
    "the corresponding ansatz of a coherent state representation provides a connection with the classical gle in the limit of @xmath9 .",
    "however , some _ ad hoc _ , not fully justifiable , assumptions are used for the form of the quantum hamiltonian and the way the quantum thermal averages are performed @xcite .",
    "we also note that in most of the methods mentioned above the bath hamiltonian was represented as a set of independent harmonic oscillators .    here",
    "we offer a fully consistent derivation of cqgle for an open system based on the density matrix method . the born approximation for the initial density matrix of the whole system",
    "is not used , i.e. the whole system initially is not assumed to be partitioned .",
    "we consider a general hamiltonian for the open system which is linearly coupled to the harmonic bath .",
    "one of the advantages of our model is that , similarly to our classical treatment @xcite , the bath and the open system are treated as parts of the same whole system .",
    "we show that , using a plausible so - called `` harmonisation '' approximation , a class of cqgles for the mean values @xmath1 of atoms in the open quantum system can be established .",
    "these equations are non - markovian in nature with a friction kernel which is identical to that found in the classical gle @xcite , while the random force , contrary to the classical case , is non - gaussian .",
    "it is shown to have a zero mean with the pair correlation function being of the same functional form as in the classical case .",
    "next , we establish a connection with the previously developed methods and obtain an explicit expression for the pair correlation function of the random force by assuming that the order in which the stochastic and quantum - mechanical averages are performed must not affect the final result .",
    "consider a system consisting of two parts : a finite open system ( or region 1 ) and an infinite heat bath ( region 2 ) .",
    "correspondingly , subscripts 1 and 2 will be used in vectors and matrices , where appropriate .",
    "we assume that the heat bath is much larger than the system itself and hence can be asigned to have a fixed temperature @xmath10 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the whole system , @xmath11 , contains the hamiltonian of the open system , @xmath12 which assumes an arbitrary potential energy term , @xmath13 , the harmonic bath , @xmath14 and the interaction between the system and bath regions which is assumed to be linear with respect to atomic displcements @xmath15 of the bath atoms : @xmath16 here @xmath17 and @xmath18 are vector - columns of all cartesian coordinates @xmath7 of the atoms in the system and their momenta , respectively ; @xmath19 and @xmath20 are vector - columns of all atomic displacements in the bath and their corresponding momentum operators .",
    "@xmath21 is the bath force - constant matrix , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the diagonal matrices of atomic masses of the system and bath , respectively .",
    "the superscript @xmath10 means transpose .",
    "the vector @xmath24 defines ( minus ) forces with which atoms in the system act on the atoms of the bath ; this vector is assumed to have an arbitrary dependence on @xmath25 .",
    "the above hamiltonian is exactly the same as in the recent classical formulation of the gle equations @xcite .",
    "it is more general than the caldeira - leggett hamiltonian @xcite containing independent harmonic oscillators in the bath and the coupling which is linear in both bath and system coordinates ( the bilinear coupling ) , that is normally used in quantum theories of gle @xcite .",
    "our hamiltonian can be obtained from the full hamiltonian of the whole combined system by expanding it until the second order in terms of atomic displacements in the bath .",
    "hence , its parameters can be taken directly from the adopted hamiltonian of the realistic system under study @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath26 includes the interaction between atoms in the system and their counterparts in the bath which are clumped at their equilibrium positions ; any variation of the system - bath interaction due to the bath atoms vibrating around these positions is accounted for by the rest of the combined bath hamiltonian @xmath27 .",
    "next we introduce the density matrix operator , @xmath6 , for the system and bath , which satisfies the appropriate liouville equation with the full hamiltonian .",
    "we recall @xcite that the general solution of the liouville equation for time - independent hamiltonian @xmath28 is @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 $ ] is the evolution operator , and @xmath32 is the density matrix at the initial time @xmath33 .",

    "<S> we derive a @xmath0number generalised langevin equation ( gle ) describing the evolution of the expectation values @xmath1 of the atomic position operators @xmath2 of an open system . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is coupled linearly to a harmonic bath kept at a fixed temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the equations of motion contain a non - markovian friction term with the classical kernel [ l. kantorovich - prb 78 , 094304 ( 2008 ) ] and a zero mean _ non - gaussian _ random force with correlation functions that depend on the initial preparation of the open system . </S>",
    "<S> we used a density operator formalism without assuming that initially the combined system was decoupled . the only approximation made in deriving quantum gle </S>",
    "<S> consists in assuming that the hamiltonian of the open system at time @xmath3 can be expanded up to the second order with respect to operators of atomic displacements @xmath4 in the open system around their exact atomic positions @xmath1 ( the `` harmonisation '' approximation ) . </S>",
    "<S> the noise is introduced to ensure that sampling many quantum gle trajectories yields exactly the average one . an explicit expression for the pair correlation function of the noise , consistent with the classical limit , </S>",
    "<S> is also proposed . unlike the usually considered quantum operator gle , the proposed @xmath0number quantum gle can be used in direct molecular dynamic simulations of open systems under general equilibrium or non - equilibrium conditions . </S>"
