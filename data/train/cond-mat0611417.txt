    "due to their importance in si technology , states induced by the dangling bonds ( dbs ) on si(100 ) surface , known as @xmath5 centers , have been a topic of study for decades@xcite .",
    "these are important due to their role in introducing states inside the band gap@xcite , fermi level pinning@xcite , charging issue - consider variation of threshold voltage due to charged dbs , reliability issues - consider negative bias temperature instability@xcite , enhancement of 1/f noise due to trap states resulting in poor dc characteristics@xcite . with advances in nanoscale science , detailed understanding of these surface states is needed to exploit their role in possible technological applications , _",
    "e.g. _ use of db as a template for the growth of molecular nanostructures@xcite .",
    "this realization has been the motivation behind research like desorption of h from si surface forming a db@xcite , electronic and electrostatic effect of db on transport through a styrene wire@xcite , db dynamics on si surface@xcite , jahn - teller distortion in db wires at low temperature@xcite , magnetism in db structures@xcite , passivation of dbs with h and d@xcite , etc .",
    "-4 in    watanabe _ _ et al__@xcite predicted that an unpaired db ( si dimer with one hydrogenated atom ) wire on h : si(100)-(2@xmath01 ) surface in the direction along the dimer row would introduce states inside the band gap .",
    "this prediction was later experimentally observed , however the mechanism is still not clear@xcite .",
    "recently , cakmak _ _ et al__@xcite theoretically reproduced their results and found similar trend .",
    "all these calculations were based on density functional theory ( dft ) where band gap is underestimated @xcite .",
    "it is thus hard to quantitatively benchmark the results . in this paper",
    ", we use extended hckel theory ( eht ) for electronic band structure calculations using transferable parameters developed by cerda _ _ et al__@xcite .",
    "notably , eht gives correct si bulk band gap and other features as reported by kienle _",
    "_ et al__@xcite .",
    "it has been applied to si surfaces obtaining satisfactory results@xcite .",
    "the state of the art in electronic structure calculations for si is gw approximation@xcite .",
    "however , computational complexity prohibits its use in transport calculations for large systems like the ones discussed in this paper where the si atoms per unit cell may approach 384 .",
    "eht provides computationally accessible , yet accurate approach .",
    "apart from this , to the best of our knowledge there has not yet been a systematic study of isolated dbs , db wires and db clusters on h : si(100)-(2@xmath01 ) surface using a method that quantitatively addresses the surface states .    in a previous study@xcite",
    ", we report that a db electronically affects si atoms up to approximately 10@xmath4 away from it , by introducing a near - midgap state in the local density of states of the neighboring si atoms .",
    "therefore , to simulate dbs in isolated , wired and clustered configurations , we use a large enough unit cell in the directions parallel to and perpendicular to the dimer row , conveniently referred to as @xmath3 $ ] and [ 110 ] directions respectively @xcite ( as shown in fig .",
    "few large unit cells are shown in fig . 2 to demonstrate the approach .",
    "this approach has been used previously in ref .",

    "i.e. _ direction normal to surface , we simulate a semi - infinite structure by using sixteen layers of si atoms as shown in fig .",
    "1(a - d ) .",
    "the important aspect of this approximation is the use of a large enough unit cell in [ 100 ] direction , which minimizes the quantum confinement effects and the correct si band gap for h : si(100)-(2@xmath01 ) is obtained ( as shown in fig .",

    "3(b ) shows transmission through the above - mentioned three surfaces .",
    "h : si(100)-(2@xmath01 ) surface has a clean band gap , si(100)-(2@xmath01)-ad surface has 0.62ev of band gap and si(100)-(2@xmath01)-sd surface has no band gap .",
    "we present calculations of isolated unpaired db ( si dimer with one atom hydrogenated ) and paired db ( unpassivated si dimer ) in fig .",
    "4(a ) and ( b ) respectively .",
    "an unpaired db introduces a near - midgap state as we previously report@xcite , whereas a paired db introduces a @xmath1 state close to the valence band maximum ( @xmath6 ) and a @xmath2 state close to the conduction band minimum ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "these states due to a paired db are similar to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states introduced by si(100)-(2@xmath01)-ad surface as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) , however dispersion is smaller than that of ad surface states .",
    "we provide details of bandwidths of different states in section iv .",
    "furthermore , we model db wires consisting of unpaired and paired dbs in @xmath3 $ ] and [ 110 ] directions as shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) and ( b ) respectively .",
    "for unpaired db wires , in @xmath3 $ ] and [ 110 ] direction , a near - midgap state similar to that of an isolated unpaired db is introduced .",
    "however , the dispersion in the surface state due to an unpaired db wire in @xmath3 $ ] direction is larger than that of an isolated unpaired db , whereas the dispersion in surface states due to an unpaired db wire in [ 110 ] direction is only slightly larger .",
    "similarly , for wires consisting of paired dbs in @xmath3 $ ] and [ 110 ] direction , @xmath1 and @xmath2 states are introduced close to @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively , which are similar to those introduced by an isolated paired db .",
    "the dispersion in surface states of these wires follow similar pattern as that of unpaired db wires in @xmath3 $ ] and [ 110 ] directions respectively . finally , we report electronic band structure calculations for isolated clusters of dbs as shown in fig .",
    "5 , reporting that electronic structure of clusters can be interpreted as combinations of those of unpaired and paired dbs , but sufficiently dispersed due to interaction within the dbs .",

    "interact electronically over a distance of approximately 10@xmath4 , a ( 4@xmath04 ) unit cell makes certain that dbs in consecutive unit cells are electronically isolated .",

    "qualitatively , we interpret these states as a combination of states due to an unpaired and paired db respectively . however , the dispersion is larger , which we attribute to the mutual couplings of these unpaired and paired dbs .",

    "<S> such induced states have very small dispersion due to their isolation from the other states , which reside in conduction and valence band . on the other hand , the surface state induced due to an unpaired db wire in the direction along the dimer row ( referred to as @xmath3 $ ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , has large dispersion due to the strong coupling between the adjacent dbs , being 3.84@xmath4 apart . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the direction perpendicular to the dimer row ( referred to as [ 110 ] ) , due to the reduced coupling between the dbs being 7.68@xmath4 apart , the dispersion in the surface state is similar to that of an isolated unpaired db . </S>",
    "<S> apart from this , a paired db wire in @xmath3 $ ] direction introduces @xmath1 and @xmath2 states similar to those of an ad surface and a paired db wire in [ 110 ] direction exhibits surface states similar to those of an isolated paired db , as expected . besides this </S>",
    "<S> , we report the electronic structure of different db clusters , which exhibit states inside the band gap that can be interpreted as superpositions of states due to unpaired and paired dbs . </S>"
