    "many complex fluids , whether natural or synthetic in origin , are intrinsically polydisperse in character , that is they comprise mixtures of similar rather than strictly identical constituent particles .",
    "common examples are colloidal dispersions , macromolecules in solution and liquid crystals , where variation amongst the particles can occur in attributes such as their size , shape or surface charge .",
    "polydispersity is of considerable practical relevance because it can affect the properties of materials in a variety of applications such as coating technologies @xcite , foodstuffs @xcite and polymer processing @xcite .",
    "however , from the fundamental perspective , the current understanding of polydisperse fluids is considerably less advanced than that of their monodisperse counterparts .",
    "the reason for this is the inherent complexity that polydispersity imparts to a system , and which generates difficulties for experimental , theoretical and simulation approaches alike .    on the experimental front",
    ", intricate technical issues beset the preparation , characterization and analysis of polydisperse samples , and only relatively recently has work begun to systematically address the generic consequences of polydispersity , such as its effects on phase behaviour and the fractionation of particles of different sizes between coexisting phases @xcite .",
    "as far as analytical theory is concerned , the principal challenge is the multitude of variables required to accurately describe the system s properties .",
    "statistical mechanical theories of polydispersity typically regard the polydisperse attribute as a continuous variable ( @xmath1 , say ) @xcite . accordingly",
    "the system may be regarded as a mixture of an infinite number of species  each labelled by the value of @xmath1 .",
    "it is then natural to describe the polydispersity in terms of a density distribution , @xmath10 , measuring the number density of each species .",
    "difficulties arise , however , when one attempts to determine the thermodynamic properties of the system , such as its phase behaviour .",
    "because the free energy depends on ( is a functional of ) the entire distribution @xmath10 , it occupies a parameter space that is effectively infinite dimensional .",
    "this in turn renders the analysis of phase behaviour much more problematic than for monodisperse systems or finite mixtures of a few components .    for small degrees of polydispersity ,",
    "perturbative approaches permit some theoretical headway to be made @xcite .",
    "a more general approach is the moment free energy ( mfe ) method @xcite . for certain truncatable forms of the free energy use of this method",
    "allows the effective dimensionality of the problem to be reduced to a manageable level by projecting the free energy onto a suitably defined subspace spanned by a few principal moments of @xmath10 .",
    "the phase behaviour of the resulting projected free energy can be calculated relatively straightforwardly .",
    "this method has been applied to investigate a range of open questions related to bulk phase equilibria , including _ ( inter - alia ) _ issues concerned with liquid - vapor coexistence and critical point shifts @xcite , freezing @xcite and liquid crystal phase transitions @xcite .    these advances in theoretical methods for dealing with polydisperse fluids ,",
    "have recently been complemented by parallel developments in simulation methodologies .",
    "new monte carlo ( mc ) algorithms now permit the effective study of polydisperse phase equilibria within the grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) .",
    "use of this ensemble is advantageous for the study of phase transitions because it allows the system density to fluctuate as a whole , thereby catering naturally for both order parameter fluctuations and fractionation effects @xcite . within the gce framework",
    ", polydispersity is controlled by means of a chemical potential distribution @xmath11 , the form of which is adapted ( for each state point of interest ) in such a way as to yield an ensemble averaged density distribution @xmath12 that matches some prescribed form @xmath10 .",
    "this approach extends previous ones ( see eg .",
    "refs.@xcite ) by facilitating the targeting of a _ specific _ density distribution .",
    "it thus corresponds more closely to the experimental situation for polydisperse fluids such as colloids and polymers , where the form of @xmath13 is _ fixed _ by the synthesis of the fluid and only its scale can vary depending on the quantity of solvent present .",
    "the new techniques have recently been applied to obtain the equation of state of polydisperse hard spheres @xcite and to investigate polydispersity - induced alterations to bulk phase behaviour in a lennard - jones fluid @xcite .    while there is considerable ongoing progress in the study of bulk phase behaviour , to date comparatively little",
    "work has been reported regarding the influence of polydispersity on the properties of inhomogeneous fluids @xcite .",
    "one of the standard contemporary theoretical approaches for dealing with such systems is density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown by one of us , that the mfe method outlined above carries over straightforwardly to certain well established density functionals @xcite .",
    "the first such study of an inhomogeneous system considered the prototype model for a inhomogeneous polydisperse fluid , namely hard spheres in the vicinity of a hard wall @xcite .",
    "novel oscillatory behaviour was reported in the local concentration of different sized species as a function of the wall distance .",
    "other dft work has investigated polydisperse polymer / solvent mixtures at coexistence @xcite , and the effect of polydispersity on the fractionation and surface tension of a liquid - gas interface within a van der waals approximation @xcite .",
    "the extension of dft techniques to polydisperse fluids is a welcome development .",
    "however , as yet , the reliability of the approximations inherent in such treatments remain untested . clearly , therefore , it is desirable to obtain benchmarks with which these and other theories of confined polydisperse fluids can be compared . in this paper",
    "we address this issue using mc simulation and dft applied to size - disperse hard spheres at a hard wall . for this purpose",
    "the gce simulation methods developed for the study of the bulk phase equilibria of polydisperse fluids carry over directly , allowing us to probe confinement - induced changes to the density distribution .",
    "in addition to facilitating a detailed comparison between simulation and dft , our results confirm the presence of the oscillatory size segregation effects seen previously in the original dft study , as well as further elucidating the character of the local fluid structure and the effects of depletion interactions near the wall .",
    "our article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] we outline the mc simulation scheme and the density functional theory . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we analyse and compare in detail the mc and dft results for two choices of the parent size distribution at two volume fractions .",
    "finally , a discussion of the results and the prospects for interesting further work features in sec .",
    "[ sec : concs ] .",
    "the system with which we shall be concerned is a fluid of hard spheres , whose polydisperse attribute @xmath1 corresponds to the sphere diameter .",
    "pairs of particles @xmath14 and @xmath15 are assumed to interact via the potential    @xmath16    consider initially such a system in the bulk .",
    "conventionally the state of the system is described by a `` parent '' density distribution @xcite @xmath10 , which can be written    @xmath17    here @xmath18 is the overall particle number density , while @xmath19 is the system volume and @xmath20 is a normalized shape function , the relative width of which is quantified by the dimensionless degree of polydispersity :    @xmath21    measuring the standard deviation of the parent distribution , normalized by its mean .",
    "let us now break the translational symmetry of the system in one coordinate direction ( @xmath2 , say ) by introducing a hard wall in the plane @xmath22 .",
    "interactions of the particles with the wall are assumed to be controlled by the potential :    @xmath23    near such a wall , modifications to bulk behaviour arise even in monodisperse systems from standard packing effects .",
    "for polydisperse systems , however , additional factors come into play .",
    "firstly , the excluded volume constraint associated with @xmath24 implies that the centers of small particles are permitted to approach the wall more closely than those of large particles .",
    "hence one expects ( for sufficiently small @xmath2 ) that the local density distribution will be truncated at large @xmath1 with respect to the bulk ( parent ) form . secondly , experience with binary hard sphere mixtures @xcite suggest that very close to the wall one can expect attractive depletion interactions between the particles and the wall . in the polydisperse case",
    "these depletion forces should be @xmath1-dependent . in order to quantify the net influence of all these effects",
    ", we consider the ensemble averaged local density distribution @xmath0 at a perpendicular distance @xmath2 from the wall :    @xmath25    in the present work , we have elected to study two forms of the parent distribution : a top - hat distribution and a schulz , the form of which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dists ] .",
    "the top - hat distribution is defined by    @xmath26    where ( without loss of generality ) , the mean particle diameter has been set to @xmath27 .",
    "we have studied the cases @xmath28 and @xmath29 , for which @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "the schulz distribution is defined by the shape function    @xmath32\\:.\\ ] ]    here the parameter @xmath2 controls the width of the distribution and thence the value of @xmath8 .",
    "we have considered the case @xmath33 , corresponding to @xmath34 .",
    "again , by construction , @xmath27 . notice that in contrast to eg .",
    "a gaussian , the schulz distribution vanishes smoothly ( has a natural cutoff ) as @xmath35 . for the purposes of the mc simulations described below ,",
    "however , one does require an upper cutoff in @xmath1 .",
    "we chose to truncate @xmath20 at @xmath36 , which reduces the degree of polydispersity to @xmath37 .",
    "the truncated form of @xmath20 was then rescaled to unit integrated area . given this truncation ,",
    "the population of particles at the cutoff diameter is very small compared to those having the mean diameter : @xmath38 .",
    "however , the volume of the largest allowed particle is @xmath39 times that of one having the mean diameter .",
    "a quantity useful in characterizing a polydisperse system is its volume fraction , which provides a measure of the degree to which the particles pack the available space",
    ". we shall employ it in preference to the number density @xmath40 which does not alone provide equivalent information .",
    "we define the volume fraction in terms of the _ bulk _ parent distribution :    @xmath41    for a nominated shape function @xmath20 , choosing a value for @xmath42 ( or equivalently @xmath40 ) serves to fix the bulk chemical potential distribution @xmath11 .",
    "the assumption that the confined fluid exists in equilibrium with a bulk reservoir then implies that both the bulk and confined systems have equal @xmath11 .",
    "note however , that for the confined hard sphere systems we consider here , the system - averaged volume fraction is generally less than that of the reservoir . for both the top - hat and schulz parents described above",
    ", we consider the cases @xmath3 and @xmath4 .    with regard to our use of scales",
    ", we shall throughout express all lengths in units of the average particle diameter @xmath43 of the parent distribution .",
    "owing to the lack of a temperature scale in hard sphere systems , we implicitly adopt the convention of assigning @xmath44 .",
    "the grand canonical metropolis monte carlo algorithm we have employed has previously been described in ref .",
    "@xcite and involves particle insertions , deletions , translations , and resizing operations .",
    "particle resizing operations @xmath45 , or the insertion of a new particle are performed by drawing a random number with uniform probability in the range of allowed sizes .",
    "acceptance / rejection criteria for these moves involve not only the change in the particle - particle and particle - wall potentials , but also the change in the chemical potentials @xmath11 and @xmath46 .",
    "translational moves @xmath47 are not strictly necessary in the gce formalism , as they are equivalent to the successive deletion of particle @xmath48 and insertion of particle @xmath49 , but their use proved beneficial to the sampling efficiency at the higher local volume fractions encountered near the wall .    within the gce framework",
    ", the form of the ensemble averaged density distribution @xmath12 is controlled by its conjugate chemical potential distribution @xmath11 . in order to perform simulations of a prescribed parent distribution one",
    "therefore needs to match @xmath12 to @xmath10 in a bulk ( or , in our case , fully periodic ) simulation .",
    "unfortunately , the task of determining the requisite @xmath11 is complicated by the fact that it is a",
    "_ functional _ of @xmath10 .",
    "effectively therefore , one is faced with solving the inverse problem @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "doing so is facilitated by a recently proposed mc scheme  the non - equilibrium potential refinement ( nepr ) algorithm @xcite use of which enables the efficient iterative determination of @xmath51 $ ] , from a single simulation run , and without the need for an initial guess of its form . to achieve this ,",
    "the method continually updates @xmath11 in such a way as to correct for the deviation of the instantaneous density distribution @xmath13 from the target form ( i.e.  the parent ) .",
    "however , tuning @xmath11 in this manner clearly violates detailed balance . to counter this",
    ", successive iterations reduce the degree of modification applied to @xmath11 , thereby driving the system towards equilibrium and ultimately yielding the equilibrium form of @xmath51 $ ] .    in order to obtain the bulk form of @xmath11 corresponding to the top - hat and schulz distributions at @xmath52 and @xmath53 , the nepr algorithm was deployed in simulations of a fully periodic cubic simulation cell of side @xmath54 .",
    "the resulting forms of @xmath11 for the respective parents were then used to study the effects of introducing two oppositely facing hard walls at @xmath22 and @xmath55 ( the system remaining periodic in the @xmath56 and @xmath57 directions ) .",
    "the cell size @xmath54 proved sufficient to ensure that the fluid properties at the cell midpoint were indistinguishable ( to within statistical uncertainty ) from those of the fully periodic system .",
    "this finding was further tested by comparing the results with those for a cell that was elongated along the @xmath2 direction , having @xmath58 . again within statistical uncertainties , no differences were observed , leading us to conclude that the two walls do not interact with one another and that the properties near one wall are representative of the semi - infinite geometry",
    ".    the particle density @xmath0 was accumulated in the form of a histogram in the course of the simulations and will be the object of our analysis in the next section .",
    "the histogram was formed by discretising the permitted ranges @xmath59 and @xmath60 , into bins .",
    "the bin width in @xmath1 used for the top - hat distributions was @xmath61 , while @xmath62 was employed for the schulz .",
    "the bin width in the @xmath2 direction was @xmath63 for the top - hat distributions and @xmath64 for the schulz distribution .",
    "the density functional model employed is that introduced by rosenfeld  @xcite , following the implementation proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and corresponds to a weighted functional that has proved accurate for monodisperse systems  @xcite .",
    "although improvements have been proposed to the original rosenfeld model which appear to perform better in the context of describing crystalline phases , we do not expect our implementation to suffer major drawbacks for the regimes of volume fraction regimes of interest in the present work .",
    "the free energy functional can be expressed as :    @xmath65\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\left.[v(\\sigma,{\\bf r})-\\mu(\\sigma)]\\rho(\\sigma,{\\bf r})\\right\\}+\\int d{\\bf r}{\\cal f}^{ex}[m_{\\alpha}({\\bf r } ) ] \\label{eq : modelf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the excess contribution to the free energy functional , @xmath66 , is a function of four moments only :    @xmath67    the four weight functions , @xmath68 ( non - local in space ) are chosen to recover the percus - yevick free energy and correlation functions for a homogeneous mixture . in the bulk",

    "the advantage of the moment structure of the functional is that the excess chemical potential of each species is    @xmath76    and can be interpreted as a linear combination of the four moment excess chemical potentials , @xmath77 .",
    "this moment structure simplifies the study of polydisperse mixtures @xcite .    for the case of a fluid mixture in the presence of a planar hard wall",
    ", the external potential reduces to eq.([eq : upw ] ) : @xmath78 .",
    "the equilibrium density profiles , as given implicitly in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhoeq ] ) , are found numerically via iteration . to this end , it is necessary to define an underlying lattice and to represent the parent distribution as a set of discrete species .",
    "however , the existence of this lattice imposes a minimum resolvable length scale ( lattice cutoff ) . to avoid lattice artifacts",
    ", one must therefore apply a lower cutoff to the parent distribution @xmath10 which is itself large compared to the lattice spacing ; we take the lower @xmath1 cutoff to vary between 20 and 50 lattice units .",
    "although in principle , this cutoff may lead to discrepancies between the dft and mc results ( in the simulations particles can have a vanishingly small radius ) , we have verified that the lower cutoff is sufficiently small that changes to its value have negligible effect on the overall results .",
    "depending on the degree of polydispersity , the continuous parent distribution is represented by a few hundred species , ensuring always that the maximum sized species has a sufficiently small contribution to avoid spurious effects from the upper @xmath1 cutoff . for consistency",
    ", we choose the upper cutoff to equal that used in the simulations . the mean particle diameter is always taken as the reference length scale in the calculations .",
    "below we present our findings for the effect of the hard wall on the density distribution . for the purposes of gauging the accuracy of the dft predictions ,",

    "also shown for comparison in each case is the form of @xmath84 for monodisperse hard spheres ( with @xmath86 ) at the same respective volume fraction and normalized so that its value at @xmath87 matches the density profile of the @xmath86 species in the polydisperse system .",

    ", we note that an aspect peculiar to the narrow top - hat parent distribution is that @xmath84 oscillates with a period @xmath90 ( i.e. close to @xmath43 ) for all particle sizes .",
    "this contrasts with the case of the much wider schulz distribution , where the oscillations do not appear to be controlled by the average particle size , having a considerably larger wavelength in @xmath2 .",
    "we note further that in all cases studied , the oscillations in @xmath84 induced by the wall are more pronounced for the monodisperse fluid than for the polydisperse ones . thus the effect of polydispersity appears to be to dampen the profile oscillations .",
    "this is presumably a result of structural disordering effects deriving from the ability of small particles to occupy the gaps between large ones .",
    "these in turn serve to disrupt the excluded volume packing effects which underly the density oscillations commonly observed in monodisperse systems near a hard wall .",
    "within this qualitative picture , one would thus expect a greater dampening of the oscillations for the schulz distribution than for the narrow top - hat , on account of the disparity in their values of @xmath8 .",
    "this indeed appears to be the case , with the top - hat profiles resembling more closely the monodisperse case .    turning next to the comparison of the simulation measurements with the results of the dft calculations , it is gratifying to note that the level of agreement is generally excellent , particularly at the lower volume fraction . only for the case",

    "note , however , that the effective potential @xmath98 defined in eq.([eq : phieff ] ) should not be confused with a true two - body depletion potential .",
    "a relationship similar to eq.([eq : phieff ] ) has been used to quantify fluid - wall depletion effects in asymmetrical binary mixtures comprising large ( colloid ) particles in a solvent of small particles ( such as polymer ) .",

    "in contrast to the case of the narrow top - hat , for the schulz parent the density of the largest permitted particles ( i.e. those allowed by the geometrical constraint at a given @xmath2 ) always exceeds the bulk density at that @xmath1 ( cf . fig .  [",

    "[ eq : deltanarrow ] indicates that for a narrow parent the local deviations in the width of the distribution depend on second and higher moments of the parent . as a result , in this limit",
    "the local variations of the mean density make a relevant contribution to @xmath8 .",
    "this is confirmed by fig .",
    "[ fig : polyz](a ) which shows that the oscillations are indeed anticorrelated with those of the mean species .",
    "in fact , the amplitude of the term @xmath122 is around @xmath123 for a flat parent with @xmath79 and around @xmath124 for @xmath100 .",
    "since the deviations of @xmath120 are never larger than unity for the parameters considered ( see e.g. fig . 2 in ref.@xcite ) , this explains the relative weakness of the oscillations in fig .",
    "[ fig : polyz](a ) .",
    "it also helps to explain the behavior of fig .",
    "[ fig : polyz](b ) ( although in this case one is far from the narrow limit ) : for a schulz distribution @xmath125 and hence the correction in eq.([eq : deltanarrow ] ) vanishes .",
    "accordingly , in a schulz distribution the shape corrections to @xmath9 will become significant only at large @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , comparing @xmath9 for @xmath100 between the schulz and top hat parents ( fig .  [",
    "fig : polyz ] ) , one can see that for a schulz the shape of the local degree of polydispersity follows more closely the density profile of the mean species .",
    "although we have used a definition of the local polydispersity that generalized the conventional form  ( eq.[eq : poly ] ) used to describe bulk parent forms , it is interesting to note that , at least for inhomogeneous systems , a definition of @xmath9 based on the local concentration , @xmath126 , rather than on the local number density , serves to better illustrate the role of polydispersity effects .",
    "accordingly we form a narrow limit expansion of    @xmath127^{1/2}}{\\int d\\sigma \\sigma \\phi(\\sigma , z)}\\:,\\ ] ]    which yields , @xmath128\\left[\\tilde{c}^\\prime(z)-\\tilde{c}^\\prime(\\infty)\\right]\\right\\}\\:.\\ ] ] one sees that this last expression does not depend on the local density of the mean species ; accordingly we would generically expect a much weaker variation of @xmath129 for a schulz , and for other asymmetric parents .",
    "this alternative definition of the local polydispersity thus highlights the fact that in the narrow limit the local segregation of species tends to preserve the width of the parent imposed in the bulk .",
    "in summary we have employed specialized mc simulations techniques and dft to study the effects of a hard wall on the properties of polydisperse hard spheres .",
    "bulk phase ( parent ) distributions of the top - hat and schulz forms were considered . in the former case ,",
    "degree of polydispersity @xmath79 and @xmath100 were studied , while in the latter case , @xmath99 was used . in all cases",
    "the density distribution @xmath0 was obtained and analyzed for bulk volume fractions @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the original motivation for this study was a desire to gauge the accuracy of the dft predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite via a like - for - like comparison with simulation .",
    "the results presented in sec .  [ sec : results ] demonstrate that the agreement is extremely good .",
    "indeed , the dft calculations provide a quantitatively accurate description of the system properties at @xmath52 for both parent forms studied . even for the higher volume fraction @xmath53 ,",
    "the agreement is semi - quantitative .",
    "clearly this finding bodes well for the future utility of dft in investigating other polydispersity related issues in inhomogeneous fluid .    beyond this",
    ", the present study extends that of ref .",
    "@xcite by considering the nature of the attractive depletion interactions in the vicinity of the hard wall .",
    "analysis of contact values showed a clear preference for the largest particles to occupy positions in which their surfaces touch the wall .",
    "indeed for the schulz distribution , the contact values of particles at the cutoff exceeded that in the bulk by over two orders of magnitude .",
    "interestingly , at a given @xmath42 , the degree of contact enhancement as a function of @xmath1 , seems quite insensitive to the distribution shape ( cf .",
    "[ fig : contval](c ) ) for a given @xmath8 .",
    "this finding was found to extend to the form of the effective potentials ( fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] ) near the wall . clearly however our comparison is far from exhaustive in this regard and further studies would be required to determine whether this observation applies more generally .",
    "the interplay of the @xmath1-dependent attractive depletion forces and the geometrical constraint imposed by the wall was found to radically alter the local size distribution .",
    "indeed in the case of the schulz parent at @xmath53 , a minimum in @xmath83 was observed to develop within a certain range of @xmath2 .",
    "another interesting feature , was the appearance of oscillatory structure in the local degree of polydispersity @xmath9 .",
    "this was accompanied , very close to the wall , by considerable reduction in the local degree of polydispersity with respect to the bulk .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that this latter finding may have some bearing on recent experimental observations of wall induced freezing in a polydisperse system of colloidal hard spheres that apparently forms a glass in the bulk @xcite .",
    "polydispersity is known to hinder freezing in colloidal systems @xcite , and consequently any narrowing of @xmath13 due to the presence of a wall may serve to promote the formation of an ordered crystal phase .    with regard to the size segregation effects originally reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , we find that the anti - correlation in the oscillations of the local concentration between the largest and smallest permitted particles is significantly more pronounced for small @xmath8 than for large @xmath8 at a given @xmath111 .",
    "furthermore as for small @xmath8 , the period of the oscillations in @xmath2 appears to be close to that of the mean particle diameter .",
    "both these findings are in accord with the predictions of perturbative calculations @xcite . for large @xmath8 , by contrast , the present work shows that distribution shape effects _ are _ important in determining the character of size segregation effects .",
    "thus for the schulz parent at @xmath130 , the degree of anti - correlation is much less than for the corresponding top - hat parent .",
    "additionally , in the latter case the period of the oscillations appear to be more consistent with the average particle size than for the schulz distribution .",
    "this suggests that it is the presence in the schulz parent of relatively large higher order moments which leads to this increased disruption of size - segregation effects .",
    "analogous observations apply to the density profiles @xmath82 themselves . in all cases , ( but especially for the schulz parent ) , the presence of polydispersity was found to dampen the density oscillations significantly compared to the monodisperse profile @xmath84 .",
    "turning finally to the outlook for further related work , an interesting open question is whether size segregation effects analogous to those considered here for an inhomogeneous system might also occur in bulk polydisperse fluids",
    "i.e. whether pairs of hard spheres of prescribed sizes @xmath1 and @xmath131 are preferentially found with certain separations",
    ". this could be investigated by appeal to the measured form of the pair distribution function @xmath132 .",
