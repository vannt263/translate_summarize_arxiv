    "in this article it will be reported upon an analysis of hard exclusive electroproduction of positively charged pions  @xcite within the frame work of the so - called handbag approach which offers a partonic description of meson electroproduction provided the virtuality of the exchanged photon , @xmath2 , is sufficiently large .",
    "the theoretical basis of the handbag approach is the factorization of the process amplitudes in hard partonic subprocesses and soft hadronic matrix elements , parameterized as generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) , as well as wave functions for the produced mesons , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . in collinear approximation factorization has been shown  @xcite to hold rigorously for exclusive meson electroproduction in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "it has also been shown that the transitions from a longitudinally polarized photon to the pion , @xmath4 , dominates at large @xmath2 .",
    "transitions from transversely polarized photons to pions , @xmath1 , are suppressed by inverse powers of the hard scale .    however , as has been argued in ref .",
    ", @xmath1 transitions are quite large at experimentally accessible values of @xmath2 which are typically of the order of a few @xmath5 .",
    "this follows from data of asymmetries measured with a transversely polarized target  @xcite and is also seen in the transverse cross section measured by the @xmath6 collaboration  @xcite .",
    "it is demonstrated in ref .",
    "that within the handbag approach , these @xmath1 transitions can be calculated as a twist-3 effect consisting of the leading - twist helicity - flip gpds  @xcite combined with the twist-3 pion distribution amplitude  @xcite . in the following the main ideas of the approach advocated for in ref .   will be briefly described and some of the results will be discussed and compared to experiment .",
    "within the handbag approach the amplitudes for pion electroproduction through longitudinally polarized photons read @xmath7\\,,\\nonumber\\\\ { \\cal m}^{\\pi^+}_{0-,0 + } & = & \\frac{e_0}{q}\\,\\frac{\\sqrt{-t^\\prime}}{2m}\\,\\big [ \\xi   \\langle \\widetilde{e}^{(3)}\\rangle + 2mq^2\\frac{\\rho_\\pi}{t - m_\\pi^2}\\big]\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : l - amplitudes}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the usual abbreviation @xmath8 is employed where @xmath9 is the minimal value of @xmath10 corresponding to forward scattering .",
    "the mass of the nucleon is denoted by @xmath11 and the skewness parameter , @xmath12 , is related to bjorken-@xmath13 by @xmath14 helicity flips at the baryon vertex are taken into account since they are only suppressed by @xmath15 .",
    "in contrast to this , effects of order @xmath16 are neglected .",
    "the last term in each of the above amplitudes is the contribution from the pion pole ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "its residue reads @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the familiar pion - nucleon coupling constant .",
    "the structure of the pion and the nucleon is taken into account by form factors , the electromagnetic one for the pion , @xmath19 , whereby the small virtuality of the exchanged pion is as usual ignored , and @xmath20 for the @xmath21-nucleon vertex .",
    "the pion - pole term has been used in essentially this form in the measurement of the pion form factor  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to other work on hard exclusive pion electroproduction ( an exception is ref . )",
    "the full pion form factor is taken into account this way and not only its so - called perturbative contribution which only amounts to about a third of its experimental value .",
    "it is to be stressed that the pion pole also contributes to the amplitudes for transversely polarized photons .",
    "however , these contributions are very small  @xcite .    the convolutions @xmath22 in ( [ eq : l - amplitudes ] )",
    "have been worked out in ref .   with subprocess amplitudes calculated within the modified perturbative approach  @xcite . in this approach",
    "the quark transverse momenta are retained in the subprocess and sudakov suppressions are taken into account .",
    "the partons are still emitted and re - absorbed by the nucleon collinearly , i.e.  we still have collinear factorization in gpds and hard subprocess amplitudes .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that within this variant of the handbag approach the data on cross sections and spin density matrix elements for vector - meson production are well fitted for small values of skewness ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the electroproduction cross sections measured with a transversely or longitudinally polarized target consist of many terms , each can be projected out by @xmath24 or @xmath25 moments where @xmath26 is a specific linear combination of @xmath27 , the azimuthal angle between the lepton and the hadron plane and @xmath28 , the orientation of the target spin vector . a number of these moments have been measured recently  @xcite . a particularly striking result is the @xmath29 moment . the data on it , displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , exhibit a mild @xmath10-dependence and do not show any indication for a turnover towards zero for @xmath30 .",
    "this behavior of @xmath31 at small @xmath32 can only be produced by an interference term between the two helicity non - flip amplitudes @xmath33 and @xmath34 which are not forced to vanish in the forward direction by angular momentum conservation .",
    "the amplitude @xmath34 has to be sizeable because of the large size of the @xmath35 moment .",
    "we therefore have to conclude that there are strong contributions from @xmath36 transitions at moderately large values of @xmath2 .    [ tab:1 ]",
    "how can this amplitude be modeled in the frame work of the handbag approach ? from fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] where the helicity configuration of the amplitude @xmath34 is shown , it is clear that contributions from the usual helicity non - flip gpds , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , to this amplitude do not have the properties required by the data on the @xmath35 moment . for these gpds",
    "the emitted and re - absorbed partons from the nucleon have the same helicity .",
    "consequently , there are net helicity flips of one unit at both the parton - nucleon vertex and the subprocess .",
    "angular momentum conservation therefore forces both parts to vanish as @xmath39 .",
    "thus , a contribution from the ordinary gpds to @xmath34 vanishes @xmath40 .",
    "there is a second set of leading - twist gpds , the helicity - flip or transversity ones @xmath41  @xcite for which the emitted and re - absorbed partons have opposite helicities . as an inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] reveals the parton - nucleon vertex as well as the subprocess amplitude @xmath42 are now of helicity non - flip nature and are therefore not forced to vanish in the forward direction .",
    "the prize to pay is that quark and anti - quark forming the pion have the same helicity .",
    "therefore , the twist-3 pion wave function is needed instead of the familiar twist-2 one .",
    "the dynamical mechanism building up the amplitude @xmath34 is so of twist-3 accuracy .",
    "it has been first proposed in ref .   for wide - angle photo- and electroproduction of mesons where @xmath43 is considered to be the large scale  @xcite .",
    "allowing only for @xmath44 as the only transversity gpd in an admittedly rough approximation the twist-3 mechanism only contributes to the amplitude @xmath45 for the calculation of the subprocess amplitude @xmath42 the twist-3 pion wave function is taken from ref .   with the three - particle fock component neglected  @xcite .",
    "this wave function contains a pseudo - scalar and a tensor component .",
    "the latter one provides a contribution to @xmath34 which is proportional to @xmath46 and , hence , neglected . the contribution from the pseudo - scalar component to @xmath34",
    "has the required properties .",
    "it is proportional to the parameter @xmath47 which appears as a consequence of the divergency of the axial - vector current .",
    "since @xmath48 and @xmath49 are current quark masses @xmath50 is large , actually @xmath51 at the scale of @xmath52 .",
    "thus , although parametrically suppressed by @xmath53 as compared to the longitudinal amplitudes , the twist-3 effect is sizeable for @xmath54 of the order of a few gev .",
    "for @xmath0 electroproduction the gpds , namely @xmath37 , the non - pole part of @xmath38 and the most important one of the transversity gpds , @xmath44 , contribute in the isovector combination @xmath55 the gpds are constructed with the help of double distributions ansatz  @xcite consisting of the product of the zero - skewness gpds and an appropriate weight function , actually parameterized as a power of the valence fock state meson distribution amplitude .",
    "this weight function generates the skewness dependence of the gpd .",
    "it is important to note that other methods to generate the skewness dependence , namely the shuvaev transform  @xcite or the dual parameterization  @xcite lead to very similar results for the gpds at small skewness .",
    "the zero - skewness gpds in the double distribution ansatz are assumed to be given by products of their respective forward limits and regge - like @xmath10 dependences , @xmath56}$ ] , with profile functions that read @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the slope of an appropriate regge trajectory ( pole or cut ) .",
    "these profile functions can be regarded as small-@xmath13 approximations of more complicated versions used for the determination of the zero - skewness gpds from the nucleon form factors  @xcite @xmath59 which hold at all @xmath13 .",
    "there is a strong correlation between @xmath10 and @xmath13 in this ansatz : the behavior of moments or convolutions of a gpd at small ( large ) @xmath43 is determined by the small ( large ) @xmath13 behavior of this gpd .",
    "it is to be stressed that the analysis performed in ref .   as well as",
    "recent results from lattice qcd  @xcite clearly rule out a factorization of the zero - skewness gpds in @xmath13 and @xmath10 .",
    "the forward limit of @xmath37 is given by the polarized parton distributions @xmath60 , that of @xmath44 by the transversity distribution @xmath61 for which the results of an analysis of the asymmetries in semi - inclusive electroproduction have been taken  @xcite .",
    "finally , the forward limit of the non - pole part of @xmath38 is parameterized as @xmath62 in analogy to the pdfs .",
    "the normalization @xmath63 is fitted to experiment .",
    "the full set of parameters used in the analysis of @xmath0 electroproduction can be found in ref .  .",
    "the full gpd @xmath64 is the sum of the pole and non - pole contribution where the first one reads @xmath65 here , @xmath66 is the pion s distribution amplitude and @xmath67 is the pseudo - scalar form factor of the nucleon being related to @xmath64 by the sum rule @xmath68 the evaluation of the pion electroproduction amplitude from the graph shown on the left hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] just using @xmath69 leads to the pion - pole contribution as given in ( [ eq : l - amplitudes ] ) but with only the perturbative contribution to the pion s electromagnetic form factor occurring in the residue ( [ residue ] ) .",
    "other graphs have to be considered in addition for the pion pole , e.g.  the feyman mechanism .",
    "in order to avoid this complication the pion - pole contribution is simply worked out from the graph shown on the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .    in summary",
    ": the gpds used in ref .",
    "are valid at small skewness ( @xmath70 ) and are probed by experiment for @xmath71 . due to the double distribution ansatz they satisfy polynomiality and the reduction formulas .",
    "it has also been checked numerically that the lowest moments of the gpds @xmath37 and @xmath38 are in agreement with the data on the axial - vector  @xcite and pseudo - scalar  @xcite form factors of the nucleon ( see fig .  [ fig:3 ] ) and respect various positivity bounds  @xcite .",
    "comparison with recent lattice qcd studies  @xcite reveals that there is good agreement with the relative strength of moments and their relative @xmath10 dependences . at small @xmath10",
    "even the absolute values of the moments agree quite well but the @xmath10 dependence of the moments obtained from lattice qcd are usually flatter than those from the gpds and the form factor data .",
    "an exception is the lowest moment of @xmath44 for @xmath72 quarks for which we have a value that is about @xmath73 smaller than the lattice result .",
    "similar observation can be made for the gpds @xmath74 and @xmath75 which have been constructed analogously and probed in vector meson electroproduction  @xcite . as an example",
    "the axial - vector form factor obtained from @xmath37 as used in ref . is compared with experiment and with the lattice qcd results in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "that with the described gpds , the @xmath0 cross sections as measured by hermes  @xcite are nicely fitted as well as the transverse target asymmetries  @xcite .",
    "this can be seen for instance from fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] where @xmath31 is displayed .",
    "also the @xmath76 moment which is dominantly fed by an interference term of the two amplitudes for longitudinally polarized photons , is fairly well described as is obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "very interesting is also the asymmetry for a longitudinally polarized target .",
    "it is dominated by an interference term between @xmath34 which comprises the twist-3 effect , and the nucleon helicity - flip amplitude for @xmath4 transition , @xmath77 .",
    "results for @xmath78 are displayed and compared to the data in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] . in both the cases , @xmath31 and @xmath78 ,",
    "the prominent role of the twist-3 mechanism is clearly visible .",
    "switching it off one obtains the dashed lines which are significantly at variance with experiment . in this case",
    "the transverse amplitudes are only fed by the pion - pole contribution .",
    "although the main purpose of the work presented in ref .   is focused on the analysis of the hermes data one may also be interested in comparing this approach to the jefferson lab data on the cross sections  @xcite . with the gpds @xmath79 and @xmath44 in their present form",
    "the agreement with these data is poor .",
    "i remind the reader that the approach advocated for in refs .   and",
    "is optimized for small skewness . at larger values of it",
    "the parameterizations of the gpds are perhaps to simple and may require improvements as for instance the replacement of the profile function ( [ profile1 ] ) by ( [ profile2 ] ) .",
    "as mentioned above the gpds are probed by the hermes data only for @xmath13 less than about 0.6 .",
    "one may therefore change the gpds at large @xmath13 to some extent without changing much the results for cross sections and asymmetries in the kinematical region of small skewness . for jefferson lab kinematics , on the other hand , such changes of the gpds may matter . finally one should be aware that at larger values of skewness the other transversity gpds may not be negligible . in a recent lattice study  @xcite the moments of the combination @xmath80 have been found to be rather large in comparison to those of @xmath44 . including this combination of gpds into the analysis of pion electroproduction one would have @xmath81 { \\cal h}_{0-,++ } \\label{twist-3 - 2}\\ ] ] in addition to ( [ twist-3 ] ) . here , @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) labels the photon helicity .",
    "the amplitude ( [ twist-3 - 2 ] ) holds up to corrections of order @xmath12 .",
    "in summary , there is strong evidence for transversity in hard exclusive electroproduction of pions .",
    "a most striking effect is seen in the target asymmetry @xmath84 .",
    "the interpretation of this effect requires a large helicity non - flip amplitude @xmath34 . within the handbag approach this amplitude",
    "is generated by the helicity - flip or transversity gpds in combination with a twist-3 pion wave function .",
    "this explanation establishes an interesting connection to transversity parton distributions measured in inclusive processes .",
    "further studies of transversity in exclusive reactions are certainly demanded .",
    "good data on @xmath85 electroproduction would also be welcome .",
    "they would not only allow for further tests of the twist-3 mechanism but also give the opportunity to verify the model gpds @xmath37 and @xmath38 as used in ref .   .",
    "an intriguing issue is whether or not the handbag approach in its present form for pion electroproduction works for the kinematics presently accessible at jlab .",
    "it is known that it can not accommodate the clas data on @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 production  @xcite .",
    "other applications and tests of the handbag approach including the twist-3 mechanism are pion electroproduction measured at the upgraded jlab accelerator or by the compass collaboration and the measurement of the time - like process @xmath89",
    "the extension of this approach to electroproduction of other pseudoscalar mesons , in particular the @xmath90 and @xmath91 , is also of interest . in principle",
    "this would give access to the gpds for strange quarks .",
    "as has been shown in ref .   there is no complication in the analysis of the electroproduction data due to the two - gluon fock components of the @xmath90 and @xmath91 since they are suppressed by @xmath46 .",
