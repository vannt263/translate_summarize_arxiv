    "a future quantum computer has the advantage of simulating physical systems and solving certain problems more efficiently than classical computers @xcite .",
    "classical computer use bits as basic units of information whereas quantum computers use qubits ( two - level systems ) as basic units of information . unlike bits",
    ", qubits can exist in coherent superposition of the two basic states @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "moreover quantum - mechanical systems can be entangled. entanglement is purely a quantum - mechanical property which has no classical analogue .",
    "two quantum systems when entangled show non - local correlations which can not be defined by classical statistical predictions",
    ". however , such quantum mechanical behavior is restricted not only to qubits but exists in all higher dimensional systems called qudits @xcite . the degree of non - local correlations are in fact greater in case of entangled qutrits ( three - level systems ) than entangled qubits @xcite .",
    "several cryptographic protocols have been devised using qutrits which are argued to be highly secure against symmetric attacks@xcite .",
    "recently it has also been demonstrated that qutrits can be useful for certain purposes of quantum simulation @xcite , quantum computations @xcite and quantum communication @xcite . among the various physical systems on which quantum simulations and algorithms have been experimentally realized , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr )",
    "has proved to be the most successful to date @xcite . in most of the studies coupled spin-1/2 nuclei",
    "have been used which simulate multiqubit systems .",
    "quadrupolar nuclei have also been used in nmr to mimic qubit systems , whereby spin-3/2 and 7/2 nuclei act as 2 and 3-qubit systems respectively @xcite . in this work",
    "we realize a single qutrit system using nucleus of a deuteron ( spin-1 ) oriented in a liquid crystal matrix .",
    "the quadrupole moment of spin-1 coupled to the electric field gradient in an anisotropic environment lifts the degeneracy of the various dipolar transitions in a strong magnetic field , allowing the three level system to be treated as a `` qutrit '' .",
    "we prepare pseudopure states and perform all the possible one - to - one reversible operations on this qutrit system . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this is the first implementation of quantum information processing in qutrit system by nmr spectroscopy .",
    "it is worth mentioning that qutrit systems have also been realized in trapped - ions recently @xcite .",
    "a qutrit has three states @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "a natural choice for qutrit is a nucleus with three energy levels .",
    "such a nucleus commonly used in nmr spectroscopy is deuterium ( @xmath6h ) which has nuclear spin-1 and significant quadrupole moment .",
    "the energy levels of deuterium in a strong magnetic field are schematically given in fig .",
    "1(a ) along with the equilibrium populations . in a strong magnetic field ( b@xmath7 ) and",
    "an isotropic environment the quadrupolar coupling is averaged to zero ; consequently , the energy levels of deuterium are equispaced . hence the two single quantum transitions ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) overlap leading to indistinguishibility and causing problems with addressability .",
    "however , when introduced in a liquid crystalline matrix , the system becomes anisotropically oriented with respect to b@xmath7 , yielding finite quadrupolar coupling .",
    "the resonance frequencies of the two single quantum transitions then become non - degenerate , giving well resolved spectra ( fig.1(a ) ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of a quadrupolar nucleus partially oriented in a liquid crystalline matrix , in the presence of a large magnetic field @xmath10 and having a first - order quadrupolar coupling , is given by @xcite ; @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the resonance frequency , @xmath13 being the gyro - magnetic ratio , @xmath14 is the order parameter at the site of the nucleus , @xmath15 is the quadrupolar coupling and @xmath16 is its effective value .",
    "though @xmath15 is of the order of several mhz , a small value for the order parameter ( @xmath14 ) converts the effective quadrupolar coupling ` @xmath17 ' into several hz .",
    "the sample used in this study is a lyotropic liquid crystal comprising of 25.6@xmath18 potassium laurate , 6.24@xmath18 decanol and 68.16@xmath18 deuterated water ( d@xmath19o ) @xcite .",
    "the system exhibits oriented nematic laminar phase at 300k @xcite .",
    "the deuterium signal splits into a doublet of 240 hz separation due to partially averaged quadrupolar interaction ( fig.1(a ) ) .",
    "all experiments were performed at a magnetic field of 11.7 telsa at which the resonance frequency of deuterium is 76.75 mhz .",
    "we have utilized this qutrit system for creation of pseudopure states and implementation of several one - to - one reversible operations .",
    "in a pure state each member of an ensemble can be described by the same vector @xcite . in equilibrium at a finite temperature and magnetic field",
    ", the ensemble of nuclear spins will be in a mixed state whose density matrix is of the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an identity matrix , c is a constant whose value is approximately @xmath22 for nuclear spins at room temperature and @xmath23 is the traceless deviation density matrix . though the identity matrix does not evolve under radio frequency pulses and system hamiltonian , the deviation part does evolve and emits the entire signal . in equilibrium",
    "both @xmath24 and @xmath23 are in mixed state . while it is requires extreme conditions of a very low temperature to create a pure @xmath24 , the deviation density matrix can be easily transformed , such that it behaves like a pure state . by using r.f .",
    "pulses and magnetic field gradients , the populations of all the levels except one can be equalized , in which case it behaves like a pure state .",
    "the state of the system when its deviation matrix corresponds to a pure state , is known as a pseudopure state @xcite .",
    "pseudopure states ( pps ) have been proposed and implemented in qubit systems using several experimental schemes by nmr @xcite . here",
    "we create the various pseudopure states in a single - qutrit system , by spatial averaging technique using transition selective pulses @xcite .",
    "transition selective pulses are long duration , low power r.f pulses applied at the resonant frequency between two energy levels connected by @xmath25m=@xmath261 , where m is the spin magnetic quantum number .",
    "such a pulse excites the single quantum transition between those levels and has been used earlier for quantum information processing in qubit systems@xcite .",
    "we have used these selective pulses for quantum information processing in qutrit systems . a selective @xmath27 pulse tuned at the resonant frequency between two energy levels interchanges the populations between them @xcite . similarly a selective @xmath28 pulse between two energy levels equilibrate",
    "the populations between the two levels and creates coherences which can be subsequently destroyed by a gradient pulse @xcite . starting from thermal equilibrium populations of fig 1(a ) ,",
    "a @xmath28 pulse applied on the transition @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) followed by a gradient to equalize the populations of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , created @xmath3 pseudopure state ( fig 1(b ) ) .",
    "@xmath4 pps is created by a @xmath30 followed by a gradient pulse to equalize the populations of @xmath4 and @xmath5 and then a @xmath31 pulse to interchange the populations between @xmath4 and @xmath3 ( fig 1(c ) ) .",
    "finally another gradient with different strength of the earlier was applied to destroy all coherences created by the imperfection of pulses .",
    "the @xmath32 pps was prepared by a @xmath33 pulse followed by a gradient .",
    "the created pseudopure states were detected using a final non - selective small - angle ( 5@xmath34 ) pulse for all the experiments .",
    "this small - angle pulse , in linear approximation , converts the population differences into single quantum transitions whose intensities are proportional to the population differences of the two involved levels only .",
    "the experimental spectra given in fig . 1 confirm the preparation of the various pseudopure states , in this qutrit system .",
    "there are six possible one - to - one reversible operations in a single qutrit system .",
    "these operations corresponds to six u(3 ) operations .",
    "starting from equilibrium we implement all these six unitary operations . the input , the output and the operators corresponding to the different operations are listed in table 1 along with the pulses required to implement them .",
    "the pulses described in third column of table 1 are to be applied from left to right .",
    "each one of the @xmath35 pulses correspond to a su(2 ) operation , since it operates on any two of the three states .",
    "u1 corresponds to identity operation and requires no pulses .",
    "u2 exchanges the states of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and is implemented by a @xmath36 pulse . as predicted earlier , the u(3 ) operations in a single qutrit can be split into series of su(2 ) operations @xcite .",
    "hence we note that while u2 and u3 are implemented with one su(2 ) operation , u5 and u6 required a series of two su(2 ) operations . u5 and",
    "u6 were implemented by @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively .",
    "while it is evident that the u4 operation can be performed by three su(2 ) operations in the series @xmath39 or @xmath40 , the same can also be performed by a non - selective @xmath27-pulse .",
    "we have implemented the later for the ease of the experiment .    these single - qutrit unitary operations will be useful for quantum information in qutrits .",
    "specially the last three operations of u4-u6 are applied in quantum computation @xcite , quantum games @xcite and quantum communication @xcite .",
    "u4 is used as not operation in unary algebra @xcite , while u5 and u6 are used as rotate - up and rotate - down operations in unary algebra @xcite . both for preparation of pseudopure states and implementation of unitary operations , gaussian shaped pulses with a duration of 6ms were used as selective pulses .",
    "after each selective pulse a sine - bell shaped gradient pulse was applied to destroy any coherences created by imperfection of pulses . since we start from thermal equilibrium , the result after each unitary operation is encoded in the output populations of the different states .",
    "the output populations were measured by using a non - selective flip - angle ( 5@xmath34 ) pulse . the experimental spectrum after implementation of each operation",
    "is given in fig.2 .",
    "the observed intensities are within 5@xmath18 of the expected intensities .",
    "here we have demonstrated creation of pseudopure states and implementation of unitary operations in a single qutrit system using a deuterium nuclei oriented in liquid crystalline matrix .",
    "this implementation extends the range of systems useful for quantum information processing by nmr .",
    "these systems can now be coupled with other nuclei to yield larger systems for quantum information processing .",
    "efforts are ongoing to create such systems and implement quantum computation and information processing in them .",
