    "the diffuse ultraviolet background is one of the key ingredients in the recipe leading to galaxy formation ( miralda - escud & ostriker 1990 ; giroux & shapiro 1996 ) .",
    "the intensity of the diffuse ultraviolet background has been estimated at moderate and high redshifts using the proximity effect on qso absorbers ( liske & williger 2001 ; scott _ et al . _  2001",
    "; fernndez - soto _",
    "et al . _  1995",
    "; kulkarni & fall 1993 ) , and results obtained so far suggest that it is too large to be explained by qsos alone ( madau & shull 1996 , but see also e.g. giallongo _ et al . _",
    "although systematic errors may make these measurements uncertain ( loeb & eisenstein 1995 , pascarelle _ et al . _",
    "2001 ) , several suggestions have been put forward to explain the observed extra intensity .",
    "one of the most popular suggestions calls for the escape of a large fraction of ionising photons from high - redshift galaxies .",
    "if correct , this would imply that the interstellar media of high - redshift galaxies must be at least partially transparent to ionising photons .",
    "but the best measurements available at low and moderate redshifts show that galaxies are ( at least nearly ) opaque to ionising photons .",
    "the large column densities of neutral hydrogen that surround most galaxies should be enough , depending on how they are distributed , to very effectively quench any outgoing flux of ionising photons .",
    "in fact , leitherer _ et al . _  ( 1995 ) find , in a sample of four starburst galaxies at an average redshift @xmath4 , that the limits to the escape fraction of lyman limit photons range from @xmath5 to @xmath6 ( with an observed flux ratio at 900   and 1500   of @xmath7 ) .",
    "et al . _  ( 1997 ) analyse the same data and obtain slightly less stringent limits , ranging from @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "et al . _  ( 2001 ) find a more stringent limit @xmath10 for a starburst galaxy of redshift @xmath11 . at higher redshifts ( @xmath12 ) , ferguson ( 2001 ) finds similar upper limits @xmath13 to the escape fraction .",
    "it is much less clear whether galaxies at still higher redshifts are as opaque to ionising photons as galaxies at low and moderate redshifts .",
    "accurate measurements become progressively more difficult at higher redshifts , because galaxies are much fainter and the presence of lyman @xmath14 forest absorption introduces further uncertainties .",
    "the only two measurements available so far are from steidel , pettini & adelberger ( 2001 ) and giallongo _ et al . _  ( 2002 ) . adopting a correction factor for intervening lyman @xmath14 absorption determined from a composite qso spectrum , steidel _ et al .",
    "_  reported @xmath15 using 29 galaxies at @xmath16 , while giallongo _",
    "et al . _  reported a @xmath17 upper limit @xmath18 using two galaxies at @xmath19 .",
    "the former measurement indicates that galaxies at @xmath19 are much more transparant to ionising photons , contributing an equal amount of ionising flux to the ultraviolet background radiation as the qsos .",
    "the latter measurement indicates otherwise .    in this article , we present a new measurement of @xmath20 using 27 galaxies at redshifts @xmath21 in the hubble deep field ( hdf ) .",
    "all of these galaxies have secure spectroscopic redshifts ( see cohen _ et al._2000c00and dawson _",
    "et al . _",
    "2001d01 ) and accurate broad - band photometry from hst / wfpc2 observations in the f300w , f450w , f606w , and f814w bandpasses .",
    "our measurement is based on deep space - based images , which provides two important advantages over the methods used by previous groups : first , our sky subtraction is more accurate , because two - dimensional sky subtraction in faint - galaxy images is more robust than one - dimensional sky subtraction in faint - galaxy spectra .",
    "second , the wavelength interval below the rest - frame lyman limit over which we integrate is larger , because the space - based broad - band images are sensitive to observed - frame wavelengths as short as @xmath22  , allowing us to integrate over rest - frame wavelength intervals as large as @xmath23   in some cases .",
    "our method also improves upon previous work by accounting for the effect of the lyman @xmath14 forest absorption by performing a large numer of random realizations of a parameterized distribution , to account for variations of the absorbing clouds across different lines of sight .",
    "our results show that the escape fraction estimated from the ensemble of 27 galaxies has a ( statistical ) @xmath1 upper limit of @xmath24 . given that our galaxy sample spans a range of properties in redshift , intrinsic colours , and luminosities , we also explore possible systematic effects by dividing the galaxies into different subsamples .",
    "we do not find any evidence to support that bluer galaxies have higher escape fractions of ionizing photons .",
    "instead , we find that more luminous galaxies appear to have shallower ultraviolet spectral slopes and higher escape fractions ( at the 2@xmath25 level of significance ) .",
    "we do also search for other possible systematic effects that could be inherent to our method , and find that other effects can not in any realistic way account for a large increase in the escape fraction .",
    "we consider all galaxies in the hdf with known spectroscopic redshifts in the range @xmath21 .",
    "the lower limit is chosen so that the rest - frame lyman limit begins to affect the photometry in the f300w bandpass .",
    "the upper limit is chosen so that we can still reasonably distinguish absorption due to the lyman @xmath14 forest from the intrinsic lyman limit absorption .",
    "we previously measured high - quality photometry of these galaxies using hst / wfpc2 through the f300w , f450w , f606w , and f814w filters ( fernndez - soto , lanzetta & yahil 1999fly99 hereafter ; lanzetta _ et al . _  in preparation ) .",

    ", our method proceeds in several steps as follows :    first , we determine a fiducial spectral energy distribution of each galaxy by fitting model spectral energy distributions to the broad - band photometric measurements that fall between rest - frame wavelengths @xmath34 and 2800  .",
    "the wavelength range is chosen to avoid the spectral discontinuity produced by the lyman series ( rest - frame wavelength @xmath35  ) and the balmer break ( rest - frame wavelengths @xmath36 3000  ) .",
    "the fiducial spectral energy distributions are based on the six spectrophotometric templates ( of e , sbc , scd , irr , sb1 , and sb2 galaxies ) of our previous photometric redshift measurements ( yahata _ et al . _  2000",
    "; see also bentez 2000 ) together with a power - law form @xmath37 .",
    "( the power - law form is required because a few of the galaxies are found to be bluer  in the ultraviolet rest - frame  than any of the starburst spectrophotometric templates . in each of these cases , @xmath38 . )",
    "the spectral energy distributions are selected according to a @xmath39 analysis similar to the analysis used for our previous photometric redshift measurements ( lanzetta _ et al . _  1996",
    "; fly99 ) .",
    "next , we modify the fiducial spectral energy distribution of each galaxy by adding the effect of intrinsic lyman - limit absorption , which is characterized by an assumed lyman - limit optical depth @xmath40 that is taken to be universal across all galaxies . for a lyman - limit optical depth @xmath40 ,",

    "next , we modify the fiducial spectral energy distribution of each galaxy by adding the effect of random realizations of intervening lyman series and lyman limit absorption . here",
    "we characterize the distribution of lyman @xmath14 forest absorption systems by a distribution function @xmath47 , which is defined in such a way that @xmath48 is the expected number of absorption systems in the neutral hydrogen column density interval @xmath49 around @xmath50 , doppler parameter interval @xmath51 around @xmath52 , and redshift interval @xmath53 around @xmath54 .",

    "we have extensively checked that simulated spectra generated according to these parameters reproduce to within observed scatter the average lyman @xmath14 absorption @xmath65 and average lyman series absorption @xmath66 . in figure 1",
    "we show the average values of @xmath65 and @xmath66 , compared to values found in the literature .",
    "the agreement is perfect within the scatter present in the observational data .",
    "the incidence of lyman limit systems ( those with hydrogen opacity @xmath67 ) is an important factor in our simulation , as they are amongst the main drivers of the absorption bluewards of the galactic lyman edge .",
    "we plot in figure 2 the density of lyman limit systems generated by our lyman @xmath14 forest model , and compare it with the numbers measured by different authors ( as described in the figure ) .",
    "as can be seen , our model produces slightly less lyman limit systems at the lowest redshifts than have been observed .",
    "whereas this effect could produce a bias favouring lower escape fraction values , we have checked that this effect is not important ( see 4.2 and 4.3 for details ) .",
    "this slight deffect is the result of our decission to adopt a single parameterization to generate all of the lyman @xmath14 forest  a change in the normalisation to improve the aspect of figure 2 would conflict with the data shown in figure 1 .",
    "globally , we consider that our model reproduces within reasonable limits the properties of the intergalactic medium .",
    "next , we measure the simulated spectrum of each galaxy  constructed from the fiducial spectral energy distribution of each galaxy modified by the effects of intrinsic lyman - limit absorption with an assumed lyman - limit optical depth @xmath40 and of random realizations of intervening lyman series and lyman limit absorption  at short - wavelengths , i.e.  over the f300w bandpass which is sensitive at wavelengths below the rest - frame lyman limit , and we compare observed energy fluxes @xmath68 and uncertainties @xmath69 and simulated energy fluxes @xmath70 of the @xmath71th galaxy in the @xmath72th simulation . to randomize the effects of intervening lyman series and lyman limit absorption , we repeat this procedure a large number of times , and we form the likelihood as a function of lyman - limit optical depth @xmath40 as @xmath73 } { \\sqrt { 2 \\pi { \\sigma_{\\rm obs}^{(i)}}^2 } } \\right),\\ ] ] where the product extends over the @xmath74 galaxies of the sample and where the sum extends over the @xmath75 simulations of the analysis .",

    "it is obvious from inspection of figure 3 that in many cases ( especially at the lowest redshifts ) the fluxes observed through the f300w filter are less than the fluxes expected , if the galaxies were completely transparent to ionising photons .",
    "this trend is also present in the other galaxies of the sample .",
    "our quantitative maximum - likelihood analysis of this trend across the entire sample of galaxies establishes a lower limit to the optical depth at the lyman limit or an upper limit to the escape fraction for these galaxies . in this section",

    "these authors observed in the average spectrum of 29 galaxies a flux ratio @xmath84 . after correcting for the effects of the lyman @xmath14 forest absorption using a composite qso spectrum at the same redshift",
    ", they found an intrinsic flux ratio of @xmath15where the effects of intrinsic galactic absorption and attenuation by dust or gas have not been eliminated .",
    "the authors further incorporated to this measurement a plausible estimate of the flux discontinuity at the lyman limit due to absorption in stellar atmospheres to derive an escape fraction @xmath85 . which is different from the usual one",
    " they normalised the escape fraction at 900   to the escape fraction at 1500  .",

    "steidel and collaborators suggested that the high escape fraction found in their work might result from some selection bias of their galaxy sample .",
    "the galaxies incorporated into their analysis include only 29 of 875 galaxies for which they obtained spectroscopic observations with the keck telescope , selected on the basis of quality of the observations at blue wavelengths .",
    "this selection condition quite naturally selects galaxies that are either very blue , very luminous , or both .",
    "qsos are known to be transparent to ionizing photons at ultraviolet wavelengths ( zheng _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) , so it is not unreasonable to speculate that very blue or very luminous ( or both ) galaxies might exhibit larger escape fractions than avarage galaxies . to examine this possibilty , we repeated the analysis described in   3 for various subsamples of the galaxy sample .",

    "to some extent , this statistically insignificant difference could be due to the already mentioned relative lack of lyman limit systems in our model at low redshift .",
    "given that the results from the high - redshift sample ( where our model reproduces exactly the observed number of lyman limit systems ) are not significatively different from the results obtained using the low redshift sample , we infer that the difference in the model does not induce a large change .",

    "it is very likely that the method we are using to analyse the data may introduce errors of a systematic nature , that could potentially be of the same order of the statistical ones .",
    "we have performed some checks in order to estimate which could be the contribution from several sources of uncertainty .      as was shown in  3 above",
    ", our lyman @xmath14 forest model has been checked against the observed properties , and agrees with them within observational limits . in order to estimate the uncertainty in @xmath20 that could originate from the uncertainties in the model",
    ", we have performed new measurements of @xmath20 using forest models that differ from our `` standard '' one by applying a 10% increase / decrease in the normalisation of the line density .",
    "we must remark that this 10% change does largely overestimate the possible uncertainties in our model ",
    "the models with 10% more or less lines represent bad fits to the observed forest properties .",
    "as expected , an increase in the forest density implies an increase in the measured value of the escape fraction : more of the uv photons can escape each galaxy while keeping the observed photometric properties , as their mean free path is reduced by the increased density of absorbers .",
    "_ mutatis mutandis _",
    ", when the forest density is reduced , the value of @xmath20 moves down .",
    "the change is , however , small : at the @xmath1 confidence level , the original limit ( @xmath93 ) becomes @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) when the line density is decreased ( increased ) by 10% .",
    "another potential problem in our forest model could be the lack of clustering in our simulations , as opposed to what is shown by the observations .",
    "our measurement is not affected by the small - scale clustering that has been observed in the lyman @xmath14 forest lines ( fernndez - soto _ et al . _",
    "1996 ) because we are integrating over much larger scales . of potential importance is the observed clustering of high - column density absorbers ( sargent , boksenberg & steidel 1988 ) .",
    "it is difficult to quantify its effect , but we expect it should be dilluted by the size of our sample , and estimate that it produces a smaller variance than the one induced by the @xmath9610% change in the number of lines presented above",
    ".      in the case of some of the galaxies , the photometric data available could allow for the assignation of two different fiducial spectral templates with similar goodness - of - fit values .",
    "the choice of one of them over the other ( which we perform algorithmically via the minimum chi - squared criterium ) could produce an extra uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath20 .",
    "the same effect can be produced if our selection of templates is not dense enough to cover the possible uv shapes , or if the photometric uncertainties are too big .",
    "we have evaluated the uncertainty induced by this effect by performing the following exercise : we have forced all spectral templates to be one step bluer ( always along the sequence formed by ell , sbc , scd , irr , sb2 , sb1 ) than the one which is the best - fit choice , and repeated the analysis .",
    "this does in fact result in very bad fits for many of the galaxies , and must thus be considered _ a very large overestimate _ of the possible uncertainties . under this scenario , with the galaxies emitting far more ionising photons",
    "than what is indicated by their actual uv continua , the escape fraction diminishes to very low values : @xmath97 at the @xmath1 level .",
    "we have also performed the opposite exercise , forcing all galaxies to be one step redder than their best - fit template . under this assumption",
    "the galaxies emit far less ionising photons than what their uv continua actually suggests , and this results in an increase in the acceptable escape fraction , which reaches @xmath98 , with a @xmath1 upper limit @xmath99 .",
    "as we explained before , these limits must be taken as _ very large overestimates _ of the possible systematic effects induced by our spectroscopic templates , as we do not realistically expect to mistake all galaxies in the same direction . however , even under this extreme assumption , and incorporating also the effects described in  4.3.1 , the upper limit to the measured escape fraction is still far below the values measured by steidel _",
    "_  ( 2002 ) .",
    "we have presented a new method to measure the escape fraction of ionising photons from galaxies at @xmath82 .",
    "our method provides a cleaner measurement compared to the classical spectroscopic technique because the problem of the sky subtraction is reduced almost to insignificance and we can use a wider bandpass .",
    "the value we obtain ( @xmath100 , with @xmath93 at a @xmath1 confidence level ) is in agreement with most previous measurements of the escape fraction of ionising photons at high and low redshift , being more stringent than most previous upper limits .",
    "it is largely in contradiction with the value presented by steidel _",
    "et al . _  ( 2001 ) for high - redshift galaxies .",
    "we have studied possible selection effects that could cause this apparent difference and conclude that , _ within the limits set by the size of our sample _ , they can not explain the large discordance between our results .",
    "neither can the difference be explained by possible systematic effects induced by our method , as we also have shown",
    ". a ( very conservative ) estimate of the confidence limits when all systematic effects are included leads to a @xmath1 upper limit to the escape fraction that can not be higher than @xmath101 .",
    "if the escape fraction of ionising photons reported here represents the general situation at high redshift , then normal galaxies can not be responsible for any significant fraction of the high - redshift ionising background .",
    "on the other hand , if the proximity effect measurements of the background flux are confirmed , then the problem persists to find the objects responsible for the ionisation state of the high - redshift universe .",
    "deep , narrow - band imaging of local and high - redshift galaxies at wavelengths slightly above and below their intrinsic lyman limits could settle this argument .",

    "<S> we investigate the intrinsic opacity of high - redshift galaxies to outgoing ionising photons using high - quality photometry of a sample of 27 spectroscopically - identified galaxies of redshift @xmath0 in the hubble deep field . </S>",
    "<S> our measurement is based on maximum - likelihood fitting of model galaxy spectral energy distributions  including the effects of intrinsic lyman - limit absorption and random realizations of intervening lyman - series and lyman - limit absorption  to photometry of galaxies from space- and ground - based broad - band images . </S>",
    "<S> our method provides several important advantages over the methods used by previous groups , including most importantly that two - dimensional sky subtraction of faint - galaxy images is more robust than one - dimensional sky subtraction of faint - galaxy spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we find at the @xmath1 _ statistical _ confidence level that _ on average _ no more than 4% of the ionising photons escape galaxies of redshift @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this result is consistent with observations of low- and moderate - redshift galaxies but is in direct contradiction to a recent result based on medium - resolution spectroscopy of high - redshift ( @xmath2 ) galaxies . dividing our sample in subsamples according to luminosity , intrinsic ultraviolet colour , and redshift , we find no evidence for selection effects that could explain such discrepancy . </S>",
    "<S> even when all systematic effects are included , the data could not realistically accomodate any escape fraction value larger than @xmath3 15% .    </S>",
