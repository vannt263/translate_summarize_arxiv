    "a former president of the german research foundation declared in 1989 : `` when i came to gttingen in 1931 , everyone there knew who were the great scientists among the professors [ ... ] and the best young scientists , those with a great future . [ ... ] i still find no fault in this system [ of evaluation ] .",
    "but i know that today it can no longer work effectively",
    "... it is an informal system which requires unselfishness and self - criticism on the part of its main participants .",
    "this renders it defenseless _ against suspicion _",
    " one can not say : `` i am honest so you must believe me '' '' ( my emphasis )  @xcite .",
    "leibnitz nicely summarizes the permanent tension between an expert  partially subjective  way of evaluating research and a more objective way , based on ( bibliometric ) quantitative indicators .",
    "this tension has known renewed interest lately thanks to the introduction of a promising bibliometric indicator , @xmath0 , called the hirsch index after physicist j. hirsch who introduced it in 2005  @xcite .",
    "the h index is defined as the highest number of papers of a scientist that received h or more citations each , while the other papers have not more than h citations each .",
    "he suggests that his index reduces several well - known problems of other indices such as the number of articles or the number of citations .",
    "hirsch also introduced the normalized index @xmath1 .",
    "it represents @xmath0 divided by the `` scientific age '' , i.e. the career length of the scientist , which by convention starts the year of his first publication .",
    "this normalization takes into account the fact that @xmath0 automatically increases with time , and implicitly assumes that @xmath0 increases linearly in time , an assumption which is not supported by our data ( section  [ age ] ) .    in this paper ,",
    "we present a method to extract bibliometric indicators for several thousand scientists .",
    "this allows us to study average trends of academic productivity from most scientific domains .",
    "our large dataset also allows us to test empirically two fundamental questions for bibliometry : is @xmath0 better than the other quantifiers of academic activity in predicting promotions of cnrs researchers to senior positions ?",
    "second : if @xmath0 is the best predictor , is it actually good ? by this we mean : what is the proportion of promotions that are predicted by @xmath0 ?",
    "our study significantly improves preceding empirical studies carried out on small samples for technical reasons ( difficulty of obtaining large sets of robust bibliometric indicators ) .",
    "moreover , these studies were generally limited to a subdiscipline : physics  @xcite , biomedicine  @xcite , information science  @xcite , business  @xcite and chemistry  @xcite .    on a more general note",
    ", our paper wants to contribute empirically to the old discussion of the relevance of bibliometric indicators to account for scientific merits . to be schematic ,",
    "there are two opposing positions .",
    "first , science experts argue that the only way to judge scientists works and merits , in order to hire or promote them , is through subjective expertise by insiders .",
    "second , some argue that these experts can not be trusted and promote an `` objective '' science evaluation through the use of well - defined , quantitative operations . before entering the empirical part of our paper , we think that it important to put this debate into context .",
    "there is a general tendency in modern society to quantify aspects of life , to be able to grasp them more easily .",
    "this has been summarized long ago in a. n. whitehead s famous quote : `` civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them .",
    "operations of thought are like cavalry charges in a battle  they are strictly limited in number , they require fresh horses , and must only be made at decisive moments''@xcite . besides scientists top 100  @xcite , examples of this tendency include sports players ( baseball , basketball ... ) or chief executive officers according to their fortune .",
    "summarizing complex systems by homogeneous quantities allows a simpler ( but controversial ) mathematical treatment of complex questions , as when economists transform pollution or time gains into money . as sociologist bruno latour points out : `` the universal yardstick of fortune  money  simplifies extremely complex social relations . to account for rank hierarchies between swann and madame verdurin",
    ", one needs all the subtlety of marcel proust . instead , to rank contemporary millionaires ,",
    "a fortune journalist will do''@xcite .",
    "it is tempting to interpret this trend towards quantification as a linear progress towards more powerful and more objective scientific methods .",
    "however , this view forgets that quantification is intimately related to expertise , and that expertise is a relation between scientific experts and public officials  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to understand quantification , it is important to look at the social basis of authority of the experts .    in our modern society ,",
    "expertise based on mere intuition and judgement seems obscure and potentially undemocratic .",
    "this is because for non experts , a valid judgement and a subjective bias are difficult to distinguish .",
    "therefore , one solution is to ban subjectivity altogether , even if this leads to throw away ( part of ) the baby with the bath water : mechanical objectivity , i.e. knowledge based on explicit rules , necessary for quantification , is never fully attainable . as porter argues , `` the appeal of numbers is especially compelling to bureaucratic officials who lack the mandate of a popular election .",
    "quantification is a way of making decisions without seeming to decide .",
    "objectivity lends authority to officials who have very little of their own ''  @xcite .",
    "when working on bibliometric indicators , one should keep in mind the diffuse background of mistrust in peer evaluation of research .",
    "for example , hirsch s original paper  @xcite concludes by : `` i suggest that this index may provide a useful yardstick to compare different individuals competing for the same resource when an important evaluation criterion is scientific achievement , _ in an unbiased way _ '' ( my emphasis ) .",
    "this resonates with the ambition of science administrators to find a single indicator to select and/or promote scientists , without having to rely on more or less uncontrollable commissions .",
    "this tension has been going on for years in france , where peer evaluation commissions defend their expertise against various attempts from cnrs administration to implement `` objective '' promotions based on bibliometric indicators .",
    "but this tension is of course more general than its cnrs version , as exemplified by the discussions around the shanghai ranking of universities ( see a short presentation of the obvious shortcomings of such a ranking in  @xcite ) .",
    "here are some of the arguments offered by the defenders of the `` expert subjective judgement '' . in hard or social sciences ,",
    "any quantifier supposes a theory that gives meaning to it . and , clearly , citation theory is not one of the strongest !",
    "if a significant fraction of citations received by a paper acknowledges its importance for the community , there exist many other well - established reasons to cite a work .",
    "for example , mathew s effect ( the more cited get more citations ) or the fact that one can cite a paper to criticize it .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for one of the rare empirical studies of citers motivations and  @xcite for reviews .",
    "scientists know many ways to improve their citation record , and will develop many more if this indicator becomes crucial for their career .",
    "for example , a team can decide to include all its members in all publications ( since nor the citation record nor @xmath0 takes into account the number of authors of a paper ) and refer to their own publications extensively .",
    "they might even focus their citations on those papers which are a few citations short of counting for their @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , it is unfair to suggest , as hirsch does  @xcite , that only peer committees can be biased .",
    "bibliometric indicators are also biased , although in different and , arguably , more systematic ways .",
    "it is surprising that bibliometric indicators can be uncritically taken as giving the `` true '' value of scientific merits , transforming in `` errors '' any deviation of peer judgment from the @xmath0 ranking : `` even though the @xmath0 indices of approved [ ... ] applicants on average ( arithmetic mean and median ) are higher than those of rejected applicants ( and with this , fundamentally confirm the validity of the funding decisions ) , the distributions of the @xmath0 indices show in part overlaps that we categorized as type i error ( falsely drawn approval ) or type ii error ( falsely drawn rejection ) ''  @xcite .",
    "needless to say , even if bibliometric indicators could account for academic achievement , they ignore many dimensions of scientists work which should be taken into account for a proper evaluation : conceptual innovation capacity , risk taking , industrial collaborations , teaching abilities , popularization activities , team management , etc .",
    "briefly stated , our method uses the `` author search '' of the web of science ( wos )  @xcite on the subset of 8750 scientists having filled out the cnrs report the last three years .",
    "we exclude researchers in social sciences ( their bibliographic record is not well documented in the wos ) and in high energy physics ( too few records in the cnrs database ) , leading to 6900 names . after filtering records suspected to be erroneous ,",
    "we obtain a database of 3659 scientists with reliable bibliometric indicators , as checked by close inspection of several hundred records .",
    "a summary of the subdisciplines encompassed by our database , together with some characteristic average values , is shown in table  [ section ] .",
    "the different positions of cnrs scientists are , by increasing hierarchical importance : `` charg de recherche 2@xmath2 classe '' ( cr2 ) , `` charg de recherche 1@xmath3 classe '' ( cr1 ) , `` directeur de recherche 2@xmath2 classe '' ( dr2 ) , `` directeur de recherche 1@xmath3 classe '' ( dr1 ) and `` directeur de recherche de classe exceptionnelle '' ( drce ) .",
    ".overview of the cnrs subdisciplines . [ cols=\"^,<,>,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ dr1fit ]",
    "thanks to a new filtering method , we have obtained a large database of scientists bibliometric records .",
    "we have been able to determine the average trends of bibliometric indicators as a function of scientists ages , positions and disciplines .",
    "our main result is that generation effects seem negligible , since the mean publication rate or the mean number of citations per paper do not vary significantly with scientists ages .",
    "however , the average normalized hirsch index @xmath1 does decrease with age , a trend that seems related to the very definition of @xmath1 and not to a decrease of scientific activity .    our large database has also allowed us to study the relative relevance of bibliometric indicators to predict promotions to senior positions .",
    "we find that , overall , @xmath0 shows the best performance , while the number of papers is second and accounts better for promotions of scientists from the engineering department and for promotions to the highest cnrs positions ( `` directeur de recherche 1@xmath3 classe '' ) .",
    "incidentally , the good prediction of promotions by the bibliometric indicators confirms that our large database of bibliometric records is robust .    to conclude , let us come back to our inital controversy on  mechanical objectivity ",
    ", i.e. the idea of deciding promotions automatically , on the basis of bibliometric indicators .",
    "our study shows that the consequences would be dramatic , changing roughly half the promotions every year .",
    "the same order of magnitude for the difference between @xmath0 and peer committees rankings can be guessed from ref .",
    "further studies are needed to understand the differences of the two rankings , which may be surprising since @xmath0 is already used to evaluate scientists in many cnrs subdisciplines .",
    "one could argue that promotion is also determined by scientists activities which are not taken into account in the bibliometric indicators ( see above , [ cnrs ] ) .",
    "however , in a forthcoming paper  @xcite , we show that dissemination activities ( industrial collaborations , popularization and teaching ) are practically irrelevant for peer committees decisions about promotions .",
    "the differences could then be explained by the consideration of additional activities ( team management , risk taking  ) , by unsatisfactory peer evaluation ( preferential promotion of friends , visible colleagues  ) or by the opposite : human expertise capable to judge whether automatic measures are really meaningful .",
    "automatic ranking appears as a clear political choice , selecting some of the scientists activities and distrusting peer committes .",
    "we acknowledge illuminating discussions with y. langevin and s. bauin from cnrs , j. lemarec from ecole normale suprieure - lettres et sciences humaines and p. kreimer from universidad de quilmes ( argentina ) .",
