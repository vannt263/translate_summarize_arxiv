    "deligne and mumford @xcite showed that any curve with normal crossing singularities deforms to a smooth curve .",
    "this is no longer true for higher dimensional spaces .",
    "friedman @xcite discovered that an obstruction for the existence of smoothings with regular total space is an invertible sheaf on the singular locus .",
    "he calls spaces with normal crossing singularities _ d - semistable _ if this sheaf is trivial . so d - semistability is a necessary condition for the existence of smoothings with regular total space .",
    "this condition , however , is far from being sufficient .",
    "nowadays , the notion of d - semistability is best understood via _ log structures _ and _ log spaces_. these concepts are due to fontaine and illusie , and were largely explored by k.  kato @xcite .",
    "they now play an important role in crystalline cohomology and deformation theory , and have applications to hodge theory , tale cohomology , fundamental groups , and mirror symmetry .",
    "let @xmath0 be an algebraic space .",
    "a log space @xmath1 with underlying algebraic space @xmath0 is a sheaf of monoids @xmath2 on @xmath0 related to the structure sheaf @xmath3 by certain axioms ( for details see section [ spaces and structures ] ) .",
    "it turns out that a space with normal crossing singularities @xmath0 locally supports local log structures that are unique up to isomorphism , and d - semistability is equivalent with the existence of a global log structure , together with the triviality of the normal sheaf .",
    "this has been exploited by kawamata and namikawa @xcite for the construction of calabi  yau manifolds , and by steenbrink @xcite for the construction of mixed hodge structures .",
    "the corresponding theoretical framework is due to kato @xcite .",
    "the first goal of this paper is to generalize the notion of d - semistability to spaces that are locally isomorphic to boundary divisors in toric varieties , which one might call _ toroidal crossings_. the theory of log structures suggests that such generalization is possible , because spaces with normal crossing singularities are just special instances of log smooth morphisms .",
    "furthermore , it became clear in various areas that spaces with normal crossing singularities do not account for all degenerations that one wants to study .",
    "compare , for example , the work of kollr and shepherd ",
    "barron @xcite on degenerate surfaces , and of alexeev @xcite on degenerate abelian varieties .",
    "our main idea is to use the theory of _ nonabelian cohomology _ , in particular the notion of _ gerbe _ , to define d - semistability . roughly speaking",
    ", we define a _ log atlas _",
    "@xmath4 on @xmath0 to be a gerbe of local log structures , that is , a collection of locally isomorphic log structures on certain neighborhoods . now d - semistability is nothing but the triviality of the gerbe class @xmath5 $ ] in a suitable @xmath6-group , plus the triviality of the normal bundle .",
    "it turns out that the coefficient sheaf of the @xmath6-cohomology , which is the _ band _ in the terminology of nonabelian cohomology , becomes abelian if we fix as additional datum the sheaf of monoids @xmath7 .",
    "then the coefficient sheaf becomes the abelian sheaf @xmath8 , and this allows us to calculate @xmath9 via certain exact sequences . using such exact sequences , we deduce criteria for the existence of global log structures .",
    "the theory works best if we make two additional assumptions : the toric varieties that are local models should be gorenstein and regular in codimension two .",
    "our main result is : each log atlas @xmath4 determines an invertible sheaf on @xmath10 called the _ restricted conormal sheaf _ , and its extendibility to @xmath0 is equivalent to the existence of a global log structure , and its triviality is equivalent to d - semistability .",
    "olsson independently obtained similar results in the case of normal crossing varieties @xcite .",
    "he also showed that moduli of log structures yield algebraic stacks @xcite .",
    "the second goal of this paper is to apply toroidal crossings to mirror symmetry .",
    "our starting point is the observation that from @xmath11 it is possible to construct another degenerate variety @xmath12 , by gluing together the projective toric varieties @xmath13 $ ] for @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath1 itself consists of projective toric varieties glued to each other along toric subvarieties , then there is a monoid sheaf on @xmath12 that at least locally is the sheaf @xmath15 of a toroidal crossing log structure .",
    "this gives an involutive correspondence between certain degenerate varieties endowed with such sheaves of monoids .",
    "applied to hypersurfaces in projective toric varieties it reproduces a degenerate version of batyrev s mirror construction , but it applies to many more cases , for example degenerate abelian varieties .    of course , mirror symmetry should do much more than what the naive version presented here does .",
    "our approach indicates that one should try to understand mirror symmetry in terms of limiting data of degenerations of varieties with trivial canonical bundle . by _ limiting data",
    "_ we mean information about the degeneration supported on the central fiber : most importantly , the log structure induced by the embedding into the total space , and certain cohomology classes on the central fiber obtained by specialization .",
    "mirror symmetry then is a symmetry acting on such limiting data .",
    "the explanation of the mirror phenomenon would then be that it relates limiting data of different degenerations .",
    "mark gross and the second author worked out a correspondence of true log spaces that involves also data encoding the degeneration of a polarization , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we thank mark gross for valuable discussion about the mirror construction in the last three sections , and for finding a mistake in our first version of theorem [ canonical bijection ] .",
    "we also thank the referees for pointing out errors and suggesting improvements .",
    "most of the work on this paper has been done while the first author was a dfg research fellow at m.i.t . , and",
    "the second author was visiting the mathematical department of jussieu as a dfg heisenberg fellow .",
