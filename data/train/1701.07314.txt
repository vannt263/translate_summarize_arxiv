    "coupled dynamical systems have been extensively studied over the last few decades as they provide us a framework for modelling many complex systems @xcite .",
    "the focus of investigations have mostly been on phenomena emerging under variation of the local dynamics of the units and the interactions among them .",
    "most studies have assumed the interactions among the nodes to be invariant over time .",
    "however in recent times there have been efforts to incorporate a time - varying links , namely changing connections between the units in a dynamical network @xcite .",
    "such time varying interactions model the evolution of connections over time , and are commonly found in physical , biological , social and engineered systems @xcite .",
    "studies so far have considered the variation in links as a function of time , while the form of coupling remains the same . here",
    "we will explore a new direction in time - varying interactions : we will study the _ effect of switched coupling forms _ on the emergent behaviour .",
    "we consider two coupling functions , one diffusive and the other conjugate coupling between the two oscillators .",
    "coupling via conjugate variables is natural in a variety of experimental situations where sub - systems are coupled by feeding the output of one into the other .",
    "an example from the recent literature is provided by the experiments of kim and roy on coupled semiconductor laser systems @xcite , where the photon intensity fluctuation from one laser is used to modulate the injection current of the other , and vice versa .",
    "hybrid coupling @xcite also has relevance in ecological models , where migration and cross - predation ( analogous to conjugate coupling ) @xcite occurs between two population patches , namely over some time migration or diffusive coupling may be dominant , while at other times cross - predation between the two patches is prevalent .",
    "the primary goal of this study is to demonstrate the non - trivial dynamical states arising out of the temporal interplay between two coupling forms .",
    "the test - bed of our inquiry will be a generic system of coupled oscillators , which we describe in detail below .",
    "a general form of coupled dynamical oscillators is given by : @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the set of @xmath2 dynamical variables of the @xmath3th oscillator .",
    "the matrix @xmath4 of dimension @xmath5 contains information on the coupling topology .",
    "@xmath6 is the coupling function that represents the nature of the interaction and the variables involved in the interaction term , with the superscript primes ( @xmath7 ) on @xmath8 denoting conjugate or `` dissimilar '' variables @xcite .",
    "now , complex systems often undergo hopf bifurcations and sufficiently close to such a bifurcation point , the variables which have slower time - scales can be eliminated .",
    "this leaves us with a couple of simple first order ordinary differential equations , popularly known as the stuart - landau system @xcite . in this work",
    "we will consider two diffusively coupled oscillators of this form , namely two coupled stuart - landau systems .    specifically ,",
    "when the coupling between the oscillators is through _ similar _ variables , the dynamical equations are given by : @xmath9 and when the oscillators are coupled to each other through _ dissimilar _ variables , the dynamical equations are given by :    @xmath10    with    @xmath11    coupled stuart - landau oscillators have been a good model for the study of oscillation death @xcite and amplitude death @xcite . when the coupling is through similar variables ( cf .",
    "[ eqn_similar ] ) , the oscillators get synchronized at a very low coupling strengths , and remain oscillatory and synchronized up to very high coupling strength . however when coupling is through dissimilar variables ( cf .",
    "[ eqn_dissimilar ] ) , the system shows oscillatory behaviour for small coupling strengths , and increasing coupling strengths give rise to amplitude death and subsequently oscillation death @xcite .",
    "now we consider a scenario where the form of the coupling between the oscillators is time dependent , namely , the form of coupling _ switches between the similar and dissimilar variables_. the switching of the coupling form may be periodic or probabilistic .      here",
    "the oscillators change their coupling form periodically .",
    "if the time period of the switch is @xmath12 , we consider the system to be coupled via similar variables for fraction @xmath13 of the cycle , followed by coupling to dissimilar variables for the remaining part .",
    "so when @xmath14 , the oscillators are always coupled to dissimilar variables and when @xmath15 the oscillators are coupled through similar variable for all time . for @xmath16 , the oscillators experience coupling through similar variables for time @xmath17 , followed by coupling through dissimilar variables for time @xmath18 , in each cycle of period @xmath12 .",
    "[ fig : bif_periodic_fixed_t ] shows the bifurcation diagram for a system of two coupled oscillators with periodically changing coupling form , with respect to coupling strength , for different @xmath13 . at @xmath19 ,",
    "i.e. for uncoupled stuart - landau oscillators , one naturally obtains period @xmath20 oscillations . increasing the coupling strength results in suppression of oscillations .",
    "interestingly though , the window of coupling strength over which oscillations are suppressed depends non - monotonically on @xmath13 . at first , as @xmath13 increases the fixed point window increases ( cf .",

    "the two colours represent symmetric solutions around the unstable fixed point , arising from different initial conditions . ]",
    "further , notice from fig .",
    "[ fig : bif_periodic_fixed_t]a - b that low - amplitude oscillations are restored at higher coupling strengths again , for intermediate @xmath13 . fig .",
    "[ fig : osc_amplitude_periodic ] shows the effect of the frequency of switching coupling forms upon the amplitude of the revived oscillations .",
    "increase in frequency of switching leads to the reduction of oscillation amplitude , and the results approach those arising from effective mean - field like dynamical equations ( cf .",
    "[ eqn_effective ] ) which will be presented in section v ( namely , fig .",

    "here @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and the coupling switches between similar and dissimilar variables periodically , with similar - variable coupling for time @xmath17 , followed by dissimilar - variable coupling for time @xmath24 , where @xmath35 is the frequency of switching . ]",
    "here the oscillators change their coupling form at intervals of time @xmath12 , with the coupling form chosen probabilistically .",
    "we consider the probability for the oscillators to be coupled via similar variables to be @xmath36 , and the probability of coupling mediated via dissimilar variables to be @xmath37 . for @xmath38 , at the time of switching , the similar - variable coupling form is chosen with probability @xmath36 and the dissimilar - variable form is chosen with probability @xmath37 .",
    "so larger @xmath36 favours coupling through similar variables and smaller @xmath36 favours dissimilar - variable coupling , with the oscillators always experiencing dissimilar - variable coupling for the limiting case of @xmath39 and similar - variable coupling for @xmath40 . here",

    "[ fig : bif_probabilistic_fixed_t ] shows the bifurcation diagram , with respect to coupling strength , for different @xmath36 .",
    "again it is evident that the window of coupling strength over which oscillations are suppressed , depends non - monotonically on @xmath36 , as it did under variation of @xmath13 for the case of periodically switched coupling forms ( cf .",
    "[ fig : fp_width_t_switch_0.02 ] ) .",

    "[ fig : bif_probabilistic_fixed_t]d , and the oscillations are no longer suppressed anywhere .",
    "this suggests that when the probability of coupling through similar variables and dissimilar variables is similar ( i.e. @xmath43 ) oscillations are suppressed to the greatest degree .     of one of the oscillators , with respect to coupling strength @xmath23 . here",
    "the coupling form probabilistically switches at time intervals of @xmath12 between similar and dissimilar variables , with the probability of similar - variable coupling being @xmath36 , and the probability of dissimilar - variable coupling being @xmath37 , for ( a ) @xmath41 , ( b ) @xmath44 , ( c ) @xmath42 and ( d ) @xmath45 ( with @xmath29 ) .",

    "namely , the largest window of fixed point dynamics arises where there is balance in the probability of occurrence of the coupling forms .",

    "the commonly employed linear stability analysis , based on the linearization in the neighbourhood of fixed points , provides only local information about the stability at the fixed point .",
    "it can not accurately indicate the stability for large perturbations , nor the basin of attraction of the dynamics , especially in the presence of other attractors in phase space .    here",
    "we calculate the basin stability of the dynamical states @xcite .",
    "this is a more robust and global estimate of stability , and effectively incorporates non - local and non - linear effects on the stability of fixed points .",
    "specifically , basin stability is calculated as follows : we choose a large number of random initial conditions , spread uniformly over a volume of phase space , and find what fraction of these are attracted to stable fixed points .",
    "figs  [ fig : bs_periodic_fixed_t_switch ] shows the basin stability of the fixed point state , in the parameter space of @xmath13 and coupling strengths , for different time periods of switching @xmath12 .",
    "clearly one obtains oscillation suppression in windows of coupling strength and @xmath13 , and oscillation revival again beyond the window .",
    "the window of coupling strengths that gives rise to fixed points is very sensitive to the frequency of switching , at low frequencies .",
    "after a high enough switching frequency ( i.e. low enough @xmath12 ) , the fixed point region remains unchanged , as evident through the fact that fig .",
    "[ fig : bs_periodic_fixed_t_switch]a and fig .",
    "[ fig : bs_periodic_fixed_t_switch]b are identical .",
    "now , the dependence of the fixed point window on @xmath13 is actually quite counter - intuitive , as already indicated in the bifurcation diagrams . for rapidly switched coupling forms , at large coupling strengths",
    ", the oscillation suppression occurs at an _ intermediate _ value of @xmath13 .",
    "namely , as the dominance of similar - variable coupling @xmath13 increases the oscillations are first suppressed and then after a point the oscillations are revived again , with the window of fixed points shifting towards higher @xmath13 , as coupling strength increases . this is counter - intuitive , as similar - variable coupling is known to only allow oscillations , while dissimilar - variable coupling can yield some windows of oscillation suppression . also interestingly for low @xmath13 ,",
    "as we increase the coupling strength , first we encounter oscillation suppression and then on further increase of coupling strength the oscillations are restored .",
    "so there exists an intermediate window of coupling strength that yields fixed point dynamics .",
    "fig  [ fig : bs_periodic_fixed_f_sim ] shows the basin stability of the fixed point state , in the parameter space of the frequency of switching and coupling strengths , for different @xmath13 .",
    "it is clear again that after a critical switching frequency the dynamics does not depend on the rate at which the coupling form is changed .",
    "significantly , it is also evident that _ fast changes in coupling form , namely lower time period for change , yields large fixed point regions in parameter space .",
    "_ however , at low switching frequencies the emergent dynamics is sensitive to how rapidly the coupling form varies .     and @xmath13 .",

    "[ fig : bs_probabilistic_fixed_t_switch]a and fig .",

    "[ fig : bs_probabilistic_fixed_p ] shows the basin stability of the fixed point state , in the parameter space of frequency of switching and coupling strengths .",
    "clearly the effects of the frequency of switching are pronounced over a larger range of switching frequency for probabilistic switching , as compared to periodic switching .",
    "but significantly again , it is evident that _ fast changes in coupling form , namely lower time period for change , yields large fixed point regions in parameter space . _",
    "lastly , it is also clear that as the frequency of switching increases , the fixed point region moves towards higher values of @xmath36 where similar - variable coupling dominates .",
