    "moreover we assume @xmath233 and hence the ground state of the island contains an even number of electrons at any gate voltage .",
    "given this layout for the device , we expect the supercurrent to be suppressed by the ` coulomb blockade ' effect@xcite .",
    "however , for specific values @xmath234 of the gate voltage the energies of two even charge states differing by @xmath235 become degenerate . at these ` coulomb resonances ' the suppression of the josephson current through the island",
    "is lifted and we find a large superflow .",
    "we can control the supercurrent by changing the gate voltage and hence the sset constitutes a transistor device .",
    "the above discussion shows that the sset and the rjt are like devices , switching on as levels become degenerate ; while for the sset these levels belong to fixed charge states of the island , for the rjt these levels derive from transmission resonances . in both cases",
    "the degeneracy is lifted by the josephson coupling @xmath236 , where the coupling constant @xmath237 is related to the transmission of the nis boundaries , see below .",
    "furthermore , the sset and the rjt exhibit largely the same current - voltage characteristic close to these level degeneracies , @xmath238 where the parameters @xmath237 and @xmath239 have to be specified for each device .",
    "in fact , ( [ sc ] ) yields the current through a symmetric sset@xcite if we substitute the energy parameter @xmath237 by the coupling energy @xmath229 and the dimensionless constant @xmath239 by the small ratio @xmath240 . using the ambegaokar - baratoff relation@xcite and the landauer formula@xcite we can reexpress the coupling energy in terms of more microscopic quantities : @xmath241 , where @xmath242 denotes the number of open channels in the tunnel junction",
    ", @xmath243 denotes its area , and @xmath244 its transmission coefficient .",
    "on the other hand , the rjt involves the parameters @xmath245 and @xmath246 .",
    "again , the resonance width is determined by geometrical quantities : @xmath247 , where @xmath244 is the transmittivity of the insulator layer in the triple barrier@xcite .",
    "for flat inner barriers the quasi - classical method provides the simplification @xmath248 , with @xmath249 . note that , while charging effects dominate the physics of the sset these are much less relevant for the rjt as the latter involves an ` open wire ' rather than a ` closed island ' ; the adiabatic joints to the superconducting banks provide reservoirs which effectively screen the charge transport through the wire .    from eq .",
    "( [ sc ] ) we can determine the critical supercurrent @xmath250 as a function of the gate voltage near @xmath251 .",
    "apparently , @xmath252 defines a current peak of width @xmath253 that attains its maximum @xmath254 at the degeneracy point .",
    "we estimate its slope by the ratio @xmath255 carrying the dimension of a conductance . for the sset @xmath256",
    "is determined through the small capacitance ratio @xmath257 .",
    "the analogous quantity for the rjt is of order unity , implying that the rjt shows a more prominent slope : with @xmath258 , and @xmath259 we have to determine the suceptibility of the channel width @xmath260 with respect to the gate voltage @xmath261 . making use of simple electrostatic considerations",
    "one easily finds that @xmath262 , where @xmath263 denotes the bohr radius in the semiconductor material @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath264 and with @xmath263 of order 10 nm typically we arrive at a value of order unity for the parameter @xmath239 .",
    "comparable energy scales @xmath265 can be reached in realistic short sinis junctions ( @xmath266 ) .",
    "furthermore , we can optimize the performance of the rjt by tuning the transparency of the insulating layers ( the dirac @xmath47-scatterers ) until the resonance width @xmath150 approaches the resonance spacing @xmath94 ; such a choice of parameters produces still isolated current peaks of maximum height . on the other hand , the maximum superflow through",
    "the sset scales with the number @xmath267 of open channels , @xmath268 , while the rjt as defined above is generically a single channel device with a critical supercurrent @xmath269 ; going over to a many channel rjt device , resonances from individual channels superpose at _ different _ values for the chemical potential and hence do not add up in general @xcite .",
    "also , a smoothing of the resonance structure has been observed in the numerical results by wendin _",
    "@xcite    summarizing , superconducting transistors can be designed in terms of ` charge ' ( the sset ) or ` phase ' devices ( the jt ) . in the charge device",
    ", the island is separated from the superconducting leads through insulating barriers . on the other hand ,",
    "switching channels in a perfect sns junction one obtains a phase device with a ( large ) critical current @xmath270 determined by the effective time @xmath271 the charge needs to traverse the normal wire@xcite .",
    "such devices with perfect interfaces are difficult to fabricate  in reality we always have to account for a non - ideal transmission @xmath272 through the sin interfaces and we end up with a fabry - perot type resonator device .",
    "sequential tunneling through the interface barriers then reduces the supercurrent by a factor @xmath273 in general .",
    "however , tuning the chemical potential to a scattering resonance the critical current of the junction remains large , @xmath274 of order @xmath244  again , the critical current is given by the time @xmath275 the charge spends in the junction .    a second result we wish to emphasize here concerns the fact that the critical current is carried by the lowest quasi - particle level alone .",
    "this has been demonstrated for the sns device in ref . and",
    "above for the sinis junction for the case of strong resonances ( deviations from the single level result are numerically ( but not parametrically ) larger away from weak resonances ) . the importance to know the dispersion of this level then provides a good _ a posteriori _",
    "reason for studying the quasi - particle spectrum in such junctions .",
    "corresponding spectroscopic experiments can be realized using multiprobe devices as proposed in the work of van wees _ et al . _",

    "below we make use of the wave vectors @xmath281 and @xmath282 describing particles of energy @xmath237 in the wire close to the boundaries . the global transmission amplitude @xmath283 is most easily obtained by determining the transfer - matrix@xcite of the barrier between @xmath284 and @xmath285 and we find the result @xmath286 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote the transmission and reflection amplitudes of the inner smooth barrier . in ( [ t_step ] ) we have introduced the definitions @xmath287 and @xmath288 containing the information about the steps . in our example ,",
    "@xmath187 , @xmath289 , and @xmath290 show a weak dependence on energy and remain almost constant while @xmath291 oscillates rapidly .",
    "the derivation of ( [ t_step ] ) makes use of the relation @xmath292 , @xmath293 , which follows from the unitarity of the scattering matrix ; the term @xmath294 changes sign at each perfect resonance of @xmath290 .",
    "since the inner barrier was assumed to be smooth , we expect @xmath290 to exhibit no resonances at all and the term @xmath295 always carries a positive sign .",
    "next , we show that ( [ t_step ] ) qualitatively reproduces the transmission amplitude shown in fig .  2 . we definine the function @xmath296 , whose four arguments @xmath41 , @xmath187 , @xmath289 , and @xmath290 depend on the energy .",
    "since the inner scattering phase @xmath41 is the most energy sensitive argument we minimize @xmath297 with respect to @xmath41 ( keeping @xmath187 , @xmath289 , and @xmath290 fixed at a given energy @xmath237 ) .",
    "thus we obtain the stationary phases @xmath298 belonging to the minima of @xmath297 .",
    "moreover , we can introduce the complex valued function @xmath299=z[\\chi^{t_i}_{\\rm min}(e),\\kappa(e),\\sigma(e),t_i(e)]$ ] , which is roughly constant when compared to @xmath300 $ ] .",
    "we can estimate the resonance energies by solving the equation @xmath301=z_{\\rm",

    "@xmath300 $ ] describes an ellipse in the complex plane with half axes @xmath302 and @xmath303 .",
    "the center of this ellipse is shifted away from the origin by @xmath304 .",
    "8 illustrates the behavior of @xmath305 when @xmath306 grows from 0 to 1 in the intermediate region @xmath307 $ ] ( with a smooth inner barrier , @xmath306 is strictly monotonous , @xmath308 for @xmath309 and @xmath310 for @xmath311 ) .",
    "the distance from the origin to the bottom of the ellipse ( point @xmath312 ) is always extremal . at high energies where @xmath313",
    ", we observe _ perfect _ resonances : with @xmath314 these resonances are realized at the symmetric points @xmath315 and @xmath316 where the ellipse touches the unit circle , see fig .",

    "@xmath318 ( @xmath319 ) the reflection coefficient @xmath306 drops to zero , and @xmath312 becomes the closest point to the origin with @xmath320 ; the resonances then have paired up and have become _ imperfect _ , with a height decaying rapidly with decreasing energy @xmath237 .    physically , this resonance structure originates from the interplay of two competing transparencies .",
    "the transmission probability through the potential steps is almost constant and much smaller than the transparency of the inner barrier for @xmath321 . in this regime",
    "the particles propagate freely and are reflected by the steps alone ; thus we observe perfect resonances , and the shape of the smooth inner barrier only influences the resonance spacing . on the other hand , for @xmath322",
    "the inner barrier behaves like a hard wall while the steps are comparatively transparent .",
    "the global transmission through the barrier bounded by the steps is suppressed by the tunneling through the classically inaccessible region .",
    "the resonances of the subsystems consisting of a step and a potential hill account for the global imperfect resonances . note that the barrier bounded by steps generates pronounced resonances only if @xmath323 .      in a second step",
    "we investigate the transmission amplitude through three arbitrary symmetric potential barriers , i.e. , a triple barrier , see fig .",
    "the inner barrier is again smooth , whereas the two outer barriers ( characterized by the transmission and reflection amplitudes @xmath324 and @xmath325 ) are assumed to be equal .",
    "thus the global transmission amplitude takes the form @xmath326 in order to determine the resonance structure we evaluate the extrema of the modulus of the denominator in ( [ t_triple ] ) with respect to @xmath327 ( we fix @xmath290 and @xmath328 , which are less sensitive to changes in energy ) .",
    "a direct calculation yields the two extremal conditions @xmath329 ( i ) and @xmath330 ( ii ) .",
    "elementary manipulations show that the transmission amplitude exhibits _ perfect _ resonances in the first case . but condition",
    "i can only be satisfied as long as @xmath331 , i.e. , for a reasonably transparent inner barrier ( see fig .  9 ) . the extremal condition  ii requires a second distinction .",
    "condition  ii(a ) reads @xmath332 , @xmath293 .",
    "the critical points of this type always belong to local minima of @xmath27 .",
    "finally , we discuss condition  ii(b ) , @xmath333 , @xmath293 , which refers to local minima when @xmath334 and characterizes _ imperfect _ resonances in the regime @xmath335 . since the internal barrier was assumed to be smooth , the regime of perfect resonances lies at high energies @xmath336 , where @xmath337 and @xmath338 . at low energies @xmath339 ,",
    "the resonances are always imperfect . within the crossover region",
    "the perfect resonances attract each other pairwise and collapse to become imperfect as the energy decreases ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "other sources of resonances are discontinuities of the force @xmath340 and effective mass steps",
