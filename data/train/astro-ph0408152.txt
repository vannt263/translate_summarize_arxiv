    "einstein s general theory of relativity ( gtr ) has proved to be one of the most successful physical theories ever formulated . as a theory of the gravitational interaction",
    ", it has a number of predictions definitely corroborated by experiments or astronomical observations , which makes it the correct gravity theory here - to - fore .",
    "after readdressing an earlier study , einstein ( 1936 ) @xcite came up with the prediction of the gravitational lensing effect .",
    "the idea is that the gravitational field produced by a massive astrophysical object , the sun for instance , can act as a convergent lens able to deviate light rays flying - by .",
    "observations of far away quasars and galaxies and more familiar total solar eclipses confirm the reality of this phenomenon .",
    "more than half of the star s surface may be seen by a distant observer .",
    "this means that a photon emitted at a given colatitude on the star s surface , reaching the observer at infinity , must be emitted at a smaller angle with respect to the normal at that point .",
    "because of this effect , a distant compact star must then appear to any observer larger then it actually is .",
    "the relation between the apparent radius @xmath1 of a spherical ( non - rotating ) star , as seen by a distant observer , and its physical radius @xmath2 is    @xmath3    this relation is obtained from the photon trajectory in polar coordinates ( @xmath4 ) by using a schwarzschild metric    @xmath5    here @xmath6 is the schwarzschild radius of the star of mass @xmath7 . as is clear from this line - element no effects from physical fields other than the gravitational have been taken into account in prescribing the star apparent size .",
    "paper _ shows that the phenomenon changes in a fundamental fashion if nled is called into play .",
    "the analysis below , based on well - known nonlinear lagrangeans , as the heisenberg - euler ( h - e , @xcite ) and the exact born & infeld ( 1934 ) ( b - i @xcite ) , proves that when nled is included to describe the photon dynamics , the trajectory depends on the background @xmath0-field pervading the star .",
    "we stress from the very beginning that the results below are obtained upon an idealization of the @xmath0-field structure . in a real star ,",
    "the @xmath0-field is neither purely radial nor constant , so that the apparent radius hardly goes to zero at high @xmath0 .",
    "we stress in passing that this theory _ is not a new theory of gravitation_. in our formalism einstein s general relativity remains definitively unaltered . only the photons propagating out of the ultramagnetized neutron stars  see \" the effective metric that appears once one incorporates nled into a self - consistent physical description of light propagation from those stars .",
    "that nled is a theory already tested in a number of experiments is demonstrated by the laboratory experiment described by burke , field , horton - smith , et al .",
    "( 1997 ) @xcite , as quoted below .",
    "our theory attempts to call to the attention of the astrophysics community the fundamental changes that should appear in determining physical properties as radius , mass , and more crucial : the equation of state , of neutron star pulsars endowed with extremely strong magnetic fields , since a property as the star radius ( which can be estimated from the x - ray variability of very short period of the star emission ( light curve ) , or by measuring the gravitational redshift of absorption or emission lines received from the star surface , or etc . )",
    "can say too much about the stellar structure and its equation of state . a fundamental property that encodes basic information of the physical constituents of the neutron star matter .",
    "according to quantum electrodynamics ( qed : see delphenich 2003 @xcite for a complete review on nled and qed ) a vacuum has nonlinear properties @xcite , which affect the photon propagation .",
    "a noticeable advance in the realization of this theoretical prediction has been provided by burke , field , horton - smith , et al .",
    "( 1997 ) @xcite , who demonstrated experimentally that the inelastic scattering of laser photons by gamma - rays is definitely a nonlinear phenomenon . the propagation of photons in nled has been examined by several authors ( bialynicka - birula & bialynicka - birula 1970 ; salazar et al .",
    "1989 ; dietrich & gies 1998 ; de lorenci 2000 ; denisov & svertilov 2003 ; alarcon 1981 ; garcia & plebanski 1989 ; boillat 1970 ; vazquez et al . 1969 ; torrence 1984 ; garcia 1984 ) @xcite . in the geometric optics approximation",
    ", it was shown by novello et al .",
    "( 2000 ) @xcite ; and novello & salim ( 2001 ) @xcite , that when the photon propagation is identified with the propagation of discontinuities of the em field in a nonlinear regime , a remarkable feature affloats : the discontinuities propagate along null geodesics of an _ effective _ geometry which depends on the em field on the background .",
    "this means that the nled interaction can be geometrized , in analogy to gravity in gtr .",
    "a key outcome of this formalism is introduced in this _",
    "paper_.      the h - e @xcite lagrangean    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is a quantum parameter , is a gauge invariance description of the photon propagation in nled that uses two invariants    @xmath10    constructed upon the maxwell em tensor and its dual .-",
    "fields smaller than @xmath11  g ( schwinger s critical @xmath0-field ) . ]",
    "the method of characteristic surfaces or shock waves followed here ( introduced by hadamard ( 1903 ) @xcite ) can be applied to any field theory having hyperbolic field equations , including electrodynamics .",
    "hence , the result in eq.([fg - metric ] ) ( see appendix ) , implies two possible paths of propagation or polarization modes , according to the double solution @xmath12 . using eq.([h - e ] ) to compute the lagrangean derivatives",
    "@xmath13 , one arrives to the couple of effective metrics ( first order in @xmath14 )    @xmath15    in terms of electric ( @xmath16 ) and magnetic ( @xmath0 ) fields the tensor @xmath17 can be written as    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the normalized @xmath20 , eq.([schw ] ) ) velocity of the reference frame where the fields are measured .",
    "our main concern here is the behavior of photons , in the nled context , emitted from a highly magnetized neutron star .",
    "corotating charges in the pulsar magnetosphere or a rotating magnetic dipole lead to induced @xmath16-fields in the star surface .",
    "we consider here slowly rotating neutron stars in order that the @xmath16-field contribution could be neglected . since @xmath21 , the above expression simplifies to : @xmath22 .",
    "its self - product reads    @xmath23    where @xmath24 . after discarding a nonphysical conformal factor",
    "the effective metrics become    @xmath25    the inverse ( covariant ) metric of eq.([contrav - metric ] ) is obtained from the relation @xmath26 , which then reads    @xmath27    by @xmath28 we mean @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in order to pursue our calculations",
    "we assume a radial magnetic field .",
    "this is clearly not realistic , but is an approximate description of the field geometry near the polar caps of a magnetized neutron star .",
    "thus    @xmath31    and consequently one arrives to the effective metric components    @xmath32    notice the structural similarity of both metric components . from eq.([l - dependent ] ) is straightforward to rewrite the expression for the apparent radius of the spherical star in eq.([r - max ] ) in the putative background metric given by eq.([schw ] ) .",
    "after doing so , one can compute the ratio of the star area with h - e nled effects included to the area without ( einstein s derivation ) , as seen from the distant observer .",
    "this quantity is represented here by @xmath33 .",
    "is a solution of the nled field equations , to compute the ratio `` @xmath34 '' is only needed to know the local ( on the star surface ) magnitude or modulus of the field . in the particular case of the computation of the null geodesics discussed below , is indeed necessary to know the analytic expression for the field as a function of the coordinates , in particular of the radial @xmath35-coordinate .",
    "unfortunately , such a solution for the magnetic field structure ( or dependence on the coordinates ) is only known for the linear ( maxwell s ) case . ]",
    "= 6.6 cm      as stated above , `` @xmath34 '' is intended to be a quantity describing the ratio between the area of the star as seen by an observer at infinity that receives the actual traveling luminous ray , and the actual physical area of the neutron star , both projected on the plane of the sky .",
    "this ratio of areas can be consistently figured out by the following qualitative reasoning .    in a general relativistic framework ,",
    "the local neutron star luminosity is defined as    l_= 4 r^2__sb t_^4 ,    where @xmath36 is the neutron star radius and @xmath37 is its temperature . both measured locally at the star surface .",
    "the luminosity measured by the observer at infinity , which carries the information on the spacetime metric around the neutron star , is defined    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the @xmath40-metric component of a schwarzschild spacetime , i.e. ,    @xmath41    notice that @xmath42 . on the other hand ,",
    "the luminosity at infinity can be written as    @xmath43    thus , the temperature measured by an observer at infinity relates to the actual star temperature via    @xmath44    therefore , after manipulating all these relations one arrives to the relation between both the star radii ( local and at infinity )    @xmath45    in an equivalent approach , once one realizes that the star luminosity is modified by the spacetime geometry induced by the matter distribution , one can readily verify that in the case of nled its geometric effects on the photon propagation from the ultra magnetized neutron star leads to an expression that is similar to the one above .",
    "hence , one can write , taking into account the general relativistic effects superposed to the nled effects , the local neutron star luminosity as given by    @xmath46    the luminosity measured by the observer at infinity , which carries the information on the spacetime metric as modified by nled , as in the heisenberg - euler ( h - e ) nled , now reads    @xmath47\\ ] ]    or equivalently ,    @xmath48    where the term @xmath49 $ ] now substitutes the @xmath40-metric component of the pure schwarzschild spacetime presented above .",
    "notice that in this case the effective @xmath40-metric component reads    @xmath50~ .\\ ] ]    this implies that    @xmath51 }    =   \\frac { \\left [   1 - { \\tilde{\\beta}}^2_{\\pm } b^2 \\right ] } { g_{tt } } .\\ ] ]    thus , the temperature measured by an observer at infinity now reads    @xmath52^{1/2 } ~ .\\ ] ]    once again , after manipulating these relations one obtains    @xmath53    from these relations one can write the area ratio `` @xmath34 '' that estimates the magnitude of the change in the apparent visible area of the star as seen from infinity compared to the actual star area , as measured by a local observer :    = = .",
    "hence , by substituting the corresponding terms in these last equations one arrives to    = ( ) =   .",
    "as one can notice , in this new expression for the area ratio there is no any functional of the @xmath35 coordinate but rather only a function of the magnetic field strength at the surface of the neutron star .",
    "this is the reason of why we took @xmath0 as a constant in the numerical calculation leading to the plots in figures 1 , and 2 .",
    "the propagation of light from hypermagnetized neutron stars can also be viewed within the framework of the born - infeld lagrangean    @xmath54    where @xmath55 as is well known , this is an exceptional lagrangean .",
    "one of its remarkable properties is that it does not exhibit birefringence @xcite . in this case , the deduction we present in the appendix fails since the quantities @xmath56 , with @xmath57 ; vanish identically .",
    "we need hence to go back to eq.([eq25],[eq26 ] ) ; and substituting in these equations the form for @xmath58 of eq.([exc ] ) to obtain a unique _ characteristic equation _ , which then leads to the effective metric    @xmath59    using the self - product of the tensor @xmath17 given by ( [ eq80 ] ) , and noting that in our case @xmath60 , the effective metric then reads ( see reference @xcite for details )    @xmath61    by computing the inverse metric via @xmath62 , the covariant form of this effective metric is obtained as    @xmath63    after recalling the relations for @xmath64 and @xmath65 given in eq.([4-vectors ] ) , one can verify that the covariant @xmath66 effective metric component is then written as    @xmath67~ g_{r r } \\ ; .\\ ] ]    = 6.6 cm = 6.6 cm    by following steps similar to the h - e case , the area ratio is presented in fig.2 . although our hypothesis about the field geometry maximizes the nled effect on the observed properties of the star , they should properly be taken into account when analyzing the x - ray emission .",
    "( this point will be considered in a forthcoming paper ) .",
    "it should also be relevant in pondering the effects on supernova dynamics of photons radiated either by highly magnetized proto - neutron stars ( miralles et al .",
    "( 2002 ) @xcite ) or stellar - mass black holes enshrouded by super strong @xmath0-fields ( see van putten et al .",
    "( 2004 ) @xcite ) .",
    "a self - consistent treatment of this problem does require the study of the light propagation in the neutron star spacetime geometry modified by nled",
    ". in nled the lagrangean defined by eq.([schw ] ) becomes    @xmath68    where @xmath69 .",
    "the resulting euler - lagrange equations read ( with @xmath70 ; @xmath71 ) :    ( - 2 g^eff_tt u^t ) = 0 g^eff_tt u^t = e_0 , [ tt - component ]    ( 2 g^eff _",

    "the euler - lagrange equation for the @xmath66-component of the metric can be obtained from the ( first integral ) relation    @xmath75    in analogy with the planetary system one can chose a particular `` orbital '' plane at @xmath76 , so that @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and thus @xmath79 . by making use of the standard change of variables",

    "( notice that eq.([nonlinear ] ) is quite similar to that one obtains in the case of the photon propagation in a schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "nonetheless , we stress that in order to find such a solution ; an analogous procedure as the one usually pursued in general relativity ( _ the perturbation approach _ ) does not work in the present case , since for the extremely large magnetic field we are considering the induced nled effects are of the same order of magnitude as those purely obtained from gravitation . ) besides , one needs to know the function @xmath89 , which is a solution of the born - infeld equations for this problem . perhaps a numerical solution can be found , but that would require extra work that we think would not add too much to the new results we are presenting in this version of the paper .",
    "( a full detailed solution will be given elsewhere ) .",
    "eqs.([photon - traject],[nonlinear ] ) shows very clearly that nled does modify the standard propagation of photons as compared to that one in a pure schwarzschild gravitational field @xcite , as described in most textbooks of gtr",
    ". a first look at eq.([photon - traject ] ) suggests that very large @xmath0-fields do reduce the effective star s visible area .",
    "the nonlinear electrodynamics is a well stablished theory of the electromagnetic interaction , which overcomes the failure of maxwell s theory in describing the stability of atomic structures . since its introduction in physics by euler and heisenberg @xcite it has gained the status of a theory with a strong experimental support ( for a recent complete review see delphenich ( 2003 ) @xcite ) . despite being known since long",
    ", its very key features have become recognized only in the late years ( see references above ) .",
    "it had been shown in the last few years ( novello et al2000 ; novello & salim 2001 ) that the force acting along the photons trajectory can be geometrized in such a way that in an effective metric @xmath90 the photons follow geodesic paths in that effective geometry ( novello et al2000 ; novello & salim 2001 ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , the effects of nonlinear electrodynamics in the physics of strongly magnetized neutron stars have been recently studied by mosquera cuesta & salim ( 2003 ; 2004 ) @xcite .",
    "it was shown there that for extremely supercritical magnetic fields nonlinear electrodynamics effects force photons to propagate along accelerated curves , in such a way that the surface gravitational redshift of emission lines from hypermagnetized neutron stars , as measured by a distant observer , is significantly modified .",
    "such a new effect turns out to be of the same order of magnitude of the one produced by the pure gravitational field .    in this paper",
    ", we present a new astrophysical application of the peculiar effects brought by nled , which is intimately related to the one previously discussed by ( mosquera cuesta & salim 2003 ; 2004 ) @xcite .",
    "we show that the famous gravitational lensing effect , originally introduced by einstein , is also modified when the electromagnetic ( nonlinear ) effects are taken into the depiction of the physics around strongly magnetized neutron stars .",
    "such a dynamics is described by using both the euler - heisenberg and the born - infeld approaches to nled .",
    "incidentally , we show , by comparing eqs.([l - dependent ] ) and ( [ effective - metric ] ) , that eq.([l - dependent ] ) clearly exhibits a divergence .",
    "such an unphysical behavior , in turn , invalidates the results presented by denisov et al . in ref .",
    "@xcite obtained within the h - e approach , since they extended to the case of magnetars ( neutron stars having @xmath0-fields @xmath91  g ) their formula to estimate the light - ray bending angle beyond the qed @xmath0-field limit .",
    "that is inconsistent . besides , both approaches : the h - e and the b",
    "- i nled induce critical changes in the @xmath66 metric component that modifies the quantification of the lensing effect .",
    "more relevant , yet , the area of a putative star may appear to a distant observer nonphysically diminished in h - e nled , whereas it is physically largely reduced , and may even `` disappear '' , for fields @xmath92  g in the b - i approach",
    ". the impact of this on the star flux may be dramatic .",
    "thence , the effect introduced by ( mosquera cuesta & salim 2003 ; 2004 ) @xcite and this new here crucially alters the dynamics of photons from very high @xmath0-field stars , while entangles ( makes it difficult ) the inference of their physical properties .    to the very end",
    ", what kind of observations can be performed in a search for this peculiar effect ?",
    "as light is the prime messenger from the stars , one can look for variability of very short period in the x - ray ( or @xmath93-ray ) light curves from most hypermagnetized pulsars .",
    "a comparative analysis of the characteristics of those light curves with the ones from canonical pulsars may render the clues on the presence of nled effects .",
    "a similar analysis can be pursued by using the measurements of the surface gravitational redshift of that kind of hypermagnetic stars .",
    "following hadamard ( 1903 ) @xcite , the surface of discontinuity of the em field is denoted by @xmath94 .",
    "the field is continuous when crossing @xmath94 , while its first derivative presents a finite discontinuity .",
    "these properties are specified as follows : @xmath95_{\\sigma } =   0\\ ; , $ ] 0.3 truecm @xmath96_{\\sigma } = f_{\\mu\\nu}k_\\lambda \\ ; \\protect \\label{eq14 } \\;$ ] , where the symbol @xmath95_{\\sigma } =   \\lim_{\\delta \\to 0^+ } \\left(j|_{\\sigma + \\delta}-j|_{\\sigma - \\delta}\\right)$ ] represents the discontinuity of the arbitrary function @xmath97 through the surface @xmath94 . the tensor @xmath98 is called the discontinuity of the field , @xmath99 is the propagation vector , and the symbol `` @xmath100 '' stands for partial derivative .    here -",
    "after we investigate the effects of nonlinearities of very strong @xmath0-fields in the evolution of em waves ; described onwards as the surface of discontinuity of the em field ( represented here - to - fore by @xmath17 ) . extremizing the lagrangian with respect to the potentials @xmath101 yields the following field equation :                                      we seek thus for a master relation representing the propagation of field discontinuities , which should be independent of the quantities @xmath112 , that is , independent of @xmath113 and @xmath114",
    "there is a simple way to achieve such a goal .",
