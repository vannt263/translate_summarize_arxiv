    "xray clusters of galaxies are efficient tracers of the mass in the universe and can be studied out to large redshifts . prior to the launch of the rosat x - ray telescope , the only high redshift ( @xmath4 ) x - ray selected cluster sample was that of the einstein extended medium sensitivity survey ( emss ; henry et al .",
    "1992 ; gioia & luppino 1994 ) .",
    "henry et al .",
    "( 1992 ) used the emss to show x - ray clusters evolved ` negatively '  the space density of high luminosity clusters being lower in the redshift range @xmath5 compared to @xmath6 .",
    "this result was in conflict with popular models of cluster formation ( e.g. kaiser 1986 ) and prompted further significant theoretical work ( e.g. kaiser 1991 ; evrard & henry 1991 ) .",
    "the maturing of the rosat database has sparked much recent interest in testing this result . a large cluster sample with a median depth of @xmath7 , created from the rosat all sky survey ( rass ) , shows no sign of evolution out to @xmath8 ( ebeling et al .",
    "castander et al .",
    "( 1995 ) presented the first look at the high redshift cluster population with rosat , claiming that the evolution seen by henry et al .",
    "( 1992 ) extends to luminosities @xmath9 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "we have recently shown ( collins et al .",
    "1997 ) , using the southern sharc sample of serendipitously detected clusters from deep rosat pspc pointings , that the number of high redshift clusters is consistent with a no evolution model , in direct contrast to castander et al .",
    "finally , the emss sample has been re - analysed in the light of new optical and x - ray data , which indicates that the evidence for evolution seen by henry et al .",
    "( 1992 ) is not statistically significant ( nichol et al .",
    "1997 ) .    in this letter we present the high redshift x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) of the collins et al .",
    "( 1997 ) cluster sample . in section [ xlf ]",
    "we describe the calculation of the xlf from this sample and in section [ discussion ] we discuss the results . throughout this letter",
    "we have assumed h@xmath10 km / s / mpc and @xmath11 and quoted luminosities in the 0.5 to 2.0 kev pass band , unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "the cluster sample used in this letter is the southern sharc survey , consisting of 16 clusters in the redshift range @xmath0 with a median redshift of @xmath12 , detected in a serendipitous survey of 66 deep rosat pspc pointings , covering a total search area of @xmath13 deg@xmath14 .",
    "this area is slightly larger than that used in collins et al .",
    "( 1997 ) due to the use of a different central source mask .",
    "each pointing satisfies the following criteria : exposure time greater than 10 ks , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "further details of the sample are given in collins et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and a description of the full survey will be presented in a future paper .    for each cluster",
    "the count rate was measured from the background - subtracted count rate image in the 0.5 to 2.0 kev pass band .",
    "the chosen aperture encloses 80% of the light and was determined from a convolution of a king surface brightness profile with a model of the off - axis point spread function , using a cluster core radius of 250 kpc and @xmath17 ( jones & forman 1984 ) . justification for the adopted values of these cluster parameters is given below .",
    "after accounting for the flux falling outside this aperture , we used a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum of temperature 6 kev ( typical of nearby clusters ) and a galactic absorption model to convert the total count rate into a flux , and then into rest frame luminosities , @xmath18 , in both the 0.5 to 2.0 kev and 0.3 to 3.5 kev pass bands .",
    "we chose to use a thermal bremsstrahlung model because cluster x - ray emission is dominated by the continuum radiation rather than line emission ( e.g. sarazin 1988 ) and for its computational ease of use . to investigate the uncertainty introduced by using a single temperature we have used a luminosity - temperature relation ( wang & stocke 1993 ) to obtain iterated estimates of the cluster luminosities .",
    "these values are within 1% ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) and 4% ( 0.3 - 3.5 kev ) of those obtained above and the difference is negligible compared to the poission errors of the photon counts , which has a median value of @xmath19 .",
    "we have performed extensive simulations to model the effect of using an extent criterion to select cluster candidates .",
    "the ability to detect a given cluster depends on properties both intrinsic and extrinsic to the cluster  the relevant cluster characteristics are its luminosity , surface brightness profile and redshift ; those for the survey are exposure time , background count rate and off - axis angle .",
    "the simulations assume a universal cluster x - ray surface brightness profile , namely the king model with a core radius of 250 kpc and @xmath20 ( jones & forman 1984 ) , that is independent of redshift .",
    "ideally one would use a distribution encompassing the true range of cluster profiles , however the sensitivity and spatial resolution of the current generation of x - ray instruments limit the knowledge of such a distribution to low redshift .",
    "our choice of profile is consistent with the average properties of low redshift cluster samples ( e.g. henry et al . 1992 ; jones & forman 1984 ) . as the simulations are computationally intensive we limited our analysis to a binned representation of the survey with regard to exposure time , background count rate and off - axis angle .",
    "the bin sizes were chosen so as to be small enough that the selection function did not vary significantly across a bin whilst being large enough that the simulations could be performed in a reasonable time .",
    "for each bin a range of cluster luminosities ( @xmath21 ) and redshifts ( @xmath22 ) were used ; simulated clusters were generated by randomly distributing source photons using the king profile convolved with a model pspc psf and background photons using a flat background model .",
    "the number of source and background photons were poisson distributed about the expected number .    multiplying the selection function of a given bin by the survey area for the bin and summing over all the bins produces @xmath23 , the available survey area as a function of cluster luminosity and redshift , shown in figure [ fig : area - vs - redshift ] .",
    "the survey volume for a cluster with luminosity @xmath18 , in a redshift shell @xmath24 to @xmath25 , is @xmath26 , defined as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the volume per square degree at a redshift @xmath29 .",
    "figure [ fig : vol - vs - lum ] shows equation ( [ eqn : vmax ] ) evaluated for the redshift shell @xmath0 using the curves from figure [ fig : area - vs - redshift ] where the solid line indicates the fit used to interpolate these points .",
    "we have used both parametric and non - parametric forms to define the cluster xlf ; a brief description follows and a full account of the fitting procedure can be found in nichol et al .",
    "the non - parametric xlf , @xmath30 , was calculated using @xmath31 where the sum is performed over all clusters whose luminosities , @xmath32 , are within @xmath33 of @xmath18 . for a model xlf @xmath34 ,",
    "the parametric form was determined by maximising the likelihood @xmath35 , given by @xmath36 where the product is over the cluster detections and @xmath37 is a normal distribution , with mean  and standard deviation equal to the error on , which models the effect of luminosity errors on the fitting procedure .    in figures [ fig : rosat - xlf ] and [ fig : emss - xlf ] we show the non - parametric xlf , for the redshift shell @xmath0 , calculated using equations ( [ eqn : vmax ] ) and ( [ eqn : xlf - binned ] ) for both the 0.5 - 2.0 kev and 0.3 - 3.5 kev pass bands . table [ tbl : xlf - binned ] lists the data points shown in these figures .",
    "we fitted two parametric forms to the data : a power law ( e.g. henry et al . 1992 ) , @xmath38 and a schechter function ( e.g. ebeling et al . 1997 ) , @xmath39 as we are not sensitive to the characteristic luminosity , @xmath40 , of the schechter function , we used the best fit values from ebeling et al .",
    "( 1997 )  @xmath41  ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) and @xmath42  ( 0.3 - 3.5 kev ) . the likelihood for a given @xmath34 is independent of the normalisation ( @xmath43 or @xmath44 ) , so we fixed this by setting the expected number of clusters equal to the number in our sample .",
    "this procedure gives some weight to luminosities where no clusters were detected , producing a steeper slope than the non - parametric xlf would suggest ( henry et al .",
    "errors on @xmath45 and @xmath46 were calculated by integrating the normalised likelihood distributions , which are well approximated by a gaussian , out to an enclosed area of 68.3% and those for the normalisations were found by allowing @xmath45 to take its one - sigma values .",
    "the results are listed in table [ tbl : xlf - fit ] and shown graphically in figures [ fig : rosat - xlf ] and [ fig : emss - xlf ] .",
    "from figure [ fig : rosat - xlf ] it is qualitatively obvious that , for @xmath47 erg s@xmath2 , our @xmath0 cluster xlf is consistent with that of the low redshift cluster xlf .",
    "our best fit faint end slope for the schechter function , @xmath48 , agrees with that of the low redshift cluster sample of ebeling et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who find @xmath49 .",
    "the power - law slope in the emss pass band ( @xmath50 ) is also consistent with the slope of the low redshift shell of henry et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and the re - worked emss sample of nichol et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , for which @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively .",
    "the lack of luminosity evolution agrees with our recent analysis of the redshift distribution of the southern sharc clusters ( collins et al .",
    "1997 ) and is inconsistent with the strong evolution claimed by castander et al .",
    "our results strengthen , and extend to higher redshift , recent claims that cluster properties remain the same out to @xmath53 ( e.g. ebeling et al .",
    "1997 ; mushotzky & scharf 1997 ) .",
    "the only other published xlf for x - ray selected clusters covering our redshift range is that of henry et al .",
    "( 1992 ) from 21 emss clusters between @xmath54 , with a median redshift of 0.33 .",
    "they find a much steeper power - law slope of @xmath55 , which they claim is the result of negative evolution .",
    "our xlf is consistent with the non - parametric xlf of henry et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for luminosities @xmath56  ( 0.3 - 3.5 kev ) , as shown in figure  [ fig : emss - xlf ] , hence any evolution of the cluster population is restricted to luminosities @xmath57 . using the ebeling et al .",
    "( 1997 ) xlf , and assuming 100% detection efficiency , we find that the surface density of clusters with @xmath58 , in the redshift range 0.3 to 0.7 , is 0.083 deg@xmath59 and the expected number of such clusters in the southern sharc survey is only @xmath60 . therefore the lack of high luminosity clusters in our sample is not unexpected . in figure",
    "[ fig : emss - xlf ] , we plot equation ( 6 ) of henry et al .",
    "( 1992 ) using their best - fit values of @xmath61 and @xmath62 mpc@xmath2 , for @xmath63 , corresponding to the median redshift of the joint cluster sample .",
    "this analytical model is based on the press - schechter formalism and is shown here simply to provide a physical basis for extrapolating the emss data and comparing the two samples . in the context of general cluster formation theories , our result is broadly consistent with the predictions of entropy - based models or a low value of the density parameter ( e.g. kaiser 1991 ; evrard & henry 1991 ; henry et al . 1992 ; oukbir & blanchard 1997 ; bower 1997 ; mathiesen & evrard 1997 ) .",
    "we have used the southern sharc survey to create the first @xmath4 xlf derived from rosat detected clusters of galaxies .",
    "comparison with the low redshift cluster xlf of both rosat ( ebeling et al .",
    "1997 ) and emss ( henry et al . 1992 ) clusters shows that there is no evolution in the x - ray luminosities of @xmath47 erg s@xmath2 clusters at a median depth of @xmath64 .",
    "this is consistent with our analysis of the redshift distribution of this cluster sample ( collins et al .",
    "1997 ) and adds further weight to the body of evidence for no evolution in the cluster population .",
