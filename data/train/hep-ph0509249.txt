    "the recent high - precision experimental determination of @xmath3  @xcite has led to intense interest in the corresponding standard model ( sm ) prediction  @xcite .",
    "the largest of the non - pure - qed sm contributions , that due to the leading order hadronic vacuum polarization , @xmath4_{had}^{lo}$ ] , can be obtained as an appropriately - weighted integral over the electromagnetic ( em ) spectral function , @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 component of @xmath5 is related to that of its charged current @xmath6 partner , measured in hadronic @xmath0 decay , by cvc .",
    "recent attempts to incorporate @xmath0 decay data into the evaluation of @xmath4_{had}^{lo}$ ] using the isospin - breaking ( ib ) corrected version of this relation  @xcite have encountered a consistency problem in the dominant ( @xmath7 final state ) contribution to @xmath4_{had}^{lo}$ ] .",
    "specifically , even after accounting for known sources of ib  @xcite , the @xmath7 component of the resulting @xmath0-based @xmath6 vector spectral function is incompatible with that obtained from the high - precision cmd2 @xmath8 data  @xcite , with surprisingly large ( @xmath9 ) discrepancies remaining in the region of @xmath10 invariant masses from @xmath11 to @xmath12 gev  @xcite .",
    "sm predictions for @xmath2 based solely on electroproduction ( em ) data indicate a @xmath13 deviation from the experimental result , while those based on the ib - corrected hadronic @xmath0 decay data indicate compatibility at the @xmath14 level  @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy thus significantly impacts the question of whether or not the current experimental determination of @xmath2  @xcite shows evidence for beyond - the - sm contributions .    to resolve the above discrepancy",
    ", we have investigated sum rule constraints on the em and @xmath0-decay - based data sets , working with sum rules of the form @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the relevant threshold , @xmath17 is the correlator with spectral function @xmath18 , @xmath19 is a function analytic in the region of the contour , and the ope representation of @xmath17 is to be used on the rhs . at intermediate scales ,",
    "weights satisfying @xmath20 must be employed , in order to suppress duality violating contributions from the vicinity of the timelike point  @xcite .",
    "this is most conveniently done by using the variable @xmath21 and weights @xmath22 satisfying @xmath23 .",
    "integrated ope contributions of dimension @xmath24 then scale as @xmath25 , allowing reliable self - consistency checks for the absence of neglected higher @xmath24 contributions .    in the current study , to be specific , we employ the aleph data and covariance matrix  @xcite ( with updated normalization ) for the hadronic @xmath0 decay version of the isovector vector spectral function . for the various exclusive components of the em spectral function and their errors , we follow the assessments of refs .  @xcite .",
    "more recent high - precision data is incorporated as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the region of the em-@xmath0 discrepancy",
    ", we focus on the cmd2 @xmath7 data . the weights , @xmath22 , and scales , @xmath1 , used in this study have been chosen in such a way that ( i ) the ope is essentially entirely dominated by its @xmath26 contribution , ( ii ) the convergence of the integrated @xmath26 series , order - by - order in @xmath27 , is excellent , and ( iii ) poorly known @xmath28 contributions are absent  @xcite .",
    "the ope sides of the various sum rules are then determined , up to very small non - perturbative corrections , by the single input parameter , @xmath29 , for which we employ an average of high - scale determinations independent of the em and @xmath0 data being tested  @xcite . the values relevant to lower scales are obtained by standard four - loop running and matching  @xcite .    for illustration",
    ", we present below results for three weight cases , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "the first weight has a zero of order @xmath34 at @xmath35 , the remaining weights zeros of order @xmath36 .",
    "the weights are all non - negative in the integration region , simplifying the interpretation of the sum rule tests .",
    "a discussion of other advantages of these weights may be found in ref .",
    "we find that the @xmath0-decay - based spectral integrals are compatible with the high - scale ope input for a wide range of @xmath1 , but that the em data yields spectral integrals consistently lower than those predicted by the ope  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 dependence of the ope and corresponding spectral integrals is also in good agreement for the @xmath0 case , but in significant disagreement for the em case  @xcite .",
    "figures may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    regarding the normalization of the em spectral integrals : to quantify the normalization discrepancy , we have used the spectral integral values at the highest accessible common scale for the em and @xmath0 cases ( @xmath37 ) to obtain an effective value for @xmath29 .",
    "this is to be compared to the independent high - scale average , @xmath38 .",
    "the results are shown in table 1 .",
    "while the values implied by the em data are low by only @xmath39 , typical fluctuations in the data which would bring them into better agreement with ope expectations would also serve to increase @xmath40_{had}^{lo}$ ] . the @xmath0 data , in contrast , yields @xmath29 values in good agreement with the high - scale average . somewhat lower values of @xmath29 are also easily accommodated since the overall normalization uncertainty for the @xmath0 data corresponds to an uncertainty of @xmath41 in the fitted @xmath29 .",
    "the problem of the @xmath1 dependence of the em spectral integrals is similarly quantified in table 2 , for @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath44 are the slopes with respect to @xmath1 of the spectral and ope integrals , respectively .",
    "ope entries labelled `` indep '' correspond to the high - scale average @xmath29 input above , those labelled `` fit '' to the fitted values given in table 1 .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath44 is seen to be very small .",
    "the very weak dependence on @xmath27 means that even the change from `` indep '' to `` fit '' input on the ope side has only marginal impact , the ope versus spectral integral slope discrepancy being reduced from @xmath45 to @xmath46 for @xmath30 and @xmath47 to @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "the source of the slope problem thus lies entirely on the data side .",
    "the problem can be cured only by a change in the shape of the em spectral distribution , such as would occur if the ib - corrected @xmath0 data , rather than the em data , represented the correct version of @xmath50 .",
    "we conclude that either ( i ) non - one - photon physics effects , as yet unidentified , are contaminating the em data or ( ii ) there remain experimental problems with the ( pre-2005 ) em data .",
    "the latter conclusion is favored by the just - released snd @xmath8 results  @xcite , which are compatible with the ib - corrected hadronic @xmath0 decay data . in either case",
    "it follows that determinations of @xmath51_{had}^{lo}$ ] incorporating @xmath0 decay data are favored over those based solely on em cross - sections and hence that the sm prediction for @xmath2 is in good agreement with the current experimental result .    a final comment concerns the ib correction associated with @xmath52-@xmath53 `` mixing '' .",
    "the current standard evaluation  @xcite is based on a chirally - constrained model ( the `` gp / cen model '' ) fitted to a since - corrected form of the cmd2 data .",
    "because of strong cancellations , the model dependence of the integrated @xmath40_{had}^{lo}$ ] interference contribution turns out to be significantly larger than any one model s fitting - induced uncertainty  @xcite . table 3 shows the results of fits to the cmd2 data for the gounaris - sakurai ( gs ) , hidden local symmetry ( hls ) , and kuhn - santamaria ( ks ) models , as well as two versions of the gp / cen model  @xcite , one a refitting to the current version of the cmd2 data ( gp / cen@xmath54 ) , the other a refitting which incorporates an additional phase , such as arises when direct ib @xmath55 decay contributions are taken into account ( gp / cen@xmath56 ) . smaller values of @xmath57_{\\rho -\\omega}$ ] also serve to reduce the difference between the em and @xmath0-based determinations of @xmath58_{had}^{lo}$ ] .",
