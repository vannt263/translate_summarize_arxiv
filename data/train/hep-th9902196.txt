    "type 0 string theories @xcite have recently attracted a lot of attention .",
    "the hope is that information on non - supersymmetric gauge theories can be extracted by embedding them in these non - supersymmetric string theories @xcite . as in the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence for type ii string theory @xcite , d - branes play a crucial role in this conjectured string theory / gauge theory correspondence . in this paper , we will be concerned with the relation between type 0 d - branes and the supersymmetric type ii d - branes . we will show how certain results , well established in the type ii context , can be extended to the type 0 one .    in the neveu - schwarz - ramond formulation ,",
    "type ii string theories are obtained by imposing independent gso projections on the left and right moving part .",
    "this amounts to keeping the following ( left , right ) sectors : & & ( ns+,ns+ )  ,  ( r+,r+ )  ,  ( r+,ns+ )  ,  ( ns+,r+ )  ; + iia:&&(ns+,ns+ )  ,  ( r+,r- )  ,  ( r+,ns+ )  ,  ( ns+,r- )  , where for instance r@xmath5 is the ramond sector projected with @xmath6 , @xmath7 being the world - sheet fermion number .    there is another , equivalent choice for both theories ( related to the first choice by a spacetime reflection ) : & & ( ns+,ns+ )  ,  ( r-,r- )  ,  ( r-,ns+ )  ,  ( ns+,r- )  ; + iia:&&(ns+,ns+ )  ,  ( r-,r+ )  ,  ( r-,ns+ )  ,  ( ns+,r+ )  .for the massless r - r sector the difference between the primed and unprimed theories shows up in opposite chiralities of the bi - spinor containing the r - r field strengths .",
    "this implies a sign difference in the poincar duality relations among these field strengths , resulting in a selfdual five - form field strength in iib and an antiselfdual one in iib , for instance .",
    "the type 0 string theories contain instead the following sectors : & & ( ns+,ns+ )  ,  ( ns-,ns- )  ,  ( r+,r+ )  ,  ( r-,r- )  ; + 0a:&&(ns+,ns+ )  ,  ( ns-,ns- )  ,  ( r+,r- )  ,  ( r-,r+ )  .these theories do not contain bulk spacetime fermions , which would have to come from `` mixed '' ( r , ns ) sectors .",
    "the inclusion of the ns - ns sectors with odd fermion numbers means that the closed string tachyon is not projected out .",
    "the third difference with type ii theories is that the r - r spectrum is doubled : the r - r potentials of the primed and unprimed type ii theories are combined , resulting for instance in an unconstrained five - form field strength in type 0b .",
    "because of the doubling of the r - r spectrum , there are in type 0b two kinds of d3-branes , named electric and magnetic in constrast to the selfdual d3-brane of type iib .",
    "the recent literature has developed in two main directions .",
    "first , the gauge theory on a superposition of a large number of electric branes was studied , leading to non - supersymmetric , non - conformal , tachyon - free gauge theories @xcite .",
    "second , equal numbers of electric and magnetic d3-branes were superposed , giving a non - supersymmetric large @xmath8 conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will be mostly interested in the second situation .",
    "a superposition of equally many electric and magnetic branes is reminiscent of the type ii branes ( see section 2 ) , which have been well studied .",
    "it will turn out that a lot of results can be transferred to type 0 almost without effort .",
    "for instance ( section 3 ) , chiral fermions are present on certain intersections of electric and magnetic branes , leading to anomaly inflow on the intersection via anomalous d - brane couplings .",
    "these , in turn , lead to the creation of a string when certain d - branes cross each other .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the configuration of many type iib d3-branes sitting at a @xmath0 orbifold singularity was considered , and the spectrum of the corresponding supersymmetric world - volume theory was described . in section 4 ,",
    "we consider the analogous type 0 situation .",
    "we will derive the non - supersymmetric massless spectrum of equally many electric and magnetic type 0 branes at a @xmath0 orbifold singularity .",
    "the theory can be seen as an orbifold of the large @xmath8 conformal field theory @xcite of equally many electric and magnetic d3-branes in flat space . according to an argument of ref .",
    "@xcite , it is still conformal in the large @xmath8 limit . we have checked this by computing that the gauge coupling beta function vanishes , in that limit , up to two - loop order .    in many respects",
    "type 0 string theory is the result of a clever way of breaking supersymmetry . in taking the orbifold from type ii to type 0 the resulting theory , although non - supersymmetric , still exhibits features reminiscent of the parent theory . from the strong resemblances between type ii and type 0 string theories ,",
    "one may hope to draw more conclusions about non - supersymmetric theories by reinterpreting old results from supersymmetric string theory in this new context .",
    "d - branes in type 0 theories have been discussed in refs @xcite and @xcite . in this section",
    "we mainly review some of their results .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the spectrum of type 0 theories contains two ( @xmath9)-form r - r potentials for each even ( 0a ) or odd ( 0b ) @xmath10 .",
    "we will denote these by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , referring to the unprimed and primed type ii theories mentioned above . for our purposes ,",
    "more convenient combinations are [ c+- ] ( c_p+1)_=(c_p+1c_p+1 )  . for @xmath13",
    "these are the electric ( @xmath14 ) and magnetic ( @xmath15 ) potentials @xcite .",
    "we will adopt this terminology also for other values of @xmath10 .",
    "there are four types of `` elementary '' d - branes for each @xmath10 : an electric and a magnetic one ( _ i.e. _ , charged under @xmath16 ) , and the corresponding antibranes . in ref .",
    "@xcite the interaction energy of two identical parallel ( @xmath9)-branes was derived by computing the relevant cylinder diagram in the open string channel , analogously to the polchinski computation  @xcite in type ii . isolating , via modular transformation , the contributions due to the exchange of long - range fields in the closed string channel , it is found on the one hand that the tension of these branes is a factor @xmath17 smaller than for type ii branes . on the other hand ,",
    "the r - r repulsive force between two like branes has the double strength of the graviton - dilaton attraction @xcite ; thus the type 0 branes couple to the corresponding r - r potentials @xmath16 with the same charge as the branes in type ii couple to the potential @xmath11 .",
    "the cylinder diagram between two d - branes in type ii can also be considered as a tree - level diagram in which a closed string propagates between two `` boundary states '' . a boundary state is a particular brst invariant closed string state that describes the emission of a closed string from a d - brane .",
    "it satisfies conditions that correspond to the boundary conditions for open strings ending on the d - brane . in particular , for the fermionic fields @xmath18 the boundary state @xmath19 , which depends on the sector , r or ns , and on an additional sign @xmath20 , satisfies ( ^-s^ _  ^)|b,_ns , r=0  , where @xmath21 is diagonal , with entries @xmath22 in the worldvolume and @xmath23 in the transverse directions .",
    "in type ii theories , the gso projection requires a mixture of the two choices @xmath24 . indeed , starting ,",
    "_ e.g. , _ with @xmath25 ,",
    "one finds that the type ii boundary state @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 is @xmath29    we remark that in the case of type 0 d - branes , the various cylinder amplitudes between an electric ( or magnetic ) d - brane and an electric ( or magnetic ) one can simply be reproduced using the following unprojected ( and differently normalized ) boundary states , whose sum is @xmath30 times the type ii one : [ b+- ] |b,=(|b,_ns |b,_r )  . here @xmath31 represents an electric brane and @xmath32 a magnetic one . as a cross - check , with these boundary states",
    "it is easy to compute the one - point function on the disc of a r - r potential ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . denoting by @xmath33 the state corresponding to the @xmath16 potentials , the one - point function describing its coupling to a type",
    "0 d@xmath10-brane will be @xmath34 .",
    "this gives indeed the same charge as in type ii , where we would compute @xmath35 , as we can see from eqs ( [ c+-],[am1],[b+- ] ) .",
    "the d - branes described in the previous section showed many similarities to their type ii cousins . in this section",
    "we will push the analogy further to include the whole wess - zumino action , _",
    "i.e. _ , all the anomalous d - brane couplings .",
    "the open strings stretching between two like branes are bosons , just like the bulk fields of type 0 .",
    "however , fermions appear from strings between an electric and a magnetic brane @xcite . thus one could wonder whether there are chiral fermions on the intersection of an electric and a magnetic brane .",
    "consider such an orthogonal intersection with no overall transverse directions .",
    "if the dimension of the intersection is two or six , a cylinder computation reveals that there are precisely enough fermionic degrees of freedom on the intersection to form one chiral fermion .    in type ii string theory",
    ", the analogous computation shows that chiral fermions are present on two or six dimensional intersections of two orthogonal branes with no overall transverse directions . that observation has had far reaching consequences .",
    "namely , the presence of chiral fermions has been shown to lead to gauge and gravitational anomalies on those intersections of d - branes @xcite . in a consistent theory ,",
    "such anomalies should be cancelled by anomaly inflow @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "the anomaly inflow is provided by the anomalous d - brane couplings in the wess - zumino part of the d - brane action @xcite .",
    "these anomalous couplings have an anomalous variation localized on the intersections with other branes .    to sketch how this anomaly inflow comes about , let us focus on the case of two type iib d5-branes ( to be denoted by d5 and d5 ) intersecting on a string .",
    "the wess - zumino action on d5 contains a term of the form @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the r - r two - form potential and @xmath38 a certain four - form involving the field strength of gauge field on d5 and the curvature two - forms of the tangent and normal bundles of d5 . to be precise",
    ", one should replace this term by @xmath39 , with @xmath40 and @xmath41 the complete gauge - invariant field strength of @xmath37 ( which generically differs from @xmath42 ) . with the additional information that the gauge variation of the `` chern - simons '' form @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 for some two - form @xmath45",
    ", it is easy to see that the anomalous term on d5 will have a variation localized on the intersection with d5 : _ d5h_3_3=_d5dh_3i_2= _",
    "d5d*h_7 i_2= _",
    "d5_d5i_2  .",
    "a careful analysis of all the anomalies @xcite shows that the anomalous part of the d@xmath10-brane action is given , in terms of the formal sum @xmath46 of the various r - r forms , by s_wz=_p+1 ce^2f+b  . here",
    "@xmath47 denotes the d@xmath10-brane tension , @xmath7 the gauge field on the brane and @xmath48 the ns - ns two - form .",
    "further , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the curvatures of the tangent and normal bundles of the d - brane world - volume , and @xmath51 denotes the a - roof genus : [ aroof ] & = & 1+(r_t^2-r_n^2 ) + ( r_t^2-r_n^2)^2 + & & + ( r_t^4-r_n^4)+   .",
    "this action has been checked in refs @xcite by computing various string scattering amplitudes .",
    "these anomalous d - brane couplings have various applications . to mention just one , using t - duality it has been argued @xcite that they imply the creation of a fundamental string whenever certain type ii d - branes cross each other .",
    "this string creation process is dual to the hanany - witten effect @xcite .",
    "let us now return to type 0 string theory . as stated above , here chiral fermions live on intersections of electric and magnetic type 0 d - branes .",
    "the associated gauge and gravitational anomalies on such intersections match the ones for type ii d - branes . to cancel them , the minimal coupling of a d@xmath10-brane to",
    "a ( @xmath9)-form r - r potential should be extended to the following wess - zumino action : [ wzaction ] s_wz=_p+1(c)_^2f+b  .",

    "( [ wzaction ] ) distinguishes between electric and magnetic branes .",
    "note that @xmath47 denotes the tension of a type ii d@xmath10-brane , which is @xmath17 times the type 0 d@xmath10-brane tension .",
    "the argument that the variation of this action ) .",
    "] cancels the anomaly on the intersection is a copy of the one described above in the type ii case , apart from one slight subtlety . for definiteness , consider the intersection of an electric and a magnetic d@xmath52-brane on a string .",
    "varying the electric d@xmath52-brane action ( exhibiting the @xmath53 potential , or rather , its field strength @xmath54 ) , one finds that the variation is localized on the intersection of the electric d@xmath52-brane with branes charged magnetically under the @xmath54 field strength . using eq .",
    "( [ c+- ] ) , the different behaviour under poincar duality of the r - r field strengths of type ii and ii shows that these are precisely the branes carrying ( electric ) @xmath55 charge , _",

    "d5_+_d5_-i_2  .",
    "a completely analogous discussion goes through for the variation of the magnetic d@xmath52-brane action .",
    "this anomaly inflow argument fixes ( the anomalous part of ) the wess - zumino action , displayed in eq .",
    "( [ wzaction ] ) .",
    "the presence of these terms ( and of a similar non - anomalous one @xcite ) can be checked by a disc computation , as in type ii @xcite .",
    "in fact , up to the cancelling factors mentioned at the end of the previous section , the computation is precisely the same , confirming the form of the action ( [ wzaction ] ) .    assuming t - duality to hold between type 0a / b , the arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite lead to the creation of a fundamental string when certain electric and magnetic branes cross each other . in type",
    "ii this is linked to the hanany - witten effect @xcite by a chain of dualities .",
    "however , this chain involves s - duality , of which we do not know a type 0 analogue .",
    "in this section we want to find the open string spectrum on a system of @xmath8 electric and @xmath8 magnetic type 0 d - branes at an orbifold fixed point . as in section 2",
    "the type 0 situation closely parallels the well - understood type ii case . in type iib theory , d5-branes sitting at the singularity of a @xmath56 orbifold",
    "are _ defined _ by d5-brane configurations on the covering space @xmath57 . here and below @xmath58",
    "denotes a discrete subgroup of su@xmath59 .",
    "the definition is such that the action of @xmath58 is extended to include the ( open string ) chan - paton factors .",
    "let us take @xmath60 for concreteness . to describe @xmath8 d5-branes on this orbifold , one starts with @xmath61 d5-branes on @xmath57 , reflecting that if a point @xmath62 is an allowed open string endpoint , then so are its image points under the orbifold group .",
    "the open string sector thus consist of a vector @xmath63 ( @xmath64 and 4 scalars @xmath65 ( @xmath66 in the adjoint of su@xmath67 .",
    "the spacetime action of @xmath68 is diagonal on the complex scalars @xmath69 and @xmath70 : its generator sends @xmath71 into @xmath72 , where @xmath73 .",

    "there are @xmath82 vector multiplets for different su@xmath83 groups , and @xmath82 hypermultiplets that transform each in the bifundamental of a couple of su@xmath83 factors , as encoded in a type ii `` quiver diagram '' @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) : each dot represents a vector multiplet in one of the su@xmath83 factors and each link a bifundamental half hypermultiplet .",
    "next , let us consider the analogous situation for @xmath8 electric and @xmath8 magnetic type  0 d - branes . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the flat space case , one starts with @xmath84 type ii d - branes , derives the type ii open string spectrum next , and finally performs a @xmath85 projection to find the type 0 spectrum .",

    "the type 0 field content is as follows .",
    "the massless bosons are :    * 1 vector and 2 real scalars in the adjoint of each of the @xmath82 @xmath89 factors of the gauge group ; * @xmath82 complex scalars , each in the representation @xmath90 of two @xmath89 factors , as encoded in a type 0 quiver diagram , wich we will introduce shortly , see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "the type 0 quiver diagram that summarizes the information about the spectrum requires only a slight modification of the quiver rules in ref .",
    "for instance , in our @xmath68 case , one draws @xmath82 pairs consisting of a filled and an empty dot , representing the groups of electric and magnetic branes , respectively ; one then draws oriented links between any two dots inside one pair or in neighbouring pairs .",
    "the spectrum can be read off using the following rules :    1 .",
    "every dot represents the bosonic content of an su@xmath83 vector multiplet ; 2 .",
    "every link connecting two like dots corresponds to spacetime bosons ; 3 .",
    "every link between an empty and a filled dot corresponds to spacetime fermions ; 4 .",
    "a link represents the bosonic or fermionic truncation of either a vectormultiplet ( in the case of links within a pair ) or half a hypermultiplet ( for links from one pair to a neighbouring one ) , transforming in the bifundamental of the gauge groups corresponding to the dots it connects .",
    "as we saw in section 2 , in terms of unprojected r and ns boundary states one can with equal ease describe type ii and type 0 d - branes .",
    "one can thus directly compute in the closed string channel the one - loop open string free energy that encodes the free spectrum of the gauge theory on the branes , both for type ii and for type 0 .",
    "we give now in some detail the closed - string description of the configuration treated above , namely d - branes sitting at an orbifold singularity ( see also @xcite ) ; in particular , we will show how to incorporate the non - trivial action of the orbifold group on the chan - paton factors .",
    "as far as we know , this prescription is new , also in the type iib context .",
    "let us thus consider d5-branes on @xmath0 .",
    "the theory possesses @xmath82 closed string sectors , distinguished by the periodicity properties of the fields ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref .",
