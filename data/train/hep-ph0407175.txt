    "scalars are very controversial mesonic states .",
    "their internal structure is not yet understood .",
    "there are different models in which the scalars are treated as simple @xmath4 mesons , @xmath5 states , @xmath3 bound states or mixed states including glueballs .",
    "two scalar - isovector resonances @xmath0 and @xmath1 have been observed experimentally .",
    "the @xmath0 mass is close to the @xmath3 threshold so one should check whether the @xmath0 is a @xmath3 quasi - bound state .",
    "we study the properties of the @xmath6 s within the @xmath2 and @xmath3 coupled channel model described in ref .  .",
    "it is based on the separable interactions between mesons : @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the c. m. momenta , @xmath10 are the coupling constants , @xmath11 are the form factors and @xmath12 are the range parameters .",
    "we fix four parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 by choosing the @xmath17-matrix poles related to both @xmath0 and @xmath1 resonances and the fifth parameter @xmath18 by comparing the @xmath19 branching ratio for the @xmath0 with the experimental value.@xcite below we present some of our results .",
    "more of them can be found in refs .  .",
    "and @xmath3 channels , height=166 ]    in fig .  [ fig : distrib ] the effective mass distributions obtained in the flatt parametrisation of the crystal barrel collaboration data @xcite and in the coupled channel model @xcite are compared .",
    "the phase space factors are defined as @xmath20 and the production amplitudes are given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the effective masses , @xmath23 are the channel momenta , @xmath24 are the coupling constants , @xmath25 is the mass parameter and @xmath26 is the normalization constant .",
    "the production amplitudes are related to the elastic and the transition cross sections by : @xmath27 and @xmath28    the flatt formula describes only a range of the mass distributions near the @xmath0 resonance while our coupled channel model describes both the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 resonances .",
    "for example , we can predict the @xmath19 branching ratio in the @xmath1 mass range .",
    "we have calculated it in two mass ranges . for a typical range , between @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31  mev and @xmath32  mev one obtains a value of @xmath33 .",
    "the branching ratio is equal to @xmath34 if @xmath35  mev and @xmath36  mev .",
    "our predictions are in a good agreement with the experimental value @xmath37 given by the crystal barrel collaboration.@xcite    each resonance decaying in two channels is related to two poles of the @xmath17-matrix in the complex momentum planes .",
    "the @xmath0 resonance lies close to the @xmath3 threshold .",
    "both poles corresponding to this state are close to the physical region and influence strongly the @xmath2 and @xmath3 amplitudes . having fixed all the model parameters we have obtained an attractive force in the @xmath3 channel . now",
    "the question is whether a strength of the @xmath3 force is sufficient to create a kaon - antikaon bound state .",
    "a pole position in the @xmath3 _ uncoupled _ channel gives us some information about the nature of the @xmath0 state .",
    "if a bound state exist then it is connected with a pole on the positive part of the imaginary axis in the complex momentum plane . to arrive to a conclusion",
    "we have gradually _ reduced _ the interchannel coupling from its value down to zero and studied the pole trajectories . in fig .",
    "[ fig : traj ] the trajectories of two @xmath0 poles and two zeros are shown . in the uncoupled case the pole",
    "@xmath38 meets the zero related to the pole  @xmath39 and is cancelled by it . in the same way the pole  @xmath39 is cancelled by the zero related to the pole  @xmath38 .",
    "it means that in this limit both poles disappear from the @xmath3 channel so the @xmath0 resonance can not be interpreted as a @xmath3 bound state .",
    "we have constructed the @xmath40 and @xmath3 coupled channel model .",
    "this five - parameter unitary model allows one to describe simultaneously both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 states .",
    "all the parameters have been fitted to experimental values of the masses and widths of both @xmath6 s and to the @xmath41 branching ratio measured near the @xmath3 threshold .",
    "the production amplitudes near the @xmath0 resonance and the @xmath41 branching ratio for the @xmath1 resonance , predicted by us , are in good agreement with the crystal barrel collaboration results . within our model and taking into account the existing experimental data the @xmath0 resonance can not be interpreted as a @xmath3 bound state .",
