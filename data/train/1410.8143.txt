    "after 40 years of intense theoretical and computational research , the answer has been a qualified  and unsatisfying ",
    "`` maybe . ''",
    "it has long been known that molecular viscous diffusion is wholly inadequate to drive accretion because the transport timescale is several orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe : @xmath3  gyr for conditions typical at @xmath4  au in a protoplanetary disk ( ppd ) with kinematic viscosity @xmath5 , thermal velocity @xmath6  km / s , molecular mean free path @xmath7 1  cm .",
    "@xcite proposed that keplerian differential rotation may be susceptible to hydrodynamic and/or magnetohydrodynamic instabilities that would drive turbulent diffusion , for which they introduced an `` eddy '' viscosity : @xmath8 ( the idea being that turbulent `` blobs '' would move at subsonic speeds over distances of order the scale height , and the parameter @xmath9 would subsume all our ignorance over the details of the transport efficiency ) .",
    "because the specific angular momentum increases with radius in keplerian differential rotation , it is often stated that keplerian shear is stable to purely hydrodynamic instabilities .",
    "however , this centrifugal stability criterion @xcite is strictly true only for axisymmetric perturbations in an unstratified , inviscid flow , and therefore is of limited relevance for _ stratified _ astrophysical disks .",
    "so , what is the nature of hydrodynamic instabilities that may lead to enhanced transport ? historically , by analogy with poiseuille ( pressure - driven ) and couette ( viscous - driven ) flows in both planar and cylindrical geometries , the go - to mechanism has been subcritical finite - amplitude instabilities that extract energy from the shear at very high reynolds numbers @xcite",
    ". this has been , and remains , highly controversial .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have argued , with theory and computational analyses , that the coriolis force stabilizes keplerian shear and shuts off any way ( in the absence of magnetic fields ) for perturbations to extract energy from the differential rotation in order to power sustained turbulence .",
    "others have argued that even the best to - date numerical simulations lack sufficient resolution to capture nonlinear triggering of instabilities at very high reynolds numbers @xcite . a related mechanism to generate shear turbulence starts with the transient amplification of a special class of initial conditions , which may trigger nonlinear feedback and continued growth if the amplitude of the transients peak above some critical threshold @xcite .",
    "however , none of these  by - pass to turbulence \" approaches regenerate the initial perturbations required to sustain turbulence after the initial burst of turbulence has decayed .    with conflicting results in both theory and numerical work",
    ", one may hope that laboratory experiments may provide an independent test .",
    "unfortunately , two recent taylor - couette flow experiments ( water rotating between two concentric cylinders ) have yielded opposite results : experiments by @xcite claim a positive measurements of turbulence and outward transport of angular momentum ; whereas , a similar set of experiments by @xcite claim no such evidence of turbulence nor angular momentum transport .",
    "the measurements are difficult and sensitive to the ability of the experimentalists to control secondary flows from their apparatus ( e.g. ,  ekman pumping ) .",
    "direct numerical simulations of taylor - couette flows with laboratory boundary conditions seem to confirm that the axial boundaries are driving the instabilities and enhanced transport @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that magnetic fields could destabilize otherwise stable rotational flows .",
    "balbus and hawley were the first to apply this magnetorotational instability ( mri ) to keplerian shear flows and demonstrate how the resulting turbulence efficiently transported angular momentum outward @xcite .",
    "however , there exist relatively dense , cool and nearly neutral regions in ppds ( approx .  1 - 10 au ) that likely lack sufficient coupling between matter and magnetic fields @xcite , except perhaps in thin surface layers that have been ionized by cosmic rays or protostellar x - rays @xcite .",
    "the magnetically - decoupled regions are known as `` dead zones '' and there is continued research into whether waves and turbulence from the magnetically - coupled mri - active regions can propagate into the dead zones of ppds and drive motions that result in angular momentum transport or disrupt the settling of dust @xcite .    in regions of a laminar near - keplerian disk that are",
    "strongly coupled to magnetic fields , there is no question that of all the known relevant linear instabilities , mri is the fastest to grow to large amplitude .",
    "however , the presence of dead zones in ppds still motivates researchers to investigate other mechanisms for instability and transport , especially because the dead zone seems to be coincident with planet - forming regions within disks @xcite .",
    "a large class of potential instabilities involve global properties of the disk , specifically radial gradients of thermodynamic quantities .",
    "extrema in the radial profile of potential vorticity ( a.k.a .",
    "vortensity ) is unstable to rossby waves which eventually roll - up into vortices @xcite .",
    "radial entropy gradients that are stable according to the solberg - hiland criterion can still be unstable to a `` subcritical baroclinic instability '' ( sbi ) that is most effective when the thermal cooling time is of order an orbital period @xcite .",
    "more recent work on the sbi by @xcite has shown that the instability is actually linear ( i.e. ,  does not require large amplitude perturbations ) and more akin to a convective overstability rather than a traditional baroclinic instability .",
    "still others have investigated vertical shear instabilities ( vsi ) related to the goldreich - shubert - fricke instability in rotating stars @xcite .",
    "while zvi needs vertical stable stratification ( e.g. ,  entropy increasing in direction opposite of gravity and sufficiently long thermal relaxation times ) the vsi needs vertically neutral stratification ( e.g. ,  no vertical entropy gradient , or sufficiently short thermal relaxation times ) . thus depending on the thermodynamic structure of the disk and its optical properties",
    ", one or the other might locally dominate .    of course , by direct observation",
    ", we know that _ some _ mechanisms exist within a ppd that leads to the transport of angular momentum in the way that is needed to complete star formation and that allows dust to accumulate and agglomerate into kilometer - sized planetesimals . however , the elucidation of that mechanism or mechanisms can not be sloughed off as an unimportant `` detail . ''",
    "a more realistic treatment of turbulence is essential to quantify the spatial and temporal distribution of dust in a ppd and therefore affects our modeling of the infrared emission from dust ( relevant for alma & jwst observations ) , as well as an initial - mass function ( imf ) for planets .      in (",
    "* hereafter bm05 ) , we investigated the stability of three - dimensional vortices in the midplanes of protoplanetary disks .",
    "we created a model for a near - equilibrium vortex , which we initialized by hand in our spectral anelastic code that had specially tailored algorithms to handle shear , rotation and stratification @xcite .",
    "the vortex suffered a linear instability which resulted in its destruction near the midplane , but we unexpectedly discovered that the stratified regions away from the midplane naturally filled with robust vortices . at the time , we speculated that the initial midplane vortex excited internal gravity waves , which propagated away from the midplane and deposited their energy in stratified regions where the shear rolled vorticity perturbations into new vortices .",
    "however , our original explanation was not entirely complete nor satisfying .",
    "* hereafter mpjh13 ) correctly diagnosed the true mechanism for the formation of these vortices and in the process identified a new instability , which we now call the  zombie vortex instability \" or zvi . in order to get at the essential nature of the phenomenon ,",
    "mpjh13 stripped out complicating features of a protoplanetary disk ( e.g. ,  spatially varying gravity and brunt - visl frequency ) and numerically investigated simple couette flow with constant gravity and constant brunt - visl frequency in the limit of the boussinesq approximation . in this far simpler system",
    ", mpjh13 found that a small perturbing vortex could trigger an instability in a rapidly - rotating , strongly stratified flow , yielding vigorous , space - filling vortices , vortex layers and turbulence .",
    "figure [ f : zombie_cartoon ] is a cartoon picture summary of the mechanism outlined in mpjh13 .",
    "each panel shows a small patch of a ppd in frame rotating with the gas ; upward is the forward azimuthal direction , rightward is increasing radius from the protostar . in the rotating frame",
    ", the background flow appears as an anticyclonic shear ( as indicated with the arrows ) .",
    "color illustrates vertical vorticity ( aligned with the rotation axis of the disk ) , with red indicating cyclonic ( out of the page ) vorticity and blue indicating anticyclonic ( into the page ) vorticity .",
    "the domain is initially filled with kolmogorov turbulence on small scales ( panel a ) . at low rossby number ( when the coriolis effect is dominant over advection )",
    ", the turbulence can undergo a `` reverse cascade '' in which energy transfers to larger scales as small regions of vorticity merge with other regions of vorticity with the same sense of rotation .",
    "regions of vorticity that have the same sense of rotation as the background shear tend to roll - up into compact vortices , whereas vorticity patches with the opposite sense of rotation as the background shear tend to get stretched out into thin layers @xcite .",
    "after a period of reverse cascades and mergers , a region of the disk may only be populated with a few isolated anticyclones that move with the shear and interspersed with cyclonic vortex layers ( panel b ) . in our simplified cartoon ,",
    "we consider a small region with only one remaining anticyclone .",
    "this vortex acts as a source of perturbations and waves .",
    "the crucial new insight in mpjh13 was the recognition of `` baroclinic critical layers '' as being sites that are receptive to perturbations .",
    "critical layers are special locations in a shear flow where the coefficients of the highest derivatives of the linearized equations vanish , indicating that the neutrally - stable eigenmodes are singular there @xcite .",
    "because our focus in this paper is to demonstrate the existence of zvi , we will defer the mathematics of critical layers to a future paper .",
    "for our purposes here , we note that there exist multiple critical layers on either side of the source vortex .",
    "let @xmath10 be local cartesianized radial , azimuthal , and vertical directions within a small box rotating with the gas .",
    "the cross - stream distance @xmath11 between the source and the @xmath12th critical layer is given by ( mpjh13 ) : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the brunt - visl frequency , @xmath15 is the local shear rate , @xmath16 is a spatial wavenumber associated with a fourier component of the source vortex , @xmath17 is the domain size in the azimuthal direction , and @xmath12 is some non - zero integer .",
    "the critical layer closest to the source , without intersecting the source itself , has the largest integer @xmath18 . at first glance",
    ", it may appear that the closest critical layer depends on the arbitrary choice of the domain size in the azimuthal direction , but in numerical experiments , the physical location of the first excited critical layer is always just outside the perturber , and the value of the integer @xmath18 will scale with @xmath17 .",
    "critical layers for smaller integers @xmath19 are also excited .",
    "the critical later farthest from the source generally has @xmath20 and is at a distance @xmath21 .",
    "however , if a boundary of the domain in the cross - stream direction is too close to the source , or if there are physics that prohibit vortex coherence over distances as large @xmath22 , then the excited critical layer farthest from the perturbing source will have @xmath23 . in the calculations presented here the boundaries",
    "are chosen so that the farthest excited critical layer is 1 , and the equations of motion contain no physics that inhibit large vortices from forming , so the farthest distance is @xmath22 . however , as we discuss  [ subsec : mach ] , the physics of the compressible gas in ppds will generally limit the size of vortices such that the farthest critical layers do not have @xmath20 .    while the singular eigenmodes are neutrally stable ( do not grow nor decay ) to small perturbations , they are susceptible to being forced and excited by the nearby anticyclone .",
    "it is important to note that although the cartoon makes it appear that the excited critical layers are at the same height as the perturber , they are in fact located somewhat above and below ",
    "the instability is inherently 3d .",
    "a dipolar vortex layer ( two juxtaposed oppositely - signed layers of vorticity ) develops at the location of each critical layers ( panel c ) .",
    "vortex layers that have the same sense of rotation as the background shear are linearly unstable ( panel d ) and roll - up into compact vortices @xcite , and so new anticyclones will eventually be spawned at the locations of the critical layers with @xmath12 vortices at the @xmath24 critical layer ( panel e ) .",
    "the newly spawned vortices from the different critical layers tend to merge into one larger vortex with that vortex located at the critical layer location farthest from the source ( generally with @xmath20 at a distance @xmath22 ) .",
    "the newly created large vortex then excites its neighboring critical layers ( panel f ) and the process continues . in numerical simulations",
    ", one can observe perturbations spawning new vortices farther and farther from the original perturbation vortex .",
    "we named the instability the zombie vortex instability not only because it occurs in the dead zones of ppd , but also because of the way one zombie vortex `` infects '' its neighboring critical layer , spawning new zombie vortices , which `` infect '' their neighboring critical layers , etc . in numerical simulations",
    ", one can see the entire domain rapidly fill with zombie vortices from one initial vortex .",
    "the instability is not an artifact of the numerical method as we have observed it with spectral codes and finite - volume codes ( e.g. ,  _ athena _ ) , with fully compressible , anelastic and boussinesq treatments of the continuity condition , with and without the shearing box , and with either hyperviscosity or real molecular viscosity .",
    "one may ask , if it is so robust , how was it missed in previous numerical calculations ? as will be elucidated in this series of papers , zvi requires vertical stratification , high resolution to resolve the narrow critical layers , a broad spectrum of perturbations ( i.e. ,  kolmogorov , but not gaussian - peaked ) , and enough simulation time to allow the critical layers to amplify perturbations .      in this paper",
    ", we consider zvi in the astrophysical context , rather than the boussinesq approximation appropriate to laboratory couette flow as we did in mpjh13 . in ",
    "[ sec : equations ] , we review the hydrodynamic equations of motion and outline the parameter space of interest for zvi . because the primary tuning parameter for zvi is the brunt - visl frequency @xmath25 , we shall replace linear gravity with a spatially constant value so that @xmath14 itself is also constant ( for vertically isothermal backgrounds ) .",
    "our previous numerical experiments ( including those in bm05 ) show that zvi is present even when @xmath25 is spatially varying .",
    "however , those experiments also convinced us that dealing with a constant @xmath14 makes it much easier to interpret the results and provide a pedagogical explanation for them . in ",
    "[ sec : evidence ] , we shall study zvi and its development into turbulence .",
    "we shall also investigate triggers of zvi other than an initial vortex ( which was used as the initial condition in bm05 and mpjh13 ) , namely initial isotropic , homogeneous kolmogorov - like noise .",
    "we shall characterize properties of zombie turbulence : its magnitude , its space - filling nature , and its inhomogeneity and anisotropy due to persistent , but turbulent , large anticyclonic vortices and undulating cyclonic vortex layers .",
    "most of our numerical experiments presented here use the anelastic approximation ( which filters acoustic waves ) with our pseudo - spectral code that has specially tailored algorithms to handle shear , rotation and stratification @xcite .",
    "we have also done simulations with the fully compressible , godunov finite - volume code _",
    "@xcite , and show that qualitatively and quantitatively we observe similar results .",
    "however , our timing tests show that _ athena _ is approximately 100 times more computationally expensive for these numerical experiments when using the same number of grid points as spectral modes in the pseudo - spectral code .    in our discussion in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we explain why zvi was not observed in previous studies by others , we review zvi in the context of other hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic instabilities in ppds , and we consider the role of zvi in angular momentum transport and planetesimal formation . in a future paper , we will confront zvi on a more mathematical and theoretical level and address thresholds required to trigger zvi . in particular , we will show why extraordinarily weak kolmogorov - like noise is so efficient in exciting zvi .",

    "the basic idea is that there may be large variations in the background pressure and density in hydrostatic equilibrium , but that at any height in the atmosphere , the fluctuations of the pressure and density are small compared to the background values at that height .",
    "mathematically , all flow variables are expanded in powers of the mach number ( presumed to be small ) , and only lowest order terms are retained in the equations of motion . in general , the anelastic approximation results in a valid description of the flow when :    [ e : anelastic_validity ] @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the local sound speed .",
    "diagnostically , it is trivial to check every step during a numerical calculation whether the conditions ( [ e : anelastic_validity ] ) are satisfied .",

    "the robustness of zvi prompts the question of how it was missed in previous studies .",

    "<S> there is considerable interest in hydrodynamic instabilities in dead zones of protoplanetary disks as a mechanism for driving angular momentum transport and as a source of particle - trapping vortices to mix chondrules and incubate planetesimal formation . </S>",
    "<S> we present simulations with a pseudo - spectral anelastic code and with the compressible code _ </S>",
    "<S> athena _ , showing that _ stably stratified _ flows in a shearing , rotating box are violently unstable and produce space - filling , sustained turbulence dominated by large vortices with rossby numbers of order @xmath0@xmath1 . this _ zombie vortex instability _ ( zvi ) is observed in both codes and is triggered by kolmogorov turbulence with mach numbers less than @xmath0@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> it is a common view that if a given constant density flow is stable , then stable vertical stratification should make the flow even more stable . </S>",
    "<S> yet , we show that sufficient vertical stratification can be unstable to zvi . </S>",
    "<S> zvi is robust and requires no special tuning of boundary conditions , or initial radial entropy or vortensity gradients ( though we have studied zvi only in the limit of infinite cooling time ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resolution of this paradox is that stable stratification allows for a new avenue to instability : baroclinic critical layers . </S>",
    "<S> zvi has not been seen in previous studies of flows in rotating , shearing boxes because those calculations frequently lacked vertical density stratification and/or sufficient numerical resolution . </S>",
    "<S> although we do not expect appreciable angular momentum transport from zvi in the small domains in this study , we hypothesize that zvi in larger domains with compressible equations may lead to angular transport via spiral density waves . </S>"
