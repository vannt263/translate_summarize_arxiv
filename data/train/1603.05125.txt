    "all planets in the solar system except mercury and venus have satellites ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "satellites are subject to many types of perturbations , for instance , solar forcing and the oblateness of the host planet",

    "* ) @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the longitude of pericentre of the satellite , @xmath11 the gravitational constant ; @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the solar mass and semimajor axis of the sun s relative motion with respect to the planet ; @xmath14 is the satellite s mean motion and @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 is the mass of the host planet and @xmath17 the semimajor axis of the satellite ) . on the other hand",
    ", the oblateness of the host planet also causes the orbit to precess at the rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a measure of the oblateness and @xmath20 is the equatorial radius of the planet . equating the two , we find the critical semimajor axis @xmath21 for a satellite with @xmath17 below this value",
    ", its orbital evolution is mainly controlled by the planetary oblateness , while one with @xmath17 above this value is governed by solar perturbations .",
    "based on this , @xcite defined irregular satellites as those whose orbital evolution is dominated by the sun , i.e. , with @xmath22 ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "thus inherently , this definition mostly places constraints on the average distance from the satellite to the host planet .",
    "apart from the size , their orbits are often highly eccentric and inclined compared to the regular satellites .",
    "the eccentricity and inclination of the irregulars are generally high and their distribution in @xmath23 and @xmath24 is not uniform ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for example , the inclinations of them are far from @xmath25",
    ". this feature can be explained by kozai - lidov dynamics @xcite that involves the secular perturbation from the sun . under solar forcing ,",
    "the eccentricity and inclination of the satellite are coupled in such a way that the vertical angular momentum @xmath26 is conserved while the eccentricity @xmath27 and inclination @xmath28 of the satellite may experience large - amplitude oscillations , especially when @xmath28 is high .",
    "this mechanism causes the absence of satellites with inclinations around @xmath25 @xcite . we will discuss this effect in detail in sect .",
    "[ semi - sec - total ] .",
    "most irregular satellites reside on retrograde , rather than prograde , orbits ; this relates to the so - called evection phenomenon @xcite .",
    "evection is linked to the mean motion of the sun .",
    "if a satellite is too far from the planet , it will be so perturbed by the sun that its longitude of pericentre @xmath10 precesses at a rate comparable to the solar mean motion . in this case",
    ", the angle @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 is the mean longitude of sun ) may librate ; the angular momentum @xmath31 may oscillate strongly and the eccentricity may grow from @xmath32 to 0.6 @xcite . thus the evection effect places constraints on the stability of irregular satellites and influences their orbital distribution .",
    "furthermore , this effect is not symmetrical with respect to the inclination of @xmath25 because for prograde orbits , @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 is the longitude of the ascending node and @xmath35 the argument of pericentre ) while for retrograde orbits , @xmath10 is the difference of the two angles . as a result",
    ", the eccentricity of a prograde orbit is excited more efficiently than a retrograde one , providing a possible mechanism to explain why the retrograde regime harbours more irregular satellites @xcite .",
    "a prominent feature of the irregular satellite population is that they form groups or families @xcite .",
    "members of the same family have similar orbital elements .",
    "families are thought to be the products of collisional evolution .",
    "@xcite used the gauss equations to infer the degree of dispersion within different groups of irregular satellites .",
    "they found that the himalia family is more widely dispersed than expected for a group of collisional fragments . @xcite and @xcite developed a high order analytical method and used it to calculate accurate precession rates of irregular satellites and to study the dynamical structure of the kozai resonance . based on this method ,",
    "they determined the locations of secular resonances and compared them with the positions of known irregular satellites ; also , a new family around pasiphae was identified .",
    "@xcite applied the megno technique to jovian irregular satellites and identified chaotic and quasi - periodic regions ; they also found some high - order mean motion resonances .",
    "using similar methods , @xcite reported a number of resonances related to the great inequality and revealed the chaotic diffusion in different irregular satellite groups .",
    "all of the above work has assumed the irregular satellites to be massless .",
    "however , in a manner similar to asteroid families ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) a massive member of a satellite family could exert strong perturbations on the smaller members and scatter their orbits ; @xcite found that , gravitational scattering by himalia operating over the age of the solar system could be responsible for the large velocity dispersion observed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite used this effect to place constraints on the mass of himalia .",
    "he also observed a transient resonant lock between the nodes of himalia and lysithea , another satellite in the family .",
    "thus we suppose a massive member could have significant effects on the orbital evolution of the group and this phenomenon needs further study . here , as a case study , we focus our attention on the himalia group of jupiter and particularly on the resonances identified by @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in sect .",
    "[ nodal - intro - sec ] , we introduce the himalia group , the phenomenon of `` nodal libration '' and the model used to study it . then in sect .",
    "[ semi - sec - total ] , we describe our semianalytical approach to model the nodal libration and introduce other resonant phenomena .",
    "the results of @xmath1-body simulations are presented in sect .",
    "[ sec - n - body ] .",
    "finally , sect .",
    "[ sec - discussion ] is devoted to the conclusions and discussions .",
    "the himalia group is a prograde jovian irregular satellite group with five members : himalia , elara , lysithea , leda and dia .",
    "himalia is the largest member that carries the group name ; it is at least 8 times more massive than any of the other four known members . ] .",
    "@xcite studied the perturbation of himalia on other satellites and estimated the mass to be @xmath36 km@xmath37/s@xmath38 , consistent with the estimate of @xcite based on its scattering effect .",
    "we adopt this mass estimate throughout the paper .",
    "the mean semimajor axis , eccentricity and inclination of the group are 0.078 au , 0.18 and 28@xmath39 , respectively .    in @xcite , where the main purpose was to study the influence of gravitational scattering within the himalia group ,",
    "the effects of the sun , saturn and jovian oblateness ( corrected for the additional mass of galilean satellites ) were considered ; himalia and elara were assumed to be massive and other family members were massless .",
    "in such a configuration , it was found that the difference between the longitudes of the nodes of lysithea and himalia @xmath40 could occasionally librate around @xmath41 on a timescale of 1 myr with the amplitude of the oscillation in inclination being @xmath42 ( see figs . 4 and 5 of that work ) .",
    "@xcite also reported that , on entering and leaving the libration , significant changes in the inclination can occur .",
    "this provides a fast channel for the evolution of inclination and may contribute to the large relative velocity dispersion in the himalia group .",
    "we refer to this phenomenon as `` nodal resonance '' or `` nodal libration '' hereafter .",
    "here , our goal is to specifically study this dynamical phenomenon .",
    "to isolate the relevant dynamics , we work within a restricted four - body problem model containing jupiter , the sun , a massive himalia and a massless test particle ; see fig [ model - illustration ] . here",
    ", all bodies revolve around jupiter ( in the relative sense ) .",
    "the sun is assumed to be on a circular orbit .        in the following sections , we tackle this four - body problem with both semianalytical and fully numerical methods .",
    "our strategy is to split the four - body problem of jupiter - sun - himalia - particle into two restricted three - body problems that can be tackled separately using perturbation analysis .",
    "the first includes jupiter , the sun and himalia . since the mass of himalia is vanishingly small compared with those of jupiter and the sun , it is assumed to be also massless in this part .",
    "thus himalia and the particle can be studied using the same technique .",
    "the second three - body problem is comprised of jupiter , massive himalia and the massless particle .",
    "we describe in detail the methods dealing with the two restricted three - body problems in the following subsections .",
    "then we explain how we combine the two .    in this paper",
    ", we use a normalised unit system in which the solar mass is 1 ; jovian semimajor axis is 1 ; gravitational constant is 1 ; thus the orbital period of jupiter is approximately @xmath43 ; in practice , we have used @xmath43 in time conversion for the @xmath1-body simulations described in sect .",
    "[ sec - n - body ] .      in the first instance",
    ", solar perturbations dominate the evolution of himalia and the particle .",
    "a substantial body of literature has dealt with such `` hierarchical '' planet - sun - satellite problems and has discussed the kozai - lidov mechanism @xcite .",
    "there , the hamiltonian of the system is expanded in terms of the ratio of semimajor axis of the satellite to that of the sun ( we denote this ratio as @xmath44 hereafter ) and only the leading order terms ( of order @xmath45 ; the `` quadrupole '' hamiltonian ) are retained .",
    "actually , in our simple model , the sun has zero eccentricity , causing the octupole hamiltonian ( of order @xmath46 ) to be zero ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "then the mean anomalies of the sun and himalia are eliminated .",
    "owing to a `` happy coincidence '' @xcite , the quadrupole secular hamiltonian is integrable .",

    "the hamiltonian @xmath48 and semimajor axis @xmath17 are conserved . as the longitude of the ascending node @xmath34 does not appear in eq .",
    ", the vertical component of the angular momentum @xmath49 is constant as well . for a dynamical system governed by this hamiltonian",
    ", @xmath35 may librate around @xmath50 while the angular momentum @xmath51 may experience large amplitude oscillation , giving rise to the kozai resonance .",
    "all four giant planets have such satellites @xcite .",
    "the libration in @xmath35 requires the inclination to exceed @xmath52 ; this is not the situation for the himalia group .",
    "generally , such evolution under solar perturbation is referred to as a `` kozai cycle '' . in kozai",
    "theory , the reference plane is the orbital plane of jupiter ; this frame is used throughout the paper .    with this hamiltonian",
    ", we can obtain the expressions for the nodal and apsidal precession rates of the satellite .",
    "the hamiltonian will be further simplified in subsect .",
    "[ sec - analytical ] .      here , we consider the subsystem comprised of jupiter , himalia and a massless test particle",
    ".    since the orbits of the two satellites are close and may cross , the traditional expansion of the disturbing function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is not applicable here . to tackle this , we resort to treating the problem under the framework of coorbital theory . the crucial differences between coorbital theory and the conventional treatment lie in the expansion in the disturbing function and in the elimination of the mean anomalies . in coorbital theory ,",
    "no expansion is made with respect to the ratio of semimajor axes .",
    "the mean anomalies of the two orbits are eliminated in a combined manner so that the difference in the mean longitudes @xmath53 remains .",
    "this enables the study of the variation of the relative semimajor axis @xmath54 ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when studying the secular evolution of the system , @xmath53 is eliminated .",
    "we follow @xcite ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and use the relative quantities , e.g. , the relative vector eccentricity @xmath55 ( where @xmath10 is the longitude of pericentre ) of the particle relative to himalia .",
    "we assume that himalia and the particle are on similar orbits ( i.e. , with similar semimajor axes , eccentricities and inclinations ) , that their eccentricities and inclinations are much smaller than unity and that their total mass is far smaller than that of the central body , jupiter .",
    "the semimajor axes , eccentricities and inclinations of the members of the group are restricted to small ranges and the eccentricities are relatively small , satisfying the requirement of coorbital theory .",
    "however , the inclination of the himalia group is about 0.5 rad . as the main purpose of this section is to describe the dynamical structure qualitatively but not to provide a precise quantitative description of the orbital evolution , we divide all inclinations by a factor of 3 in this section wherever coorbital theory is involved . in this way , the eccentricities and inclinations are all around 0.17 , better suiting the expansion described below .",
    "we will briefly discuss what the situation is if we apply the original inclinations in sect .",
    "[ sec - discussion ] . in this",
    "setting , the motion of the two satellites can be expressed in a frame whose origin revolves around jupiter on a circular orbit of semimajor axis @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) ; the frame also rotates along its @xmath58-axis at an angular velocity of @xmath59 ( where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are masses of jupiter and himalia , respectively ; the particle is massless ) . omitting higher order terms in @xmath27 and @xmath28 and assuming that the two satellites are not generally interacting",
    ", the cartesian coordinates of himalia in this rotating frame can be expressed as the following functions of time @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the regular orbital elements of himalia ; similar equations apply for the particle . from the linearity of these expressions , it can be seen that analogous expressions exist for the motion of the particle relative to himalia and the relative @xmath27 and @xmath28 are constant .",
    "on account of a massive himalia , the relative eccentricity and inclination begin to evolve .",
    "it has been shown the secular evolution of relative @xmath27 and @xmath28 observe the following potential @xcite @xmath69 where when @xmath70 , @xmath71 and when @xmath72 , @xmath73 in the above expressions , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( the relative elements ) .",
    "the equations of motion are then @xcite @xmath85    the coorbital secular potential causes variations in @xmath86 and @xmath87 ; it also gives rise to precession in @xmath88 and @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "these effects , in turn , are reflected in the evolution of the particle s elements @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "having isolated the relevant dynamics in the two sub - problems discussed in subsects .",
    "[ sec - solar ] and [ sec - coorbital ] , we now want to combine them .",
    "this is done so that both himalia and the test particle experience solar perturbation through the kozai hamiltonian ; to this we add the gravitational influence on the particle from himalia by applying to potential and adding the corresponding variation rates to the particle .",
    "thus the equations of motion are @xmath92 where @xmath93 is an arbitrary orbital element ; @xmath94 refers to the solar perturbation and is a function of the elements of himalia or the particle ; @xmath95 represents the contribution from the coorbital interaction potential and is a function of the relative elements .",
    "we now have an eight - dimensional system of @xmath96 .",
    "the evolution of the particle is generally dominated by solar perturbations even when perturbations by both the sun and himalia are considered .",
    "we use a simple example to demonstrate this point . according to eqs . and , and for the nominal orbits of himalia and lysithea ( as the particle ) , the timescales of precession in @xmath97 and @xmath98 induced by the coorbital potential are @xmath99 and @xmath100",
    ". for solar perturbations , the corresponding timescales are @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "noting that , according to @xcite , the timescale of nodal libration is @xmath103 , thus the effects of a kozai cycle should be considered as `` fast '' and can be eliminated when tackling nodal libration .",
    "assuming that within a kozai cycle , changes in eccentricity is small ( @xmath104 ) and applying some algebraic manipulations ( see appendix [ sec - kozai - derivation ] for details ) , we have the following `` averaged '' kozai hamiltonian @xmath105 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the `` averaged '' quantities over a kozai cycle compared to the original ones in eq . .",
    "with this hamiltonian , the precession rates of @xmath34 and @xmath10 are constant . rates of group members are close with similar @xmath17 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    as shown above , the influence of himalia is several orders of magnitude smaller than that of the sun .",
    "we suggest that , the libration in @xmath0 is only possible where @xmath106 is vanishingly small under solar perturbations . with the hamiltonian",
    ", we define a surface in @xmath6 space where all points on it share the same nodal precession rate with himalia : @xmath107 ( since @xmath108 is a function depending only on @xmath17 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) ; we call this a surface of equal precession rate ( sepr ) in @xmath34 .",
    "we show the sepr in fig .",
    "[ equal - precession - hh ] ; it is conceptually similar to those discussed in @xcite in the contact of secular resonances in the main asteroid belt .",
    "note that , until now , we do not assume small eccentricity or inclination for the kozai hamiltonian ; thus the sepr applies to the real himalia group , whose inclination is about 0.5 rad .     in @xmath6 space .",
    "the location of the surface is calculated using the kozai hamiltonian without expansion in eccentricity or inclination .",
    "points on the surface share the same precession rate as himalia in @xmath109 .",
    "the black square represents the location of himalia , scaledwidth=80.0% ]    however , as the coorbital potential results from an expansion in eccentricity and inclination , combining it with the full expression for the kozai potential seems superfluous .",
    "hence , we also expand in @xmath27 and @xmath28 , retaining terms up to order four to arrive at the following kozai hamiltonian @xmath110 we then rewrite the hamiltonian in normalised poincar conjugate variables , and again we adopt expansions in @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the variables are @xmath111 under the new variable set , the kozai hamiltonian becomes @xmath112 since now the variables are the normalised angular momenta , we introduce a factor of @xmath113 into the coefficient of to preserve the hamiltonian property . to better separate `` slow '' and `` fast '' angles ,",
    "we apply the following canonical transformation : @xmath114 on the right - hand side of the above expressions , @xmath115 and @xmath116 are conjugate normalised poincar variables with subscripts `` h '' and `` p '' referring to himalia and the particle , respectively . on the left - hand side , angles ( represented with lower - cased letters ) with subscript `` f '' are faster compared to those with subscript `` s '' , since the former are differences between , while the latter are identical to , the original angles ; the conjugate momenta are represented with capital letters .",
    "thus the kozai hamiltonian of both himalia and the particle assumes the following form @xmath117 with coefficients @xmath118 and @xmath119 , where @xmath63 and @xmath120 are the semimajor axes of himalia and the test particle , respectively .",
    "the coorbital potential is a branch function .",
    "note that within the satellite group , the quantity @xmath75 is always small .",
    "taking the orbital elements of lysithea for example , @xmath121 while @xmath122 is of order @xmath123 .",
    "thus the condition @xmath124 is rarely satisfied and the potential form dominates .",
    "we omit the other form and presume that the potential only takes this form .",
    "again , we emphasise that , what matters is the difference between the nodes of the particle and himalia . hence , any effects that operate on timescales comparable to @xmath125 are considered `` fast '' ( cf .",
    "transformation ) and we need to eliminate them . since we have assumed constant eccentricity and inclination in the kozai theory and , there is nothing to remove in the kozai hamiltonian .",
    "however , the short timescale effects in the coorbital potential need elimination .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "first , we substitute the variables in the coorbital potential to express it in the same variables as the kozai hamiltonian . noting that the fast angles are controlled primarily by the kozai potential , they precess evenly with time ( cf .",
    "hence we perform two finite integrations and arrive at the `` slow '' coorbital potential and @xmath126 , exchanging @xmath122 and @xmath126 will not alter the value . ] : @xmath127 + \\log e_\\mathrm{r } \\right\\}\\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the variables have the same meaning as in eqs . and ; @xmath128 is the unit imaginary number ; @xmath129 represents the imaginary part ; @xmath130 is the polylogarithm function defined as ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath131 where @xmath58 is a complex number and @xmath132 .",
    "we have now reached a system devoid of `` fast '' effects , i.e. , those operating on timescales similar to a kozai cycle .",
    "note that the coorbital potential is _ not _ a hamiltonian in these variables ( we show this in the appendix [ sec - non - canonical ] ) .",
    "however , we can still write down the equations of motion of the system as @xmath133 here @xmath134 is the rate of solar - driven variation in @xmath135 and is derived directly from partial differentiation of the kozai hamiltonian .",
    "the derivation of the coorbital potential contribution @xmath136 and @xmath137 is not so straightforward . using the potential and the equations of motion",
    ", we can express the variational rates of the relative variables @xmath138 and @xmath139 exerted by himalia .",
    "the rates of the orbital elements of the particle are related to these rates through eq . .",
    "then the transformation allows us to derive the rates @xmath136 and @xmath137 in eq . .",
    "analogous relations exist for @xmath140 and @xmath141 . in this way",
    ", we arrive at the above equations of motion .",
    "in essence , what we have is a four - dimensional system of @xmath142 .",
    "when describing the dynamics of the system , we still use the original orbital elements @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 .      with the equations of motion above , we are able to integrate the system numerically to investigate its evolution . ] .",
    "we run test integrations and find that , at most locations in phase space , the angles @xmath0 and @xmath7 circulate with small amplitude oscillations in @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "this is not unexpected and results from the fact that , for positions in the @xmath6 space far from the sepr , solar perturbations cause @xmath0 and @xmath7 to circulate fast , while the coorbital potential contributes minor changes to the precession rates and introduces small amplitude variations in @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "however , when near the sepr , himalia can be as efficient as the sun in changing the orbital evolution ; we show this in the following subsections .      in fig .",
    "[ hh - example - semi ] , we show an example of nodal libration in @xmath0 in our integrations of eq . . as observed in @xcite , the angle @xmath0 librates around @xmath41 .",
    "while the inclination oscillates in concert with the libration in the nodal difference , the eccentricity undergoes only small amplitude and short time - scale variations .",
    "in fact , the eccentricity is a quasi - conserved quantity here and in the two - dimensional system in subsect .",
    "[ sec - phase - space ] , it is actually constant .",
    "the timescale of nodal libration is of order @xmath147 ( @xmath5 1 myr ) and the changes in inclination are of order @xmath148 . to prove the postulate that the librator oscillates around the sepr when in resonance , we plot the signed distance from the particle to the surface in the same figure . from the plot ,",
    "it is clear that , when above the sepr , @xmath0 increases and vice versa .",
    "inherently , when in nodal libration , the particle is restricted to be near the surface and to cross it regularly .",
    "this also shows the dominance of the sun .",

    "these two factors may cause the failure of the above method to identify these episodes of libration for the three resonances .    to provide a universal approach valid for all the resonances , we introduce the following method which detects libration depending on the behaviour of the angles only .",
    "the basic idea is that principally , when an angle is in libration , it can not cross the point that is @xmath41 away from the libration centre and it must cross the libration centre regularly .",
    "for instance , in the case of nodal libration ( i.e. , when the libration centre is @xmath41 ) , the angle @xmath0 should not cross 0 and it is supposed to cross @xmath41 periodically . if this state of affairs persists , we recognise it as a libration event .",
    "additionally , we require the frequency of crossing the libration centre and the rate of the librating angle to be within plausible ranges .",

    "we have implemented the evection corrections as proposed in @xcite and found that it does not improve the precision of our model significantly . to be exact , with the corrections , we are still unable to approximate the nodal rate accurately enough to locate the position of the sepr ( in the full @xmath1-body model ) . thus the evection correction is dropped .",
    "in addition , though the octupole solar perturbation potential is zero owing to the circular orbit assumed for the sun ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , even higher order terms may contribute to the precession of the node and shift the location of resonance slightly .",
    "regarding our simple way in removing @xmath35 in eq . and in reaching eq . , there are semianalytical methods for this purpose @xcite .",
    "but that approach requires the introduction of new variables that have no apparent physical meaning , which we believe will complicate the interpretation of the results .",
    "our semianalytical model does not reproduce the apsidal resonance in @xmath7 .",
    "the original kozai potential is dependent on @xmath27 only to order 2 but on @xmath28 to higher orders ( through @xmath266 ) while in the coorbital potential ( eqs . and ) , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are symmetric .",
    "thus this shortcoming of the semianalytical model results from the kozai potential , specifically the truncated form of the solar forcing .",
    "the lack of higher order terms in @xmath27 causes the absence of @xmath267 in the final kozai potential while @xmath268 does exist .",
    "thus after partial differentiation , the rate @xmath269 does not depend on its conjugate angular momentum @xmath270 but @xmath271 does depend on @xmath272 .",
    "hence we suggest that , the kozai potential not only gives rise to the seprs , it must also play an important role in modulating @xmath271 ( thus @xmath273 ) through @xmath272 .",
    "therefore , terms like @xmath267 in the solar perturbation is needed for the apsidal libration , which is only possible in higher order terms in @xmath44 .",
    "indeed , if we artificially add a term @xmath274 in the kozai potential , the resonance in @xmath7 can be retrieved in the semianalytical model .",
    "we believe this is why we do not observe apsidal libration in the semianalytical model while it does appear in the @xmath1-body simulations .",
    "this is probably why the apsidal resonance is the most unstable and the weakest ( see figs . [ n - ww ] and [ stability - n ] ) .",
    "although our semianalytical model is truncated in @xmath27 and @xmath28 , we test it with real himalia group inclinations ( @xmath275 ) and find that , the model does reproduce the three resonances at these inclinations . however , by dividing the real inclinations by a factor of 3 , the @xmath27 and @xmath28 are similarly small and more consistent with the assumptions made in deriving the coorbital interaction potential @xcite .",
    "we have simplified the problem to a restricted four - body problem model . in reality , perturbations such as the oblateness of jupiter and the effects of other planets exist . when these additional factors are considered , we suggest these resonances may still persist . in our analysis ,",
    "the solar perturbation mainly arrests relative precession and makes the resonances possible , though terms like @xmath276 do contribute directly to give rise to the resonances . on the timescales we are interested in ,",
    "it has been simplified in the form containing no angles .",
    "when a more elaborate model is constructed , probably similar simplifications can be made and small changes in the resonance locations ( in the form of the seprs ) will likely occur . in @xcite , saturn and the jovian oblateness were taken into account and in such a configuration , he found the resonance in @xmath0 . including other planets may introduce additional dynamical effects such as secular resonances ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similar to high order mean motion resonance @xcite and secular resonance @xcite , resonances involving other combinations of @xmath0 and @xmath7 may exist",
    ". they may be weaker and less stable , compared to the resonances described in this paper .    as shown in figs .",
    "[ equal - precession - all ] and [ elements - resonance ] , the seprs are close together to each other , especially near the massive satellite .",
    "consequently , the resonances may interact with each other and give rise to chaos ; e.g. , fig .",
    "[ n - hpw ] . considering",
    "that himalia may give other group members random kicks during close encounters , it is not strange that a test particle may pass through more than one type of resonance if we extend the @xmath1-body simulations long enough .",
    "actually , in our 100 myr integration , we observe an example transiting from libration in @xmath7 to libration in @xmath4 .    considering that the retrograde irregular satellite groups are more prevalent in the solar system and that , they often have a much more massive member , the resonances explored in this paper for prograde satellites may have their counterparts in the retrograde case .",
    "for example , the ananke and carme groups of jupiter have inclinations around @xmath277 and @xmath278 , respectively .",
    "however , the most massive members in the two groups are only 0.004 and 0.02 of the mass of himalia ( @xmath61 ) and this is possibly too small to allow resonance phenomena to exist . as an experiment",
    ", we have run @xmath1-body simulations to test if a prograde massive satellite of @xmath279 can induce nodal resonance and the results is positive  such low masses may work . as the cases of evection phenomenon ( described in sect .",
    "[ sec - intro ] ) , the definition of @xmath10 becomes the difference between @xmath34 and @xmath35 for retrograde orbits ; it is possible that the structure of the retrograde resonances is different , for instance , the libration centre may change . for",
    "the masses and orbital elements mentioned here , see footnote 1 .",
    "recently , @xcite reported a nodal resonance similar to the one discussed here .",
    "their resonance is due to ceres and could be responsible for the inclination dispersion in the hoffmeister asteroid family . in their case ,",
    "the main perturbation comes from jupiter and the mass ratio between ceres and jupiter is of order @xmath280 ; in our situation , the mass ratio @xmath281 is @xmath190 , arguably a more extreme case . due to the similar nature of the two problems",
    ", we suggest that other types of resonance ( e.g. , the one involving @xmath161 ) may exist in the asteroid belt .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ elements - resonance ] we see that , dia , elara and leda are near the sepr in @xmath282 while lysithea is close to the surface in @xmath34 . to check whether the real satellites could be affected by the resonances",
    ", we perform an additional integration using the orbits of the real moons for 1000 myr .",
    "we find that , leda does enter the resonance in @xmath4 .",

    "we derive the kozai hamiltonian from its original form here . first , we substitute @xmath27 and @xmath28 in eq . in terms of the angular momenta @xmath283 and @xmath284",
    ". then we solve for @xmath283 so @xmath285 , where @xmath286 refers to combinations of @xmath287 , @xmath12 , @xmath17 and @xmath13 .",
    "note that in this expression , @xmath48 , @xmath284 and @xmath286 are all constant and only @xmath35 and @xmath283 are variable .",
    "furthermore , it can be shown with this equation that the variation in eccentricity during a kozai cycle , @xmath288 is a small quantity ( e.g. , for himalia s nominal orbit , @xmath289 ) .",
    "therefore , we assume that the angular momentum @xmath290 can be expressed as @xmath291 where the coefficients @xmath292",
    ". we can then express @xmath293 and @xmath294 as functions of @xmath48 , @xmath284 and @xmath286 by comparing the above equation with @xmath285 .",
    "now , if we further omit the term @xmath295 we have @xmath296 here , @xmath297 is not the @xmath27 in the original hamiltonian but the averaged @xmath27 over a kozai cycle .",

    "we arrive at the `` averaged '' kozai hamiltonian .",
    "the new eccentricity and inclination are constant under the solar forcing ; for simplicity , we still use the old notations @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "as stated in subsect . [ sec - analytical ] , the coorbital potential ( and hence ) is not canonical in the variables used in eq . .",
    "to prove this , we presume it is canonical and introduce the following canonical transformations . for the first transformation , we name the variables on the left side as `` absolute cartesian '' variables .",
    "@xmath301 on the right - hand sides of the above expressions , @xmath115 and @xmath116 are conjugate poincar variables with subscripts `` h '' and `` p '' referring to himalia and a particle , respectively .",
    "then another transformation is introduced .",
    "the variables on the left are referred to as `` relative cartesian '' variables .",
    "@xmath302 this relates the variables with subscript `` r '' to the variables used in the coorbital theory as given by @xcite ; see the paragraph containing eqs . - .",
    "now note that , since we assume the coorbital potential is canonical in the original poincar variables , it should preserve the hamiltonian property in the variables above .",
    "since the coorbital potential contains only the relative elements , i.e. , in the relative cartesian variables , it only depends on the variables with subscript `` r '' .",
    "hence , if we consider the jupiter - himalia - particle system . the quantities with subscript `` t '' will be conserved .",
    "however , this is not possible .",
    "taking @xmath303 for instance .",
    "since the test particle is massless , it should have no influence on himalia and thus the second term on the right hand side @xmath304 is constant . from the above reasoning , we know that , @xmath305 should be conserved .",
    "this means that , the first term on the right hand side , @xmath306 will no change .",
    "similarly , @xmath307 , @xmath308 and @xmath309 should all be constant .",
    "if so , the orbital elements of the particle are not evolving under the perturbation of himalia .",
    "of course this is not true ",
    "the coorbital potential is not a hamiltonian in the variables used here .",
    "however , the level - curve like structure in the phase diagrams figs . [ phase - nodal ] , [ phase - wmh ] and [ phase - hpw ] of the three types of resonance suggests the existence of a conserved quantity ( a hamiltonian ) for these two - dimensional systems . we have tried to construct one of the form of @xmath310 ( see eqs . and ) , where @xmath215 is a constant depending on some non - changing parameters .",
    "for instance , for the case of nodal resonance , @xmath215 could be a function of the masses , the semimajor axes and the eccentricities ( but not a function of inclinations ) .",
    "however , the solution for @xmath215 seems to be nonexistent ( at least for the nodal resonance ) .",
