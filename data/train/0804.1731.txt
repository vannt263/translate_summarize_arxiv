    "ultra - cool dwarfs are very red objects with spectral subtype m7.0 or later .",
    "the class includes very low mass stars , with masses just above the hydrogen - burning limit , and extends into the substellar ( brown dwarf ) regime .",
    "while ultra - cool dwarfs are expected to be common , their low luminosities make them very challenging objects to find and study , outside of the immediate vicinity of the sun .",
    "the census of spectroscopically confirmed ultra - cool dwarfs remains quite small compared with the very large numbers of low - mass stars now formally classified as m0-m6 dwarfs @xcite .",
    "ultra - cool _ subdwarfs _ are the metal - poor analogs of the ultra - cool dwarfs .",
    "while representatives of the latter group have been known for some time @xcite , it is only recently that ultra - cool subdwarfs have been spectroscopically identified . in the solar vicinity , ultra - cool subdwarfs",
    "are kinematically associated with the galactic halo @xcite , and represent the low - mass end of the local population ii . as such",
    ", their local density is quite low , which explains their scarcity in the solar vicinity .",
    "dwarfs and subdwarfs of spectral type m have optical spectra dominated by molecular bands of metal hydrides ( cah , feh ) and metal oxides ( tio , vo ) . under the classification system recently proposed by @xcite , that expands the system of @xcite , main sequence m stars are segregated into four `` metallicity classes . ''",
    "these are assigned on the basis of the relative strength of oxide and hydride bands , which dominate the optical - red spectrum and whose ratio is believed to be a function of log z @xcite .",
    "solar metallicity objects are classified as dwarfs ( m , or dm ) , while the more metal - poor stars are classified as subdwarfs ( sdm ) , extreme subdwarfs ( esdm ) , and ultra subdwarfs ( usdm ) , in order of decreasing metallicity . at the turn of the century",
    ", only two ultra - cool subdwarfs were known : the sdm7.0 subdwarf lhs 377 @xcite , and the esdm7.0 extreme subdwarf apmpm j0559 - 2903 @xcite . since then",
    ", a dozen more objects have been discovered , spanning the spectral type range sdm7.0-sdm9.5 , esdm7.0-esdm8.5 , and usdm7.0-usdm7.5 @xcite .",
    "in addition , metal - poor stars have also been found into the l spectral type regime @xcite .",
    "these objects are clearly substellar in nature , and believed to be population ii brown dwarfs . a case in contention",
    "is the star lsr j1610 - 0040 , initially classified as an sdl @xcite , but which may be a peculiar sdm @xcite .",
    "one thing is clear at this time : the census of local ultracool subdwarfs is largely incomplete , and our knowledge fragmentary . much more extensive samples are required , which would be critical in constraining the low end of the galactic halo mass function , and understanding the properties of cool , metal - poor atmospheres .",
    "this letter reports the discovery of 23 new ultracool subdwarfs from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) spectroscopic database .",
    "this more than doubles the current census of spectroscopically confirmed ultracool subdwarfs , and suggests a simple method for the identification of more such stars .",
    "the search and identification is described in  2 , where the spectra are also presented .",
    "colors and reduced proper motions are analyzed in  3 .",
    "results are discussed in  4 .",

    "each spectrum was automatically matched against a grid of composite spectra of m dwarfs and subdwarfs assembled by lpine ( 2008 , in preparation ) .",
    "this grid , built on the 4-class metallicity system of @xcite , includes reference spectra for m stars of all four metallicity subclasses ( dm , sdm , esdm , usdm ) , covering all known spectral subtypes with a 0.5-subtype resolution .",
    "the new grid expands and complements the m dwarf classification templates assembled by @xcite .",
    "spectral classes and subtypes are assigned on the basis of a least - squares fit over the full 6100 - 7900spectral range .",
    "this improves on the standard classification scheme for m subdwarfs , which is based on the absolute and relative strengths of the three line indices cah2 , cah3 , and tio5 @xcite .",
    "the main problem with those molecular line indices is that they are defined over relatively narrow spectral ranges , making them unreliable in low signal - to - noise spectra .",
    "a fit over a much broader spectral region made it possible to classify sdss spectra from very faint sources , with a signal - to - noise ratio per resolution element as low as s / n@xmath4 .",
    "since the classification grid is built from a combination of those same sdss spectra , several iterations were made on which the grid was modified , and vetted against the spectral - index classification system .",

    "all except one ( sdss j1351 + 5506 ) are fainter than any of the previously known ultra - cool m subdwarfs ; 15 of them are even too faint to show up in 2mass .",
    "proper motions were found in the sdss catalog for only a few stars .",
    "we instead determined the proper motions for all the stars from their photographic plate counterparts , as found in the supercosmos sky survey @xcite and the apm - north catalogue @xcite .",

    "a subsample of 50,000 random sdss point sources is also displayed ( _ dots _ ) .",
    "the ultra - cool subdwarfs are found to stand out significantly from the locus of the field stars , confirming the trend observed for earlier m subdwarfs by @xcite .",
    "stars are also segregated by metallicity subclass , with the sdm having larger @xmath7 colors and usdm smaller @xmath7 values .",
    "the trend suggests that at lower metallicities , cool stars tend to fall more in line with the extrapolated color - color sequence of the more massive stars ( _ dashed line _ ) , consistent with a spectral energy distribution more similar to that of a blackbody",
    ".    stars for which proper motions are available all have @xmath8 mas yr@xmath9 , which suggests that they are either high - velocity objects and/or have very low luminosities .",
    "the right panel in figure 2 shows the [ @xmath0,@xmath1 reduced proper motion diagram for all the sdss ultra - cool subdwarfs with recorded @xmath10 .",
    "the objects are all located along the extension of the population ii sequence @xcite , which runs between the population i sequence ( _ upper right _ ) and the white dwarf sequence ( _ lower left _ ) .",
    "this unambiguously demonstrates that the stars are low - mass objects at the bottom of the main sequence and kinematically associated with the galactic halo population .",
    "the very distinctive distribution of colors and reduced proper motions suggests an efficient method to identify ultra - cool subdwarfs .",
    "they should be found among stellar sources with @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "additional proper motion or reduced proper motion constraints would optimally select for those low - luminosity objects , with minimal background contamination .",
    "this would work best at high galactic latitudes , where interstellar reddening is minimal .",
    "our successful search for ultra - cool subdwarfs demonstrates that these stars can be identified in deep optical surveys like sdss .",
    "the stars stand out in the ( g - r , r - i ) color - color diagram , their locus clearly distinct from that of solar - metallicity objects .",
    "this makes them easy to identify from point sources in fields imaged in the sdss _ ugriz _ color system .",
    "it is expected that ultra - cool subdwarfs will be easy to identify in future , deep imaging surveys , provided they use similar _ gri _ bandpasses .",
    "the fact that ultra - cool subdwarfs are segregated by metallicity in color - color space also makes them highly valuable tracers of galactic halo structure and history .    in color - color space , the ultracool subdwarfs populate a region typically occupied by extra - galactic objects such as qsos @xcite",
    "indeed , all 23 new ultra - cool subdwarfs presented in this letter were qso targets in the sdss spectroscopic survey .",
    "interestingly , this is not the first time that ultra - cool stars are discovered as a by - product of qso surveys ; ultra - cool dwarfs were also identified in early surveys of high - redshift quasars @xcite . but just like subdwarfs are a contaminant for qso surveys , qsos would also be a common contaminant of subdwarf surveys .",
    "absolute proper motion cuts would be necessary to limit the contamination from extragalactic sources .",
    "it is fortunate that subdwarfs are kinematically associated with the local galactic halo population and tend to be high - velocity stars in the vicinity of the sun .",
    "a combination of color cuts and minimal proper motion requirement would be the most efficient technique to select ultra - cool subdwarfs .    in the meantime",
    ", the spectra collected here will be used to further refine the classification templates , and assist in the identification and classification of ultra - cool subdwarfs in upcoming sdss data releases . the subdwarf classification",
