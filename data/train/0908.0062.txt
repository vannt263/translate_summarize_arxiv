    "this allows for calculations that treat the nucleus as a collection of hard objects in an average or mean field to describe many of the properties of nuclear matter ; however , this simple picture breaks down when detailed features are studied .",
    "in particular , the short - distance part of the nucleon - nucleon potential can cause central , tensor and spin - orbit correlations between the nucleons in nuclei which deplete the low momentum states in nuclear systems  @xcite .",
    "calculations indicate that these short - range correlations can lead to short - term local densities in the nucleus that are several times as high as the average nuclear density of 0.17  gev/@xmath3 ; and thus , comparable to densities predicted in neutron stars  @xcite .",

    "but most of all , our thanks goes to the people who received their ph.d.s doing the research presented herein and without whom these exciting new results would not have been possible . in hall  a , thank to nilanga liyanage for his work on the e89 - 003 @xmath59o@xmath1 experiment ; to fatiha benmokhtar and marat rvachev for their work on the e89 - 044 @xmath26he@xmath1 experiment ; and to peter monaghan , ran shneor , and ramesh subedi for their work on the e01 - 015 @xmath112 experiment . in hall  b , thanks to natalia dashyan for her work on the clas ( e , e ) analysis and rustam niyazov for his work on the clas @xmath32he(e , epp)n analysis . in hall c , thanks to ben clasie , dipangkar dutta , dave mckee , kristoff normand , daniela rohe , and derek van westrum for their work on nuclear transparency and spectral function measurements . and finally , we remember our deceased friend kim eyigan , who shorty before his death , found the signatures for short - range correlations that he had spent his life searching for .",

    "<S> in particular , to understand what happens when two or more nucleons within a nucleus have strongly overlapping wave - functions ; a phenomena commonly referred to as short - range correlations . </S>",
    "<S> herein , we review the results of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 reactions that have been used at jefferson lab to probe this short - distance structure as well as provide an outlook for future experiments . </S>"
