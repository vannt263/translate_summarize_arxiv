    "first models of the stellar / solar wind ( sw ) interaction with the interstellar medium ( ism ) were developed by @xcite .",

    "the structure of the interaction in the latter model has three discontinuities ( fig .",
    "[ astrosphere_sketches]a ) : 1 ) the termination shock ( ts ) that decelerates the stellar wind from supersonic to subsonic , 2 ) the heliopause / astropause that is a tangential discontinuity ( td ) separating the stellar wind flow from the interstellar medium , 3 ) the bow shock ( bs ) that decelerates the supersonic interstellar flow from the supersonic regime to the subsonic one . if the interstellar flow is subsonic or subalfvnic in mhd case then the bow shock maybe absent e.g. ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . during last @xmath145 years",
    "the models of sw / ism have been significantly developed .",
    "modern models are three dimensional and time dependent , they take into account the multi - component nature of both sw and ism , the effects of magnetic fields , interstellar neutrals , energetic particles . for details ,",
    "see , for example , reviews and papers by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "what is common in all modern models is the sheet - like topology of the heliopause ( see  fig .",
    "[ astrosphere_sketches]a ) .    in 2015",
    "@xcite and @xcite have shown that the heliopause may in fact have a tube - like shape ( fig .",
    "[ astrosphere_sketches]b ) .",
    "@xcite have obtained such a shape in their numerical 3d mhd code for the case when the interstellar gas flows with respect to the star . later",
    "this result has been discussed by @xcite and @xcite and needs to be explored further .",
    "@xcite has considered a simpler case , when the solar wind flows into the homogeneous interstellar gas at rest .",
    "this case is quite identical to one of @xcite .",
    "the only difference is in the heliospheric magnetic field that has not been taken into account by parker . to understand the effects of the stellar ( heliospheric ) magnetic field qualitatively ,",
    "let us start with @xcite model .",
    "there is a shock transition in his solution ( i.e. the termination shock ) at @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the heliocentric distance to the termination shock , @xmath4 is the stellar mass loss rate , @xmath5 is the terminal velocity of the supersonic stellar wind , @xmath6 is the interstellar gas pressure . in the supersonic sw ( for @xmath7 ) the solution is @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the distance to the sun or star . in the subsonic region ( @xmath12 )",
    "the gas may be considered incompressible and the solution is @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this solution can be used to calculate the frozen - in magnetic field in the kinematic approximation . solving @xmath16=0",
    "$ ] and assuming that magnetic field is parallel to the velocity vector at the sun : @xmath17 @xcite ; @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the angle counted from the stellar rotational axis , @xmath20 is the azimuthal angle .    in the subsonic wind the magnetic field grows proportionally to @xmath21 that is the distance to the axis of stellar rotation .",
    "alfvnic mach number @xmath22 in the subsonic wind , so it decreases with the distance rapidly . in the the supersonic wind @xmath23",
    "remains constant .",
    "for the sun , for example , the constant is about 15 . at the strong shock @xmath23 decreases by factor of @xmath24 that is equal to @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "downstream the ts @xmath27 and then it decreases in the equatorial plane as @xmath28 .",
    "the alfvnic mach number becomes on the order of unity at the distances of @xmath29 .",
    "therefore at these distances and further one can expect a strong influence of the magnetic field on the plasma flow .",
    "magnetic force @xmath30 \\times \\mathbf{b})/(4\\pi)$ ] has a main component in @xmath31-direction ( in cylindrical ( @xmath32 , @xmath31 , @xmath20 ) coordinate system ; @xmath32-axis is the axis of stellar rotation ) . as a result ,",
    "the stellar wind flow deflects from the original radial direction and flows along the stellar rotation axis ( @xmath32-axis ) .",
    "therefore the two - jets structure of the flow is formed .    in this paper",
    "we further explore the solution of the problem .",
    "section  2 gives the mathematical formulation of the considered problem in dimensionless form .",
    "we have shown that the solution only depends on one dimensionless parameter . in section  3",
    "we have performed a theoretical study of the problem : this section presents three first integrals of the governing mhd equations .",
    "these integrals allow us to reduce the initial system of partial differential equations ( pde ) to the system of algebraic equation at the stagnation point in the equatorial plane and to the system of ordinary differential equations ( ode ) in jets far from the star .",
    "section  4 presents the results of parametric numerical study of the problem .",
    "section  5 gives summary and discusses problems remaining for future work .",
    "as shown in section  1 , the radial magnetic field component @xmath33 is proportional to @xmath34 in the kinematic solution , i.e. it is very small at the distance of ts and beyond . in this paper",
    "we neglect @xmath33 and assume the magnetic field to be purely azimuthal . under this assumption",
    "the flow becomes two - dimensional and axisymmetric with the stellar rotation axis as a symmetry axis . in the cylindrical coordinate system with the symmetry axis denoted by @xmath32 ,",
    "the system of governing equations can be written as follows : @xmath35 here @xmath36 , @xmath37 @xmath38 , @xmath39 are the density , two components of velocity and pressure , respectively ; @xmath40 is the @xmath20-component of the magnetic field ( index @xmath20 is omitted since the two other components are assumed to be zero ) ; @xmath41 is the ratio of specific heats .    in order to set the boundary conditions in the supersonic stellar wind at a certain distance @xmath42 we should specify the stellar wind velocity @xmath43 , density @xmath44 , pressure @xmath45 and the azimuthal component of the magnetic field that depends on angle @xmath19 counted from the @xmath32-axis as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a constant .",
    "the distance @xmath48 should be taken in such a way , that the spiral magnetic field could be considered purely azimuthal for @xmath49 ( @xmath50 , see  ( [ parker_field ] ) ) .",
    "the outer boundary is the astropause / heliopause that is a tangential discontinuity with an unknown shape and position . the total pressure @xmath51 at this boundary equals to the interstellar pressure @xmath6 , and the normal component of the velocity at the astropause is zero : @xmath52 . notice that the purely azimuthal magnetic field is tangential to the outer boundary and the boundary condition @xmath53 is satisfied automatically .",
    "( @xmath54 is the normal component of magnetic field to the astropause . )",
    "to finish the formulation of the problem we have to set the boundary conditions far from the star in jets ( at infinity , @xmath55 ) . in the numerical model",
    "we assume the so - called soft boundary conditions there meaning that @xmath56 for all quantities .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we consider the hypersonic and hyperalfvnic stellar wind limit ( below for the sake of bravity we call it hypersonic limit ) , for which both the mach number and alfvnic mach number are much greater than unit : @xmath57 these conditions are satisfied inside the ts as long as they are satisfied at the inner boundary . inside the ts",
    "the solution of the system ( [ continuity])-([rotbb ] ) in the hypersonic limit can be written as follows : @xmath58 here @xmath59 is the stellar mass - loss rate and @xmath60 is a constant determined by the stellar magnetic field . in the hypersonic limit",
    "@xmath43 is equal to the terminal velocity , @xmath5 .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath61 in ( [ hypersonic_solution ] ) is calculated in the kinematic approach as discussed in the introduction .",
    "since the pre - shock solution is known in the hypersonic limit , the inner boundary conditions can be posed at any arbitrary distance @xmath48 ( inside the pre - shock region ) and the solution does not depend on this parameter . the conditions beyond the shock do not depend on @xmath45 in the hypersonic limit .",
    "however the alfvnic mach number becomes comparable with unity if @xmath62 is large enough . in the latter case",
    "the solution may depend on @xmath48 and the flow differs from the hypersonic one .",
    "we neglect such a possibility in the present analytical consideration , but the numerical solution will show it .      in order to formulate the problem in dimensionless form , we choose the distance to the termination shock for the purely gas - dynamic case ( @xmath63 ) as a characteristic distance : @xmath64 as the characteristic density and velocity we choose their values downstream from the termination shock for the purely gas - dynamic case : @xmath65 we define the dimensionless flow parameters as @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69    then the boundary conditions in dimensionless form are the following : @xmath70 @xmath71 where @xmath72 where @xmath43 , @xmath47 , @xmath44 , @xmath73 are velocity , magnetic field , density and alfvnic mach number at the ecliptic , respectively .",
    "the pressure balance condition at tangential discontinuity is @xmath74 where @xmath75    we have already mentioned above that we restrict our analytical consideration to the hypersonic limit for which the solution does not depend on @xmath76 .",
    "therefore the solution of the considered problem in dimensionless form only depends on one dimensionless parameter , @xmath0 ( we assume the parameter @xmath41 to be equal to @xmath77 and do not vary it ) .",
    "hypersonic limit prohibits this parameter to be too large : @xmath78 .",
    "note that , if @xmath79 ( i.e. @xmath80 ) while @xmath81 , than the distance to the inner boundary @xmath76 becomes an important parameter .    from here and",
    "then we omit  hats \" assuming all of the quantities to be dimensionless .",
    "first let us introduce a streamline function @xmath82 , which is defined in axisymmetric case as follows : @xmath83 at the inner boundary sphere ( @xmath42 ) @xmath82 can be expressed as following : @xmath84    the problem formulated in the previous section has three first integrals along a streamline : @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87    the first integral ( eq .",
    "( @xmath88 ) ) is the bernoulli integral generalized for the case of mhd ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "( @xmath89 ) is the integral that follows from eqs .",
    "( @xmath90 ) and ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "( @xmath92 ) is the adiabatic condition .",
    "the right - hand parts of these equations , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 are constants along steamlines .",
    "the expressions for these constants have been easily deduced from the inner boundary conditions in their dimensionless form .",
    "note , however , that the entropic integral ( [ entrop ] ) is not conserved at the ts .",
    "@xmath96 could be explicitly derived in the post - shock region only if the exact form of the ts is given _ a  priori_. the constants in the other two integrals ( eqs .",
    "( @xmath88 ) ,  ( @xmath89 ) ) do not depend on the ts , though .",
    "if the pre - shock flow and the form of the ts are known we can derive the flow parameter distribution downstream from the ts using the rankine - hugoniot relations .",
    "therefore we can explicitly derive the entropic integral constant .",
    "for instance , if we assume the pre - shock flow to be hypersonic ( see  solution  ( [ hypersonic_solution ] ) ) and the ts to be spherical ( @xmath97 ) , we get : @xmath98 where the corresponding values of pressure and density downstream the ts are derived as follows from the rankine - hugoniot conditions :    @xmath99    note that the magnetic field upstream the ts was not neglected when eqs .",
    "( [ ts_distr ] ) were derived .",
    "therefore in our study we have neglected the dynamic effects of the magnetic field in the pre - shock region but not at the shock and beyond .",
    "note also that if we apply the strong shock conditions for the spherical shock instead , i.e. : @xmath100 than the bernoulli integral  ( [ bernoulli ] ) is not conserved at the shock due to neglect of the magnetic field upstream the ts .",
    "the three first integrals mentioned above are not enough to determine the five unknown functions ( @xmath36 , @xmath39 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath40 ) .",
    "one should also consider the equation  ( [ psi ] ) and one of the equations ( [ v_z ] ) or ( [ v_r ] ) .",
    "it is not easier to solve numerically the system of eqs .",
    "( [ v_r ] ) , ( [ psi ] ) , ( [ bernoulli ] ) , ( [ magn ] ) and ( [ entrop ] ) in the entire region than to solve the system ( [ continuity])-([rotbb ] ) .",
    "nevertheless the three first integrals ( [ bernoulli])-([entrop ] ) help us to establish some interesting relations .",
    "the relation between the distances to the termination shock and to the astropause in the plane @xmath101 ( i.e. in the stellar equatorial plane ) can be obtained if we consider the streamline @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) that passes through the critical point at the astropause .    at the critical point @xmath104 , therefore , the three first integrals ( @xmath88 ) , ( @xmath89 ) , ( @xmath92 ) together with the boundary condition ( @xmath105 ) provide four relations connecting six quantities .",

    "these estimations are based on the stellar parameters from table 3 of @xcite and table 6 of @xcite , respectively .",
    "therefore physically reasonable interval for parameter @xmath0 may be wide and extend from 0.01 to 1 or even further .",
    "the distances to the ts and td decrease with increasing parameter @xmath0 , meaning that the jet becomes more collimated . for @xmath159",
    "the distance to the termination shock is @xmath167 and the distance to the astropause in equatorial plane is @xmath168 .",
    "the jet radius is @xmath169 . for @xmath160 the distances",
    "are even smaller ( figure  [ 2d_0.5 ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that for @xmath159 the termination shock is still very close to the spherically symmetric one ( although , a slight deflection from a sphere could be seen in the figure ) . for @xmath160",
    "the termination shock becomes distorted .",
    "the shock distance toward the pole is approximately @xmath170 smaller than in ecliptic .",
    "therefore the assumption of spherical ts that has been used in subsection  3.2 is not valid for @xmath171 .    since the stellar wind mass flux injected at the inner boundary",
    "should be evacuated through the jets , the smaller jet radius the larger both the velocity and density in the jet are .",
    "this is clearly seen from the comparison of plots ( a ) and plots ( b ) in figures [ 2d_0.01 ] , [ 2d_0.25 ] and [ 2d_0.5 ] . in the case of @xmath160",
    "the density in the jet is @xmath172 times larger than for @xmath158 .",
    "therefore jet - like astrospheres are potentially more observable for stars with the strong magnetic field .",
    "one can see from the plots of density that the flow between the ts and the td is nearly incompressible in the case of small epsilon and the magnetic field grows linearly with the distance from the symmetry axis as it should follow from the integral  ( [ magn ] ) ( see plots ( a ) and ( d ) in figure  [ 2d_0.01 ] ) . at the same time for large epsilon",
    "the flow is sufficiently compressible ( see plots ( a ) on figures [ 2d_0.25 ] and [ 2d_0.5 ] and figures [ 1d_preshock]-[1d_postshock_z ] ) .",
    "thus the behaviour of the magnetic field is not linear with respect to the distance from the symmetry axis ( see plots ( d ) on figures [ 2d_0.25 ] and [ 2d_0.5 ] and plots ( b ) on figures [ 1d_preshock ] and [ 1d_postshock_r ] ) .    to understand the plasma and magnetic field distribution on figures [ 2d_0.01 ] , [ 2d_0.25 ] and [ 2d_0.5 ] in detail it is very useful to plot ( see , plots ( f ) in figures [ 2d_0.01]-[2d_0.5 ] ) the @xmath31-projection of the sum of pressure and magnetic forces acting on the flow in equation  ( [ v_r ] ) : @xmath173    for all values of @xmath0 the maximum of the force ( directed toward the axis of symmetry ) in the subsonic region is in ecliptic plane just after the termination shock because the magnetic field jumps significantly ( by approximately the factor of four for @xmath26 ) .",
    "therefore the last term increases by the factor of @xmath174 .",
    "the magnetic force is partially compensated by the pressure gradient when the distance increases .",
    "@xmath175 remains negative in the entire region .",
    "the plasma flow is decelerated in the @xmath31-direction and the jet oriented toward the @xmath32-axis is formed .",
    "hence our numerical results do confirm the qualitative description of the jet formation given in section  1 of the present paper .    while for @xmath158 the role of the magnetic force is restricted to the subsonic region , for @xmath159 and @xmath160 the magnetic force",
    "is also significant in the supersonic region .",
    "hypersonic analytical solution  ( [ hypersonic_solution ] ) does not work in this case .",
    "similar to the subsonic region , the magnetic force acts toward the axis of symmetry ( @xmath32-axis ) .",
    "the plasma streamlines are slightly deflected towards the axis .",
    "this leads to a relative increase of the plasma number density in the pole direction and a slight relative decrease of it in the equatorial direction as compared to the hypersonic solution  ( [ hypersonic_solution ] ) .",
    "the described effect is seen in the isolines of the plasma density in plots ( a ) in figures [ 2d_0.25 ] and [ 2d_0.5 ] and especially in plot ( a ) on figure [ 1d_preshock ] .",
    "therefore for the cases of @xmath159 and @xmath160 the pre - shock density has the maximum at the pole ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "the maximum remains beyond the shock for the nearly spherical ( as for @xmath159 ) or ellipsoidal ( as for @xmath160 ) shock .",
    "further from the shock the density still slightly increases due to negative @xmath175 force . further small decrease of the density at the @xmath32-axis in the jet may be connected with the fact that the pressure gradient slightly overcomes the magnetic pressure .",
    "the slight pressure overcome may result in a small increase of the jet radius with @xmath32 .",
    "although the effect is small it can be recognized in figure [ 2d_0.5 ] .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the pressure maximum at the @xmath32-axis ( see plots ( c ) in figure [ 2d_0.5 ] ) corresponds to the minimum of the plasma velocity in this region , as it follows from the bernoulli integral ( see plots ( b ) in figure [ 2d_0.5 ] and the plot ( c ) on figure [ 1d_postshock_z ] ) .",
    "this local deceleration at the axis results in the larger velocities at the tangential discontinuity bounding the jet .",
    "since the velocity is larger at the td , the mach number is larger there . plots ( e ) in figures [ 2d_0.01 ] , [ 2d_0.25 ] and [ 2d_0.5 ] show the fast - magnetosonic mach number @xmath177 .",
    "it is also shown on one - dimensional plots ( d ) on figures [ 1d_preshock ] - [ 1d_postshock_z ] .",
    "note that fast magnetosonic wave speed is the only meaningful disturbance propagation speed in our case of axial symmetry and purely azimuthal magnetic field : @xmath178 for @xmath160 the flow in the jet becomes _ transsonic _ ( plot ( e ) on figure [ 2d_0.5 ] and plot ( d ) on figure [ 1d_postshock_z ] ) in a sense that the fast - magnetosonic mach number in the jet becomes very close to unity near the @xmath32-axis and even greater near the tangential discontinuity .    for even larger values of @xmath0 ( say , for @xmath179 ) the flow stops at some point on the symmetry axis downwind from the ts and turns around forming an eddy that causes sufficient numerical problems .",
    "the flow in the jet becomes completely supersonic .",
    "we do not show the results for this case because of possible computational uncertainties .     and for @xmath160 .",
    "each integral should remain constant along a streamline.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=15.5% ]   and for @xmath160 .",
    "each integral should remain constant along a streamline.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=15.5% ]   and for @xmath160 .",

    "in the present paper we consider a model of the stellar wind interaction with the ism that is at rest with respect to the star .",
    "the two jets along the stellar rotation axis are formed due to the effects of the azimuthal stellar magnetic field in the model .",
    "the main results of the present paper can be summarized as following :    * it is shown that under the assumption of the hypersonic stellar wind outflow ( @xmath81,@xmath180 ) the considered problem has only one dimensionless parameter , @xmath0 , which is inversely proportional to the alfvn mach number",
    ". this parameter increases linearly with the increasing stellar magnetic field . *",
    "the three first integrals ( [ bernoulli])-([entrop ] ) of the mhd equations ( [ continuity])-([rotbb ] ) allow us to establish analytical ( or semi - analytical  in the form of algebraic equations ) relations between three parameters  ( 1 ) the distance to the termination shock , @xmath107 , ( 2 ) the distance to the astropause , @xmath106 ( both are in the stellar equatorial plane i.e. the plane perpendicular to the axis of the stellar rotation ) , and ( 3 ) the parameter @xmath0 . for",
    "a given value of @xmath107 one can obtain @xmath106 as a function of @xmath0 . however this solution is not self - consistent . *",
    "the distribution of the plasma parameters in the jet as well as the size of the jet have been obtained as a solution of an ode under assumptions of the hypersonic stellar wind outflow and the spherically symmetric termination shock .",
    "one should _ a priori _ give the distance to the ts in order to obtain this solution .",
    "therefore it is not a self - consistent solution . * using the solutions described above , we propose a method that allows to estimate the magnitude of the stellar magnetic field from the geometrical picture of a two - jet astrosphere . in particular , the knowledge ( for example , obtained from observations ) of two ratios  @xmath148 in the equatorial plane and @xmath146  allows us ( see figure  [ combined_contour_plot ] ) to determine the dimensionless quantities @xmath181 and @xmath0 .",
    "then , knowing @xmath0 and actual dimensional distance to the ts one can derive the magnitude of the stellar magnetic field at any given distance from the star .",
    "* the numerical solution of the mhd equations ( [ continuity])-([rotbb ] ) allowed us to establish the functional dependences of @xmath182 and @xmath183 ( see   eqs .",
    "( [ rtd_fit ] )  and  ( [ rjet_fit ] ) ) .",
    "* we have performed the numerical parametric study by varying the parameter @xmath0 in the range from @xmath184 to @xmath185 .",
    "the details of the numerical solution are shown on figures  [ 2d_0.01]-[1d_postshock_z ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that there is a good agreement between analytical / semi - analytical and numerical results for plasma parameter distribution in the jet , as well as for @xmath106 and @xmath141 .",
    "all discrepancies are due to approximations that lay on the base of ode problem formulation ( hypersonic pre - shock flow and spherically symmetric ts ) ; these approximations were used for the sake of simplicity and could , in principle , be relaxed .    in conclusion",
    "we have to note that we do not present the results of our numerical calculations for @xmath186 and for @xmath187 , because we are not completely sure that they are correct .",
    "vortex flows beyond the termination shock are formed in the both cases .",
    "the extension of the presented parametric study will be elaborated in the future .",
    "we have noticed in subsection 3.2 that the system of ode in jet region has a remarkable property that may allow us in principle to determine @xmath3 as a function of @xmath0 even without solving the full problem .",
    "we plan to further elaborate this point in future work .",
    "finally in this paper we restricted ourselves to a very limiting case when the interstellar medium is at rest with respect to the star .",
    "this two - jet solution can , in principle , be generalized by adding the interstellar flow .",
    "let us consider an arbitrary plane perpendicular to @xmath32-axis .",
    "this plane cuts a circle from the astropause . in the case of subsonic ism flow we can consider planar potential solutions around circles for each plane . according to the dalembert paradox the force acting on each circle is zero .",
    "therefore the tube of the astropause should not be deflected into the tail , although the circle could be deformed to the ellipsoidal shape in the self - consistent solution .",
    "this scenario works , if we consider the interstellar flow to be ideal and incompressible",
    ". however numerical results ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show some bending of the jets toward the tail .",
    "this bending in numerical models ( for slow incompressible ism flows ) is connected with the numerical dissipation inherent in the numerical schemes .",
    "numerical viscosity may cause the boundary layer breakage on the surface of the astropause , that consequently causes the pressure asymmetry that deflects the astropause . this may be the explanation for the fact , that the tube of the astropause is always deflected to the tail in the numerical models .",
    "the described above numerical effects have nothing to do with physical dissipation phenomena responsible for the bending of real astrospheres .",
    "the physical dissipation mechanisms ( e.g. magnetic reconnection , finite resistivity , hall effects ) should be explored as a possible cause of the astropause bending in the models with slow subsonic ism flow . for the fast supersonic ism flow , the bow shock is formed around the astropause .",
    "the post - shock ism flow is vortical , and the dalembert paradox does not work in this case .",
    "therefore the bending of the astrospheric jets into the tail direction is easier to justify for the supersonic relative ism / sw motion .",
    "another important aspect that strongly influences the solar wind plasma flow is the interaction with the interstellar atoms due to the charge exchange .",
    "the charge exchange provides additional momentum to the plasma towards the tail as it was first shown by @xcite .",
    "see also a recent paper by @xcite for the self - consistent kinetic - mhd model where both heliospheric and interstellar magnetic fields are taken into account .",
    "additional important aspect of the considered problem is the stability of the obtained two - jet solution and the tangential discontinuity ( e.g. astropause ) .",
    "theoretical considerations elaborated in the papers by @xcite and @xcite could be applied here .",
    "this work has been supported by rsf grant no .  14 - 12 - 01096 .",
    "this work has been benefited form discussions of international issi teams no .",
