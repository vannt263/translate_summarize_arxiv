    "the existence of extra dimensions seems to be a crucial ingredient in the unification of gravity with the gauge forces .",
    "this is the case , for example , of string theory , where more than three spatial dimensions seem to be necessary for the consistency of the theory .",
    "it has often been assumed that these extra dimensions are compact , with radii of planckean size , @xmath6 cm , and therefore irrelevant for phenomenological purposes .    nevertheless , it has recently been suggested that these extra dimensions could , in fact , be very large and testable in present - day experiments .",
    "the first possibility of lowering the compactification scale to @xmath7tev was given in ref .",
    "a different , and more drastic , possibility , suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite , is to lower the fundamental ( string ) scale down to the electroweak scale .",
    "this scenario requires either very large extra dimensions , in which only gravity propagates  @xcite , or a very small string coupling  @xcite . having the fundamental ( string ) scale close to the tev implies that the extra dimensions must appear at energies @xmath7 tev ( or below for the case of gravity ) , and therefore such a possibility can be tested in future colliders .    in this paper",
    "we want to study the implications of an extra tev@xmath8 dimension .",
    "we will consider the case of the standard model ( sm ) gauge bosons propagating in this extra dimension , and analyze the implications of their kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations for electroweak and flavor processes .",
    "the effects of these kk excitations are of two kinds .",
    "first , the kk excitations can mix with the @xmath9 and @xmath10 boson of the sm and , consequently , modify their masses and couplings .",
    "second , the kk excitations can induce new four - fermion operators in the sm lagrangian .",
    "all these effects are in principle large , since they arise at the tree level .",
    "using the fact that the experimental data seem to be in excellent agreement with the sm , we will be able to put bounds on the compactification scale @xmath11 . from the high - precision electroweak data , we obtain @xmath12@xmath3 tev ( depending on the model ) .",
    "since only the weak charge , @xmath4 , measured in atomic parity violation experiments , seems to depart by a few sigmas from the sm prediction  @xcite , we will briefly discuss how an extra dimension can improve the sm fit .",
    "kk excitations can also induce flavor - violating interactions if fermions of different families live at different points of the extra dimension , or if some of them are localized at fixed points and others live in the bulk of the extra dimension .",
    "we find that this possibility suffers from severe bounds on @xmath11 , which are in certain cases as large as @xmath13 tev .",
    "part of the analysis done here has previously been considered in the literature @xcite .",
    "our analysis , however , aims to be the most general one and thus it incorporates new scenarios not considered before .",
    "for example , we will allow some of the sm fermions to live in the bulk of the extra dimension , or to be localized at different points of the extra dimension .",
    "as we will see , these possibilities offer a new and rich phenomenology , especially concerning flavor physics .",
    "we will also consider the case in which the higher dimensional theory is supersymmetric and yields , after compactification to 4d , the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) .",
    "this case had not been analyzed before and we will show that , surprisingly , there are tree - level effects arising from integrating out the superpartners .",
    "the reason of these effects is the existence of a scalar su(2)@xmath14-triplet ( required by supersymmetry in five dimensions ) that gets a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the order of @xmath15 , and modifies the relation between the @xmath9 and @xmath10 masses .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ effective ] we consider the sm in 5d and compute the effective 4d theory obtained after integrating out the kk excitations of the sm gauge fields , assuming the most general framework where the sm fermions can live either at fixed points or in the bulk of the extra dimension . in section  [ susy ] we perform a similar exercise for the case where the 5d theory is supersymmetric .",
    "we pay particular attention to the modification of the effective theory generated by the vev of the 5d gauge superpartner .",
    "this vev is always non - zero whenever a higgs field acquires a vev at the boundary of the extra dimension . in section  [ electroweak ]",
    "we compute the predictions of the theory for different electroweak observables , and present the corresponding bounds on @xmath11 in section  [ bounds ] . in section  [ flavor ]",
    "we consider the effect of the kk excitation on flavor observables such as @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and derive new bounds on @xmath11 .",
    "section  [ conclusion ] is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "a word of caution on our calculation is in order .",
    "since we are working with gauge theories in more than four dimensions , one could be worried about the validity of the perturbative expansion of the theory .",
    "higher dimensional theories are known to be strongly coupled at energies above the compactification scale @xmath11 , implying a cutoff at @xmath19@xmath20 @xmath11 .",
    "this means that we can only trust the effect of the first @xmath21@xmath20 kk excitations .",
    "the effect of the heavy @xmath22 kk modes ( @xmath23@xmath20 ) , although not calculable , is estimated to be @xmath24 of the light kk - modes effect .",
    "the uncertainty of the effect of an extra dimension in low - energy processes , @xmath25 , is thus lower than @xmath26 .",
    "similarly stringy effects will be small if the string scale is at least one order of magnitude larger than the compactification radius as we will consider here .",
    "the model we want to study is based on a simple extension of the sm to 5d @xcite .",
    "the fifth dimension @xmath27 is compactified on the orbifold @xmath28 , a circle of radius @xmath29 with the identification @xmath30 .",
    "this is a segment of length @xmath31 with two 4d boundaries , one at @xmath32 and another at @xmath33 ( the two fixed points of the orbifold ) .",
    "this type of compactification is needed to get chiral fermions .",
    "the sm gauge fields live in the 5d bulk , while the sm fermions , @xmath34 , and the higgs doublets , @xmath35  , can either live in the bulk or be localized on the 4d boundaries . in this section",
    "we will assume that all the localized fields live on the @xmath32 boundary .",

    "the precise assignment is a matter of definition .",
    "we will choose the even assignment for the @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) components of fermions @xmath34 , which are doublets ( singlets ) under su(2)@xmath14 .",
    "as a consequence only the @xmath47 of su(2)@xmath14 doublets and @xmath48 of su(2)@xmath14 singlets have zero modes ( see eq .",

    "( [ fourier ] ) and integrating over the fifth dimension , we can easily obtain the theory in 4d .",
