    "in the preprint @xcite , oliinychenko , bugaev and sorin have considered the role of conservation laws , the values of hard core radii along with the effects of the lorentz contraction of hadron eigen volumes in discussing the weaknesses of thermal models which are utilized in describing the hadron multiplicities measured in the central nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "regardless the unawareness of earlier literature , the authors concluded that none of the criteria for the chemical freeze - out is robust . in doing this",
    ", they entirely disregarded the experimental results in baryo - chemical potentials @xmath1 and their corresponding temperatures @xmath2 .",
    "a systematic analysis of the four criteria describing the chemical freeze - out is introduced in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a comparison between these four criteria is elaborated in @xcite .",
    "starting from phenomenological observations at sis energy , it was found that the averaged energy per averaged particle @xmath3gev @xcite , where boltzmann approximations are applied in calculating @xmath4 , this constant ratio is assumed to describe the whole @xmath5 diagram . for completeness , we mention that the authors assumed that the pions and rho - mesons get dominant , at high @xmath2 and small @xmath1 .",
    "the second criterion assumes that total baryon number density @xmath6@xmath7 @xcite . in framework of percolation theory , the authors of ref . @xcite",
    "have suggested a third criterion . as shown in fig .",
    "2 of @xcite , the last two criteria seem to give almost identical results .",
    "all of them are stemming from phenomenological observation . a fourth criterion based on lattice qcd simulations",
    "was introduced in ref .",
    "accordingly , the entropy normalized to cubic temperature is assumed to remain constant over the whole range of baryo - chemical potentials , which is related to the nucleus - nucleus center - of - mass energies @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "an extensive comparison between constant @xmath4 and constant @xmath9 is given in @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic quantities deriving the chemical freeze - out . in framework of hadron resonance gas",
    "are deduced @xcite .",
    "explicit expressions for @xmath10 at vanishing and finite temperature are introduced @xcite .",
    "the motivation of suggesting constant normalized entropy is the comparison to the lattice qcd simulations with two and three flavors .",
    "we simply found the @xmath11 for two flavors and @xmath12 for three flavors .",
    "furthermore , we confront the hadron resonance gas results to the experimental estimation for the freeze - out parameters , @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "the hadron resonances treated as a free gas  @xcite are conjectured to add to the thermodynamic pressure in the hadronic phase ( below @xmath13 ) .",
    "this statement is valid for free as well as strong interactions between the resonances themselves .",
    "it has been shown that the thermodynamics of strongly interacting system can also be approximated to an ideal gas composed of hadron resonances with masses @xmath14gev  @xcite .",
    "such a mass cut - off is implemented to avoid the hagedorn singularity @xcite .",
    "therefore , the confined phase of qcd , the hadronic phase , is modelled as a non - interacting gas of resonances .",
    "the grand canonical partition function reads z(t , v ) & = & , where @xmath15 is the hamiltonian of the system and @xmath2 is the temperature .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by the sum of the kinetic energies of relativistic fermi and bose particles .",
    "the main motivation of using this hamiltonian is that it contains all relevant degrees of freedom of confined and strongly interacting matter .",
    "obviously , it can be characterized by various - but a complete - set of microscopic states and therefore the physical properties of the quantum systems turn to be accessible in approximation of non - correlated _ free _ hadron resonances .",
    "each of them is conjectured to add to the overall thermodynamic pressure of the _ strongly _ interacting hadronic matter .",
    "it includes implicitly the interactions that result in resonance formation .",
    "in addition , it has been shown that this model can submit a quite satisfactory description of particle production in heavy - ion collisions @xcite . with the above assumptions",

    "the strangeness chemical potential @xmath26 is calculated as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath27 under the assumption that the overall strange quantum number has to remain conserved in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "the hrg calculations assume quantum statistics and an overall strangeness conservation . with this regard",
    ", the strangeness chemical potential @xmath26 is calculated at each value of @xmath2 and @xmath1 assuring that the number of strange particles should be the same as that of the anti - strange particles .",

    "the value assigned to @xmath10 @xcite is larger than the actual one , the value resulted from order conditions . the reason is illustrated in the right panel . at different values for @xmath1 , the thermal evolution of @xmath10 is presented .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath10 never reaches @xmath0 at @xmath36mev .",
    "it is essential to bear in mind that the value @xmath0 has almost no physical interpretation .",
    "it is just an _ ad hoc _ value .",
    "this makes it inapplicable at alternating gradient synchrotron ( ags ) and schwer - ionen - synchrotron ( sis ) energies .",

    "the particle production at freeze - out is conjuncted to fully fulfil the laws of thermodynamics , as eq .",
    "( [ eq : thrml ] ) .",
    "the hadronic abundances observed in the final state of heavy - ion collisions are settled when @xmath9 drops to @xmath41 i.e. , the degrees of freedom drop to @xmath42 .",
    "meanwhile the changing in the particle number with the changing in the collision energy is given by @xmath1 , the energy that produces no additional work , i.e. the stage of vanishing free energy , gives the entropy at the chemical equilibrium . at the chemical freeze - out",
    ", the equilibrium entropy represents the amount of energy that ca nt be used to produce additional work . in this context , the entropy is defined as the degree of sharing and spreading the energy inside the system that is in chemical equilibrium @xcite .",
    "once again , related literature on lattice qcd simulations is not cited in @xcite . for example , borsanyi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the trajectories of constant @xmath10 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 , on the phase diagram and thermodynamic observables along these isentropic lines .",
    "this was not the only work devoted to such line of constant physics @xcite . in stefan - boltzmann limit",
    ", the ratio @xmath10 is assumed to remain unchanged with increasing @xmath1 ( appendix a of @xcite ) . in doing this , lowest order in perturbation theory is assumed , where strangeness chemical potential @xmath26 likely vanishes . for @xmath45 , a limiting behavior for the isentropic lines on the phase diagram",
    "is obtained .",
    "the ratio @xmath10 has been measured at various @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "it is concluded that in limits of low temperatures , increasing the chemical potential results in an overestimation for the ratio @xmath10 even beyond the applicability region of the taylor - expansion method , which is applied in lattice qcd simulations at finite chemical potential .",
    "two remarks are now in order .",
    "first , the values of @xmath10 seem to depend on the chemical potential @xmath1 or @xmath8 .",
    "this is confirmed in different experiments @xcite and lattice gauge theory @xcite .",
    "second , the ratio @xmath10 as calculated in the lattice qcd simulations @xcite is suggested to characterized the qcd phase diagram @xcite .",
    "the qcd phase diagram is likely differs from the freeze - out diagram @xcite , especially at large chemical potential @xmath1 or small @xmath8 so that at fixed @xmath1 the critical temperature differs from the freeze - out temperature .",
    "in fig . [ fig : tmu1 ] , the freeze - out parameters , @xmath2 and @xmath1 , measured in various heavy - ion collisions experiments are compared with the three criteria , @xmath46gev ( dashed line ) , @xmath47 ( dotted line ) and @xmath12 ( solid line ) .",
    "the experimental data are taken from @xcite and the reference therein .",
    "the quality of each criterion is apparent .",
    "all conditions are almost equivalent at very high energy",
    ". the ability of the condition @xmath46gev at very low energies are not as much as that of @xmath12 . as discussed in section [ sec : phys ] , @xmath47 seems to fail to reproduce the freeze - out parameters at @xmath36mev . to illustrate the reason for this observation , the thermal evolution of @xmath10 at very high chemical potential calculated in hrg is presented in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sn1 ] .",
    "details on hrg are elaborated in section [ sec : hrg ] .",
    "it is obvious that the value assigned to @xmath10 would be achieved at @xmath36mev . in other words , it is obvios that the behavior of @xmath10 is non - monotonic .",

    "[ fig : sn1 ] presents the energy scan for the three criteria , @xmath4 , @xmath35 and @xmath10 calculated in hrg , section [ sec : hrg ] at @xmath12 .",
    "the calculations in hrg are performed as follows . starting with a certain @xmath1",
    ", the temperature is increased very slowly . at this value of @xmath1 and at each increase in @xmath2 ,",
    "the strangeness chemical potential @xmath26 is determined to assure strangeness conservation .",
    "having the three values of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath26 , then all thermodynamic quantities are calculated .",

    "this procedure is repeated over all values of @xmath1 .",
    "we find that @xmath12 assures @xmath47 and @xmath46gev at small @xmath1 ( large @xmath8 ) . at large @xmath1 ( small @xmath8 ) , the values of @xmath10 gets smaller values , so that the applicability of @xmath47 is limited to @xmath48mev . in conclusion ,",
    "the robustness of @xmath47 is very much limited in comparison to the four criteria : percolation @xcite , baryon number @xcite , energy per particle @xcite and normalized entropy @xcite .",
    "that @xmath9 is accompanied with constant @xmath10 has been introduced in ref . @xcite . that authors of @xcite argue that @xmath47 is novel likely reflects an ignorance of related literature .",
