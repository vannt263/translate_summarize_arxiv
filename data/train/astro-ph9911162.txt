    "the search for primeval galaxies has been one of the long  term programs of observational cosmology , along with the development of sensitive detectors , and is currently receiving an exciting boost with the new generation of 8metre class telescopes .",
    "however , the search itself is somewhat hampered by the fuzziness of the concept of `` primeval galaxy '' .",
    "this is generally understood as being `` a galaxy which is captured at the epoch of its formation '' . since there are several competing theories about what a forming galaxy should look like , it is readily possible that we are missing part of the process of galaxy formation because we do not know yet what to search for .",
    "more specifically , two general paradigms have been proposed in the last twenty years or so . in the picture of monolithic collapse , galaxies form at a given epoch @xmath0 ,",
    "when the physical conditions of the universe are favourable , and evolve at different rates which are fixed by the initial conditions . in the picture of hierarchical collapse , there is nothing like a given redshift of galaxy formation .",
    "larger galaxies form from the merging of smaller ones , which on their turn have formed from the merging of still smaller lumps , and so on .",
    "the beginning of the process took place at some early redshift @xmath1 ( when the first objects can cool ) and is still going on now .",
    "as a result , the `` epoch of galaxy formation '' can be defined e.g. as the epoch when the first stars formed , when 50 % of the stars have formed , or when the morphology was fixed after the last major merging event .",
    "this hierarchical galaxy formation is now modelled in the context of hierarchical clustering where dark matter completely rules gravitational collapse .",
    "the models of galaxy formation have to reproduce the wide variety of objects which are now observed at high redshift , probably after strong observational biasses that are not fully understood .",
    "these objects are generally selected according to photometric criteria .",
    "we now have luminous blue compact galaxies ( lbcgs ; @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , lyman  break galaxies ( lbgs ; @xmath4 or @xmath5 , and @xmath6 ) , extremely red objects ( eros ; @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) , lyman alpha galaxies ( lags ; @xmath5 or @xmath9 , and @xmath10  ) , faint submm sources that are likely to be the high@xmath11 counterparts of the local `` ultraluminous infrared galaxies '' discovered by iras ( high@xmath11 ulirgs ; @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xmath14 ) , damped lyman @xmath15 absorbers ( dlas ; @xmath16 atom @xmath17 ) , etc . in order to link the predictions of the models of galaxy formation with these observations , it is necessary to model the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) on the widest wavelength range , from the rest  frame uv to the rest  frame submm .",
    "as a matter of fact , several pieces of observational evidence are now converging to show that there is a significant amount of extinction in high  redshift galaxies .",
    "consequently , the absorption and emission processes due to dust can not be neglected in assessing the luminosity budget of forming galaxies . among these pieces of evidence",

    "_ 1998 ) .",
    "\\(vii ) the correlation of dust with metallicity has still to be understood , since , for instance , the extremely metal  poor galaxy sbs0335 - 052 ( 1/30 of solar ) has a significant ir emission ( thuan _ et al .",
    "we hereafter present a model of synthetic seds , called stardust , which contains up  to  date spectrophotometric modelling coupled to chemical evolution and dust absorption .",
    "the model allows one to make consistent predictions for the seds of galaxies in a very broad wavelength range .",
    "details can be found in devriendt _",
    "( 1999 ; hereafter dgs ) .",
    "the model uses the so  called `` isochrone scheme '' and includes a compilation of the geneva tracks ( see e.g. charbonnel _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , and references therein ) for various metallicities @xmath27 , and masses 0.8 @xmath28 120 . for stars less massive than @xmath29 ,",
    "some of the old tracks stop at the giant branch tip .",
    "more recent grids of models , based on geneva tracks and covering the evolution of low mass stars ( 0.8 to 1.7 @xmath30 ) from the zero  age main sequence up to the end of the early  agb , are included for @xmath31 0.001 and @xmath31 0.02 . for the late stages of other metallicities ( horizontal branch , early ",
    "agb ) , we either interpolate or extrapolate @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 versus @xmath35 from the available tracks .",
    "the final stages of the stellar evolution ( thermally  pulsing  agb and post  agb ) are not included .",
    "we use the grid of theoretical fluxes from kurucz ( 1992 ) which covers all metallicities from @xmath36 to @xmath37 , and 61 temperatures from 3500 k to 50 000 k. each spectrum spans a wavelength range between 90 @xmath38 and 160 @xmath18 m , with a mean resolution of 20 @xmath38 . for the coldest stars ( k and m - type stars ) with @xmath39 3750 k ,",
    "kurucz s models fail to reproduce the observed spectra .",
    "therefore , we prefer to use models coming from different sources ( see dgs ) .    fig 1 gives the passive evolution of a simple stellar population with salpeter imf ( slope @xmath40 from @xmath41 to @xmath42 @xmath43 ) .",
    "fig 2 compares our stardust model with other models available in the literature ( see dgs for details ) : gissel 1998 ( bruzual and charlot , 1993 ) , pgase ( fioc and rocca  volmerange , 1997 ) , and our stardust .",
    "though the stellar data are different , the agreement is generally very good in the uv / visible , except when post  agb are dominant ( that is , in old stellar populations without star formation activity ) . in particular , the uv to sfr ratio that is used to derive the cosmic sfr from rest ",
    "frame 1600   or 2800   observations is remarkably similar in the three models .",
    "our model computes chemical evolution and takes into account the effect of metallicity on the stellar tracks and stellar spectra in a consistent way .",
    "in addition , the metallicity of the gas is followed . under simple assumptions on the variation of the extinction curve with metallicity ( based on the study of the milky way , the large magellanic cloud , and the small magellanic cloud ) , and on the geometry and relative distributions of dust and stars ( homogeneous mix in an oblate spheroid )",
    ", transfer can be easily solved , and the amount of luminosity absorbed by dust is estimated .",
    "the seds in the ir / submm are then computed to reproduce the correlation of iras colours with total ir luminosity @xmath44 , following guiderdoni _",
    "( 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "the model reproduces the obscuration curve of calzetti _ et al . _",
    "( 1994 ) observed in a sample of nearby starbursts .",
    "it also reproduces the correlation of ir to 2200   flux with the uv slope @xmath45 of the seds ( around 2200  ) observed by meurer _",
    "( 1995 ) .    finally , the optical and ir / submm spectra are connected to give evolving synthetic seds from the far uv ( 90  ) to the submm ( @xmath46 mm ) . in the centimetre and metre range",
    ", a radio component can be added under assumptions on the slope and on the correlation of radio fluxes with ir fluxes .",
    "the seds depend on three parameters ( in addition to the imf ) : the sfr timescale @xmath47 , the age @xmath48 , and a concentration parameter @xmath49 that describes the size of the gaseous disk ( @xmath50 is for normal spirals , and a radial collapse by a factor 10 corresponds to @xmath51 ) .",
    "fig 3 gives typical spectra for a spiral and a forming galaxy , without and with extinction ( respectively with @xmath50 and @xmath51 , this latter value being typical of an ulirg ) .",
    "fig 4 gives the fits of a sample of local galaxies obtained with our theoretical seds and a @xmath52 procedure .",
    "the sample gathers virgo cluster spirals ( boselli _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) and ulirgs ( rigopoulou _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) that have a sufficient number of photometric points at optical , nir , mir , fir , and submm wavelengths ( and , for some of them , in the radio ) .",
    "nine spectra have been ordered in fig 4 according to their @xmath44 , in a sequence that parallels the compilation of sanders & mirabel ( 1996 ) .",
    "there is some degeneracy between the parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 of the fits , but their combination corresponds to similar sfrs .",
    "this is illustrative of the ability of the model to capture the characteristic features of the objects .",
    "this can be used to study the efficiency of the uv and ir fluxes to trace the underlying sfr .",
    "as shown in fig 5 , the uv fluxes do scale with sfr for optically  thin galaxies ( slope @xmath53 ) , but the proportionality breaks down for ulirgs . without any information on the optical thickness of the high  redshift galaxies , the rest ",
    "frame uv fluxes could lead to erroneous estimates .",
    "in contrast , the ir fluxes trace sfrs on several orders of magnitudes , with a slope 0.95 , and independently of the optical thickness .",
    "the origin of this behaviour is not clear yet .",
    "it is probably due to the fact that there are basically two regimes : either the galaxy is optically thin , and the ir roughly corresponds to a constant fraction of the uv , or it is optically thick , and all the uv flux is absorbed by dust and released in the ir .",
    "these galaxies can also be used to predict the photometric properties at higher redshift .",
    "fig 6 and 7 give the observer ",
    "frame optical magnitudes and ir / submm fluxes versus redshift .",
    "these synthetic seds can subsequently be implemented into semi  analytic models of galaxy formation .",
    "the interest of such an approach is that the distribution of the sfr timescales @xmath47 can be computed from the distribution of dynamical timescales @xmath54 of the host haloes , under the assumption @xmath55 , where @xmath45 is an efficiency parameter which is fixed observationally ( see e.g. kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "the ages @xmath48 of the stellar populations are computed from the formation redshifts and the redshifts at which the galaxies are observed .",
    "the distribution of the gas column densities is also computed from the size distribution of disks ( obtained from the size distribution of haloes after conservation of angular momentum ) . the ulirgs correspond to a further radial collapse by a factor 10 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "following guiderdoni _",
    "( 1997 , 1998 ) , devriendt & guiderdoni ( 1999 ) proposed results of faint galaxy counts that are produced by a simple , semi ",
    "analytic prescription using the peaks formalism .",
    "the usual recipes are implemented for gas cooling , dissipative collapse , and stellar feedback .",
    "it is assumed that dust is heated by starbursts , and that the star formation rate is @xmath56 , with @xmath57 .",
    "the spectra are taken from stardust .",
    "this paper gives predictions of faint counts at optical , ir , and submm wavelengths , for a variety of cosmologies .",
    "it turns out that the ionizing flux escaping from high  redshift galaxies estimated with this model is unable to ionize the intergalactic medium ( devriendt _ et al .",
    "these synthetic seds and the spectral templates of fig 4 are useful tools to analyse the panchromatic view on high  redshift , young and `` primeval '' galaxies .",
    "the spectral templates are available upon request to the authors .",
    "the implementation of such spectra into semi  analytic models is a promising way to predict the statistical properties of a host of objects that are now observed at high redshift , through various spectral windows , and with various selection criteria .",
    "however , the modelling of the sfr history of galaxies in the context of hierarchical galaxy formation is still incomplete . in particular , the ulirgs appear to be key objects to understand the formation of bulges .",
    "a more realistic treatment of such objects requires the monitoring of the merging rates , and involves keeping track of the spatial and dynamical information in models of galaxy formation .",
    "this can be done , for instance , with the new generation of the so  called `` hybrid '' models in which the merging history trees are directly built from the outputs of cosmological n  body simulations .",
    "the implementation of stardust into such models is in progress .",
