    "<S> the possibility of detecting mutations in a dna from force measurements ( as a first step towards sequence analysis ) is discussed theoretically based on exact calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the force signal is associated with the domain wall separating the zipped from the unzipped regions . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a comparison method ( `` differential force microscope '' ) to detect mutations . </S>",
    "<S> two lattice models are treated as specific examples .    </S>",
    "<S>     87.14gg , 87.80fe , 05.20gg    the possibility of a force induced unzipping transition @xcite has opened up new ways of exploring the properties of biomolecules . </S>",
    "<S> since the critical force for a double stranded dna depends on its sequence , an inverse problem can be posed : `` can the dna sequence be detected from the force required to unzip it ? '' a still simpler question would be : `` can the mutations in a dna be detected by force measurements ? '' . </S>",
    "<S> a positive answer to either of these questions would lead to the possibility of testing ( and detecting ) mutations and of sequence determination in a non - destructive way .    based on a few simple models used earlier for the dna denaturation and unzipping transitions@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> we show here the signature of mutations on the @xmath0-vs-@xmath1 curve ( force versus relative distance of the end points of the two strands ) . </S>",
    "<S> the inverse problem is then to get the position of the mutations from such an experimentally realizable curve . </S>",
    "<S> our emphasis in this paper is on the one base pair mutation problem also known as point mutation . </S>",
    "<S> this is not just of academic interest . </S>",
    "<S> the replication of dna is a high - fidelity process , thanks to the inbuilt proof - reading and repair mechanisms , so that mistakes are very rare though even one could play havoc .    </S>",
    "<S> our proposal ( solution of the inverse problem ) , based on exact calculations , is to obtain the force difference ( `` differential force '' ) between identically stretched native and mutant dnas . </S>",
    "<S> this could be done by using _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ two atomic force microscope tips : we name this apparatus a `` differential force microscope '' . </S>",
    "<S> the position of the mutation can be obtained from a calibration curve involving the extremum position ( or its value ) of the differential force curve . in our models </S>",
    "<S> , we can find the nature of the mutation from the sign of the differential force .    </S>",
    "<S> let us model a double stranded ( ds ) dna by two n - monomer polymers interacting at the same contour length ( or monomer index ) @xmath2 of the strands through a contact attractive potential @xmath3 , which might depend on the contour length . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction energy is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes the relative distance of the @xmath6th base pair and @xmath7 denotes the kronecker delta . </S>",
    "<S> other features like the self- and mutual - avoidance , base stacking energy , helicity , etc are ignored in this study ( but see below ) in order to focus on the base pairing energy . </S>",
    "<S> such a model exhibits a denaturation transition at a model - dependent temperature @xmath8@xcite from a low @xmath9 double stranded configuration to a high @xmath9 phase of two unpaired single strands .    a few definitions : starting with a sequence @xmath10 or bases of a dna ( to be called the native dna ) </S>",
    "<S> , we define a mutant dna as one with almost the same base sequence as the native molecule _ except _ a few base pairs . a homogeneous dna or homo - dna is a dna with identical base pairs ( i.e. @xmath11 for all @xmath2 ) while a heterogeneous dna is one with heterogeneity in the sequence ( @xmath2-dependent @xmath12 ) . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the model we have defined does not consider base pair stacking interaction and therefore does not distinguish _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ between an at and a ta ( or cg and gc ) base pair . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the mutations we are referring to are only those involving at ( or ta ) @xmath13 cg ( or gc ) .    </S>",
    "<S> two specific examples are considered here because of their exact tractability ( analytical and numerical ) : ( mi ) a two dimensional @xmath14 directed dna model ( with the strands directed along @xmath15 ) with base - pair interaction and mutual avoidance ( forbidden crossing of the strands ) , and ( mii ) two gaussian polymers with the base - pair interaction in @xmath16-dimensions . in both cases , only the relative chain , involving the separation * r * of the bases at the same contour length , need be considered . </S>",
    "<S> these models in addition to the denaturation transition also show , for @xmath17 , an unzipping transition in presence of a force at the free end ( @xmath18)@xcite . in this paper , we consider the conjugate fixed distance ensemble and henceforth restrict ourselves to @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we put @xmath19 unless explicitly shown , where @xmath20 is the boltzmann constant .    for any ds dna </S>",
    "<S> having their first monomers ( @xmath21 ) joined and their last monomers ( @xmath18 ) at a relative lattice distance @xmath22 , the force @xmath23 required to maintain this relative distance @xmath22 is @xmath24 where @xmath25 represents the free energy of the system in the fixed-@xmath22 ensemble@xmath26}$ ] . by definition , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath27 = @xmath28 which gives the free energy of binding or the work required to unzip completely dna .    </S>",
    "<S> the two ensembles , fixed - force and fixed - stretch , are expected to give identical results in the @xmath29 limit , though for finite @xmath30 inequivalence might be expected @xcite ( this is indeed the picture valid for the homo - dna ) , but a more serious situation arises if , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ for the scalar case , @xmath31 in the fixed - stretch ensemble because , in the fixed - force ensemble , @xmath32 @xmath33 , where @xmath34 denotes thermal averaging . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case for a heterogeneous dna as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the regions of `` wrong '' sign ( reminiscent of preshocks in burgers turbulence@xcite or of `` slip '' in ref.@xcite ) go away only after quenched averaging but do survive in the thermodynamic limit for each individual realization . _ </S>",
    "<S> the absence of self - averaging in the system is encouraging , because it implies that individual features , typical of a single realization of the sequence , are maintained in the characteristic curves . </S>",
    "<S> _ we draw attention to the overlap of the @xmath0 vs @xmath35 curves over a range of @xmath35 in fig . 1 for different lengths with identical sequence near the open end . </S>",
    "<S> this overlap is a sign that the modulation is a characteristic of the sequence , and we have found this to be true quite generally .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider the one mutation problem where the @xmath36-th pairing energy of the native dna has been changed from @xmath37 to @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> for this one site change in @xmath39 , the partition function @xmath40 is given by [ mutation_one ] z_n|k(*r*,n)=z_n(*r*,n)+c_k z_n(*r*,n , k ) . where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the native dna partition function with last monomers at a relative distance @xmath22 , while @xmath43 is with the additional constraint of the @xmath44th pair being zipped . </S>",
    "<S> notice that eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ mutation_one ] applies for both heterogeneous and homogeneous cases ( and also for self avoiding strands ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we define a zipping probability @xmath45 @xmath46 , which is the conditional probability that site @xmath36 is zipped when the free ends are at a distance @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the force difference ( to be called the differential force ) to keep the free ends of both the mutant and the native dna at the same distance @xmath22 can be written as @xmath47 [ mut3 ]    here @xmath48 is a generalized force , the one necessary to keep the free ends of the native dna at a relative distance @xmath22 when the @xmath44th monomers are zipped . </S>",
    "<S> except @xmath49 , all other quantities in eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ mut3 ] refer to the native dna . </S>",
    "<S> this fact allows the inverse problem to be tackled as we show explicitly for a few cases . since for dna we have generally two possible choices for @xmath50 , ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) </S>",
    "<S> , the sign of @xmath49 determines the sign of @xmath53 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ mut3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in our simple model , the nature of the mutation can be identified from the sign of the differential force curve . </S>",
    "<S> eqs . </S>",
    "<S> [ mutation_one],[mut3 ] can be generalized to more than one mutations and to models with other local energy parameters , though they become algebraically more involved . </S>",
    "<S> these more complicated cases will be discussed elsewhere . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the simplest case here .    </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath54 is the direction of stretching , the quantity @xmath55 has a kink - like behavior ( as in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] ) . in the fixed stretch ensemble </S>",
    "<S> , the chain separates into an unzipped and a zipped region separated by a domain wall , which to a very good approximation can be fit by a @xmath56 function :    @xmath57 }   /{w_{\\rm d}(k ) } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the position and the width of the wall ( kink ) , and @xmath60 is a constant . </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq:3 ] suggests that @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a scaling function .    </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to extend the above analysis to the general case where more than one mutation is present . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the partition function for the case with two mutations at positions @xmath63 and @xmath64 , in an obvious notation , is @xmath65 the last term of the above equation , representing correlation of the mutations , gives an additional contribution to the differential force over and above the individual contributions of the mutations . </S>",
    "<S> this additional contribution is negligible if the two mutations are far away or , more quantitatively , not in the same domain wall .    </S>",
    "<S> we now use these general results for cases ( mi),(mii ) .    in the two dimensional model ( mi ) , </S>",
    "<S> the partition function for two directed chains having their last monomers at a relative lattice distance @xmath35 ( along @xmath66 and in unit of the elementary square diagonal ) , and their first monomers joined , can be written in terms of n monomer - to - monomer transfer matrices @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) with matrix elements @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 being the position vectors ( with the constraint @xmath73 ) .    for a homo - dna with contact energy @xmath50 , </S>",
    "<S> the largest eigenvalue of @xmath74 determines the free energy and the thermodynamic properties in the limit @xmath75 . for @xmath76 , the melting temperature , @xmath77 with @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , in the fixed - stretch ensemble , any finite ( @xmath79 ) stretch puts the chain on the phase coexistence curve .    exploiting the equivalence of the ensembles valid for for homo - dna </S>",
    "<S> , we find @xmath80 , where [ characteristic ] ( y)&=&2 ^-1(\\{y , y_0 } ) , ( y_0^ ) , is a piecewise continuous non - analytic function . for finite @xmath30 , there is no singularity but the approximation of eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ characteristic ] still works quite well . at @xmath81 </S>",
    "<S> the force curve increases sharply ( see also fig.1 , curves ( a ) and ( c ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we now come to the explicit results for the one - mutation case where one @xmath50 is replaced by @xmath82 . for a homo - dna , by starting from eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ characteristic ] , using eqs . </S>",
    "<S> [ mut3],[eq:3 ] , one can find analytical approximations to the shapes of the previously introduced @xmath83 and @xmath53 in terms of piecewise continuous functions . </S>",
    "<S> we find _ e.g. _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath83 = @xmath84 , where ( if @xmath85 ) : @xmath86 [ eq:2 ] and @xmath87}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ mut3 ] now simplifies because @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristics of the differential force curve @xmath53 vs @xmath35 , such as the extremum value , its position and the width , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , can be determined from eqs . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq:2 ] as [ results ] f_max(k)~ [ w_f(k)]^-1 ~|k^-1/2 , x_f(k ) = |kx_f(|k ) with @xmath92 and @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is defined in eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ characteristic ] . </S>",
    "<S> the area of the peak , which yields the difference ( with respect to the native case ) in the work necessary to unzip completely the molecule , is constant as expected . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling form introduced after eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq:3 ] suggests that the differential force is significant only in the domain wall region and the width of the domain wall @xmath95 as we do see in the numerical results .    for model ( mii ) , with one - dimensional gaussian polymers ( @xmath96 ) </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath83 has been calculated exactly by a transfer matrix method and is shown in fig.2a . the validity of eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ results ] ( @xmath97 ) is apparent from the data - collapse of the various @xmath53 curves in fig.2b where @xmath98 is plotted against @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> the peak force difference , @xmath89 as a function of the mutant position @xmath36 is in accord with the @xmath100 law of eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ results ] . </S>",
    "<S> the results for model ( mi ) are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] . for @xmath101 ( @xmath102 as above ) </S>",
    "<S> the situation is similar as , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , the data - collapse of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] and eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ results ] remain valid .    coming to the case of one mutation on a heterogeneous dna consisting of two energies @xmath51 and @xmath103 chosen with equal probability </S>",
    "<S> , the shapes of the zipping probability curves are found to be similar to the homo - dna case , in fact indistinguishable on the plot of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] , with @xmath58 and @xmath59 sequence dependent . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates the validity of the domain wall interpretation even for a heterogeneous dna . </S>",
    "<S> the mutation involves a change of the energy at site @xmath36 ( i.e. @xmath104 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the signals @xmath53 for various mutations are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> as already mentioned , in our models the sign of @xmath53 tells us the nature of the mutation . </S>",
    "<S> these individual curves can again be collapsed on to a single one as for homo - dna , though the nature of collapse is not as good , mainly because the area under the curve is no longer strictly a constant . </S>",
    "<S> this reflects the importance of local sequences around the mutation point . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 ( curves b , c ) shows the @xmath36-dependence of @xmath90 . unlike for homo - dna , @xmath89 does not seem to have the simple form of curve ( a ) in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> although the linearity is maintained for @xmath90 as for the homogeneous case , there are regions of nonmonotonicity at small scales which hamper the inversion .    fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 gives a basis for a calibration curve . </S>",
    "<S> this could be @xmath90 or @xmath105 vs k ( or both ) for a homogeneous dna , though for heterogeneous dna , we find the @xmath106-vs-@xmath36 curve to be more reliable . </S>",
    "<S> given the value of @xmath90 , one can look up in fig.3 for the corresponding @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy of the method relies on the ability to resolve close - by mutation points , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ mutation points in the same domain wall . </S>",
    "<S> there are differences in the full profiles of the @xmath53 curves for mutations at , say , @xmath36 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , though translating that information back to the identification of the position is yet to be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> a better resolution is in any case obtained by changing the point at which the strands are pulled .    </S>",
    "<S> we now argue on how our calculation can compare with a potential experiment . in @xcite , the typical force arising in the unzipping </S>",
    "<S> is between @xmath109 and @xmath110 pn , while the resolution is set below @xmath111 pn , so in percentage it is @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> dynamical effects ( important in @xcite ) are almost negligible already at the lowest stretching velocity used in @xcite ( @xmath113 nm / s ) and are less important as the velocity is lowered . </S>",
    "<S> our values for the typical force at @xmath114 are at the border of this present day resolution ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , where it appears that the resolution is around @xmath115 for @xmath116 , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ on the middle of the chains ) . in principle </S>",
    "<S> they can be improved above it by lowering @xmath9 , though it is not clear to what extent this will work because the experimental temperature range is rather limited . in ref.@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the authors suggest that there will be experimental difficulties which would hamper the acquisition of the base by base sequence of dna by means of force measurements ( but would however allow to get information over groups of @xmath117 bases ) . </S>",
    "<S> this difficulty , though absent in our exact analysis of the models , might also set a lower limit on the error on the position of the mutation . </S>",
    "<S> summarizing , we prove that mutations are detectable in the theoretical models . </S>",
    "<S> numbers coming from our models suggest that this measurement might be a benchmark for present day real technology .    </S>",
    "<S> we finally propose an algorithm for sequencing dna from the unzipping force in our models . </S>",
    "<S> this is defined so that the energy of the @xmath118th base pair is @xmath52 if the average force at stretch @xmath119 is above the force signal of a homo - dna with an attractive energy @xmath120 ( @xmath9 is low enough that @xmath121 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our algorithm differs from the discussion in @xcite because @xmath9 and extra constraints ( see below ) play crucial roles . </S>",
    "<S> if we define the `` score '' of the algorithm as the fraction of base pairs correctly predicted , from our data we observe that for any finite - size sample the score is 100% for @xmath122 , with @xmath123 for @xmath124 . however , @xmath125 monomers near the open end can be sequenced at @xmath126 , no matter how big the total @xmath30 is . </S>",
    "<S> once this is done , we restart this time keeping the corresponding bases at position @xmath125 from the open end at a distance @xmath35 with the constraint that the monomers at @xmath30 are at a distance @xmath127 , to prevent rejoining in the already unzipped @xmath125 monomers . in this way we would sequence another @xmath125 monomers and so on . </S>",
    "<S> we have verified this for models ( mi ) and ( mii ) .    in conclusion , we studied the @xmath128 vs. @xmath22 characteristic curve in the fixed stretch ensemble for simple models of dna focusing on the base pairing energy only . </S>",
    "<S> we have seen that for a homo - dna , the force difference between a native and the corresponding one mutation case when pulled to the same distance contains enough signature to locate the position of the mutation . </S>",
    "<S> this could be the basis of a differential force microscope to detect mutations . for a heterogeneous dna </S>",
    "<S> , the mutation point can not be localized always as accurately as for homo - dna . </S>",
    "<S> accuracy could be achieved by taking cognizance of the full features of the @xmath53 curve . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the differential force curve can be understood as due to the domain wall separating the zipped and the unzipped phases as the strands are pulled apart . moreover , we found ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) that the modulations in the force curve are connected to the local sequence . </S>",
    "<S> this holds promise of extension of our proposal to cases beyond point mutation .    </S>",
