    "@xmath179 is a necessary condition for the existence of the one third saturation magnetization plateau .",
    "this conclusion is reasonable because the leg part of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is stronger than the rung part , due to the multispin interaction terms in eq.([intra ] ) .",
    "therefore , the rung coupling must be large enough in order to dominate the low temperature groundstate . if the rung coupling fulfills @xmath180 the field - induced fractional plateau vanishes .",
    "in fig . [ fig2 ] we show the full numerical magnetization curve for weak rung coupling @xmath181k .",
    "we clearly see that the fractional magnetization plateau is closed . from the tba analysis",
    "the first critical point @xmath15 lies in the interval @xmath182\\mu_b }    < h_{c1}\\!<\\!\\frac{3j_{\\perp}}{[g_t+3g_s+(g_s - g_t)/3]\\mu_b},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which for the given parameter set ( see figure captions ) evaluates to @xmath183 t. indeed , from the numerical results we find @xmath184 t. this implies that for @xmath185 t the groundstate is the doublet spin liquid phase .",
    "a magnetic field beyond this point allows the quadruplet component @xmath152 to be involved in the groundstate .",
    "therefore the critical point @xmath15 indicates a quantum phase transition from a two - state phase into a three - state phase .",
    "hence for @xmath186 t , two fermi seas , @xmath125 and @xmath187 , lie in the groundstate .",
    "we can see that the probability of the component @xmath152 to be in the groundstate increases as the magnetic field increases .",
    "meanwhile the doublet state @xmath188 is quickly driven out of the groundstate at the critical point @xmath16 , where the phase transition from the three - state into the two - state phase transition occurs . from eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) , we find the middle point between @xmath15 and @xmath16 is approximately at @xmath189 t , which is consistent with the numerical curve in fig .",
    "thus from the theory we predict the critical field to be @xmath190\\mu_b - h_{c1 } \\approx 0.715 $ ] t. this again is in agreement with the numerical value of @xmath191 t. in the region @xmath192 the two components @xmath193 and @xmath152 compete to be in the groundstate . if the magnetic field is strong enough , so that @xmath194 where @xmath26 is given by ( [ hc3 ] ) , the reference state @xmath152 becomes a true physical groundstate",
    "we have investigated the phase diagram of the exactly solved mixed spin-@xmath0 ladder model in both the absence and presence of an external magnetic field using the tba .",
    "it has been shown that in the strong antiferromagnetic rung coupling regime there exists a third and full saturation magnetization plateaux .",
    "a luttinger liquid magnetic phase exists in the regime @xmath195 , which corresponds to the doublet @xmath1 phase .",
    "the magnetic groundstate consisting of two components @xmath193 and @xmath152 lies in the regime @xmath192 .",
    "the ferromagnetic ground state with a third saturation magnetization plateau appears in the regime @xmath196 .",
    "the full saturation magnetization plateau opens at @xmath197 .",
    "the gapped or gapless states appear in turn as the magnetic field is increased .",
    "the weak rung coupling regime exhibits three different phase transitions , which involve two- and three - state quantum phase transitions .",
    "the fractional magnetization plateau vanishes .",
    "the model does not exihibit a third saturation magnetization plateau in the strong ferromagnetic rung coupling regime .",
    "we have also investigated the singular behaviour in the vicinity of the critical points via the solutions of the tba equations .",
    "as the contributions from the leg interaction to the groundstate energy are very small in the strong rung coupling regime we believe that the solvable model ( [ ham ] ) is well suited to describe the physics of real mixed spin-(@xmath198 ) ladder compounds with a relatively large rung coupling constant",
    ". however , such mixed spin ladder compounds are yet to be found .",
    "one compound that we are aware of is the organic ferrimagnet pnnbno @xcite , which has been recognized as a ladder compound with alternating spin-@xmath6 and spin-@xmath31 units , i.e. as two coupled alternating mixed spin chains .",
    "the strong interchain ( rung ) coupling suggests that pnnbno can be effectively identified as a mixed spin-(@xmath198 ) ladder model via the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) in the high temperature limit ( @xmath199 k ) . in this case",
    "the dominant rung interaction forms an effective one - dimensional spin-@xmath200 antiferromagnetic chain .",
    "of course for low temperatures the ferrimagnetic correlations between the spin-@xmath31 and spin-@xmath6 units should appear .",
    "nevertheless we believe that the mixed spin-(@xmath198 ) ladder model discussed here can at least describe the high temperature properties of pnnbno @xcite .    .",
