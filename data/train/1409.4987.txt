    "blue straggler stars ( hereafter bsss ) are core hydrogen - burning objects that , in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of globular clusters ( gcs ) and other stellar systems , populate a region along the extrapolation of the main sequence ( ms ) towards colors bluer than the turn - off point ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this observational evidence and direct measurements imply that the mass of bsss is larger ( in gcs , @xmath1 ; @xcite ) than that of typical stars ( @xmath2 in gcs ) .. ] in the last decades , the ratio between the number of bsss and that of a reference population ( as red giant or horizontal branch stars ) has been derived as a function of radius for more than @xmath3 galactic gcs and three different shapes of the bss radial distribution have been observed ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : a flat distribution ( with constant value throughout the cluster ) , a bimodal trend ( with a central peak , followed by a minimum and an outer rising branch ) and a unimodal behavior ( with a central peak and a monotonic decrease outward ) .",
    "some of the features of the observed bss radial distributions ( as the radial position of the minimum in the case of bimodal trends ) have been found to be well reproduced in terms of dynamical friction ( df ) effects , even if several simplifying assumptions were used to describe the process ( see * ? ? ?",

    "building on these considerations , @xcite proposed a comprehensive interpretative scenario identifying in the df process the primary cause of the whole variety of shapes of the observed bss radial distributions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "these authors linked the three classes of bss radial profiles to the cluster dynamical age , thus defining the so - called _ dynamical clock for gcs : a flat , bimodal , and unimodal bss radial distribution corresponds , respectively , to a dynamically - young , -intermediate , and -old cluster , with the position of the minimum of the distribution acting as a clock hand and marking the stage of internal dynamical evolution reached by the system .",
    "the idea behind this scenario is that the position of the minimum corresponds to the distance from the center where the df time ( @xmath0 ) equals the system age .",
    "since , in general , @xmath0 monotonically increases with radius , such a minimum is not yet dug in dynamically - young clusters ( with a flat bss distribution ) , it is found at intermediate radii in systems with intermediate dynamical age ( displaying a bimodal bss distribution ) , and it already reached the farthest outskirts in dynamically - old clusters ( characterized by a unimodal bss distribution ) . _    while the proposed scenario is simple and seems to properly account for the observational data , one can not exclude other more complicated , yet realistic , possibilities , given the intrinsic complexity of df .",
    "in particular the present study aims at answering the following question : _ could the df time - scale develop a non - monotonic radial behavior at some time during the cluster evolution ?",
    "_ in fact , if @xmath0 develops a minimum at a given radius @xmath4 , the bsss orbiting at that distance from the center would suffer from an enhanced drag force with respect to the other bsss orbiting at different radii , and a minimum in the bss radial distribution would therefore appear at @xmath4 ( i.e. , at a place and time different from what expected by the scenario depicted above , therefore affecting the possibility to use the distribution of bsss as a simple clock ) . note that , while @xmath0 is known to be a monotonically increasing function of radius in most of the astrophysical problematics investigated so far , this could not be the case for bsss in gcs , because of three combined conditions that could play a relevant role , namely : ( i ) a test particle only slightly more massive than the field objects , ( ii ) a background field made up of stars with different masses , and ( iii ) an evolving and radially dependent field mass function , due to the tendency to energy equipartition .",
    "in this paper we aim at investigating the possibility that @xmath0 is not a monotonic function of radius , by using direct n - body simulations and some analytical results pertinent to df in the presence of a mass spectrum .    in general terms",
    ", df can be described as the slowing - down of a body ( the _ test particle _ ) moving in a sea of background particles , due to the cumulative effect of long - range interactions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the processes underlying df have been studied notably by @xcite , in the case of a test particle moving in an infinite and homogeneous background field . in this view , df is interpreted as the result of the non - zero vectorial sum of the changes in the parallel component of the relative velocity caused by all the encounters of the test particle with the field particles ( each of them treated as an isolated two - body encounter ) , as a consequence of energy conservation on each relative orbit .",
    "remarkably , in the case of an isotropic velocity distribution function , and under the assumption of impulsive approximation , it can be shown that ( at the leading order ) only field particles moving slower than the test particle contribute to the deceleration of the test particle .",
    "many authors have extended the chandrasekhar s framework to other more realistic physical cases , with different assumptions or different and more sophisticated methods @xcite . from the astrophysical point of view , it is clear that df plays an important role on different scales , from galaxy clusters and their cd galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is clear that in the cases mentioned above the following assumptions are fully justified :    _ ( i ) _ the mass of the test particle is much larger than the mass of the field ones ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "this is a realistic situation , for example , when studying the sinking of gcs in galaxies ( @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are , respectively , the typical mass of gcs and that of a star in a galaxy ) .    _",
    "( ii ) _ the field particles all have the same mass .",
    "this assumption becomes realistic if the previous condition is verified : when the test particle is much more massive than the field ones , the background can be safely approximated by stars with mass equal to their average value .    clearly",
    "the case of bsss in gcs is a significant exception to points _ (",
    "i ) _ and _ ( ii ) _ , being the mass of the test particle only slightly ( 2 - 3 times ) larger than that of the field stars , so that taking into account a mass spectrum for the background can make significant differences .",
    "moreover , real gcs are composed of stars in a relatively large range of masses ( nominally from @xmath9 up to @xmath10 @xmath11 ) , then also assumption _ ( ii ) _ is not strictly valid .",
    "finally , it should be noticed that in general ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the ratio between the df and the two - body relaxation times is given by : @xmath12 .",
    "hence , while in the case of massive objects df effects manifest on time - scales shorter than the two - body relaxation time of the system ( @xmath13 ) , for comparable masses these effects occur on quite long times , with the tendency to mix with two - body relaxation time effects .",
    "all these considerations make the problem of modeling the df action in a gc more complex .    for the reasons",
    "above , it is not surprising that the case in which the field particles have a mass spectrum has not been extensively investigated in the literature .",
    "however , the considerations presented in @xcite for a homogeneous and infinite density background with a mass spectrum , coupled with the well known dynamical evolution of a multi - mass gc ( e.g. , @xcite ) , prompted us to investigate in more detail the problem .",
    "in fact , the dynamical evolution of the parent gc leads to a radially dependent stratification of masses for the background stars , so that in practice each radius is characterized by a different mass function , leading to a radially dependent df strength .",
    "moreover , it should be noted that , if a sort of equipartition is established in the background particles , then some additional non trivial effect due to their velocity distributions may take place ( @xcite , and sect .",
    "[ analytic ] ) .",
    "for example , in case of a bottom - heavy mass spectrum , on one side the low - mass population can have a higher density than that of high - mass stars ( thus providing a proportionally larger contribution to the total df ) , but , from the other side , the velocity of the light particles is also higher , so that their contribution to df is reduced , in a compensating effect .",
    "since df depends on the `` local '' conditions of the system , in terms of both density and velocity distribution , it is not trivial to predict the final effect on the test particle due to the interplay between the various mass - components in the cluster .",
    "furthermore , the dynamical evolution of a gc produces significant changes on these distributions in time ( e.g. , during and after the core - collapse stage ) , which , in turn , depend on the component stellar mass , too .",
    "hence the problem of modeling the df on ( the slightly heavier than average ) bsss in a dynamically evolving ( multi - mass ) gcs is a quite complex task .",
    "therefore , what really happens to the bbs population in a gc can be analyzed only by considering the combined effects , at each radius , of both a radially and a time dependent mass spectrum obtained ( for example ) by n - body simulations , in a self - consistent way .    within this context , we investigate here the multifaceted nature of df of test particles slightly heavier than average field particles in a dynamically evolving system with a mass spectrum , combining the approach described in @xcite with a set of numerical @xmath14-body simulations .",
    "the main goal is to verify whether in the presence of a multi - mass background , the df time - scale develops a non - monotonic radial behavior in some stages of the system evolution , that could provide an additional explanation to the observed variety of bss radial distributions .    in section [ analytic ]",
    "we introduce the analytic approach to the problem of df . in section [ nbody ] ,",
    "we outline the mono - mass and multi - mass @xmath14-body simulations used to describe the background field component .",
    "the results are discussed in section [ results ] and summarized in section [ summary ] .",
    "in order to introduce the case of a mass spectrum , we begin by recalling the relevant aspects of df in the standard case of a background made by identical scattering masses @xmath15 ; this case is a useful benchmark which allows to better identify the mass - spectrum effects on df .",
    "the deceleration of a test particle of mass @xmath16 , moving with speed @xmath17 and modulus @xmath18 in a homogeneous background of particles of equal mass @xmath15 , constant number density @xmath19 , and isotropic velocity distribution @xmath20 , under the effect of df can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the gravitational constant , @xmath23 is the fraction of particles slower than @xmath18 and @xmath24 is the _ velocity weighted coulomb logarithm _ @xcite . by definition , @xmath25 and @xmath26 : we recall that the sharp truncation of the function @xmath27 for velocities larger than @xmath18 is an approximation ( not affecting our discussion ) due to the assumption of velocity isotropy of the background and to the use of the lowest order term in the impulsive approximation adopted to compute the two - body interactions .",
    "it is well known that several problems affect the direct application of eq .",
    "( [ df ] ) to spherical systems , as a local description of df @xcite .",
    "nonetheless several studies have been based on the applications of eq .",
    "( [ df ] ) to spherical systems .    here",
    "we follow the same approach , for the case of interest ( i.e. , that of the evolution of the bss population of a gc ) , and take into account the radial dependence of the number density by replacing @xmath19 with @xmath28 .",
    "in addition , in all our discussion we assume the test particle to be on circular orbit in the gc potential well , so that also @xmath18 depends on @xmath29 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the total mass of the system enclosed within a sphere of radius @xmath29 . from these assumptions",
    ", it follows that also the function @xmath27 depends only on the radial distance from the center through @xmath32 and the local velocity distribution of the field particles . as usual , from eq .",
    "( [ df ] ) we can define the characteristic df times - scale as @xmath33 so that in our case @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the mass density of the background .",
    "this expression explicitly shows that the radial dependence of the df time - scale is shaped by three functions : the velocity of the test particle , @xmath32 , the mass density of the field stars , @xmath36 , and the relative number of stars moving slower than @xmath18 at any radius , @xmath37 . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect the possible dependence of @xmath38 on radius : at the present level of approximation this seems a reasonable assumption , due to the logarithmic nature of the associated term .",
    "note that the function @xmath37 is sometimes evaluated analytically by assuming a local maxwellian velocity distribution for the background particles , determined by the value of the local velocity dispersion ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "here however we avoid this additional assumption , as we compute the function @xmath37 directly by counting the number of particles moving slower than @xmath18 in the n - body simulation outputs ( see section [ nbody ] ) .",
    "as described in the introduction , this study is focused on the case of a system made by the superposition of different mass components , such as a gc with stars distributed according to a prescribed mass spectrum .",
    "@xcite showed that in such circumstances the df experienced by a test particle can be significantly different from that experienced in a single - mass background .",
    "therefore , the natural question arises of what happens in a gc , where the mass spectrum is associated to the initial mass function ( imf ) , and the dynamical evolution of the gc leads to a redistribution ( through the tendency to equipartition , e.g. @xcite ) of the density and velocity profiles of the different mass components . it is easy to realize that all these trends , weighted by the ratio between the mass of a bss and the mass of the field stars in each subcomponent of the cluster , could lead to a quite complicate radial trend of the total df .    in the presence of field particles with a mass spectrum ,",
    "the total df deceleration can be split in the individual contributions due to each single population .",
    "the @xmath39 population causes a deceleration of the test particle which is again expressed by eq .",
    "( [ df ] ) ; @xmath40 where now @xmath41 is the local density of the background component with stellar mass @xmath42 . due to the additive nature of scattering effects in the chandrasekhar treatment of df",
    ", the total deceleration is obtained from the sum of all the contributions . in particular , from eqs .",
    "( [ tdf_definizione ] ) and ( [ df_i ] ) it follows that : @xmath43 where @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ somma_armonica ] ) we assumed that the mass spectrum of the background stars is represented by the sum of a finite number of components ( @xmath45 ) . however eq . ( [ somma_armonica ] ) can be easily written as an integral in the case of a continuous mass spectrum @xcite . as a general comment ,",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ somma_armonica ] ) indicates that the local value of the df time is roughly determined by the smallest among the various @xmath46 .",
    "so far , the description in this section just reflects the `` standard '' approach to our problem : namely , one could construct an equilibrium model for a gc ( for example by solving numerically the poisson equation for one- and multi - component @xcite or @xcite models ) , take the radial profile of @xmath47 and the local velocity distribution and compute eq .",
    "( [ tdf_i ] ) . here ,",
    "we follow a more realistic approach , namely we make use of ( collisional ) n - body simulations of a set of mono- and multi - mass gc models , capable to provide us with the self - consistent radial behaviors of all the various quantities needed to evaluate eq .",
    "( [ tdf_i ] ) .",
    "this approach , at variance with the solution of the poisson problem , allows us to take into account also the time evolution of the @xmath0 radial profile .",
    "here we describe the set - up of the n - body simulations performed in order to determine the time evolution of the gc models hosting the bss population .",
    "since gcs are collisional systems , very accurate and specifically designed numerical methods are required to properly describe their time evolution . in practice , we use n - body simulations to obtain a self - consistent description of the phase - space density distribution of the different components of the gc , and then we apply the equations in section [ analytic ] to estimate the radial trend of @xmath0 .",
    "we also perform some simulation where the background stars are all characterized by the same mass , so that the effects of a mass spectrum can be better appreciated through comparison . for our simulations we used the direct @xmath14-body code @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "the simulations are not meant to describe the evolution of a gc from its formation to the present days .",
    "they just provide a simplified `` picture '' of a current gc , which could be in a pre- or in a post - core collapse phase .",
    "the mono - mass system is composed of @xmath48 particles with mass @xmath15 . the initial conditions ( particle positions and velocities ) have been generated from a king @xcite model with central dimensionless potential @xmath49 .",
    "we followed the dynamical evolution of the cluster up to a final time @xmath50 in n - body time units ( i.e. in units in which the total mass of the cluster is @xmath51 , @xmath52 and the total energy is @xmath53 ; ( see * ? ? ? * sect .",

    "@xmath58 so that in practice we follow the gc evolution up to @xmath59 . to improve the statistics , @xmath3 different sets of initial conditions have been generated by changing only the random seed from which the positions and velocities of the particles are extracted starting from the distribution function .",

    "this procedure generated `` _ supersnapshots _ '' containing @xmath60 particles .",
    "the simulations have been run on a dedicated workstation , and each simulation in the mono - mass case took approximately 3 hours ( thanks to the use of a gpu card ) .      as described in section 2.2 , in order to determine the time evolution of the radial trend of @xmath0 for the population of bss in a multi - mass gc , we need the distribution function of each stellar component of the cluster , i.e. , the associated density profile and its velocity distribution .",
    "of course , some educated guess could be used to describe the radial profile of the velocity distribution ( e.g. , to solve the associated jeans equations and use the resulting velocity dispersion in the local maxwellian approximation ) , but here we prefer to use direct n - body simulations that allow to compute in a self - consistent way the evolution of the structural and dynamical properties of the different components .",
    "the modelization of a mass - spectrum with a necessarily limited number of particles imposes some constrain in the choice of the number of mass bins .",
    "of course , the larger is the number of bins , the finer is the spectrum . however , to avoid too little numbers of particles in each bin as a consequence of an excessive partition among the field particles , as well as to understand more clearly the contribution of the various mass ranges ( at the various radii ) to the resulting df , we represent the mass spectrum as the superposition of three different populations with a total number of stars @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "the masses of the individual stars in each population are @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 respectively , with @xmath64 being the smallest value , @xmath67 and @xmath68",

    "this choice is a reasonable compromise between the description of a realistic case , and the need of a large statistical sampling for the less numerous population ( @xmath66 ) in order to avoid noise - dominated results ( see sect . [ summary ] for a discussion of the impact of such approximation on the results obtained ) .",

    "( [ tdf_radiale ] ) from the simulations , we considered equally populated radial bins ( i.e. , 100 concentric spherical shells , each enclosing @xmath87 particles of a given supersnapshot ) .",
    "this choice has the useful property of maintaining constant the error bars of the number density over the whole radial range , thus reducing the effects of random fluctuations .",
    "this choice also implies a finer sampling of the innermost regions as the time passes , because the density progressively increases in the core of the gc .",
    "the number density profile of the field component , @xmath28 , is then given by the number of particles in each radial bin divided by the volume of the shell .",
    "the circular velocity of the test particle , @xmath32 , is trivially computed by using eq .",
    "( [ circular ] ) . finally ,",
    "the local estimate of @xmath37 in each radial bin is obtained by normalizing the number of background particles in the given radial bin that are slower than @xmath32 , to the total number of background particle in the same bin .",
    "the resulting radial trend of @xmath0 at four representative times is shown in  [ fig1 ] , where the radial distance is expressed in units of the half - mass radius at that time @xmath88 , and the time is normalized to the _ instantaneous _ half - mass relaxation time , @xmath89 .",
    "[ fig1 ] clearly shows that @xmath0 maintains a monotonic radial trend at increasing time , in agreement with simple expectations .",
    "we see also that , as the dynamical evolution of the system proceeds , @xmath0 decreases ( i.e. , df becomes more efficient ) in the central and external regions , while the effect is opposite at intermediate radii .",
    "this behavior is mainly due to the time evolution of the mass density ( see  [ fig_rho ] ) , which progressively increases with time in the innermost and outermost regions , ( the former being due to the core - contraction , the latter due to the related cluster halo expansion ) , while it tends to decrease on the radial interval @xmath90 ( consistently with an evolution towards a higher cluster concentration , resulting in a decrease of @xmath91 ) .",
    "indeed the density profile is the primary driver of the shape of @xmath92 at all times , while the other terms entering eq .",
    "( [ tdf_radiale ] ) provide a negligible contribution .",
    "this is due to a more significant evolution of @xmath93 with respect to those of @xmath37 and @xmath94 , as is clearly apparent in  [ density_driver ] .",
    "therefore , the mono - mass simulations confirm the scenario adopted by @xcite to explain the different radial distributions of bsss as a function of the cluster age , due to the monotonic increase of the radius at which the cluster age coincides with @xmath92 .      in the multi - mass case ,",

    "the radial binning has been chosen by imposing that at least @xmath97 stars of mass @xmath66 are included in each shell and that the total number of bins is always @xmath98 .",

    "the velocity factors @xmath99 in each radial bin have been computed by normalizing the number of stars in the @xmath39 mass group that move slower than @xmath32 , to the total number of particles of the same mass group in that radial bin .",
    "the results obtained for the three considered values of the dimensionless potential ( @xmath100 ) and four different times are plotted in  [ single_tdf ] . in particular , we show @xmath92 at the initial time of the simulation ( @xmath101 ) and for three snapshots around the `` core - collapse time '' @xmath102 , defined as the time at which the lagrangian radius @xmath103 ( i.e. , the radius containing @xmath104 of the total mass ) reaches its minimum value . for reference , we notice that @xmath105 for @xmath84 , respectively . the radial behavior of the df time - scale is plotted both for each mass - component separately ( color lines ) , and combining the effects of the three background mass components according to eq .",

    "since the initial conditions for all mass - groups were built from the same king model properly scaled only for the adopted number of stars , at @xmath101 the radial profile of @xmath0 has the same qualitative behavior for any group and its value at any radial distance decreases for decreasing particle mass , because lighter stars are by far the most numerous and thus dominate the local mass density .    at all evolutionary times , as for the mono - mass simulations , also in this case",
    "the mass density is the main driver in shaping @xmath92 : the local value of @xmath92 is essentially determined by that of the dominant contributor to @xmath36 .",

    "the total mass density is mainly contributed by the heaviest mass - group at small radii , while it is dominated by the @xmath64 particles in the outskirts , and the radial profile of @xmath0 is thus driven by @xmath106 and @xmath107 in the two respective radial regions .",
    "in addition , from @xmath101 to @xmath108 , df becomes increasingly more efficient in the center ( i.e. , the value of @xmath0 at fixed small radii becomes smaller ) because also the central mass density increases , due to the segregation first of @xmath66 particles and then also of @xmath65 stars .",
    "the increase of @xmath92 at @xmath109 , is due to a late re - expansion of the system ( corresponding to a decrease of the mass density ) .",
    "[ single_tdf ] also shows that the radial profile of @xmath0 is qualitatively the same for all values of @xmath110 ( i.e. , independently of the cluster concentration ) and it always monotonically increases with radius , as in the mono - mass case .",
    "_ our simple analysis then shows that the presence of a mass spectrum does not induce non - monotonic behaviors in the df time - scale . _",
    "the previous analysis showed that a mass spectrum in a gc does not leads to a non - monotonic behavior of @xmath92 , so that the results are in qualitative agreement with the mono - mass case .",
    "but what about the absolute value of @xmath0 ?",
    "in fact , ciotti ( @xcite ) showed that a significant overestimate of the df time - scale can arise if approximating a multi - mass system with a single component only . in our case this check can be done by introducing the definition of the _ equivalent classical system _ ( ecs ) :    * the _ number _ density in the ecs is equal to the _ total _ number density of the multi - mass case : @xmath111 * the mass of the field particles in the ecs ( @xmath112 ) is equal to the _ average _ field mass of the multi - component case : @xmath113 where @xmath14 is the total number of stars in the multi - mass system ; * the velocity dispersion of the ecs is equal to the _ equipartition _ velocity of the multi - component case .",
    "the last property is non relevant in our case , since we compute the function @xmath37 directly from the simulation outputs , as the fraction of all the stars slower than the test particle . in order to compare the df time - scale obtained in the ecs approximation with the exact determination for the multi - mass case discussed in the previous section",
    ", we used eq .",
    "( [ tdf_radiale ] ) by assuming @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 . to compute @xmath31 entering the definition of @xmath18",
    ", we counted the number of particles with the radius @xmath29 and multiplied it by @xmath112 .",
    "the comparison between the df time - scale in the multi - mass and in the ecs cases for @xmath117 is shown in  [ ecs ] ( solid lines ) .",
    "as expected , no differences are found at @xmath101 , when mass - segregation has not played any role yet .",
    "this is due to the fact that the mass density is nearly the same in the two cases , because the three components have equal radial distributions and @xmath112 well corresponds to the true mean mass at all radii .",
    "when mass - segregation takes place , a systematic underestimate of df in the ecs case becomes apparent in the central regions , where @xmath0 can be almost a factor of @xmath118 larger than in the true multi - mass system .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the systematic underestimate of the ecs local mass density with respect to the multi - mass one .",
    "in fact , as a consequence of mass segregation , the number density at small radii is mainly contributed by the heaviest stars , and since @xmath66 is significantly larger than @xmath112 , the ecs mass density in these regions is considerably smaller than the multi - mass one .",
    "a smaller density implies a lower efficiency of df , thus bringing to larger values of @xmath0 in the ecs with respect to the multi - mass case . beyond the half - mass radius",
    ", the ratio between the values of @xmath0 in the two cases becomes nearly flat around @xmath119 .",
    "this is because beyond the half mass radius no appreciable mass - segregation has taken place during the simulated time , and so the local average mass is nearly equal to @xmath112 in that region , as in the initial conditions .    as a final test we modified the definition of ecs in requiring that the _ mass density _ in this approximation is equal to the true mass density of the multi - component system at any radius : @xmath120 as expected the difference between the two representations is considerably reduced and the underestimate of @xmath0 is about half that previously found ( see the dashed lines in  [ ecs ] ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that special attention should be paid to arguments based on specific requests about the value of @xmath0 , as estimate based on the average properties of the gc can be off by a factor of @xmath121 or @xmath118 , factors that are quite important for phenomena happening on time scales of the order of the hubble time .",
    "we studied the radial behavior of the df time - scale computed by following the chandrasekhar s formalism in a background of field particles with a `` simplified '' mass spectrum , evolved by means of direct and collisional n - body simulations .",
    "to our knowledge , this is the first numerical study of df in the presence of a self - consistently evolving field of particles with unequal masses and for a test star with a mass comparable to that of the field ( see @xcite for an analytical approach to the problem in the case of a spatially homogeneous background ) .",
    "we explored both the mono - mass case ( where all particles have unit mass and the test star decelerated by df is four times more massive ) , and the multi - mass case ( with three field components of masses @xmath122 , @xmath123 and total numbers @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and with the test particle having @xmath124 ) .",
    "each simulation was run with @xmath48 particles initially distributed as a spherical and isotropic king model with dimensionless potential @xmath125 in the mono - mass case , and @xmath126 in the multi - mass one . to improve the statistics , we combined @xmath3 simulations differing only for the seed used to generate the initial conditions .",
    "we find that the radial behavior of @xmath0 is always monotonic ( @xmath0 increasing with @xmath29 ) , both in the mono - mass background and in the presence of a mass spectrum , independently of the evolutionary time and the initial concentration of the system . in all cases ,",
    "the largely dominant factor in determining the shape of @xmath92 is the total mass density profile .",
    "we also find that approximating a multi - mass system as single - mass cluster ( made of stars with masses equal to the average particle mass ) can lead to a systematic overestimate of @xmath0 within the half - mass radius , up to a factor of 3 in the innermost regions , so that some care must be used when using the average properties of background populations to obtain quantitative estimates of @xmath127 .",
    "the @xmath128body simulations and the overall approach presented in this work are certainly a rough simplification of the much more complex problem of df in real gcs .",
    "first of all , the total number of simulated particles is much smaller than the number of stars in a cluster .",
    "however , while this affects the overall cluster evolution time - scale , it is not expected to impact our conclusions about the radial monotonicity of @xmath0 .",
    "the same considerations apply to the assumptions adopted for the mass spectrum ( only three bins with @xmath129 and @xmath130 ) : using a larger number of mass groups is not expected to induce a non - monotonic behavior on @xmath92 , since the density profile @xmath36 would still be a monotonic decreasing function of radius . adding a population of black holes , neutron stars and massive white dwarfs ( i.e. , stellar remnants more massive than bsss , which are certainly present in current gcs ) could make some difference , especially in the cluster central regions where they are expected to be concentrated because of mass segregation .",
    "however , given the uncertainties on their typical retention fraction , we preferred to neglect such a component in this first approach to the problem , postponing this issue to a future paper . in any case , still because @xmath131 , we do not expect that including massive dark remnants would modify our conclusions substantially .",
    "this also holds for the effect of an external tidal field , which is mainly expected to favor the evaporation of the lightest stars from the cluster outskirts .",
    "the impact of a population of primordial binaries and multiple systems , instead , is more difficult to predict ( especially if also bsss are modeled as binary systems ) and we plan to explore this problem in a forthcoming paper .    at least within the adopted approximations , the monotonic behavior found in all cases for @xmath92",
    "appears to be a quite solid result .",
    "we therefore conclude that , at present , the scenario proposed by @xcite , where @xmath92 is implicitly assumed to be monotonic at all times and df progressively affects larger clustercentric distances as a function of time , still appears to be the most likely explanation of the observed bss radial distributions , further confirming that these are a powerful empirical tool able to measure the dynamical age of stellar systems .",
