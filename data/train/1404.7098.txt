    "let @xmath0 denote the algebra of quaternions @xmath1 with the norm @xmath2 since the early days of quaternionic analysis , when the quaternionic analogue of complex holomorphic functions was introduced , there was a fundamental question about the natural quaternionic analogue of the ring structure of holomorphic functions .",
    "in particular , one can ask what is the quaternionic version of the ring of polynomials @xmath3 $ ] and laurent polynomials @xmath4 $ ] . the representation theoretic approach that we have developed in @xcite suggests the most naive candidates for an answer : @xmath0-valued polynomial functions on @xmath0 and @xmath5",
    "respectively : @xmath6 \\qquad \\text{and } \\qquad { \\mathbb}h[x^0,x^1,x^2,x^3,n(x)^{-1}].\\ ] ] another option is just to consider @xmath7-valued polynomial functions on @xmath0 and @xmath8 : @xmath9 \\qquad \\text{and } \\qquad { \\mathbb}r[x^0,x^1,x^2,x^3,n(x)^{-1}].\\ ] ] clearly , all four of these spaces of functions have natural ring structures .",
    "however , these functions are typically neither regular nor harmonic , so all the regular quaternionic structure is lost .",
    "representation theory asserts that all four quaternionic rings yield the so - called middle series of representations of the conformal lie algebra @xmath10 and that there are intertwining maps from tensor products of left regular and right regular polynomials into the two rings ( [ h - rings ] ) and from the tensor products of harmonic polynomials into the two rings ( [ r - rings ] ) .",
    "it is also natural to complexify the quaternions @xmath11 and the spaces of polynomial functions on them ( [ h - rings ] ) and ( [ r - rings ] ) .",
    "this brings us to the main objects of our study : @xmath12 ,   \\label{1 } \\\\ { \\cal w } & = { { \\mathbb}h_{{\\mathbb}c}}[z^0,z^1,z^2,z^3,n(z)^{-1 } ] , \\label{2 } \\\\ { \\textit{{{\\fontencoding{ot2}\\fontfamily{wncyr}\\selectfont zh}}}}^+ & = { \\mathbb}c [ z^0,z^1,z^2,z^3 ] , \\label{3 } \\\\ { \\textit{{{\\fontencoding{ot2}\\fontfamily{wncyr}\\selectfont zh}}}}&= { \\mathbb}c [ z^0,z^1,z^2,z^3,n(z)^{-1 } ]   \\label{4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]  the two versions of the rings of ordinary and laurent polynomials in one complex variable .",
    "the relation between the quaternionic ring ( [ 3 ] ) and harmonic functions yields a reproducing integral formula for functions in @xmath13 . on the other hand ,",
    "the relation between the ring ( [ 1 ] ) and the regular functions is similar , but instead of a reproducing formula we get an integral expression for a certain second order differential operator @xmath14 ( the operator @xmath15 is directly related to the solutions of the maxwell equations for the gauge potential . ) all of these formulas can be regarded as quaternionic analogues of the cauchy s formula for the second order pole @xmath16 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the corresponding formulas for @xmath17 and @xmath18 are more involved and are the main subject of this paper .",
    "they require certain regularizations of infinities which are well known in four - dimensional quantum field theory as `` vacuum polarizations '' in spinor and scalar cases respectively .",
    "they are usually encoded by the feynman diagrams shown in figure [ vpolar - diag ] and play a key role in renormalization theory ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "0.25     0.25     in order to explain our reproducing formula in the scalar case , we recall the space @xmath19 of harmonic functions on @xmath8 .",
    "it decomposes into two irreducible components : @xmath20 with respect to the action of the conformal algebra @xmath21 .",
    "similarly , we can decompose @xmath18 into three irreducible components : @xmath22 the spaces @xmath13 and @xmath23 have already appeared in @xcite , but the appearance of @xmath24 in quaternionic analysis is new .",
    "we study equivariant embeddings of @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath13 into tensor products @xmath25 .",
    "the cases @xmath23 and @xmath13 are fairly straightforward , but the case of @xmath24  which is the core of the scalar vacuum polarization  is more subtle . as a consequence of these equivariant embeddings , we obtain projectors of @xmath18 onto its irreducible components . using these projectors",
    "we get a reproducing formula for all functions in @xmath18 , which may be loosely stated as follows .",
    "let @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are two certain open regions in @xmath29 both having @xmath30 as their shilov boundary",
    ". then @xmath31 ( see remark [ reproducing - remark ] ) .",
    "a similar formula can be deduced for the operator @xmath15 acting on @xmath17 .",
    "the treatment of the projector onto @xmath24 and the resulting reproducing formula are not completely satisfactory , since the points @xmath32 and @xmath33 belong to the non - intersecting domains @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "this phenomenon is well known in physics , where it results in the divergence of the feynman integral corresponding to the scalar vacuum polarization diagram .",
    "physicists have several methods to achieve this isolation of singularity involving introduction of an auxiliary parameter .",
    "depending on the method , this auxiliary parameter can be interpreted as dimension or mass .",
    "the former method is incompatible with representation theoretic approach and the latter is better from our point of view , but still breaks the conformal symmetry down to the famous poincare group .",
    "there is , however , a third way to introduce an auxiliary parameter while fully preserving the conformal invariance ",
    "namely via anti de sitter deformation of the flat minkowski space . this is the method we pursue in the second part of the paper to develop a deformation of quaternionic analysis .",
    "first of all , we define a one - parameter family of conformal laplacians @xmath34 depending on a real parameter @xmath35 , where @xmath36 denotes the degree operator plus identity and @xmath37 is the ordinary laplacian on @xmath0 . as usual , the deformed laplacian admits a quaternionic factorization into two first order differential operators @xmath38 where the arrows indicate that the operator @xmath39 is applied to functions on the left and @xmath40 is applied on the right .",
    "this factorization allows us to define a one - parameter family of left and right regular functions by the requirement @xmath41 then we prove analogues of cauchy - fueter and poisson formulas as well as generalize certain other constructions and results from quaternionic analysis .",
    "in particular , the poisson kernel @xmath42 is replaced by the following family of kernels depending on @xmath35 @xmath43 where @xmath44 and the 5-dimensional space @xmath45 is equipped with an indefinite inner product @xmath46 @xmath47 , @xmath48 . after developing basics of the anti de sitter deformation of quaternionic analysis we turn to the treatment of the second order pole .",
    "as the expression for the reproducing kernel ( [ k - intro ] ) indicates , various one - parameter generalizations of results from quaternionic analysis admit a natural geometric interpretation when we identify the space of quaternions with a single sheet of a two - sheeted hyperboloid in @xmath45 .",
    "this hyperboloid is known to physicists as the anti de sitter space .",
    "thus the anti de sitter space - time geometry  which has been extensively studied by physicists ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein )  naturally provides a one - parameter deformation of ( classical ) quaternionic analysis .",
    "we obtain , in particular , a deformation of the representations @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 of the conformal lie algebra and find projectors onto these spaces .",
    "this brings us back to our original motivation of the one - parameter deformation of quaternionic analysis  finding a representation - theoretic interpretation of the regularization in quantum field theory .",
    "this question will be addressed in a subsequent work .",
    "the paper consists of two parts related by a common motivation of development of quaternionic analysis using representation - theoretic methods . in sections [ preliminaries - section]-[m - section ] we study structures related to the second order pole and in sections [ ads - section]-[zh_mu - section ]",
    "we develop the one - parameter deformation of quaternionic analysis using geometry of the anti de sitter space . in section [ preliminaries - section ]",
    "we summarize the results of quaternionic analysis that are used in this article and , in particular , introduce the representation @xmath52 of the conformal algebra @xmath53 which is one of the main subject of this work . in section [ k - type - section ] we give explicit @xmath54-types of @xmath52 , and in section [ irred - section ] we show that the representation @xmath52 decomposes into three irreducible components ( [ zh - decomp - intro ] ) ( theorem [ zh - decomposition ] ) .",
    "we also prove that the subspaces @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath13 are the images under the natural multiplication maps of , respectively , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( lemma [ image - lemma ] ) . in section",

    "we prove analogues of the cauchy s theorem and the cauchy - fueter formula in the deformed setting ( corollary [ cauchy ] and theorem [ cauchy - fueter-5 ] ) .",
    "finally , in section [ zh_mu - section ] we introduce a deformation @xmath66 of the space @xmath18 associated with the second order pole , similarly to ( [ zh - decomp - intro ] ) , decompose it into a direct sum @xmath67 and obtain projectors onto these direct summands .",
