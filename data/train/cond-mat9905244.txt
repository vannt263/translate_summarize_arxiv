    "stable quasicrystalline phases are typically found in binary mixtures @xcite , where the various arrangements of the two components contribute to the degeneracy of the local environments @xcite , allowing a quasicrystalline phase to be entropy stabilized @xcite . with one notable exception @xcite , previous studies did not support the existence of a stable quasicrystalline phase in a monodisperse system interacting with a simple potential @xcite .",
    "we study a simple model that allows us to estimate the crystal and quasicrystal entropies and thereby study the helmholtz potentials of the crystals and quasicrystal .",
    "the ground state of this system is a periodic crystal , yet we explore the possibility that the quasicrystalline configuration is the equilibrium state in a certain temperature regime .",
    "although quasicrystals do not have short range order , they do have recurring local environments that , in our model , resemble the basic cells of the stable crystalline phases . from the entropies of the stable crystalline phases and by estimating the configurational entropy of the quasicrystal",
    ", we infer that the quasicrystal may be an equilibrium state .",
    "we observe sharpening of five fold diffraction peaks when the starting amorphous phase is annealed . in two dimensions ,",
    "five fold diffraction peaks pertain to crystallographically disallowed point groups which characterize quasicrystals @xcite .",
    "to study quasicrystalline stability in a monodisperse system , we perform molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of a two - dimensional model of hard spheres interacting with an attractive square - well ( sw ) potential [ fig .",
    "[ sw_pot ] ] .",
    "the simplicity of this sw potential allows us to study the fundamental characteristics of the system . by tuning the width of the sw potential",
    ", we can control the local geometric configurations formed by the particles .",
    "the structures of the crystalline and quasicrystalline phases can thus be clearly defined and analyzed .",
    "we perform md simulations in the nvt ensemble , using a standard collision event list algorithm @xcite to evolve the system , while we use a method similar to the berendsen method to achieve the desired temperature @xcite .",
    "the depth of the potential well is @xmath0 .",
    "energies are measured in units of @xmath1 , temperature is measured in units of energy divided by the boltzmann constant , @xmath2 , and the mass of the particle is @xmath3 .",
    "we choose the value of the hard core distance to be , @xmath4 , and the ratio of the attractive distance @xmath5 to the hard core distance @xmath6 , to be @xmath7 .",
    "since the diagonal distance between two corners of a square is @xmath8 times the length of one side , choosing @xmath7 favors the formation of a square crystal lattice where each particle interacts with 8 neighbors [ fig .",
    "[ 3xtals]a ] .",
    "this constraint inhibits the formation of a triangular crystal , which would form at low temperatures if @xmath9 or at high densities .",
    "studying the behavior of the system at low temperatures we observe the formation of local structures similar to that shown in fig .  [",
    "these structures constitute local environments @xcite that can reproduce crystallographically allowed symmetry if translationally ordered .",
    "first , we consider the stable periodic crystal phases produced by translationally ordering each of the configurations in fig .  [ 3xtals ] and calculate the energies of these crystal structures at @xmath10 . in our system ,",
    "the two allowed local configurations are the 4-particle square and the 5-particle pentagon ( indicated by the symbol `` p '' in fig .",
    "[ 3xtals]b , c ) .",
    "particles form these two geometries because the nearest neighbor diagonal and adjacent distance between particles in these configurations is less than @xmath7 , the sw width .",
    "four particle squares make up the square crystal ; since each particle has @xmath11 neighbors , at @xmath10 , the potential energy per particle is @xmath12 .",
    "pentagons do not tile the plane ; however , the formation of two kinds of crystals based on the local five particle pentagon is possible . in the type",
    "i pentagonal crystal , each crystalline cell consists of @xmath13 particles , one of which has @xmath11 neighbors and four of which have @xmath14 neighbors ; hence , @xmath15 [ fig .",
    "[ 3xtals]b ] . in the type ii pentagonal crystal , each crystalline cell consists of @xmath16 particles , two of which have @xmath11 neighbors and @xmath17 of which have @xmath14 neighbors ; hence , @xmath18 [ fig .",
    "[ 3xtals]c ] . since @xmath19",
    ", at our chosen density and low enough temperatures , the type i pentagonal crystal should be the stable phase at @xmath10 [ fig .",
    "[ fe ] ] .",
    "next , we investigate the stability of the three crystalline phases at @xmath20 by estimating the helmholtz potential per particle @xmath21 in the square crystal and in the pentagonal crystals of type i and type ii . here",
    "@xmath22 is the entropy .",
    "since our simulations are performed at constant density , we must use the helmholtz potential instead of the gibbs potential .",
    "we study the system at dimensionless number density @xmath23 .",
    "we have simulated a square crystal with n=961 , a pentagonal crystal type i with n=1040 , and a pentagonal crystal type ii with n=792 , all at the same @xmath24 .",
    "we checked that at low temperatures , @xmath25 , the potential energy @xmath26 is temperature independent , and has the same value as the potential energy of the ideal crystal at @xmath10 .",
    "hence , we approximate @xmath26 at higher @xmath27 by @xmath28 .    in order to plot the behavior of the helmholtz potentials of the three crystals for @xmath29",
    ", we find the entropic contributions @xmath22 , by estimating the entropy per particle for each of the three crystal types .",
    "we use the probability density @xmath30 to find a particle at position @xmath31 , where the average is taken over every particle in the crystalline cell :    @xmath32    we estimate @xmath30 by the fraction of the total time @xmath33 spent by a particle in a discretized area , @xmath34 , at a low enough temperature that the potential energy fluctuations of the crystalline structure are negligible .",
    "the values of the entropies for the three crystals are given in table i.    our estimates for the temperature dependence of the helmholtz potential for the three types of crystals are given in fig .",
    "the condition for stability of the pentagonal crystals is that their helmholtz potentials , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , are lower than the helmholtz potential of the square crystal , @xmath37 . in accord with this condition ,",
    "the square crystal is stable at temperatures above @xmath38 , the type ii pentagonal crystal is stable between @xmath39 and @xmath38 and the type i pentagonal crystal is stable below @xmath39 .    while studying the interesting region around @xmath40",
    "( see fig  [ fe ] ) , we observe the formation of the quasicrystal .",
    "we choose to investigate , using md simulations , our system at @xmath40 because this is the temperature regime where the three crystals have similar values of helmholtz potential .",
    "cooling the fluid phase , we find the formation of the square crystal below @xmath41 .",
    "however , when further cooled into the temperature regime where the helmholtz potentials of the two pentagonal crystals are lower than the helmholtz potential of the square crystal , the system does not form pentagonal crystal i or pentagonal crystal ii ( within our simulation times ) , but remains as the square crystal .",
    "hence , we use a different approach to try to form the pentagonal crystals : we heat an amorphous phase .",
    "we first form the amorphous phase by quenching the system from high to very low temperatures @xmath42 . to do this ,",
    "we study a system of @xmath43 @xcite particles at @xmath44 which is initially in the fluid phase at high temperature , @xmath45 .",
    "we quench this system to @xmath46 and thermalize for @xmath47 time units @xcite .",
    "time constraints prevent us from studying systems with more than 961 particles .",
    "long thermalization times are required to stabilize thermodynamic observables like energy and pressure .",
    "the amorphous phase is a homogeneous mixture of pentagons and squares [ fig .",
    "[ diff - fig]a ] .",
    "the lack of long range structural order in the amorphous phase is evident from the homogeneity of the circles in the isointensity plot [ fig .",
    "[ diff - fig]b ] .",
    "when heating the amorphous phase@xcite to temperatures above @xmath48 , we find that diffusion becomes sufficient for local rearrangement to occur , and the pentagons begin to coalesce . instead of forming type i or ii pentagonal crystals ,",
    "the pentagons begin to form rows [ fig .",
    "[ diff - fig]c ] that bend at angles which are multiples of 36@xmath49 .",
    "the angle in the bending of the rows gives rise to the five - fold orientational symmetry , which corresponds to the ten easily observed peaks in the isointensity plot [ fig .",
    "[ diff - fig]d ] .",
    "these 10 peaks are characteristic of the quasicrystal phase @xcite , as they are arranged with disallowed fifth order point group symmetry @xcite .",
    "the configuration that we obtain has defects , mainly patches of square crystal , which cause the discontinuity in the rows and lead to the broadening of the diffraction peaks . for comparison ,",
    "we present in fig .  [ pxtals - fig ] the isointensity plots of the simulated square and pentagonal crystals .",
    "the diffraction patterns illustrate the symmetry of the original crystal system .",
    "the four equal sides of the square crystal unit cell [ fig  [ 3xtals]a ] are clear in the symmetry of the isointensity plot fig .  [ pxtals - fig ] . in the isointensity plot of pentagonal crystal i [ fig .",
    "[ pxtals - fig]b ] , the central region which corresponds to the long range order , shows no hints of anything but well defined centered - rectangular symmetry [ fig  [ 3xtals]b ] @xcite .",
    "the isointensity plot of pentagonal crystal ii has mainly a rectangular symmetry that matches the rectangular symmetry of the unit cells [ fig  [ 3xtals]c ] .",
    "although the two pentagonal crystals are formed from ordered pentagons , their long range symmetries are four sided .",
    "their corresponding isointensity plots illustrate these four fold symmetries which are distinctly different from the five fold quasicrystal isointensity plot .",
    "since the phase transition between the two pentagonal crystals occurs at @xmath40 , we choose this temperature as the one to investigate for quasicrystal formation . after the amorphous phase",
    "is quenched to t=0.1 , we anneal the system at @xmath50 , for @xmath51 time units , and calculate the diffusion coefficient @xmath52 , pressure @xmath53 @xcite and potential energy @xmath54 .",
    "we calculate @xmath52 using the einstein relation @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the system dimension . after a short initial period of increase",
    ", we observe that @xmath52 and @xmath54 decrease with time and reach plateaus [ fig .",
    "[ plateau ] ] .",
    "the diffusion coefficient approaches zero , which is consistent with the possible formation of a quasicrystal phase .",
    "the isointensity peaks also sharpen with the duration of annealing . due to md time constraints , we are not sure that we reach the potential energy of a perfect quasicrystal , which is expected to be comparable to the energies , @xmath57 and @xmath18 , of the pentagonal crystals . the lowest potential energy reached is @xmath58 .",
    "we observe the spontaneous formation of the quasicrystal phase in the range of temperatures between @xmath59 and @xmath50 . as we heat either the amorphous phase or the quasicrystal above @xmath60 , the square crystal forms , consistent with the helmholtz potential estimations of fig .",
    "[ fe ] .",
    "next we address the question of whether the quasicrystal phase is stable , by comparing the values of the helmholtz potential for the three crystal types . as can be seen [ fig .",
    "[ diff - fig]c , d ] , the structure of the quasicrystal arises from the bending rows of pentagons which locally resemble the pentagonal crystals of either type i or ii . we assume that local arrangements of particles corresponding to a square crystal are defects @xcite that would be absent in the perfect quasicrystal .",
    "if we assume that the local arrangement of the quasicrystal is similar to a combination of the local arrangements in the pentagonal crystal i and the pentagonal crystal ii , we can approximate the helmholtz potential of the quasicrystal by the average helmholtz potential of the two pentagonal crystals . because the quasicrystals have a positive entropy contribution to the total entropy due to their degeneracy @xcite , we add an additional term @xmath61 to the original estimate of the helmholtz potential energy . here",
    "@xmath62 is the entropy due to the possible configurations of the quasicrystal .",
    "we estimate @xmath62 as the logarithm of the number of configurations formed by @xmath63 pentagons in the quasicrystal .",
    "a single pentagon can be oriented in two possible ways when attached side by side to an existing row of pentagons . neglecting the interaction between adjacent rows",
    ", we can estimate the upper bound for the number of configurations as @xmath64 , where @xmath63 is the total number of pentagons in the quasicrystal .",
    "note that at point a on fig .",
    "[ fe ] , the helmholtz potentials of both pentagonal crystals coincide , so an additional @xmath61 term should stabilize the quasicrystal in the vicinity of point a.    to better estimate @xmath65 , we notice that the bending rows of pentagons forming the quasicrystal resemble a compact self - avoiding random walk on the hexagonal lattice .",
    "the number of such walks grows as @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath63 is the number of steps @xcite .",
    "since the formation of one pentagon in the midst of a perfect square crystal lowers the energy of the system by @xmath68 , we estimate @xmath63 to be @xmath69 . assuming that the ground state energy of the quasicrystal is between @xmath70 and @xmath71 , the number of pentagons in the quasicrystal , should not be smaller than the number of pentagons in the crystal of type ii ( which is the pentagonal crystal with the lesser number of pentagons and has @xmath72 ) .",
    "we estimate the entropy of configuration per particle to be @xmath73 .",
    "thus , the quasicrystal should be more stable than the pentagonal crystals between @xmath74 and @xmath75 , where the gap between the helmholtz potential of the pentagonal crystals is smaller than the configuration term @xmath76 which ranges from @xmath77 to @xmath78 in the interval where @xmath27 increases from @xmath79 to @xmath80 . since the @xmath76 term lowers the helmholtz potential of the obtained quasicrystal configuration below the helmholtz potentials of the two pentagonal crystals , it is likely that the obtained state with five - fold rotational symmetry is not the coexistence of type i and ii pentagonal crystals , but is a stable quasicrystalline phase",
    ". a more rigorous investigation of this problem would either require the construction of a perfect penrose tiling @xcite or of a random tiling @xcite involving the local structures of crystals type i and ii .",
    "to summarize , perfect pentagonal crystals of type i and ii do not form spontaneously during the time scales of our study .",
    "instead , the quasicrystal , having long - range , five - fold orientational order with no translational order , forms from the coalescence of pentagons present in the starting amorphous phase .",
    "the starting amorphous configuration must initially be quenched at a low enough temperature in order to prevent crystallization to the square phase .",
    "moreover , the amorphous phase must be carefully thermalized at the quench temperature , as we have observed that , upon heating a poorly equilibrated amorphous phase with a higher concentration of squares , the system phase separates into regions of pentagons and squares .",
    "if the starting amorphous phase does not have a sufficient concentration of pentagons , the quasicrystal will not form : large regions of square crystal will inhibit the long range order of pentagons and thus not give rise to the 10 diffraction peaks in the isointensity plot .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the bending rows observed in our quasicrystal could resemble the stripe structure of a spinodal decomposition @xcite .",
    "anyhow , in the case of spinodal decomposition , the diffraction pattern would be similar to that of an amorphous structure .    before concluding , we note that jagla , using monte carlo simulations , recently reported the existence of quasicrystals in a two - dimensional , monodisperse system of hard spheres interacting with a _ purely repulsive potential _ @xcite .",
    "the quasicrystal we observe has a different structure from that modeled by jagla : our quasicrystal is not a ground state structure and forms only at nonzero temperature .",
    "also , formation of quasicrystals in monodisperse systems has been observed using complex radially symmetric potentials both in two dimensions @xcite and three dimensions @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , the quasicrystal found in our simulations",
    "has a structure different from those previously studied .",
