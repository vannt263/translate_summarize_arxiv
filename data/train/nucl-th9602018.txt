    "scaling behaviors of hadronic observables in quark - hadron transition ( pt ) have been studied in the framework of ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory @xcite-@xcite .",
    "since it is a mean - field theory , it can not account for the dynamical fluctuations that can occur in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "an attempt to amend that defect has been made by treating the problem in the ising model , so that by lattice simulation the effect of spatial fluctuation of hadron density at the surface of quark - gluon plasma can be considered @xcite . in this paper",
    "we treat the problem of spatial fluctuation in a very different way .",
    "we generalize the gl description of second - order pt in @xmath1 by including a term that accounts for surface fluctuation .",
    "the deviation from a flat surface is simulated by use of a term in the free energy that represents the confining potential between quarks . by associating bulges on the surface to regions where hadronization can take place more readily , we can determine the effect of spatial fluctuations on the hadronic observables .",
    "thus this work represents a significant step toward making the gl formalism a more realistic description of the pt problem in heavy - ion collisions .    in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite it has been found that the scaling behavior characteristic of the pt is associated with the normalized factorial moments @xmath2 . actually , that scaling behavior does not exhibit intermittency @xcite , which is the power law @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the number of bins in a fixed volume of phase space . instead of @xmath4 scaling , which we use to refer to the @xmath5 behavior , we have found that pure gl leads to @xmath0 scaling , which is @xmath6 when @xmath4 is varied .",
    "furthermore , @xmath7 satisfies the simple formula @xcite @xmath8 it is this @xmath9 that has been referred to as the scaling exponent .",
    "it is not to be confused with the conventional critical indices in statistical physics , to which @xmath9 bears absolutely no relationship . in problems where the temperature @xmath10 is not observable , but the multiplicities of particles produced are ( such as photons in lasers @xcite and pions in heavy - ion collisions @xcite ) , @xmath0 scaling has been found to be the only scaling behavior that can be put to experimental tests .",
    "thus far the value of @xmath9 at @xmath11 has proven to be remarkably universal theoretically , and has been verified experimentally to be accurate in quantum optics @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall check whether @xmath0 scaling remains valid when spatial fluctuations are taken into account , and if so , whether @xmath12 is still true .",
    "we give first a very brief review of the usual method in the gl approach to hadronic observables @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the multiplicity distribution @xmath13 is expressed as a functional integral @xmath14 where @xmath15 , and the gl free energy is @xmath16 here the spatial integration is over a @xmath1 space , which may be taken to be the surface of the cylinder containing quark - gluon plasma . when the surface temperature @xmath10 , on which the parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 in ( [ 4 ] ) depend , is low enough ,",
    "hadrons are formed on that surface and are removed from the confining medium that exists within . if the integration in @xmath20 is limited to a small bin of size @xmath21 , then the @xmath21-dependence of @xmath13 can best be determined in terms of @xmath2 , where @xmath22 the average being defined by use of the distribution @xmath13 .",
    "it is this @xmath2 that has the scaling properties ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) .    in most treatments @xcite-@xcite the third term in ( [ 4 ] ) is neglected .",
    "its inclusion is considered by hwa and pan @xcite , and is found to lead to only a small change in the value of @xmath9 .",
    "our approach here is to replace that term by another that has explicit spatial dependence with dynamical origin .",
    "but before embarking on that , let us rewrite the formalism in a more compact way .",
    "if we write ( [ 5 ] ) in the form @xmath23 then we have @xmath24 where @xmath25 is proportional to @xmath26 , and @xmath27 without the last term of ( [ 4 ] ) , @xmath28 may be regarded as constant inside @xmath21 so the last expression in ( [ 8 ] ) follows . with the interpretation of @xmath29 as the hadron density , an order parameter , we may regard @xmath30 as the `` dynamical '' multiplicity in a bin of area @xmath21 . the statistical fluctuation represented by the poissonian factors in front of @xmath31 in ( [ 3 ] )",
    "is removed by taking the factorial moment , so that the series in terms of the `` experimental '' multiplicity @xmath32 in ( [ 7 ] ) is replaced by the integral over the `` dynamical '' multiplicity @xmath30 , which need not be an integer .",
    "@xmath33 has multiplicative factors that are cancelled by the same factors in @xmath34 , when the ratio in ( [ 6 ] ) is taken . leaving out those factors , we can write @xmath33 more transparently as @xmath35 , \\label{9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 pt occurs when @xmath37 , so @xmath38 is always positive in the following consideration .",
    "note that @xmath17 is dimensionless , while @xmath18 has the dimension of area .",
    "thus the physical @xmath21 always appears in the ratio @xmath39 , i.e. , in the gl description the area is measured in units of @xmath18 .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that @xmath2 is a function of only one composite variable , @xmath40 . in the following because of our way of introducing spatial fluctuations",
    ", there will be seperate dependences on @xmath17 and @xmath39 .",
    "hence , ( [ 9 ] ) will be our starting point , when there is no spatial fluctuation .    to introduce surface fluctuations ,",
    "let us first map the @xmath1 surface to a square lattice of size @xmath41 , on which we impose periodic boundary condition . with bins of size @xmath42 , there are @xmath43 bins on the lattice .",
    "at each lattice site we assign a variable @xmath44 that represents the vertical displacement from the flat surface at site @xmath45 .",
    "we restrict @xmath44 to be in the range @xmath46 , deferring the physical scale of perpendicular displacement to another parameter to be introduced below .",
    "zero displacement is defined by the global constraint @xmath47 where the sum is over all sites on the lattice .",
    "the physics governing the @xmath48-displacement is color confinement . in the discretization of the physical space",
    "we do not mean that the lattice spacing is to be identified with the actual average distance between partons on the surface of the plasma .",
    "the lattice is a coarse - grain representation of the surface , and we let each site carry the net color charge of the basic cell ( of area lattice - spacing squared ) surrounding the site . for brevity",
    "we call such a color charge at the site a quark .",
    "our aim is to simulate vertical fluctuations of the surface . with the lattice spacing being fixed",
    ", the vertical displacement of a site relative to its neighbors represents further separation among the quarks .",
    "since energy is required to increase the quark separation , we add a term to the free energy to inhibit vertical displacement , calling it @xmath49 to represent spatial contribution , @xmath50 where the sum is over the nearest neighbors @xmath51 of each site @xmath45 , and then over all @xmath45 .",
    "the confinement parameter @xmath52 includes the @xmath53 factor , as in ( [ 4 ] ) , and the scale factor for perpendicular displacement mentioned earlier .",
    "the @xmath54 dependence represents the linearly increasing portion of the confinement potential .",
    "the @xmath55 coulombic portion is omitted partly because the lattice spacing imposes a minimum distance between quarks that prevents @xmath56 from becoming small , and partly because we want to avoid introducing another parameter . in place of the last term of ( [ 4 ] ) , @xmath49 as given in ( [ 12 ] ) provides a sensible description of spatial dependence of the energy of the system that incorporates the color dynamics into the gl formalism .",
    "a key link yet to be specified is the way in which @xmath44 is related to the order parameter @xmath57 or the dynamical multiplicity @xmath30 .",
    "our procedure is to use the boltzmann factor exp(@xmath58 ) to simulate a configuration of @xmath44 throughout the lattice . clearly , because of thermal fluctuation the vertical displacement need",
    "not be @xmath59 for all @xmath45 , even though that is the most favored configuration . because of ( [ 11 ] ) there are as many net positive displacements as there are negatives on the lattice .",
    "however , as we focus on a particular bin of area @xmath42 , there may be a nonvanishing displacement for the bin @xmath60 we identify a positive @xmath61 as having a net outward protrusion of the surface at the bin , and a negative @xmath61 as having a net inward indentation .",
    "nucleation dynamics suggests that hadronization is more likely to occur at the location of protruding surface and less likely at where the surface is indented .",
    "thus given a value of @xmath57 for a bin , the dynamical multiplicity should deviate from @xmath30 in a way that is proportional to @xmath61 .",
    "that is , we should consider a convolution @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the gl term given by the exponential in ( [ 9 ] ) , and @xmath64 represents the spatial fluctuation specified by @xmath65 , yet to be determined , which describes the probability that a bin has a net vertical displacement @xmath61 .",
    "more precisely , we upgrade ( [ 9 ] ) to include spatial fluctuations by writing @xmath66 where the dynamical distribution @xmath67 is @xmath68 and @xmath69 . \\label{16}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the next section we shall determine the distribution in @xmath61 . what remains to be specified",
    "is the relationship between @xmath61 and hadron multiplicity . without getting involved with the details of nucleation , surface tension , etc .",
    ", let us introduce a new parameter @xmath70 that summarizes all the dynamical details relating vertical surface displacement to multiplicity fluctuation , @xmath71 , so that @xmath72 recall that @xmath30 is the mean multiplicity in the gl theory .",
    "the spatial fluctuation of the multiplicity distribution , @xmath73 , to be determined in the next section is what appears in ( [ 15 ] ) for the net dynamical distribution @xmath67 .",
    "our first task is to reproduce to gl result @xcite ( without surface fluctuation ) by lattice simulation . in the analytical method used in @xcite ,",
    "there is only one composite variable , @xmath74 , that @xmath2 depends on .",
    "@xmath0 scaling is found to hold in the range @xmath75 , which corresponds roughly to @xmath76 . from fig .  1 of @xcite",
    "one can see that such ranges of @xmath2 are for @xmath77 in the range @xmath78 .",
    "since @xmath77 is a composite variable , it does not matter how @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath21 are separately varied .",
    "phenomenologically , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are not under experimental control , so @xmath21 must be varied in the appropriate range such that the data on @xmath2 are in the range that exhibits @xmath0 scaling .",
    "now , on the lattice we must work with specific bin sizes @xmath79 .",
    "that necessity destroys the advantage of dealing with just one @xmath77 variable in the analytic method .",
    "we make the identification @xmath80 and choose a range of @xmath79 that can cover the scaling range in @xmath77 mentioned above , i.e. , @xmath81 . the ratio of the extrema of that @xmath77 range corresponds , for @xmath17 held constant , to the ratio of the extrema of @xmath79 being very nearly @xmath82 .",
    "thus , if we let the smallest bin to consist of just two sites in each direction , then the range of @xmath79 should be @xmath83 .",
    "choosing the lattice size to be @xmath84 , we have for the number of bins , @xmath4 , on the lattice to vary from @xmath85 down to @xmath86 , a range that is wide enough to test scaling . the corresponding value of @xmath17 is roughly @xmath87 .    applying the above parameters to ( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) , and using monte carlo method to calculate @xmath33 and",
    "then @xmath2 , we find the result in fig .  1 shown in log - log plot .",
    "the linear dependences for @xmath88 confirm the @xmath0-scaling behavior .",
    "moreover , the scaling exponent @xmath9 defined in ( [ 2 ] ) is found to be @xmath89 , as shown in fig .  2 , in essential agreement with the result obtained in @xcite , as it should .",
    "proceeding now to the main task of including spatial fluctuations , we start by setting @xmath90 in ( [ 12 ] ) initially . other values of @xmath52 will be considered later .",
    "we use the metropolis algorithm to simulate the configurations of @xmath44 on each site of the lattice , with the boltzmann factor @xmath91 as the weight .",
    "we discard the first @xmath92 sweeps for initialization . from @xmath93 such configurations we calculate the distribution in @xmath61 .",
    "however , owing to ( [ 17 ] ) it is more useful to plot the distribution as a function of  @xmath94 .",
    "the arbitrarily chosen value of @xmath70 affects only the scale of the abscissa and the normalization of @xmath73 .",
    "3 shows the results for @xmath95 and @xmath96 , and for @xmath97 , which is chosen so that for the smallest bin the maximum multiplicity due to surface fluctuation is @xmath98 . as fig .",
    "3(a ) shows , the distribution is very nearly gaussian with half - width around @xmath99 , plus a sharp peak at @xmath100 , corresponding to the preponderant probability that @xmath59 for all four sites in a bin . on the other hand , for the largest bin @xmath101 , the distribution shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) is negligible for @xmath102 , although the maximum possible value , for all @xmath103 , is @xmath104 .",
    "apart from the peak at @xmath100 the half - width is around @xmath105 .",
    "the statistics is poorer in this case because the lattice has far fewer bins per configuration when @xmath79 is increased twenty - fold . as the area @xmath42",
    "is increased by a factor of 400 , the mean multiplicity fluctuation is increased by a factor of only @xmath106 . thus the deviation from a flat surface does not have long wavelength modes , which would have resulted in large @xmath61 configurations in large bins . on the other hand ,",
    "the surface fluctuations are not all local , lest fig .",
    "3(b ) would not be as broad as it is .",
    "putting these @xmath73 distributions for various values of @xmath79 between @xmath107 and @xmath96 in ( [ 15 ] ) and performing the convolution , we obtain the dynamical multiplicity distribution @xmath67 .",
    "4 shows the results for a range of values of @xmath79 with @xmath90 and @xmath108 . from the @xmath67 distribution we can use ( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) to calculate @xmath2 , which we present in the log@xmath2 vs log@xmath109 form in fig .",
    "we see that the straightline behavior supports @xmath0 scaling . as @xmath70",
    "is varied from @xmath110 to @xmath107 , the ranges of @xmath2 values are reduced but the slopes of the straightlines are essentially unchanged .",
    "thus the first part of our objective has been accomplished ; that is , @xmath0 scaling persists even when surface fluctuations are considered .    before we investigate the second part , _ viz .",
    "_ , the effect on scaling exponent , we examine the dependence on @xmath52 .",
    "the foregoing analysis is done for @xmath90 , a value that has been arbitrarily chosen .",
    "we now vary @xmath52 to see the effect on @xmath65 . from the simulated result on @xmath65 for every set of values of @xmath52 and @xmath70",
    ", we calculate the width @xmath111 and show in fig .  6 the dependence of @xmath112 on @xmath52 for the two extreme bin - sizes , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "we see that for @xmath113 there is a maximum at @xmath114 , so the previous result on @xmath90 is not far from maximum surface fluctuation .",
    "@xmath112 is lower at both higher and lower values of @xmath52 because high @xmath52 stiffens the surface and suppresses @xmath61 , while low @xmath52 leads to random @xmath44 and therefore also reduces @xmath61 .",
    "the same is not true for @xmath115 , since even in the limit of @xmath116 the smallness of the bin size makes the cancellation of random @xmath44 ineffective , resulting in a possionian @xmath65 that has nonvanishing width . as @xmath52 increases , the surface becomes smoother , and @xmath112 continues to decrease monotonically .",
    "to summarize , we need only consider the range @xmath117 for maximum effect due to surface fluctuation .",
    "we now can repeat the previous calculations for other values of @xmath52 and produce figures similar to those shown in figs .  4 and 5 .",
    "however , since the results are very similar , we omit those figures .",
    "to determine the slopes @xmath7 of the @xmath0-scaling behavior , we fit all the points in fig .  5 for a given @xmath118 value , including all values of @xmath70 , by a straight line .",
    "the resultant @xmath7 is then shown in fig .  7 for a particular value of   @xmath52 ( @xmath90 for fig .  5 ) .",
    "the error bars in fig .",
    "7 correspond to the deviations from the straightline fits of the points in fig .  5 for @xmath90 only .",
    "for other values of @xmath52 the results from similar calculations are also shown in fig .",
    "no corresponding error bars are shown , since they are similar .",
    "the @xmath7 values are determined only for integer values of @xmath118 , but since the dependence on @xmath52 is so insignificant , we have for clarity exhibited the @xmath7 values by straightline fits according to ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "even so , the overlap obsures the individual lines for different values of @xmath52 , but successfully demonstrates that the scaling exponent @xmath9 is insensitive to @xmath52 . the net value of @xmath9 that can be concluded from fig .",
    "7 is @xmath119 when surface fluctuations are taken into account .",
    "compared to the result of @xmath120 obtained from fig .  2 for pure gl , we see that the change in @xmath9 is well within the errors .",
    "to study the effect of surface fluctuation on the observables of quark - hadron pt , we have incorporated into the gl description an additional term in the free energy that depends on the vertical displacements from a flat surface .",
    "we have used lattice simulation to determine the probability that a bin has a net displacement @xmath61 .",
    "the physics that controls such displacements is color confinement .",
    "we connect the surface fluctuations to multiplicity fluctuations , which in turn are quantified by normalized factorial moments @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath0 scaling of @xmath2 , when the bin size is varied , results in the determination of the scaling exponent @xmath9 .",
    "the aim of this work has been to study the dependence of @xmath9 on surface fluctuations , after verifying that the scaling behavior is not destroyed .",
    "there are two parameters in the calculation , on which we have no _ a priori _ information .",
    "one is @xmath52 ; the other is @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath52 depends on the strength of confinement , and relates the vertical displacement @xmath44 ( arbitrarily normalized ) to the free energy ( normalized by the transition temperature ) .",
    "@xmath70 relates the net displacement @xmath61 of a cell to the deviation of the cell multiplicity from the mean .",
    "we have studied the variation of @xmath9 , when @xmath52 and @xmath70 are varied over the important ranges @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "when @xmath123 or @xmath124 , we do see significant fluctuations .",
    "our result , however , shows that @xmath9 is essentially unchanged when @xmath52 and @xmath70 are varied in the ranges considered .",
    "there is no doubt that when @xmath70 is large enough , the scaling behavior will break down .",
    "but then our method of calculation should become invalid in that case , since large multiplicity fluctuations can not be treated in the framework of the mean - field theory . besides , there is no physical reason to expect that small surface fluctuation can lead to large multiplicity fluctuations .",
    "the significance of this work is therefore in finding that the scaling behavior of pure gl is stable against the perturbation introduced by surface fluctuations .",
    "thus this result improves the ginzburg - landau description of quark - hadron phase transition and provides a more physical connection to the realistic situation in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the end result is that @xmath0 scaling persists even when surface fluctuations are taken into account , and that the scaling exponent , which is experimentally measurable , remains at @xmath125 .",
