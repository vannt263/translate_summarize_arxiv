    "new physics may show up in the searches performed at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) in unexpected ways . the atlas and cms experiments perform a large number of measurements in a variety of final states targetting simple `` benchmark '' novel signatures , but ,",
    "if a sign of new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) eventually appears , its real source may well be different from the specific signature searched for . in the lhc",
    "run 1 at a centre - of - mass ( cm ) energy of 8 tev the most remarkable deviation from the sm prediction was a @xmath19 excess found by the atlas collaboration  @xcite in the search for heavy resonances decaying into two sm gauge bosons @xmath20  also known as diboson resonances  with the bosons decaying hadronically , giving rise to two fat jets @xmath21 .",
    "the excess was compatible with a new heavy resonance with a mass around 2 tev , and it was largest in the @xmath1 channel where the two bosons were respectively tagged as a @xmath22 and a @xmath23 boson .",
    "an analogous search performed by the cms collaboration  @xcite also found an excess at the @xmath24 level around this mass . but searches performed in the semileptonic decay modes of the @xmath1 diboson pair@xcite , some of them more sensitive than the hadronic mode , showed no hint of an excess at this mass .",
    "the absence of any other signals motivated the proposal  @xcite that the anomaly might be due to a triboson resonance , namely , a heavy resonance @xmath0 with a mass around 2 tev decaying into one gauge boson plus an intermediate neutral or charged particle , @xmath5 or @xmath7 , or perhaps both , where the masses of the intermediate particles @xmath3 , @xmath4 could in principle lie in a wide range @xmath25 gev .",
    "the subsequent decays of @xmath3 and @xmath4 into a gauge boson plus some extra particle @xmath2 , @xmath6 and @xmath8 , would produce a @xmath26 triboson signal . and , for this signal , the presence of the extra particle @xmath2 , which could be the sm higgs boson @xmath27 , a @xmath28 boson or a new particle with a mass @xmath29 gev , would make the searches in the semileptonic channels much less sensitive than for a diboson resonance @xmath30 .",
    "such a @xmath26 signal can be realised , for example , in left - right ( lr ) models when the ratio of the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the two scalars @xmath31 , @xmath32 in the bidoublet , @xmath33 , is either very small or very large  @xcite , that is , one of the vevs is much larger than the other . in that case",
    ", the @xmath34 boson plays the role of the heavy resonance @xmath0 and the decays @xmath35 , with a rate proportional to @xmath36 , are absent .",
    "but the decays into heavy scalars , e.g. @xmath37 , @xmath38 , with a rate proportional to @xmath39 , are allowed .",
    "the subsequent cascade decay of the heavy scalars @xmath40 , @xmath41 , with @xmath42 a lighter pseudo - scalar , or @xmath43 , @xmath44 , yield triboson signals .    at the lhc run 2 , with a cm energy of 13 tev , searches for diboson resonances have been performed using data taken in 2015 .",
    "searches in the semileptonic channels  @xcite have not shown any deviation from the sm prediction at this mass and searches in the hadronic channel  @xcite have not confirmed the previously seen excess .",
    "still , the data are not conclusive enough , and the examination of experimental results in the context of triboson signals is worthwhile .",
    "this is the main purpose of this paper . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we discuss in detail the measurements performed by the atlas collaboration in their searches for diboson resonances decaying hadronically , with their similarities and differences . in section  [ sec:3 ]",
    "we present our detailed monte carlo calculations of the qcd dijet background , which do not show any trace of a bump caused by the jet tagging criteria .",
    "section  [ sec:4 ] is devoted to presenting predictions for several selected benchmark scenarios of triboson resonances in a variety of diboson searches . in this respect",
    ", the appearance of a @xmath9 excess in a cms search for low - mass diboson resonances  @xcite decaying into two opposite - sign leptons and a boson - tagged jet ( @xmath45 ) , at a mass of 650 gev , suggests that the cascade decays of the heavy resonance can be mediated by a neutral particle @xmath3 with this mass . in section  [ sec:5 ] we propose discovery strategies for triboson resonances in the fully hadronic atlas search , with minimal changes with respect to the analysis currently carried out . in section  [ sec:6 ]",
    "we discuss our results and their implications for the heavy neutral gauge boson that should accompany the charged resonance presumably responsible for a @xmath26 signal .",
    "the details of our simulations are given in appendix  [ sec : recast ] , and a study of the impact on triboson signals of an upper cut on the number of jet tracks is presented in appendix  [ sec : a ] . an addendum is included in appendix  [ sec : add ] with the predictions of our triboson scenarios for the @xmath46 hadronic search , whose experimental results were released by the atlas collaboration after the submission of this paper .",
    "as aforementioned , the atlas collaboration found a @xmath19 excess in run 1 data at 8 tev with a luminosity of 20.3 fb@xmath47 . for the reader s convenience , we reproduce in figure  [ fig : atlasfs ] ( left ) the number of events with the nominal @xmath1 atlas selection , with the background - only best fit . with run 2 data at 13 tev ,",
    "the atlas collaboration performed a search using 3.2 fb@xmath47 .",
    "given the similar efficiencies of both searches and the @xmath48 times larger @xmath49 partonic luminosity at 13 tev , which compensates the smaller luminosity , a similar excess of around 8 events at 2 tev was expected in run 2 , but the data , reproduced in figure  [ fig : atlasfs ] ( right ) , show no significant deviation and are compatible with the background - only hypothesis at the @xmath50 level .",
    "we restrict our analysis to final states with two @xmath51 tags , which have the highest sensitivity , and present our results in figure  [ fig : vhhad ] , with the same signal normalisation used throughout the paper but for a luminosity of 13.3 fb@xmath47 . for @xmath52 and @xmath53 , in either @xmath34 decay channel , the signals have about the right size and shape to explain the excesses found by the atlas collaboration below 2 tev , which reach @xmath54 in the @xmath55 channel at @xmath56 tev . in this regard , we point out that there is an apparent underfluctuation in the signal regions , compared to the data - driven prediction , for invariant masses around 1.8 tev , especially in the two - tag @xmath55 sample . bearing in mind this effect , the predictions of the triboson scenarios with @xmath52 and @xmath53 seem compatible with the measurements of the atlas collaboration .      g.  aad _ et al . _",
