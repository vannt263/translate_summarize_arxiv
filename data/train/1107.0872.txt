    "it has been recognized that important particle physics ingredients including gauge symmetry and chiral matter can be realized in type ii superstring models using the mechanism of intersecting d - branes @xcite .",
    "more recently , this method has been extensively progressed and it is now possible to investigate some stringy effects which could give rise to deeper details seen in particle physics . in particular , d - brane instantons wrapping non trivial cycles in the internal manifold have been particularly explored in this regard @xcite .",
    "they give non - perturbative superpotential corrections which could explain the large mass hierarchies including the smallness of neutrino masses in the standard model ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "many works have been done along these lines using configurations realizing mssm - like orientifolded models based on quiver approach . in this way , rather than considering full string theory models , working at the level of quivers allow for dealing with many important physical effects .",
    "indeed , one could examine the possible presence or absence of couplings and other physical effects by considering quantum numbers associated with the quiver configuration data .",
    "more precisely , many investigations have been performed for mssm - like orientifolded models satisfying necessary constraints allowing for hierarchical mass terms for all three families of quarks and leptons .",
    "this can be approached using either extra singlet fields that string theory compactifications contain or via euclidean d - brane wrapping non trivial cycles producing e - instantons which we are interested in here @xcite .",
    "they exhibit the so called uncharged modes consisting of fermion modes @xmath5 preserving half of the bulk supersymmetry breaking @xmath6 to @xmath7 and the four bosonic modes @xmath8 , which are associated with breakdown of four - dimensional poincar invariance .",
    "these kinds of uncharged zero modes appear if the instantons wrap non - rigid three - cycles in the internal manifold",
    ". however , the charged fermionic zero modes @xmath9 appearing at the intersection between e - instantons and d - branes are crucial in the determination of superpotential corrections to four dimensional effective field theories .",
    "the non - perturbative contributions are given by performing the path integral over all fermionic zero modes .",
    "to get superpotential terms , one must ensure that all uncharged fermionic zero modes , apart from @xmath8 and @xmath10 , are projected out or lifted . in type iia superstring for instance",
    ", this can be done by considering e2-instantons obtained from d2-branes wrapping rigid orientifold - invariant 3-cycles embedded in the internal space @xcite .",
    "these are referred to as rigid @xmath11 instantons , which will be discussed here . in this picture , when instanton effects do not give rise to phenomenological inconveniences , they therefore represent a way in which one can give rise to viable mass hierarchies for the quarks and leptons as well as the smallness of neutrino masses .    in this paper",
    "we contribute to these activities by performing a discussion of mass hierarchies based on a type iia four - stack quiver orientifolded model in the presence of e2-instanton effects .",
    "more precisely , we focus on @xmath12 quiver gauge theory based on intersecting d6-brane configurations with instanton corrections to the corresponding effective superpotential . for simplicity , we consider @xmath11-instantons wrapping rigid oriontifold - invariant cycles and carrying the right global @xmath13 charges through the @xmath14 . then we give the corresponding mssm - like quiver with the instanton corrections .",
    "compared to perturbatively allowed superpotential terms of the heavy fields , the scales of the induced terms of the light fields depend on the suppression factors of e2-instantons which may induce them with some combinations with the string scale @xmath15 through higher order terms .",
    "this mechanism offers a stringy framework to explain the fermion mass hierarchies in the quiver method . including the left - handed neutrino masses in the analysis",
    ", we get the order of magnitude of the relevant instanton effects and recover the string scale upper bound @xmath16 .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we build a quiver gauge theory realizing mssm - like orientifolded models based on four stacks of intersecting d6-branes . in section 3",
    ", we study the fermion mass hierarchies by introducing the possible stringy corrections to the corresponding superpotential using o(1 ) e2-instantons then we give the corresponding quiver .",
    "their suppression magnitudes have been estimated .",
    "section 4 will be devoted to our discussions .",
    "in this section , we will give a quiver model based on four - stack of d6-branes embedded in iia superstring moving on orientifolded geometry .",
    "the gauge theory lives on d6-branes wrapping four - dimensional minkowski space and non trivial 3-cycles in the internal manifold @xcite .",
    "it is recalled that d6-branes carry ramond - ramond charges that should be cancelled by the introduction of orientifold geometries related to fixed point loci of an antiholomorphic involution acting on the internal space . in such quiver models ,",
    "the bifundamental chiral matter arises at the non - trivial intersection of two generic d6-branes .",
    "it turns out that , one can have symmetric or anti - symmetric tensor representations where a d6-brane intersects its image brane under the orientifold action .",
    "furthermore , two given d6-branes might intersect in multiple points on the compact internal space , giving rise to multiple families , where the number of families is the topological intersection number of two 3-cycles belonging to middle dimensional cohomology .",
    "indeed , a stack of @xmath17 d6-branes wrapping 3-cycles gives rise to @xmath18 gauge symmetry .",
    "however , @xmath17 d6-branes wrapped on cycles which are homologically - fixed or pointwise - fixed by the orientifold action give rise to @xmath19 and @xmath20 gauge symmetry , respectively .",
    "since @xmath21 is isomorphic to @xmath22 , the @xmath23 of the mssm - like models can be realized as a @xmath21 arising from a d6-brane stack wrapping an orientifold invariant 3-cycle . in this regard ,",
    "the sm gauge symmetry and the matter content can be accommodated in the gauge group @xmath24 ) obtained from three stacks of d6-branes . enlarging the gauge group can make the model richer .",
    "this can be done by assuming that one has an appropriate middle dimensional cohomology generated by non trivial 3-cycles .",
    "the model we consider here relies on a four stacks of d6-branes giving rise to the following gauge symmetry @xmath25with a gauged flavor group @xmath26 distinguishing various quarks from each others .",
    "roughly , the tadpole conditions imply the vanishing of non - abelian anomalies , while abelian and mixed anomalies are canceled via the green - schwarz mechanism .",
    "generically , the anomalous @xmath27 acquire a mass and survive only as global symmetries , which forbid various couplings on the perturbative level .",
    "since the sm gauge symmetries contain the abelian symmetry @xmath28 , and the @xmath21 does not exhibit a @xmath29 which could contribute to the hypercharge , one requires that a linear combination of @xmath30 remains massless .",
    "thus , the resulting gauge group in four - dimensional spacetime can be written as @xmath31given the above gauge symmetry based on d6-brane configurations , we can construct a quiver describing mssm - like orientifolded model .",
    "indeed , vanishing of anomalies which we require to be satisfied are used to fit the matter content involving two up quarks , one down quark charged under the @xmath32 gauge symmetry and the opposite arrangement charged under @xmath33 the model we present here relies on a particular intersection numbers of 3-cycles in middle dimensional cohomology . for that",

    "what follows , the @xmath38 symmetries will be used to select the candidate terms for the superpotential . taking into account the charges presented in the table 1 , we can write down the all allowed interaction terms generating the possible yukawa couplings .",
    "it turns out that , the only fields involved in the allowed perturbative interaction terms are those charged under the @xmath39 gauge symmetry .",

    "our quiver naturally allows for the following couplings @xmath48where @xmath49 are coupling constants accounting for hierarchies between these terms .",

    "these will be refered to  the light fermions @xmath50 that will be yielded massless , unless some kind of new effects in the defined effective field theory break the remnants abelian symmetries @xmath38 . in string theory , the natural candidate",
    "non - perturbative effects to violate these @xmath38 symmetries are instantons arising from euclidean d - branes coupling to these fields @xcite .",
    "they can potentially destabilize the vacuum or lead to new effects in the four - dimensional effective action . in what follows",

    "then , we discuss fermion mass hierarchies in such instanton configurations .",
    "in this section we introduce the effects of spacetime instantons on the above described model . in type iia superstring model , such non - perturbative effects are generated in principle from d0 , d2 and d4-branes wrapping one , three and five - cycles respectively . however , since a calabi - yau manifold does not have any continuous one and five - cycles , the only relevant instantons are d2-branes wrapped on three - cycles in the internal manifold @xcite .",
