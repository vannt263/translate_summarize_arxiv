    "for intermediate - mass ( ` @xmath0-shell ' ) nuclei , which are currently inaccessible by standard _ ab initio _ no - core shell - model ( ncsm ) @xcite calculations , symmetry - based considerations are essential .",
    "in particular , we employ the no - core symplectic ( ncspm ) shell model for symmetry - preserving interactions @xcite with @xmath1 the underpinning symmetry @xcite . this symmetry is inherent to the dynamics of deformed nuclear systems @xcite . the present study uses a schematic , but fully microscopic and physically motivated effective many - nucleon interaction , a choice that enables the use of group - theoretical methods with analytical expressions for hamiltonian matrix elements , and which in turn makes large space solutions for @xmath0-shell nuclei feasible .",
    "recently , we successfully applied the ncspm model to the rotational and alpha - cluster substructures of @xmath2c , including the hoyle state ( the second @xmath3 state in @xmath2c ) and its rotational band @xcite , as well as of @xmath4be @xcite .",
    "the symplectic model has been used previously to achieve a remarkable reproduction of enhanced @xmath5 transition strengths in @xmath6ne without effective charges and with the use of a relatively simple symmetry - breaking valence - shell interaction @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been applied to @xmath7er using the davidson potential @xcite .",
    "the main objective of the present study is to offer qualitative results that can provide guidance for _ ab initio _ shell model approaches by informing key features of nuclear structure and the interaction , first on the physically relevant truncation of shell - model spaces , but also on the dominant deformation and particle - hole configurations .",
    "this is especially useful for the _ ab initio _ symmetry - adapted no - core shell model ( sa - ncsm ) @xcite , which will then bring forward , with the use of a realistic nucleon - nucleon interaction , an accurate reproduction and reliable prediction of energy spectra and associated transition rates that majorly impact modeling of stellar explosions and astrophysical processes .    in this study",
    ", we explore the ground - state ( @xmath8 ) rotational band of lower @xmath0-shell nuclei , namely , @xmath6o , @xmath9ne , @xmath10 mg , and @xmath11si .",
    "these low - lying states are expected to be highly influenced by large deformation .",
    "this , together with the combinatorial growth in model space dimensionality with number of particles and the spaces in which they primarily reside , has hitherto precluded a no - core shell model description and typically , in this region , valence shell model or mean field approaches have been employed ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "many of these nuclei are in close proximity to the proton drip line and are key to understanding , e.g. , novae and x - ray bursts ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , properties of low - lying @xmath12 and @xmath13 states in isotopes as @xmath6 mg and @xmath11si are required to predict @xmath14 reaction rates that are expected to affect the light curve for x - ray bursts . as such unstable isotopes are very hard to make experimentally and state - of - the - art radioactive - beam measurements have only recently started to provide new information @xcite , theoretical predictions are valuable .",
    "the present approach utilizes symmetry to reduce the dimensionality of the model space through a very structured winnowing of the basis states to physically relevant subspaces . indeed , experimental evidence supports the fact that in this mass range , the dynamics favors a dominance of low spin and high deformation , which has been demonstrated by symmetry - guided theoretical studies @xcite as well as through an _ ab initio _ study @xcite .",
    "the latter exploits symplectic symmetry and its deformation - related @xmath15 subgroup in an analysis of _ ab initio _ large - scale nuclear physics applications for @xmath2c and @xmath16o .",
    "the outcome of this study has revealed that typically only one or two symplectic many - body basis states ( vertical cones ) suffice to represent a large fraction  typically in excess of about 80% of the physics  as measured by projecting _",
    "ab initio _ ncsm results onto a symmetry - adapted equivalent basis .",
    "such a symplectic pattern has been also observed in an _ ab initio _ sa - ncsm study of @xmath17li , @xmath17he , and @xmath4be @xcite .",
    "these findings point to the relevance of the symplectic symmetry , first to the many - body nuclear wavefunctions , and then to the inter - nucleon interaction ( as symplectic basis states appear not to mix strongly ) .",
    "the ncspm builds upon these considerations , and here we offer solutions to @xmath0-shell nuclei in the framework of a fully microscopic no - core shell model .",
    "this , in turn , allows us to examine the role of currently inaccessible shell - model spaces , up through 15 major shells , and of associated particle excitations to these shells for a description of large deformation .",
    "we employ the no - core symplectic model ( ncspm ) , outlined in refs .",
    "@xcite , with a novel interaction that is effectively realized by an exponential dependence on the quadrupole - quadrupole ( @xmath18 ) two - body interaction , the physically relevant interaction of each particle with the total quadrupole moment of the nuclear system .",
    "this introduces simple but important many - body interactions that enter in a prescribed hierarchical way given in powers of a small parameter , the only adjustable parameter in the model .",
    "the model offers a microscopic no - core shell - model description of nuclei in terms of mixed deformed configurations and allows the inclusion of higher - energy particle excitations @xcite that are currently inaccessible by _ ab initio _ shell models .",
    "it reduces to the successful elliott model @xcite in the limit of a single valence shell and a zero model parameter .",
    "the underlying symmetry of the ncspm is the symplectic @xmath1 group @xcite and its embedded @xmath15 subgroup @xcite .",
    "the symplectic basis ( detailed in @xcite ) utilized in ncspm is related , via a unitary transformation , to the three - dimensional ho ( @xmath19-scheme ) many - body basis used in the ncsm ( see the review @xcite ) . the conventional ncsm basis spaces @xcite are constructed using ho single - particle states and are characterized by the @xmath20 oscillator strength ( or equivalently , the oscillator length @xmath21 for a nucleon mass @xmath19 ) as well as by the cutoff in total oscillator quanta , @xmath22 , above the lowest ho energy configuration for a given nucleus .",
    "indeed , the ncspm employed within a complete model space up through @xmath23 , will coincide with the ncsm for the same @xmath23 cutoff .",
    "the important feature of the ncspm model is its ability to down - select to the most relevant configurations , which are chosen among all possible @xmath1 irreducible representations ( irreps ) within an @xmath23 model space .",
    "the @xmath1 irreps divide the space into ` vertical cones ' that are comprised of basis states of definite @xmath24 quantum numbers of @xmath15 linked to the intrinsic quadrupole deformation @xcite .",
    "e.g. , the simplest cases , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , describe spherical , prolate , and oblate deformation , respectively , while a general nuclear state is typically a superposition of several hundred various @xmath24 triaxial deformation configurations .",
    "the translationally invariant ( intrinsic ) symplectic generators can be written as @xmath15 tensor operators in terms of the harmonic oscillator raising , @xmath28 , and lowering @xmath29 dimensionless operators ( with @xmath30 and @xmath31 the lab - frame position and momentum coordinates and @xmath32 for the three spatial directions ) , @xmath33^{(2\\,0)}_{\\mathfrak{l}m } - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}a } \\sum_{s , t=1}^a \\left[b^{\\dagger}_{s}\\times b^{\\dagger}_{t}\\right]^{(2\\,0)}_{\\mathfrak{l}m }   \\label{sp3rgena}\\\\ c^{(1\\,1)}_{\\mathfrak{l}m}\\!\\!&=&\\!\\ ! \\sqrt{2 }",

    "the eight operators @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) generate the @xmath15 subgroup of @xmath1 .",
    "they realize the angular momentum operator : @xmath40 and the elliott algebraic quadrupole moment tensor @xmath41 .",
    "the mass quadrupole moment can be constructed in terms of the symplectic generators as , @xmath42      a many - body basis state of a symplectic irrep is labeled according to the group chain , @xmath43 and constructed by acting with symmetrically coupled polynomials in the symplectic raising operators , @xmath44 , on a unique symplectic bandhead configuration , @xmath45 , @xmath46^{n}\\times{\\ensuremath{\\left| \\sigma \\right\\rangle}}\\right]^{\\rho\\omega}_{\\kappa l m } , \\label{basis}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 labels the @xmath1 irrep , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the total number of ho quanta ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 are multiplicity labels ) .",
    "this can be generalized to include spin , @xmath55 , and also isospin .",
    "states within a symplectic irrep have the same spin ( isospin ) value , which is given by the spin @xmath56 ( isospin @xmath57 ) of the bandhead @xmath58 @xcite .",

    "( [ basis ] ) , the basis states of an @xmath1 irrep ( vertical cone ) are built over a bandhead @xmath45 by 2@xmath20   @xmath60p-@xmath60h ( one particle raised by two shells ) monopole ( @xmath61 ) or quadrupole ( @xmath62 ) excitations , realized by the first term in @xmath63 of eq .",

    "the symplectic bandhead @xmath45 is the lowest - weight @xmath1 state , which is defined by the usual requirement that the symplectic lowering operators annihilate it  in analogy to a @xmath65 state for the case of the @xmath66 group of angular momentum , that is , @xmath67 .",
    "the bandhead , @xmath68 , is an @xmath15-coupled many - body state with a given nucleon distribution over the ho shells and while not utilized here , can be obtained in terms of the creation operators @xmath69 , which create a particle in the ho shell @xmath70 .",
    "e.g. , for a 0@xmath20  bandhead , the nucleon distribution is a single configuration , @xmath71^{(\\lambda_{\\sigma}\\ , \\mu_{\\sigma})}_{\\kappa_\\sigma l_\\sigma m_\\sigma}{\\ensuremath{\\left| 0 \\right\\rangle}}\\ ] ] with @xmath72 , such that @xmath73 includes the ho zero - point energy and @xmath74 is subtracted to ensure a proper treatment of the cm . to eliminate the spurious cm motion",
    ", the ncspm also uses symplectic generators constructed in @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) particle position ( momentum ) coordinates relative to the cm .",
    "these generators are used to build the basis , the interaction , the many - particle kinetic energy operator , as well as to evaluate observables .",
    "an example for the symplectic basis states follows for @xmath11 mg .",
    "its lowest ho - energy configuration is given by @xmath77 or 0@xmath20 , while the 4@xmath20  @xmath78 symplectic irrep includes :    1 .",

    "the quantum numbers @xmath54 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are given by elliott @xcite .",
    "e.g. , for @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "we note that the ncspm , as presented here , is limited to interactions that preserve the @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "this restriction facilitates the use of a group - theoretical apparatus and analytical expressions for the hamiltonian matrix elements , which , in turn , makes it possible to incorporate large @xmath23 spaces in applications of the theory . _",
    "ab initio _ calculations lie beyond the scope of the current analysis , but the addition of symmetry - mixing terms in the interaction is feasible , and a logical extension of the theory to include such terms is under development . @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonians appear to be particularly suitable to capture the essential characteristics of the low - energy nuclear kinematics and dynamics .",
    "the reason is that important pieces of the inter - nucleon hamiltonian of a quantum many - body system can be expressed in terms of the @xmath1 generators , which directly relate to the relative particle momentum and position coordinates , as well as straightforwardly account for the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "indeed , the many - particle kinetic energy ( @xmath95 ) , the ho potential ( @xmath96 ) , the mass quadrupole moment operator ( @xmath97 ) , and the orbital momentum ( @xmath89 ) are all elements of the @xmath98 structure .    hence",
    ", @xmath1-preserving hamiltonians can include the many - particle kinetic energy : @xmath99 the ho potential : @xmath100 as well as terms dependent on @xmath89 , see eq .",
    "( [ lgen ] ) , and @xmath97 , see eq .",
    "( [ qgen ] ) .",
    "these interactions have analytical matrix elements in the @xmath1 basis ( [ basis ] ) and act within a symplectic vertical cone ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "for example , for the dimensionless many - particle kinetic energy , @xmath102 , the matrix elements are given as :    @xmath103    where @xmath104 is an @xmath15 clebsch - gordan coefficient .",
    "the matrix elements of the @xmath1 generators , @xmath44 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 , reduced with respect to @xmath15 , such as @xmath107 , are known exactly @xcite and the steps to calculate them are outlined in the appendix .    the simplest , @xmath1-preserving hamiltonian , besides the ho hamiltonian ( @xmath108 ) , of importance to nuclear dynamics is @xcite , @xmath109 with @xmath110 being a coupling constant and , @xmath111 here @xmath112 is the dimensionless single - particle mass quadrupole moment and @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) is the particle position ( momentum ) coordinate relative to the cm . in the limit of a single , valence shell ( @xmath79 ) , where @xmath15 becomes the relevant symmetry ,",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath113 was shown to effectively describe rotational features of light nuclei in the framework of the established elliott model @xcite .",
    "the success of such an effective nuclear interaction is not unexpected , as the spherical ho potential and the @xmath18 interaction directly follow from the second and third term , respectively , in the long - range expansion of any two - body central force , e.g. , like the yukawa radial dependence , @xmath114 @xcite , for a range parameter @xmath115 .",
    "however , in multi - shell studies , the attractive @xmath18 term becomes ever stronger with increasing @xmath87 and starts to dominate the dynamics .",
    "hence , @xmath113 yields unphysical solutions .    a successful extension to multiple shells has been achieved and applied to the @xmath11 mg @xmath8 rotational band @xcite , where an interaction given as a polynomial in @xmath97 , @xmath116 , @xmath117\\cdot q$ ] , and @xmath118 , was employed .",
    "furthermore , in multi - shell studies , the @xmath119 interaction has been employed @xcite , where @xmath120 is the average contribution of @xmath18 within the subspace of @xmath87 ho excitations , that is , the trace of @xmath18 divided by the space dimension for a fixed @xmath87 .",
    "this removes the large monopole contribution of the @xmath18 interaction , which , in turn , helps eliminate the considerable renormalization of the zero - point ho energy , while retaining the @xmath18-driven behavior of the wavefunctions .",
    "we consider a novel effective many - nucleon interaction @xcite suitable for large-@xmath23 no - core shell models , @xmath122 that addresses the limitations of the conventional @xmath113 , while retaining the @xmath113 important features in the limit @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is a positive adjustable parameter .",
    "we take @xmath125 with @xmath126 the total ho quanta of the final ( initial ) many - body basis state .",
    "the decrease of @xmath110 with @xmath83 , to a leading order in @xmath127 , has been shown by rowe @xcite based on self - consistent arguments and used in an @xmath1-based study of cluster - like states of @xmath16o @xcite .",
    "above all , the effective interaction ( [ effh ] ) introduces hierarchical many - body interactions in a prescribed way ( for @xmath128 ) .",
    "@xmath129 also ensures that the @xmath18 term tails off for large @xmath87 eliminating its ever stronger attraction with increasing @xmath87 .",
    "such an interaction directly ties to the @xmath97 polynomial considered in the above - mentioned study of ref .",

    "we focused on the @xmath8 rotational band of @xmath6ne ( a nucleus multiple of an @xmath149 particle ) , as well as of @xmath198ne , @xmath6o and of the proton - rich @xmath10 mg , and @xmath11si nuclei .    by utilizing the symplectic symmetry",
    ", we were able to accommodate model spaces up through 15 major ho shells and hence , to take into account essential high-@xmath20  particle excitations .",
    "these excitations were found key to the description of large deformation and the convergence of electric observables without effective charges .",
    "these configurations were included in the shell - model space by considering only one symplectic irrep ( vertical cone ) built on the most deformed spin - zero bandhead and extended to @xmath155 .",
    "this further confirms the dominance of low - spin / high - deformation and the importance of the symplectic symmetry to the low - energy nuclear dynamics .",
    "most importantly , the ncspm has allowed us to identify , from a no - core shell - model perspective , components of the inter - nucleon interaction and type of particle excitations that appear foremost responsible for unveiling the primary physics governing highly - deformed structures , starting with rotational and alpha - clustering features in the case of @xmath2c @xcite and @xmath4be @xcite , but also expanding to the region of the lower @xmath0 shell ( @xmath199 ) .",
