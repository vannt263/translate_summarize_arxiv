    "the understanding of the production of the heavy quarkonium ( bound states of heavy quark ( @xmath8 ) and heavy anti - quark ( @xmath9 ) ) has been a long - term effort both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the different treatments of the non - perturbative evolution of the @xmath10 pair into a quarkonium lead to various theoretical models .",
    "there are mainly three models widely used to describe the production of quarkonium : the color singlet model ( csm ) , the color evaporation model ( cem ) and the nrqcd framework .",
    "the csm , proposed right after the discovery of the @xmath0 , assumes that the @xmath10 pair evolving in a quarkonium state is in a color - singlet ( cs ) state and the quantum numbers such as spin and angular momentum , are conserved after the formation of the quarkonium .",
    "the only inputs required in the model are the absolute value of the colour singlet @xmath10 wave function and its derivatives that can be determined from data of decay processes .",
    "once these quantities are provided , the csm has no free parameters  @xcite .",
    "the csm at leading - order , predicts well the quarkonium production rates at relatively low energy  @xcite , but fails to describe the data for charmonium measured by cdf experiment in @xmath11 collisions  @xcite probably because it ignores the fragmentation processes from higher states or @xmath5 mesons , dominant at tevatron energies  @xcite .",
    "recently it has been revived , with the computation at higher orders in the strong coupling constant @xmath12 expansion  @xcite , since it was found to better accomodate polarization results from tevatron with respect to nrqcd .",
    "the cem  @xcite is a phenomenologically successful model and was first proposed in 1977  @xcite . in the cem ,",
    "the cross - section for a quarkonium state @xmath13 is a fraction @xmath14 of the cross - section of the produced @xmath10 pairs with invariant mass below the @xmath15 threshold , where @xmath16 is the lowest mass meson containing the heavy quark @xmath8 .",
    "this cross - section has an upper limit on the @xmath10 pair mass but no constraints on the colour or spin of the final state .",
    "the @xmath10 pair is assumed to neutralize its colour by interaction with the collision - induced colour field by `` colour evaporation '' .",
    "an important feature is that the fractions @xmath14 are assumed to be universal so that , once they are determined by data , they can be used to predict the cross - sections in other processes and in other kinematical regions .",
    "the most basic prediction of the cem is that the ratio of the cross - sections for any two quarkonium states should be constant , independent of the process and the kinematical region .",
    "variations in these ratios have been observed : for example the ratio of the cross - sections for @xmath17 and @xmath0 are rather different in photoproduction and hadroproduction and the ratio between different charmonium cross - sections measured at lhc is not constant as a function of @xmath18 .",
    "these variations represent a serious challange to the status of the cem as a quantitative phenomenological model for quarkonium production .",
    "however , the model is still widely used as simulation benchmark since , once the @xmath14 fractions are determined , it has a full predicting power about cross - sections but it fails to predict the quarkonium polarization .",
    "on the other hand , nrqcd can predict both the cross - section and the polarization of quarkonium production . in nrqcd ,",
    "contributions to the quarkonium cross - section from the heavy - quark pairs produced in a color - octet ( co ) state are also taken into account , in addition to the cs contributions described above .",
    "the picture of the nrqcd  @xcite formalism is as follows .",
    "the orbital splittings in case of quarkonium bound states are smaller than the heavy quark mass @xmath19 , which suggests that all the other dynamical scales of these systems are smaller than @xmath19 .",
    "so , the relative velocity @xmath20 between @xmath8 and @xmath9 is believed to be a small quantity , @xmath20 @xmath21 1 .",
    "therefore , a hierarchy of scales , @xmath19 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath22 @xmath24 , as observed in a non - relativistic ( nr ) system , also holds for quarkonia .",
    "here , @xmath19 fixes the distance range for @xmath25 creation and annihilation processes , the momentum @xmath23 is inversely proportional to the spatial size of the bound state and the kinetic energy @xmath24 determines the typical interaction time scale .",
    "these different distance scales make the study of quarkonium production interesting and nrqcd calculation incorporates this scale hierarchy .",
    "the quarkonia production in nrqcd is calculated in two steps . at first",
    ", the creation of the @xmath25 pair in a hard scattering at short distances which is calculated perturbatively as an expansions in the the strong coupling constant @xmath12 . note that @xmath25 states can be in a cs state  @xcite as well as in a co state  @xcite .",
    "then , the @xmath25 pair is evolved into the quarkonium state with the probabilities that are given by the assumed universal nonperturbative long - distance matrix elements ( ldmes ) which are estimated on the basis of the comparison with experimental measurements .",
    "for co states , this evolution process also involves the nonperturbative emission of soft gluons to form cs states .",
    "the crucial feature of this formalism is that it takes into account the complete structure of the @xmath25 fock space , which is spanned by the states @xmath26}_j$ ] , where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath4 are the spin , orbital and total angular momenta , respectively and @xmath29 is the color multiplicity .",
    "a remarkable progress has been made in quarkonium production studies during last decade based on the nrqcd formalism  @xcite .    in recent times , the charmonium production in @xmath2 collisions has been measured at @xmath30 and 7 tev by the alice  @xcite , atlas  @xcite , cms  @xcite and lhcb  @xcite collaborations at forward , near forward and mid rapidities . it may be noted here that atlas , cms and lhcb collaborations report the prompt production cross - sections while alice measurements include also the @xmath5 feed - down to @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the fonll  @xcite formalism has been used to calculate the production cross - sections of @xmath0 and @xmath1 from @xmath5 meson decays which accounts for the feed - down contributions from @xmath5 meson to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 productions .    in the present work",
    ", the charmonium cross - sections have been calculated at @xmath30 and 7 tev within the framework of lo nrqcd and compared with available experimental data from lhc .",
    "the predictions for the production cross - sections of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in @xmath2 collisions at @xmath31 = 13 tev has been made as these collisions are foreseen at lhc in 2015 .",
    "in addition , the calculations have also been performed at @xmath31 = 5.1 tev which can be utilized for the normalization of the pb - pb data to be collected at @xmath32 tev .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "results and comparison with experimental measurements will be presented in sec .",

    "<S> we have performed a systematic study of @xmath0 and @xmath1 production in @xmath2 collisions at different lhc energies and at different rapidities using the leading order ( lo ) non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) model of heavy quarkonium production . </S>",
    "<S> we have included the contributions from @xmath3 ( @xmath4 = 0 , 1 , 2 ) and @xmath1 decays to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated values have been compared with the available data from the four experiments at lhc namely , alice , atlas , cms and lhcb . in case of alice , inclusive @xmath0 and @xmath1 cross - sections </S>",
    "<S> have been calculated by including the feed - down from @xmath5 meson using fixed - order next - to - leading logarithm ( fonll ) formalism . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that all the experimental cross - sections are well reproduced for @xmath6 4 gev within the theoretical uncertainties arising due to the choice of the factorization scale . </S>",
    "<S> we also predict the transverse momentum distributions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 both for the direct and feed - down processes at the upcoming lhc energies of @xmath7 5.1 tev and 13 tev for the year 2015 . </S>"
