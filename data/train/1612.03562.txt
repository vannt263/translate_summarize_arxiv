    "<S> quartz tuning forks are high - quality mechanical oscillators widely used in low temperature physics as viscometers , thermometers and pressure sensors . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that a fork placed in liquid helium near the surface of solid helium is very sensitive to the oscillations of the solid - liquid interface . </S>",
    "<S> we developed a double - resonance read - out technique which allowed us to detect oscillations of the surface with an accuracy of 1  in 10 sec . using this technique </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated crystallization waves in @xmath0he down to 10mk . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previous studies of crystallization waves , our measurement scheme has very low dissipation , on the order of 20pw , which allows us to carry out experiments even at sub - mk temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we propose to use this scheme in the search for crystallization waves in @xmath1he , which exist only at temperatures well below 0.5mk .    </S>",
    "<S> interfaces in quantum fluids and solids display a variety of physical phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to usual capillary - gravity waves they are mobile enough to support also phase waves , like crystallization waves @xcite or massless phase waves@xcite on the a - b interface of @xmath1he . besides the fact that these phase waves are very interesting and unusual on their own , they present a unique tool to investigate surface bound states . </S>",
    "<S> surface quasiparticles contribute directly to the surface tension as well as to the dissipation of the surface waves , so that they can be detected by measuring the dispersion relation of the waves .    </S>",
    "<S> usually , the contribution of surface excitations to the dissipation of the surface waves is masked by the interaction with particles in bulk phases . </S>",
    "<S> however , at low temperatures the contribution from the bulk particles decreases as @xmath2 or even faster.@xcite due to their 2d nature , surface excitations experience slower decay upon cooling , and at a low enough temperature they provide the largest contribution to the dissipation of the waves . </S>",
    "<S> helium is the only substance which remains liquid at ultralow temperatures and thus allows to investigate surface waves and various surface bound states .    </S>",
    "<S> manninen _ et al._@xcite have performed pioneering experiments on capillary - gravity waves on the free surface of liquid @xmath1he well below the superfluid transition temperature of 1mk . </S>",
    "<S> their measurements suggest that at temperatures below 0.2mk the damping of the capillary - gravity waves is no longer determined by the bulk quasiparticles , the density of which vanishes exponentially with decreasing temperature.@xcite interestingly , different modes of the surface waves had different temperature dependence of dissipation , which may indicate wave - number dependent interaction with the surface states .    </S>",
    "<S> crystallization waves in @xmath0he were predicted by andreev and parshin @xcite in 1978 and discovered two years later by keshishev _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  at temperatures below 0.5k.@xcite by measuring the frequency of crystallization waves at crystal surfaces of different orientations , rolley _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _  have observed , as predicted by landau,@xcite a singularity in the surface tension at the orientation of the basal facet.@xcite    in @xmath1he , an interfacial wave between solid and superfluid phases is an even more intriguing object to study because it has to accommodate to the magnetically ordered phase of the solid and the p - wave - paired order parameter of @xmath1he superfluid . due to </S>",
    "<S> the magnetically ordered solid , the crystallization wave is accompanied by spin supercurrents which contribute to the inertia of this wave along with the regular mass flow , and in high enough magnetic fields the whole inertial mass of the wave is of a magnetic origin . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to the entropy related to magnetic degrees of freedom , crystallization waves in @xmath1he are strongly damped and can be observed only at temperatures well below 0.5mk.@xcite this sub - mk temperature requirement sets strong limitations for the excitation of the waves because the electrical capacitors utilized to generate the waves may produce significant heat load to the helium sample .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we suggest a new , extremely sensitive and low dissipation scheme for detection of surface waves . we have tested this scheme by successfully observing crystallization waves in @xmath0he down to oscillation amplitudes of few nanometers . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained results show that the developed technique can be used to investigate surface waves in the sub - millikelvin range .    </S>",
    "<S> excitation of surface waves at low temperatures is a very difficult experimental task . </S>",
    "<S> generally , one needs to oscillate pressure at@xmath3near the surface . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the oscillating pressure should be applied locally because a spatially uniform pressure variation will oscillate the surface as a whole ( @xmath4 ) , instead of producing waves on it . </S>",
    "<S> however , the speed of sound @xmath5m@xmath3s  @xcite in liquid helium at the melting pressure is much faster than the speed of surface waves which means that the needed pressure variation can not be applied via liquid by any mechanical transducer . instead , electrical capacitors partly immersed in helium can be used to create local pressure variation . due to its electrical polarizability </S>",
    "<S> , helium acquires additional energy in the electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the electrical energy is equivalent to additional pressure    @xmath6    according to the clausius - mossotti relation , the permittivity @xmath7 relates to the polarizability @xmath8 by : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the molar volume . among all atoms , helium atom has the smallest polarizability , @xmath11@xmath12mol , which is three times smaller than that of hydrogen . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , liquid helium is quite a rarefied medium with a molar volume of about 30@xmath12mol at @xmath13bar , almost twice that of water . </S>",
    "<S> these result in the very small value of @xmath14 for condensed helium phases ( 0.054 for liquid @xmath0he and 0.052 for liquid @xmath1he at zero bar ) and , correspondingly , in very low electrostatic pressure @xmath15 from eq.([eq : electro ] ) . to exemplify , an electrical field of 2mv@xmath3 m is needed to lift the liquid - vapour helium interface on a capacitor by 1 mm . to decrease the voltage needed for such a high electric field </S>",
    "<S> one can decrease the spacing @xmath16 in the capacitor . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this way the volume of the capacitor also decreases , which leads to a reduction of the relative share of the electric energy . </S>",
    "<S> practical values of the spacing are thus set by the above limitations to the range 20 ... 100@xmath17 m , and the corresponding voltages are a few hundred of volts .    in their experiments on crystallization waves </S>",
    "<S> rolley _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _  utilized an interdigital capacitor on borosilicate glass with a periodicity of 80@xmath17m.@xcite they measured the dielectric losses in the substrate of the capacitor to be about 30@xmath17w at typical drives ( 170v peak - to - peak @ 1khz ) , and such </S>",
    "<S> a high heat leak limited the temperature of their experiment to 40mk . to reduce dielectric losses , we made our capacitor using a double winding of 60@xmath17 m thin superconducting wire on a copper holder . </S>",
    "<S> eddy current heating due to the displacement currents are minimized in this design because currents in neighboring wires flow in opposite directions . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of dielectric was minimized by choosing wires with a thin ( 5@xmath17 m ) insulation layer and using thin cigarette paper and very diluted ge - varnish . </S>",
    "<S> the height and the width of the capacitor were also kept small with @xmath18 mm and @xmath19 mm , respectively , thus reducing the volume of dielectric material and the induced losses in proportion .    </S>",
    "<S> the solid - liquid interface of helium is even more difficult to drive because solid helium wets solid surfaces very poorly . </S>",
    "<S> the capillary forces preventing the solid from filling the narrow gap of large field at the capacitor can be estimated as follows . </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium balance of liquid and solid phases near the capacitor is set by the equality of chemical potentials , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the equilibrium pressure at the flat reference interface far from the capacitor . </S>",
    "<S> gravity and electric field contribute to the pressure in the liquid as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the vertical position of the surface with respect to the reference level . </S>",
    "<S> the pressure within the solid having a curvature @xmath24 is larger than in the liquid by the laplace pressure @xmath25 where @xmath8 is the surface tension and @xmath26 reflects the size of the capacitor spacing . </S>",
    "<S> hence , one obtains the following equation for the capillary - gravity - electrical equilibrium shape : @xmath27=\\alpha / r$ ] .    from this equation </S>",
    "<S> we can separate the electric pressure needed to compensate for capillary forces , @xmath28 and the electric pressure needed to lift the crystal surface @xmath29 . substituting values @xcite for @xmath0he , @xmath30j@xmath3m@xmath31 and @xmath32 </S>",
    "<S> we obtain for the critical field @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[fig : capacitor]a displays areas near the capacitor s neighbouring wires where the @xmath34 at different voltages @xmath35 applied across the two capacitor electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that at voltages @xmath36v the gap with the high field is still too small to overcome the capillary forces , and first at @xmath37v applied to the capacitor the gap becomes of the order of @xmath16 to fit the solid . </S>",

    "<S> a change in the distance @xmath43 between the interface and the fork distorts the velocity field in the liquid around the oscillating fork and thus changes its effective hydrodynamic mass . </S>",
    "<S> this causes a change in the resonance frequency of the fork . </S>",

    "<S> a high ac voltage @xmath45 at a low frequency @xmath46hz is applied to the capacitor which drives the interface at the frequency @xmath41 because the electrostatic pressure is proportional to the square of the field . </S>",

    "<S> fig.[fig : solid4]a displays the measured detuning of the fork due to a change in the @xmath0he solid - liquid interface position as a function of the dc voltage applied to the capacitor . </S>",
    "<S> as is seen from the figure , there is a threshold voltage of about 210v above which the crystal starts filling the capacitor , and the level the of solid near the fork decreases . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the threshold is in good agreement with the estimations of the capillary forces in the previous section and with the calculations of the electrical field shown in fig.[fig : capacitor]a . at higher voltages , </S>",
    "<S> the detuning increases slowly because the field decays exponentially with the distance from the capacitor , and , correspondingly , the volume of the high field region increases only logarithmically with the voltage . </S>",

    "<S> the first two peaks at 13 and 22hz correspond to the fundamental resonance and its first harmonic across the whole crystal - liquid interface ( our wave generator excites the interface on both sides and the inner and outer regions are strongly coupled on the liquid side ) . </S>",
    "<S> the third peak at @xmath63hz is assigned to the second harmonic , which is weakly coupled to the fork owing to its asymmetric mode shape with respect to the oscillation detector . </S>",

    "<S> equally good resolution has been reached earlier in measurements on crystal growth @xcite with a much more complicated optical setup .    in order to test the heating by the capacitor </S>",
    "<S> , we made a separate cooldown in which we condensed @xmath1he in the same cell . at the melting pressure and at the lowest temperature of 0.39mk@xmath64 </S>",
    "<S> , we have measured the dissipation produced by the driving capacitor at different frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the dissipation was found to depend on the frequency as @xmath65 indicating that the main heat source are dielectric losses in the isolating materials of the capacitor . </S>",
    "<S> eddy current heating would be proportional to @xmath66 since the electromagnetic induction @xmath67 in the copper plate is proportional to the time derivative of the displacement current in the capacitor , @xmath68 , and the dissipation is proportional to @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> the heat released at the maximum frequency of 50hz and @xmath61v amplitude warmed the helium sample from 0.39mk to 0.40mk in about one minute . estimating the heat capacity of our 1mole helium sample at this temperature as @xmath70j@xmath71 we find a heat leak of @xmath72pw . </S>",
    "<S> this very small value of the heat leak should be compared with the heat leak from the interdigital capacitor in other works on crystallization waves in @xmath0he,@xcite where , extrapolated to our frequencies and voltage , it would be 70nw , i.  e.  more than three orders of magnitude larger . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for such a strong reduction of dissipation was , we believe , the use of a very tiny 6mm@xmath31 wound capacitor with a minimum possible amount of dielectric material .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , we have developed a new very sensitive technique for measuring oscillations of the solid - liquid interface of helium ( crystallization waves ) . </S>",
    "<S> this double - resonance technique has been demonstrated to detect amplitudes of surface oscillations as small as 1 . minimizing the dielectric losses in the capacitor resulted in very small power dissipation of 20pw . </S>",
    "<S> such an ultra - low - dissipation technique allows experiments with solid - liquid interface of helium-3 well below 0.5mk , where crystallization waves have been predicted to appear . </S>",
    "<S> the technique can also be used effectively to probe waves at the free surface of superfluid or at the interface between two different superfluid phases . </S>"
