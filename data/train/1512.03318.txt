    "while the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg)@xcite method was originally conceived as an algorithm for one - dimensional systems , it has shown tremendous success in exploring two - dimensional systems in recent years.@xcite the 2d dmrg method uses geometries such as a cylinder of finite circumference so that the quasi-2d problem can be mapped to a 1d one.@xcite despite the development of genuinely two - dimensional tensor network optimization algorithms,@xcite dmrg is still a standard method due to its reliability and stable convergence properties . especially in the very active field of topological phases , it has been successfully applied to identify quantum spin liquids,@xcite fractional quantum hall phases,@xcite and bosonic and fermionic fractional chern insulating states.@xcite    despite the improvements and successes of dmrg for ( quasi-)two - dimensional systems , calculations on cylinders or strips of large width remain an extremely challenging task . the main cause for this",
    "is rooted in the behavior of quantum entanglement , which is governed by the area law :  @xcite the computational cost in efficient dmrg implementations grows exponentially in the circumference ( but not length ) of the cylinder for gapped systems .",
    "progress has only been possible due to numerous improvements to the original algorithm .",
    "the inclusion of abelian and non - abelian symmetries,@xcite the introduction of single - site optimization with density matrix perturbation@xcite and the development of real - space parallelization@xcite have increased convergence speed and decreased the requirement of computational resources .",
    "an infinite version of the algorithm@xcite has facilitated the investigation of translationally invariant systems . while the barrier to larger circumferences is exponential , the accuracy also increases exponentially with circumference in a gapped system , so further optimizations of the dmrg are both highly desirable and worthwhile .    in this paper",

    "cylinder dmrg requires mapping the hilbert space of the cylinder to a 1d chain with sites indexed by @xmath2 .",
    "generally this is done by letting the 1d chain `` snake '' through the real - space sites of the 2d cylinder , as illustrated in fig .",

    "while keeping computational costs manageable , it is crucial to exploit symmetries of the hamiltonian .",
    "to a exploit a global symmetry @xmath3 in dmrg it must be onsite , meaning that its action factorizes across sites : @xmath4 charge conservation and spin - rotation are of this form .",
    "however , when snaking in real space , a rotation of the cylinder _ permutes _ the sites , so does not factorize as above , and can not be used to accelerate computations .    to bring a rotation of the cylinder into an onsite form we use a mixed real - space and momentum - space basis . in a fermion system ,",

    "we instead fourier transform the single particle orbitals in the direction around the cylinder and pass to the many - body basis @xmath6 .",
    "a crucial property of fermions is that the hard - core constraint is a direct consequence of the pauli - exclusion , so remains true in momentum space .",

    "the reason for the different dependence of these quantities on the bond dimension for low @xmath1 originates from the different representation of the state . since the direction around the cylinder is transformed into momentum space , the `` intra - ring entanglement '' within one ring of sites wrapping around the cylinder differs between the two methods .",
    "thus even though both methods have the same `` inter - ring entanglement '' between two halves of the infinite system for a cut between rings , the difference in `` intra - ring entanglement '' has a small effect both for the entanglement entropy and the energy of the states at lower bond dimensions .",

    "even though the interaction is significantly higher than the gap @xmath48 between the lowest and the second band , we expect the system to host a fractional chern insulator ( fci ) state for these parameter values since fci states have been shown to survive for interactions much larger than the band gap.@xcite in order to confirm the presence of the fci state , we compute the hall conductivity @xmath49 of the system .",
    "if there is a finite hall conductance @xmath49 , then adiabatically threading one flux quantum through the cylinder will pump the charge @xmath49 from the left to right half of the cylinder.@xcite thus , we adiabatically insert a flux through the system by twisting the boundary conditions and monitor the charge pumped into the left side of the system , as depicted in fig .",

    "if we assume each intermediate state type @xmath136 has an additional @xmath137-fold momentum label , a very crude upper bound for the mpo bond dimension is given by @xmath138 .",
    "this is considerably larger than in the real space case , but still linear in @xmath137 .",
    "however , the true dimensions of the matrices in the computation are much lower . due to momentum conservation ,",
    "many paths through the fsm are not allowed , and so at any specific site there are many unreachable intermediate states . as a result",
    ", a significant fraction of such fsm states may be eliminated , resulting in much fewer states . in the mpo language",
    "this means that the mpo matrices comprise many rows or columns that do not contain any non - zero entries .",
    "we may simply delete these from the matrices .",
    "note that in the real space version , no such rows or columns exist so that the size of the mpo can not be reduced further .",
    "in fact , after trimming the mpo dimension @xmath84 is significantly _ lower _ in the mixed space than in real space .",
    "we show a scaling of the mpo bond dimension , averaged over the unit cell , as a function of the cylinder circumference in fig .",
    "[ fig : mpo_scale](a ) .",
    "with the circumference @xmath137 of the cylinder . despite the additional complexity of the @xmath39-space mpo ,",
    "its bond dimension is smaller than that of the real space mpo .",
    "( b ) average ratio of the number of nonzero vs.  total number of entries in the mpo matrices for the real space and the exponential and sine / cosine formulation in mixed space .",
    "[ fig : mpo_scale ] ]    as described above , the mpo includes complex numbers @xmath139 .",
    "however , @xmath140 and @xmath141 always show up in pairs , as the matrix elements of @xmath142 are real - valued . using the identity",
    "@xmath143 we can further optimize the mpo . by replacing the complex exponentials with the corresponding sine and cosine terms , we are able to perform our numerical calculations exclusively using real numbers .",
    "( note that the hopping terms in eq .",
    "are real - valued in the @xmath39-space basis . )",
    "the off - diagonal terms in the rotation matrix of eq .   generate more transitions in the resulting fsm , hence more nonzero entries in the mpo matrices , but do not increase the mpo bond dimension . to illustrate the effect of the transformation on the fsm , we show the transformed version of the path from fig .  [",
    "fig : k_path](a ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : k_path](b ) .",
    "furthermore , we show the average sparsity of the different formulations in fig .",
    "[ fig : mpo_scale](b ) which may also serve as an indication of the computational complexity . in general ,",
    "the mpo matrices in real space are slightly sparser than in the mixed representation , but the difference decreases with increasing circumference .",
    "the transformation in mixed space does almost not affect the sparsity of the matrices .",
    "the mixed space approach for dmrg on cylinders introduced in this paper uses the momentum around the cylinder as an additional conserved quantity , greatly reducing the numerical effort of the method . applying the algorithm to the interacting fermionic hofstadter model , we have shown a speedup of up to 20 times in cpu time and up to 6 times reduced memory usage .",
    "in addition , the algorithm scales more favorably with the dmrg bond dimension @xmath1 , offering the prospect of an even increased speedup for larger @xmath1 .",
    "the drastically reduced computational cost suggests this approach could be a standard procedure when investigating fermionic lattice models with dmrg . with quantum monte carlo suffering from the sign - problem in these systems , dmrg is still one of the most reliable algorithms to investigate ground states of fermionic systems when going beyond system sizes accessible in exact diagonalization .",
    "an exciting future direction is to consider spinful hubbard models in mott insulating and fermi - liquid regimes.@xcite since the method allows us to reach much larger dmrg bond dimensions , a possible application is to detect exotic gapless non - fermi liquid phases by finite entanglement scaling ( fes).@xcite the possibility of extracting the central charge of a critical phase from fes can reveal non - fermi liquid behavior .",
    "@xcite    the extension of the method to bosonic systems remains an open issue requiring further investigation . since local interactions become non - local around the cylinder in the @xmath39-space representation , the onsite hilbert space in mixed space has to be larger than two even for hard - core bosons .",
    "the increase in the dimension of the local hilbert space will strongly affect the efficiency of the algorithm .",
    "for soft - core bosons where an artificial cutoff of the onsite hilbert space has to be performed even in real - space , we also expect that the effective hilbert space of a `` site '' in the mixed representation has to be larger to achieve the same accuracy of representing the state .",
    "while repulsive onsite interactions penalize a double occupancy in real space , this constraint is weakened due to the prefactor @xmath144 of the interaction terms in the mixed basis .",
