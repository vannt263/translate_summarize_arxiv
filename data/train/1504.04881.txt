    "we address the behavior of @xmath141 close to the band edges .",
    "first , note that @xmath91 is a decreasing odd function in @xmath20 , and @xmath70 is an even function in @xmath20 .",
    "close to the band edges , both @xmath91 and @xmath70 will always diverge as a square root , @xmath142 . whenever the gap is located at a @xmath143-symmetric point , where @xmath144 , the strengths of the divergences in @xmath91 and @xmath70 are equal . without loss of generality , to prove this we choose @xmath145 where the gap is located at @xmath146 .",
    "we expand @xmath147 around that point , @xmath148 the divergence of @xmath91 near the valence band edge can be isolated by integrating only over a small region @xmath149 around the top of the valence band for small @xmath150 , @xmath151 a similar argument applies to @xmath70 close to the valence band , as the magnitude of the gap @xmath152 .",
    "therefore @xmath70 and @xmath91 have exactly the same divergent behavior close to the band edge .",
    "hence , @xmath153 only diverges close to the valence band and @xmath154 diverges close to the conduction band .",
    "note that this analysis is valid for @xmath145 , when the band gap is at @xmath127 , and for @xmath155 , when the band gap is at @xmath128 .",
    "this implies that this cancellation of divergences is present in the trivial phase ( which supports the notion that there the eigenvalues do not change sign ) , but also for some region in the topological phase . when @xmath156 and @xmath157 , the gap is not located at a @xmath143-symmetric point but rather at @xmath158 or @xmath159 .",
    "in this case , the gap satisfies @xmath160 .",
    "this last one is important , because then at any @xmath143-symmetric point of @xmath47 , the eigenvalues of @xmath161 will both diverge to positive infinity at the valence band edge . to see that , we expand @xmath162 so that the divergent parts close to the valence band edge of the greens function terms are @xmath163 because @xmath164",
    ", we find that divergences do not cancel and both eigenvalues of @xmath165 will diverge to positive infinity at the valence band edge .",
    "this means that at the conduction band edge , both diverge to negative infinity , therefore implying an energy at which @xmath166 has zero eigenvalues .",
    "let us shorty address the fate of codimension-1 magnetic impurities . in this case ,",
    "tr invariance does not constrain the specific structure of the @xmath4-matrix .",
    "let us , however , focus on the simplest case : @xmath169 .",
    "we assume the impurity line orientation to be the @xmath101-direction , so that in @xmath53 we have @xmath170 in addition , we assume the following impurity shape @xmath171 which differentiates between the parallel @xmath172 and perpendicular @xmath173 magnetization directions .",
    "the resulting structure has some nice analytic properties .",
    "in particular , it follows from      that for every eigenvalue @xmath175 there is also an eigenvalue @xmath176 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath177 for a given @xmath20 , then there is also a solution at @xmath178 . we thus conclude that impurity bands resulting from magnetic impurities are symmetric in energy .",
    "this is corroborated with explicit tight - binding results in final section of this appendix .    in the special case where the magnetic impurity is aligned to the impurity , effectively setting @xmath179 to zero ,",
    "the eigenvalues simplify as @xmath180 which is just @xmath181 times the solution for the identity matrix impurity , @xmath182 .",
    "hence , in these cases one just retrieves a doubling of the results found in the case of nonmagnetic impurities .",
    "we here corroborate the ideas of the main text with the specific arguments , showing that @xmath96 in two dimensions has zero eigenvalues in the topological regime . from eq .",
    ", it follows that @xmath107 and @xmath108 close to the valence band .",
    "if the gap is not at a @xmath143-symmetric point , this automatically implies that the divergences do not cancel and we are left with eigenvalues that all diverge at both band edges , leading to the fact that the greens functions eigenvalues have to be zero somewhere in the gap .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the gap is at a symmetric point we need an extra argument to show the result of fig .",
    "[ d-2imp ] , hence consider @xmath183 .",
    "trivially , @xmath184 for @xmath185 and @xmath186 . at the same time , we know that both @xmath103 and @xmath187 have a logarithmic divergence at the valence band .",
    "however , the difference is that because @xmath188 , the function @xmath103 goes to minus infinity . at the same time , @xmath102 goes to plus infinity because in that case the numerator is @xmath189 .",
    "thus the two lines must cross if @xmath190 , and consequently there is a point where @xmath141 has zero eigenvalues .",
    "it remains to prove that , in this construction , @xmath191 for @xmath183 .",
    "this actually straightforward . since @xmath192",
    "we directly infer that @xmath193 for all @xmath194 given @xmath195 , and hence @xmath191 in the desired region @xmath183 .      the main consequence of the difference in structure of @xmath0 in the trivial and topological regime is reflected in the formation of bound states in the gap between the two relevant topologically active bands .",
    "as this provides for a derived experimental signature , let us therefore corroborate the results with explicit tight - binding calculations .",
    "[ v=-6plot ] shows the results for the two dimensional @xmath196 model in presence of a codimension-1 impurity given by the identity matrix with strength @xmath197 in units of @xmath198 .",
