    "numerical simulation in the short - time regime has become an important tool to study phase transitions and critical phenomena .",
    "the reason is that universality and scaling behavior are already present in the dynamic systems since the early stages of their evolution @xcite .",
    "moreover , this kind of approach reveals the existence of a new and unsuspected critical exponent . as shown by janssen _",
    "et al._@xcite on basis of renormalization group theory , if we tune the parameters at their critical values but with initial configurations characterized by nonequilibrium states , the time evolution of quantities like magnetization exhibit a polynomial behavior governed by an exponent @xmath2 , which is independent of the known set of static exponents and of the dynamical critical exponent @xmath3 .",
    "this new exponent characterizes the so called `` critical initial slip '' , the anomalous behavior of the magnetization when the system is quenched to the critical temperature @xmath4 . working with systems",
    "without conserved quantities , model a in the terminology of halperin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , janssen _",
    "et al . _ found a scaling form for the moments of the magnetization , which sets soon after a microscopic time scale @xmath5 .",
    "those relations have been confirmed in several numerical experiments @xcite . for the @xmath6 moment of the magnetization",
    ", this scaling form reads @xmath7 here @xmath8 is an arbitrary spatial scaling factor , @xmath9 is the time evolution and @xmath10 is the reduced temperature , @xmath11 . as usual , the exponents @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the well - known static exponents , whereas @xmath3 is the dynamic one . equation ( [ magk ] ) depends on the initial magnetization @xmath14 and gives origin to the new exponent @xmath15 , the scaling dimension of the initial magnetization , related to @xmath2 by @xmath16 .    for a large lattice size @xmath17 and small initial magnetization @xmath18 ,",
    "the system in its early stage presents small spatial and temporal correlation lengths , which may eliminate usual finite size problems . in this limit , if we choose the scaling factor @xmath19 @xcite at the critical temperature ( @xmath20 ) , we obtain @xmath21 from the scaling relation ( [ magk ] ) . the exponent @xmath22 has been calculated for the two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xcite and three - dimensional ( 3d ) @xcite ising models , 2d 3-state potts model @xcite , ising model with next - nearest neighbor interactions @xcite and ising model with a line of defects @xcite . in addition , this short - time universal behavior was found in irreversible models with synchronous @xcite and continuous time dynamics @xcite . in all of those cases ,",
    "a positive value for @xmath22 has been found , that indicates a surprising initial increasing of the magnetization in the short - time regime @xmath23 .",
    "this effect can be related to a `` mean field '' behavior since the system presents small correlation length in the beginning of the time evolution .",
    "thus , when the system is quenched to the critical temperature @xmath4 , it feels as being in an ordered state since @xmath24 @xcite .    on the other hand , as shown by janssen and oerding @xcite , the behavior of a thermodynamic system is more complex at a tricritical point ( tp ) and the corresponding exponent @xmath2 may attain negative values .    at a tricritical point",
    "the magnetization shows a crossover from the logarithmic behavior @xmath25 at short times @xmath26 to @xmath27 power law with logarithmic corrections , @xmath28 in 3 dimensions .",
    "the above behavior can be stated in the generalized form @xmath29 where @xmath30 or @xmath31 , respectively for vanishing and large arguments . below 3 dimensions it reduces to the scaling form @xmath32 here",
    "@xmath2 is the exponent related to the tricritical point of the relaxation process at early times and it is expected to assume negative values .    in this paper , we perform short - time monte carlo ( mc ) simulations to explore the critical dynamics of the 2d blume - capel model .",
    "we evaluate the dynamic exponents @xmath2 and @xmath3 , besides the static exponents @xmath33 and @xmath34 at the tricritical point . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this is the first time it is done numerically .",
    "we also estimate the dynamic exponents along the critical line .",
    "we observe a clear trend toward the values of @xmath3 and @xmath2 for the corresponding 2d ising values when the crystal field @xmath35 becomes large and negative , indicating dynamic universality in the limit @xmath36 .",

    "the blume - capel @xcite ( bc ) model is a spin-1 model which has been used to describe the behavior of @xmath37 mixtures along the @xmath38 line and near the critical mixing point .",
    "apart from its practical interest , the bc model has intrinsic interest since it is the simplest generalization of the ising model ( @xmath39 ) exhibiting a rich phase diagram with first and second - order transition lines besides a tricritical point . in real systems",
    "tricritical points appear in @xmath37 mixtures , such that when a small fraction of @xmath40 is added to @xmath41 , a critical line terminates at a concentration of @xmath40 approximately at @xmath42 . the bc model or its well known generalization , the blume - emery - grifftihs model @xcite was studied by mean - field approximation , real space and renormalization group schemes @xcite , monte carlo renormalization group approach @xcite and finite - size scaling combined with conformal invariance @xcite .",
