    "to implement our proposal , it is necessary to use two - level atoms with coherence times longer than the combined duration of the ase and rase fields .",
    "this could be achieved using the long coherence time of rare - earth doped solids  @xcite or by using raman transitions in atomic gases  @xcite .",
    "operation with the cavity impedance matched in region 2 requires either some way of changing the atom oscillator strength , such as the four - level scheme of  @xcite , or a @xmath66-switched cavity because , in order not to cross the lasing threshold , @xmath131 is required in region 1 . in the case of the four - level scheme",

    "the cavity finesses required for implementation are only moderate , being no larger than that required to achieve impedance matching .",
    "this does not pose a great challenge , since the atomic absorption can be made much larger than the limit of current cavity decay rates .",
    "the bandwidth of the output light is determined by either the cavity linewidth or the width of the inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "we will only be interested in a band of this light that is narrow compared to @xmath133 , since adiabatic elimination of the cavity dynamics is only valid for such a range .",
    "filtering this narrowband signal from the full bandwidth of the output light can be achieved in a number of ways .",
    "the easiest to implement is homodyne or heterodyne detection  @xcite . in this way",
    "the filtering problem is reduced to filtering electrical signals .",
    "this method is suitable for quantum repeaters using a continuous variable basis  @xcite . for quantum repeaters using a discrete fock basis , filtering using standard techniques such as fabry - prot etalons is a possibility , and when using rare - earth ions one can also use the array of narrow band filtering techniques recently developed based on spectral holeburning  @xcite .",
    "it has been assumed that the rephasing @xmath0-pulse is a perfect @xmath0-pulse .",
    "the feasibility of applying a @xmath0-pulse to the whole ensemble is greatly helped by the area theorem  @xcite , which states that a @xmath0-pulse will remain a @xmath0-pulse as it travels through resonant media .",
    "this has strong analogues in a cavity  @xcite . of course , in practice",
    "the @xmath0-pulse wo nt be perfect .",
    "an imperfect @xmath0 pulse can be considered as a combination of a perfect @xmath0 pulse and a small perturbing pulse .",
    "the small perturbing pulse adds unwanted excitation to the atomic field , which adds noise to the rase field .",
    "however , as discussed in  @xcite , this noise disappears shortly after the @xmath0 pulse , since the unwanted excitation of the atomic field will be temporally brief and will rapidly dephase and no longer interact with the cavity mode .",
    "the variation in driving strength of the atoms due to variations in the cavity mode field intensity could be removed using hole burning techniques  @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have analysed rephased amplified spontaneous emission with the atoms placed in an optical cavity .",
    "the cavity can alleviate the problem of low recall efficiency , particularly if the cavity is impedance matched when the entangled light is being recalled from the atoms , in which case the recall will theoretically be perfect . achieving the impedance matched condition during recall requires either a @xmath66-switched cavity or some way of switching the atoms oscillator strengths , such as in the four - level scheme of beavan et al .",
    "@xcite , since the ase field has to be produced below the lasing threshold .",
    "we have also shown that entanglement exists between the ase and rase fields for all valid parameter values .",
    "theoretically , our system has the potential to achieve time - separated entanglement with perfect recall efficiency , which is indispensable in producing an effective quantum repeater .",
