    "in this exploratory simulation studies , we use factorial moments as a tool to segregrate @xmath0-ray and proton initiated showers .",
    "extensive air showers ( eas ) are produced when vhe / uhe primary photons , protons and other high z nuclei enter atmosphere from the top and produce cherenkov radiation which can be studied by imaging technique or by measuring lateral distribution . in the hillas parameterization approach",
    ", image is approximated as an ellipse and parmeters like image `` shape '' and `` orientation '' are calculated .",
    "hillas paramaters like @xmath1,@xmath2,@xmath3,@xmath4,@xmath5 etc . are essentially set of second order moments . among these parameters",
    "`` width '' and `` alpha '' are known to be very powerful parameters for segregation of @xmath0-ray initiated cherenkov photon from cosmic ray background . using this approach , present day @xmath0-ray telescope",
    "have been able to reject cosmic ray background events up to 99.5 @xmath6 level , while retaining upto 50 @xmath6 of the @xmath0-ray events from a point source .",
    "hillas parameters are found to be good classifiers for small images ( close to telescope threshold energies ) but fail for large images ( of higher primary energy ) as too many pixels are part of the image .",
    "again for gev energy region telescopes like magic and mace , hillas parameters alone are not very attractive .",
    "a loss of 50 @xmath6 of actual image due to parameterization is also a big constraint .",
    "hence the idea of trying factorial moments as a possible tool is a subject matter of this paper .",
    "a given image is divided into m equal bins of width d. if @xmath7 is the number of particles in the mth bin , quantity @xmath8 can be defined as @xmath9 and calculated for each bin .",
    "the standard moments are defined as @xmath10 the normalized factorial moments are @xmath11 where n is the total number of photoelectrons in the image .",
    "factorial moment has a power law dependence @xmath12",
    "for the present studies simulatons were carried out using corsika [ 1](version 5.6211 ) along with egs4 , venus , gheisha codes for chenenkov option .",
    "simulated data is generated for 208 elements of tactic [ 2 ] configuration , each element of the size 4 m @xmath13 4 m .",
    "simulated data corresponds to mt.abu altitude ( 1300 m ) and appropriate magnetic field .",
    "cherenkov databases correspond to wavelength band of 300 - 450 nm .",
    "simulated databases have been subjected to atmospheric absorption . for realistic simulation studies of tactic array , photoelectron content of each pixel",
    "is modified to include shot noise contribution from night sky background . a noise profile based on actual experimental conditions",
    "is superimposed on each image .",
    "h        in this studies 15800 cherenkov images each corresponding to @xmath0-ray ( 1 tev ) and proton ( 2 tev ) initiated showers are considered .",
    "the innermost pixels of the camera generate low level gamma ray threshold triggers using 3nct ( nearest neighbour non - collinear triplets ) topological trigger configuration [ 3 ] . only those images are selected which satisfy 3nct trigger configuration with the condition that there are minimum of 6 photoelectrons in each pixel . by applying 3nct criteria a total of 5300 @xmath0-ray images and 2407 proton images",
    "are obtained .",
    "hillas parameters and factorial moments have been obtained for these chosen images .",
    "cherenkov images of @xmath0-ray showers are mainly elliptical in shape , hence compact . however , the cherenkov images of hadronic showers are mostly irregular in shape . for all cherenkov images ,",
    "shape parametes like length , width and distance and orientation parameters like @xmath14 , azwidth and miss are calculated .",
    "it is observed that width and @xmath14 parameters have strong segregation capability.for all cherenkov images factorial moments @xmath15 of order",
    "i ( i=2,3,4,5,6 ) have been calculated .. it is observed that factorial moment of fifth and sixth order are very powerful parameters to segregate @xmath0-rays from protons .",
    "we have used artificial neural network ( ann ) for event classification .",
    "figure 1 shows ann output with only hillas parameters ( width and @xmath14 ) as ann inputs .",
    "figure 2 displays ann output with fifth and sixth order factorial moments as ann inputs . only those images with fifth order and sixth order moments greater than 4000 have been considered .",
    "figure 3 depicts ann output with hillas parameters and factorial moments ( 5th and 6th order only ) together as ann inputs .",
    "it is clear that factorial moments are very powerful parameters and combine very well with hillas parameterization for segregation of @xmath0-rays from protons .",
