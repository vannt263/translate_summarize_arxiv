    "it was first noted by alexander  f.  andreev 50 years ago that the interface between a metal and a superconductor can retro - reflect an incident electron as a positive charged hole , while the missed charges enter the superconductor as a cooper pair , thereafter called andreev reflection ( ar ) .",
    "@xcite since its disclosure , the ar has never stopped surprising us with new phenomena , such as a zero - bias conductance peak  @xcite in @xmath0-wave superconductors , non - local crossed ar ,  @xcite specular ar in dirac materials ,  @xcite majorana fermions formed by exotic andreev bound states in topological superconductors  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we report a new phenomenon related to ar , that is , the asymmetric andreev reflection ( aar ) in anisotropic superconductors is able to induce electric and thermal hall - like effects , in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "@xcite    conventionally , various classical and quantum hall effects arise in the presence of magnetic orders , like magnetization and an external magnetic field . in other words ,",
    "hall effects usually require broken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "one exception is the various spin - related hall effects with spin - orbital - like interactions in the absence of magnetic fields ,  @xcite which can occur with the time - reversal symmetry preserved because the spin current is even under time - reversal operation .",
    "a recent study also showed that with the application of space - time dependent potentials on a dirac material , a hall - like charge current emerges .",
    "@xcite in addition , the hall - like thermoelectric transport is also proposed as a new and promising direction for microscale and cryogenic peltier cooling ,  @xcite wherein a longitudinal electric current generates a transverse heat current without a magnetic field .",
    "the aar that we uncover here provides a novel mechanism for hall - like transverse charge and heat transports , in spite of the fact that the transverse momentum is conserved across the junction .",
    "it has direct implications for transverse microscale and cryogenic peltier cooling .",
    "the aar - induced hall - like effects do not require broken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "they result from the breaking mirror symmetry with respect to the interface normal due to the anisotropic pairing of the superconductor .",
    "[ 0.31]-wave symmetry.,title=\"fig : \" ]    let us consider a two - dimensional metal / superconductor ( n / s ) junction , with the @xmath1-direction translational invariant interface located at @xmath2 , which is assumed to be the only boundary of the problem .",
    "therefore , we analyze the bulk transport , where the elementary ( quasi-)particles with energy @xmath3 are described by the bogoliubov - de gennes equation  @xcite @xmath4 with the total hamiltonian @xmath5 @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the electron - like and hole - like components of the wave function , respectively .",

    "@xcite note that in the weak coupling limit , the superconducting coherence length is much larger than the fermi wavelength ,  @xcite @xmath15 .",
    "we consider the s side to have a @xmath0-wave pairing symmetry , representative of anisotropic superconductors , and assume electrons to be injected from the n side with incoming angle @xmath16 and energy @xmath17 measured from @xmath11 . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] , the reflection at the interface is either a normal specular - reflection with amplitude @xmath18 or an andreev retro - reflection , converting electrons to holes , with amplitude @xmath19 . the transmitted electron- and hole - like quasiparticles experience two different values of pair potential , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , with amplitudes @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , where @xmath24 is the maximum of the angle - dependent superconducting gap and @xmath25 denotes the mis - oriented angle between the crystal axis of the @xmath26-wave superconductor and the normal direction of the interface .    for both reflection and transmission processes , the transverse ( @xmath1-direction ) momentum parallel to the interface is conserved across the interface .",
    "@xcite therefore , for incident electrons with vanishing @xmath1-momentum on average over @xmath16 , one would never expect that a nonvanishing transverse transport emerges .",
    "therefore , the conventional wisdom ( as , indeed , is the case in the literature and textbooks ) has never considered hall transports in the absence of a magnetic field since the disclosure of ar a half - century ago .",
    "@xcite this situation remains even after the discovery of anisotropic superconductors .",
    "however , as we show below , @xmath27 as a peculiar feature of anisotropic superconductors gives rise to the aar amplitude @xmath28 , which subsequently induces the anomalous electric and thermal hall - like effects in the transverse direction .",
    "we exemplify these aar - induced hall - like effects in both a nonrelativistic and a relativistic case , adapting the andreev condition @xmath29 without loss of generality .      for the nonrelativistic case where the n side is a normal metal with the s side a superconductor",

    "the opposite signs before @xmath49 in @xmath50 and @xmath51 indicate that the ar blocks ( retro - reflects ) the energy transport but transmits the charge by generating a copper pair on the s side .",
    "the positive @xmath52 implies that the specular normal reflection transmits the @xmath1-component of both energy and electric currents .",
    "the last term @xmath53 $ ] results from the interference between the incident wave and the normal reflected one , which produces transverse currents that are oscillatory - dependent on the @xmath54-position .",
    "however , as we will see , after considering all the possibilities of the incoming angle @xmath16 , all the terms containing @xmath55 will vanish and only the term containing ar @xmath44 will survive .",
    "the normal reflection can not provide the transverse transport on average , but the aar can .",
    "in fact , if we follow ref .",

    ". therefore , aar plays a crucial role in the hall - like effect in anisotropic superconductors .      for the relativistic case ,",
    "the n side is a dirac material such as graphene or the metallic surface of a topological insulator , and the s side is the corresponding superconductor .",
    "taking the latter ( the metallic surface of a topological insulator ) for example , we have @xmath67 acting on the nambu basis @xmath68 and @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the fermi velocity and @xmath71 denote pauli matrices .",
    "@xcite using graphene will make a small difference in the mathematical representation , but the physics and final results will not change .",

    ". moreover , @xmath84 $ ] is antisymmetric ( odd function ) with respect to @xmath16 so that after integration its contribution is 0 as well .",
    "however , @xmath88 is not equal to @xmath89 generally so that @xmath90 survives after angle averaging .",
    "therefore , only the aar is able to contribute to the emergence of transverse hall - like currents .      from the above discussion , we know that normal reflection does not play any role in the possible hall - like effects . after considering all possible incident angles",
    ", we then have the expressions of the total transverse hall - like current densities for both nonrelativistic and relativistic cases : @xmath91 to observe these transverse hall - like transport properties , the crystalline angle of the anisotropic superconductor should be oriented to avoid the integral multiple of @xmath92 so that the angle - dependent superconducting gap @xmath93 as well as the ar @xmath49 is asymmetric with respect to the normal incident angle @xmath94 [ see fig .  [ fig : nhall](a ) and ( b ) ] .",
    "this actually indicates that the mirror symmetry breaking with respect to the interface normal is required for manifestation of the aar - induced hall - like currents .",
    "the induced hall - like effects are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : nhall](c ) .",
    "with increasing the energy , the electric and thermal hall - like effects decrease to 0 because the ar tends to disappear when the quasiparticle energy is much beyond the superconducting gap .",
    "the opposite sign between @xmath95 and @xmath96 is a consequence of the electron - hole converting nature of ar , wherein the reflected holes carry energy and charge currents in opposite directions .",
    "as we show below , these two quantities are also the differential conductances at voltage bias @xmath97 at low temperatures .    [ 0.36 ] , for @xmath98 ( solid line ) , @xmath99 ( dashed line ) , and @xmath100 ( dash - dotted line ) .",
    "( c ) transverse thermal and electric currents as a function of energy .",
    "( d ) thermal hall conductance as a function of temperature .",
    "other parameters are @xmath101 , and @xmath102 .",
    "we set @xmath103 , so that both nonrelativistic and relativistic cases have @xmath104 and behave the same .",
    "the constant @xmath105 is normalized.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the conventional btk formula  @xcite concerning the longitudinal electric current , reads @xmath106 , with @xmath107 being the total longitudinal electric current density and @xmath105 the density of states near the fermi level , which can be pulled out of the integral in the wide band approximation .",
    "clearly , all incoming currents from the n side have the fermi distribution function @xmath108^{-1}$ ] , while those coming in from the s side are weighted by @xmath109^{-1}$ ] .",
    "similarly , the transverse current contributed by the left - to - right current will be ( partially ) canceled by the opposite one contributed by the right - to - left current .",
    "therefore , for the hall - like electric current , we have a similar expression : @xmath110 the longitudinal heat current has a similar btk - type expression :  @xcite @xmath111 with @xmath112 being the total longitudinal energy current density .",
    "accordingly , the transverse hall - like heat current reads similarly : @xmath113    equations  ( [ eq : electronhall ] ) and ( [ eq : heathall ] ) indicate that the electric and thermal hall - like effects are observable under the nonequilibrium condition @xmath114 with either nonzero longitudinal voltage bias @xmath115 or thermal bias @xmath116 .",
    "let us first examine the effect of voltage bias without thermal bias . in this case , at low temperatures , we get the differential hall conductances @xmath117 and @xmath118 , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nhall](c ) . strictly speaking",
    ", the transverse heat current @xmath119 induced by the longitudinal voltage bias under a magnetic field is called the ettingshausen effect . here , it is evident that even in the absence of a magnetic field , the aar is able to induce the ettingshausen - like effect .",
    "we then turn to examine the effect of thermal bias without voltage bias .",
    "because of the aar - induced ettingshausen - like effect discussed above , one may expect that the aar can also induce the reversed process , nernst - like effect , which is the transverse electric current @xmath120 induced by the longitudinal thermal bias .",
    "however , due to the electron - hole symmetry of the ar , i.e. , @xmath121 , it is straightforward to prove that eq .",
    "( [ eq : electronhall ] ) is always 0 with only thermal bias @xmath116 , because @xmath122 is an odd function of @xmath3 so that its integral over @xmath3 vanishes",
    ". therefore , the aar - induced nernst - like effect is absent .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , the thermal hall - like effect still survives , that is , the longitudinal thermal bias is able to induce the transverse heat current @xmath119 .",
    "the corresponding thermal hall conductance @xmath123}$ ] is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : nhall](d ) .",
    "we here ignore the temperature dependence of @xmath24 : the higher the temperature the smaller @xmath24 . if considering such temperature dependence , the decrease in @xmath124 at high temperatures will be more pronounced .",
    "finally , we find that tuning the interface barrier is able to reverse the direction of hall - like effects because the barrier influences the weight of ar amplitude @xmath125 at positive and negative angles so that the angle integral of @xmath126 may change the sign . for the nonrelativistic case , when increasing the barrier strength @xmath86 , the hall - like effects first reverse their directions and then vanish to 0 because at large barrier the ar diminishes [ left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : z ] ] .",
    "however , the direction and magnitude of hall - like effects in the relativistic case show periodic oscillating behaviors via increasing @xmath86 [ right panel in fig .  [",
    "fig : z ] ] .",
    "the oscillating behavior of the hall - like effects as a function of the barrier @xmath86 is a manifestation of klein tunneling in relativistic transport .",
    "@xcite in addition , we note that the direction and magnitude of these electric and thermal hall - like effects can also be tuned by changing either the crystal axis angle @xmath25 or equivalently the range of incident angles .",
    "[ 0.42 ]  and  @xmath127 , the bias @xmath128 is fixed . when calculating @xmath129 , @xmath130 is fixed .",
    "other parameters are @xmath101 , and @xmath102 , with @xmath105 normalized.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "in summary , we have revealed that the aar in anisotropic superconductors is able to induce electric and thermal hall - like effects , in the absence of a magnetic field . a longitudinal electric voltage or temperature bias can induce transverse electric or thermal currents merely through the aar , respectively . in particular , a transverse thermoelectric effect ,",
    "i.e. , the ettingshausen - like effect , has been identified , which has direct implications in transverse cryogenic peltier cooling .",
    "@xcite the direction change of these electric and thermal hall - like currents has also been discussed .",
    "the hall - like effects discussed here do not require the conventional time - reversal symmetry breaking , but result from the mirror symmetry breaking with respect to the interface normal due to the anisotropic paring symmetry of the superconductor .",
    "the spin - orbital interaction in the relativistic case is not crucial for the hall - like effects , since the nonrelativistic case without spin - orbital interaction behaves similarly , except for the relativistic klein tunneling effect .",
    "the aar - induced hall effects are observable under the condition that the crystal axis of the anisotropic superconductor is mirror - symmetry - broken , once the ar is significant .",
    "in fact , the @xmath0-wave ar has been widely observed in various experiments at metal / high @xmath131 superconductor junctions ,  @xcite even with imperfect , rough interfaces .",
    "moreover , for the relativistic case ( such as graphene or the metallic surface of topological insulators ) , the imperfect interface will generally become transparent without severely affecting transport thanks to the klein tunneling , see fig .  [",
    "fig : z ] .",
    "we thus believe aar - induced hall - like effects can be readily observed , once researchers turn their attention to the @xmath1-direction transport induced by ar .",
    "although we focus only on the n / s junction here , it would be interesting to explore the similar hall - like josephson supercurrent at s / n / s junctions with unconventional superconducting pairing symmetry .",
    "@xcite in fact , a recent experiment  @xcite measured the quantum hall effect in nano - sized graphene with superconducting electrodes under a strong magnetic field . in such experiments without an applied magnetic field , when one of the s parts is replaced with an anisotropic superconductor , we expect to observe an aar - induced hall - like supercurrent , if the hall bar measurement setup is added .",
    "we caution that the present work is limited to the ballistic transport regime , since we have applied the scattering wave approach in the noninteracting single particle picture . as such , the studies are applicable to a clean sample , or a nano - sized junction ( see ref .  ) with weak impurities , where the mean free paths of carriers are larger than the system size so that the transport is effectively ballistic .",
    "the impacts of impurities , disorders , and many - body interactions on the @xmath1-directional transverse transport are still open questions and the effect of the ballistic - diffusion crossover on the aar - induced hall - like effects is unclear ; these topics should deserve further detailed investigations .",
    "also , it would be interesting to explore the possible quantization effect for transverse transport by constraining the @xmath1-direction within a finite small width .",
