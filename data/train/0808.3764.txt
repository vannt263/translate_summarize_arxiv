    "in 2005 , the bes collaboration announced the observation of a resonant state termed x(1835 ) in the reaction @xmath7 , @xmath8  @xcite . a fit to this resonance with the breit - wigner function",
    "yields the quantum number @xmath9 and mass @xmath10mev , width @xmath11mev and the product branching fraction @xmath12 .",
    "actually , without include the final state interaction , the parameters of this resonance have been fitted to be @xmath13 and the total width @xmath14 in ref .  @xcite . since the discovery of the x(1835 ) state , many models have been proposed to explain its properties  @xcite .    in the previous works ,",
    "the x(1835 ) state has been conjectured to be a baryonium state  @xcite , pseudoscalar glueball state  @xcite and also a radial excitation of @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "although there are many speculations , none of the above claims can be either confirmed or ruled out by the present experiments . in our present work ,",
    "we have calculated the strong decays of @xmath16 and radiative decay of @xmath1 using the effective lagrangian formalism by treating the x(1835 ) as a @xmath17 baryonium .",
    "this seems to be a reasonable approximation if one only considers the fact that the mass of the x(1835 ) is bit lower than the threshold energy of @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( about 40 mev ) .",
    "our philosophy is that , assuming the x(1835 ) as a baryonium , if we can get the numerical results agree with the observed data the baryonium assumption is reasonable otherwise the baryonium picture can be ruled out , at least in this framework .",
    "the coupling of the x(1835 ) to its constituents can be described by the effective lagrangian .",
    "the corresponding effective coupling constant @xmath20 is determined by the compositeness condition @xmath21 which was earlier used by nuclear physicists  @xcite and is being widely used by particle physicists ( see the references in  @xcite ) .",
    "we had applied the above method to study the newly observed charmed mesons  @xcite and their decay properties which we had obtained agreed with the observed data .",
    "we had also employed the above technique to predict the decay properties of the bottom - strange mesons  @xcite . in our present work ,",
    "we have used a typical scale parameter @xmath22 to describe the finite size of the baryonium .",
    "the value of @xmath22 is fixed by considering the coupling constant @xmath20 is expected to be stable . for other interactions , we have used the phenomenological lagrangian and have borrowed the relevant coupling constants from the existing literature . using the above phenomenological approaches , we have analyzed the strong decays of @xmath23 and radiative decay of @xmath1 .",
    "the result of the decay width of @xmath24 is much smaller than the observed data hence the x(1835 ) can not be treated as a baryonium .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : in section [ theofram ] , we have calculated the effective coupling constant @xmath20 using the compositeness condition and have discussed the effective lagrangian formalism employed in our calculation . in section [ strongem ]",
    "we have calculated the strong decay widths of @xmath25 and radiative decay width of @xmath1 using the effective coupling constant @xmath20 and effective lagrangian proposed in section [ theofram ] . in section [ discon ]",
    "the important results and conclusions have been given .",
    "in this section we give the formulation for the study of the x(1835 ) as a baryonium state which can be thought of as a @xmath26 bound state .",
    "as stated earlier , the mass of the x(1835 ) is around @xmath27mev less than the threshold of @xmath26 .",
    "the quantum number of the x(1835 ) is assigned to be @xmath9 , and its mass is predicted to be @xmath28 mev  @xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangian describing the interaction between the x(1835 ) and its constituents is given by @xmath29 where the baryon doublet @xmath30 is defined as @xmath31 the correlation function @xmath32 characterizes the finite size of the x(1835 ) as a @xmath17 bound state and depends on the relative jacobi coordinates @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in the limit @xmath35 , the interaction given by eq .",
    "( [ leffxnn ] ) becomes local .",
    "the fourier transform of the correlation function @xmath36 is @xmath37 in following calculation , an explicit form of @xmath38 has been used .",
    "the choice of @xmath38 should be such that it falls off sufficiently fast in the ultraviolet region of euclidean space to render the feynman diagrams finite in the uv region . in this sense",
    ", one can also regard @xmath38 as a regulator for the loop integral . in our work",
    ", we have chosen the gaussian form for @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the euclidean jacobi momentum . here",
    "@xmath22 is a size parameter which parameterizes the distribution of @xmath30 and @xmath41 baryons inside the x(1835 ) baryonium .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath42 is determined by the compositeness condition  @xcite which implies that the renormalization constant of the hadron wave function is set to zero @xmath43 here , @xmath44 is the derivative of the mass operator @xmath45 which is represented by the diagrams in fig .  [ fig : massoperator ] given below .",
    "the compositeness condition can be understood in the following : the renormalization constant @xmath46 can be interpreted as the matrix element between the physical state x(1835 ) and corresponding bare state @xmath47 , i.e. , @xmath48 , so that @xmath49 means that the physical state should not be a function of the corresponding bare state which means that the physical state is a bound state . in our present work , the x(1835 ) is a bound state of @xmath26 . in this sense , the compositeness condition excludes the possibility of the processes involving the x(1835 ) as an initial or a final state since each external x(1835 ) contributes a factor @xmath50 to the relevant matrix elements .",
    "in addition , because of the interaction between the x(1835 ) and its constituents , the mass and wave function of the x(1835 ) have to be renormalized .",
