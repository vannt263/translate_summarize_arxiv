    "enzymatic sites containing transition metals are among the most relevant biophysical systems currently studied using first - principles quantum mechanical approaches .",
    "the application of such tools , however , is often severely limited as a consequence of the inability of conventional electronic structure methods  such as hartree - fock or density - functional theory  to provide a qualitatively correct description of the spin - state energetics of the metal center .",
    "iron porphyrins , which constitute the prosthetic group of the ubiquitous heme proteins , are a paradigmatic example where the aforementioned approaches can not be relied upon to predict the ground state multiplicity of the system .",
    "the spin state of iron porphyrins , as much as the spin state of any transition metal complex , is determined by the coordination symmetry and the nature of the ligands .",
    "the three lowest accessible spin states ( a singlet , a triplet and a quintuplet if the number of electrons is even , or a doublet , a quartet and a sextet if it is odd ) are conventionally referred to as low , intermediate , and high - spin . in unligated porphyrins the metal",
    "is coordinated to four in - plane nitrogen atoms , and experimental studies on model compounds , namely on fe(ii ) tetraphenylporphine ( fetpp ) , indicate for this coordination mode a triplet ground state.@xcite@xmath0@xcite additional axial ligands produce alternative multiplicities : imidazole gives rise to high spin hemes , while strong ligand - fields as that of diatomic molecules like co , no or o@xmath1 , favor low spin configurations.@xcite six coordinated hemes , with two axial ligands , usually exhibit a low spin state unless the ligand - field is extremely weak .",
    "[ dorbitals ] depicts a schematic view of the d - states energy levels in three distinctive coordination environments .    even though first - principles approaches , specifically hartree - fock ( hf ) and density - functional theory ( dft ) , greatly contributed to the interpretation and understanding of the functional aspects of the active site of heme proteins at the molecular level , attempts to predict the ground state multiplicity of these systems soon made apparent that an accurate description of the electronic structure might require more sophisticated techniques .",
    "this fact can be tracked down to the spin - transition energies provided by hf and dft for isolated iron atoms and ions or different iron compounds , where it has been systematically observed that hf favors high - spin electronic configurations while dft exhibits a preference for low - spin states.@xcite@xmath0@xcite such biases are similarly manifested in heme complexes : table i summarizes this trend in five and six coordinated iron porphines ( fep ) .    for the last decade dft",
    "has been the first method of choice to perform electronic structure calculations of biological models , and in particular of heme systems . in this context",
    ", one of the most crucial failures of common exchange - correlation functionals has been detected in the deoxygenated active site of hemoglobin and myoglobin ( table i ) .",
    "the earliest study reporting this flaw is due to rovira @xmath2,@xcite who obtained for the five coordinated model fe@xmath3p(im ) ( axial ligand : imidazole ) a triplet state 6.5 kcal / mol below the quintuplet , which is the experimental ground state of the system . after this work ,",
    "a few others followed which also observed this inversion using b3lyp or different pure gga functionals.@xcite liao and scheiner claimed to have found a quintuplet ground state for this five coordinated compound employing a dft - gga functional.@xcite in their calculations , however , electronic symmetry constraints were imposed . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "dft functionals yield for fe@xmath3p(im ) a triplet ground state in the absence of symmetry constraints . in an effort to quantify the errors in the dft estimates of spin transition energies , ghosh and taylor resorted to highly - correlated techniques as caspt2 and ccsd(t ) to explore the iron ( iii ) porphyrin chloride.@xcite",
    "this is another example of a high spin five coordinated heme complex for which dft predicts a quartet favored over the sextet , in this case by around 7 kcal / mol .",
    "b3lyp , on the other hand , finds about the same energy for both spin configurations .",
    "the more accurate approaches caspt2 and ccsd(t ) agree in yielding a sextet ground state , 16 kcal / mol below the quartet.@xcite a latter work by these authors shows the same low - spin bias in b3lyp for the iron ( iv ) porphyrin difluoride.@xcite it is worth noting here that even caspt2employed with the moderate active spaces currently affordable  has been found fallible in the estimation of these elusive spin states .",
    "inaccuracies have been reported in the prediction of the electronic ground states of the isolated iron porphyrin@xcite and of the oxyheme.@xcite    it is possible to find a rationale for the biases in dft and hf , considering the balance between the computed electronic exchange and correlation energies . in a simplified picture ,",
    "the ( negative ) exchange energy is contributed by like spin electron pairs , while electronic correlation arises from the interaction between electrons regardless of their spin . a method which includes",
    "the exchange and neglects the correlation , as hf does , will favor high multiplicities by maximizing the number of electrons with the same spin . to the contrary",
    ", experience shows that the combination of the exchange and the correlation terms in pure dft pushes the balance toward low spin configurations.@xcite attempts to improve the spin state energetics description of density - functionals have mostly been based on hybrid hartree - fock / dft schemes,@xcite which combine the exchange of hf with the exchange and correlation obtained from dft in proportions obeying empirical considerations .",
    "this approach , however , has given no universal functional capable to provide accurate splittings in every case .",
    "in general , those functionals offering a good description of the high spin species fail when tried out on low spin complexes , and vice versa.@xcite among them , b3lyp is seemingly the one with the best average performance up to now , yet exhibiting serious inaccuracies in the five coordinated models already discussed .    in the present study",
    ", we propose the dft+u approach as an alternative to the standard ab - initio techniques for a reliable description of the low lying states of iron heme complexes .",
    "the lda+u or gga+u method ( more generally denoted as dft+u ) was originally designed within the density - functional theory framework for the treatment of strongly correlated materials.@xcite@xmath0@xcite only very recently researchers have started to apply it to molecular , or mixed solid - molecular systems , with extremely promising results.@xcite@xmath0@xcite this approach corrects the tendency to overhybridize and delocalize electronic orbitals  ultimately originating in the presence of self - interactions in the exchange - correlation functionals  by introducing a term that penalizes fractional occupancies .",
    "we note in passing that in our present implementation we explore the possibility of a @xmath4 that is not a best - fit parameter , but an intrinsic , ab - initio linear - response property of the system chosen .",
    "however , this approach does not prove totally satisfactory , as in the case of low spin complexes it leads to values of @xmath4 lying 1 or 2 ev above the optimal ones .",
    "we show that with the inclusion of a single parameter , dft+u recovers the correct multiplicities of the five coordinated models where dft and hybrid methodologies are in disagreement with more elaborated techniques or experimental data .",
    "moreover , there is no impairment with respect to gga functionals in those cases for which dft displayed the right behavior .",
    "calculations of ligand exchange thermodynamics , spin transitions , and other properties , point to gga+u as an appealing tool to overcome the limitations entailed by the use of dft in the description of bioinorganic complexes , at a computational expense much lower than demanded by highly - correlated quantum chemistry methods .",
    "all calculations reported in this work have been performed with the public domain pwscf and cp codes included in the quantum - espresso distribution,@xcite based on density - functional theory , periodic - boundary conditions , plane - wave basis sets , and pseudopotentials to represent the ion - electron interactions .",
    "the pbe exchange - correlation functional@xcite has been used in combination with vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotentials,@xcite with the kohn - sham orbitals and charge density expanded in plane waves up to a kinetic energy cutoff of 25 and 200 ry respectively .",
    "the present implementation of dft+u stems from the early contributions by anisimov and others , @xcite@xmath0@xcite who proposed to correct the failures of the lda functional in dealing with the strongly localized d or f electrons of transition metal ions .",
    "an on - site correction was thus constructed to account for strong electronic correlations poorly described within the local - density or generalized - gradient approximations , and formulated as follows : @xmath5=e_{dft}[\\rho({\\bf r } ) ] +   e_{u}[\\{n^{i\\sigma}_{mm'}\\}]=e_{dft}[\\rho({\\bf r } ) ] + e_{hub}[\\{n^{i\\sigma}_{mm'}\\ } ] - e_{dc}[\\{n^{i\\sigma}\\}]\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the electronic density , @xmath7 are generalized atomic orbital occupations with spin @xmath8 associated to the @xmath9 atom , and @xmath10 is the sum of the occupations corresponding to all eigenstates , @xmath11 . @xmath12 $ ] is the standard lda or gga energy functional , and @xmath13 $ ] represents the `` correct '' on - site correlation energy . since @xmath12 $ ] already contains an approximate correlation contribution , a term intended to model such a contribution , @xmath14 $ ] , must be subtracted to avoid double counting .    in this work",
    ", we resort to the rotationally invariant formulation of dft+u introduced by liechtenstein @xmath2@xcite and later simplified by dudarev and his coworkers,@xcite in which the non sphericity of the electronic interactions and the differences among the interactions in like - spin and unlike - spin channels are neglected . with these assumptions , the correction to the energy functional",
    "can be written @xmath15=\\frac{u}{2 } \\sum_i \\sum_{m,\\sigma}[n^{i\\sigma}_{mm}- \\sum_{m'}n^{i\\sigma}_{mm'}n^{i\\sigma}_{m'm}]= \\frac{u}{2 } \\sum_{i,\\sigma } { \\bf tr } [ n^{i\\sigma } ( 1-n^{i\\sigma})]\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the hubbard parameter describing on - site correlations . in principle , different definitions for the occupation matrix are possible , which in turn will determine different values for @xmath4 . in this case",
    "we define @xmath16 with @xmath17 the weight of the electronic state @xmath18 , @xmath19 the valence atomic orbital @xmath20 of atom @xmath9 , and @xmath21 the one electron wavefunction corresponding to the state @xmath18 with spin @xmath8 .",
    "the diagonalization of the occupation matrices leads to the following expression for the energy correction : @xmath15=\\frac{u}{2 } \\sum_{i,\\sigma } \\sum_i \\lambda^{i\\sigma}_i ( 1-\\lambda^{i\\sigma}_i).\\ ] ] equation ( 4 ) clearly reflects the nature of the correction , which imposes a penalty ( mediated by @xmath4 ) for fractional occupations , thus favoring either fully occupied or empty orbitals ( @xmath221 and @xmath220 , respectively ) .",
    "we note that under this definition , @xmath4 corresponds to the difference @xmath23 as utilized by anisimov and other researchers.@xcite@xmath0@xcite for example , the adoption of @xmath4=4 ev in the present calculations is comparable to a @xmath4 of 5 ev in combination with a @xmath24 of 1 ev in the work of rollmann.@xcite whereas in recent applications @xmath4 is considered a fitting parameter,@xcite@xmath0@xcite here we obtain it from the spurious curvature of the dft energy as a function of the occupations .",
    "as shown by cococcioni and de gironcoli,@xcite the value of @xmath4 can be estimated as the difference between the screened and bare second derivative of the energy with respect to the occupations : @xmath25 in particular , we are interested in the self - consistent @xmath4 , which we will call @xmath26 , originating from the curvature of the dft+u ground state.@xcite to compute @xmath26 , a few linear response calculations must be performed at a finite @xmath27 , each one yielding a corresponding @xmath28 .",
    "it can be shown that there is a linear dependence between @xmath27 and @xmath28 , from which @xmath26 can be extrapolated:@xcite @xmath29 @xmath30 groups all electronic terms within the dft+u functional that have quadratic dependence on the occupations , whereas @xmath31 can be interpreted as an effective degeneracy of the orbitals whose population is perturbed .",
    "this procedure , which allowed us to attain an improved description of the multiplet splittings and bonding in fe dimers and feo related species,@xcite is the one adopted here to calculate a self - consistent @xmath4 parameter for the iron - porphyrin system . another criterion has also been explored , requesting that a linear response calculation at a finite @xmath4 returns this same value of @xmath4 at the output , e.g. @xmath32 .",
    "the parameter fulfilling this criterion will be hereafter denoted @xmath33 .",
    "this second criterion is not as appealing as the first one , since @xmath26 seems the `` right definition '' for self - consistency .",
    "in this section dft+u results are presented on four heme complexes : fe@xmath3p(im ) , fe@xmath34p(cl ) , fe@xmath3p(im)(o@xmath1 ) , and fe@xmath3p(co ) . in the first two cases , dft calculations fail to predict the high - spin nature of the system .",
    "the other two are examples of low - spin hemes whose electronic and geometrical properties are , in principle , correctly captured by standard density - functional simulations .",
    "these four case studies were chosen for their respective relevance in bioinorganic chemistry , and to illustrate the performance of the dft+u method on heme models exhibiting a variety of coordination modes and multiplicities .",
    "the fe@xmath3p(im ) system , depicted in fig .  [ fepim ] , has been the target of numerous computational studies , inasmuch as it appears as the natural model to represent the unbound active site of several heme proteins , in particular hemoglobin and myoglobin.@xcite@xmath0@xcite as mentioned above , the ground state of this compound has been experimentally characterized as a quintuplet ( s=2 ) , whereas dft calculations yield a triplet ground state ( s=1 ) . in table ii the energetic separations between the low lying spin states resulting from dft and dft+u are compared . according to pbe",
    ", the triplet is around 8 kcal / mol more stable than the quintuplet or the singlet ; similar gaps are obtained with the bp86 exchange - correlation functional.@xcite on the other hand , the transition energy between the triplet and the quintuplet is reduced to nearly 2 kcal / mol if b3lyp is used.@xcite as previously noted , the introduction of the hf exchange in the dft functional stabilizes high multiplicity states , but in this case b3lyp is still unable to provide the right splittings .",
    "the formalism summarized in equation ( 6 ) gives for this system a @xmath26 of 3.9 ev and a @xmath33 of 2.5 ev ( fig .",
    "[ uvuim ] ) .",
    "if any of these values are adopted , dft+u restores the experimental ordering of the spin states .",
    "the total energies of the low lying states as a function of @xmath4 are depicted in fig .",
    "the increase of the @xmath4 parameter equalizes the triplet and the quintuplet energies , producing a spin crossover at @xmath35 2 ev . at higher values of @xmath4 ,",
    "the quintuplet remains the ground state .",
    "[ symm ] highlights the effect of @xmath4 on the electronic symmetry of the d states in the heme porphyrin .",
    "spin occupations were computed by projecting the electronic wavefunctions on the atomic orbitals of the iron , as prescribed by equation ( 3 ) .",

    "[ symm ] represents the occupations of the minority spin manifold in the quintuplet state .",
    "iron(ii ) is a d@xmath36 ion and the quintuplet bears four unpaired electrons , therefore the sum of the occupations on the minority spin channel should be around 1 .",
    "it is not exactly 1 because the eigenstates of the complex do not correspond to pure d atomic orbitals , but are instead strongly hybridized .",
    "yet , it is possible to assign the electronic configuration of the system in terms of d atomic orbitals , depending on whether the occupations are close to 0 or 1 .",
    "note that by convention , the nitrogen atoms of the porphyrin ring are placed on the @xmath37 plane , with the @xmath38 and @xmath39 axes oriented along the fe - n bonds .",
    "pure dft ( @xmath4=0 ) , and dft+u with @xmath40 2 ev , converge to the ( d@xmath41)@xmath42 ( d@xmath43)@xmath42 ( d@xmath44)@xmath45 ( d@xmath46)@xmath42 state.@xcite this is the same configuration as reported by spiro and coworkers from b3lyp simulations.@xcite the increase of @xmath4 above 2 ev stabilizes the ( d@xmath41)@xmath42 ( d@xmath43)@xmath47 ( d@xmath44)@xmath47 ( d@xmath46)@xmath42 state , which is the one experimentally assigned to fe@xmath3p(im).@xcite interestingly enough , this change in configuration is associated with an inversion in the relative energy of the triplet and the quintuplet , which now becomes the ground state .",
    "the examination of the optimized geometry at a finite @xmath4 of 3.9 ev shows an agreement with the experimental data at least as good as pure dft does .",
    "the structural parameters most affected by the @xmath4 correction are those in the vicinity of the metal center , presented in table iii .",

    "the effect of the on - site correction can also be examined through the absolute magnetization of the molecule , defined as @xmath51 , a measure of the unpaired electron density in the system .",
    "[ absolute_mag ] illustrates how the on - site correlation affects the distribution of the unpaired electron density , reinforcing , in particular , the antiferromagnetic character of the o.s.s .",
    "the net effect of @xmath4 is seemingly to thwart the coupling of the unpaired electrons of the molecular oxygen and the porphyrin , stabilizing the separate species , which is reflected in the elongation of the fe - o distance discussed below .",
    "the absolute magnetization augments from 1.8 at @xmath4=0 to 3.2 at @xmath4=4 ev , a value placed halfway from that corresponding to the unbound system , comprised of a triplet plus a quintuplet ( s=1 + 2 ) .",
    "extrapolation to the @xmath39-axis in the @xmath52 plot ( fig .",
    "[ uvsuo2 ] ) yields a @xmath26 of 5.9 ev , sensibly higher than in the previous examples .",

    "it is important to emphasize that such values correspond to synthetic or natural compounds in which the o@xmath1 molecule is stabilized in the axial position by virtue of a second interaction on the distal side , namely an hydrogen bond or some kind of trapping or cage effect . in the absence of a distal cavity , oxygenation of iron ( ii ) porphyrins under ordinary conditions has been rarely observed.@xcite pure dft and b3lyp systematically overestimate the binding of o@xmath1 , giving for the free heme energies in the range of 15 - 25 kcal / mol,@xcite in direct contradiction with the experimental difficulty to isolate the oxygenated species . while part of this error is associated with the underestimation of the total energy of the quintuplet , such overbinding represents a major problem in the application of dft to the calculation of affinity constants . fig .",

    "<S> the possibility of obtaining the u parameter from first - principles is explored through a self - consistent linear - response formulation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this approach , which proved to be successful in other iron systems , produces in this case some overestimation with respect to the optimal values of u. </S>"
