    "time - of - use ( dtou ) tariffs are characterised by time - dependent electricity prices without a predetermined pattern .",
    "they are an important tool to elicit demand response from residential and small business loads .",
    "methods to quantify the impact of dtou price signals have to date focused on the demand baseline  @xcite ; the predicted demand in the hypothetical absence of a price signal .",
    "this paper proposes an elegant method for retrospective analysis of customer demand data that establishes a signal - to - noise metric for responsiveness to dtou tariffs .",
    "notably , the method is nonparametric and does not depend on demand baselines or behavioural models .",
    "the method is illustrated using one year  ( 2013 ) of half - hourly metered consumption data from the low carbon london ( lcl ) dtou trial  @xcite .",
    "after data cleansing a total of 4,756 smart metered households were available , of which 988 opted to receive the experimental dtou tariff .",
    "consider customers @xmath0 , whose electricity consumption has been recorded in the form of time series @xmath1 ( e.g. half - hourly consumption data ) .",
    "the customers have received a dynamic time - of - use price signal @xmath2 corresponding to the elements of the consumption time series .",
    "the electricity bill for customer @xmath3 is therefore @xmath4    we aim to quantify our confidence that the recorded consumption data @xmath5 has been influenced by the price signal @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 be a random permutation that shuffles days ( so as to maintain the structure of price events ) in the price signal and define a randomised electricity bill ( a random variable ) as @xmath8    we postulate that a customer @xmath3 who consumes electricity _ without regard _ for the price signal receives an actual bill @xmath9 that is in line with the distribution of randomised bills @xmath10 .",
    "if , on the other hand , a customer deliberately responds to tariff signals , the realised bill @xmath9 should be lower than most randomised bills .",
    "a responsiveness metric can thus be defined as the fraction @xmath11.\\ ] ] it is a measure of conformity between a household s energy consumption and the tariff signal , with high values ( @xmath12 ) indicating a likely deliberate response .",
    "@xmath13 may be considered a signal - to - noise measure for observed demand response .",
    "in fact , if @xmath10 is normally distributed then @xmath13 is monotonically related to the @xmath14-statistic @xmath15 by the one - to - one mapping @xmath16 .",
    "definition may be read as a signal to noise ratio , where the `` noise '' @xmath17 is the standard deviation of the random bill @xmath10 , and the `` signal '' the difference between its mean and the actual bill .",
    "although we will use @xmath13 in the following sections , the analysis may equivalently be performed using @xmath18 .",
    "the nonparametric quantile @xmath13 may be used for arbitrary distributions , whereas the @xmath14-statistic may be preferable to distinguish between highly - responsive customers if the normal approximation for @xmath10 is appropriate ( which is the case for the lcl trial data ) .    in practice , the distribution of the random bill @xmath19 and the values @xmath13 and @xmath18 are estimated by repeated random sampling of shuffled price signals ( 100,000 per household in our examples ) .",
    "1a illustrates the process for a single household .     and @xmath14 metrics for a single household .",
    "b ) distributions of @xmath20 for dtou and control groups ( 50 bins ) .",
    "c ) corrected dtou distribution @xmath21 and proposed mixture model of subpopulations .",
    "distributions were fitted to @xmath22 , with @xmath23 . ]",
    "a strong response ( high  @xmath13 or  @xmath18 ) can be attributed to :    * _ deliberate demand response _ : a conscious effort by the customer to respond to price signals or autonomous actions by appliances or an energy management system . *",
    "_ accidental demand response _ : coincidental alignment of consumption patterns with the price signal . * _ price signal bias _ , reflecting an overall dependence between the price signal and the population energy consumption .",
    "this may result from deliberate targeting of high load levels using high prices , or from accidental correlation between price signals and demand levels .",
    "for an individual customer it is not possible to disentangle these , but three aggregation methods described below can provide further insight .      in absence of an absolute benchmark the first approach is to consider customers _ relative _ signal to noise metrics , as captured by the confidence rank @xmath24 customers with a high rank index @xmath25 have outperformed most other customers in terms of their deviation from typical price - agnostic ( random ) behaviour .",
    "the confidence rank correlates strongly with observed demand response in the lcl trials : spearman s rank correlation with high price response was 0.78 and 0.43 for low price signals ( see @xcite for dr methodology ) .",
    "a second approach is to convert the responsiveness metric @xmath13 into a confidence level by comparison with a control group that represents the null hypothesis of non - responsiveness .",
    "the control group consists of customers who are assumed to resemble those in the response group , but did not receive the dynamic time - of - use signal .",
    "their @xmath26-values are computed identically .",
    "figure  [ fig : distributions]b shows the empirical @xmath26-distributions for lcl trial customers receiving the dtou signal and those on a regular tariff .",
    "for the dtou group , the data clearly evidences demand response , with a significant fraction of households ( the peak at @xmath27 ) outperforming all 100,000 randomised bills .",
    "accidental demand response alone would result in a uniform @xmath26 distribution , so the skewed control group distribution suggests a price signal bias towards increased bills ( small @xmath26 ) .",
    "this bias can be modelled as a coordinate transformation @xmath28 from the unbiased unit coordinate @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath30 be the ( empirical ) cumulative probability distribution of @xmath20 in the control group so that it represents the proportion of customers with @xmath31 .",
    "in order for the transformation @xmath32 to result in an unbiased corrected distribution , it must satisfy @xmath33 , which implies @xmath34 .",
    "the observed responses @xmath20 of the dtou group can thus be transformed to the bias - corrected responses @xmath21 using @xmath35.\\ ] ] intuitively , this can be understood as a fraction @xmath36 of the control group having a response less than or equal to @xmath13 .",
    "the bias - corrected @xmath29-distribution for the dtou group is shown in figure  [ fig : distributions]c . with the price signal bias accounted for , the value @xmath36",
    "may be used as a direct measure of the level of confidence that a household @xmath3 responded deliberately . of the 988 households in the dtou group ,",
    "41% responded deliberately at the 95% confidence level ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the third method considers responsiveness at a population level instead of assessing each customer individually .",
    "the bias - corrected @xmath29-distribution can be partitioned into a mixture of responsive and non - responsive subpopulations .",
    "the presence of a uniform background level @xmath38 is assumed to arise from the accidental demand response of the unresponsive population ; the rest of the population is considered responsive .",
    "figure  [ fig : distributions]c shows the fit of the proposed distribution @xmath39 to the corrected dtou distribution .",
    "the fitted parameter @xmath40 suggests that 62% of dtou customers were responsive , i.e. they demonstrated behaviour that was clearly distinguishable from the control group .",
    "note that this result does not depend on the choice of a confidence level .",
    "while it is impossible to state with certainty to which population any individual customer @xmath3 belongs , we may compute the probability of responsiveness conditional on its computed @xmath36 value : @xmath41",
    "we have introduced a novel nonparametric measure of customer responsiveness to dtou tariffs , which may be interpreted as a signal to noise metric for an individual customer s response  without requiring the use of baseline models .",
    "three increasingly sophisticated methods have been described to analyse these measurements to identify responsive customers .",
    "the resulting customer classification may be used to tailor information that is sent to customers , or to extrapolate trial results to populations with more or fewer responsive customers .",
