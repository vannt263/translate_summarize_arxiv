    "energy transfer to the reaction center ( rc ) core pigments of psii , in which the primary step of charge separation initializes an avalanche of photochemical reactions @xcite , reaches remarkable efficiencies of up to @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "however , it remains unclear of how such high efficiencies can be achieved in large and disordered systems .",
    "in contrast to the photosynthetic apparatus of green sulfur bacteria in which fast transfer is guaranteed by efficient energy funneling @xcite , microscopic derived hamiltonians do not predict a decisive energy gradient among the individual proteins of the c@xmath0s@xmath0m@xmath0 supercomplex @xcite .",
    "previous works describe the transfer kinetics with phenomenological models , and extract certain decay components such as the migration time ( average time that it takes for an excitation to reach the rc ) and trapping time by fitting to fluorescence decay lines @xcite .",
    "several rate limiting models are discussed in literature @xcite .",
    "recent studies favor the so called transfer - to - trap limited kinetic model @xcite in which the transfer rate from the antenna complexes of ps - ii to the rc is proposed to be the transfer limiting step .",
    "however , different kinetic models can be fitted equally well to measured fluorescence decay curves @xcite , and structure based models of energy transfer become necessary to shed light on the underlying transfer mechanisms .",
    "first microscopic simulations of the exciton dynamics in the c@xmath0s@xmath0m@xmath0 supercomplex show that the overall transfer is driven by a complex interplay of multiple rates rather than through a single transfer - limiting step @xcite .    in pigment - protein complexes",
    "directionality of energy transfer is driven by energy relaxation .",
    "variations in the energy bands of the individual proteins in c@xmath0s@xmath0m@xmath0 are not as distinct as in other photosynthetic systems . nevertheless , the energy gradient in c@xmath0s@xmath0m@xmath0 is not completely flat , and the pigments form a certain structure in the energetic layout .",
    "for example cp43 and cp47 are lower in energy than the lhcii antenna complexes @xcite . however , energy transfer in c@xmath0s@xmath0m@xmath0 is not a cascade of downhill steps toward the reaction center .",
    "actually the pigments in the proximity of the rc core are the energetically lowest ones @xcite .",
    "therefore , the last transfer step to the trap needs to overcome an energy barrier which supports the proposed transfer - to - trap limited exciton dynamics in c@xmath0s@xmath0m@xmath0 .",
    "the transfer limiting step to the rc core pigments , which is not anticipated in previous structure based simulations @xcite , becomes more evident once we include the recently derived hamiltonian of cp29 @xcite .",
    "the latter is substituted in ref .",
    "@xcite by a lhcii monomer .",
    "we show that the minor complex cp29 modifies the pathway of energy flow and yields a relaxation channel which drives energy from the peripherical antenna towards pigments closer to ps - ii .",
    "the transfer properties are sensitive to small structural modulations which is an immediate consequence induced by the flat energy gradient .",
    "there are two major mechanisms which change the energetic structure : ( i ) static disorder in which site energies are subjected to random fluctuations on much slower time scales than the exciton dynamics and ( ii ) the reorganization process in which vibrational coordinates relax to a new equilibrium position after a vertical franck - condon transition to the excited state energy potential surface @xcite . during this process",
    "the reorganization energy is dissipated in the protein environment .",
    "while the transfer times of an ensemble of individual disorder realizations are randomly distributed around some average value @xcite , the reorganization process is a systematic effect pertaining to the dynamics in all realizations in the same way .    due to the lack of the computational capability to carry out accurate calculations of the exciton dynamics , previous simulations of transfer time - scales in light - harvesting complexes ( lhcs )",
    "employ a combined modified redfield / generalized frster rate equation approach @xcite .",
    "however the combined modified redfield / generalized frster lacks the ability to simulate the reorganization process .",
    "in addition those models provide an _ ad _ _ hoc _ description of dynamic localization , and depend on an empirical cut - off parameter .",
    "recently , a non - markovian ( zofe ) quantum master equation description is employed to investigate robustness of transfer effiency and the importance of vibrational enhanced transfer in ps - ii @xcite .",
    "here , we perform accurate simulations based on the hierarchically coupled equations of motion approach ( heom ) @xcite which accurately incorporates the reorganization process and works for a wide parameter range for the coupling strength to the environment .    since the computational complexity of heom scales exponentially with increasing system size , novel algorithms based on optimized parallelization schemes have been developed @xcite .",

    "together with lhcii complexes , the c@xmath0s@xmath0m@xmath0 supercomplex aggregates as a large photosynthetic network in the grana membrane . for each c@xmath0s@xmath0m@xmath0 supercomplex",
    "there are about six additionally loosely bound lhcii trimers @xcite , which form a large antenna system with densely packed chlorophylls .",
    "energy is either absorbed in the pool of loosely bound lhcii trimers and then transfered to one of the peripherical lhciis of the c@xmath0s@xmath0m@xmath0 supercomplex or absorbed directly in the lhcii trimers of c@xmath0s@xmath0m@xmath0 .",
    "further , to some extend energy is absorbed in the minor complexes and ps - ii .",
    "we expect that the contribution of light absorption in the minor complexes and ps - ii to the photosynthetic yield is of less importance , since most of the photoactive area in the grana membrane is covered by the lhciis .",
    "thus , to reach a high photosynthetic yield fast and efficient transfer from the lhciis toward the rc core pigments of ps - ii becomes indispensable .    in the following",
    "we investigate average transfer times and the efficiency of energy transfer from the peripherical lhcii - m monomeric unit labeled as unit-1 in fig .",

    "we employ the presence of a certain amount of symmetry along x - axis and y - axis and reduce the system to a multi - protein network composed of lhcii - m , cp24 , cp29 , cp47 and the rc - core , comprising 93 pigments in total .",
    "first , we keep track of the population dynamics in absence of trapping and energy losses .",
    "we highlight of how energy spreads among the different protein complexes which , as we will analyze in detail , is driven by energy gradients in the pigments of the c@xmath0s@xmath0m@xmath0 supercomplex .",
    "further , we explore the influence of the reorganization process on the exciton dynamics .",
    "following , we investigate the deficiency of the approximate combined modified redfield / generalized frster method by comparing the population dynamics obtained from the combined method with the heom results .",
    "the combined modified redfield / generalized frster approach divides the exciton hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : hex ] ) into a strongly coupled part @xmath46 ( associated with strongly coupled domains ) and a weakly coupled part .",

    "we follow ref .",
    "@xcite and use a threshold of 15  @xmath20 .",
    "the intra domain dynamics is then modeled by modified redfield , while the inter - domain transfer is described by generalized frster theory . since the choice of initial conditions of the combined method is restricted to eigenstates of certain domains in @xmath46 we set the highest energy state of the domain which predominantly populates pigment chl@xmath18  606 of the lhcii - m unit-1 as initial condition . to allow for comparison",
    ", we use the same initial condition for the heom calculations .    figure  [ fig : plot_module_populations_average](a ) depicts the aggregated population at the individual protein complexes obtained within heom .",
    "convergence of the hierarchy depth is verified by comparing with a higher truncation level ( see appendix  [ convergheom ] ) .",
    "overall energy transfer and directionality is driven by energy relaxation along energy gradients within the c@xmath0s@xmath0m@xmath0 supercomplex .",
    "lhcii and the minor complexes ( modeled by lhcii monomers without chl  605 ) exhibit the highest energies while cp47 and the rc core pigments are lower in energy .",
    "the exciton , initially located at the unit-1 lhcii - m monomer , spreads over the complete lhcii - m trimer and populates the minor complexes .",
    "the fast initial spread , shows as maxima in the aggregated populations at lhcii - m units-2 and 3 .",
    "the highest population at the unit-3 is obtained after about 18  ps while the maximum population at unit-2 is reached a bit later at about 43  ps .",
    "the high population of the lhcii - m unit-2 indicates that energy transfer does not exclusively proceed along pathways corresponding to the shortest distance to ps - ii and the rc .",
    "the minor complexes are populated on a similar time - scale as the monomeric lhcii - m units . on a slower timescale cp47 and the rc core of ps - ii get populated , and finally after about 250  ps - 350  ps the system reaches steady state in which energy relaxation drives the population to the energetically low exciton states at cp47 . a schematic sketch summarizing the rough estimates for the energy transfer time - scales",
    "is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : plot_module_populations_average](d ) .",
    "the dynamics of the combined modified redfield / generalized frster approach ( fig .",
    "[ fig : plot_module_populations_average](b ) ) diverges from the heom results in several aspects .",
    "overall relaxation is overestimated by the combined modified redfield / generalized frster approach . especially transfer to lhcii - m unit-2",
    "is about seven times faster and already at 6  ps there is 0.29 population at the unit-2 .",
    "further , unit-2 gets populated ahead of unit-3",
    ". therefore the pathway of how energy spreads over the monomeric units of the lhcii - m trimer is reversed when compared to the heom calculation and thus the combined method does not predict reliable pathways of energy flow during the first picoseconds .",
    "however , the main difference is in the stationary population which is not only approached faster ( at about 150  ps - 250  ps ) but predicts a much higher aggregated population at cp47 and the rc .",
    "the combined modified redfield / generalized frster approach overestimates the efficiency of energy funneling towards the ps - ii .",
    "trapping time evaluated for various rate constant of primary charge separation @xmath23 at t=277  k. the transfer time is given as average over different initial conditions corresponding to eigenstates of the isolated lhcii - m unit-1 monomer .",
    "we investigate changes in the transfer time induced by structural changes in the hamiltonian .",
    "we compare three different scenarios , ( i ) @xmath48 for which we use the cp29 hamiltonian of renger @xmath9 @xmath10 ref .",
    "@xcite , ( ii ) @xmath49 for which the cp29 is substituted by a lhcii monomer ( without chl  605 ) and ( iii ) @xmath50 for which we add the reorganization energy to the site energies of lhcii - m and the minor complexes of @xmath49,scaledwidth=45.0% ]        to understand the discrepancy in the stationary population we need to investigate the energetic layout of the c@xmath0s@xmath0m@xmath0 supercomplex .",
    "the stationary state follows typically a thermal boltzmann distribution .",
    "however , the situation becomes more complicated in presence of the reorganization process in which the reorganization energy dissipates during the dynamics which modifies the energetic layout and affects the thermal population .",
    "the boxes in fig .",
    "[ fig : plot_module_populations_average](c ) indicate the extension of the exciton bands of the isolated proteins .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to the situation where the site energies comprise of the bare excitation energy plus the reorganization energy . due to the reorganization process",
    "the energetic structure changes during the dynamics and the energy of the proteins is lowered by the reorganization energy .",
    "especially the band of the monomeric lhcii - m units and the band of the minor complexes shifts to lower energies while the small reorganization energies at cp47 and rc induce only minor modifications . in total",
    "the already flat energy gradient gets even more flattened .",
    "this has a significant impact on the thermal population . without the reorganization process ( dashed lines )",
    "we expect a thermal population of about 0.75 at the pigments of ps - ii .",
    "taking into account the reorganization process ( solid line ) reduces the efficiency of energy funneling and only a population of 0.56 accumulates at ps - ii .",
    "our analysis is in consistency with the findings for the population dynamics and explains the strong deviations in the stationary state between heom and the combined modified redfield / generalized frster method .",
    "we note that for the combined modified redfield / generalized frster method the effect of reorganization energy on the thermal population can be corrected by subtracting the reorganization energy from the exciton hamiltonian prior to the dynamics .",
    "this is based on the assumption that the reorganization energy dissipates on an infinitely fast time - scale .      in the following",
    "we investigate how minor structural modifications in the c@xmath0s@xmath0m@xmath0 supercomplex influence transfer properties such as transfer efficiency and average transfer time . as we have discussed in detail in the previous section ,",
    "one mechanism that induces structural changes is the reorganization process . here",
    ", we continue the discussion and examine how much the reorganization process affects transfer efficiency .",
    "another aspect is the influence of the replacement of the minor complexes with lhcii monomeric units on the transfer properties .",
    "for instance the recently derived exciton hamiltonian of cp29 shows various differences from the exciton system of a lhcii monomer @xcite .",
    "we incorporate the primary step of charge separation by irreversible energy trapping as is described in section [ sec : excitonmodel ] .",
    "different values for the rate constant of primary charge separation @xmath23 have been predicted from fits to fluorescence decay lines , ranging from @xmath51=0.1  ps @xcite to @xmath51=0.64  ps @xcite .",
    "pump - probe spectra predict even larger time constants for the pheo reduction of about 3  ps @xcite .",
    "we do not explicitly take into account mechanisms of photoprotection and quenching and phenomenologically describe exciton losses by assuming an exciton lifetime of @xmath25  ns .    in the following we carry out heom simulations",
    "in which we include trapping and energy losses .",
    "to investigate the effects of the reorganization process on the energy transfer times , we slightly modify the hamiltonian of the c@xmath0s@xmath0m@xmath0 supercomplex in a benchmark calculation for which we artificially restore the original energy gradient across the pigment proteins by adding the reorganization energy of 220  @xmath20 to the site energies of lhcii and the minor complexes .",
    "we neglect the minor energetic changes induced by the reorganization process at the pigments of cp47 and the rc and denote the modified hamiltonian as @xmath50 .",
    "relaxation time scales in the population dynamics are hardly affected by the shifts in the site - energies , but the thermal state adjusts now according to the modified energy gradient . for @xmath50 we obtain a similar thermal state in the population dynamics with high population at the ps - ii pigments ( 0.81 ) as is predicted by the calculations with the combined modified redfield / generalized frster method .",
    "the small deviations largely result from the fact that we did not add additional reorganization energies to the site energies of cp47 and rc .",
    "the transfer time as function of trapping rate follows a linear trend for the considered parameter regime as is illustrated in fig .  [ fig : plot_averagetrapping ] .",
    "we assume that initially the exciton is located at the lhcii - m unit-1 , and we populate the initial density matrix according to eigenstates of the isolated lhcii monomeric unit .",
    "the shown results correspond to transfer times averaged over all 14 exciton states used as initial condition .",
    "transfer times ( efficiency ) for the c@xmath0s@xmath0m@xmath0 supercomplex ( marked by the red circles ) are in the range between 242  ps ( 88.0% ) and 302  ps ( 85.2% ) , depending on the trapping rate @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath50 exhibits a more efficient energy energy funneling towards the pigments at ps - ii and therefore transfer is faster by about 36  ps to 53  ps .",
    "previous calculations based on the combined modified redfield / generalized frster method predict transfer times of about 200  ps for transfer from peripherical domains to the chl  d1 in the rc @xcite .",
    "this is in good agreement with our results for @xmath50 which yields a transfer time of 211  ps for trapping rate of @xmath52  ps which is similar to the one used in ref .",

    "@xcite instead of the lhcii monomer replacement .",
    "we denote the new hamiltonian as @xmath48 , while the previous situation with the lhcii monomer substitution is referred to as @xmath49 .    for @xmath48 the pigments of cp29 form the lowest energy band in the energetic layout of the c@xmath0s@xmath0m@xmath0 supercomplex .",
    "this has a two - fold implication on the transfer process .",
    "firstly , the energy gradient between the outer lhcii antenna and the minor complex cp29 gives rise to an additional grade of directionality and supports fast transfer from the peripherical lhcii - m trimer to cp29 .",
    "the minor complex cp29 presumably acts as exit marker which guides energy from the outer antenna towards pigments closer to the reaction center .",
    "secondly , the pigments of cp29 and cp47 form a spatially extended region of low - energy states and hence energy accumulates at pigments in proximity to the rc , while the final transfer step to the rc core pigments is energetically uphill and therefore slow .",
    "overall the two effects result in a slightly slower energy transfer within the c@xmath0s@xmath0m@xmath0 supercomplex while including the cp29 hamiltonian , see fig .",
    "[ fig : plot_averagetrapping ] . for large trapping rates @xmath53  ps",

    "the spheres are uncolored if the population remains below 0.0079 .",
    "initially the highest eigenstate of the lhcii - m unit-1 is excited .",
    "both hamiltonians show a fast spread of the energy and at 12  ps the energy distributes across the whole lhcii - m timer . while @xmath49 distributes population equally among the minor complexes @xmath48 yields a more directed energy transfer towards the cp29 and cp47 . for longer times of 150",
    "ps energy accumulates at the low energy states at cp29 and cp47 for @xmath48 and thus forms a bottleneck for transfer to the rc .",
    "the bottleneck is less pronounced for @xmath49 .",
    "the rc pigments do not show significant population at any time since as soon as energy enters the rc there is fast transfer to chl  d1 and the fast time - scale of primary charge separation leads to the trapping of the population .    the rate limiting step in the transfer chain is the energetically up - hill transfer to the rc core .",
    "this is illustrated best in the aggregated population dynamics in presence of trapping in the reaction center , fig .",
    "[ fig : plot_module_populations_average_eff ] .",
    "we obtain a fast decay of population in the lhcii - m and after 100  ps more than 0.75 of the population has left the lhcii - m trimer . at the same time",
    "about 0.44 of population accumulates in cp29 and cp47 .",
    "after 300  ps still 0.2 of the population remains at cp29 and cp47 .",
    "with _ qmaster _ , a high - performance implementation of the heom method , accurate calculations of excitonic energy transfer in multi - protein photosynthetic functional units such as the c@xmath0s@xmath0m@xmath0 supercomplex become feasible .",
    "we investigate transfer times and transfer efficiency of energy conversion within the primary step of charge separation .",
    "the general concept behind energy transfer in c@xmath0s@xmath0m@xmath0 is given by energy relaxation .",
    "due to the flat energy gradient across the proteins , small structural changes such as the reorganization of the molecular coordinates within the excited potential energy surface , affect the energy transfer process .",
    "the impact of the reorganization process is rather significant and energy relaxation drives much less population to cp47 and the rc than expected from the site energies of the hamiltonian .",
    "the reorganization process induces a noticeable drop in the transfer efficiency of about 1.8% to 2.6% in absolute numbers for a 2  ps exciton lifetime , and thus can not be neglected in simulations of energy transfer in large multi - protein complexes .",

    "<S> the investigation of energy transfer properties in photosynthetic multi - protein networks gives insight into their underlying design principles . </S>",
    "<S> here , we discuss excitonic energy transfer mechanisms of the photosystem ii ( ps - ii ) c@xmath0s@xmath0m@xmath0 supercomplex , which is the largest isolated functional unit of the photosynthetic apparatus of higher plants . despite the lack of a decisive energy gradient in c@xmath0s@xmath0m@xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the energy transfer is directed by relaxation to low energy states . </S>",
    "<S> c@xmath0s@xmath0m@xmath0 is not organized to form pathways with strict energetic downhill transfer , which has direct consequences on the transfer efficiency , transfer pathways and transfer limiting steps . </S>",
    "<S> the exciton dynamics is sensitive to small structural changes , which , for instance , are induced by the reorganization of vibrational coordinates . in order to incorporate the reorganization process in our numerical simulations </S>",
    "<S> , we go beyond rate equations and use the hierarchically coupled equation of motion approach ( heom ) . </S>",
    "<S> while transfer from the peripherical antenna to the proteins in proximity to the reaction center occurs on a faster time scale , the final step of the energy transfer to the rc core is rather slow , and thus the limiting step in the transfer chain . </S>",
    "<S> our findings suggest that the structure of the ps - ii supercomplex guarantees photoprotection rather than optimized efficiency . </S>"
