    "magnetic reconnection is thought to be the mechanism underlying many explosive phenomena observed in both space and laboratory plasmas , ranging from magnetospheric substorms , to solar flares and coronal mass ejections , to the sawtooth crashes observed in tokamaks .",
    "the classic picture of reconnection involves current sheets , most often assumed to be planar - like and concentrated more narrowly in the third dimension .",
    "often , a guide magnetic field lies within the current sheet itself , so that the actual three - dimensional field does not vanish in the sheet .",
    "different models for reconnection occurring in such quasi-2d configurations have been developed , two prominent , different examples being the sweet - parker ( sp ) stationary reconnection scenario and the spontaneous reconnecting modes naturally developing due to the tearing instability of the current sheet itself .",
    "_ biskamp ( 1986 ) _",
    "@xcite first pointed out the important role played by the current sheet aspect - ratio in determining whether a stationary reconnection configuration could be reached .",
    "he found , via numerical simulations , that the sp current sheet could become unstable to reconnecting modes once a critical value of the lundquist number ( estimated on the current sheet length or breadth , @xmath0 ) of about @xmath4 was exceeded . a detailed examination of the stability of the sp configuration led to the definition of the plasmoid - chain instability @xcite , reminiscent of the plasmoid - induced reconnection concept and fractal reconnection models introduced by _ shibata et al .",

    "pucci and velli ( 2014 ) _",
    "@xcite have pointed out that the divergence of the growth rate of the plasmoid chain instability in the limit of large lundquist number within resistive mhd implies that current sheets should never elongate sufficiently to achieve the sp aspect ratio .",
    "they have shown that a critical aspect ratio separates slowly unstable current sheets ( with growth rate scaling as a negative , fractional exponent of the lundquist number ) from violently unstable ones ( growth rates scaling with a postive power of @xmath1 ) .",
    "they dubbed the instability of the critically unstable current sheet  ideal tearing \" ( hereafter it ) , because the growth rate , normalized to the alfvn time _ along the sheet _",
    "@xmath0 , becomes of order unity , and independent of the lundquist number itself .",
    "the large predicted growth rates and the presence of critical values for dimensionless numbers such as current - sheet aspect ratio make the described instabilities good candidates to understand and model the mechanisms behind observed fast reconnection phenomena @xcite . indeed , to date there is no agreed theoretical explanation for the fast time scales over which reconnection events develop in nature , nor for their triggering , while evidence from both experiments and numerical simulations points to the importance of small scale formation and kinetic effects , @xcite which are theoretically expected to lead to alfvnic ( or  ideal \" ) reconnection in 3d configurations as well @xcite .",
    "moreover , numerical simulations of tearing mode instabilities have identified a secondary , nonlinear , increase of the reconnection rate , that has been sometimes interpreted in terms of a nascent plasmoid - unstable sp regime @xcite or generically a secondary `` explosive reconnection '' regime @xcite .",
    "a nonlinear increase of the reconnection rate on ideal , alfvnic time - scales was also numerically measured by _",
    "et al . ( 2014 ) _",
    "@xcite in simulations of low mode - number reconnection instabilities .",
    "given the recent developments of the theory of large - aspect ratio current sheet instabilities , it is important to understand whether such augmented fast reconnection rates may indeed be interpreted as fast secondary instabilities of the nonlinearly generated current sheets stemming from the primary reconnection event .",
    "specifically , given that kinetic and two - fluid effects easily become dominant compared to classical , collisional resistivity at small spatial scales , it seems timely to see whether and how such effects modify the transition to an it regime .",
    "the present paper focuses on the extension of the it scaling arguments to weakly collisional regimes where reconnection is mediated by electron inertia effects , and on whether such generalized it regimes might explain the nonlinear occurrence of fast exponentially growing reconnection rates .",
    "we will consider both the incompressible reduced mhd ( rmhd @xmath5 see e.g. @xcite ) and electron mhd ( emhd @xcite ) frequency ranges , where the perturbations are dominated by alfvn and whistler modes respectively .",
    "the formal similarity between rmhd and emhd reconnection in slab geometry , previously discussed in @xcite , allows a unified treatment for the onset of it in an electron - inertia driven framework .",
    "electron inertia has long been considered the most promising alternative to standard resistive reconnection thanks to its greater weight with respect to resistivity in the generalized ohm s law of quasi - collisionless plasmas @xcite .",
    "astrophysical and thermonuclear fusion plasmas are examples of such systems , since their particle mean free path tipically exceeds the characteristic hydrodynamic lengths by order(s ) of magnitude . in general , interspecies collisions may be neglected with respect to inertial terms when the characteristic ion - electron collision frequency is negligible with respect to the inverse time scale of the phenomena considered @xcite . the inertial slab rmhd regime we focus on here has indeed been widely used to model basic features of magnetic reconnection in tokamak devices , for which the strong guide field approximation , of which we consider the 2d - geometry limit , was first devised , as well as for astrophysical applications . in emhd",
    "the neglect of collisional resistivity is even more justified , which is why emhd reconnection is mostly studied in purely inertia - driven regimes ( see @xcite for a discussion of the transition from resistive to inertial emhd ) .",
    "because of the large characteristic frequencies involved , emhd provides a natural framework for collisionless reconnection .",
    "the relation between the convection electron flow and the magnetic field , typical of the emhd regime , plays a prominent role in explaining the quadrupolar structure of the out - of - plane magnetic field @xcite , which is often recognized as a distinctive signature for the _ in situ _ detection of magnetospheric reconnection @xcite . _",
    "rogers et al .",
    "@xcite also adopted the incompressible , inertia - less , collisionless emhd model to explain the opening - up of the reconnection layer in 2d simulations with no guide field .",
    "we finally note that the present paper does not cover the framework of the so - called hall- or whistler- mediated reconnection ( appendix [ ohm_hall ] ) , especially relevant to the magnetopause environment @xcite , and which is known to provide prominent examples of fast reconnection rates weakly dependent from both resistivity @xcite and electron inertia @xcite .",
    "this will be considered in future works .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec.[ideal_tearing ]",
    "we summarize the re - scaling arguments leading to the concept of  ideal tearing \" . in sec.[model ] we introduce the model equations for reconnection in the rmhd and emhd regimes and the relevant dispersion relations ( sec.[linear ] ) . in sec.[results ] we extend the it paradigm first to the inertial rmhd and emhd reconnection regimes ( sec.[results_collisionless ] ) and then to include finite larmor radius ( flr ) effects ( sec.[results_flr ] ) .",
    "we then discuss these results ( sec.[discussion ] ) by comparing the role of inertia to that of resistivity in different natural and laboratory plasmas ( sec.[inertia ] ) , and by considering an application of the it model to collisionless steady reconnecting current sheets ( sec.[steady ] ) .",
    "then , in sec.[secondary ] we discuss how the re - scaling argument might explain explosive reconnection regimes nonlinearly observed in simulations of magnetic reconnection .",
    "sec.[summary ] provides a summary and conclusion and in the appendix [ app : model_equations ] we recall the derivation of the model equations both from a two - fluid model and compared with the generalized ohm s law ( sec.[ohm_hall ] ) .",
    "consider a current sheet of length @xmath0 and thickness @xmath6 .",
    "as mhd is scale - free , in the classical tearing mode theory it is customary to take the width @xmath6 as normalization length , since typically @xmath7 and @xmath6 is the only characteristic length defined by the ( usually 1d ) equilibrium profile .",
    "however , when dealing with thin sheets with @xmath6 arbitrarily small , the distinction between @xmath0 and @xmath6 becomes important , as the tearing mode growth rate is only small when measured with respect to the  ideal \" alfvn timescale based on @xmath6 , but can become large when measured with respect to a macroscopic scale @xmath8 ( the basic idea behind the plasmoid instability and it , detailed below ) .",
    "from now on , we will label quantities normalized to the scale @xmath0 with the apex `` @xmath9 '' , using standard notation for non - dimensional quantities defined in terms of the ( possibly microscopic ) shear - scale @xmath6 .    in this notation ,",
    "the classical linear reconnecting mode on harris - type current sheets has a maximal growth rate scaling as @xmath10 where the lundquist number @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the alfvn speed based on the characteristic magnetic field strength far from the sheet . in the sp case , predicated on the renormalized lundquist number @xmath14 ,",
    "one finds immediately that @xmath15 , i.e. a growth rate which diverges with the macroscopic lundquist number @xmath16 .",
    "_ pucci and velli ( 2014 ) _",
    "@xcite , aiming to resolve this paradox , incompatible with the ideal mhd limit , studied large - aspect ratio current sheets with @xmath17 scaling as a positive fractional power of the lundquist number @xmath18 .",
    "they showed that when a threshold @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is reached , the resistive tearing mode growth rate @xmath21 becomes of order unity and independent of @xmath16 .",
    "this regime was named `` ideal tearing '' , in contrast to the ct theory in which the growth rates scale as a negative power of the @xmath6 -normalized lundquist number @xmath1 .",
    "the large aspect ratio limit allowed @xcite to evaluate the characteristic ct reconnection rate through the fastest growing mode , from which the value @xmath22 was obtained , leading to the conclusion that sp current sheets should not form at large @xmath16 ( different equilibrium profiles may induce small deviations from this value @xcite ) .",
    "the renormalization in fact gives @xmath23 and the clock whose rate defines the reconnection speed enters this renormalized theory through @xmath24 which depends itself on @xmath0 , i.e. , the clock set on the ideal scale @xmath0 results slower by a factor @xmath25 ( or , as we shall see , @xmath26 in the emhd regime ) than the clock with which the reconnection rate is measured in the ct theory : it is thus always possible to find a critical exponent @xmath27 such that @xmath28 once the condition @xmath29 is imposed .",
    "in other words , the tearing - mode theory , under the assumption of a current sheet whose aspect ratio scales as a power of the ( small ) non - ideal parameter @xmath30 which allows reconnection , say @xmath31 , can explain the transition to fast reconnection if the value of @xmath32 is such that the growth rate of the instability is independent from @xmath30 itself .",
    "notice however that the it criterion may be applied in principle to any reconnection unstable aspect ratio @xmath17 , if @xmath0 is large enough with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "it is e.g. the case of tearing unstable current sheets , nonlinearly developed by primary reconnection events , which we will consider later .",

    "also @xcite for why flows may be neglected ) , this means that both in rmhd and emhd a collisionless sweet - parker - type current sheet is always unstable on ideal time scales .",
    "the rescaling argument at the basis of ideal tearing may thus provide a fairly general paradigm to describe explosive growth rate increases observed in the nonlinear stage of simulations of reconnection at @xmath17 not much larger than unity @xcite , when an @xmath207-point collapses into two @xmath208-points and the current sheet between the two becomes tearing unstable , eventually leading to the so - called plasmoid - chain instability . during this stage ,",
    "even before an ideal growth rate is achieved , a secondary growth rate may be measured , which is arbitrarily large ( possibly up to the inverse macroscopic time scale , in the ideal tearing limit ) .",
    "let be @xmath209 the length and @xmath210 the width of a secondary current - sheet between two @xmath208-points , generated in the nonlinear stage of the tearing of a current sheet with aspect ratio @xmath25 .",
    "focusing on the dynamics of this secondary current sheet , the ct growth rates would refer lengths to @xmath210 , whereas we now need to label with `` @xmath211 '' the quantities normalized to @xmath209 , since the latter plays the role of macroscopic length for the secondary dynamics ( cfr .",
    "sec.[ideal_tearing ] ) .",
    "even when we consider a primary tearing mode with @xmath212 , the secondary current sheet develops with a much smaller thickness ( corresponding to the singular layer thickness of the original tearing instability ) so that we can assume the most unstable tearing mode to be destabilized : accounting for flr effects , the re - normalized , most unstable , tearing mode growth rate on the secondary current sheet ( cfr .",

    "landi et al . ( 2015 ) _",
    "@xcite and discussed in depth in @xcite .",
    "let us now focus on a primary tearing mode of a small aspect ratio current sheet , assuming for simplicity @xmath217 . in this case",
    "the primary reconnection rate can not be estimated with that of the most unstable mode @xmath102 but the specific ld or sd regime in which the unstable wave - number falls must be taken in account , instead .",
    "let us now compare such primary reconnection rate to the secondary one , as estimated from eqs.([eq : secondary_flr]-[eq : secondary_s_visc ] ) .",
    "we immediately recognize that , even before the ideal tearing threshold is reached , the re - scaling argument predicts an increase in the growth rate , _ measured with respect to the primary mode macroscopic scale @xmath0 _ , by some positive power of @xmath218 times some positive power of @xmath219 .",
    "comparing eqs.([eq : secondary_flr]-[eq : secondary_s_visc ] ) we see that , for equal equilibrium profiles ( same @xmath220 ) , such an increase is relatively more important in the inertia driven - flr regime .",
    "to fix the ideas with a quantitative example , consider the rmhd - flr regime supposing the primary reconnection to develop on a current sheet described by the equilibrium used by _",
    "comisso et al . (",
    "@xcite , assuming an aspect ratio so close to unity that a single primary mode @xmath221 ( i.e. @xmath222 ) is excited in the sd , constant-@xmath42 regime , in the whole range of parameters in which @xmath3 and @xmath223 are varied ( @xmath224 ) .",
    "the primary tearing mode ( see e.g. eq.(27 ) of @xcite ) , once rescaled to @xmath0 , grows with @xmath225 , with some @xmath226 of order unity . for the secondary mode we may now use eq.([eq : secondary_flr ] ) .",
    "assuming for simplicity ( but with no loss of generality ) that the secondary current sheet resembles a harris - pinch profile to specify some value of @xmath227 ( here @xmath140 ) , the secondary growth rate , expressed again in terms of the scale @xmath0 , is given by eq.([eq : secondary_flr ] ) opportunely rescaled , @xmath228 .",
    "a dominant increase of the reconnection rate is therefore provided by the ratio @xmath229 . in particular ,",
    "in this example we obtain @xmath230 .",
    "of course , a more detailed analysis would be required to verify whether the re - scaling argument summarized by eqs.([eq : secondary_flr]-[eq : secondary_s_visc ] ) and the corresponding threshold conditions for the ideal tearing suffice to explain the explosive reconnection regimes observed in the above mentioned numerical studies .",
    "however , the qualitative considerations about the scalings provided in fig.(3 ) of @xcite and in fig.(2 ) of @xcite seem encouraging . because of the normalization assumed in these articles , the increase of the growth rates with decreasing plasma @xmath231 implies for the linear growth rate a scaling @xmath232 and for the nonlinear one a scaling @xmath233 at fixed @xmath153 , thus suggesting ( cfr .",
    "eq.([eq : flr_max ] ) and eq.([eq : secondary_flr ] ) for @xmath140 ) that an ideal tearing regime was observed in the nonlinear stage of the simulations discussed by _",
    "biancalani et al . ( 2012 )",
    "future studies will elucidate whether the explosive reconnection predicted by eq.([eq : secondary_flr ] ) and that studied in @xcite are effectively the same phenomenon .",
    "to conclude this section , we finally notice that , provided the ratio @xmath213 is large enough to destabilize a most unstable mode @xmath102 ( which is typical for secondary current sheets developed from the collapse of an @xmath207-point in the resistive regime @xcite ) the measured growth rate would be that of an exponentially growing instability , which in the resistive regime has the same scaling with @xmath1 as the sweet - parker reconnection rate ( i.e. @xmath234 ) .",
    "we have extended the analysis of @xcite to collisionless regimes , both in rmhd and emhd , by providing the scaling threshold values @xmath235 at which a current sheet with @xmath120 reconnects on the ideal macroscopic times of the model . for the harris - pinch equilibrium profile the exponents measured after numerical solution of the eigenvalue problem are @xmath236 and @xmath237 , in excellent agreement with the analytical estimations obtained by starting from the sd and ld dispersion relations . in rmhd , flr corrections typically reduce the width of the critical aspect ratio for the transition to `` ideal '' tearing . in the parameter range",
    "@xmath238 $ ] and for the harris - pinch case , such an aspect ratio becomes @xmath239 , instead of @xmath240 in the @xmath75 limit . since this implies a broadening of the critical reconnection current layer by a factor @xmath241 , when @xmath168 with @xmath170 , as it is usually the case , flr effects are expected to correspondingly lower the instability threshold .",
    "the collisionless it model has been applied to discuss the instability of steady collisionless reconnecting current sheets , which , just as in the resistive case , should not be observable as they become unstable to inertia - driven tearing modes on ideal time - scales .",
    "we notice however that the threshold current sheet to the it , found to be thinner in rmhd than in emhd ( eqs.([eq : a_vs_de ] ) ) , leaves the open question of how the alfvnic and whistler - dominated frequency regimes relate to the hall - mhd framework , which in principle encompasses both as two of its limits , opposite one to each other ( see appendix [ ohm_hall ] ) .",
    "we have also pointed out the relevance and importance of inertia - driven vs. resistive reconnection : the condition @xmath242 provides a stringent constraint on when resistivity may be neglected which is often overlooked , for example , when applying vlasov models of reconnection to tokamak plasmas .",
    "we have finally discussed how the rescaling argument at the basis of the it model may explain the `` explosive '' reconnection rate increase observed during the nonlinear stage of primary reconnection events , as secondary elongated current sheets are generated during the collapse of an @xmath207-point @xcite .",
    "the it regime may thus be in principle achieved also during secondary reconnection events involving the thin , elongated current layers nonlinearly generated by classical tearing processes @xcite or in kinetic turbulence @xcite .",
    "notice that large aspect ratio current - layers are generally expected to develop because of the `` exponentiation '' of neighboring magnetic field lines @xcite ) , and evidence of such exponential thinning of current sheets was recently provided , in the coronal heating context , by the numerical 3d simulations of @xcite .",
    "this model provides therefore a promising key to interpretate reconnection rates , which both in laboratory and astrophysics are observed to be orders of magnitude faster than what is predicted by the ct theory .",
    "the simplicity of the rescaling argument at the basis of the it model should not betray its non trivial reach .",
    "the dominant trend of recent research on magnetic reconnection , aiming at predicting almost ideal reconnection rates , focuses indeed on the role played by kinetic processes and secondary instabilities , whereas the model first considered by @xcite has the appealing feature of relying on simple and well known results .",
    "eqs.([eq : ohmrmhd]-[eq : emhd_u ] ) are derived with different approximations from the electron and ion momentum equations , which we write here below , again non - dimensionalized using @xmath6 and @xmath127 ( and the electric field normalized to a fraction @xmath243 of the reference magnetic field ) : @xmath244      here the kinetic pressure has been normalized to a reference value @xmath246 for the electron plasma pressure .",
    "this explains the weight @xmath247 in front of the ion pressure force in eq.([eq : ion ] ) , even though the ion thermal larmor radius is @xmath248 . as discussed in @xcite for the purely collisionless regime , eqs.([eq : ohmrmhd]-[eq : emhd_u ] ) may be indeed obtained , under appropriate approximations and closures for the pressure tensors ( and after re - normalization to @xmath249 for the emhd equations ) , from eqs.([eq : electron]-[eq : ion ] ) coupled with maxwell s equations using quasi - neutrality , @xmath250 .",
    "such an approach is essentially the one via which electron inertia effects were first included in reconnection models in the full mhd @xcite ) and rmhd frameworks @xcite . within this approach , inclusion of resistive diffusion @xmath194",
    "is straightforward , and the perpendicular ion - ion viscosity too can be retained in the form given in eq.([eq : rmhd_u ] ) if the hypothesis of a strong guide field is also assumed ( for a recent discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "derivation of the emhd equations follows simply from eqs.([eq : ohmemhd])-([eq : emhd_u ] ) , since ion dynamics is completely neglected @xcite .",
    "it can be verified that both eq.([eq : ohmrmhd ] ) and eq.([eq : ohmemhd ] ) represent the @xmath251-component of electron momentum equation ( eq.[eq : electron ] ) in the rmhd and emhd regime respectively , @xmath42 and @xmath252 expressing the @xmath251 component of the vector potential @xmath253 and of the electron current density @xmath254 .",
    "+ in rmhd , the @xmath255 contribution on the r.h.s .",
    "of eq.([eq : ohmrmhd ] ) expresses thermal effects related to electron compressibility along the magnetic field lines ( see e.g. @xcite ) : in the usual , strong guide field limit , @xmath36 is completely neglected since is ordered @xmath256 with @xmath257 , and to leading order ( @xmath258 ) both @xmath259 and @xmath260 are given by the incompressible @xmath261-drift velocity .",
    "as consequence , the stream function @xmath35 corresponds to the normalized electrostatic potential while the @xmath255 term appears in the electron momentum equation as a result of the diamagnetic corrections to @xmath259 in the lorentz force and the @xmath251 component of the gyrotropic electron pressure tensor @xcite .",
    "for this reason this term is considered to be an flr - type contribution .",
    "however , the cancellation between the diamagnetic drift contribution to the @xmath251-component of @xmath262 and the @xmath251-component of the gyrotropic pressure tensor is required in the derivation only if we do not order @xmath153 and @xmath3 with respect to @xmath263 ; in that case eqs.([eq : ohmrmhd]-[eq : rmhd_u ] ) contain terms up to the second order in @xmath263 . if instead we remember that in the slab , strong guide field , rmhd ordering , @xmath264 and that @xmath265 , then we may order @xmath266 .",
    "this is sufficient to re - obtain eqs.([eq : ohmrmhd]-[eq : rmhd_u ] ) even by assuming a scalar electron pressure tensor , if we disregard any contribution of order @xmath267 or higher , since from @xmath268 we would obtain @xmath269 $ ] ; our equations will now retain terms up to @xmath270 .",
    "+ in emhd , instead , the convection velocity field ( i.e. @xmath271 ) appearing in the second term of eq.([eq : ohmemhd ] ) is due to the magnetic field component @xmath36 , since the current density is carried by electrons only , which drive the dynamics through @xmath272 in the incompressible regime that we consider here . as a consequence , @xmath36 acts as a stream function for the in - plane electron dynamics , and resistivity , when included , enters also in the equivalent of the vorticity equation .",
    "for the same reason , the in - plane components of electron momentum equation , taken in the polytropic , incompressible limit , completely close the system of emhd equations : eq.([eq : emhd_u ] ) is the @xmath251-component of the rotational of eq.([eq : electron ] ) , and the field @xmath273 is proportional to the @xmath251-component of the electron generalized vorticity , defined by the curl of the electron fluid canonical momentum @xmath274 .",
    "the emhd equation for the electron generalized vorticity is mirrored in rmhd by the equation for the fluid vorticity alone ( eq.([eq : rmhd_u ] ) ) , of which @xmath275 represents the @xmath251-component ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this happens because in the alfvnic frequency range the plasma moves at the bulk velocity @xmath276 ) : eq.([eq : rmhd_u ] ) is therefore the curl of eq.([eq : ion ] ) , under the assumption of incompressibility , which allows expression of the perpendicular fluid velocity in terms of the stream function @xmath35 . if the plasma fluid is assumed to be incompressible but without imposing the strong guide field condition , this function can not be interpeted as the electrostatic potential . with no guide field",
    "however a separate analysis would be required to include @xmath255-type contributions .",
    "the delicate point about the applicability of eqs.([eq : ohmrmhd])-([eq : emhd_u ] ) lies indeed in the validity of the incompressibility assumption and in its relationship with the ordering of the parallel fluctuations of the magnetic field , which weighs the importance of hall s term in ohm s law , discussed below .      since reconnection models are usually discussed in relation to the non - ideal terms in ohm s law rather than in the framework of the full two - fluid equations for ions and electrons , it is worth to make here reference also to the generalized ohm s law , written with respect to the average plasma velocity @xmath41 .",
    "the standard text - book form obtained by combining eqs.([eq : electron])-([eq : ion ] ) ( see e.g. @xcite , p.91 ) while neglecting @xmath277 corrections , reads , after normalizing again lengths to @xmath6 and times to @xmath127 , @xmath278 @xmath279 here @xmath280 is the average plasma density and @xmath281 is the electron pressure tensor of eq.([eq : electron ] ) , measured in the electron rest frame .",
    "the ion pressure tensor contribution is neglected since it is @xmath277 smaller when the temperatures of the two species are comparable .",
    "note that it has been recently shown by _",
    "kimura et al . ( 2014 ) _",
    "@xcite that the ( often neglected ) term @xmath282 is necessary to respect energy conservation of the 1-fluid system in the collisionless limit ( @xmath174 ) .",
    "the generalized ohm s law is essentially the rewriting of the electron momentum equation with respect to @xmath41 and @xmath254 , that replace @xmath259 .",
    "we then recognize the essential difference between the dynamics of the bulk plasma and of the magnetic induction , and the role that the hall - term @xmath283 has in this : while the plasma always moves at the fluid velocity of ions , the magnetic induction evolves ( with the rotational of eq.([eq : ohm ] ) ) as dragged by the fluid velocity of the electrons , @xmath284 .",
    "in particular , the term @xmath285 describes the convection of magnetic field lines by the electron fluid in the collisionless limit neglecting electron inertia . as well known @xcite ,",
    "the rmhd and emhd sets of equations for slab reconnection without electron temperature effects may be therefore seen as two extreme limits with respect to the hall term ( @xmath73-term ) , in ohm s law : the rmhd regime described by eqs.([eq : ohmrmhd]-[eq : rmhd_u ] ) at @xmath75 corresponds to neglecting hall s term entirely , whereas the emhd framework is recovered when the fluid dynamics is restricted to electrons only ( @xmath286 ) , that is at scales @xmath287 and @xmath288 , so that eq.([eq : ohm ] ) becomes the only relevant equation for our fluid system .",
    "it is however interesting to remark that in the strong guide field ordering , both ions and electrons in - plane velocities are equal at the leading order in @xmath263 to the @xmath261-drift . by direct comparison of the @xmath251-component of @xmath289 with @xmath290 $ ] ( cfr .",
    "previous section ) , is immediate to recognize that the hall term survives in the ordering with @xmath291 through the diamagnetic - drift contribution to @xmath292 , @xmath293=d_i({\\bm j}\\times { \\bm b})\\cdot{\\bm e}_z / n$ ] .",
    "this expresses the balance between kinetic and magnetic pressure forces not only at equilibrium but also for the perturbations .",
    "we conclude by recalling that , when hall s term is retained while still considering the bulk plasma response to field evolution ( i.e. ion momentum equation is not neglected , so that @xmath294 ) , an intermediate regime is entered , which is sometimes called `` hall - mediated reconnection '' ( hmr ) or even `` whistler mediated reconnection)-([eq : emhd_u ] ) , though there has been some ambiguous notation for different regimes in the past .",
    "also note that , in some works , what we here name ( resistive ) hmr was even refered to as the `` collisionless reconnection '' regime ( see e.g. @xcite ) , due to the weak dependence from @xmath1 found in the hall - dominated reconnection rate ( see e.g. @xcite ) . ] '' @xcite .",
    "these regimes are not of concern in this paper , since they can not be recovered in the framework of two - field models .",
    "the decoupling of ion and electron motions at the ion inertial scale ( i.e. for @xmath295 ) requires more than two scalar fields to be retained to account for two - fluid effects ( also notice that eqs.([eq : ohmrmhd])-([eq : emhd_u ] ) do not contain @xmath73 as a characteristic scale length ) . as discussed by _",

    "et al . ( 2009 ) _",
    "@xcite , hall term effects are retained by relating the magnitude of @xmath36 , as generated by hall s term in eq.([eq : ohm ] ) , to the compressible component of @xmath296 , absent in our incompressible model . by helmholtz decomposition , this should enter through an irrotational contribution , @xmath297 , related to the scalar field @xmath298 ; in turn , the components @xmath299 and @xmath300 should also be retained .",
    "this immediately highlights the most delicate point concerning the @xmath283 term in ohm s law , already pointed out at the end of the previous section : due to the direct relation between @xmath36 and @xmath298 , the ( in)compressibility assumption plays a major role in determining the extent of hall physics retained in the model .",
    "remarkably , if @xmath301 , the in - plane incompressibility @xmath302 is admitted both in the @xmath261-drift regime of the low-@xmath231 limit , where @xmath36 is neglected with respect to the strong guide field , and in the high-@xmath231 limit , where the large kinetic ( electron ) pressure implies the smallness of both @xmath303 and @xmath304 .    the authors are grateful to francesco pegoraro for discussions and comments .",
