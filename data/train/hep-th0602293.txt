    "<S> we review the issue of chronology protection and show how string theory can solve it in the half bps sector of ads / cft . according to the llm prescription , half bps excitations of ads@xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 geometries in type iib string theory </S>",
    "<S> can be mapped into free fermion configurations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that unitarity of the theory describing these fermions is intimately related to the protection of the chronology in the dual geometries .    </S>",
    "<S> the principle of causality stands at the foundation of all our understanding of physics . </S>",
    "<S> it can not be relaxed without falling into paradoxes which , in the final analysis , consist either in the attempt to change the past conditions at the origin of the event or in the so - called bootstrap paradox , occurring when the effect is the cause of its own existence . </S>",
    "<S> the concept of causality is so important that it has been hardcoded into newtonian physics and special relativity . </S>",
    "<S> but as soon one takes into account the gravitational force , space and time become dynamical . </S>",
    "<S> their evolution is driven by local equations and the equivalence principle ensures that the causality requirements of special relativity are locally respected . </S>",
    "<S> however , the gravitational field equations do not put any global constraint on the topology of time , leaving the possibility for the existence of closed timelike curves ( ctcs ) , seeds of the violation of causality . </S>",
    "<S> the global nature of ctcs is what makes them so elusive and difficult to treat .    </S>",
    "<S> essentially , ctcs can arise by two mechanisms , rotation ( or dragging of the inertial frames ) and effectively superluminal propagation . </S>",
    "<S> the most well - known example of non topologically trivial ctcs induced by rotation is given by the gdel universe @xcite , a homogeneous and simply connected manifold described by the metric @xmath3 here , @xmath4 is a periodic angular coordinate , whose orbits become timelike for large @xmath5 due to the frame - dragging term in the metric and form therefore ctcs . the fact that these ctcs exist at all times is a reason one can invoke to discard this solution . </S>",
    "<S> another example is the kerr black hole that has harmless ctcs induced by its rotation , but they are hidden by the cauchy horizon , which is unstable . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is worse in higher dimensions , where naked ctcs are a generic feature of kerr black holes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that supersymmetry does not help to rule out chronological pathologies @xcite , nor does the lifting to higher dimensional supergravities @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the other mechanism to create ctcs is to construct geometries allowing for effectively superluminal propagation of signals . </S>",
    "<S> for example , gott s time machine @xcite consists in two parallel cosmic strings in relative motion . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the cosmic strings on the spacetime is to create conical defects , which can be cleverly exploited to build ctcs using the properties of lorentz transformations ( see figure  [ fig - gott ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> again , this solution has problems , for example its spacelike total energy momentum , which make it unphysical @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> however , ori has recently been able to show the existence of a family of solutions representing time machines with a compact vacuum core @xcite , in which ctcs are created in a compact region evolved from a causally well - behaved past . </S>",
    "<S> these solutions satisfy all energy conditions , are regular , asymptotically flat and topologically trivial , proving that general relativity alone can not prevent the formation of ctcs .    in 1992 , hawking proposed the chronology protection conjecture @xcite , which states that the laws of physics do not allow the appearance of ctcs . in particular , he argued that the strong backreaction due to quantum fluctuations should destroy the chronology horizon . </S>",
    "<S> however , in 1996 , kay , radzikowski and wald showed that there are points on the chronology horizon where the semiclassical einstein s equations fail to hold @xcite , and therefore the ultimate resolution of the chronology protection issue must involve the full theory of quantum gravity ( see matt visser s review @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> string theory is believed to yield a consistent theory of quantum gravity , therefore we shall take a more fundamental point of view , and consider the ( super-)gravity theories merely as its effective low energy limits . then , even if the effective theory can not distinguish between causally well - behaved and ill spacetimes , one can hope that string theory provides a mechanism to rule out the pathological solutions or eliminate the ctcs .    to be more specific </S>",
    "<S> , we will concentrate on the half bps sector of ads / cft @xcite , where we have a strong control on the physics . </S>",
    "<S> using the ads / cft correspondence , we have a non - perturbative formulation of type iib superstring theory in terms of @xmath6 sym in four dimensions @xcite . in the half bps subsector </S>",
    "<S> , the sym theory reduces to a gauged quantum mechanical system of @xmath7 harmonic oscillators , with the harmonic potential generated by the conformal coupling to the @xmath8 background . </S>",
    "<S> half of these oscillators consist in left - moving excitations , the other half in right - moving ones . </S>",
    "<S> the bps condition translates then in having just left - moving excitations on - shell . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the model is gauged , and only gauge - invariant states are physical . </S>",
    "<S> one can use the available gauge invariance to diagonalize the matrix of left - movers , thus leaving only @xmath9 physical degrees of freedom . performing carefully this change of variables , </S>",
    "<S> one introduces a jacobian in the path integral , and effectively changes the statistics of the degrees of freedom which become fermionic .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> the half bps sector is described by a system of @xmath9 free fermions in a harmonic well . </S>",
    "<S> its ground state corresponds to the @xmath9 fermions distibuted on the @xmath9 lowest energy levels of the harmonic oscillator , while the excitations correspond to excited fermions with energy higher than the fermi energy , or holes inside the fermi sea . using the ads / cft correspondence </S>",
    "<S> , one can check that the former correspond to giant gravitons growing on the @xmath10 factor of the metric , and the latter to giant gravitons growing on the ads@xmath0 factor @xcite ( see figure  [ fig - harmonic ] ) .     </S>",
    "<S> +    to obtain the ( semi-)classical configurations of the system , we trade the energy eigenstate basis for coherent states . then , each fermion occupies an area @xmath11 in the phase space of the harmonic oscillator , and the classical configurations are given by quantum hall droplets in this space , i.e.  by the description of a region of area @xmath12 where the fermions are localized . </S>",
    "<S> , with @xmath13 the planck length , and the radius @xmath14 of ads@xmath0 is related to them by @xmath15 . ] the ground state of the system corresponds to a disk centered in the origin , of area @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> small deformation of the surface of the disk correspond to closed string excitations , or perturbative gravitons , propagating in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> finally , small holes in the disk correspond to stacks of @xmath10 giant gravitons and droplets of fermions high above the fermi sea to ads@xmath0 giant gravitons ( see figure  [ fig - phasespace ] ) .     and holes in the fermi sea to giant gravitons in @xmath10 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> thanks to the work by lin , lunin and maldacena @xcite , we have the complete supergravity solution dual to these classical cft states . </S>",
    "<S> they define a function @xmath17 which takes the value @xmath18 inside the hall droplets , and @xmath19 outside . </S>",
    "<S> the gravitational dual to this configuration is then given by the metric @xmath20 with @xmath21 the function @xmath22 and the shift vector @xmath23 are determined by fermion configurations @xmath24 , which act as boundary value , @xmath25 ^ 2}\\,,\\ ] ] @xmath26 ^ 2}\\,.\\ ] ] we have therefore a very nice realization of holography , in which the dual field theory data is mapped on the @xmath27 two - plane of the gravity solution .    </S>",
    "<S> it is useful to describe the fermi liquid using the variable @xmath28 , which takes the value one inside the hall droplets , and zero outside . </S>",
    "<S> then , it is tempting to go beyond the classical limit , and interpret the function @xmath29 as the probability density of the fermions . from the point of view of the sym theory , as long as @xmath30 $ ] , one has a well - defined semi - classical state of the field theory yielding this probability density . due to the noncommutativity of the phase space variables , the variation of @xmath31 must be slow on the scale of @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath33 would correspond to a violation of pauli s exclusion principle , while negative density clearly has no meaning . </S>",
    "<S> however , on the gravitional side of the correspondence , _ any _ real function @xmath29 gives a one half bps solution of the supergravity equations of motion , in general with some singularities . </S>",
    "<S> as observed in @xcite , whenever the above physical conditions on @xmath29 are violated , the dual spacetime has closed timelike curves . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that _ the requirement of unitarity of the dual cft implements the chronology protection for superstring theory on asymptotically ads@xmath34spacetimes_.    for simplicity , we shall illustrate this behaviour in the case of the superstar solution , which is the simplest family of half bps solutions of type iib supergravity on ads@xmath34 , given by the metric @xmath35 with @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath39 factor of the metric in these coordinates is given by @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> this solution is obtained by oxidation to ten dimensions @xcite of the extremal limit of the black hole solution with one r - charge of the @xmath41 model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> again , there is a five - form field strength turned on , which can be found in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath42 we recover standard ads@xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath43 case exhibits a naked singularity at the origin @xmath44 of ads , where a condensate of giant gravitons growing in the five - sphere sits , and acts as a source for the supergravity fields @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this view has been confirmed in @xcite , where the corresponding fermion distribution in the dual cft was interpreted as a dilute gas of holes in the fermi sea . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , using the coordinate transformation @xmath45 one recovers the llm metric ( [ llm ] ) with polar coordinates @xmath46 on the @xmath47 plane . with some algebra , one </S>",
    "<S> can then compute the corresponding function @xmath48 , that reads @xmath49\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> its @xmath27 limit yields the fermion distribution @xmath51 llm showed that the vacuum ads@xmath34 is represented by a fermi droplet of density @xmath52 and radius @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> its total area @xmath54 consists therefore exactly of @xmath9 fermi cells of area @xmath55 . by turning on the r - charge @xmath56 </S>",
    "<S> , the probability density spreads to a disk of radius @xmath57 , but with lower density , in such a way that the correct number of fermions @xmath58 is recovered . </S>",
    "<S> this fact supports the interpretation of @xmath29 as a density distribution of fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the fermion system represents a uniform gas of holes delocalized in the fermi sea , and since such holes correspond to giant gravitons growing on the five - sphere @xcite , the superstar can be thought of as the backreaction on spacetime produced by a condensate of giant gravitons @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us suppose now that @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> corresponds to putting sources away from the @xmath60-plane , and is therefore not covered by the llm construction . ] </S>",
    "<S> the metric ( [ superstar ] ) still represents a genuine solution of the supergravity theory . </S>",
    "<S> this spacetime is defined for @xmath61 , and has a naked singularity at @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath63 it is perfectly well - behaved , but one checks that in - between , for @xmath64 , the coefficient @xmath65 of the metric becomes negative , and the orbits of @xmath66 are ctcs ( see figure  [ fig - superstar ] ) .    . ]    </S>",
    "<S> note that the metric remains lorentzian everywhere . as in the superstar case </S>",
    "<S> , we can cast the metric in the llm form to read off the source which produces this spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> the result is again ( [ superstar - density ] ) , but this time , since @xmath67 , the fermi sea has been squeezed to a smaller radius , resulting in a density @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies the presence of more than one fermion per fermi cell , in plain violation of pauli s exclusion principle . </S>",
    "<S> the anti - superstar has no dual cft state . </S>",
    "<S> taking the dual cft description equivalent to type iib superstring theory as the fundamental one , we see that the pauli exclusion principle automatically rules out the solutions of the form ( [ superstar ] ) with causal anomalies .    </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism works in fact in much more generality , and the chronology protection conjecture has been proven for general fermionic distributions with circular symmetry . using continuity arguments , it was shown in @xcite that supergravity solutions resulting from non - physical distributions @xmath29 ( i.e. which do not define a good probability density ) have indeed ctcs . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , milanesi and oloughlin proved the converse by a detailed analysis of the geometries , i.e. that solutions generated by well - behaved fermion densities are free of ctcs @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> to summarize , in the half bps sector a spacetime suffers from ctcs if and only if the boundary condition @xmath68 for the supergravity solution violates somewhere the bound @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> if we interpret @xmath29 as the probability density of fermions in the phase space , this bound corresponds to a unitarity bound of the dual field theory ; @xmath33 would violate pauli s exclusion principle , while negative @xmath29 would imply negative norm states . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , configurations violating this bound do not correspond to any state in the hilbert space of the sym theory , which gives a fundamental description of superstring theory on ads@xmath34 , and the corresponding causality - violating backgrounds are forbidden . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism implements in a simple form the chronology protection conjecture for a subsector of type iib superstring theory in asymptotic ads@xmath34 backgrounds , and suggests a deep link between causality in gravitational theories and unitarity of the dual field theory .    </S>",
    "<S> such a link also emerged in the analysis of the bmpv black hole @xcite , for which a similar protection mechanism acts . </S>",
    "<S> this black hole has ctcs , which are hidden by the event horizon in the underrotating regime , but develops naked ctcs if one increases the angular momentum and enters the overrotating regime . using the microscopic description in terms of a two - dimensional conformal field theory , provided by string theory </S>",
    "<S> , herdeiro showed that the causality bound corresponds to a unitarity bound in the cft @xcite , and therefore that the overrotating spacetimes are not genuine solutions of string theory . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis has then been generalized by boni and silva , who extended the protection mechanism to general ads@xmath70 bubbling solutions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this mechanism could apply to non - supersymmetric configurations , and it was proposed in @xcite to hold for non - extremal kerr - ads@xmath0 black holes of type iib supergravity . </S>",
    "<S> such solutions have naked ctcs for equal angular momenta and sufficiently negative mass . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> unitary representations of the superconformal algebra put a lower bound on the mass . </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to check if the bounds agree in this non - supersymmetric case .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , it would be interesting to understand how this chronology protection mechanism can be realized in other sectors of ads / cft . </S>"
