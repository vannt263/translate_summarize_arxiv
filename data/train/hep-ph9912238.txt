    "within the standard model ( sm ) , the @xmath1 nature of the weak interaction dictates a zero mass for all three families of neutrinos .",
    "the discovery of neutrino mass(es ) or oscillation(s ) will certainly push for new physics .",
    "evidence for neutrino oscillations has been collected in a number of solar neutrino and atmospheric neutrino experiments .",
    "the most impressive results were the recent @xmath2 neutrino deficit and the asymmetric zenith - angle distribution observed by the super - kamiokande collaboration @xcite .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino deficit and zenith - angle distribution can be explained by the @xmath3 or @xmath4 oscillations ( @xmath5 is a sterile neutrino that has negligible coupling to @xmath6 or @xmath7 boson and the former has a slightly better fit ) . the oscillation parameters with @xmath8 at 90% c.l .",
    "are @xcite @xmath9 on the other hand , the solar neutrino deficit admits more than one solution . with @xmath10 the solutions at 95% c.l .",
    "are @xcite @xmath11 the above two neutrino - mass differences can be accommodated by the three species of neutrinos that we know from the sm .",
    "there is also another indication for neutrino oscillation from the accelerator experiment at the liquid scintillation neutrino detector ( lsnd ) @xcite , which requires an oscillation of @xmath2 into another neutrino with @xmath12 to as well accommodate this data it requires an additional species of neutrino beyond the usual neutrinos .",
    "nevertheless , further evidence from the next round of neutrino experiments is required to confirm the neutrino mass and oscillation . as neutrino is favored to be massive it is desirable to understand the generation of neutrino masses from physics beyond the sm , especially , to see if the new physics can give a neutrino mass pattern that can explain the atmospheric and solar neutrino data , and perhaps the lsnd as well .    an economical way to generate small neutrino masses with a phenomenologically favorable texture is given by the zee model @xcite , which generates masses via one - loop diagrams .",
    "the model consists of a charged gauge singlet scalar @xmath13 , the zee scalar , which couples to lepton doublets @xmath14 via the interaction @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the su(2 ) indices , @xmath17 are the generation indices , @xmath18 is the charge - conjugation matrix , and @xmath19 are yukawa couplings antisymmetric in @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "another ingredient of the zee model is an extra higgs doublet ( in addition to the one that gives masses to charged leptons ) that develops a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) and thus provides mass mixing between the charged higgs boson and the zee scalar boson .",
    "the corresponding coupling , together with the @xmath19 s , enforces lepton number violation .",
    "the one - loop mechanism for the zee model can be found in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "a recent analysis by frampton and glashow @xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) showed that the zee mass matrix of the following texture @xmath22 where @xmath23 is small compared with @xmath24 and @xmath25 , is able to provide a compatible mass pattern that explains the atmospheric and solar neutrino data .",
    "the generic zee model guarantees the vanishing of the diagonal elements , while the suppression of the @xmath26 entry , here denoted by the small parameter @xmath23 , has to be otherwise enforced .",
    "moreover , @xmath27 is required to give the maximal mixing solution for the atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "we shall describe the features in more detail in the next section .",
    "so far the zee model is not embedded into any grand unified theories or supersymmetric models . here",
    "we analyze the embedding of the zee model into the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with minimal extensions , namely , the @xmath0-parity violation .",
    "the right - handed sleptons in susy have the right quantum number to play the role of the charged zee scalar . the @xmath0-parity - violating @xmath28-type couplings ( @xmath29 )",
    "could provide the terms in eq.([zcp ] ) .",
    "it is also easy to see that the @xmath0-parity - violating bilinear @xmath30-type couplings ( @xmath31 ) would allow the second higgs doublet @xmath32 in susy to be the second ingredient of the zee model .",
    "so far so good .",
    "however , the susy framework dictates extra contributions to neutrino masses , which deviate from the texture of the zee mass matrix of eq .",
    "( [ zee - m ] ) .",
    "the major objective of this paper is to address the feasibility of the embedding and to determine under what conditions could one make a supersymmetric zee model within the @xmath0-parity - violating susy framework while retaining the successful flavor of the former .",
    "we will also discuss briefly more generic versions of supersymmetric zee model .",
    "there is also a study of zee mass matrix within the framework of gauge - mediated susy breaking with the messenger field as the zee singlet @xcite .    in @xmath0-parity - violating susy , there are three other sources for neutrino masses , in addition to the zee model contribution .",
    "they are ( i ) the tree - level mixing with the higgsinos and gauginos , ( ii ) the one - loop diagram that involves the usual mass mixing between the left - handed and right - handed sleptons proportional to @xmath33 , and ( iii ) the one - loop diagram that again involves the mixing between the left - handed and right - handed sleptons but this time via the @xmath28 and @xmath34 couplings .- parity violation .",
    "this was discussed in ref .",
    "this contribution depends on the @xmath0-parity violating @xmath35 terms and basically enters in the same entries in the neutrino mass matrix as the corresponding @xmath34 terms , and thus supplementing the latter .",
    "we will neglect this type of contribution in this paper . ]",
    "the first two contributions have been considered extensively in literature @xcite , but the last one is identified here for the first time . also , we are the first one to identify the zee model contribution to the neutrino mass in the susy framework .",
    "furthermore , we will obtain the conditions for the zee model contribution to dominate over the contributions in ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "the contribution in ( iii ) can actually preserve the texture of the mass matrix of eq .",
    "( [ zee - m ] ) .",
    "there are complications in choosing a flavor basis when @xmath0 parity is broken .",
    "actually , the form and structure of the lepton mass matrices under the coexistence of bilinear and trilinear @xmath0-parity - violating couplings are basis dependent .",
    "one has to be particularly careful with a consistent choice of flavor basis . here",
    "we adopt the single - vev parametrization @xcite that provides an efficient framework for our study . the most important point to note here",
    "is that this parametrization implies a choice of flavor basis under which all three sneutrinos have no vev , without any input assumptions .",
    "all @xmath0-parity - violating couplings introduced below are to be interpreted under this basis choice .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    ", we describe the texture of the zee mass matrix in eq .",
    "( [ zee - m ] ) . in sec .",
    "iii , we calculate entries in the @xmath36 neutrino mass matrix from all the sources listed above . in sec .",
    "iv , we derive the conditions for the contributions from the zee model and from ( iii ) above to be dominant .",
    "section v is devoted to discussions on more general versions of supersymmetrization of the zee model .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "here we briefly describe the basic features of the zee mass matrix , as given in eq.([zee - m ] ) .",
    "we first take @xmath37 .",
    "the matrix can be diagonalized by the following transformation @xmath38 with the eigenvalues @xmath39 for @xmath40 , respectively , and @xmath41 . hence",
    ", the two massive states form a dirac pair . the atmospheric mass - squared difference @xmath42 ,",
    "is to be identified with @xmath43 .",
    "the transition probabilities for @xmath44 are @xmath45 if @xmath46 , then @xmath47 .",
    "this mixing angle is exactly what is required in the atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix texture with @xmath37 can be called the zeroth order zee texture .",
    "it is the first thing to aim at in our supersymmetric model discussions in the next section .    if we choose a nonzero @xmath23 , but keep @xmath48 .",
    "then after diagonalizing the matrix we have the following eigenvalues @xmath49 the mass - square difference between @xmath50 and @xmath51 can be fitted to the solar neutrino mass .",
    "for instance , one can take the large angle mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) solution and requires @xmath52 giving @xmath53 where we have used @xmath54 .",
    "we will see below that in our supersymmetric model the couplings that are required to generate the zeroth order zee texture also give rise to other contributions , which have to be kept subdominating in order to maintain the texture and hence the favor of the zee model . even though these extra contributions might not be identified as the same entries as the @xmath55 parameter of eq .",
    "( [ zee - m ] ) , i.e. , appear in the diagonal entries instead , they could still play the same role as to give a phenomenologically viable first order result for a modified zee matrix .",
    "hence , we will not commit ourselves to the first order zee matrix as given in eq.([zee - m ] ) , but only to its zeroth order form , namely with @xmath56 .",
    "the first order perturbation is then allowed to come in through any matrix entry . it will split the mass square degeneracy of the dirac pair similar to the @xmath55 case above . for example , if the first order perturbation is given by a @xmath57 appearing at the @xmath58 entry , the resulting mass eigenvalues are modified to @xmath59 the mass - square difference between @xmath50 and @xmath51 can then be fitted to the solar neutrino data and we obtain @xmath60 , the same as above . if , on the other hand , @xmath57 appears at the @xmath61 or @xmath62 entry , the solar neutrino data can still be fitted and @xmath63 is required .",
    "once the zeroth order zee texture for the atmospheric neutrino is satisfied , it is straightforward to further impose the above condition for the solar neutrino .",
    "first consider the superpotential as given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 are the generation indices .",
    "@xmath67 . in the above equation ,",
    "@xmath68 , and @xmath69 denote the quark doublet , lepton doublet , up - quark singlet , down - quark singlet , lepton singlet , and the two higgs doublet superfields . here",
    "we allow only the @xmath0-parity violation through the terms @xmath70 and @xmath71 with coefficients @xmath72 ( antisymmetric in @xmath17 ) and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the other @xmath0-parity - violating couplings are dropped as they are certainly beyond the minimal framework needed for embedding the zee model .",
    "the soft susy breaking terms that are relevant to our study are @xmath73 actually , the @xmath74 terms do not contribute because our choice of basis eliminates the vev s for @xmath75 s .",
    "this simplifies the analysis without lose of generality .",
    "we adopt the single - vev parametrization , which uses the @xmath76 basis such that the charged - lepton yukawa matrix @xmath77 is diagonal . the whole @xmath78 term will be taken as predominantly diagonal , namely , @xmath79 .",
    "this is just the common practice of suppressing off - diagonal @xmath80 terms , favored by flavor - changing neutral - current constraints .",
    "the tree - level mixing among the higgsinos , gauginos , and neutrinos gives rise to a @xmath81 neutral fermion mass matrix @xmath82 : @xmath83 whose basis is @xmath84 .",
    "each of the charged - lepton states deviates from its physical state as a result of its mixing with higgsino - gaugino through the corresponding @xmath34 term@xcite .",
    "however , we are interested only in a region of the parameter space where the concerned deviations are negligible , as also discussed in ref.@xcite . hence , we are effectively in the basis of the physical charged - lepton states , as indicated . in the above @xmath81 matrix ,",
    "the whole lower - right @xmath36 block @xmath85 is zero at tree level .",
    "they are induced via one - loop contributions to be discussed below .",
    "one - loop contributions to the other zero entries are neglected .",
    "we can write the mass matrix in the form of block submatrices : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the upper - left @xmath88 neutralino mass matrix , @xmath89 is the @xmath90 block , and @xmath91 is the lower - right @xmath36 neutrino block in the @xmath81 matrix .",
    "the resulting neutrino mass matrix after block diagonalization is given by @xmath92 the first term here corresponds to tree level contributions , which are , however , see - saw suppressed .    before going into our best scenario analysis",
    ", we will sketch how the couplings , @xmath72 s and @xmath34 s , lead to the neutrino mass terms .",
    "while some of them have been studied in literature , others are identified here for the first time .",
    "we do this from the perspectives of the supersymmetric zee model , but the results are quite general .",
    "our minimalistic strategy says that a @xmath72 or a @xmath34 should be taken as zero unless it is needed for the zee mechanism to generate the neutrino mass terms @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "readers who find the extensive use of unspecified indices in the following discussions difficult to follow are suggested to match them with the results for the explicit examples that we will list below .",
    "we identify the following four neutrino - mass generation mechanisms .",
    "\\(i ) _ zee mechanism_. we show in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the two zee diagrams for the one - loop neutrino mass terms .",
    "the right - handed slepton @xmath93 is identified as the charged - singlet boson of the zee model , and its coupling to lepton fields has the correct antisymmetric generation indices : see eq .",
    "( [ zcp ] ) . to complete the diagram the charged higgs boson @xmath94 from the higgs doublet @xmath95 is on the other side of the loop and a @xmath93-@xmath96 mixing",
    "is needed at the top of the loop .",
    "such a mixing is provided by a @xmath97 term of @xmath98 : @xmath99 , where @xmath100 takes on its vev , for a nonzero @xmath101 .",
    "thus , the neutrino mass term @xmath102 has a @xmath103 dependence , where @xmath104 s are the charged lepton masses .",
    "\\(ii ) _ @xmath105 slepton mass mixing_. another , well - studied , type of contributions comes from the one - loop diagram with two @xmath28-coupling vertices and the usual @xmath106-type @xmath105 slepton mixing . neglecting the off - diagonal entries in @xmath107 , the contribution to @xmath102 with the pair @xmath108 and @xmath109 is proportional to @xmath110\\ ; m_{\\!\\scriptscriptstyle \\ell_k } m_{\\!\\scriptscriptstyle \\ell_l }    \\lambda_{ilk}\\lambda_{jkl }   \\;.\\ ] ] only @xmath72 s with all distinct indices ( e.g. @xmath111 ) fail to give contributions of this kind on its own .",
    "a nonzero @xmath112 contributes to the diagonal @xmath113 .",
    "an illustration for the term is given in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . with any two nonzero @xmath72 s , this kind of contributions to the @xmath85 entries , in particular the diagonal ones , can not be avoided .",
    "\\(iii ) _ @xmath105 slepton mass mixing via @xmath0-parity violating couplings_. this contribution is identified here for the first time .",
    "while the contributions to generation mixing in the usual @xmath106-type @xmath105 slepton mixing via the off - diagonal entries in @xmath107 are expected to be small , there is another independent source of generation mixing in the @xmath105 slepton - mass mixing , which may not follow the rule .",
    "the latter comes from a @xmath97 term of @xmath76 : @xmath114 , where @xmath100 takes on the vev .",
    "this is similar to the @xmath115 mixing in the zee model , except that this time we have a @xmath28-type coupling instead of the @xmath0-parity - conserving yukawa coupling .",
    "this newly identified source of mixing results in constraints on the @xmath116 products , which is an interesting subject of lepton - slepton phenomenology studies .    with a specific choice of a set of nonzero @xmath34 s and @xmath28 s ,",
    "this type of mixing gives rise to the off - diagonal @xmath102 terms only and , therefore , of particular interest to our perspectives of zee model .",

    "note that the above equation represents a kind of fine - tuned relation between the two couplings @xmath138 and @xmath111 .",
    "more precisely , the value of @xmath198 has to be within a factor of @xmath199 of that of @xmath200 in order to fit @xmath201 .",
    "this feature is inherited directly from the original zee model , as discussed in ref.@xcite . nevertheless , it is difficult to motivate this relation from a theoretical point of view .",
    "phenomenologically , the relation implies that @xmath138 is two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath111 , which indicates a strongly inverted hierarchy against the familiar flavor structure among quarks and charged leptons . since the current experimental bounds from the rare processes , such as @xmath202 , showed the usual hierarchical trend down the families , the relation in eq .",
    "( [ 29 ] ) says that once the constraints on the @xmath111 are satisfied , @xmath138 should be automatically safe .",
    "this justifies our above statement that the @xmath168-decay constraint analogous to eqs .",
    "( [ mudy ] ) and ( [ mudy1 ] ) have no relevancy here .",
    "conversely , if @xmath138 contributions to some rare processes are identified in the near future , it would spell trouble for the susy zee model discussed here .",
    "finally , we comment on whether it is feasible to have an alternative situation in which the second ( @xmath197 dependent ) terms in @xmath24 and @xmath25 dominate over the first ( @xmath187 dependent ) terms .",
    "the comparison between these two types of contributions is similar to that of scenario 1 , as can be easily seen by comparing terms in eqs .",
    "( [ scen1 ] ) and ( [ scen2 ] ) . as in scenario 1",
    ", we need to push @xmath138 to the order of @xmath165 .",
    "this at the same time requires either a particularly large @xmath203 or some fine - tuned cancellation between @xmath204 and @xmath205 in order to fulfill the condition in eq .",
    "( [ 2a ] ) .",
    "thus , it is unlikely to have the second terms of @xmath24 and @xmath25 dominant over the first terms .    to produce the neutrino mass matrix beyond the zeroth order zee texture , the subdominating first - order contributions are required to be substantially smaller in order to fit the solar neutrino data . here",
    ", it is obvious that it is difficult to further suppress the tree level gaugino - higgsino mixing contribution to @xmath62 , which makes it even more difficult to get the scenario to work .",
    "explicitly , the requirement for the solar neutrino is @xmath206 following directly from the result given in sec .",
    "[ cf . eq .",
    "( [ mtt ] ) ] .",
    "we have discussed in detail the minimalistic embedding of the zee model into the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "the conditions for maintaining the zee neutrino mass matrix texture is extremely stringent , if not impossible .",
    "here we discuss some more general versions of supersymmetrization of the zee model .    as mentioned in the introduction , an easy way to complete the zee diagram without the @xmath34-type , bilinear @xmath0-parity - violating ,",
    "couplings is to introduce an additional pair of higgs doublet superfields . denoting them by @xmath207 and @xmath208 , bearing the same quantum numbers as @xmath209 and @xmath69 , respectively , @xmath0-parity - violating terms of the form @xmath210 can be introduced . with a trivial extension of notations ( in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] with @xmath211 replaced by @xmath212 ) , we obtain a zee diagram contribution to @xmath127 through @xmath72 as follows : @xmath213 here the slepton @xmath93 keeps the role of the zee scalar .",
    "we have neglected the @xmath97 term obtainable in the existence of bilinear @xmath30 terms between @xmath207 and @xmath69 or @xmath208 .",
    "at least one of them has to be there .",
    "when no @xmath214 type @xmath0-parity - conserving yukawa couplings are allowed , the only surviving extra contribution to neutrino mass among those discussed is from the one corresponding to expression ( [ aloop ] ) .",
    "notice that the second higgs doublet of the zee model , corresponding to @xmath207 here , is also assumed not to have couplings of the form @xmath214 .",
    "the condition for this @xmath105 slepton mixing contribution to be below the required @xmath24 would be the same as discussed in the previous section",
    ".    however , there is a new contribution to @xmath130 given by @xmath215 which is obtained from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] with @xmath216 replaced by @xmath217 and @xmath218 by @xmath219 ( of course with different couplings at the vertices . )",
    "this is in fact a consequence of the fact that the term @xmath220 provides new mass mixings for the charged higgsinos and the charged leptons . as with the mixings induced by the @xmath34 s ,",
    "the new effect is see - saw suppressed ; but unlike the @xmath34 s their magnitude may be less severely constrained .",
    "nevertheless , the essential difference here is that unlike the @xmath34 terms the @xmath221 term does not contribute to the mixings between neutrinos and the gauginos and higgsinos on tree level .",
    "we will assume also that the deviations of the charged - lepton mass eigenstates resulted from the new mixing are negligible .",
    "bleaching the assumption actually does not cause too much trouble though .",
    "its main effect is simply the modification of the numerical values of @xmath104 s used as the physical masses get extra contributions . here ,",
    "similar to the above we are interested in only the minimal set of couplings @xmath222 with a specific @xmath152 . for expression ( [ h1i ] ) to give the right value to @xmath24 , we need @xmath223 and similarly for @xmath25 , it requires @xmath224 .",
    "this condition is easy to satisfy , for example , when we take @xmath225 .",
    "next , we compare the expression ( [ h1i ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ hkk ] ) . for eq .",
    "( [ h1i ] ) to dominate over eq .",
    "( [ hkk ] ) , it is required that @xmath226 the most favorable scenario under the context is obtained by taking @xmath227 where @xmath228 is just the @xmath229 .",
    "the above requirements are then easily satisfied . in addition , the corresponding requirement for subdomination of the @xmath105 slepton mixing contribution discussed above is then the same as eq .",
    "( [ lamll ] ) , and we also have eq .",
    "( [ mudy ] ) from the tree - level zee - scalar induced muon decay .",
    "all these constraints can now be easily satisfied . hence",
    ", having such a supersymmetric zee model looks very feasible .",
    "one may argue , following the spirit of the single - vev parametrization , that @xmath207 may be arranged to have no vev .",
    "that would apparently kill the scenario .",
    "however , we have an assumption above that there is no @xmath214 term in the superpotential , which is also adopted in the original zee model . without the assumption we could then switch @xmath207 and @xmath209 around , and",
    "though the scenario is still viable it , however , becomes much more complicated to analyze .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath209 was the only one with a vev , @xmath230 should take over the role of @xmath231 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and then the couplings of the @xmath230 to leptons could not be taken diagonal in general .",
    "studies of these more general situations , together with more admissible terms in the superpotential involving @xmath207 , actually worth more attention .",
    "this is however beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "an alternative approach is to give up identifying the right - handed slepton as the zee scalar .",
    "one can introduce a vectorlike pair of zee ( singlet ) superfields @xmath232 and @xmath233 with the scalar component of the latter as the zee scalar .",
    "a @xmath234 term takes the role of the @xmath72 above .",
    "the @xmath97 term of @xmath98 with nonzero @xmath235 and @xmath236 terms provides the mixing between the new zee scalar and the @xmath94 .",
    "but the @xmath237 coupling easily messes up the identity of the physical charged leptons .",
    "it is clear then this is an even more complicated situation than the previous one , and has to be analyzed carefully in a different framework .",
    "finally , one can take the trivial supersymmetrization by taking both @xmath232 and @xmath233 as well as @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "the restrictions on the parameter space of the relevant couplings are then unlikely to have any interesting feature beyond that of the zee model itself .",
    "it is interesting , however , to note that the couplings needed , @xmath238 and @xmath239 , do not break @xmath0 parity at all , though the lepton number is violated .",
    "we have discussed the embedding of the zee neutrino mass model in the framework of @xmath0-parity - violating supersymmetry .",
    "it is a nontrivial supersymmetrization of the zee model in the sense that one or both of the extra scalar fields of the zee model are identified within the minimal supersymmetric sm spectrum .",
    "we have analyzed in detail the minimal scheme where a right - handed slepton plays the role of the charged zee scalar , with no extra higgs doublet introduced .",
    "the @xmath72 and @xmath34 couplings in @xmath0-parity - violating supersymmetry are identified as the lepton - number - violating couplings in the zee model .",
    "nevertheless , the scheme also introduces other types of contributions to neutrino masses .",
    "we have described in detail all these contributions and their general forms .",
    "we have addressed and answered the question on the feasibility of such a model . for the minimal scheme we illustrated",
    "that a set of @xmath0-parity - violating couplings given as @xmath240 with a specific @xmath152 completes the model .",
    "the various contributions to neutrino masses are discussed and the conditions for maintaining the zeroth order zee mass texture and for fitting the experimental neutrino oscillation data are derived . the case with @xmath241 has been shown to be marginally feasible , though the constraints are very stringent . here , the right - handed stau is the zee scalar .",
    "the analysis also illustrates the interesting interplay between different couplings , and the relative strength of each type of contributions .",
    "in particular , we have discussed two contributions both involving the bilinear @xmath0-parity violating couplings @xmath242 , and the trilinear ones .",
    "both contributions have not been discussed before and the zee mechanism does correspond to one of them and the another one involves a new source of @xmath105 slepton mixing .    we have also discussed alternatives to the minimal scheme . among the alternatives , we have considered the interesting case with an extra pair of vectorlike higgs superfields .",
    "a @xmath243 coupling for the superpotential term @xmath244 replaces @xmath242 of the previous case .",
    "constraints on this extended type of models are much weaker , and so having a phenomenologically viable model of this type would not be a problem .",
    "the best scenario in this case is for @xmath227 , namely , taking the selectron as the zee scalar .",
    "more detailed studies of such models worth a serious effort .",
