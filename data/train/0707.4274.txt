    "intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution ( ivr ) in a molecule , from an initially prepared nostationary state , is at the heart of chemical reaction dynamics .",
    "the timescales and mechanisms involved in this process of energy flow have been investigated in great detail by experiments and theory@xcite .",
    "although considerable progress has been made over the years there are many aspects of this phenomenon whose understanding still eludes us .",
    "nevertheless it is expected that there is a part of the ivr mechanism which can be usefully understood based on classical dynamics alone and there is a part of ivr which is intrinsically quantum mechanical .",
    "both classical and quantum mechanisms coexist in a given molecule and give rise to complicated spectral patterns and splittings .",
    "it is now well established that a specific overtone excitation in a molecule will undergo ivr if the initial nonstationary state , zeroth - order bright state ( zobs ) , is coupled to other dark zeroth - order states via strong anharmonic resonances . in such cases",
    "classical dynamics , at various levels of detail and sophistication , can provide useful insights into the timescales and mechanisms of ivr@xcite .",
    "on the other hand if the zobs is not close to any resonance then classically one expects no ivr and hence no fractionation of spectral lines .",
    "however , it is still possible for ivr to occur via quantum routes . in other words",
    "the initial state will mix with other states giving rise to spectral splittings and , possibly , complicated eigenstates .",
    "since the mixing is classically forbidden it would be appropriate to associate some kind of tunneling with such quantum routes to energy flow .",
    "indeed such a suggestion was made over two decades ago@xcite and the term dynamical tunneling was coined .",
    "the notion of tunneling is meaningless without one form of a barrier or other and the term dynamical is prefixed to distinguish from the usual coordinate space tunneling through static potential barriers .",
    "the barriers in dynamical tunneling , in general , are more subtle to identify and exist in the phase space .",
    "dynamical tunneling can have important consequences for the interpretation of molecular spectra since the fingerprints of ivr are spectrally encoded in the form of intensities and splittings .",
    "traditionally dynamical tunneling in the molecular context has been associated with the occurence of local mode@xcite stretches in symmetric molecules .",
    "however it is important to emphasize that the concept of dynamical tunneling is more general - any flow of quantum probability between regions which are classically disconnected is dynamical tunneling .",
    "the identification of classically disconnected regions requires the knowledge of the phase space topology and hence it is not very surprising that dynamical tunneling is inevitably linked to the underlying classical dynamics . in the context of local mode doublets in symmetric systems important",
    "work by jaff and brumer@xcite and kellman@xcite provided classical phase space perspectives on the normal to local transition .",
    "one of the reasons for the interest in the near - degenerate local doublets has to do with their long lifetimes .",
    "thus provided one can experimentally prepare a high overtone , of say the oh - stretch in h@xmath0o , then the extremely small splitting provides a large window of time to perform mode selective chemistry .",
    "the main problem with such an idea is that at such high vibrational excitations other fermi resonances and rovibrational interactions could destroy the degeneracies@xcite .",
    "we hope to shed some light on these issues in this work wherein the system of interest does exhibit close degeneracies despite multiple resonances and a classical phase space which is mixed regular - chaotic .",
    "interestingly , similar issues have been addressed in the context of the existence of discrete breathers in a network of nonlinear oscillators@xcite .",
    "one of the earliest examples in symmetric systems are the local mode doublets observed in the water molecule which were explained by lawton and child as due to dynamical tunneling@xcite .",
    "the experiments@xcite of kerstel _ et.al . _ on unusally slow ( hundreds of picoseconds ) intramolecular vibrational relaxation of ch - stretch excitation in ( ch@xmath1)@xmath1ccch molecule has also been ascribed to dynamical tunneling by stuchebrukhov and marcus@xcite . in this case",
    "the extremely slow ivr out of the ch - stretch is an instance of dynamical tunnneling in nonsymmetric systems . in a later experiment mcilroy and",
    "nesbitt noted multiquantum state mixing due to very small couplings ( 0.1 @xmath2 or less ) in the ch stretch excitation in propyne@xcite .",
    "recent experiments have shown similar effects in the ch - stretch excitations of triazine@xcite and 1-butyne@xcite and there are reasons to expect dynamical tunneling to manifest in general rovibrational spectra@xcite .",
    "much of the theoretical understanding of dynamical tunneling has come about from the analysis of bent triatomic aba molecules .",
    "the focus primarily has been on vibrations and this work is no expception in this regard .",
    "however we note the important work by lehmann@xcite wherein the nontrivial effects arising due to coupling between local modes and rotations are studied in detail .",
    "davis and heller@xcite emphasized a phase space picture and implicated classical resonances in the phase space as the agents of dynamical tunneling .",
    "in this approach classical trajectories trapped in one region of the phase space were imagined to be separated by dynamical barriers , due to the resonances , from symmetrically equivalent regions of the phase space .",
    "the degeneracy is then broken by dynamical tunneling .",
    "a clear demonstration of the role of isolated resonances was provied by ozorio de almeida as well@xcite .",
    "a slightly different picture was provided by sibert , reinhardt and hynes@xcite in their work on energy flow and local mode splittings in the water molecule .",
    "the setting was again in terms of classical nonlinear resonances but the dynamical barrier was identified in angle space as opposed to in action space .",
    "later hutchinson , sibert and hynes@xcite provided an explanation for the quantum energy flow in terms of high order perturbation theory .",
    "stuchebrukhov and marcus@xcite reanalyzed the aba system in terms of chains of off - resonance virtual states ( `` vibrational superexchange '' ) connecting any two degenerate local mode states .",
    "an important result was the equivalence between the vibrational superexchange approach and the usual wkb expression for splittings in a doublewell system .",
    "this equivalence between perturbative and the wkb approaches was shown for a classically integrable case .",
    "demonstration of such an equivalence in more general situations is an open problem . despite seemingly different approaches a crucial ingredient to any description of dynamical tunneling involves the various anharmonic resonances .",
    "depending on the level of excitation the underlying phase space can exhibit several ( near ) equivalent regions separated by nonlinear resonances ( near - integrable phase space ) or chaos ( mixed phase space ) . for large molecules with sufficient density of states , in the near - integrable regime , heller has conjectured@xcite that a nominal 10@xmath3 - 10@xmath4 @xmath2 broadening of spectroscopically prepared zeroth - order states is due to dynamical tunneling between remote regions of phase space facilitated by distant resonances .",
    "the aforementioned conjecture is based on the notion that phase space is the correct setting for an understanding of dynamical tunneling .",
    "it is thus natural to expect the splittings to be sensitive to the structure of the phase space .",
    "it also follows that given the phase space structure one ought to be able to compute the associated splittings .",
    "general forms for splittings can not be written down easily since explicit forms of the dynamical barriers in the phase space , seperating quantum states localized in distant regions of the phase space , can only be provided upon identification of the key nonlinear resonances .",
    "this is also tanatamount to identifying the mechanism of dynamical tunneling and hence ivr .",
    "two factors make this a difficult problem .",
    "firstly , our understanding of global structure of multidimensional classical phase space is still in its infancy . thus without a global view of the phase space at energies corresponding to the doublets",
    "it is difficult to identify the main nonlinear resonances and perhaps the presence of appreciable stochastic layers .",
    "secondly , and related to the first factor , important work over the last decade has established that dynamical tunneling is sensitive not only to the nonlinear resonances@xcite but also to the classical stochasticity@xcite . in the near - integrable regimes dynamical tunneling can be enhanced by many orders of magnitude due to the various nonlinear resonances .",
    "this is called as resonance - assisted tunneling and it has been suggested@xcite that the nonlinear resonances play an important role in mixed phase space scenario as well . in cases where an appreciable chaotic region separates the two symmetry related regular zones one has the phenomenon of chaos - assisted tunneling .",
    "the hallmark of chaos - assisted tunneling is the erratic fluctuations of the splittings@xcite due to chaotic states having nonzero overlaps with the regular doublets .",
    "in particular the splittings show algebraic dependence on @xmath5 as opposed to the integrable @xmath6 scaling .",
    "experiments@xcite on a wide variety of systems have highlighted the role of the phase space structures in dynamical tunneling .",
    "is the evidence for the sensitivity of dynamical tunneling to the phase space structures already present in the molecular spectra ?",
    "the answer to this question , apart from a fundamental viewpoint , is also potentially relevant to mode - specific chemistry and control . in this context , it is significant to note that most of the earlier works in the molecular context have focused on dynamical tunneling where only one resonance was involved with no chaos .",
    "a notable exception is the work of davis and heller@xcite wherein a hint to the role played by classical chaos was provided .",
    "the sensitivity of dynamical tunneling to the underlying phase space structure can have important ramifications in the molecular context .",
    "phase space of molecular systems at higher energies , corresponding to high overtone transitions , are typically a mixture of regular and chaotic regions .",
    "the presence of stochasticity can lead to the dynamical tunneling being enhanced ( or suppressed ) by several orders of magnitude and hence highly mixed states and complicated spectral patterns . even in the near - integrable regimes",
    "tiny induced resonances can arise as a result of the primary resonances which can enhance or suppress dynamical tunneling between symmetry related modes .",
    "alternatively , molecule - field interactions can@xcite lead to creation ( destruction ) of nonlinear resonances which can lead to significant enhancement or supression of energy flow .",
    "the purpose of this work is to establish the role of classical resonances in the near - integrable phase space for dynamical tunneling and the nontrivial effect of higher order induced resonances and perhaps chaos .",
    "we focus on the symmetric case in this work but the role played by the nonlinear resonances is expected to hold in the nonsymmetric situations as well . in the near - integrable regime it is possible for more than one nonlinear resonance zone to manifest in the phase space . in such instances",
    "the single rotor picture@xcite is not sufficient to account for dynamical tunneling .",
    "yet it is shown that hopping across the various resonance islands is an approximate picture that yields qualitative ( and perhaps quantitative ) insights into the splitting patterns .",
    "we start by motivating the model hamiltonian in section  [ modham ] . in section",
    "[ qv ] the concept of dynamical tunneling and quantum viewpoints are illustrated .",
    "the phase space viewpoint and relations to the quantum viewpoint are discussed in section  [ psv0 ] by focusing on specific cases . in section  [ psv1 ]",
    "two issues regarding avoided crossings and influence of very small induced resonances are addressed briefly .",
    "complications due to multiple resonances in the near - integrable limit and the resulting resonance - assisted tunneling are illustrated in section  [ psv2 ] .",
    "the possibility of chaos - assisted tunneling occuring in the system is explored in section  [ psv3 ] .",
    "a brief summary is provided in section  [ summ ] .",
    "as discussed in the introduction attempts to understand dynamical tunneling , from a classical phase space viewpoint , in three or more degrees of freedom systems is ambitious without studying the detailed correspondence in lower dimensions with multiple resonances . in this regard",
    "the effective spectroscopic hamiltonian for water due to baggott@xcite provides a good model system .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath7 with , @xmath8 and @xmath9 describing the anharmonic local stretches @xmath10 , and bend @xmath11 .",
    "the various parameter values are @xmath12 and , @xmath13 @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath14 mode occupancy is @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the harmonic oscillator creation and destruction operators .",
    "the perturbations , anharmonic resonances , @xmath17 connect zeroth - order states @xmath18 , @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the strengths of the resonances are @xmath22 , and @xmath23 @xmath2 . in order to perform detailed studies on the above hamiltonian in this work",
    "we also analyze subsystems obtained by retaining specific resonances .",
    "these subsystems , denoted by @xmath24 and @xmath25 , are described by the hamiltonians @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively .",
    "the full system with all the resonances will be denoted by @xmath28 .",
    "the reason for this specific choice of subsystems has to do with the fact that classically @xmath29 and @xmath30 exhibit near - integrable dynamics whereas @xmath31 has mixed regular - chaotic dynamics .",
    "@xmath32 is effectively two dimensional due to the existence of the conserved polyad @xmath33 _ i.e. , _ @xmath34=0 $ ] .",
    "spectroscopic hamiltonians can be obtained by a fit to the high resolution spectra or from a perturbative analysis of an existing high quality _ ab initio _ potential energy surface@xcite . in any case",
    "such hamiltonians , and variants thereof , have proved quite useful in studying the highly excited vibrations of many small molecules@xcite .",
    "couplings to rotations and large amplitude modes are certainly important@xcite but a detailed phase space analysis of such general rovibrational hamiltonians is beyond the scope of this work",
    ".    the classical limit@xcite of the above hamiltonian can be obtained by using the heisenberg correspondence , @xmath35 , and results in a nonlinear multiresonant hamiltonian @xmath36 \\nonumber   \\label{cham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath37 corresponding to the action - angle variables associated with the mode @xmath38 .",
    "note that the actions @xmath39 and the zeroth - order quantum numbers @xmath40 are related by the correspondence @xmath41 for simple vibrations .",
    "the various resonant couplings are realted to the quantum coupling strengths by @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "we note that another reason for the choice of this system has to do with the fact that fairly detailed classical - quantum correspondence studies of the highly excited eigenstates have been already performed@xcite .    in this study the focus is on a specific set of molecular parameters ( provided above ) which are representative of the h@xmath0o molecule@xcite .",
    "however , at the outset , we emphasize that this choice is by no means special for the analysis and conclusions of this work .",
    "the goal of this work is not to provide accurate quantitative estimates for the splittings - something that can be trivially calculated quantum mechanically for the model hamiltonian .",
    "the emphasis here is on establishing and understanding , qualitatively , the important role of nonlinear resonances in dynamical tunneling and for this purpose the above model hamiltonian provides a good paradigm .",
    "in particular we choose the states corresponding to the polyad @xmath45 which lie in a energy range of @xmath46 $ ] @xmath2 above the ground state .",
    "there are two main reasons for such a choice .",
    "firstly the motivation is to understand aspects of dynamical tunneling for excited vibrational states both in the presence of nonlinear resonances and chaos@xcite .",
    "secondly the exhaustive compilation@xcite of the experimental energy levels of h@xmath0o by tennyson _ et.al .",
    "_ does show three doublets in this energy region . in local mode notation",
    "these doublets are @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "a few other local modes are also reported with only one of the parity states like @xmath49 .",
    "although the effective hamiltonian used here is perhaps not the best it still provides some correspondence to the patterns observed in the experimental results .",
    "moreover at such high levels of excitation , certainly for the bending mode , there can be significant interpolyad mixings@xcite which require analyzing a three degree of freedom system .",
    "thus we use the effective hamiltonian as a toy model which would guide further , more rigorous , studies in full dimensionality . to give an idea about the validity of the effective hamiltonian in the chosen energy range , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the energy levels as compared to the experimental levels and the agreement is satisfactory .    .",
    "the full system is denoted by c and some of the experimental energy levels are shown as open circles .",
    "b and a show the energy levels for the subsystems with specific resonances removed . some of the closely spaced doublets are indicated by @xmath50 . in c",
    "the box around the top three levels indicates levels with @xmath51 , and @xmath52 quanta of excitation in the stretch mode.,width=288,height=288 ]",
    "in the rest of the paper the zeroth - order states will be denoted by @xmath53 since the bend quantum number @xmath54 is fixed by the polyad @xmath55 . in order to illustrate the concept of dynamical tunneling we consider zeroth - order degenerate states @xmath56 and @xmath57 with only the 2:1 resonances present _",
    "@xmath58 in eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] . as @xmath59 the state @xmath56 has no direct coupling to the symmetric counterpart @xmath57 .",
    "nonetheless there is an indirect coupling via the 2:1 resonances .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a the zeroth - order state is quite far from the region of state space which can potentially come under the influence of the 2:1 anharmonic resonances .",
    "a classical trajectory initiated with initial conditions corresponding to the state @xmath60 will continue to stay in that region of the phase space forever without reaching the symmetric region corresponding to the state @xmath57 .",
    "one such classical trajectory , for about @xmath61 ns , in phase space is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ( inset ) .",
    "this classical trapping occurs despite no apparent energetic barriers since in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a we show the classical actions satisfying @xmath62 which connects the two states .",
    "however , contrary to the classical observation , in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b the quantum survival probability of the state @xmath56 shows transfer of population to @xmath57 with a period of about @xmath63 ns . in a two - state approximation this corresponds to a splitting of the degenerate levels @xmath64 @xmath2 .",
    "_ this is the phenomenon of dynamical tunneling . _",
    "previous discussions@xcite of dynamical tunneling have used the effective hamiltonian with only the primary 1:1 present . here",
    "we delibrately show this effect with the 2:1s only to emphasize the role of induced resonances .",
    "a possible explanation of the tunneling arises from the vibrational superexchange@xcite perspective wherein zeroth - order states coupled locally by the 2:1 perturbations to @xmath56 and @xmath57 are considered .",
    "one then constructs all possible perturbative chains connecting the states @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "an example of such a chain , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , is @xmath65 with @xmath66 . in principle",
    "there are an infinite number of chains that connect the two degenerate states . in practice , due to the energy denominators it is sufficient to consider the minimal length chains@xcite . by minimal length chains",
    "one means inclusion of all possible perturbative terms at the lowest order of perturbation necessary .",
    "for instance in the example above it is necessary to go to atleast fourth order in perturbation theory , thus scaling like @xmath67 , to get a finite value for the splitting . in our case",
    "there are six minimal chains and summing the contributions one obtains a splitting of about @xmath68 @xmath2 which compares well with the exact splitting .",
    "more generally , splitting for any set of degenerate states @xmath69 and @xmath70 , at minimal order , can be calculated as@xcite : @xmath71 with @xmath72 being an index of all possible chains @xmath73 for a particular choice of @xmath74 satisfying the constraint @xmath75 .",
    "indeed such a calculation can be done on our model system and the resulting perturbative estimates are compared to the exact splittings in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . for further discussions the superexchange calculations",
    "have been compared to the exact results for cases @xmath76 , and @xmath28 . at the outset note that the perturbative calculations essentially reproduce , to quantitative accuracy , almost all of the splittings",
    "this degree of accuracy , given high orders of perturbation and number of chains , is pleasantly surprising .",
    "for instance the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows that @xmath77 contributions of varying signs , some as large as @xmath78 , conspire to yield the correct splitting of about @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
    "two important observations can be made at this juncture .",
    "first , the significant role of the tiny 2:2 resonance is clear in that addition of this 2:2 to the 2:1s enhances the splittings by many orders of magnitude - something which is not readily apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for even values of @xmath81 , especially @xmath82 ,",
    "this is expected since the 2:2 provides a dominant coupling .",
    "in fact for @xmath82 one expects @xmath83 @xmath2 which compares very well to the exact value of @xmath84 @xmath2 .",
    "however , it is significant to note that such a calculation for @xmath85 is too small by a factor of five and that the odd @xmath81 states would not split at all in the presence of a 2:2 coupling alone .",
    "secondly in all three cases @xmath76 , and @xmath28 the splittings more or less monotonically decrease with increasing stretch excitations .",
    "the one exception is in the full system ( case @xmath28 ) for the state with @xmath86 .",
    "later it is shown that this is an instance of suppression of tunneling due to an avoided crossing between the doublet and a third intruder state .",
    "incidentally in the experimental data@xcite pertaining to @xmath86 among the doublets , denoted in the local mode basis as @xmath87 , only the state @xmath49 is reported@xcite .",
    "this , given our model hamiltonian , could be a pure accident !    .",
    "the states are @xmath57 and @xmath56 .",
    "( a ) the state space for polyad @xmath45 is shown with the regions strongly influenced by the 2:1 anharmonic resonances .",
    "an example of a minimal ( solid ) superexchange chain connecting the states is shown . the energy contour satisfying @xmath62 is shown connecting the two states .",
    "( b ) quantum survival probabilties for @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( squares ) are shown for @xmath61 ns . note the almost coherent transfer of population with a period of @xmath63 ns .",
    "the inset shows a classical trajectory initiated near @xmath56 for a time period of about @xmath61 ns . the time variations of the actions @xmath88 and @xmath89 are shown as filled and unfilled circles respectively .",
    "the actions stay trapped for the entire period.,width=288,height=192 ]    , in @xmath2 , to the superexchange results ( lines ) . shown",
    "are the splitting between the states @xmath90 and @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath91 cases are not shown for the full system since on inclusion of the large 1:1 they are not local modes but resonant normal modes with large splittings .",
    "the experimental values for the splitting for @xmath92 are shown as filled circles for comparison .",
    "the arrow indicates the substantial deviation of the superexchange result from the exact value for @xmath86 .",
    "the inset shows the contribution from @xmath77 terms for the superexchange calculation of @xmath80 in case a.,width=288,height=288 ]    it is important to note that the superexchange approach invokes the 2:1 resonant terms without any reference to the classical phase space .",
    "this surprisingly good accuracy seems to hold whenever the phase space is integrable or near - integrable and is perhaps related to the equivalence of the superexchange to the wkb approach@xcite .",
    "if this observation is true in multidimensional systems then a phase space perspective on dynamical tunneling should be able to provide some insights .",
    "apart from providing a phase space analog to the superexchange approach it would also be possible to study the extent of sensitvity of dynamical tunneling to the various classical structures .",
    "the rest of the paper is dedicated to uncovering precisely such a phase space picture .",
    "in what follows , the classical poincar surface of sections are plotted in @xmath93 at constant values of the sectioning angle @xmath94 with @xmath95 . in this representation",
    "the normal - mode resonant regions appear around @xmath96 .",
    "local modes regions correspond to above and below the normal - mode regions and large 2:1 bend / local - stretch resonant islands appear in the local mode regions .",
    "we begin by asking the question as to what possible structure in the classical phase space is mediating the dynamical tunneling in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b . the answer , based on earlier@xcite works , should involve a nonlinear resonance zone in the phase space .",
    "indeed the poincar surface of section at @xmath97 @xmath2 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] indicates a resonance zone juxtaposed between the zeroth - order states as seen in the phase space .",
    "the surface of section is consistent with the state space view in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a in that the primary 2:1 resonances do not appear in the phase space .",
    "the 2:1 resonance zones , if present , would show up in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a around @xmath98 .",
    "hence a direct involvement of the 2:1 resonances is ruled out but surely the existence of the 2:1s must be giving rise to a dynamical barrier , in the form of the observed resonance zone , mediating the tunneling . in order to confirm that this nonlinear resonance is mediating the dynamical tuneling it is necessary to extract an explicit expression for the dynamical barrier and",
    "obtain the splitting .",
    "for this purpose we apply methods of nonlinear dynamics@xcite on the classical hamiltonian eq.4 with @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",

    "the above two - dimensional hamiltonian contains the 2:1 resonances and hence nonintegrable .",
    "however the phase space from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] suggests that at @xmath110 the 2:1s do not have a direct role to play .",

    "the order and widths of the resonances determine the explicit dynamical barriers in the zeroth - order action ( quantum number ) space .",
    "the current study indicates that it is safer to blame dynamical tunneling on the nonlinear resonances without invoking further connections between avoided crossings and the resonances .",
    "if accidental avoided crossings occur , as they do in near - integrable , mixed and chaotic systems , then dynamical tunneling can be enhanced or suppressed further .",
    "this study also lends support to earlier suggestions@xcite that even very small resonant couplings can be the cause of the experimentally observed narrow spectral clusters .",

    "not only is it important to identify the relevant resonance zones but it is also necessary to prescribe a route to calculate the splittings .",
    "it is significant to note that neither of these problems are easy to solve . again , and not surprisingly , the lack of understanding of the structure of multidimensional phase space is the main bottleneck . in this regard",
    "the superexchange approach works well but such an accuracy for high dimensional systems , with mixed regular - chaotic phase spaces , is not guaranteed . as shown in the present work and in a previous work@xcite",
    "the superexchange approach is prone to errors , atleast by an order of magnitude , whenever states are involved in avoided crossings .",
    "it remains to be seen if going beyond the minimal paths prescription , with some clever resummation tricks , would lead to quantitative improvements .",
    "we have shown that treating the resonance zones as pendulums and coupling across them to connect the two nearly degenerate states provides an approximate route to calculating the tunnel splittings .",
    "this chain of resonance zones , in some sense , provides a semiclassical basis for the success of the vibrational superexchange approach .",
    "the current work has shown the close correspondence between various terms contributing in the superexchange approach and the underlying resonances in the phase space .",
    "the superexchange mechanism itself has its roots in the field of electron transfer in molecular systems@xcite . in this context",

    "regarding the various mechanisms of dynamical tunneling in molecules this work suggests that for small molecules with low density of states ( large effective @xmath5 ) the dominant mechanism would be resonance - assisted . for molecules with sufficiently high density of states ( sufficiently small effective @xmath5 )",
    "both chaos and resonances can mediate dynamical tunneling and the dominant mechanism is decided by the energy of the doublets and the location of the doublets in the corresponding phase space .",
    "although the analysis was on coupled three - mode systems the conclusion remains valid in general for systems which exhibit local mode behaviour .",
    "this is based on our analysis , along similar lines , for many other systems which are described more naturally by local ( d@xmath0o , h@xmath0s ) or normal mode ( so@xmath0 ) limits . for systems with small or vanishing anharmonicities , where the issue of the existence of localized modes itself is moot , the various resonances are still important but any calculation based on a pendulum approximation is clearly invalid .",
    "thus spectra of molecules involving light atom stretch - bend modes are good candidates to observe the fingerprints of dynamical tunneling .",
    "in particular we suggest the high overtone spectral regions of the water molecule as one possibility .",
    "this suggestion is tentative since a model hamiltonian has been utilized for the analysis and it is probable that the polyad picture will break down at such high energies .",
    "one possibility is to do a detailed analysis on the best potential energy surface available and/or explicitly break the polyad by adding further weak resonances .",
    "both approaches result in genuine three degree of freedom phase spaces and thus a straightforward extension is not easy .",
    "apart from the limitation in visualizing the global phase space structures this has to do with the fact that there are classical phenomena@xcite in three or more degrees of freedom that could modify certain aspects of the lower dimensional analysis .",
    "for instance in three or higher degree of freedom systems two long time phenomena are controlled by nonlinear resonances - arnold diffusion@xcite and dynamical tunneling .",
    "precious little is known about either of these phenomena and their possible spectral manifestations in such situations and needs further study@xcite . as a final note we comment on the possibility of observing long lived local excitations in systems with multiple resonances",
    "this work shows that additional resonances can modify the near - degeneracies via cat and rat .",
    "but this modification , by the same additional resonances and resulting chaos , can go either way due to multistate interactions ! moreover , as shown in this work , additional resonances and presumably coupling to rotations@xcite can also conspire to increase the degeneracy .",
    "coherent manipulation of tunneling using external fields has been demonstrated before@xcite and there are reasons to think that such ideas can be utilized in the present context as well .",

    "<S> it is also argued that the , presumed , relation of avoided crossings to nonlinear resonances does not have to be invoked in order to understand dynamical tunneling . for molecules with low density of states </S>",
