    "the long - awaited higgs particle @xmath0 around 125 gev has been observed at the lhc by atlas @xcite and cms @xcite with the combined significances of 5.9 and 5.0 standard deviations , respectively .",
    "excesses of events have been shown in various channels , such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "although the precise determination of the new particle s properties requires future accumulation of data , the results at the moment are fully consistent with the standard model(sm ) .",
    "the higgs field plays a special role in the sm . not only it is the only scalar particle , but also it is responsible for all other particles masses .",
    "modern particle physics is tightly related with symmetry principles .",
    "particles in the sm do not interact randomly , but follow a pattern described by gauge theory .",
    "the gauge group for the sm is the @xmath4(@xmath5 stands for color , @xmath6 for left - handed , and @xmath7 for hypercharge ) , of which @xmath8 rules the strong interaction and @xmath9 for the electroweak interactions .",
    "and the higgs field governs the breaking of @xmath9 into @xmath10(@xmath11 for electric charge ) .",
    "sm is ultra - violet(uv ) complete and renormalizable due the higgs mechanism , which means that it can be valid to very high energies .",
    "although there exist experimental observations that motivate to extend the sm , they can be easily accommodated by slightly extension without spoiling the uv properties of sm . on the other hand , the intrinsic theoretical issues , such as hierarchy problem ,",
    "could guide us to modify the theory completely .    in the brief review , we are concerned of vacuum stability , an other theoretical issue in the sm .",
    "we first give an overview of the higgs sector in the sm and then discuss several theoretical constraints on the mass of the higgs boson .",
    "later , vacuum stability , metastability and instability are briefly reviewed and finally the summary is given .",
    "details and complete discussions are referred to @xcite .",
    "the standard model composes of fermion , gauge and scalar sectors . the scalar particle",
    "is usually called higgs boson , due to its role played in the spontaneous symmetry breaking of electroweak group , @xmath9 . in the sm , except for the neutrinos , all fermions are massive and have left - handed and right - handed parts , denoted collectively and respectively as @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 since @xmath12 and @xmath13 transform differently , the mass term @xmath15 is not gauge invariant .",
    "we need to add new fields to restore the symmetry . in the sm",
    "a single scalar @xmath16 doublet is introduced for the gauge invariant interactions , @xmath17 flavor and color index are ignored for discussion in this paper .",
    "the potential with all gauge invariant and renormalizable terms is @xmath18 @xmath19 is an irrelevant constant for quantum field theory but may be very important for cosmology .",
    "so we should omit @xmath19 in the following discussion .",
    "the minus sign in front of @xmath20 is necessary for having a vacuum state , @xmath21 to trigger the ew symmetry breaking , @xmath22 .",
    "we can expand the doublet as @xmath23 here @xmath0 is the physical higgs field . @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the goldstone modes , to be `` eaten '' by @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "after the breaking fermions and gauge bosons get masses , @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the @xmath31 and @xmath32 gauge couplings defined at scale @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "photon , relic of the symmetry breaking , is associated with the unbroken @xmath34 and is still massless .    in the unitary gauge , before symmetry breaking , the scalar doublet can be written as @xmath35 in such a gauge , only physical fields appear in the theory , ghosts and goldstone modes do not show from the very beginning .",
    "then the potential turns to a function of the single variable , @xmath36 after the @xmath37 develops a vev , @xmath38 , all particles in the sm get masses and for the higgs particle @xmath0 , @xmath39 because @xmath40 in sm is determined by measuring the mass of weak gauge boson , then the sole undetermined parameter is the mass of higgs boson @xmath41 or equivalently the self - interaction coupling @xmath42 . if we interpret the recently - discovered particle as the sm higgs boson , the @xmath43 , we now has fixed all the parameters in the sm",
    "before the lhc era , various theoretical considerations has already constrained the parameters in the higgs potential , including unitarity , triviality and vacuum stability @xcite . of them ,",
    "the later two are related to the potential and renormalization group running while unitarity bound comes from the constraints on the scattering process of longitudinal weak gauge bosons . in this section , we shall only concentrate on triviality and vacuum stability .    the discussion in sec .",
    "( [ sec : higgs ] ) is based on the tree level potential and it is not straightforward to see how constraints can be put on . for a realistic and consistent consideration , the quantum effective potential @xmath44 is needed .",
    "quantum loop corrections will make the mass parameter and coupling dependent on the sliding scale @xmath45 , @xmath46 here we have set the scale @xmath45 to the field value @xmath37 .",
    "for discussion of vacuum stability the first term can be omitted as long as large field value @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath42 for the quartic term is running with the energy scale @xmath45 @xmath48 and at one loop order @xmath49 is given by @xmath50.\\ ] ] for later convenience , we point out the origins of the individual terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rgeoneloop ] ) .",
    "@xmath51 comes from the higgs self - interaction s contribution , @xmath52 from the top quarks loop , @xmath53 from the gauge boson loop and the last term from higgs field renormalization .",
    "the relative sign between bosonic and fermionic contributions would dramatically affect the uv behavior of the theory .",
    "_ triviality _ : first let us consider an illumination that @xmath42 s contribution is dominant so that we can neglect the fermion and gauge boson terms in eq .",

    "if we would like to avoid the landau pole , the @xmath42 at the input should be zero , leading to a non - interacting and trivial theory @xcite which can not provide the spontaneous symmetry breaking . however , practically it is still possible and safe to leave landau pole beyond the planck scale .",
    "all we need is a light higgs boson .     and",
    "@xmath66 , respectively .",
    "and the dot - dashed and doted lines displays the vacuum stability constraints for @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .",

    "perturbatively we can have a calculable theory up to energy scale up to @xmath66 .",
    "the fig .",
    "( [ fig : constraint ] ) shows that how the scale at which the theory turns to non - perturbative depends on the @xmath41 defined at the electroweak scale .",
    "the two lines(solid and dashed ) correspond @xmath73 and @xmath66 . for a light higgs boson",
    ", sm can be perturbative all the way to planck scale , and it gets non - perturbative near @xmath74 if @xmath75 .",
    "_ vacuum stability _ : as shown above , lighter higgs boson means larger non - perturbative scale .",
    "however , if too light the theory is confronted with another problem , vacuum instability .",
    "this is due to the heavy quark s contribution .",
    "now we investigate the fermion s effect .",
    "again just considering the only term in the @xmath76 @xmath77.\\ ] ] we can solve @xmath56 analytically when neglect the running for the @xmath78 @xmath79 for a complete and consistent investigation , we must solve all the coupled rges .",
    "but just for showing the physical effect of @xmath80 the simplification is enough .",
    "it is immediate to see that at some scale , @xmath81 can cross zero and turn to negative .",
    "then the potential is unbounded and the electroweak vacuum @xmath82 may be unstable due to the quantum tunneling .",
    "two lower lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : constraint ] show how the scale at which @xmath56 cross zero depends on the mass of the higgs boson .",
    "different lines display effects of the fermion s mass .     in standard model .",
    "black solid line is plotted with @xmath83 gev and @xmath84 . dotted and",
    "dot - dashed lines shows the effects of changing mass of @xmath85 , for @xmath86 gev and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "two lines , closer to the solid one , display the effects of different value for @xmath88 , dashed one for @xmath89 and long dashed for @xmath90 . ]    the realistic case in the standard model is show in the fig .",
    "( [ fig : sm_stability ] ) , where we show effects of variation on @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "this is done by including one loop rges for top quark s yukawa coupling , @xmath93,\\ ] ] and for the gauge couplings @xmath94 , @xmath95 note that the above definition for @xmath96 is different from @xmath97 used usually for unification consideration , @xmath98 . in that case , the corresponding coefficients in the rges also need to change . the relevant input and rg equations in the numerical evaluations are listed below @xcite , @xmath99",
    "+    details of vacuum stability @xcite depend on the behavior of the effective potential @xcite .",
    "there are several configurations for the effective potential as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : veff ] ) . if the potential has only one minimum as case ( a ) , then the vacuum is absolutely stable .",
    "even there is another local minimum ( b ) but higher than the electroweak one , it is still stable and one can even use the configuration to inflate our universe in scalar - tenor framework @xcite . other effects on inflation and fermion masses are discussed in @xcite .",
    "vacuum stability up to planck scale put constraint for the mass of the higgs boson @xcite , @xmath100>129.5 + 1.4\\left(\\frac{m_t[\\gev]-173.1}{0.7}\\right ) - 0.5\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s(m_z)-0.1184}{0.0007}\\right).\\ ] ] complexity emerges when another local minimum at large field is as the same as or deeper than the ew one(c , d and e ) .",
    "then quantum tunneling effects from ew vacuum to the deeper one could make vacuum decay . if the life time is larger than the age of our universe , then the vacuum is metastable(c and d ) @xcite . if not , we have an unstable vacuum(e ) .",
    "the last one(c ) the potential basically is unbounded from below , the vacuum then is definitely unstable .    the formalism that quantitatively determines the decay rate of the false vacuum and the calculation procedures in general field theory was first developed semi - classically in @xcite and quantum mechanically in @xcite .",
    "the calculation in the sm is well described in @xcite and meta - stability in detail for @xmath101 sm higgs boson is discussed in @xcite .",
    "_ save stability _",
    ": there exists many and easy ways to save the electroweak vacuum stability up to planck scale @xcite .",
    "all of them are involved with changes on the standard model , based on different well - motivated considerations .",
    "for instance , adding a higgs portal singlet scalar will modifies the @xmath76 with an extra bosonic contribution and this term can serve to stablize the vacuum to higher scale .",
    "one can also introduce many matter fields charged under sm gauge group and in this case gauge coupling could turn larger at higher scale , which indirectly affect @xmath76 as extra bosonic contributions .",
    "two examples are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : savestability ] ) , dashed line for a singlet and dot - dashed one for a multiplet model , respectively .",
    "it is easily seen that @xmath102 is positive all the way to planck scale , leading to a stable vacuum .     and its self - coupling @xmath103 .",
    "dot - dashed line shows a multiplet s contribution .",

    "in this paper , we give a brief review of the theoretical constraints on the mass of the higgs boson in the standard model .",
    "we mainly focus on triviality and vacuum stability . with the discovery of 125 gev higgs boson at the lhc",
    ", the standard model does not have a stable vacuum if no new physics is assumed .",
