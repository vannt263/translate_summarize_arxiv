    "magnetic fields are known to be dynamically important in a variety of flows , for example in the liquid core of the earth , in stars and galaxies , and they also play a role at the atomic level , e.g. , in bose - einstein condensates @xcite . their origin in astrophysics and geophysics is still ill - understood , and their dynamics in the fully nonlinear regime once the magnetic field has grown , possibly to quasi - equipartition with the velocity , is ill - understood as well .",
    "numerous studies have shown , though , that magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence differs in several ways from classical hydrodynamic turbulence ; for example , it is more intermittent than fluids @xcite , more so in particular in two space dimensions , and this intermittency may be either time - dependent or dynamically constrained as observations of solar active regions show @xcite .",
    "furthermore , numerical and theoretical arguments indicate that mhd turbulence is less local than hydrodynamic turbulence @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and that mhd may lack universality in its scaling properties @xcite , including in the absence of an imposed uniform magnetic field @xcite .",
    "finally , the role of the correlation between the velocity and the magnetic field has been known for a long time to be important , and this was particularly emphasized when deriving an exact law involving linear scaling with distance of third - order structure functions @xcite ( see @xcite for the von krmn relations for mhd in terms of correlation functions ) .",
    "part of these differences may stem from the fact that , even in the incompressible mhd case , the system supports waves due to the effect of a large - scale magnetic field ( hence the non - locality ) , whereas there are no such waves in incompressible hydrodynamics in the absence of external agents such as gravity or rotation .",
    "of course , at small scales , plasma kinetic effects will come into play ( e.g. , in space plasmas ) , rendering the analysis more difficult .",
    "but even when one ignores such small - scale effects and concentrates on the dynamics of the large scales , one is still left with a variety of observations and of phenomenological approaches to the problem .",
    "a wealth of new space data has come with the cluster mission ( which uses four identical spacecrafts to study the earth s magnetosphere ) , and future projects such as the magnetospheric multiscale ( mms ) mission will allow for more in - depth studies of mhd turbulence , albeit in a complex setting involving compressibility , boundary conditions , and geometrical effects as well as the aforementioned plasma phenomena .",
    "mhd turbulence can also be studied in the laboratory , although achieving high magnetic reynolds numbers in liquid metals will remain a challenge for some time to come .    of particular interest",
    "is how energy is distributed across scales in mhd turbulence .",
    "for the moment there is no clear - cut answer , with some indications that universality may be breaking @xcite , but with the parameter(s ) distinguishing between possible different classes of solutions not well - known .",
    "direct numerical simulations ( dns ) played an important role in these findings , as they allow for a rather controlled exploration of solutions , with well - defined parameters , but with the disadvantage that , in three space dimensions , the resolutions that are attainable with present - day computers are insufficient , by far , if one wants to model realistic geophysical and astrophysical flows with huge reynolds numbers . also , the computational cost of a detailed study of parameter space at sufficiently high resolution is currently out of reach .    one way out of this conundrum , in part , is to resort to modeling .",
    "there are numerous methods that have been devised over the years ( see , e.g. , recent reviews for fluids @xcite and for mhd @xcite ) . among them , the lagrangian averaged mhd model ( lamhd hereafter ) developed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) seems promising in that it allows to perform a quasi - dns , in the sense that the reynolds number is known and that the inertial range is extended , compared to a dns performed on the same grid without the model , thanks to a different formulation of the equations that preserves the invariants , albeit in a different norm ( see below ) .    in this context , we investigate properties of decaying mhd turbulence in the absence of an imposed uniform magnetic field using the lamhd model .",
    "we thoroughly tested the lamhd model previously , in two dimensions @xcite and in three dimensions @xcite . here",
    "we extend our computations to an equivalent grid resolution of the order of @xmath0 points , with taylor reynolds number at the maximum of dissipation of @xmath1 .",

    "the potential @xmath7 and the pressure divided by the constant ( unit ) density @xmath8 are obtained self - consistently to ensure respectively the coulomb gauge and the incompressibility of the velocity field .",
    "the kinematic viscosity is @xmath9 and the magnetic diffusivity @xmath10 ; @xmath11 is the vorticity , and @xmath12 is the current density . the magnetic prandtl number @xmath13 is taken in what follows equal to unity .    in the absence of dissipation ( @xmath14 ) ,",
    "the total energy @xmath15 is conserved ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively the kinetic and magnetic energy , and @xmath18 denotes @xmath19 norms ) .",
    "two other quadratic quantities are preserved by the nonlinear terms in three dimensions ( 3d ) : the cross - correlation @xmath20 , and the magnetic helicity @xmath21 .",
    "the lagrangian averaged model introduces _ a priori _ two filtering lengths , @xmath22 , for the velocity and the magnetic fields in such a way that the conservative structure of the equations is preserved @xcite .",
    "written in terms of the rough fields @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath6 , and of the filtered fields @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the lamhd equations read : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a modified pressure , @xmath30 a modified potential , and with filtering being accomplished through normalized convolution filters @xmath31 chosen to be the inverse of a helmholtz operator , namely @xmath32 .",
    "the filtering lengths are related to the ratio of the dissipation scales of the lamhd flow and the modeled mhd flow @xcite ; since we shall investigate flows with unit magnetic prandtl number , we take a common filter length for both the velocity and magnetic field , @xmath33 .",

    "taylor wavenumbers are defined as @xmath50 .",
    "the numerical implementation of the lamhd equations is performed using a pseudo - spectral code for which inversion of the helmholtz operator is straightforward .",
    "the code is parallelized using mpi ( message passing interface ) and has been tested in a variety of conditions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ; a hybrid version of the code , using openmp as well , allows efficient parallelization for higher resolutions using a larger number of processors @xcite .",
    "the computational box has a size of @xmath51 , and wavenumbers vary from @xmath52 to @xmath53 using a standard 2/3 de - aliasing rule , @xmath54 being the number of grid points per direction .",
    "the dynamics of mhd turbulence is quite complex and there may be different regimes , as characterized for example by their energy spectra , either isotropic or anisotropic depending on the presence of an imposed uniform magnetic field @xmath55 . with @xmath56 and no forcing ,",
    "a high resolution dns using @xmath57 grid points @xcite showed evidence of isotropic iroshnikov - kraichnan ( hereafter , ik ) energy scaling @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was shown @xcite that energy spectra may differ measurably even when global quantities ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 ) are the same at the initial time : ik - like , weak turbulence like ( hereafter , wt ) @xcite , or kolmogorov - like spectra ( hereafter , k41 ) @xcite were obtained , the discriminating factor being the ratio of alfvnic time @xmath62 to the eddy turn - over time @xmath63 .",

    ", we examine one of these cases further by performing computations at higher reynolds number using the lamhd model , resulting in an equivalent grid of roughly @xmath0 points and a taylor reynolds number of @xmath1 . the case of interest",

    "the choice of a shallower distribution of random noise in @xcite was guided by the desire to reach the maximum of dissipation in a short computational time ; the computational constraint not being so strong in the lamhd model , we resort to a steeper initial random distribution so as to let turbulent spectra evolve in a less constrained manner , allowing us to examine in this paper as well whether qualitative differences in behavior take place or not under such a change .",
    "the steeper distribution of noise here also results in slightly different values for the relative initial helicities ( when compared with the run in @xcite ) , defined respectively as @xmath81 here , @xmath82 is the @xmath19 norm of the vector potential , and @xmath83 is the kinetic helicity , which measures deviations from mirror symmetry in the hydrodynamic flow . because of schwarz inequality , we have @xmath84 .    the resulting flow at @xmath85 has @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 , compared to @xmath86 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 for the dns run in @xcite , leading to stronger nonlinearities and faster initial evolution in the previous work .",

    "the correlation time @xmath186 can be taken to be the eddy turn - over time , @xmath191 , since the induction effect given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : equipar3 ] ) is associated with deformation of magnetic field lines by turbulent eddies . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : equipar3 ] ) , assuming again that the temporal evolution follows the eddy turn - over time @xmath63 , i.e. , by approximating @xmath192 , we find @xmath193 from which eq .",
    "( [ eq : equipar2 ] ) follows .",
    "these phenomenological considerations show that the regeneration of the magnetic field by dynamo action is in fact compatible with an alfvnic balance , and that these two processes may be occurring on similar time scales in mhd turbulence . in a decaying flow such as here",
    ", there may not be sufficient time available to see such alfvnic and dynamo exchanges take place repeatedly , but it would be of interest to examine the helicity exchanges in a forced flow ; this may provide a geometrical origin of nization , through the dynamic alignment of relevant vectors , as is known to occur on a nonlinear time scale @xcite .    the constraint given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : hm ] ) is compatible with the spectrum of magnetic helicity observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : mhel ] . in hydrodynamic turbulence , @xmath194 @xcite , and under this assumption @xmath195",
    "( in this simulation , the ratio @xmath196 decays slightly faster with @xmath97 ) . for @xmath197 or steeper , then @xmath198 or steeper . the @xmath145 law in fig .",
    "[ fig : mhel ] seems therefore consistent with a transfer of the helicity towards smaller scales by the direct energy cascade , to satisfy the balance imposed by nization or induction .",
    "we finally consider the spectrum of residual helicity from the point of view of nization . to derive its scaling , we assume that , similarly to the residual energy case , we have : @xmath199 the cross - correlation appears here for at least two reasons : on the one hand , helicity is a pseudo - scalar and thus the r.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ hr ] ) must involve a pseudo - scalar as well . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that total energy and cross - correlation play inter - linked roles in the dynamics of mhd flows .",
    "this is particularly striking when writing the exact laws in mhd turbulence that stem from conservation of @xmath58 and @xmath61 @xcite , as mentioned before . as a result , the phenomenological formulation in eq .",
    "( [ hr ] ) seems the most plausible .",
    "if we now assume that @xmath200 scales as the total energy , i.e. @xmath201 , then eq .",
    "( [ hr ] ) yields @xmath202 .",
    "however , it should be noted that the spectrum of cross - helicity in mhd turbulence may be steeper than ik , as , e.g. , @xmath203 , a spectral law which was obtained in two - point closures @xcite . in this case",
    "the spectrum leads to @xmath204 . for @xmath205 ,",
    "we find @xmath206 which does not allow us to decide between the two solutions",
    ". moreover , note that the correlation coefficient is very low in this computation , of the order of @xmath207 , with a spectrum strongly fluctuating with wavenumber .",
    "these simple arguments indicate that there may be in fact dynamical constraints on the behavior of the flow that link the velocity and magnetic field statistics , both for the energy and the helicity , and that go beyond a strict derivation of scaling laws in turbulence based on the conservation of a sole invariant , e.g. , the magnetic helicity or the total energy .",
    "in this paper we presented results from numerical simulations of mhd turbulence in the absence of external forcing , using a lagrangian averaged model to attain the largest possible reynolds number at a given spatial resolution . at very high reynolds number ,",
    "the separation of scales between the energy - containing range and the dissipation range is huge and , with a power - law decrease of the distribution of energy among scales , for all practical purposes the large - scale magnetic field acts as a locally uniform field for the small scales ; with one important difference though : that there is no imposed direction to the flow and that it is in fact isotropic at large scales ( no @xmath208 component ) . in other words , we can say that we have global isotropy and homogeneity .",
    "this is the case in the solar wind at very large scale : the locally uniform field in one of the spiral arms , changes direction with the spiral arm , and globally can be viewed as isotropic .",
    "however , at small scale , the effect of the large - scale field is such that the dynamics is anisotropic , or more precisely , locally anisotropic .    as a result of the global isotropy in our run",
    ", the total energy spectrum develops an inertial range compatible with iroshnikov - kraichnan phenomenology , and other spectral quantities are consistent with this scaling .",
    "moreover , the small scales are seen to go through an alfvenization process that can be attributed to a local mean magnetic field .",
    "however , magnetic helicity presents a wide inertial range with a spectrum steeper than what usual phenomenological arguments predict .",
    "what then is governing the behavior of magnetic helicity ?",
    "in the inverse cascade range , a dimensional kolmogorov - like analysis leads to @xmath209 @xcite , and numerical data using the integro - differential mhd equations in the framework of the eddy - damped quasi - normal markovian ( edqnm ) closure does corroborate the existence of such a regime .",
    "one should note that the argument in @xcite pre - supposes the independence of the cascades that may take place in mhd turbulence , that of total energy to small scales , that of cross - helicity likely to small scales as well , and that of magnetic helicity to large scales . however , the equipartition relationships in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : equipar1 ] ) , ( [ eq : equipar2 ] ) , and ( [ eq : hm ] ) , link the different correlators that one can build on the physical variables in a much more intricate way .",
    "we do know already that there are other such complex relationships involving coupling of these quantities , namely the exact laws that stem from the conservation of @xmath58 , @xmath61 and @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "it is advocated in @xcite that , in the decay and the forced case , different dynamics may take place .",
    "it is true that for a steady - state inverse cascade to develop , separation of scales and forcing are in principle required , and the present simulation has initial conditions with most of the magnetic helicity concentrated at the largest scale in the box . at this point",
    ", it is therefore important to make a distinction between the behavior of magnetic helicity in its inverse cascade range , and its behavior in the direct cascade range of energy as observed in our simulation . in the direct cascade range",
    ", helicity seems to be transported to smaller scales by the energy cascade , and its spectrum can be explained from phenomenological arguments that take into account alfvnization of the flow , or equivalently , the dynamics of magnetic field induction leading to alfvnization",
    ".    these arguments are however dependent on the spectrum of the kinetic and magnetic energy separately , on the spectrum of kinetic helicity @xmath210 , and on the spectrum of @xmath61 .",
    "indeed , the exact relationship for magnetic helicity derived in @xcite is more complex in its structure than the laws for the other invariants ; it involves the fields themselves , not structure functions ( based on field differences ) .",
    "moreover , the electromotive force @xmath211 ( associated with the magnetic induction ) plays a central role ( the law in @xcite derives only from the induction equation ) .",
    "furthermore , the third - order correlators of third - order tensors involving pseudo - vectors have a much more complex structure than for the full symmetric ( non - helical ) case , since it requires _ a priori _ four scaling functions to define the properties of the dynamics . other examples where the presence of helicity leads to new scaling laws are known @xcite .",
    "thus , we can expect , in a similar fashion , that there could be different forms of the magnetic helicity spectrum in mhd depending on , e.g. , the kinetic helicity or the intensity of the cross - helicity in the flow .",
    "the door to a lack of universality for spectra of invariants ( see also @xcite ) , since different regimes may occur in different mhd flows .",
    "note that these arguments differ from the critical balance regime for mhd turbulence advocated in @xcite and which does not seem to be observed in high reynolds number mhd , at least in the globally isotropic and decaying case ( see @xcite , and fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] ) . in spite of the different possible scaling laws arising for magnetic helicity , it would be interesting to know if all satisfy the condition given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : hm ] ) .",
    "we know of at least a few more examples satisfying this condition , e.g. , the flow in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the flows studied in the pioneering work of mller and malapaka @xcite .    finally , and as mentioned in the introduction , one other peculiarity of mhd turbulence is the fact that interactions are less local than in hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "this has been known for a long time in its simplest version , that of alfvn waves .",
    "the large - scale magnetic field is responsible for the propagation of waves that put in equipartition the small - scale velocity and magnetic fields ; this is the basis for the modification to a kolmogorov energy spectrum as proposed in @xcite .",
    "in fact , non - local effects have been quantified in mhd turbulence ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "nonlocality may also break down the underlying hypothesis leading to @xmath209 even for the inverse cascade range , and may intermingle small - scale velocity and magnetic excitations with the large - scale magnetic field . as stressed in @xcite , nonlocality breaks the simple self - similarity known to occur in fluids at least at second order ; it is also shown in @xcite that the magnetic field at small scale may have a folded structure that is consistent with the exact law derived in @xcite .",
    "thus , the exact mhd laws , and their associated balances presented here , which are derived independently of locality assumptions , may therefore prove useful to reach a better understanding of mhd turbulence .",
