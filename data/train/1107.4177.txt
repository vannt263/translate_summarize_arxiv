    "the sfe of ngc 2264 is estimated to be 11% from the stellar mass of the ob and t - tauri type stars of @xmath63 ( @xcite ) and the molecular gas mass traced in the nh@xmath0 line of @xmath64 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the sfe of ngc 1333 is estimated to be 16% from the stellar mass of the t - tauri type stars of @xmath65 ( @xcite ) and the molecular gas mass traced in the nh@xmath0 line of @xmath66 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the sfe of l1228 is estimated to be 8% from the stellar mass of the t - tauri type stars of @xmath67 ( @xcite ) and the molecular gas mass traced in the nh@xmath0 line of @xmath68 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the sfe of subclump - a1 is close to @xmath3 42% estimated at ngc 2024 and ngc 2068 from the cs observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the derived sfes of individual clumps are summarized in table [ tab:3 ] .",
    "the values of `` total '' in table [ tab:3 ] correspond to the upper limits of the sfes for the case in which the all 2mass sources we found are associated with the clump or the subclump .      although clump - a and clump - b are adjacent on the sky , there is a big difference in the star formation activities .",
    "because these clumps are close to ngc 7000 , the difference may be due to the h region .",
    "therefore , we discuss the geometry of the clumps and the h region .",
    "the optical image ( figure [ fig:1 ] ) shows that the clumps are located in the foreground of the h region .",
    "subclump - a1 is the nearest to and clump - b is the farthest from the h region on the sky .    to investigate the three - dimensional structure of clump - a , we estimated the length along the line of sight , @xmath69 , derived as @xmath70 , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the hydrogen column density and the critical density in the nh@xmath0 line , respectively .",
    "when we use @xmath73 10@xmath74 @xmath75 @xcite , the lengths of subclump - a1 , a2 , and a3 are estimated to be @xmath76 0.8 , 0.6 , and 0.6 pc , respectively . these values are 23 times longer than the sizes on the sky .",
    "the three subclumps may be the end - on view of the elephant trunks observed in m16 .    as seen in subsection 3.2 , clump - a and clump - b",
    "are spatially separated .",
    "this suggests that these two clumps are gravitationally unbound .",
    "the total lte mass of the two clumps is 547 .",
    "if the two clumps are gravitationally bound , the enclosed mass is estimated to be 11000 from their separation of 2.9 pc and relative velocity of 4 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the lte mass is @xmath77 1/20 of the enclosed mass .",
    "the mass of the cloud around the two clumps traced in the @xmath5co line is estimated to be @xmath78 from the column density of @xmath79 @xmath35 @xcite . both the total mass of the two clumps and the @xmath5co cloud is smaller than the enclosed mass . therefore , clump - a and clump - b are gravitationally unbound .",
    "however , clump - a , clump - b , and other weak features between the clumps are aligned on the position - velocity diagram ( figure [ fig:5 ] ) .",
    "this suggests that they are also aligned in the three - dimensional structure .",
    "we compare the lsr velocities of the h region and the molecular gas .",
    "figure [ fig:12](a ) shows the lsr velocity map of the h emission @xcite superimposed on the @xmath5co integrated intensity map @xcite and the nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) integrated intensity map .",
    "the lsr velocity of the h emission line is approximately 0 km s@xmath2 at the position overlapped with the nh@xmath0 clumps , and 45 km s@xmath2 on both the eastern and the western sides of the nh@xmath0 clumps .",
    "the lsr velocities of clump - a and clump - b are 5.5 and 1.5 km s@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "clump - a is redshifted with respect to the h region .",
    "we show the fwhm map of the h emission @xcite in figure [ fig:12](b ) .",
    "the fwhm of the h emission around the nh@xmath0 clumps is 1020 km s@xmath2 .",
    "this value is narrower than the fwhm at the other position .",
    "these characteristics can be interpreted as indicating that the redshifted component of the h emission is blocked by clump - a , and only ionized gas located in the foreground of clump - a would be observed .",
    "therefore , clump - a would be surrounded by the ionized gas .    in clump - b , the h emission is not detected .",
    "this indicates that there is no ionized gas at the foreground of clump - b .",
    "however , we found the presence of ionized gas in the background of clump - b , because a radio continuum emission at 4.8 ghz is detected there @xcite . therefore , clump - b would be located in the foreground of the h region .",
    "we show the schematic geometry of the nh@xmath0 clumps and the h region in figure [ fig:13 ] .      in subsection [ sec:4.2 ]",
    ", we show that the sfe @xmath3 3662% of subclump - a1 is higher than that of other molecular clouds . here",
    ", we examine why this is so .",
    "there is no difference in the physical condition of the molecular gas in clump - a and clump - b .",
    "the kinetic temperature and the velocity width of clump - a are similar to those of clump - b .",
    "the main difference between them appears to be the geometry to the h region .",
    "the geometry shown in the previous subsection suggests that subclump - a1 is closer to the h region than any of the other subclumps or clump - b .",
    "the five t - tauri stars in subclump - a1 would be formed by the interaction of the h region with the molecular gas .",
    "a high sfe is observed in other triggered star forming regions .",
    "the ngc 2024 and 2068 molecular clouds , each of which interact with an h region ( @xcite ) , show sfe @xmath80% ( @xcite ) .",
    "this means that the sfe of subclump - a1 increases because of the effect of the h region .",
    "theoretical calculations suggest that the sfe is in the range of 3050% of the regions that form clusters of low - mass stars @xcite .",
    "the estimated sfe of subclump - a1 is very close to this value .",
    "@xcite suggest that the sfe of the clumps that are more massive than approximately 3000 , in which o stars will form , is lower than 3050% because of the destructive effects of massive stars .",
    "the sfe may be increased in a cloud with the formation of a low - mass star cluster .",
    "we consider whether other subclumps and clump - b are kept the low sfe .",
    "star formation appears to advance sequentially in the order of a1 , a2 , a3 , and b. this order is the same as that of the distance from the h region .",
    "it is suggested that the triggered star formation or the interstellar shock comes sequentially from the h region .",
    "a molecular shell with an expansion velocity of @xmath81 km s@xmath2 is found in the @xmath6co line @xcite . in the case",
    "that the effect of the h region expands at this velocity , the crossing timescale from subclump - a1 to clump - b is estimated to be @xmath82 yr using their separation of 2.9 pc .",
    "this timescale is shorter than the lifetime of the o5 v type star ( 2 @xmath11 10@xmath83 yr ; @xcite ) , which is considered to be the ionizing star of the h region @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the h region can affect clump - b in the future , in the case that the separation in the line of sight is the same order of magnitude as that on the sky .",
    "the total molecular gas mass of clump - a and clump - b is 391 .",
    "this mass is close to that of ngc 2024 or ngc 2068 @xcite , and it is small enough to avoid cloud destruction by new born stars @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the sfe of the combined clump - a and b can be as high as approximately 40% .",
    "the observed sfe is sensitive to the estimation of both gas and stellar masses .",
    "as mentioned in subsection [ sec:3.2 ] , we estimated the actual gas mass within a factor of 23 .",
    "however , it is generally difficult to estimate the molecular gas mass .",
    "the estimated molecular gas mass is sometimes different by more than a factor of 10 in different observed lines . in the w3 giant molecular cloud ,",
    "the molecular gas mass estimated in the @xmath6co ( @xmath7=1 - 0 ) , c@xmath84o ( @xmath7=2 - 1 ) , and nh@xmath0 lines is 16000 , 1400 , and 3300 , respectively @xcite , although they were estimated in the same area . for the estimation of sfe",
    ", the @xmath6co line data are often used to estimate the molecular gas mass ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . because the @xmath6co line traces the less dense gas ,",
    "the molecular gas mass might be overestimated . however , the data of the molecular line to trace the dense gas is not ideal to estimate the molecular gas mass , because the relative abundance is difficult to determine precisely .",
    "for example , the abundance of nh@xmath0 varies by up to a factor of 10 from cloud to cloud .",
    "it is also difficult to estimate the stellar mass accurately .",
    "there are few studies based on total stellar mass estimated as the sum of the masses of individual stars .",
    "although the infrared luminosity is often used to estimate the stellar mass , it would be less accurate than the mass estimated based on the number count of the t - tauri type stars shown in this paper .",
    "as mentioned above , the observed sfe reported in some studies should be revised by an order of magnitude .",
    "the sfes of the nearby molecular clouds such as perseus and ophiuchus , l1551 in taurus , and giant molecular clouds in the inner galaxy are 36% , 915% , and 2% , respectively ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these values may be underestimated , because these studies use the molecular gas mass estimated from the @xmath46 and co maps .",
    "we should take care how to estimate the sfe to refer it from the previous studies .",
    "previous surveys of h@xmath1o masers have been carried out based on the iras point source catalogue ( psc ) .",
    "this catalogue is useful for searching for ysos embedded in the molecular clouds .",
    "however , the counterpart of the h@xmath1o maser that we found in subclump - a2 is not catalogued .",
    "it shows that the h@xmath1o survey based on the iras psc is insufficient .",
    "there are two possibilities why some ysos are uncatalogued in the iras psc : sensitivity too poor to detect them or resolution too poor to resolve a cluster of some sources .",
    "figure [ fig:14 ] shows an iras image at 100 @xmath54 m overlayed on our nh@xmath0 map .",
    "a complex source is found near clump - a in the iras image , although it is composed of several infrared sources in the @xmath53 image ( see figure [ fig:10 ] ) .",
    "this suggests that there are many h@xmath1o maser sources which are not catalogued in the iras psc .",
    "a new h@xmath1o maser survey should be carried out based on a point source catalogue with a higher resolution and sensitivity , such asq @xmath53 and/or akari should be carried out .",
    "our new h@xmath1o maser is associated with a far - infrared source , and its luminosity is brighter than that of the mid - infrared .",
    "this characteristic may be a good criterion with which to find new h@xmath1o maser sources .",
    "we observed ngc 7000 in the nh@xmath0 line and h@xmath1o maser using the kashima 34-m telescope .",
    "our observations are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we found two major clumps with a mass of 95452 , and three subclumps with a mass of 920 .",
    "the molecular gas in these show similar gas kinetic temperatures of 1115 k and line width of 12 km s@xmath2 .",
    "however , they show different star formation activities such as the concentration of t - tauri type stars and the association of an h@xmath1o maser .",
    "2 .   one of the clumps that is associated with a cluster of t - tauri type stars shows the sfe @xmath3 3662% . this sfe is higher than that of the other clumps .",
    "a comparison of the distribution of molecular gas and ionized gas traced by the h@xmath17 emission suggests that the clump with high sfe is located near the h region .",
    "therefore , the high sfe would be related to the interaction of molecular gas and the h region .",
    "4 .   we found a new h@xmath1o maser source in the nh@xmath0 clump .",
    "although the counterpart of this maser is not found in the iras point source catalogue , we found it in the @xmath53 24- and 70-@xmath54 m images .",
    "this suggests that a new h@xmath1o maser survey should be carried out based on the point source catalogue of @xmath53 and/or akari .",
