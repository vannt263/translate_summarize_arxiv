    "the theoretical study of matter under extreme conditions enjoys a wide range of application , from the physics of the early universe , to that of relativistic nuclear collisions .",
    "the latter offer the tantalizing possibility of recreating in the laboratory the conditions that prevailed roughly a microsecond after the big bang .",
    "the theory of the strong interaction , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , predicts a phase transition from normal hadronic matter to a plasma of quarks and gluons @xcite . to find a signature of this new state of matter represents a task which has generated tremendous activity both in theory and in experiment . of the many signals put forward as probes of the quark - gluon plasma ,",
    "the suppression of the @xmath1 yield enjoys a popular status @xcite .    indeed , since charmonium is predominantly produced in the early stage of the nuclear collisions through hard processes , it acts as a probe for the subsequent stages .",
    "the original idea was that the presence of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) will screen the long - range confining force between @xmath2-@xmath3 , leading to the decoherence of the pair @xcite .",
    "this suppression mechanism was later augmented by the possibility of charmonium dissociation by hard gluons in a deconfined medium @xcite .",
    "but , in order to identify the true nature of a possibly new phase , it appears necessary to quantify the @xmath1-light hadron interaction .",
    "this requirement on the @xmath1 cross - sections with light mesons is not a trivial one to satisfy , as there are no direct experimental measurements .",
    "one has to rely on theoretical calculations based , for example , on qcd sum - rules @xcite , on quark - potential models @xcite , on extented nambu and jona - lasinio models @xcite , or on effective @xmath4 mesonic lagrangians @xcite .",
    "these lead typically to cross - sections from a few tenths of a millibarn to a few millibarns near threshold @xcite .    specifically , for the effective mesonic lagrangians found in refs  , once form factors have been folded - in to account for short - range interactions , the dissociation cross - section by pions reaches a few millibarns .",
    "but concerns have been raised about using such models : ( i ) the @xmath4 symmetry used to describe the pseudoscalar and vector meson interactions is questionable as it is broken , ( ii ) the form factors accounting for the finite size of the mesons do not proceed from the formalism as in other models @xcite , and ( iii ) the @xmath5 process does not vanish in the soft - pion limit for non - degenerate vector meson masses as expected from adler s theorem @xcite . in this contribution we will outline the consequence of implementing the soft - pion theorem ( i.e. , adler s theorem ) on the dissociation cross - section of @xmath5 by constructing a lagrangian invariant under the global @xmath6 symmetry group .",
    "a spontaneously broken symmetry not only implies the existence of goldstone bosons , but also constrains their low - energy behaviour . here",
    "we will consider the transition amplitude for emitting one goldstone boson ( the proof can easily be extended to more than one ) .",
    "following weinberg @xcite , we first note that the current operator can create a goldstone boson @xmath7 where f is the decay constant .",
    "we expect the matrix element @xmath8 to then have a pole term .",
    "indeed , in general , we can write @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the desired transition amplitude for emitting one goldstone boson , and @xmath11 is assumed to be the pole - free contribution . applying the current conservation constraint",
    ", we then find that @xmath12 and we see that as @xmath13 the rhs vanishes . historically , this property was first studied by adler @xcite , and rests on the assumption that @xmath14 has no singularity as @xmath15 .",
    "this is not valid in general , since a pole may arise through the insertion of the current operator on an external line @xcite .",
    "@xmath10 can then have a non - vanishing contribution in the soft limit due to emission of a soft goldstone boson off an external line .",
    "but for chiral - symmetric and normal - parity mesonic lagrangians such an insertion is impossible and we expect the theorem to hold .",
    "we will now explicitly check that decoupling occurs for the process @xmath16 in two chiral - invariant lagrangians .",
    "we first build the effective chiral lagrangian as in ref .",
    "yielding @xmath20 -\\frac{1}{4}{\\rm tr}\\left[f^v_{\\mu\\nu } f^{\\mu\\nu}_v +   f^a_{\\mu\\nu}f^{\\mu\\nu}_a \\right ] \\nonumber   \\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{2}m_v^2{\\rm tr}\\left[v_\\mu^2\\right ] + \\frac{1}{2}m_a^2{\\rm tr}\\left[a_\\mu^2\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\mathcal{l}_{v\\phi\\phi } + \\mathcal{l}_{av\\phi } + \\mathcal{l}_{vv\\phi\\phi } + \\cdots\\ , , \\label{lvap}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the pseudo - scalar field , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the field strength tensors for the vector and axial vector mesons respectively .",
    "the model has three parameters , namely the pion decay constant , @xmath24 , the vector mass , @xmath25 , and the universal coupling constant , @xmath26 .",
    "the axial vector meson mass is related to the vector mass in this model and thus is not an input parameter .",
    "it is then seen that the process under consideration , namely @xmath27 , involves 5 tree - level diagrams for the given particle content : @xmath28- and @xmath29-mediated exchanges both in @xmath30 and @xmath31 channels , and through a 4-point interaction ( fig  [ fig1 ] ) .    .",

    "having now the full amplitude for the given process , we wish to see if the pseudoscalar decoupling theorem holds .",
    "the presence of the contact term in the 4-point interaction leads us to expect cancellations to occur as we let one of the pions 4-momentum go to zero",
    ". stated differently , since the @xmath37-meson was introduced in a chirally symmetric way by adding its chiral partner ( i.e. @xmath29 ) , the transition amplitude relies on help from the @xmath29 in what amounts to a delicate cancellation allowing the pion to decouple . to show this",
    ", we contract the amplitudes with the appropriate polarization vectors , and then let @xmath38 ( a similar proof can be shown to hold for @xmath39 ) .",
    "first it is seen that the amplitudes involving the @xmath28-exchange go to zero because of transversality ( i.e @xmath40 ) .",

    "finally , the 4-point interaction reads @xmath42 and thus the _ full amplitude _ is shown to vanish as expected .",
    "note the cancellation between the 4-point interaction and the @xmath29 channels . in summary , even though the pions are not coupled through gradient coupling for all interaction terms , the net amplitude still vanishes due to intricate cancellations amongst all the channels .      in the previous section",
    "the axial mesons were introduced as the chiral partners of the @xmath37 fields resulting in a linear realization of the symmetry @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "since the desired chiral lagrangian will involve only pseudoscalar and vector mesons , both will then have to transform non - linearly under the symmetry .",

    "the two amplitudes are then @xmath56 we immediately see that the soft pion theorem holds separately for each amplitude when the proper polarization vectors are contracted with the amplitudes .",
    "we first start by noting that all the effective lagrangian models found in the literature @xcite are invariant under @xmath58 ( in the degenerate mass limit ) , but not under the extended chriral symmetry , i.e. , @xmath6 , and therefore we expect the pions will not decouple in soft - momentum limit .",
    "specifically , here we will compare the @xmath5 cross - section as calculated within the @xmath58only models found in refs   and with the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ lvp1 ] ) extended to the @xmath59 symmetry group . for the @xmath58 models ,",
    "three diagrams need to be considered ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , while for the extended chiral model proposed here , the contact interaction is absent .",
    "it can be explicitly shown that the pseudoscalars decouple in the soft momentum limit for that latter case @xcite .    .",
    "]    the differential isospin - averaged cross - section is given by @xmath60\\left[g_{\\nu\\beta}-\\frac{q_{1\\nu}q_{1\\beta } } { m^2_{j/\\psi}}\\right],\\ ] ] where the appropriate model - dependent squared amplitude is used , an isospin factor of two has been included and the centre of mass momentum is @xmath61 and the triangle function is @xmath62 .",
    "integrating over the kinematical range defined by @xmath63 gives the total cross - section .",
    "fixing the relevant parameters @xcite and carrying this to completion for the two models yields fig .",
    "we see an energy - dependent reduction in the cross sections across the relevant domain and to quote a specific number we note that at @xmath64 gev the cross - section is reduced by about 40% going from the @xmath58 model to the @xmath6 model .    .",
    "modeling low - energy hadron physics is particularly challenging when there is limited experimental input available for constraints . this is the current situation in the charm sector as the only measurement relevant for fixing coupling constants in the model is the decay width for @xmath65  @xcite .",
    "we have therefore invoked symmetries and general theorems . in particular ,",
    "we have checked for full @xmath66 symmetry and the appropriate limit to test for compliance with adler s theorem .",
    "we found that none of the published models can do this , and we therefore proposed a new effective lagrangian  the first one which does encode complete four - flavour chiral symmetry and adler s theorem .",
    "our interest here has been solely to quantify the effect of these . a complete calculation including form factors and a longer list of reactions is a topic for a separate study .",
    "since adler s theorem is relevant at low - energy , the near - threshold cross sections are expected to be affected the most .",
    "we found the cross section for @xmath67 to be reduced as compared to a choice of lagrangian which does not encode the full flavour chiral symmetry and does not obey adler s theorem .",
    "the reduction is energy dependent , but seems to be a few tens of percents from threshold to @xmath68 = 5 gev . in a full calculation",
    "the size of this reduction might not persist when one takes into account not only form factors , but also abnormal parity interactions and symmetry breaking effects ( e.g. pseudoscalar masses and non - degenerate vector mass spectrum ) .",
    "abnormal parity interactions may play an important role near threshold .",
    "indeed , it was shown that adler s theorem breaks down if a soft goldstone boson can be inserted on an external line .",
    "this is expected to happen for abnormal parity lagrangians where a @xmath69 vertex exists .",
    "the abnormal parity contribution to the @xmath70 amplitude will then not vanish in the soft limit .",
    "the problem in including these interactions lies again in the lack of experimental data to fix the coupling strengths .",
    "symmetry breaking effects are also expected to be important since the underlying @xmath71 is broken",
    ".    it will also be important in the future to take this formalism to completion by implementing covariant hadronic form factors computed within the same effective lagrangian or perhaps other approaches . ultimately , the outlook for this line of study is to estimate the dissociation cross sections with all the light hadrons , with finite size effects incorporated , and then to input the results into a dynamical model for heavy ion reactions to finally address the question of @xmath1 survivability in the hadronic phase ( primarily mesonic matter ) .",
    "for then , one would have a more complete understanding of the @xmath1 yield and therefore know what it implies about qgp formation .",
