    "now all these data can not be described within the one - nucleon exchange model ( one ) including even the relativistic effects in the deuteron @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the elastic backward proton - deuteron scattering within the relativistic approach including the one and the high order graphs corresponding to the emission , rescattering and absorption of the virtual pion by a deuteron nucleon .",
    "the studies of the elastic backward proton - deuteron scattering within the nonrelativistic one and the relativistic invariant one - nucleon exchange model ( rone ) are presented in ref.@xcite and ref.@xcite respectively .",
    "the differential cross section calculated within the rone ( fig.1a ) can be presented in the following form @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the deuteron wave function ; @xmath5 is the square of the initial energy in the @xmath6 c.m.s . , @xmath7 is the square of momentum transfer from initial deuteron to final proton ; @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the four - momenta of neutron and proton in the deuteron , @xmath11 is the nucleon mass . unfortunately , the one and the rone do not allow a satisfactory description of all the observables at the kinetic energy of backward scattered protons @xmath12",
    "gev @xcite .",
    "as was shown in ref.@xcite , the contribution of the high - order graphs in the @xmath6 backward elastic scattering corresponding to the emission , rescattering and absorption of the virtual pion by a deuteron nucleon can be sizable at initial energies corresponding to possible creation of the @xmath13-isobar at the @xmath14 vertex , see fig.1c .",
    "the corrections to the one graph of fig.1a were also analyzed in other papers , see for example ref.@xcite and references therein . as was shown in refs.@xcite the contribution of the one - pion exhange graphs to the deuetron stripping reaction of type @xmath15 can be also sizable at the initial energies close to a possible @xmath13-isobar creation in the intermediate state .",
    "we calculated the center - of - mass differential cross section , the tensor analyzing power of the deuteron @xmath16 and the transfer polarization @xmath17 in the elastic backward @xmath6 squattering including the rone graph ( fig.1a ) and the graphs of fig.1c .",
    "these results are presented in figs.(2,3 ) . in figs.(2,3 )",
    "curves @xmath18 and @xmath19 correspond to the total calculation and the rone computation using the reid soft core deuteron wave function , whereas the lines @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the same calculations but for the argon-18 @xmath22 potential .",
    "as is evident from figs.(2,3 ) the rone allows us to describe @xmath23 and @xmath16 at initial deuteron momenta up to  @xmath24 , whereas the transfer polarization @xmath17 is not described within the rone in the wide interval of deuteron momenta @xmath25 .",
    "figures.(2,3 ) show that the total calculation of all the observables including the graphs of fig.1a and fig.1c results in a rather satisfactory description of the experimental data .",
    "the graphs of fig.1c were calculated using the monopole form factor for the virtual pion with the cut - off parameter about @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath14 amplitude entering into the @xmath14 vertex of the fig.1c graph was taken from the @xmath14 phase shift analysis .",
    "one can conclude that the calculation of all the observables for the elastic backward @xmath6 scattering within the relativistic invariant approach including the rone graphs and the one - pion exchange graphs of fig.1c type results in a rather satisfactory description of the experimental data at initial deuteron momenta up to @xmath27 .",
    "note that we do not include the six - quark admixture in the deuteron wave function .",
    "this effect can probably be important at larger initial momenta because the contribution of the fig.1c graphs decreases when @xmath28 increases , as is shown in fig.2 .",

    "+  at least , the discussed effects in the elastic backward proton - deuteron scattering decrease at initial deuteron momenta above @xmath30 and they can be neglected , as is evident from fig.2 . as for the deuteron stripping reactions on nuclei , probably the contribution of discussed triangle graphs can be also neglected at high initial energies .",

    "the sensitivity of all the results to the value of the cut - off parameter entering into the form factor is about 10 - 20 percent .",
    "the results presented in the slides correspond to the cut - off parameter about @xmath31 . _ question . _",
    "* + why your old results on @xmath16 in the deuteron stripping reaction on a proton including similar one - pion exchange graphs did not describe the experimental data at large internal deuteron momenta ?",
    "on the other hand , your new calculations of @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the elastic backward proton - deuteron scattering allow a rather satisfactory description of the experimental data in the whole kinematic region .",
    "+ _ reply .",
    "_ * g.i.lykasov . * + it is due to the following . in our old calculations",
    "we did not include the interference between different graphs , we summed the squares of separate graphs .",
    "however , the inclusion of the interference terms is very important .",
    "now we include the interference terms because we take the pion - nucleon scattering amplitude entering into the @xmath14 vertex of the graph in fig.1c from the @xmath14 phase shift analysis and can calculate both the real part and the imaginary part of the matrix element corresponding to any graph of fig.1c ."
