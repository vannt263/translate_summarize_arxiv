    "computing the charateristic numbers of curves in projective spaces is a classical problem in algebraic geometry : how many curves in @xmath0 of given degree and genus that pass through a general set of linear subspaces , and are tangent to a general set of hyperplanes ?",
    "these types of problems have provided a wealth of inspiration for classical algebraic geometers , such as schubert , zenthen , mailard , and have been one of the main drives of the development of intersection theory .",
    "they have achieved remarkable success despite the technology of their time ( in mathematical and literal sense ) .",
    "for example , schubert has correctly computed the number of twisted cubics in @xmath1 that are tangent to @xmath2 quadric surfaces ( @xmath3 ) , and this represents the summit of enumerative geometry at the time ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , not until recently are characteristic numbers computed in certain generality , as all of the results obtained by classical algebraic geometers are bounded by degree .",
    "moduli space of stable maps provide a powerful tools to attack characteristic numbers problems of curves with low genus .",
    "the case of rational space curve of any degree was solved in @xcite .",
    "the author actually gave algorithms to compute intersections of divisors on @xmath4 and derived characteristic numbers as a corollary .",
    "however , if one is only interested in the characteristic numbers , then a small tweak would give a much faster and easier to implement algorithm .",
    "the case of elliptic plane curves , any degree , was solve in @xcite .",
    "the difficulty to extend that result to @xmath5 was due to two factors .",
    "firstly , there was yet a result calculating incidence - only ( no tangency ) numbers for elliptic space curves in any dimensional projective space . secondly , because the tangency divisor on @xmath6 is related to the divisor of elliptic curves with fixed @xmath7-invariant , hence one also needs to compute the characteristic numbers of elliptic curves with fixed @xmath7-invariant .",
    "the latter was solved in a separate paper by the author ( @xcite ) .",
    "the algorithms for characteristic numbers of genus two plane curves were given in @xcite , although no actual numbers were shown .",
    "in this paper , we solve the full characteristic numbers problem for elliptic curves in projective spaces by using the moduli space of stable maps .",
    "note that , even in the incidence - only case our result is already new .",
    "for example , no incidence - only characteristic numbers for elliptic curves in @xmath8 and @xmath9 have been computed .",
    "the number of elliptic curves in @xmath1 were computed in @xcite and the proof was scheduled to appear in another paper . however , the author of this paper was unable to locate it .",
    "the incidence - only numbers of elliptic curves in @xmath1 were also computed in @xcite . in that paper , only the numbers upto degree @xmath10 elliptic curves were computed , but the method could compute numbers of any degree .",
    "the incidence - only numbers of degree @xmath10 elliptic curves in @xmath1 were first computed in @xcite using a classical argument .",
    "the approach of this paper is as follows .",
    "we first compute incidence - only numbers for elliptic space curves using getzler relation .",
    "this is analogous to the enumeration of rational space curves using wdvv equation , but with a small twist . first we will not be using the entire moduli space of stable maps @xmath11 as intersecting enumerative classes with the virtual fundamental class will have unwanted contributions from other components ( this space is not irreducible ) .",
    "in fact , it was claimed in @xcite that the actual count of elliptic curves is a linear combination of genus one and genus zero gromov - witten invariants .",
    "we will only use the main component , that is the closure of the locus of maps with smooth source curves , denoted by @xmath12 . for our purpose ,",
    "knowledge of the maps on the loci where the main component intersect other components is required , and this is desribed in section @xmath10 .    in the case of rational curve ,",
    "the wdvv equation is a rational equivalence of divisors , hence we can pull back via the forgetful morphism and obtain a relation on the stable map space .",
    "this is no longer true for the genus one stable map space .",
    "the reason is that getzler relation is a rational equivalence of codimension @xmath13 strata on @xmath14 , and that the forgetful morphism @xmath15 have fibre dimensions that could jump : for example , the preimage of the stratum @xmath16 , has two components , one of which is of codimension @xmath13 , and the other is a weil divisor .",
    "we can get around this as follows .",
    "first we use enough enumerative constraints to cut down the space @xmath17 into a @xmath13-dimensional family .",
    "then we pushforward via the forgetful morphism , and then intersect with getzler s relation . as a result",
    "we obtain a relation of the enumerative invariants of elliptic curves with that of rational curves , rational cuspidal curves , and elliptic curves with fixed @xmath7 invariants .",
    "the first is well - known , and the latter two were computed in @xcite and @xcite respectively .    to go from incidence - only to full characteristic numbers , we study the relation between the tangency divisor and the incident and boundary divisors .",
    "we will not obtain a rational equivalence , due to the present of enumeratively irrelevant divisors , those that are intersections of @xmath17 with other components .",
    "however , we obtain a numerical equivalence whenever we intersect with only curves in @xmath17 that has empty intersection with the irrelevant divisors .",
    "this is true for @xmath18-dimensional families of elliptic curves cut down by enumerative constraints , so this is enough for our purpose .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section @xmath13",
    ", we introduce basic notions such as various stacks of stable maps and the enumerative constraints . in section",
    "@xmath19 we review getzler s relation and give an example of using the relation to count elliptic curves . in section @xmath10 , we give the recusion computing incidence - only numbers of elliptic space curves based on getzler s relation . in section @xmath20",
    ", we give the recursions computing full characteristic numbers of elliptic space curves .",
    "we end with some tables with numerical examples in section @xmath21 .",
    "the author would like to thank ravi vakil for many helpful suggestions and some of the arguments used in this paper , and for suggisting this problem .",
    "we denote @xmath4 the kontsevich compactification of the moduli space of genus zero curves with @xmath22 marked points of degree @xmath23 in @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath17 be the main component of the moduli space of stable maps of genus one , that is , the closure of the locus of maps with smooth domains .",
    "we will also use the notation @xmath24 and @xmath25 where the markings are indexed by a set @xmath26 .",
    "we will be concerned with the number of curves passing through a constraint , and each constraint is denoted by a @xmath27-tuple @xmath28 as follows : + * ( i ) * @xmath29 is the number of hyperplanes that the curves need to be tangent to .",
    "+ * ( ii ) * for @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the number of subspaces of codimension @xmath32 that the curves need to pass through .    in @xcite and @xcite , the constraints may have @xmath33 coordinates because we want to impose conditions on the node or cusp , but we will not need that here .    note that because in general a curve of degree @xmath23 will always intersect a hyperplane at @xmath23 points , introducing an incident condition with a hyperplane has the same effect as that of multiplying the enumerative number by @xmath23 .",
    "for example , if we ask how many genus zero curves of degree @xmath10 in @xmath1 that pass through the constraint @xmath34 , that means we ask how many genus zero curves of degree @xmath10 pass through three lines , four points , are tangent to one hyperplane , and then multiply that answer by @xmath35 .",
    "we will also refer to @xmath28 as a set of linear spaces , hence we can say , pick a space @xmath36 in @xmath28 .",
    "we consider the following ordering on the set of constraints , in order to prove that our algorithm will terminate later on .",
    "let @xmath37\\cdot i^2 $ ] , and this will be our rank function .",
    "we compare two constraints @xmath38 using the following criteria , whose priority are in the following order .",
    "we only proceed to using the next criterion if using the current one give us a tie .    * if @xmath39 then @xmath40 . * if @xmath41 and @xmath28 has fewer non - hyperplane elements than @xmath42 does , then @xmath43 . *",

    "the contribution is @xmath205 we can permute the marked points on each component and permute the two component themshelves , hence the factor @xmath196 . the factors @xmath201 comes from the fact that we can permute two branches over one of the node of the image for maps in @xmath206    except the terms involving @xmath60 , all other terms can be computed either from algorithms in @xcite and @xcite or recursively . for example @xmath207",

    "_ the loci of maps that contract an elliptic component are at most divisors on @xmath61 .",
