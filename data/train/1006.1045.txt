    "because of deflections in the interstellar and intergalactic magnetic fields , the information about the original directions of cosmic rays pointing to their production sites is lost . on the other hand ,",
    "the isotropic flux of cosmic rays is contributed , most likely , by a large number of galactic and extragalactic sources .",
    "these objects represent different source populations characterized by essentially different physical parameters  age , distance , energy budget , etc . , as well as by different particle acceleration scenarios .",
    "this makes extremely difficult the identification of sources of cosmic rays based on the chemical composition and energy spectra of particles - two measurables characterizing the `` soup '' ( isotropic flux of cosmic rays ) cooked over cosmological timescales .",
    "fortunately , at extremely high energies , @xmath0 ev , the impact of galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields on the propagation of cosmic rays becomes less dramatic , which might result in large and small scale anisotropies of cosmic ray fluxes .",
    "thus , depending on the strength and structure of the ( highly unknown ) intergalactic magnetic field ( igmf ) , the highest energy domain of cosmic rays may offer us a new astronomical discipline - `` cosmic ray astronomy '' .",
    "the extension of studies to energies @xmath1ev and beyond enhances the chances of localization of particle accelerators for two reasons . with an increase of particle energy , the probability that a proton would penetrate through the intergalactic medium ( igm ) without significant deflections in chaotic magnetic fields increases .",
    "note that for igmf much weaker than @xmath2 g , the deflection angle can be quite small also for lower energy protons ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "however at energies significantly below @xmath1 ev , the deflection in galactic magnetic fields becomes the dominant factor leading to the lost of information about the original directions of particles ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the context of prospects of realization of `` cosmic - ray astronomy '' , there is a second _ independent _ factor which gives strong preference to energies @xmath1 ev .",
    "particles of such high energies can arrive only from relatively nearby accelerators located within 100  mpc ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "this dramatically ( by orders of magnitude ) decreases the number of relevant sources of @xmath4ev protons contributing to the observed cosmic ray flux , and correspondingly reduces the level of the diffuse background , i.e. the ( quasi ) isotropic flux as a superposition of contributions by unresolved discrete sources .",
    "formally , one can not _ a priori _ exclude the possibility that the @xmath1 ev cosmic rays are contributed by a large number of weak sources which can not be detected individually .",
    "alternatively , the entire cosmic ray flux at such high energies can be dominated by contributions from a few sources , especially given the tough requirements to the @xmath1 ev proton accelerators  @xcite .",
    "this excludes , in particular , objects like ordinary galaxies , unless the galaxies provide highest energy cosmic rays through transient events related to compact objects like gamma ray bursts ( grb )  @xcite .",
    "the propagation of cosmic rays in igmf has been discussed in a number of recent works ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in these studies different magnetized environments have been assumed and different methods dealing with particle transport have be applied .",
    "consequently , their conclusions are quite different , the principal reason being the different assumptions and approaches in the modeling of the igmf .",
    "the main purpose of our work is the study of features related to the transport of particles , therefore we assume , following ref .",
    "@xcite , purely turbulent and homogeneous igmf .",
    "this not only makes the calculations simple and more transparent ( as long as it concerns the pure transport effects ) , but also seems to be a feasible realization for the large scale structure of igmf .",
    "whether we may identify the accelerators of extragalactic cosmic rays using the highest energy protons is a question which largely depends on the strength of the large scale igmf . even for the most favorable conditions for realization of the `` proton astronomy ''",
    ", the latter will be relevant to the nearby universe , the accessible sources being limited within a sphere of radius 100  mpc .",
    "a different approach for localization of acceleration cites of @xmath1 ev protons can be provided by observations of gamma - rays and neutrinos produced at interactions of these energetic particles with the 2.7 k cmbr photons and magnetic fields in the proximity of the source , namely within a region of a size of order of 10  mpc - sufficiently large for effective interaction of protons with 2.7 k photons through photomeson process and , at the same time , still small for a significant deflection of protons from their original directions .",
    "all short - lived particles of these interactions , as well as the products of their decays ( gamma - rays , neutrinos and electrons ) are produced at small angles relative to the initial directions of parent protons . in an magnetized environment with @xmath5",
    "g the electrons with typical energy exceeding @xmath6 ev are predominantly cooled via synchrotron radiation with production of high energy gamma - rays .",
    "the electrons emit synchrotron photons very quickly , before any significant change of their direction in the surrounding chaotic magnetic field .",
    "thus the synchrotron photons will move essentially in the initial direction of the parent protons . since the protons , after they escape their production site ( accelerator ) , move radially , the observer will see an apparent compact ( quasi - point like ) gamma - ray source @xcite , even though gamma - rays are produced in an extended region with angular size of order of @xmath7  deg .",
    "note that the same is true if protons escape the source anisotropically , but are moving within a narrow angular cone towards the observer .",
    "otherwise , the observer will miss the source .",
    "the favorable range of igmf for realization of this scenario is @xmath8  g. in a stronger magnetic field , deflections of protons are significant even at the first several mpc scales .",
    "thus , because of the small interaction depth of undeviated protons , the point like source becomes very weak .",
    "on the other hand , for igmf much weaker than @xmath2 g electrons are cooled predominantly via inverse compton scattering , thus the efficiency of synchrotron radiation drops dramatically .",
    "this scenario which involves a pair cascade in the 2.7 cmbr and extragalactic background radiation ( ebl ) , also leads to high energy gamma - rays .",
    "however , unless the field is much weaker than @xmath9 g , the cascade electrons of relatively low ( tev ) energies are thermalized , thus the cascade leads to the formation of giant halos @xcite and in this way contribute to the diffuse extragalactic gamma - ray background radiation ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) rather than to the formation of a discrete gamma - ray source ( for a discussion of different regimes of formation of cascades initiated by interactions of highest energy protons with 2.7 k   cmbr , and their detectability from the direction of the cosmic ray source see ref .",
    "the detection of the cascade component as a point like or a slightly extended source of gamma - rays initiated by interactions of ultrahigh energy protons ( after they escape the accelerator ) with 2.7  k cmbr is possible in the case of extremely small igmf , @xmath10 ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the energy spectrum and flux of synchrotron radiation of secondary electrons from photomeson interactions of protons with 2.7 k cmbr have been studied in ref .",
    "the calculations have been limited by the first 10 mpc range of propagation of protons , assuming that at this stage protons propagate radially without significant deviations , and the secondary electrons move along the same direction before they emit synchrotron photons .",
    "while this approximation gives a correct estimate of the flux , it does not specify the angle within which the radiation is confined .",
    "this approach ignores also the non - negligible tails of distribution of synchrotron radiation formed at the later stages of propagation and interactions of protons .    in the case of quasi - continuous operation of an extragalactic accelerator of protons over timescales exceeding the typical delay time due to the deflection in the magnetic field , the energy and angular distributions of protons , as well as accompanying photons and electrons , can be accurately described by the steady - state solutions of the transport equations .",
    "generally , this is the case of a continuous proton accelerator of age @xmath11  yr . in the case of shorter activity of the source ( an `` impulsive accelerator '' ) or solitary events like gamma - ray bursts , relatively simple analytical solutions of the arrival time distributions of protons , gamma - rays and neutrinos can be obtained within an approximation when the energy losses of protons are ignored .",
    "we consider the cases of `` continuous '' and `` impulsive '' proton accelerations in sections [ continuous ] and [ impulsive ] , respectively .",
    "the realization of the small - angle multiple scattering considerably simplifies the description of propagation of protons through a scattering medium .",
    "in particular , in the small - angle approximation the term @xmath12 of the boltzmann transport equation can be presented in a form allowing analytical derivation of the steady state solution . because of smallness of the single scattering angle one can write the elastic collision integral in the fokker - planck approximation . to expand the distribution function into series in terms of the single scattering angle one should have a smooth function of this angle .",
    "this condition is satisfied if one neglects unscattered part of the distribution function that has very sharp angle dependency .",
    "such an approximation is justified in the case of multiple scattering .",
    "the approach provides solutions that can be applied to the various cases which , independent of the details of the scattering medium , are characterized only by the average scattering angle per unit length @xmath13 .",
    "the scattering process depends on the particle energy , i.e. @xmath13 is a function of energy . during the propagation through the medium between two scattering centers , the energy of particles",
    "is gradually decreased due to different dissipative processes .",
    "if the change of energy in each action of interaction is considerably smaller than the initial energy , one can use the continuous energy loss approximation .",
    "it should be noted that in the approach described here the processes responsible for the scattering and the energy loss of particle are not required to be the same .",
    "the particle scattering could have elastic character and do not cause energy losses . on the other hand , the effect of deflection of particles from their original direction due to the processes responsible for energy losses might be negligibly small .",
    "this is the case of the problem considered below .",
    "one can safely ignore the change of the direction of primary particles as well as the production angles ( @xmath14 ) of the secondary products ( gamma - rays , electrons , neutrinos ) due to all relevant processes including photo - meson and pair production , inverse compton scattering , synchrotron radiation .",
    "the aim of this section is to derive distribution functions for protons and accompanying them secondary particles propagating through the galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields for a spherically symmetric point source of protons .",
    "however , it is technically more convenient to consider first a source emitting protons in a given ( fixed ) direction . in this case",
    "we have a preferential direction along the infinitely narrow beam emitted by the source .",
    "let us choose z - axis along this direction .",
    "because of the scattering , particles deviate from the initial course . to define the deviation",
    "we introduce angles @xmath15 and @xmath16 between the direction of propagation @xmath17 and the coordinate planes yoz and xoz , respectively .",
    "if @xmath17 is close to z - axis , the angles @xmath15 and @xmath16 are small and can be treated as components of two - dimensional vector @xmath18 in the xoy plane , where the absolute value of @xmath19 corresponds to the deflection angle between @xmath17 and the z - axis .",
    "then we can write @xmath20 .",
    "the retention of the second - order term @xmath21 in the expansion of @xmath22 allows us to take into account the effects relating to the elongation of the path like delay time , but does not give any considerable contribution to steady - state solution .",
    "therefore we divide the problem into two sub - problems . in the first part of the paper",
    "we solve the steady - state equation that takes into account the energy losses but ignores the elongation of particle trajectories .",
    "the results of these calculations are relevant to the `` continuous '' source of protons and describe the energy and angular distributions of protons and accompanying neutrinos and synchrotron radiation of secondary electrons produced during the propagation of protons . in the second part of the paper",
    "we calculate the distributions of arrival times of protons , neutrinos and gamma - rays in the case of an `` impulsive '' source . in this case",
    "the arrival time delays directly depend on the elongation of trajectory .",
    "the time - dependent solutions for distribution functions presented in section [ impulsive ] are limited by the approximation in which the energy losses of protons are neglected .",
    "thus , to derive the steady - state solution of the transport equation we assume @xmath23 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath24 the perpendicular displacement in the plane xoy .",
    "for a point source characterized by a monoenergetic and infinitely narrow beam of protons emitted along the z - axis we obtain the equation for green function @xmath25 of the boltzmann steady - state transport equation in the approximations of a small - angle multiple scattering and continuous energy losses : @xmath26 here we take into account that the particles are ultrarelativistic @xmath27 .",
