    "the search for the higgs boson and , hence , for the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking and fermion mass generation , remains one of the premier tasks of present and future high energy physics experiments .",
    "fits to precision electroweak ( ew ) data have for some time suggested a relatively small higgs boson mass , of order 100  gev  @xcite .",
    "this is one of the reasons why the search for an intermediate mass higgs boson is particularly important  @xcite . beyond the reach of lep at cern and of the fermilab tevatron , for masses in the @xmath7  gev range ,",
    "we show that observation of the @xmath0 decay channel at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) is quite promising .",
    "an advantage of the @xmath0 channel , in particular compared to the dominant @xmath8 mode , is the lower background from qcd processes .",
    "the @xmath0 channel thus offers the best prospects for a direct measurement of the higgs boson s couplings to fermions .    for the intermediate mass range ,",
    "most of the literature has focussed on higgs production via gluon fusion  @xcite and @xmath9  @xcite or @xmath10  @xcite associated production .",
    "cross sections for higgs production at the lhc are well - known  @xcite , and while production via gluon fusion has the largest cross section by almost one order of magnitude , there are substantial qcd backgrounds but few handles to distinguish them from the signal .",
    "essentially , only the decay products transverse momentum and the resonance in their invariant mass distribution can be used . the second largest production cross section for the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson",
    "is predicted for weak - boson fusion ( wbf ) , @xmath11 .",
    "wbf events contain additional information in the observable quark jets .",
    "techniques like forward jet tagging  @xcite can then be exploited to reduce the backgrounds .",
    "another feature of the wbf signal is the lack of color exchange between the initial - state quarks .",
    "color coherence between initial- and final - state gluon bremsstrahlung leads to suppressed hadron production in the central region , between the two tagging - jet candidates of the signal  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to most background processes , which typically involve color exchange in the @xmath12-channel and thus lead to enhanced hadronic activity in the central region .",
    "we exploit these features , via a veto on additional soft jet activity in the central region  @xcite .",
    "while some attention has been given to @xmath13 searches at the lhc  @xcite in the framework of the mssm , where the increased couplings of a / h to @xmath2 predicted for @xmath14 lead to higher production rates , conventional wisdom says that the chance of seeing the sm higgs via this decay mode is nil , and it has heretofore been ignored in the literature .",
    "thus , we provide a first analysis of intermediate - mass sm @xmath0 at the lhc ( and of the main physics and reducible backgrounds ) which demonstrates the feasibility of higgs boson detection in this channel , with modest luminosity .",
    "@xmath0 event characteristics are analyzed for one @xmath2 decaying leptonically and the other decaying hadronically , because of the high trigger efficiency and good branching ratio of this mode ; ref .",
    "@xcite found the dual leptonic decay mode to be considerably more difficult due to higher backgrounds .",
    "our analysis is a parton - level monte carlo study , using full tree - level matrix elements for the weak boson fusion higgs signal and the various backgrounds . in section  [ sec : two ] we describe our calculational tools , the methods employed in the simulation of the various processes , and important parameters .",
    "extra minijet activity is simulated by adding the emission of one extra parton to the basic signal and background processes .",
    "generically we call the basic signal process ( with its two forward tagging jets ) and the corresponding background calculations `` 2-jet '' programs , and refer to the simulations with one extra parton as `` 3-jet '' programs . in sections",
    "[ sec : three ]  &  [ sec : four ] , using the 2-jet programs for physics and reducible backgrounds , respectively , we demonstrate forward jet tagging and @xmath2 identification and reconstruction criteria which yield an @xmath152/1 signal - to - background ( s / b ) ratio . both the @xmath16 and @xmath17 reducible backgrounds intrinsically are much larger than the @xmath1 and drell - yan @xmath2-pair production backgrounds .",
    "we explain and emphasize the cuts crucial to reducing these backgrounds to a manageable level .    in section  [ sec :",
    "five ] we analyze the different minijet patterns in signal and background , using the truncated shower approximation ( tsa )  @xcite to regulate the cross sections . by exploiting the two most important characteristics of the extra radiation , its angular distribution and its hardness ,",
    "the qcd backgrounds can be suppressed substantially by a veto on extra central jet emission . within the tsa ,",
    "probabilities are estimated for vetoing signal and background events , and are combined with the production cross sections of the previous section to predict signal and background rates in table  [ table4 ] .",
    "these rates demonstrate the possibility to extract a very low background @xmath18 signal at the lhc .",
    "our signal selection is not necessarily optimized yet .",
    "additional observables are available to distinguish the signal from background . the final discussion in section  [ sec : six ] includes a survey of distributions which can be used , e.g. in neural - net algorithms , to further improve the signal significance .",
    "we simulate @xmath19 collisions at the cern lhc , @xmath20  tev .",
    "all signal and background cross sections are determined in terms of full tree level matrix elements for the contributing subprocesses and will be discussed in more detail below .    for all our numerical results we have chosen @xmath21 , @xmath22  gev , and @xmath23 , which translates into @xmath24  gev and @xmath25 when using the tree - level relations between these input parameters .",
    "this value of @xmath26 is somewhat lower than the current world average of @xmath27 gev .",
    "however , this difference has negligible effects on all cross sections , e.g. the @xmath28 signal cross section varies by about @xmath29 for these two @xmath30 mass values .",
    "the tree level relations between the input parameters are kept in order to guarantee electroweak gauge invariance of all amplitudes . for all qcd effects , the running of the strong - coupling constant",
    "is evaluated at one - loop order , with @xmath31 .",
    "we employ cteq4l parton distribution functions  @xcite throughout . unless otherwise noted the factorization scale is chosen as @xmath32 min(@xmath33 ) of the defined jets .",
    "the signal can be described , at lowest order , by two single - feynman - diagram processes , @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath36 and @xmath37 fusion where the weak bosons are emitted from the incoming quarks  @xcite . from a previous study of @xmath38",
    "decays in weak boson fusion  @xcite we know several features of the signal , which we can directly exploit here : the centrally produced higgs boson tends to yield central decay products ( in this case @xmath39 ) , and the two quarks enter the detector at large rapidity compared to the @xmath2 s and with transverse momenta in the 20 to 80 gev range , thus leading to two observable forward tagging jets .    for the study of a central jet veto",
    ", the emission of at least one extra parton must be simulated .",
    "this is achieved by calculating the cross sections for the process @xmath40 ,",
    "i.e. weak boson fusion with radiation of an additional gluon , and all crossing related process .",
    "these include q|q q|qhg , |q|q |q|qhg , qg qq|qh , |q g |qq|qh , [ procsig ] and can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . for this case with three final state partons , the factorization scale is chosen as @xmath32 min(@xmath33 ) of the tagging jets and the renormalization scale @xmath41 is set to the transverse momentum of the non - tagging parton ( minijet ) .",
    "different scale choices or different input parameters will , of course , affect our numerical results .",
    "variation of the factorization scale by a factor of two changes the 2-jet cross section in the last column of table  [ table1 ] by @xmath42 .    in the following we only consider @xmath2-pair decays with one @xmath2 decaying leptonically , @xmath43 , and the other decaying hadronically , @xmath44 , with a combined branching fraction of @xmath45 .",
    "our analysis critically employs transverse momentum cuts on the charged @xmath2-decay products and , hence , some care must be taken to ensure realistic momentum distributions .",
    "because of its small mass , we simulate the @xmath2 decays in the collinear approximation .",
    "the momentum fraction @xmath46 of the charged decay lepton in @xmath47 is generated according to the decay distribution = 13 ( 1-z ) . here",
    "@xmath48 denotes the chirality of the decaying @xmath2 ( which , for a negative helicity @xmath49 or positive helicity @xmath50 , is given by @xmath51 in the collinear limit ) .",
    "similarly the pion spectrum for @xmath52 decays is given by 1 + _ ( 2z-1 ) .",
    "decay distributions for @xmath53 and @xmath54 are taken from ref .",
    "we add the decay distributions from the various hadronic decay modes according to their branching ratios .",
    "the vector meson decays are simulated in the narrow width approximation , which is adequate for our purposes .",
    "the decay of the higgs scalar produces @xmath2 s of opposite chirality , @xmath55 and this anti - correlation of the @xmath56 polarizations is taken into account .",
    "positive identification of the hadronic @xmath44 decay requires severe cuts on the charged hadron isolation .",
    "possible strategies have been analyzed by cavalli _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and we base our simulations on their result . considering hadronic jets of @xmath57  gev in the atlas detector , they find non - tau rejection factors of 400 or more ( see below ) while retaining true hadronic @xmath2 decays with an identification efficiency [ eq : epstauh ] _ ( + hadrons ) = 0.26 .",
    "this estimate includes the requirement of seeing a single charged hadron track , of @xmath58  gev , pointing in the @xmath2 direction , and thus effectively singles out 1-prong @xmath2 decays .",
    "accordingly , only the 1-prong hadronic branching ratios are considered in our mixture of @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 modes .",
    "since the overall efficiency includes 3-prong events , which have negligible acceptance , the effective efficiency for 1-prong events is larger and taken as 0.34 in the following , which reproduces the overall efficiency of eq .",
    "( [ eq : epstauh ] ) .      given the h decay signature ,",
    "the main physics background to our signal @xmath63 events arises from real emission qcd corrections to the drell - yan process @xmath64 . for @xmath63 events",
    "these background processes include  @xcite [ procback ] q g q g ^+ ^- , q q q q ^+ ^- , which are dominated by @xmath12-channel gluon exchange , and all crossing related processes , such as q |q g g ^+ ^- , g g q |q ^+ ^- .",
    "all interference effects between virtual photon and @xmath65-exchange are included .",
    "the @xmath65 component dominates , however , and we call these processes collectively the `` qcd @xmath66 '' background .",
    "the cross sections for the corresponding @xmath67-jet processes , which we need for our modeling of minijet activity in the qcd @xmath66 background , have been calculated in refs .",
    "similar to the treatment of the signal processes , we use a parton - level monte - carlo program based on the work of ref .",
    "@xcite to model the qcd @xmath66 and @xmath68 backgrounds .",
    "the factorization scale is chosen as for the higgs boson signal . with",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath70 colored partons in the final state , the overall strong - coupling constant factors are taken as @xmath71 , _",
    "i.e. _ the transverse momentum of each additional parton is taken as the relevant scale for its production , irrespective of the hardness of the underlying scattering event .",
    "this procedure guarantees that the same @xmath72 factors are used for the hard part of a @xmath66 event , independent of the number of additional minijets , and at the same time the small scales relevant for soft - gluon emission are implemented .",
    "the momentum distributions for the @xmath2 decay products are generated as for the higgs boson signal . because of the ( axial)-vector coupling of the virtual @xmath73 to @xmath2 s , the produced @xmath50 and @xmath49 have the same chirality .",
    "this correlation of the @xmath2 polarizations is taken into account by calculating individual helicity amplitudes and folding the corresponding cross sections with the appropriate @xmath50 and @xmath49 decay distributions , i.e. the full @xmath2 polarization information is retained in the energy distribution of the @xmath2 decay products .",
    "these backgrounds arise from @xmath65 and @xmath74 bremsstrahlung in quark(anti)quark scattering via @xmath12-channel electroweak boson exchange , with subsequent decay @xmath75 : qq qq ^+^- [ eq : qqqqz ] naively , this ew background may be thought of as suppressed compared to the analogous qcd process in eq .",
    "( [ procback ] ) .",
    "however , the ew background includes electroweak boson fusion , @xmath76 , either via @xmath12-channel @xmath77-exchange or via @xmath78-channel @xmath79-exchange , and the latter has a momentum and color structure which is identical to the signal and can not easily be suppressed via cuts .",
    "we use the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for our calculation which ignore @xmath78-channel ew boson exchange contributing to @xmath80 production , and pauli interference of identical quarks .",
    "when requiring a large rapidity separation between the two quark jets ( tagging jets ) the resulting large dijet invariant mass severely suppresses any @xmath78-channel processes which might give rise to the dijet pair , and the very different phase space regions of the two scattered quarks make pauli interference effects small .",
    "all charged - current ( cc ) and neutral - current ( nc ) subprocesses are included .",
    "the cc process dominates over nc exchange , however , mainly because of the larger coupling of the quarks to the @xmath30 as compared to photon and @xmath65 interactions . as in the qcd @xmath66 case ,",
    "the @xmath65-pole dominates the @xmath39 invariant mass distribution , so we will refer to these ew processes as the `` ew @xmath66 '' background .",

    "@xcite generate polarization averaged @xmath39 cross sections , we have to assume unpolarized @xmath2 s . however , as for the qcd @xmath66 background , the @xmath39 pair arises from virtual vector boson decay , resulting in a @xmath50 and @xmath49 of the same chirality .",
    "this correlation of the @xmath2 polarizations is taken into account .    in order to determine the minijet activity in the ew",
    "@xmath66 background we need to evaluate the @xmath81 real parton emission corrections .",
    "the corresponding @xmath82 diagrams for qqqqg^+^- , [ eq : qqqqgtautau ] and all crossing related subprocesses , have first been calculated in ref .",
    "production of the @xmath2-pair via @xmath65 and @xmath74 exchange is considered .",
    "the factorization and renormalization scales are chosen to be the same as for the @xmath83 signal , as this is also a hard ew process .",
    "we have previously examined other scale choices for the @xmath65 backgrounds  @xcite , and found small uncertainties ( @xmath84 ) for the ew component , while variations for the qcd component reach a factor 1.5 .",
    "we thus expect the signal and ew @xmath66 background cross sections to be fairly well determined at leading order , while the much larger theoretical uncertainty for the qcd @xmath66 background emphasizes the need for experimental input .",
    "reducible backgrounds to @xmath86 events can arise from any process with a hard , isolated lepton , missing @xmath33 , and an additional narrow jet in the final state which can be mistaken as a hadronically decaying @xmath2 .",
    "a primary reducible background thus arises from leptonic @xmath30 decays in @xmath87 events , where additional qcd radiation supplies the two tagging jet candidates . at lowest order",
    "we need to consider @xmath16 production as the hard process , which is very similar to the simulation of the qcd @xmath68 background discussed before , with the bremsstrahlung @xmath65 replaced by a @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath88 decays only are considered and are treated as a fake @xmath2 decaying leptonically .",
    "real leptonic @xmath2 decays from @xmath89 are relatively suppressed by the @xmath2 leptonic branching ratio of @xmath90 and the severity of the transverse momentum cuts on the softer charged lepton spectrum .",
    "they will be ignored in the following .",
    "two of the jets in @xmath16 events are identified as tagging jets , and fluctuations of the third into a narrow jet are considered , resembling a hadronically - decaying @xmath2 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the probability for misidentifying a gluon or light - quark jet as a hadronic @xmath2 decay was estimated as [ eq : epsjtau ] _ ( jet+hadrons  ) = 0.0025 , and we assign this probability to each of the final state jets . in each event one of the hard partons is randomly assigned to be the @xmath2 . to mimic the signal ,",
    "this jet and the identified charged lepton must be of opposite charge .",
    "thus , we reduce the @xmath16 background by an additional factor of two to simulate the opposite charge requirement for the single track allowed in the @xmath2-like jet .",
    "as the @xmath16 events are a qcd background , we use the same factorization and renormalization scales as for the qcd @xmath66 case .    to simulate additional minijet emission , we need to add one more parton to the final state .",
    "the code for @xmath91 matrix elements has been available since the work of berends et al .",
    "here we use the program developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which was generated via madgraph  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath91 production produces a six - particle final state , with up to 516 graphs for the most complicated processes , it takes considerable cpu time to obtain good statistics .",
    "we modified the madgraph code to do random helicity summation , speeding up the calculation by approximately a factor of 3 for a given statistical error in the final cross section .",
    "as before , @xmath92 is taken as the geometric mean of @xmath93 factors for each of the partons , including the parton which fakes the hadronic @xmath2 decay .",
    "the semileptonic decay of @xmath94-quarks provides another source of leptons and neutrinos which can be misidentified as tau decays . even though @xmath94-quark decays are unlikely to lead to isolated charged leptons and very narrow tau - like jets in a single event , the sheer number of @xmath95 pairs produced at the lhc makes them potentially dangerous .",
    "indeed , the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath95 pairs lead to a reducible @xmath39 background which is similar in size to @xmath87 production .",
    "we therefore study @xmath17 production as our second reducible background and neglect any other sources like @xmath96 events which were shown to give substantially smaller backgrounds to @xmath39-pairs in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we only consider @xmath94-production events where both @xmath94-quarks have large transverse momentum .",
    "in addition , two forward tagging jets will be required as part of the signal event selection .",
    "the relevant leading order process therefore is the production of @xmath4 pairs in association with two jets , which includes the subprocesses gg & & b|b gg + qg & & b|b qg + q_1 q_2 & & b|b q_1 q_2 .",
    "the exact matrix elements for the @xmath97 processes are evaluated , including all the crossing related subprocesses , and retaining a finite @xmath94-quark mass  @xcite .",
    "the pauli interference terms between identical quark flavors in the process @xmath98 are neglected , with little effect in the overall cross section , due to the large differences in the rapidity of the final state partons .",
    "the factorization scale is chosen as the smallest transverse energy of the final state partons before the @xmath94-quark decay .",
    "the strong coupling constant @xmath99 is evaluated at the corresponding transverse energy of the final state partons , i.e. , @xmath100 .",
    "the semileptonic decay @xmath101 of one of the @xmath94-quarks is simulated by multiplying the @xmath17 cross section by a branching ratio factor of 0.395 ( corresponding to at least one semileptonic @xmath94-decay to occur ) and by implementing a three - body phase space distribution for the decay momenta .",
    "this part of the simulation is performed in order to estimate the effects of the lepton isolation cuts on the transverse momentum distributions of the @xmath94-decay leptons . since these are kinematic effects we use the lightest meson masses in the simulation and set @xmath102  gev and @xmath103  gev .",
    "@xcite a factor 100 reduction of the @xmath4 background was found as a result of lepton isolation , requiring @xmath104  gev in a cone of radius 0.6 around the charged lepton . in our simulation , after energy smearing of the charm quark jet ( see below ) , we find a reduction factor of 52 due to lepton isolation with a cone of radius 0.7 .",
    "however , our simulation does not include parton showers or hadronization of the @xmath94-quark , effectively replacing the @xmath94-quark fragmentation function by a delta - function at one , and thus underestimates the effect of lepton isolation cuts on the @xmath94-quark background . to compensate for this",
    ", we multiply our @xmath17 rates by another factor 0.52 , thus effectively implementing the factor 100 suppression found by cavalli _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "in addition to an isolated lepton , the @xmath17 events must produce a narrow jet which is consistent with a hadronic @xmath2 decay , and has charge opposite the identified charged lepton .",
    "this may either be one of the light quark or gluon jets , for which the misidentification probability of @xmath105 of eq .",

    "since we are really interested in an upper bound on the @xmath17 background we follow the atlas proposal  @xcite instead , and use the upper bound , [ eq : epsbtau - atlas ] _ ( b+hadrons  ) < 0.0015 , for our analysis . thus , all our @xmath17 cross sections , after @xmath2 identification ,",
    "should be considered conservative estimates . a more precise analysis of @xmath106 misidentification probabilities in the lhc detectors",
    "is clearly needed , which is beyond the scope of the present work . finally , an additional overall factor of two reduction is applied , as in the @xmath16 case , for the lepton - jet opposite charge requirement .",
    "the purpose of our @xmath94-analysis is to verify that @xmath94 semileptonic decays do not overwhelm the signal .",
    "the above procedures are adequate for this purpose , since we obtain final @xmath17 backgrounds ( in table  [ table4 ] ) which are 20 to 40 times smaller than the signal",

    "this would require @xmath109  jet matrix elements which are not yet available .",
    "rather , in section  [ sec : five ] , we assume the probability for extra minijet emission to be the same as for the other reducible qcd background , @xmath16 production .      the qcd processes discussed above lead to steeply falling jet transverse momentum distributions . as a result",
    ", finite detector resolution can have a sizable effect on cross sections .",

    "following atlas expectations  @xcite we use resolutions = 5.2 e .009 , for jets ( with individual terms added in quadrature ) , while for charged leptons we use = 2% .",
    "in addition , finite detector resolution leads to fake missing transverse momentum in events with hard jets .",
    "an atlas analysis  @xcite showed that these effects are well parameterized by a gaussian distribution of the components of the fake missing transverse momentum vector , @xmath112 , with resolution ( p_x , p_y ) = 0.46 , for each component . in our calculations",

    "the @xmath114 signal is characterized by two forward jets and the @xmath2 decay products . before discussing background levels and further details like minijet radiation patterns ,",
    "we need to identify the search region for these hard @xmath83 events . prior to @xmath2 identification ,",
    "the task is identical to the higgs search in @xmath115 which was considered previously  @xcite .",
    "we can thus adopt the strategy of this earlier analysis and start out by discussing three levels of cuts on the @xmath114 signal , before considering @xmath2 decay and @xmath2 identification .",
    "this procedure makes explicit the source of the major signal reduction factors which we will encounter .",
    "the basic acceptance requirements must ensure that the two jets and two @xmath2 s are observed inside the detector ( within the hadronic and electromagnetic calorimeters , respectively ) , and are well - separated from each other : & p_t_j(1,2 ) 40 , 20  gev , |_j| 5.0 , r_jj 0.7 , & + & |_| 2.5 , r_j 0.7 , r _ 0.7 . &",
    "[ eq : basic ] slightly more than half of all signal events pass these basic cuts .",
    "the staggered @xmath116 cuts anticipate the steeply falling transverse momentum distributions of both jets for the qcd backgrounds , which are dominated by bremsstrahlung gluons . in contrast , for the @xmath83 signal , the @xmath33 scale is set by the mass of the exchanged weak bosons and most of the tagging jets survive these cuts .    another feature of the irreducible qcd background is the generally higher rapidity of the @xmath2 s as compared to the higgs signal : @xmath65 and @xmath74 bremsstrahlung occur at small angles with respect to the parent quarks , producing @xmath2 s forward of the jets .",

    "in contrast , the ew processes give rise to quite central leptons , and this includes not only the higgs signal but also ew @xmath66 production , which also proceeds via weak boson fusion .",
    "it is this similarity that prevents one from ignoring ew @xmath66 processes , which a priori are smaller by two orders of magnitude in total cross section , but after final cuts remain the same size as their qcd counterparts .",
    "we advocate taking advantage of an additional fundamental characteristic of qcd and ew processes .",
    "color - singlet exchange in the @xmath12-channel , as encountered in higgs boson production by weak boson fusion ( and in the ew @xmath66 background ) , leads to additional soft jet activity which differs strikingly from that expected for the qcd backgrounds in both geometry and hardness : gluon radiation in qcd processes is typically both more central and harder than in wbf processes .",
    "we exploit this radiation , via a veto on events with central minijets , and expect a typical @xmath124 reduction in qcd backgrounds , but only about a @xmath125 loss of the signal .",
    "the properties mentioned so far are generic in the search for weak boson fusion events .",
    "additional cuts are specific to the @xmath18 channel , with one @xmath2 decaying leptonically and the other one decaying hadronically .",
    "crucial are charged lepton isolation and efficient identification of the hadronically decaying @xmath2 , which are needed for the suppression of heavy quark backgrounds and non-@xmath2 hadronic jets .",
    "this part of the analysis we have adapted from ref .",
    "@xcite , which , however , was performed for @xmath126 events from gluon fusion , i.e. without requiring two additional forward tagging jets .",
    "a more detailed assessment of lepton isolation and hadronic @xmath2 identification in the present context is beyond the scope of the present work and should be performed with a full detector simulation .",
    "the elimination of the @xmath16 reducible background depends highly upon the jacobian peak in the transverse mass distribution of the @xmath30 decay products .",
    "the other backgrounds and the higgs signal typically produce rather small values of @xmath127 , below 30  gev , and thus well below the peak in @xmath128",
    ".      another distinguishing feature of real @xmath2 decays are the reconstructed momentum fractions @xmath129 and @xmath130 of the charged decay lepton and of the decay hadrons .",
    "misidentified `` @xmath2 s '' tend to produce unphysically large values for these momentum fractions and can thereby be eliminated to a substantial degree ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : x1x2 ] ) .",
    "the reconstruction of these @xmath2 momentum fractions is possible since the @xmath39 pairs are typically being produced with sizable transverse momenta ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : taudata]c ) ) . as a result",
    "back - to - back @xmath39 decay products are rare ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : taudata]b ) ) and this in turns allows the mass reconstruction of the @xmath2-pair , which is crucial for the suppression of the main physics background , @xmath131 .",
    "we have not made full use of the differences between the higgs signal and the various backgrounds in some of these distributions .",
    "additional examples are shown in figures [ fig : lepton ] and [ fig : taudata ] . fig .",
    "[ fig : lepton ] shows the @xmath132 and @xmath133 distributions for the observable charged lepton , which will form an important part of the event trigger . as a result of the lepton isolation cut ,",
    "the @xmath132 falloff is considerably steeper for the @xmath17 background than for the signal and the other backgrounds .",
    "not much leeway is present in applying more stringent cuts , however , without losing a substantial fraction of the signal .",
    "one can also take advantage of the @xmath134 distribution for the qcd @xmath66 background , which , at the final level of cuts , remains important in particular for small values of the higgs boson mass .",
    "in addition to the lepton @xmath33 , we may use the missing transverse momentum of the event , @xmath135 , fig .",
    "[ fig : taudata ]  ( a ) , which is exceptionally small for the @xmath17 background . in combination with a more stringent cut on the @xmath2 pair opening angle , cos(@xmath136 ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : taudata ]  ( b ) ( where an even more striking distinction between the physics and the reducible processes is found ) , both the @xmath16 and @xmath17 backgrounds can be reduced even below the level discussed in section  [ sec : five ] .",
    "such a strategy , however , may not increase the statistical significance of the signal . in fact we find that slightly looser cuts , for example on the dijet invariant mass , @xmath137 , can somewhat increase the significance of the signal while reducing the signal - to - background ratio .",
    "these points demonstrate that we have not yet optimized the search strategy for @xmath18 decays .",
    "this might be possible by combining the information from all the distributions mentioned above in a neural - net analysis .",
    "it is premature at this stage , however , to perform such an analysis since the issues of @xmath2-identification or of suppression of heavy quark decays in a realistic detector need to be addressed simultaneously , for the specific processes considered here .    beyond the possibility of discovering the higgs boson in the @xmath18 mode , or confirmation of its existence",
    ", the independent measurement of the @xmath6 coupling will be another important reason to strive for observation of @xmath18 decays at the lhc .",
    "for such a measurement , via the analysis outlined in this paper , @xmath2-identification efficiencies , minijet veto probabilities etc . must be precisely known . for calibration purposes ,",
    "the presence of the @xmath131 peak in fig .",
    "[ fig : mtautau ] will be of enormous benefit .",
    "the production rates of the qcd and ew @xmath66 events can be reliably predicted and , thus , the observation of the @xmath131 peak allows for a direct experimental assessment of the needed efficiencies , in a kinematic configuration which is very similar to the higgs signal .",
    "observation of the @xmath18 decay mode at the lhc , for the sm higgs , and for modest integrated luminosities appears to be a real possibility .",
    "what is needed is that the higgs boson lies in the mass range between present lep limits and about 150 gev , where its @xmath122 branching fraction is sizable . in models beyond the sm prospects",
    "may be even better .",
    "weak boson fusion at the lhc will be an exciting process to study at the lhc , for a weakly coupled higgs sector just as much as for strong interactions in the symmetry breaking sector of electroweak interactions .",
    "we would like to thank tao han for useful discussions and use of his programs for @xmath94 decay simulations .",
