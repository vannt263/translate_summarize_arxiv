    "a _ lissajous _ knot @xmath12 in @xmath13 is a knot that has a parameterization @xmath14 given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 are integers , and @xmath17 .",
    "[ lissajous definition ]    lissajous knots were first studied in @xcite where some of their elementary properties were established .",
    "most notably , lissajous knots enjoy a high degree of symmetry .",
    "in particular , if the three _ frequencies _ @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( which must be pairwise relatively prime  see @xcite ) are all odd , then the knot is strongly plus amphicheiral .",
    "if one of the frequencies is even , then the knot is 2-periodic , with the additional property that it links its axis of rotation once .",
    "these symmetry properties imply ( strictly ) weaker properties such as the fact that the alexander polynomial of a lissajous knot must be a square mod 2 , which in turn implies that its arf invariant must be zero .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for details .",
    "thus for example , the trefoil and figure eight knots are not lissajous since their arf invariants are one .",
    "in fact , `` most '' knots are not lissajous .",
    "to date it is unknown if every knot which is strongly plus amphicheiral or 2-periodic ( and links its axis of rotation once ) is lissajous .",
    "several knots with relatively few crossings exist which meet these symmetry requirements and yet are still unknown to be lissajous or not .",
    "for example , according to @xcite there are only three prime knots with 12 or less crossings which are strongly plus amphicheiral : 10a103 ( @xmath18 , 10a121 ( @xmath19 ) , and 12a427 . here",
    "we have given knot names in both the dowker - thistlethwaite ordering of the hoste - thistlethwaite - weeks table @xcite and , in parenthesis , the rolfsen  @xcite ordering ( for knots with 10 or less crossings ) .",
    "symmetries of the knots in the hoste - thistlethwaite - weeks table were computed using _",
    "snappea _ as described in @xcite . of these three knots ,",
    "only 10a103 ( @xmath20 ) was previously reported as lissajous .",
    "( see @xcite and @xcite . )",
    "however we find 12a427 to be lissajous .",
    "( see section  [ sampling ] of this paper . )",
    "this leaves open the case of 10a121 . as a further example , there are exactly four 8-crossings knots which are 2-bridge , 2-periodic , and link their axis of rotation once . despite our extensive searching ( see section  [ sampling ] ) only one of these knots turned up as lissajous ( and it had already been reported as such in @xcite ) .",
    "whether the other three are lissajous remains unknown .",
    "lissajous knots are a subset of the more general class of _ fourier _ knots .",
    "a fourier-@xmath21 knot is one that can be parameterized as @xmath22 because any function can be closely approximated by a sum of cosines , every knot is a fourier knot for some @xmath21 .",
    "but a remarkable theorem of lamm @xcite states that in fact every knot is a fourier-@xmath10 knot for some @xmath9 . while @xmath9 can not equal one for all knots ( these are the lissajous knots , and not all knots are lissajous )",
    "could @xmath9 possibly be less than some universal bound @xmath23 for all knots ?",
    "this seems unlikely , with the more reasonable outcome being that @xmath9 depends on the specific knot @xmath12 .",
    "yet no one has found a knot for which @xmath9 must be bigger than two !",
    "if @xmath12 is a fourier-@xmath10 knot then its bridge number is less than or equal to the minimum of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "( the bridge number of a knot @xmath12 can be defined as the smallest number of extrema on @xmath12 with respect to a given direction in @xmath26 , taken over all representations of @xmath12 and with respect to all directions .",
    "see @xcite or @xcite for more details . )",
    "moreover , lamm s proof is constructive and explicitly shows that if @xmath12 has bridge number @xmath27 , then @xmath12 is a fourier-@xmath10 knot for some @xmath9 and with @xmath28 .",
    "this raises several interesting questions . for any knot @xmath12 , when expressed as a fourier-@xmath10 knot , can the minimum values of @xmath24 and @xmath9 be simultaneously realized ?",
    "in particular , can a knot which is lissajous and with bridge index @xmath27 be realized as a lissajous knot with @xmath28 ?",
    "let @xmath29 be the set of all lissajous knots with frequencies @xmath30 .",
    "( throughout this paper we consider a knot and its mirror image to be equivalent . )",
    "one of the main goals of this paper is to investigate the set @xmath29 . by a simple change of variables , @xmath31",
    ", we may alter the phase shifts .",
    "therefore we will assume that @xmath32 in all that follows .",
    "this leaves the pair of parameters @xmath33 which vary within the _ phase torus _",
    "@xmath34\\times [ 0,2 \\pi]$ ] . in section  [ lissajous phase torus ]",
    "we examine the phase torus and identify a finite number of regions in which the phase shifts must lie , with each region corresponding to a single knot type .",
    "we further show that a periodic pattern of knot types are produced as one traverses the phase torus .",
    "this allows us to prove    [ first bound ] let @xmath35 be the number of distinct lissajous knots with frequencies @xmath36 . then @xmath37 if furthermore @xmath38 , then @xmath39    there is also a periodicity that exists across frequencies and in section  [ lissajous phase torus ] we also prove    [ periodicity in n_z ] @xmath40 , with equality if @xmath41 .",
    "our analysis of the phase torus , together with these theorems allow us to efficiently sample ( with the aid of a computer ) all possible lissajous knots having two of the three frequencies bounded . even with relatively small frequencies , the three natural projections of a lissajous knot into the three coordinate planes can have a large number of crossings .",
    "( the projection into the @xmath42-plane has @xmath43 crossings . ) with frequencies of 10 or more , diagrams with hundreds of crossings result and many , if not most , knot invariants are computationally out of reach .",
    "thus it becomes extremely difficult to compare different lissajous knots with large frequencies , or to try to locate them in existing knot tables .",
    "however , if one frequency is two , the knot is 2-bridge and even with hundreds of crossings it is relatively simple to compute the identifying fraction @xmath44 by which 2-bridge knots are classified .",
    "in section  [ lissajous phase torus ] we recall basic facts about lissajous knots and prove several theorems , including the two already mentioned , that will allow us to efficiently sample all lissajous knots with two given frequencies . in section  [ 2-bridge knots ] we then recall some basic facts about 2-bridge knots . using these results",
    "we then report in section  [ sampling ] on our computer experiments .",
    "theorems similar to those given in section  [ lissajous phase torus ] but for fourier-@xmath10 knots would necessarily be much more complicated and we only begin the analysis of the phase torus for fourier-@xmath11 knots in section  [ fourier phase torus ] . without the analogous results , we have not been able to rigorously sample fourier knots .",
    "instead , we have proceeded by two methods , either random sampling , or a sampling based on first forming a bitmap image of the phase torus and its singular curves . however , even without exhaustive sampling , our data show that all 2-bridge knots up to 14 crossings are fourier-@xmath10 knots with @xmath45 and with @xmath38 .",
    "this research was carried out at the claremont college s reu program in the summer of 2006 .",
    "the authors thank the national science foundation and the claremont colleges for their generous support .",
    "suppose @xmath46 is a lissajous knot and consider its diagram in the @xmath42-plane .",
    "each crossing in this diagram corresponds to a double point in the @xmath42-projection given by a pair of times @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the following lemma is given in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath46 be a lissajous knot .",
    "there are two types of time pairs @xmath47 that give double points in the @xmath42-projection : @xmath50 there are @xmath51 double points of type i , and @xmath52 double points of type ii .",
    "figure  [ 357knot ] shows a lissajous knot with frequencies @xmath53 and corresponding phase shifts @xmath54 .",
    "since all the frequencies are odd , this knot is symmetric through the origin .",
    "it is not hard to show that in general , the type i crossings line up in sets of size @xmath25 on @xmath55 horizontal lines , while the type ii crossings line up in sets of size @xmath24 on @xmath56 vertical lines . if @xmath38 there is a single row of type i crossings , all of which lie on the @xmath57-axis and @xmath56 columns of type ii crossings with each column consisting of two crossings .",
    "not all phase shift pairs will generate curves that are knots .",
    "assuming @xmath32 , the knot @xmath46 will intersect itself , and thus fail to be a knot , exactly when the phase shifts satisfy @xmath58 for some integer @xmath59 .",
    "crossings of type i become singular precisely when equation  [ type i singular lines ] holds ; crossings of type ii when equaton  [ type ii singular lines ] holds .",
    "when equation  [ vertical singular lines ] holds , the entire @xmath42-projection degenerates to an arc .",
    "while this alone does not imply the knot has points of self - intersection , this is indeed the case .",
    "see @xcite for more details . in proposition  [ crossing diagonal ] , we specifically identify which crossings become singular as the phase shifts move across these lines .    the slanted , horizontal and vertical lines given in equations  [ type",
    "i singular lines][vertical singular lines ] obviously divide the phase torus into regions with each region defining one knot type .",
    "thus there are only a finite number of knots types possible for a given set of frequencies .",
    "there is , however , a great deal of repetition in knot types as one traverses the phase torus due to the periodicity of the cosine function .",
    "the following theorem describes a nice choice of `` fundamental domain '' on the phase torus to which we may restrict our attention .",
    "[ fundamental domain ] any knot in @xmath60 can be represented with @xmath32 and using some phase shift pair @xmath33 in @xmath61\\times[0,\\pi]$ ] .",
    "define an equivalence relation @xmath62 on the phase torus for @xmath60 by @xmath63 if the lissajous knot with phase shifts @xmath64 is the same as the knot with phase shifts @xmath65 , or its mirror image .",
    "clearly @xmath66 if @xmath67 , a change of variable @xmath68 shows that @xmath12 is also parameterized as @xmath69therefore",
    "we also have @xmath70 now since @xmath24 and @xmath25 are relatively prime , there are integers @xmath9 and @xmath59 with @xmath71 . repeatedly using ( [ pi shift ] ) and ( [ other shift ] ) we obtain @xmath72",
    "the first coordinate is already in @xmath61 $ ] ; we can shift the second coordinate by multiples of @xmath73 until it is in @xmath74 $ ] .",
    "thus an arbitrary point @xmath75 is equivalent to some point in @xmath61\\times[0,\\pi]$ ] , as desired .",
    "figure  [ 235phasetorus ] shows the fundamental domain on the phase torus for @xmath76 .",
    "the singular lines divide the domain into regions with each region determining a single knot type .",
    "since these knots are all 2-bridge , we identify each with its classifying fraction @xmath44 .",
    "our next result specifically describes what happens as we cross a singular line of the type given in equation  [ type i singular lines ] or [ type ii singular lines ] .",
    "let @xmath12 and @xmath77 be two lissajous knots with frequencies @xmath78 and phase shifts @xmath75 and @xmath79 respectively .    1 .",
    "suppose @xmath75 and @xmath79 lie in two adjacent regions of the phase torus separated by a diagonal line @xmath80 given by @xmath81 .",
    "then @xmath12 and @xmath77 differ by changing all type  i crossings with parameters @xmath82 such that with @xmath83 .",
    "the number of such crossings is @xmath55 .",
    "2 .   suppose @xmath75 and @xmath79 lie in two adjacent regions of the phase torus separated by a horizontal line @xmath80 given by @xmath84 .",
    "then @xmath12 and @xmath77 differ by changing all type  ii crossings with parameters @xmath82 such that @xmath85 .",
    "the number of such crossings is @xmath56 .",
    "[ crossing diagonal ]    if @xmath47 is a type i crossing with parameters @xmath82 , then @xmath86 if and only if @xmath87 which will occur if and only if @xmath88 for some integers @xmath89 .",
    "for type i crossings , @xmath90 if ( [ singular or ] ) is to hold , then in the first case , we have @xmath91 which is equivalent to @xmath92 .",
    "this is impossible since @xmath24 and @xmath2 are relatively prime and @xmath93 .    in the second case",
    ", we have @xmath94 which is equivalent to @xmath95 thus type i crossings only become singular on lines of the form given in equation  [ type i singular lines ] with @xmath96 .",
    "if @xmath97 and @xmath98 for some integer @xmath99 then it is straightforward to check that @xmath100 hence , as we move across the line @xmath80 by letting @xmath101 go from a small positive value to a small negative value , the difference @xmath102 changes sign . thus the type i crossings with parameters @xmath82 actually change from over to under or vice versa , rather than simply becoming singular and then `` rebounding '' to their original positions .",
    "finally , note that once @xmath59 is fixed this does not necessarily uniquely determine @xmath103 and thus the corresponding type i crossing .",
    "if both @xmath104 mod @xmath25 and @xmath105 mod @xmath25 then @xmath106 mod @xmath25 since @xmath25 and @xmath2 are relatively prime . if @xmath38 , then @xmath107 and @xmath103 lies in an interval of length @xmath25 .",
    "thus with @xmath38 we have that @xmath103 is uniquely determined by @xmath59 and a single crossing changes as we move across @xmath80 .",
    "but if @xmath108 and @xmath107 then @xmath103 lies in an interval of length greater than @xmath25 . hence two admissible values , @xmath103 and @xmath109 , are possible .",
    "using @xmath103 , we must have @xmath110 while for @xmath109 we must have @xmath111 .",
    "thus the total number of possible points @xmath82 is @xmath112 .",
    "a similar discussion handles the type ii crossings .",
    "suppose @xmath12 and @xmath77 are lissajous knots with frequencies @xmath78 and phase shifts which belong to regions separated by @xmath113 singular lines of the type given in equation  [ type i singular lines ] .",
    "then all type i crossings are the same for both knots .",
    "[ periodicity in box ]    from proposition  [ crossing diagonal ] we know that crossing the line @xmath81 changes exactly those type i crossings with parameters @xmath82 for which @xmath114 mod @xmath25 .",
    "thus if we cross the singular line corresponding to @xmath59 and then later cross the line corresponding to @xmath115 the same set of type i crossings will first be changed and then changed back again .",
    "hence , after crossing over @xmath116 such lines all type i crossings will be restored to their original position .",
    "if @xmath38 there is even more repetition due to additional symmetry as is shown in the following result .",
    "let @xmath12 and @xmath77 be lissajous knots with frequencies @xmath117 and phase shifts @xmath33 and @xmath118 respectively . if @xmath33 and @xmath118 are symmetric with respect to the point @xmath119 or the point @xmath120 then @xmath12 and @xmath77 are equivalent .",

    ". then @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "thus @xmath123 which is either @xmath46 or its mirror image @xmath124 .",
    "the second case follows similarly",
    ".    we may now prove theorem  [ first bound ] .",
    "* proof of theorem  [ first bound ] : * the fundamental domain is divided into @xmath24 `` boxes '' of the form + @xmath61\\times[k \\frac{\\pi}{n_x } , ( k+1)\\frac{\\pi}{n_x}]$ ] for @xmath125 . within each box",
    "all the knots have the same type ii crossings and hence by corollary  [ periodicity in box ] there are at most @xmath116 different knot types in that box . since there are @xmath24 boxes we obtain at most @xmath126 different knots .",
    "if @xmath38 there is the additional rotational symmetry in each box given by proposition  [ n_x=2 symmetry ] .",
    "the center of each box either lies on a slanted singular line , or midway between two such lines",
    ". moreover , one of the two boxes will be one way and the other box will be the other way .",
    "there are at most @xmath25 knot types in the box where the center of the box lies on a singular line , and there are at most @xmath127 knot types in the box otherwise .",
    "thus there are at most @xmath128 knot types in total .",
    "our results thus far allow us to efficiently sample all lissajous knots with a given set of frequencies @xmath78 .",
    "we can easily pick one set of phase shifts from each region on the phase torus and corollary  [ periodicity in box ] , and proposition  [ n_x=2 symmetry ] in the case when @xmath38 , allows us to further restrict the regions that we must sample .",
    "however , once @xmath1 , and @xmath129 are given , the @xmath42-projection has been fixed and it is natural to ask if all possible choices for @xmath2 are necessary .",
    "theorem  [ periodicity in n_z ] , which is stated in the introduction , shows that in fact , only a finite number of values for @xmath2 are needed to produce all possible knots .",
    "* proof of theorem  [ periodicity in n_z ] : * suppose that @xmath67 , @xmath130 and that both knots have the same phase shifts",
    ". we will show first that each knot has its type ii crossings arranged the same way .",
    "let @xmath47 be a type ii crossing with parameters @xmath82 and let @xmath131 be the height difference between the two points on the knot directly above the crossing .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath132 thus if @xmath2 is increased by @xmath133 , not only do all type ii crossings remain unchanged , they each maintain the same height difference between upper and lower strand .",
    "we now shift our focus to type i crossings .",
    "let @xmath12 have phase shifts @xmath134 and choose @xmath101 small enough so that @xmath12 corresponds to the region just below the singular line @xmath135 .",
    "let @xmath77 correspond to the `` same '' region , that is , let @xmath77 have phase shifts @xmath136 . as before ,",
    "let @xmath47 be a type i crossing with parameters @xmath82 and let @xmath137 be the height difference between the two points on the knot directly above the crossing .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath138 thus @xmath12 and @xmath77 are the same knot since both the type i and type ii crossings are arranged the same way in each .",
    "if the phase shifts for @xmath12 are now changed by moving into an adjacent region , and if the phase shifts for @xmath77 are changed in the same way , then the same set of crossings is changed for both @xmath12 and @xmath77 and hence @xmath12 and @xmath77 remain the same knot .",
    "therefore @xmath139    according to corollary  [ periodicity in box ] , the pattern of knot types in each square @xmath140\\times[k\\pi / n_x , ( k+1)\\pi / n_x]$ ] , as we move from the upper left corner to the lower right corner , is periodic with period @xmath113 .",
    "thus if each box contains at least @xmath113 regions the inclusion in ( [ inclusion ] ) is equality . now",
    "the distance between successive singular lines of the type given in equation  [ type i singular lines ] is @xmath141 and the distance between lines of slope @xmath142 containing opposite corners of the square is @xmath143 .",
    "thus there are at least @xmath144 regions in each square . hence the inclusion in ( [ inclusion ] ) is equality if @xmath145 it is easy to check that this is true if @xmath146 .",
    "for relatively prime integers @xmath24 and @xmath25 let @xmath147 .",
    "[ second bound ] let @xmath148 be relatively prime integers . then @xmath149 if furthermore @xmath38 , then @xmath150    for fixed",
    "@xmath148 we need only consider @xmath151 consecutive values of @xmath2 . to count the number of values that are relatively prime to both @xmath24 and @xmath25 we first subtract @xmath116 multiples of @xmath24 that lie in that range as well as @xmath152 multiples of @xmath25 and then add back in the 2 multiples of @xmath153 .",
    "thus the number of possible values of @xmath2 is bounded above by @xmath154 and applying theorem [ first bound ] yields the result .",
    "the phase torus of a fourier-@xmath10 is , in general , @xmath155 dimensional although we may set any one phase shift equal to zero and drop to a @xmath156 dimension space .",
    "if @xmath157 , @xmath32 and we fix @xmath129 , then we may again think of the 2-dimensional phase torus associated to the pair @xmath158 .",
    "the singular curves are now much more complicated than in the lissajous case , but can still be carefully described .",
    "suppose @xmath12 is a fourier-@xmath11 knot with parameterization @xmath159    note that by rescaling we may assume that three of the four amplitudes are @xmath160 .    in the lissajous case",
    ", we require that the three frequencies be pairwise relatively prime . the same proof ( see @xcite ) can be used now to conclude that the three integers @xmath1 and @xmath161 must be pairwise relatively prime .",
    "this rules out several of the 16 cases that arise by considering all possible parities for the frequencies . some of the remaining cases still give rise to highly symmetric knots , such as when all the frequencies are odd . in this case",
    "the knot is strongly plus amphicheiral just as in the lissajous setting .",
    "but some of the parity cases produce knots with no apparent symmetry , suggesting that the set of fourier-@xmath11 is much richer than the set of lissajous knots .",
    "we will not undertake an exhaustive analysis of the phase torus of fourier-@xmath11 knots .",
    "instead we offer a glimpse of the situation in the following proposition which could be stated much more precisely .",
    "in particular , the constants in the statement of the proposition all depend on the pair of indices @xmath82 associated to either a type i or ii crossing .",
    "the interested reader can easily determine the constants by going through the details of the proof .",
    "results analogous to propositions  [ crossing diagonal ] and [ n_x=2 symmetry ] seem much harder .",
    "let @xmath12 be a fourier-@xmath11 knot with parameterization as given in [ fourier112 parameterization ] .",
    "then the singular curves on the phase torus are of four possible types :    1 .   lines of the form @xmath162 , 2",
    ".   lines of the form @xmath163 , 3 .",
    "lines of the form @xmath164 , 4 .",

    "then @xmath172 and the crossing is singular if @xmath173 we are now led to several cases .    * case i : @xmath174 * + if @xmath25 divides @xmath175 then we must have that @xmath176 since @xmath177 and @xmath178 and @xmath179 can not have a common factor .",
    "this means that @xmath180 for some integer @xmath99 .",
    "* case ii : @xmath181 * + this is similar to case i leading to @xmath182 for some integer @xmath99 .",

    "proceeding in a fashion similar to that given on pages 300303 in @xcite , we obtain that @xmath44 is given by the continued fraction @xmath201=\\eta_1+\\cfrac{1}{\\varepsilon_1 ^ 1+\\varepsilon_1 ^ 2 + \\cfrac{1}{\\eta_2+\\dots + \\cfrac{1}{\\eta_{n_y } } } } \\ ] ] note that if @xmath12 is lissajous then it is rotationally symmetric with respect to the @xmath57-axis and each pair of type ii crossings has the same sign . in this case",
    "each @xmath202 can be replaced with @xmath203 . using this formula ,",
    "it is easy to determine the 2-bridge knot given by a fourier-@xmath11 representation with @xmath38 .",
    "hence , when we sample lissajous and fourier-@xmath11 knots with @xmath38 , even if we obtain knots with hundreds of crossings , it is a simple matter to distinguish them .",
    "since every lissajous knot with @xmath38 is 2-bridge , a good question is : what 2-bridge knots are lissajous with @xmath38 ?",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , every lissajous knot is either strongly plus amphicheiral , or 2-periodic and linking its axis of rotation once .",
    "it is known that a 2-bridge knot can not be strongly plus amphicheiral @xcite .",
    "it is also known ( and will be shown below ) that every 2-bridge knot is 2-periodic , but may or may not link its axis of rotation once .",
    "the following theorem makes it easy to identify which 2-bridge knots _ might _ be lissajous .",
    "let @xmath12 be a 2-bridge knot .",
    "then the following are equivalent .",
    "\\1 ) @xmath12 has a symmetry of period 2 with axis @xmath204 such that @xmath204 is disjoint from @xmath12 and @xmath205    \\2 ) @xmath206 is a square mod 2    \\3 ) @xmath207 1 mod 2 .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , it follows from a result of murasugi ( see @xcite ) that 1 ) implies 2 ) and clearly 3 ) implies 2 ) .",
    "we must show that 2 ) implies both 1 ) and 3 ) .",
    "suppose @xmath12 is a 2-bridge knot given by the pair of relatively prime integers @xmath191 with @xmath192 odd and @xmath193 .",
    "there is a unique continued fraction expansion @xmath208\\ ] ] where each of the partial quotients @xmath209 is even .",
    "corresponding to this expansion is a seifert surface made from plumbing together twisted bands as shown in figure  [ plumbed bands ] .",
    "notice that the seifert surface , and hence @xmath12 is rotationally symmetric around the axis @xmath204 . thus every 2-bridge knot has a symmetry of period 2 with axis disjoint from the knot .",
    "however , the linking number of @xmath204 and @xmath12 need not be @xmath210 in general . from the plumbing picture",
    "we also see that the number of bands , @xmath211 , must be even in order to get a knot .",
    "if @xmath211 is odd we obtain a 2-bridge link ( of two components ) .",
    "the axis @xmath204 meets the seifert surface @xmath212 transversely in @xmath213 points and we may compute the linking number of @xmath204 and @xmath12 by counting the signed intersection points . let @xmath214 be the sign of the intersection point that occurs between band @xmath215 and @xmath216 .",
    "let @xmath217 be the sign of the left - most intersection point in the figure and choose orientations so that @xmath218 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath219 if @xmath220 is odd and @xmath221 if @xmath220 is even .",
    "thus the sequence @xmath222 determines the sequence @xmath223 which in turn determines the linking number between @xmath204 and @xmath12 .    from the seifert surface we may obtain the seifert matrix @xmath224 and compute the conway polynomial @xmath225 .",
    "it is a straightforward calculation to show that @xmath226 ( see page 207 of @xcite . )    if @xmath227 the conway polynomial is @xmath228 and the alexander polynomial @xmath229 . in general ,",
    "an alexander polynomial of the form @xmath230 is a square mod 2 if and only if @xmath231 mod 2 for @xmath232 .",
    "thus @xmath233 is a square mod 2 if and only if at least one of @xmath234 or @xmath235 is even .",
    "but if this is the case it follows that @xmath236 .",
    "it is also true that @xmath233 is a square mod 2 if and only if it is equal to 1 mod 2 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath237 and that @xmath12 is a knot with @xmath238 a square mod 2 .",
    "the first thing to show is that @xmath220 is even for at least one value of @xmath215 .",
    "if @xmath220 were odd for every @xmath215 , then replace each @xmath220 with @xmath239 . this does not change any @xmath220 mod 2 , and hence does not change @xmath240 mod 2 or @xmath238 mod 2 .",
    "but if @xmath241 for all @xmath215 , we can prove by induction on @xmath211 that @xmath242 and it follows that @xmath243 is not a square mod 2 .",
    "thus at least one @xmath220 is even . replacing this @xmath220 with zero transforms @xmath12 into a knot @xmath244 with the same alexander polynomial mod 2 but with a seifert surface having two fewer bands .",
    "proceeding by induction on the number of bands , we have that lk@xmath245 . but",
    "now because @xmath220 is even , @xmath12 must also link @xmath204 once . if we begin instead with the assumption that @xmath246 mod 2 , the same argument will work .",
    "using the results of sections  [ lissajous phase torus ] we are now in a position to efficiently sample lissajous knots . in the case where @xmath38 we obtain 2-bridge knots and can take advantage of this to compare knots in our sample .",
    "for the more general case of fourier knots , we have not carried out a complete analysis of the phase torus , a task that seems much more difficult .",
    "hence , we have not attempted to rigorously sample fourier knots , but instead have relied on two methods , either random sampling or an algorithm which first `` draws '' a bitmap image of the phase torus ( as in figure  [ 5612phasetorus ] ) and then picks one point from each `` white '' region .",
    "this latter approach is fraught with difficulty since , for example , some white regions may be smaller than a single pixel and be missed .",
    "our samples naturally fall into four cases which we describe in turn in this section .",
    "we have determined all knots in @xmath248 for @xmath249 . for a given value of @xmath25",
    "we let @xmath2 run from @xmath250 to @xmath251 .",
    "these values of @xmath2 are sufficient to guarantee that we obtain all possible knots in @xmath248 . since each of these knots is 2-bridge we were able to use equation  [ continued fraction ] to identify the associated pair @xmath191 and thus compare knots in the output .",
    "the total number of knots in @xmath248 is given in table  [ size of l(2,n_y ) ] for each value of @xmath25 .",
    "it is interesting to compare these numbers with the upper bound given by theorem  [ second bound ] .",
    "depending on @xmath25 , the actual number of knots found is roughly between 5 and 10 per cent of the upper bound .",
    "the discrepancy is almost certainly due to the presence of huge numbers of unknots .",
    "the @xmath42-projection of a lissajous knot with @xmath38 and @xmath252 has @xmath253 crossings , and knots in @xmath254 have crossing numbers ranging from 5 to 293 .",
    "of course the bound of 78008 given by theorem  [ second bound ] for @xmath38 and @xmath252 is well below the upper bound of @xmath255 obtained by considering all possible crossing arrangements !"
