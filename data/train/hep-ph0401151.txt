    "many experiments are currently under way aiming at the direct detection of wimp . in fact the dama experiment  @xcite has claimed the observation of such events , which with better statistics have subsequently been interpreted as a modulation signal @xcite . these data , however , are not consistent with other recent experiments , see e.g. edelweiss @xcite and cdms @xcite .",

    "the event rates , however , are expected to be quite low and the nuclear recoil energies are extremely small .",
    "thus one has to try to reduce the background to the lowest possible level and understand possible reaction induced backgrounds(for a brief discussion see the appendix at the end of the paper ) .",
    "furthermore one has to search for characteristic signatures associated with this reaction .",
    "examples are the modulation of the event rates with the motion of the earth ( modulation effect ) and the correlation of the observed rates of directionally sensitive experiments with the motion of the sun @xcite",
    ". transitions to low energy excited nuclear states have also been considered @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we will explore another novel possibility , namely detecting dark matter constituents by observing the low energy electrons , which follow the ionization of the atom during the lsp - nucleus collision .",
    "this possibility may be realized with the technology of gaseous tpc detectors @xcite .",
    "in fact the wimp - nucleus scattering leads : ( i ) the nuclear recoil and ( ii ) to nuclear recoil with atomic excitation .",
    "so far most cdm searches have been made by the inclusive processes , ( i ) and ( ii ) , employing solid detectors .",
    "we propose that the produced electrons in atomic excitation ( ii ) should be studied by exclusive measurements .",

    "the thus obtained branching ratios are independent of all parameters of supersymmetry except the neutralino mass .",
    "the numerical results given here apply in the case of the coherent mode . if , however , we limit ourselves to the ratios of the relevant cross sections , we do not expect substantial changes in the case of the spin induced process . with these ingredients",
    "we find that the ratio of the cross section with ionization divided by that of the standard neutralino - nucleus elastic scattering , nuclear recoil experiments ( nrec ) , takes the form : & = & _",

    "the outgoing electron energy lies in the range @xmath18 .",
    "the expression for the standard cross section @xmath19 will be given below ( eq . [ slsp ] ) .",
    "since the momentum of the outgoing electron is much smaller than the momentum of the oncoming neutralino , i.e. @xmath20 , the integration over @xmath21 can be trivially performed .",

    ". [ ratio2 ] otherwise the angular integrations can only be done numerically . furthermore integrating numerically the above expression over the electron spectrum we obtain the total cross section .",
    "one , of course , must convolute the above expression with the velocity distribution ( see next section ) to obtain both the differential rate as well the total rate as a function of the neutralino mass . before proceeding",
    "further we will give an estimate of the expected standard elastic scattering recoil coherent events .",

    "[ results ] ) .",
    "we must begin by emphasizing that the standard dark matter experiments have thus far consisted of inclusive measurements employing solid detectors , where the electrons and the recoil nuclei have not been separated .",
    "these measure continuum energy spectra of the recoiling nuclei with an energy resolution , which is not very good .",
    "most experiments are employing neutrons with energy in the range of @xmath34 mev with a resolution of a few @xmath35 mev , which is much larger than the electron energy .",
    "then the electron contribution is hidden .",
    "the present paper is concerned with an exclusive measurement , whereby the electron signal is separated from the nuclear recoil signal .",
    "the electron rate is about @xmath36 of the nuclear recoil rate .",
    "the actual nuclear recoil rate is reduced by about @xmath37 depending the detector ienergy cutoff .",
    "it thus appears that the electron rate could be as high as @xmath38 of the nuclear recoil rate .",
    "this makes it a realistic proposal , if the bg problems are under control .",
    "the nice feature of an exclusive experiment is that one can measure simultaneously the electrons and the nuclear recoils , substantially reducing this way the bg rate .    to circumvent the bg problems one must use high purity materials and run the experiment underground .",
    "the main source of background is neutrons and this applies both in the standard experiments as well as the present novel proposal .",
    "it thus appears that background events of primary concern to the present work can arise from two main sources :    1 .",
    "reaction induced auger electrons .",
    "these can arise from the decay of the inner electron holes in the daughter atom .",
    "the decay width has been estimated to be @xmath39kev for @xmath25ne .",
    "these electrons can have energies in the region of interest . in the case of @xmath25ne",
    "they are expected at energies of @xmath40 and @xmath41 depending on which two electrons fill this hole and produce the auger electron @xcite .",
    "the reaction induced 1s holes , however , occur with a small probability , see fig .",
    "[ dnof - f ] one may also have background electrons , produced from impurities which may lead to betas and photoelectrons producing @xmath42 rays .",
    "anyway it has been estimated that such a background is under control @xcite .",
    "2 .   radioactive impurities ( ri ) . ri s give rise to @xmath43 bg s .",
    "as it is well known , recent recoil detectors can separate the recoil signal from electron backgrounds of ri @xmath44 s . similarly the electron tracking detectors select electron signals .",
    "it is quite realistic , as shown both in the recent solar @xmath45 detectors and the planned @xmath46 experiments , to build detectors at the level of ppt of u - th impurities ( ppt@xmath47 ) .",
    "note that most ri bg s deposit @xmath44 energies at multi - sites .",
    "then the bg rate for the electron detectors with impurities at the level of a few ppt is estimated at @xmath48 per year per ton , by a stringent selection of dm single - site signals from the ri multi - site events .",
    "this is orders of magnitude less than the present limit ( @xmath49/year / kg ) of the wimp s .",
    "it should also be noted that this limit is 2 - 3 orders of magnitude less than the electron signal rates ( @xmath50 per year per ton ) and the electron bg rates of the planned electron detectors for real time solar p - p @xmath45 s and @xmath46 experiments . in any case",
    "it seems feasible to build detectors with bg rates well below the the signal rates with @xmath51pb .",
    "furthermore since the electron energy signal is always accompanied by the recoil signal , the coincidence measurement of both the electron tracks and and the recoil signals will make this experiment almost free from bg events .",
    "electron backgrounds due to ri .",
    "these are under control @xcite .",
    "most electrons from ri s are @xmath52 rays followed by @xmath42 rays and compton electrons followed by compton @xmath42 rays . these deposit energy at multi - sites and , thus",
    ", they can be eliminated by selecting the single - site event from wimp s . with a purity level of the order of @xmath53bq per kg",
    "one gets a bg event rate of less than @xmath35 per year per kg , after a stringent signal selection .",
    "this is far below the present wimp signal rate ( @xmath49 per y per kg ) .",
    "4 .   neutron induced events .",
    "this source is also present in the standard nuclear recoil experiments and it should be dealt with in both .",
    "such neutron events can be deciphered by studying the reaction products . we will , however , estimate the event rate due to neutrons using the distribution for muon produced neutrons given at 2000 m w.e . by gaitskell @xcite . *",
    "neutron electron scattering due to the neutron magnetic dipole moment .",
    "+ this process is very special in the sense that the electron interacts directly with the neutron .",
    "thus the magnetic moment interaction does not suffer from suppression at high electron energies due to the bound electron form factor , see figs [ dnecross]- [ dnerate ] obtained as discussed in the appendix . *",
    "electron ionization due to neutron - nucleus elastic scattering .",
    "+ this process is characterized by kinematics similar to the reaction we are interested in . for the model discussed in the appendix involving a yukawa interaction ,",
    "[ yukpot ] , we obtain the results shown in figs [ yuknn1]-[yuknn2 ] .",
    "+ it appears that both of these backgrounds yield rates that could be troublesome . in practice the rate gets smaller by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude at typical underground labs with 4000 - 6000 m w.e .",
    "active neutron shields for incoming and outgoing neutrons reduce further the bg rate . accordingly",
    "the bg rate due to the neutrons can be negligibly small in realistic cases .",
    "these bg problems are further discussed in the appendix .",
    "we will now apply the above formalism for a typical case , namely @xmath54 .",
    "we will employ a maxwell - boltzmann lsp velocity distribution with respect to the galactic center @xcite , namely : f(*v*)=e^-(v^2/v_0 ^ 2 ) , [ mbgc ] with @xmath55 . on this",
    "we impose by hand an upper velocity bound ( escape velocity ) , @xmath56 .",
    "we then transform this distribution to the lab frame , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the velocity of the sun around the center of the galaxy .",
    "we will not be concerned here with the motion of the the earth around the sun , i.e. the modulation effect @xcite .",
    "folding both the numerator and the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ ratio1 ] ) with the lsp velocity distribution , after multiplying each with the lsp flux @xmath59 , we obtain the differential ratio @xmath60 , with @xmath61 the rate for ionization .",
    "if we then integrate the final expression with respect to the electron energy , we obtain the ratio @xmath62 . by doing the same in the case of eq .",
    "( [ ratio2 ] ) , we obtain the analogous ratios @xmath63 and @xmath64 , associated with the case without nuclear form factor .",
    "we will apply our results on a light target , e.g. @xmath65f , which is considered in the standard nuclear recoil experiments .",
    "the obtained results are essentially identical to those for @xmath25ne , which is a popular gaseous tpc counter currently being considered for detection of low energy neutrinos produced in triton decay .",
    "our approach can , of course , also be applied in the case of the heavier targets , employed in current dark matter searches , but the atomic physics involved is much more complicated    the radial functions @xmath66 will be given in terms of a dimensionless variable @xmath67 , by writing @xmath68 , with @xmath69 given by : r^2_1s= , [ rad1 ] r^2_2s=  ,   r^2_2p= .",

    "[ nof - f ] we show the same quantity taking all orbitals together .",
    "these results were obtained considering one electron per atom and weighing each orbit with the probabilities @xmath11 : p_n=(2/10,2/10,6/10 ) .",

    "[ cnof - f ] , as a function of the low energy detector cut - off ( threshold ) . from this plot",
    "we see that the introduction of the nuclear form factor , which we view as quite reliable @xcite , does not substantially alter the branching ratio .",
    "this trend for the branching ratio may persist even for heavier nuclei , even though the individual rates may depend on the assumed form factor . from these plots we see that , even though the differential rate peaks at low energies , there remains substantial strength above the electron energy of @xmath70 , which is the threshold energy used in micromegas detectors , like the one recently @xcite proposed .",
    "based on our results summarized in the previous section one can be optimistic about using the emitted electrons in the neutralino nucleus collisions for the direct detection of the lsp .",
    "this novel process may be exploited by the planned tpc low energy electron detectors . by achieving low energy thresholds of about @xmath71 ,",
    "the branching ratios are approximately 10 percent",
    ". they can be even larger , if one includes low energy cutoffs imposed by the detectors in the standard experiments , not included in the above estimate .    as we have seen the background problems associated with the proposed mechanism are not worse than those entering the standard experiments . in any case coincidence experiments with x - rays ,",
