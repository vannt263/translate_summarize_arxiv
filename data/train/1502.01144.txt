    ", measure the dynamical complexity of @xmath3 .",
    "letting @xmath3 run through the group of birational transformations of @xmath0 gives the dynamical spectrum @xmath8 which is a birational invariant .",
    "we are interested in how properties of @xmath9 may reflect geometric properties of @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , it is an interesting question whether the dynamical spectrum may even carry enough information to distinguish between ( conjecturally irrational ) very general smooth cubic hypersurfaces @xmath10 and projective @xmath1-space @xmath11 itself ( for @xmath12 ) .",
    "the spectrum does `` see '' rationality in dimension @xmath13 : if @xmath14 is an irrational surface , then @xmath15 is discrete , whereas for rational @xmath14 the spectrum has accumulation points from below and , in fact , infinite cantor - bendixson rank ( the accumulation points accumulate again , and so forth ad infinitum ) .",
    "another instance which shows that @xmath16 is closely connected with rationality is the following result : if for a projective @xmath1-fold @xmath0 there exists a birational self - map @xmath3 with a tuple of dynamical degrees such that any two consecutive @xmath4 are distinct , then @xmath0 has kodaira dimension @xmath17 or @xmath18 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "from now on , let @xmath19 be a very general smooth cubic fourfold , and denote by @xmath20 the subgroup generated by reflections @xmath21 in points @xmath22 . in this article we will try to obtain some constraints for the tuples of dynamical degrees @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "our goal here is to compute the dynamical degrees of many elements in @xmath25 to get a feeling as to which ones can be realized on a very general cubic .",
    "our main results can be summarised as     [ tmain ] let @xmath19 be a very general smooth cubic fourfold .    * for a general @xmath26-tuple of points on @xmath19 , @xmath27 , the dynamical degrees of the composition of the reflections in these points are @xmath28 .",
    "* consider a general line @xmath29 on @xmath19 and a general plane section of @xmath19 through @xmath29 , which then decomposes as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a conic .",
    "pick general points @xmath32 and @xmath33 . if @xmath34 , then @xmath35 . * if @xmath36 are the vertices of a triangle of lines on @xmath19 and @xmath34 , then @xmath37 .",
    "we have not computed @xmath38 in the last two cases of the theorem yet , but see remark [ rsecond ] for some comments about the computations of @xmath38 in case ( 2 ) .",
    "let us now briefly describe a potential  ansatz \" to prove irrationality of a very general cubic fourfold @xmath19 : prove constraints for the dynamical degrees on @xmath19 and show that these constraints are violated on @xmath39 by constructing an example ; note that for many examples of cremona transformations , e.g. monomial ones @xcite , the dynamical degrees are readily computable .",
    "these constraints could either be of an arithmetic nature , for example , which algebraic number fields the @xmath40 lie in , or consist of new inequalities , for example , bounds for the size of the ratio @xmath41 .",
    "note , that there exist birational self - maps with interesting multi - degrees , but uninteresting dynamical degrees .",
    "indeed , pan in @xcite and @xcite constructed birational self - maps of @xmath42 of all bidegrees allowed by the hodge and cremona inequalities ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "7.1.7 & rem .",
    "7.1.8 ) ) just by considering de jonquieres maps , i.e. maps extended from @xmath43 and preserving a linear fibration on @xmath42 .",
    "however , the dynamical degrees of these have @xmath44 by @xcite . therefore , to prove constraints one will presumably have to work with all iterates of a given birational map @xmath3 and not only a sufficiently high power of @xmath3 .",
    "this approach to distinguishing rational from irrational varieties ties in well with the old philosophy that varieties closer to rational ones should admit more or `` wilder '' birational self - maps ; this goes back to the work on birational rigidity of iskovskikh - manin @xcite , see also the book by pukhlikov @xcite for lots of developments in this direction .",
    "the main new point of view here is that we propose the dynamical spectrum as a means to _ measure the size _ of @xmath45 , or in other words , to quantify its  wildness \" .",
    "this means we want to use _ quantitative differences _ ( the dynamical spectrum ) instead of only qualitative ones .",
    "compare this with the fact that in the recent article @xcite the authors prove that @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where @xmath0 is a cubic threefold , are very much alike in several qualitative aspects .",
    "for instance , in both one can find birational self - maps contracting surfaces birational to any given birational type of a ruled surface .",
    "but there are examples of two varieties where in each case the birational automorphism group contains elements contracting subvarieties of uncountably many birational types , but whose dynamical spectra can be seen to be distinct .",
    "for instance , one can take @xmath48 and @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath0 a surface of general type without rational curves , hence no non - constant maps @xmath51 . since every rational map @xmath51 is constant",

    "@xmath640 .",
    "the claim , however , follows directly from two facts : ( 1 ) the tangent divisors @xmath635 are invariant under all three reflections since any two points lie on a line ; ( 2 ) by the formulas in lemmas [ lmatrices ] and [ ldynamicscurvetraits ] , every trait @xmath630 has center in the plane after application of @xmath641 ( a priori , it might get  pushed outside \" again in case it passes through @xmath279 when @xmath242 is the next transformation to be applied ) .",
