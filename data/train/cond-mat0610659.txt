    "<S> , we mention atom wires that were recently created on a si(553)-au surface and which featured vacancy - like defects that were manipulated with an stm tip @xcite . once it is recognized that impurities can be manipulated , one can ask new questions in which they appear as main actors . for example , what is the interaction between impurities which is mediated by the quantum liquid of fermions ? </S>",
    "<S> this problem was recently addressed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that when the impurities are far apart they behave like acoustic mirrors and interact via a casimir - like force . </S>",
    "<S> this is the expected behavior for any system whose low energy properties are described in terms of phonons . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the special case of non - interacting fermions , the calculation can be done exactly and it was shown that this interaction features oscillations as a function of the impurities separation @xcite . in the present paper  </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , this is a quite remarkable situation . </S>",
    "<S> here we have a casimir force whose strength and sign can be tuned by the impurities separation . in order to investigate that problem </S>",

    "<S> the interaction between the impurities  which is mediated by the quantum fluctuations in the liquid  is considered in the adiabatic limit in which changing the distance between the impurities is slow compared to the time the system takes to equilibrate . </S>",
    "<S> within such a limit , the interaction energy directly follows from the groundstate energy . we should stress that we focus on interactions mediated by quantum zero - point fluctuations and not on classical effects due to modification of the average particle density . the latter dominate at short distances of the order of the inter - particle distance and lead to a kind of `` mattress effect '' . for a discussion of the classical ground state energy , </S>",

    "<S> this correspond to a situation of no resonant tunneling ( anti - resonances ) . </S>",
    "<S> the casimir energy has the usual interpretation in terms of phononic `` radiation pressure '' on the impurities : the outer radiation pressure of phonons overcomes the inner one and hence the resulting attraction between the impurities . on the other hand , at a maximum , where @xmath31 , the interaction energy changes sign and becomes positive reaching @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> a physical understanding of this change of sign in the casimir force might be obtained by noting that in a situation of resonant tunneling ( @xmath31 ) , fermions approaching the double barrier structure from outside can tunnel with no reflection . </S>",
    "<S> there is thus no contribution to the radiation pressure due to the phonons in the region outside the impurities . by contrast </S>",
    "<S> , fermions which come from in between the two barriers , have to tunnel through a single impurity and do not benefit from resonant tunneling . at low energies , they are almost perfectly reflected and therefore contribute a positive radiation pressure on the impurities . at resonance therefore , the inner radiation pressure is larger than the outer one , and thus the effective interaction between the impurities is repulsive . in a sense </S>",
    "<S> , this is like having impurities with transmission properties that are not right - left symmetric and makes a connection to imry s idea of tuning the sign of the qed casimir effect using asymmetric mirrors @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we now come to the main point of part ii . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the basic oscillation phenomenon contained in eq  ( [ eq : v12idealres ] ) , and found in part i for non - interacting fermions , remains essentially intact when including interactions between the fermions . in order to study 1d interacting fermions </S>",

    "<S> the luttinger liquid description depends on three parameters : the sound velocity @xmath49 , the luttinger interaction parameter @xmath50 and a cutoff energy @xmath51 above which this effective description breaks down . </S>",
    "<S> repulsive short - range interactions imply @xmath52 . with long - range ( coulomb ) interactions , </S>",
    "<S> the system becomes a 1d wigner crystal , which can be seen as the @xmath53 limit of the luttinger liquid @xcite , but can not be treated within the present formalism . </S>",
    "<S> non - interacting fermions correspond to @xmath54 and @xmath55 . if there is full translational invariance @xmath56 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider , as before , two localized impurities sitting at position @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between the impurities and the luttinger liquid is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a phenomenological scattering amplitude . as the luttinger </S>",

    "<S> the precise relation between the two scattering amplitudes is not generally known . in the renormalization group language , </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenological scattering amplitude @xmath59 is roughly a running scattering amplitude at the energy scale @xmath60 . for simplicity , we consider the symmetric case @xmath61 . inserting the density expansion ( [ density ] ) into the interaction ( [ eq : sidens ] ) gives rise to several different terms . </S>",
    "<S> the first term @xmath62 is just twice the classical energy cost of adding an impurity to the liquid : it does not contribute to the renormalized interaction energy @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the second term due to forward scattering is proportional to @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> this term is often eliminated via a gauge transformation : @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the heaviside step function . </S>",
    "<S> however , this operation is not totally innocent here and forward scattering can not be eliminated : the gauge transformation gives rise to a phase shift @xmath66 in the @xmath67 backscattering term . in the limit of weak impurities </S>",
    "<S> , this phase shift agrees with the one found for non - interacting fermions @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> actually , we expect that the phase shift in the interacting case is given by @xmath69 for _ arbitrary _ impurity strengths , however to our knowledge there are no exact results on this problem . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the precise value of @xmath70 depends on the detailed potential and the behavior of the fermion liquid at high energies where a ll description no longer applies . </S>",
    "<S> this issue is often discussed in the context of the x - ray edge singularity or in the kondo problem and is related to the order in which two non - commuting limits are taken : sending the size of the impurity to zero versus sending the bandwidth to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> when using the luttinger liquid formalism , one automatically takes the second limit first , see ref .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the third term due to @xmath67 backward scattering gives the dominant contribution to the action @xmath71 and , when including the phase shift @xmath70 , appears as @xmath72+\\cos[2\\theta(r)+\\chi])\\ , \\label{cosine}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 and @xmath20 is a phase such that @xmath74 modulo @xmath16 and @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> there are also higher order terms coming from the density harmonics , however their naive scaling dimension shows that they are less relevant and we therefore neglect them . </S>",
    "<S> actually perturbative renormalization group calculations show that @xmath67 backscattering is always relevant as long as @xmath38 while all higher backscattering operators @xmath76 , with @xmath77 , are irrelevant as long as @xmath78 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as we neglect those higher backscattering operators , our model only describes the situation of two impurities in an interacting fermi gas such that @xmath79 .    as a side remark </S>",
    "<S> , we note that there are other ways of coupling impurities to a bosonic bath of oscillators , such as a luttinger liquid . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the context of qed casimir force studies @xcite , the impurities ( mirrors ) are usually taken to couple directly to the density of the photonic field , i.e. @xmath80 rather than @xmath81 would appear in equation  ( [ cosine ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case in particular for the theorem of kenneth and klich on the absence of a repulsive casimir force @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another example was considered in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where only forward scattering was kept , resulting in a mapping to the spin - boson model . </S>",
    "<S> these different models , which all describe two impurities in a bath of quantum oscillators , do not necessarily show the same behavior .    from now on , we shall work with the action @xmath82 with @xmath71 given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cosine ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the partition function is @xmath83 and the integral on the field @xmath84 can be performed everywhere except at the position of the impurities @xmath85 . in this way we are left with an action @xmath86 for the fields @xmath87 </S>",

    "<S> up to an overall normalization factor , the partition function is now given by @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> the partition function gives the free energy @xmath95 , from which the renormalized interaction energy follows : @xmath96 . from the parametric dependance of the action @xmath97 on the phase @xmath20 </S>",
    "<S> , we see that the free energy ( and therefore @xmath21 ) will be @xmath16-periodic in @xmath20 . as @xmath98 , </S>",
    "<S> this means that @xmath21 will have some structure with periodicity @xmath9 in @xmath8 just as for non - interacting fermions . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the interaction energy @xmath21 oscillates as a function of the impurities separation @xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> we first evaluate the partition function using the saddle point approximation . for small @xmath50 and strong impurities @xmath99 , the fields @xmath100 are pinned to the values that minimize @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore expand the cosines around a minimum to quadratic order in the fields . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that terms independent of the fields give an important contribution here . </S>",
    "<S> , were neglected in the simplified calculations of ref .  </S>",

    "<S> the resulting free energy is : @xmath102 as the validity of the saddle point approximation requires that @xmath103 , the renormalized interaction becomes : @xmath104 in the limit of zero temperature @xmath105 , it gives @xmath106 where we used @xmath107 .. ] this result generalizes eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : v12idealres ] ) when interactions between particles are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> it also admits an interpretation as an attractive casimir energy @xmath108  albeit with the true sound velocity @xmath49 replacing the fermi velocity @xmath30  modified by oscillations contained in the term @xmath109 , see figure [ restun ] . </S>",
    "<S> the width of the maxima measured relative to their amplitude is proportional to @xmath50 . therefore the maxima are narrower in the presence of interactions between the particles . </S>",
    "<S> the exact position of the maxima is given by the values of @xmath8 such that @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath110 , and depends on both the impurity strength and the inter - particle interactions through the phase shift @xmath70 . as in the case of non - interacting fermions , this is exactly the condition at which tunneling resonances occur in a luttinger liquid , see the appendix [ tunres ] . at this stage </S>",
    "<S> , it is worth mentioning that there is a mapping of our problem  as given by actions ( [ eq : llaction ] ) and ( [ cosine ] )  on the double - boundary sine - gordon model studied in the context of conformal field theory @xcite . for special values of the luttinger parameter @xmath111 $ ] , where @xmath112 is a strictly positive integer ( the so - called reflectionless points ) , the authors of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite were able to calculate exactly the groundstate energy of this model.\\leq 1/4 $ ] . ] in the limit of strong impurities and for the reflectionless points , it yields the same interaction energy @xmath113 as eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : v12res ] ) .    in order to study what happens for values of @xmath50 close to one , we turn to the self - consistent harmonic approximation ( scha ) , which is just an implementation of feynman s variational principle , see , e.g. , @xcite . expanding the cosines in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cosine ] ) to second order in the fields , we replace the coefficient @xmath114 in front of the quadratic term by a variational parameter @xmath115 . </S>",

    "<S> it is valid as long as @xmath142 , i.e. @xmath143 . in a similar way , we obtain @xmath144 in the regime @xmath145 and @xmath146 for the special case @xmath147 , again provided that @xmath105 . for @xmath145 , the interaction given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : ctcos ] ) still shows friedel oscillations but its envelope does not depend on the inter - impurity distance @xmath8 anymore , which reflects the tendency of the system toward wigner crystallization when @xmath50 goes to zero . </S>",
    "<S> however the validity of this calculation is restricted to small but finite temperature as @xmath142 corresponds to @xmath148 . </S>",

    "<S> the oscillations can be spanned by changing the distance between the impurities and are separated by the average inter - particle distance , i.e. they have the same periodicity as friedel oscillations . </S>",
