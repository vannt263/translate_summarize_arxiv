    "distributed sensor networks provide a platform for many military and civilian applications .",
    "examples include surveillance , monitoring wildlife , or controlling the power grid .",
    "sensor networks built for these applications are intended to solve various problems such as detecting , tracking , classifying , counting , and estimating .",
    "they are also required to adhere to a number of physical constraints including power , bandwidth , latency , and complexity .",
    "much research has been reported on each of these topics over the past two decades . in the field of distributed estimation , for example ,",
    "various estimation problems have been formulated and solved .",
    "many works choose either to optimize a distributed sensor network with respect to energy consumption during transmission @xcite or impose bandwidth constraints and thus focus on designing an optimal quantization strategy for the distributed network @xcite , @xcite .",
    "there are few that involve both constraints ( see @xcite as an example ) .    among research groups working on the problem of distributed estimation",
    ", there are a few dealing with distributed estimation of a field ( a multidimensional function , in general ) @xcite .",
    "since in many real - world applications distributed estimation of a multidimensional function may provide additional information that aids in making a high - fidelity decision or in solving another inference problem , we contribute to this topic by formulating and solving the problem of a parametric field estimation from sparse noisy sensor measurements . distributed target localization is another active area of research @xcite .",
    "an iterative solution to this problem is a second contribution of our work .    in this paper ,",
    "the problem of distributed estimation of a physical field from sensory data collected by a homogeneous sensor network is stated as a maximum likelihood estimation problem .",
    "the physical field is a deterministic function and has a known spatial distribution parameterized by a set of unknown parameters , such as the location of an object generating the field and the strength of the field in the region occupied by the sensors .",
    "sensor observations are distorted by additive white gaussian noise .",
    "prior to transmission , each sensor quantizes its observation to @xmath0 levels .",
    "the quantized data are then communicated over parallel additive white gaussian channels to the fusion center where the unknown parameters of the underlying physical field are estimated .",
    "an iterative expectation - maximization ( em ) algorithm to estimate the unknown parameter is formulated , and a simplified numerical solution involving additional approximations is developed .",
    "the numerical examples illustrate the developed approach for the case of the field modeled as a gaussian bell .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",

    "consider a distributed network of homogeneous sensors monitoring the environment for the presence of a substance or an object .",
    "assume that each substance or object is characterized by a location parameter and by a spatially distributed physical field generated by it .",
    "as an example , a ferromagnetic object can be viewed as a single or a collection of dipoles characterized by a magnetic field that they generate .",
    "this field can be sensed by a network of magnetometers placed in the vicinity of the object .",
    "depending on the design of the magnetometers , they may take measurements of a directional complex valued magnetic field or of the magnitude of the field only .",
    "the field generated by a dipole decays as a function of the inverse cube of the distance to the dipole .",
    "the sensor network does not know a priori the location of the dipole as well as the type and size of the object .",
    "however , the type and size of an object can be associated with the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "examples of other physical fields include ( 1 ) a radioactive field that can be modeled as a stationary spatially distributed poisson field with a two - dimensional intensity function decaying according to the inverse - square law or ( 2 ) a distribution of pollution or chemical fumes that , if stationary , can often be modeled as a gaussian bell .",
