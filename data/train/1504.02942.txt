    "a large amount of physical and biochemical research on circular dna has been carried out over the last fifty years following the first observations that the single stranded dna of coliphage @xmath3x174 was a ring @xcite and the tumor virus dna was in the form of covalently closed circular duplex molecules @xcite . being less degradable than linear dna , circular dna has recently revealed a potential for those biotechnological applications such as assembly of nanotubes which require both rigidity and flexibility of the building blocks @xcite .",
    "bending flexibility of short dna fragments has been appreciated since it was pointed out @xcite that linear molecules of order @xmath1 base pairs ( _ bps _ ) can spontaneously close into circles , even in the absence of proteins , with much higher cyclization probabilities than those predicted by conventional worm like chain models @xcite .",
    "the circularization of a dna fragment causes a bending stress in the loop that may be released by a local untwisting of the double helix with formation of fluctuational bubbles comprising a few transiently broken _ bps _ @xcite .",
    "while bubbles are essential to key biological functions such as replication and transcription of the genetic code @xcite , their length is related to the degree of supercoiling as shown by atomic force microscopy imaging of circular plasmids @xcite .    in general , bending and twisting degrees of freedom are intertwined in dna and their interplay",
    "crucially depends on the molecule size .",
    "recently , short sequences of extra - chromosomal circular dna have been found , both in mouse tissues and human cells , in a range of @xmath4 _ bps _ with length distributions peaked between @xmath5 and @xmath6 _ bps _ @xcite .",
    "these findings lend support to the prediction that there should be a minimum size for the existence of double stranded loops whereas , below that size , circular molecules can be only single stranded @xcite .",
    "however , the determination of such threshold is still an open question also in view of the fact that duplex dna minicircles have been obtained , by a modified ligase - assisted protocol @xcite , even in the @xmath7 _ bps _ range .    specifically in the latter ,",
    "disruptions of the regular helical structure have been detected by single - strand - specific endonuclease experiments carried out on dna minicircles with various radii @xcite .",
    "such local disruptions may appear either in the form of kinks which move one base pair out of the stack @xcite or as a breaking of a few base pair hydrogen bonds @xcite , the latter event being energetically more costly .",
    "these issues have been attacked by a theoretical model based on the path integral formalism @xcite and applied to three minicircles having comparable relative contents of at- and gc-_bps _ , albeit with different radii @xcite : analysis of the bubble profiles has shown that base pair disruptions and helix unwinding are in fact more pronounced in the smallest minicircle with @xmath8 _ bps _ ( corresponding to a bending angle of @xmath9 ) while larger loops are relatively stabler . whereas these findings confirm",
    "the soundness of the path integral method , it is still unsettled whether a critical radius of curvature for the appearance of _ bps _ disruptions in small circles indeed exists and to which extent such critical value may depend on the dna sequence specificities .    to shed light on these issues we investigate in this work the thermodynamical stability of a broader set of molecules spanning the range between 20 and 140 _ bps_. in view of the shortness of these systems we assume that , for any given length , the cyclization occurs with finite probability and the molecules are thus in the circular form @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we admit that the minicircles could be found either in the single or in the double stranded helicoidal configuration , keeping the model general enough to deal with both cases . for each minicircle size , we simulate a large ensemble of possible twist configurations and compute the free energy profiles as a function of the average helical repeat , i.e. the number of _ bps _ per helix turn .",
    "this methods permits to determine the energetically most convenient helicoidal conformation for a molecule that , by virtue of the circularization process , has incorporated a certain amount of bending stress .",
    "in general , the quantum statistical partition function of a system is determined by performing an analytic continuation of the quantum mechanical partition function to the imaginary time @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the real time @xcite .",
    "@xmath12 is defined within a range whose upper bound is given by the inverse temperature as in the matsubara method @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the euclidean action takes the place of the mechanical canonical action and , in the path integral formalism @xcite , the statistical partition function is an integral in the configuration space over ( closed ) paths running along an imaginary time axis .",
    "the largest contribution to the statistical partition function comes from those trajectories for which the sum of the kinetic and potential energy is small .",
    "the classical partition function is obtained by replacing the quantum thermal wavelength with the classical one as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the focus of our investigation is a system made of a homogeneous set of @xmath0 free purine - pyrimidine _ bps _ with reduced mass @xmath13 .",
    "let s define @xmath14 as the inter - strand fluctuational vector describing the dynamics of the stretching mode for the @xmath15 base pair .",
    "the application of the path integral method to our classical system relies on the idea that , at finite temperature , the base pair displacements can be thought of as trajectories , @xmath16 :    @xmath17 \\ , , \\label{eq:005}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath20 is the temperature .",
    "as the trajectories are closed , @xmath21 , they can be expanded in fourier series :    @xmath22 \\ , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\omega_m = \\ , \\frac{2 m \\pi}{\\beta } \\ , .",

    "hence , eq .  ( [ eq:001 ] ) sets the zero for the free energy , @xmath29 , of the system .",
    "next , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , we uniformly arrange the @xmath0 objects ( represented by the blue points ) on a circle , with radius @xmath30 , which represents the bent molecule axis",
    ". the @xmath15 object can fluctuate with respect to @xmath30 and its vector ( @xmath14 ) describes a ( red shaded ) orbit lying on a plane which is bent by @xmath31 with respect to the @xmath32 plane . in the local reference system , centered in @xmath33 ,",
    "the @xmath15 object makes a positive twist angle ( @xmath34 ) with respect to the @xmath35 axis and adjacent objects along the stack are twisted by a constant angle .",
    "the rise distance between neighbor objects along the circumference is : @xmath36 .",
    "thus we have built a circular model for a set of particles arranged in a helicoidal conformation .",
    "the model can be applied to both a single stranded and a double stranded molecule . in the former case , @xmath14 represents the @xmath15 base along the strand . in the latter , @xmath14 is the inter - strand fluctuational vector , for the @xmath15 base pair , with respect to the equilibrium position which corresponds to the minimum for the hydrogen bond potential ( see below ) . in the following",
    "we will refer to a set of @xmath0 _ bps _ with the caveat that very short circular molecules may more likely be found in the single strand configuration .",
    "the values @xmath37 and @xmath38 peculiar of dna molecules are hereafter taken .    accordingly , with respect to the * o * reference system ( see fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) , the general vector @xmath39 for the @xmath15 base pair is :    @xmath40    the @xmath41-axis is normal to the sheet plane and @xmath30 lies on the @xmath42 plane . for small size molecules ,",
    "it can be reasonably assumed that the relative bending between adjacent orbital planes along the stack is constant and depends only on the circle length .",
    "then , the bending angle is , @xmath43 , while the twisting is measured by , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the number of _ bps _ per helix turn @xcite . the computation sums over a distribution of @xmath46 and @xmath47 in order to avoid to pin the first base pair in the sequence to a specific angular position .",
    "furthermore , as the molecule axis lies on a plane , the writhe ( measuring the spatial coiling of the axis itself @xcite ) vanishes and the integer linking number ( @xmath48 ) for the closed - circular molecule coincides with the twist number @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the latter is given by @xmath50 which , however , is generally not an integer .",
    "while in long molecules one can take @xmath48 as the closest integer to @xmath51 , the extra twist required to join the strand ends becomes large in short sequences thus significantly reducing the cyclization probability @xcite .",
    "accordingly , as @xmath45 is here a variable , we assume to deal with closed - circular molecules only if @xmath51 is an integer and , in these cases , also closure conditions on the radial fluctuations are implemented in the computation , @xmath52 .",
    "whenever such conditions are not fulfilled , our circular molecules are open .    as the efficacy of the method crucially depends on the partition of the @xmath49 range",
    ", we take a small incremental step , @xmath53 , so that any molecule may assume in principle a large ensemble of possible twisted conformations , each with a specific @xmath45 . the computational task",
    "consists in evaluating the free energy profiles within a broad range of @xmath45 values .",

    "takes the equilibrium state with the largest helical repeat , @xmath82 , suggesting that the helix unwinding is more pronounced in small size molecules where the bending of the backbone is strong .",
    "importantly , in each panel , the minima for @xmath81 coincide with those for @xmath66 signaling that the molecule unwinding is driven by the bending rather than by the hydrogen bonds , at least at room temperature .",
    "then , the unwinding patterns of single and double stranded circular molecules are similar . on the other hand , the potential in eqs .",

    "this is however a property which should be investigated also for larger circles than those here examined .    instead , for @xmath88",
    ", @xmath45 sharply grows .",
    "this is physically consistent with the fact that short molecules , once bent , have small angles between adjacent _ bps _ along the stack . as a consequence ,",
    "short circular molecules tend to untwist in order to attain an energetic configuration which may efficiently release the bending stress .",
    "furthermore , @xmath51 is generally not an integer indicating that , in the very small size range , circular molecules are unlikely to be found in the closed conformation .    only for the loop with @xmath2 , one single turn of the helix involves all @xmath89 _ bps _ that is , @xmath90 and the bending angle is @xmath91 .",
    "it follows that , in our model , no closed helicoidal molecules can be found under such size : a prediction which would be interesting to check experimentally .",
    "the helical repeats selected in fig .  [ fig:3 ] represent the most probable twist conformations associated to the deepest minimum in the free energy profiles with multiple wells .",
    "it should be however remarked that thermal effects may transiently drive every molecule out of its deepest well bringing it to one of the energetically close states associated to other @xmath45 values @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "the picture emerging from this path integral computation points to the existence of a critical size of order @xmath1 _ bps _ below which the molecule helix progressively unwinds .",
    "the applied model is based on the actions in eq .",
    "( [ eq:0001 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq:0002a ] ) accounting for the kinetic energy and the stabilizing hydrogen bond potential . a more structured description including",
    "also the intra - strand base pair stacking may certainly refine the predictions for the most probable helical repeat values of specific sequences but it is not expected to change the trend of the results for the helical unwinding versus @xmath0 presented in this work @xcite .",
    "thus , applying a criterion of thermodynamical stability , we have found that the unwinding of small helicoidal circular molecules hosting a uniform distribution of nucleotides is driven by the size of the loop and it is not essentially affected by the sequence specificities .",
    "the helix unwinds in order to release the stress associated to the bending of the molecule backbone .",
    "the equilibrium twist conformations have been determined by minimizing the molecules free energy under the assumption that the bending angle between adjacent base pairs along the stack is constant . for circles larger than those here examined ,",
    "such assumption may not hold and , accordingly , bending fluctuational effects @xcite should be incorporated in the theoretical description .",
    "finally , for short double stranded molecules , a direct computation of the cyclization probabilities in the framework of the path integral method may contribute to clarify whether a threshold size for closed circular conformations indeed exists .",
    "note that the fluctuations free configuration , @xmath92 , defines the zero for the one particle potential @xmath93 $ ] .",
    "one may also consider the fluctuations with respect to the finite inter - strand equilibrium distance : this would change the fluctuation amplitudes and shift the zero for @xmath93 $ ] but it would not change the results which follow from the free energy minimization .        base pair stacking can be implemented in the model , see e.g. @xcite , but , being a two particle potential , this would greatly enhance the computational time . here",
    "i have chosen a much finer ( and time costly ) partition of the @xmath45 axis than in @xcite , dropping the stacking term as it is not essential to the purpose of this work ."
