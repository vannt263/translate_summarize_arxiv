    "in a previous paper@xcite , hereafter cited as i , we studied the tunneling of a spin governed by the hamiltonian = -k_2 j_z^2 + ( k_1 - k_2 ) j_x^2 - g_b , [ ham ] where @xmath1 is a dimensionless spin operator , and @xmath2 .",
    "this hamiltonian is the simplest descriptor of the magnetic properties of the molecule [ ( tacn)@xmath3fe@xmath0o@xmath4(oh)@xmath5@xmath6 ( or just 8 for short ) , with @xmath7 , @xmath8  k , and @xmath9  k @xcite .",
    "interest in this molecule arises because of its rich low temperature magnetic behavior , which include hysteresis at the level of one molecule @xcite , and more recently , the discovery @xcite of an entire lattice of diabolical points @xcite in its magnetic spectrum , a subset of which was predicted to exist earlier @xcite .",
    "it is the latter property that we wish to continue investigating in this paper .    in paper",
    "i , attention was confined to the case where the external magnetic field @xmath10 is along the hard axis @xmath11 . in this case , the classical energy , which may be viewed as the expectation value @xmath12 of the hamiltonian in a spin - coherent state , is symmetric about the @xmath13 plane , and the problem is analogous to that of a massive particle in one dimension in a reflection symmetric double well potential .",
    "it is then natural to consider the tunneling between the symmetrically related states localized in the left- and right - hand wells . in the magnetic case ,",
    "the analogous states are those with predominatly positive and negative values of @xmath14 , at least as long as @xmath15 is not so large as to bring the classical minima very close to the @xmath16 axis .",
    "the surprise is that the tunnel splitting between the ground states oscillates as a function of @xmath15 , vanishing exactly at a series of points .",
    "in fact , the splitting between higher pairs of levels also vanishes at just these points , as noted in i and earlier studies @xcite .",
    "in addition to observing the quenching of ground state tunneling when @xmath17 , however , wernsdorfer and sessoli @xcite also performed experiments with @xmath18 .",
    "the reflection symmetry of the classical energy is now lost , but if the value of @xmath19 is chosen properly , it is possible to bring an excited state in the positive @xmath14 well into approximate degeneracy with the ground state of the negative @xmath14 well .",
    "the new discovery by them is that if @xmath15 is now varied , the tunnel splitting between the degenerate or quasi - degenerate levels again oscillates .",
    "it is theoretically understood that if both @xmath19 and @xmath15 are properly tuned , the splitting vanishes exactly in this case too @xcite .",
    "experimentally , of course , one can never see a perfect zero in the splitting , and wernsdorfer and sessoli only see a minimum in the landau - zener - stckelberg transition rate between the levels in question .",
    "the minima are so deep , however , that there is little doubt that the underlying tunneling matrix element is quenched .    when @xmath17 , the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is invariant under a 180@xmath20 rotation about @xmath11 , and the quenchings can be understood from the viewpoint of the von neumann - wigner theorem as allowed crossings of energy levels with different parities under this rotation .",
    "a similar argument can be made when @xmath21 .",
    "when @xmath10 has both @xmath16 and @xmath22 components , however , the hamiltonian has no obvious symmetry , and the above theorem states that an intersection of two energy levels is infinitely unlikely as a single parameter in the hamiltonian is varied . for a real symmetric hamiltonian , it is known @xcite that one must vary two parameters to obtain an intersection .",
    "since we can choose the matrices of both @xmath14 and @xmath23 to be real in the @xmath14 basis , these two parameters can be taken as @xmath15 and @xmath19 .",
    "the isolated points in the @xmath15-@xmath19 plane where any two levels intersect are precisely what herzberg and longuet - higgins @xcite call conical intersections and what berry and wilkinson @xcite call diabolical points .",
    "the latter terminology originates in the resemblance of the energy surface  a double cone with a common vertex to an italian toy called _ the diavolo_.      in this paper we shall allow @xmath10 to lie in the @xmath24 plane , with a view to studying the tunneling in the asymmetrical well , and locating the diabolical points . as in paper i , our analysis is based on the discrete phase integral ( dpi ) , or wentzel - kramers - brillouin method @xcite .",
    "this method is semiclassical in character , with @xmath25 playing the same role as @xmath26 in the continuum phase integral method . to introduce this method ,",
    "let us write the schrdinger equation @xmath27 in the @xmath14 eigenbasis @xmath28 . with @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , we have _",
    "n = m-2^m+2 t_m , n c_n + w_m c_m = e c_m , [ seq ] where the prime on the sum indicates omission of the @xmath34 term .",
    "a vivid picture of the approximation can be obtained if we think of as the tight - binding model for an electron in a one - dimensional lattice with sites labelled by @xmath35 , and on - site ( @xmath36 ) and hopping ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) energies . if @xmath39 , these matrix elements vary slowly with @xmath35 , on a length scale of order @xmath40 in fact",
    ". we may then use the approximation of semiclassical dynamics by working entirely in terms of wavepackets whose spatial extent is much less than the length scale over which the properties of the lattice vary , i.e. , @xmath40 , and whose spread in bloch vectors is much less than the width of the brillouin zone , i.e. , @xmath41 .",
    "these ideas have close counterparts in the continuum quasiclassical method , and the dpi method is nothing but the discrete analog .",
    "when @xmath17 , the problem can also be approached using instantons  indeed the oscillations in the splitting were discovered in this way .",
    "when @xmath10 has other components besides @xmath15 , however , the dpi method is , to our knowledge , the only successful one to date .",
    "villain and fort s approach @xcite is also an approximate version of this method that makes artful use of some special features of the 8 problem and works for small values of the field .",
    "our analysis is more prosaic , and almost self - evident once one has understood how to deal with the new feature in the presence of second neighbour hopping .",
    "this gives rise to novel turning points with no continuum analogues .",
    "connection formulas for these turning points are given in .",
    "we have quoted the results of our analysis before @xcite(b ) , but the details are only being presented here .",
    "our main result for the specific hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is for the locations of the diabolical points .",
    "we find that the @xmath42th level in the negative @xmath14 well ( where @xmath43 denotes the lowest level ) and the @xmath44th level in the positive @xmath14 well are degenerate when ( see ) & = & (  -  ) 2 j [ plhz ] + h_x( ,  ) h_c & = & j , [ plhx ] with @xmath45 .",
    "here , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "it should be stressed that only represent the first terms of a series in @xmath25 , and that our dpi calculations give no reason to believe that the higher order terms are absent . yet",
    "a large amount of empirical evidence suggests just this , i.e. , that the _ formulas are exact as written _ ! that the diabolical points lie on a perfect centered rectangular lattice , and that many pairs of levels are simultaneously degenerate",
    ", we refer to as the perfect lattice hypothesis .",
    "it has previously been made for the ground state on the @xmath48 line by villain and fort , and extended to include simultaneous degeneracy of the higher states by us @xcite(b ) .",
    "this was shown by perturbation theory in @xmath49 to @xmath50 for all @xmath40 , and analytically for @xmath51 .",
    "we have since found analytically that for @xmath52 , the additional diabolical point at @xmath53 is exact .",
    "of course , kramers theorem guarantees double degeneracy of _ all _ energy eigenvalues at the point @xmath54 for all half - integral @xmath40 .",
    "we have also checked this hypothesis numerically for a variety of values of @xmath49 , and @xmath40 up to 10 .",
    "we present our results for @xmath55 in table i. the deviations in the locations of the diabolical points from the perfect lattice hypothesis predictions are never more than @xmath56 , certainly much less than order @xmath25 . in fact , the values listed are below the numerical tolerance that we prescribed .",
    "further support for the perfect lattice hypothesis comes from the fact that it is consistent with the following duality property of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "if we set @xmath57 , @xmath58 may be written as @xmath59 , showing its dependence on the three parameters , @xmath49 , @xmath15 and @xmath19 . by a @xmath60 rotation about the axis",
    "@xmath61 , we obtain the transformation ( , h_x , h_z ) -(1-,h_z , h_x ) .",
    "[ dual ] in particular , the spectra of the two hamiltonians are so related , and ranking the levels is order of increasing energy , we see that if the levels with ordinal numbers @xmath62 and @xmath63 are degenerate when @xmath64 and @xmath65 , then level numbers @xmath66 and @xmath67 are degenerate when @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "these conditions do not constrain the functions @xmath70 and @xmath71 in any real way , however , so the discovery of formulas ( [ plhz ] ) and ( [ plhx ] ) must presently be put down to serendipity .",
    "the plan of our paper is as follows . in",
    ", we analyze the asymmetric double well problem in completely general terms .",
    "we briefly review the dpi method and the asymmetric double - well problem in one dimensional quantum mechanics .",
    "in contrast to the situation that prevails in that case , we must deal with _ four _ independent dpi wavefunctions at every point .",
    "consequently the matching problem is harder and more subtle .",
    "its study forms the bulk ( subsections c to g ) of the analysis .",
    "the main result of this analysis is a formula for the diabolo [ ] , and a two level system hamiltonian [ ] .",
    "the tunneling amplitude appearing in these formulas is found in a general form [ ] involving a small number of action integrals running between various turning points .",
    "readers who are not interested in the details of the analysis should skip to subsection h and read on from .",
    "they may also find the last paragraph of interesting .    in",
    ", we apply the general analysis to the model ( [ ham ] ) for 8 . to keep the analysis tractable",
    ", we will assume that @xmath72 is small , although there is no reason why one could not apply the results of numerically for arbitrary values of @xmath19 .",
    "it may in fact be interesting to do this to further investigate the perfect lattice hypothesis .",
    "further , as discussed in , the duality property of @xmath58 immediately extends our work to large @xmath19 and small @xmath15 .",
    "very briefly , the dpi analysis proceeds as follows .",
    "( see and paper i for details . )",
    "let the energy of an electron wavepacket in the equivalent tight - binding model be given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath35 are the mean wavevector and position of the wavepacket , respectively .",
    "holding @xmath35 fixed , we may think of @xmath73 as a dispersion relation for the local energy band .",
    "the mean velocity of the wavepacket is then given by @xmath75 .",
    "if we regard @xmath35 as a continuous variable , and approximate @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath76 by smooth functions @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , then ( q , m ) & = & w(m ) + 2t_1(m ) q + 2t_2(m ) ( 2q ) , [ hsc ] + v(q , m ) & = & -2q(m ) ( t_1(m ) + 4 t_2(m ) q(m ) ) .",
    "[ vm ] in close analogy with the continuum method , one can show that the quasiclassical solution to the wavefunction for a given energy @xmath80 is given by linear combinations of solutions of the form c_m",
    "~1 i^m q(m ) dm , [ cwkb ] where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are given by e = ( q(m),m ) , v(m ) = v(q(m),m ) .",
    "[ eandv ]    it follows from that the quasiclassical solution breaks down when @xmath83which we call a turning point , as in the continuum case . at these points ,",
    "the solutions must be augmented by connection formulas .",
    "in addition to the values @xmath84 and @xmath85 , @xmath82 also vanishes at @xmath86 .",
    "we will get turning points whenever @xmath80 equals @xmath87 , @xmath88 , or @xmath89 , where these three functions are @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 respectively .",
    "these three curves , which we call _ critical curves _ , collectively play the same role as the potential energy in the continuum case .    for 8 , in the same reduced variables as in i [ @xmath93 , energies in units of @xmath94 , @xmath95 , the on - site and hopping energies are given by w(m ) & = & ( 1+)(1-^2 ) - 2 h_z , [ wm ] + t_1(m ) & = & - h_x ( 1-^2)^1/2 , [ t1 m ] + t_2(m ) & = & ( 1- ) ( 1-^2 ) .",

    "the lower band edge is given by @xmath87 for values of @xmath35 close to @xmath99 , and by @xmath89 for @xmath35 in the central region .",
    "in the central region , the second neighbour hopping element @xmath79 is sufficiently large that the local energy band @xmath73 has its global minimum not at @xmath84 , but at @xmath100 . since the energy @xmath101 lies in the band , @xmath102 .",
    "by contrast , in the outer @xmath35 regions , @xmath73 has only one minimum ( at @xmath84 ) and only one maximum ( at @xmath85 ) for real @xmath74 .",
    "the energy @xmath103 lies outside the band , so that once again @xmath102 . the curves @xmath87 and @xmath89 touch one another with a common tangent at @xmath104 , where m^ * = ^1/2 .",

    "the wavevector @xmath100 at the turning point is then complex , and the wavefunction @xmath106 changes from a decaying ( or growing ) exponential on one side to a decaying ( or growing ) exponential with an oscillatory envelope on the other side .",
    "these turning points are the new feature caused by second neightbor hopping that we referred to in .",
    "to understand how the dpi solutions are to be used to find the eigenstates , it is useful to discuss the corresponding problem for an asymmetric double well in the continuum case .",
    "suppose the potential is as drawn in .",
    "the potential minima are at @xmath107 , and for the energy @xmath80 drawn , the turning points are at @xmath108 and @xmath109 in the left well , and @xmath110 and @xmath111 in the right well .",
    "we use the quasiclassical approximation to find a wavefunction @xmath112 on the left hand side as follows .",

    "this solution is matched via connection formulas at @xmath108 to an oscillatory solution in the region @xmath114 .",

    "we repeat this procedure on the right hand side to find a wavefunction @xmath116 that decays to zero as @xmath117 .",
    "the last step is to demand that the wavefunctions @xmath112 and @xmath116 be the same in the central region , i.e. , in the vicinity of @xmath118 .",
    "this demand will be unsatisfiable for an arbitrarily chosen energy @xmath80 , and will provide one with the eignevalue condition .",
    "there are two remarks that we wish make about the above procedure .",
    "the first remark concerns the basic nature of the solution . in general , in the central region , the left solution @xmath112 will be a linear combination of two parts , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , that are exponentially decaying and growing as @xmath121 increases , respectively .",
    "likewise the right solution , @xmath122 , will be a sum of parts that decay ( @xmath123 ) and grow ( @xmath124 ) as @xmath125 increases .",
    "the key point is that the growing parts @xmath126 and @xmath124 must be present in an eigenstate , for without them , there is no way that the values and slopes of @xmath127 and @xmath122 could be made to agree at @xmath118 , say .",
    "the second remark is technical .",
    "if the potential well is reasonably parabolic near the minimum at @xmath128 , the schrdinger equation can be solved directly for any choice of @xmath80 in terms of parabolic cylinder functions , and we can always find a linear combination that will decay to zero as @xmath129 .",
    "this linear combination will have both growing and decaying pieces as @xmath130 grows . in this way",
    "we can obtain the wavefucnction @xmath112 on the entire left hand side without using connection formulas at @xmath108 or @xmath109 .",
    "once one has found @xmath112 sufficiently far to the right of @xmath109 in this way , one can write the parabolic cylinder functions in quasiclassical form which can then be extended in this form all the way to @xmath118 .",
    "the right - hand wavefunction can be treated in the same way .",
    "this device leads to considerable savings in labor .",
    "we now apply these ideas to our problem . in",
    "what follows , we will denote quantities pertaining to the left hand solution or the left hand side of the well by either a single prime or a suffix @xmath131 , while analogous right - hand quantities will carry a double prime or a @xmath132 suffix .",
    "we consider an energy @xmath80 as drawn in , which leads to turning points at @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 on the left hand side , and @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 on the right .",
    "the wavefunction @xmath139 will decay away from the well bottom as @xmath140 decreases , oscillate in the classically allowed region @xmath141 @xcite . in the region just to the right of @xmath134 it will consist of a decaying part and a growing part .",
    "the new feature will be encountered at @xmath135 where @xmath105 . for @xmath142 ,",
    "both the growing and decaying parts will acquire oscillatory envelopes .",
    "similar remarks apply to the right side wavefunction @xmath143 .",
    "we are now ready to find the wavefunction explicitly .",
