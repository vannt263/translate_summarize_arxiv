    "one of the necessary ingredients in an effective field theory ( eft ) is the ultraviolet regularization .",
    "a natural regularization for the eft is one that removes from loop integrals all contributions with momenta above the eft energy scale , @xmath0 , and that also implements a low - energy counting by making the small energy scales in the eft , namely small momenta and light particle masses , the scales that set the magnitude of power ultraviolet divergences .",
    "one example of such a natural regularization is dimensional regularization in eft with only light particles , such as chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite for quasi - goldstone pions . in dimensional",
    "regularization the scale of chpt is given in terms of the pion decay constant @xmath1 , and power divergences of loop integrals are proportional to the small scales ( @xmath2 and/or invariants formed with the small external momenta ) divided by the appropriate powers of @xmath1 .",
    "although a momentum cutoff can be used , it does not deal well with power divergences , as these contain pieces proportional to powers of the cutoff . in this case",
    ", an eft can also be formulated , but it is more complicated to deal with because the low - energy power counting must be recovered in the process of renormalization .    in an eft with a heavy stable particle , such as chpt with nucleons ,",
    "the heavy particle mass @xmath3 is a new scale in the theory ( some heavy masses could be much larger than @xmath0 , e.g. , baryon masses in large-@xmath4 qcd ) . with the inclusion of @xmath3 , dimensional",
    "regularization ceases to be a natural regularization .",
    "indeed , the power divergences lead now to contributions proportional to fractional powers of @xmath3 , i.e.   contributions that give rise to terms that are powers of @xmath5 times @xmath6 in @xmath7 dimensions .",
    "one such example is the nucleon self - energy in chpt calculated in dimensional regularization @xcite .",
    "although the eft can be consistently regularized with dimensional regularization , a natural regularization is more convenient .    in the case ,",
    "where a single heavy particle propagates through a feynman diagram , one way to remove fractional powers of @xmath3 @xcite is to perform an expansion in @xmath8 at the level of the lagrangian @xcite , eliminating in this way @xmath3 from the propagators .",
    "this approach implies that all the green functions must be analytic functions of @xmath8 in the low - energy region .",
    "this , however , is not correct because there are low - energy singularities in @xmath8 , such as the anomalous thresholds ( e.g. , in the scalar form factor of the nucleon @xcite ) , which the eft must retain .",
    "recently , a regularization based on dimensional regularization that avoids these problems of the @xmath8 expansion was developed .",
    "building on work by ellis and tang @xcite , becher and leutwyler @xcite developed a regularization scheme that is natural , preserves the low - energy structure and internal symmetries , and is lorentz covariant .",
    "this regularization has been called infrared regularization .    in the case of two heavy particles",
    ", the @xmath8 expansion can not be applied due to the two - heavy particle threshold in the s - channel .",
    "it is , therefore , very important to develop a natural regularization for this case as well . in this letter",
    "such a regularization is developed along lines similar to those of the infrared regularization @xcite .",
    "starting from standard dimensional regularization , a modification of the feynman parameter integration domain is introduced leading to a natural regularization .",
    "its implementation is presented in a lorentz covariant framework for basic one - loop diagrams .",
    "in this section , the basic one - loop diagrams in the two - heavy - particle sector are discussed : these are the bubble diagram fig .  [",

    "in addition , @xmath11 is an analytic function in the low - energy domain ( i.e. local ) and is referred to as the regular part .",
    "the low - energy part @xmath12 contains all the low - energy analytic structure of the integral .",

    "the reason why @xmath84 has an ultraviolet divergence despite @xmath85 being ultraviolet finite is that in order to contain the fractional powers of @xmath3 while being regular in the low - energy domain , it must include the appropriate logarithmic dependence on @xmath86 , and this can only emerge if there is a @xmath87 singularity .",

    "the integral @xmath88 is given by : @xmath89 with @xmath90    and the integral @xmath91 is on the other hand given by : @xmath92 with @xmath93 it is to be noted that the integral @xmath88 has no ultraviolet divergences .",
    "such divergences can only come from the boundary contributions in the integration by parts over @xmath58 , which in this case have to vanish because the domain of integration extends to the entire real axis .",
    "the low energy parts do not contain any fractional powers of @xmath3 , as their explicit evaluation reveals the absence of @xmath94 terms .",
    "thus , as in the case of the bubble diagram , the separation into low - energy and regular parts is also possible in the triangle diagram .",

    "the procedure for separating @xmath101 into its regular and low - energy parts , @xmath102 , is therefore identical to the prescription given for the triangle diagram in the previous sub - section .",
    "it has been shown that each basic one - loop integral @xmath9 in the two - heavy - particle sector can be decomposed into a low - energy part @xmath12 whose low - energy analytic structure coincides with that of @xmath9 , and a regular part which consists of the terms in @xmath9 that have factors of fractional powers of the large mass @xmath3 .",
    "the eftdr is now implemented by discarding @xmath11 , which amounts to removing specific local terms in the low - energy domain . the eftdr so defined is a natural regularization .",
    "the local terms in @xmath12 can be ordered according to a power counting scheme in the low - energy scales generically denoted by @xmath17 . for a given one - loop diagram",

    "this power counting is the standard one obtained in the @xmath8 expansion @xcite .",
    "the different non - analytic terms can be classified according to their infrared behavior .",
    "in particular , some of them are more singular than the local terms .",
    "for example , the low - energy power counting for the bubble diagram would be @xmath108 , but eq .   shows that it is more singular than this .",
    "if one takes @xmath109 to be of order @xmath110 , the bubble diagram is of order @xmath17 . in the case of the triangle , @xmath111 , while @xmath60 is more singular by one unit .",
    "as it is well known , these more singular behaviors are associated with the existence of the two - heavy - particle threshold .",
    "as first noticed in reference @xcite , the fact that the low - energy and regular parts have different behaviors in @xmath3 ( the regular part being entirely of fractional power of m and the low - energy part having no such terms ) , implies that the symmetries respected by dimensional regularization are also respected by each part separately and , therefore , by eftdr .",
    "finally , the generalization to diagrams that involve insertions of small external momenta can be carried out quite easily .",
    "first , the propagators along each heavy particle line are separately combined using two sets of feynman parameters , and a parameter @xmath58 is then used to combine the two results .",
    "next , and after combining the light particle propagators , a second parameter @xmath112 is used to combine this result with that of the heavy propagators .",
    "the integration over the loop momentum is then performed , and subsequently the integration domain in @xmath63 is extended as in the case of the triangle diagram , leaving the integration domains of the remaining feynman parameters unchanged . a more extensive presentation of this and other points in this letter will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
