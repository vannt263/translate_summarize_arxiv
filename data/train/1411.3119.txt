    "it is generally accepted now that as - rich @xmath8 surface is divided into two phases : the @xmath6 phase ( terminated by ga - as dimers ) which depending on the as pressure exists up to 400- 550 k and the @xmath9 phase ( terminated by as - as dimers ) between 400k and 770k @xcite .",

    "the independent path ( 49 ) is not the fastest one , but it is interesting because it bypasses site 7 , the one of the lowest energy , what means that once particle comes out of the lowest energy site it can slide over states with higher energy .",
    "such independent path and avoiding site  7 is the most important one in direction y. it appears that due to the symmetry of the lattice all possible paths along direction y bypass the lowest site as can be seen in fig .",

    "it appears that @xmath1 structure is far more asymmetric that @xmath2 structure . and",
    "also when we compare values of coefficients it comes out that diffusion over the surface with lower symmetry , @xmath154 is of one order of magnitude lower that that for the surface of @xmath155 symmetry .",
    "it appears that changes of surface structure towards system of lower symmetry can be noted in the decrease of the diffusion process .",
    "faster , more effective diffusion process at given temperature is characteristic for the surface @xmath2 , the reconstruction of higher symmetry .",
