    "in the age of large scale surveys , astronomy has evolved from small number statistics to samplings of large volumes yielding increasingly large datasets .",
    "in addition to the characteristics of the stellar population and nuclear activity gleaned from surveys like the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) , the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass , @xcite ) , and the galaxy evolution explorer all sky survey ( galex ais , @xcite ) , a key ingredient to understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies is their neutral gas content , a tracer of star formation potential and past mergers . among the first generation hi surveys",
    "were the arecibo hi strip survey ( ahiss , @xcite ) , the arecibo dual beam survey ( adbs , @xcite ) , and the hi parkes all - sky survey ( hipass , @xcite ) .",
    "ahiss made 66 hi detections in 65 deg@xmath2 , and adbs yielded 265 extragalactic detections in @xmath6430 deg@xmath2 of northern sky .",
    "hipass found 4315 and 1002 objects in the southern and northern catalogs respectively which together covered 71@xmath7 of the sky . by combining the superior sensitivity of the arecibo telescope and its new multi - beam l - band feed array ( alfa ) , the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey ( alfalfa ; @xcite ) improves on previous efforts both in its higher angular resolution , in sensitivity and in spectral bandwidth and resolution .",
    "the alfalfa survey aims to obtain a thorough census of neutral hydrogen in the local universe and will eventually cover 7000 deg@xmath8 of sky over a redshift range of @xmath92000 to 18,000 km s@xmath10 .    the large areal coverage of the alfalfa survey and its ability to detect objects of extremely narrow hi line width will permit the determination of the low - mass slope of the hi mass function ( himf ) and its relationship to galaxy environment .",
    "alfalfa is already dramatically increasing the number of known dwarfs in the local universe , including @xmath6300 objects with hi masses below @xmath11 found so far in the catalog extracted from only 20% of the planned survey .",
    "born out of small mass - density fluctuations , these dwarfs would originally exist as low - mass dark matter halos under the @xmath5cdm framework , and , according to hierarchical clustering models , may be analogs of the building blocks of more massive galaxies seen at the current epoch .",
    "however , despite strong agreement between simulations of structure formation and large - scale observations like the cosmic microwave background @xcite and galaxy clustering ( e.g. @xcite ) , the number and distribution of observed dwarf satellites do not match those predicted for the low - mass halos @xcite .",
    "studies of the luminosity function of galaxies in a range of galaxy environments @xcite have consistently found shallower faint end slopes @xmath12 than the value of @xmath13 predicted by @xmath5cdm @xcite . similar examinations of the low - mass end of the himf will determine whether or not these objects instead exist as a population of low - mass , gaseous haloes that either lack stars entirely or are very low surface brightness .",
    "we present in this paper the first himf dominated by low - mass objects and derived from the alfalfa dataset : the himf for the leo i group of galaxies .    to probe adequately the low mass slope of the himf , the alfalfa blind hi survey targets the inner regions of the local supercluster for the lowest mass galaxies detectable outside of the local group .",
    "in addition to the area in and around the virgo cluster @xcite , early coverage of the alfalfa survey crosses the leo region , a complex collection of structures crowded in velocity space and in a small area of sky . in the foreground",
    "is leo i , the nearest group to contain giant ellipticals , lenticulars , and spirals @xcite . at the leo i distance of roughly 11 mpc",
    ", alfalfa can detect objects down to a mass of @xmath14 m@xmath15 for an hi line width of 25 km s@xmath10at a signal - to - noise level of 6 .",
    "relative to other nearby groups , leo i is poor in terms of overall luminosity and number of l@xmath16 galaxies @xcite and is characterized by a low crossing time and velocity dispersion ( @xmath17 km s@xmath10 ; see section [ veldispsec ] ) .",
    "however , the total luminosity of leo i is still higher than that of the local group @xcite where the local density enhancement is not thought to be large enough to support large and luminous early - type galaxies like the e / s0 galaxies found in leo i. intermediate density locations like leo i where the intragroup medium is typically not dense enough for ram pressure stripping to be significant , but where interactions with other group members clearly occur , are key to understanding the effects of environment on galaxy evolution .",
    "evidence of interactions among leo i group members is most obvious in the previously identified extended hi features known as the leo ring and in the region of the leo triplet .",
    "an intergalactic ring of neutral hydrogen roughly 225 kpc in diameter surrounds m105 and ngc  3384 and contains @xmath18 of hi gas @xcite .",
    "a spur connects the gas cloud with the warped disk of the m96 spiral galaxy , suggesting the gas may have been swept out after an interaction involving ngc  3384 and m96 @xcite .",
    "however , the central bars and dust rings of the three brightest nearby galaxies ( ngc  3384 , m96 & m105 ) which all have similar spatial orientations to the ring @xcite and the ring s keplerian rotation @xcite together suggest the gas could instead be primordial and left over from the formation of the galaxy group .    another tidal encounter in leo i is thought to have occurred between the large spirals ngc  3628 and m66 ( ngc  3627 ) to create one of the largest known tidal tails extending @xmath6100 kpc off of ngc  3628 @xcite . in m66 , an asymmetric hi disk and",
    "a recent ( less than 1 gyr ago ) burst of star formation coinciding with the time of the suspected encounter both suggest that an interaction between ngc  3628 and m66 led to ngc  3628 s extensive gas loss @xcite . despite being morphologically similar to m66",
    ", the third member of the triplet , ngc  3623 , has had a quiescent star formation history in the more recent past and appears to have escaped any direct collisions @xcite .",

    "the contribution of the leo group to large scale structure is evident in the spike between cz @xmath51 km s@xmath10  and cz @xmath52 km s@xmath10  in figure [ histplot]a . also contributing to the structure is the noticeable paucity of sources at a redshift of @xmath6 2200 km s@xmath10  just behind leo ii .",

    "other rfi contributions are negligible when averaged over the whole dataset .    the significant contribution of the alfalfa survey to the number of known dwarf galaxies in the nearby universe is revealed in the remaining histograms . because they are of low mass , dwarf galaxies are expected to have small w50 .",
    "most previous hi surveys have been limited by their poorer spectral resolution to detection of significantly larger line widths .",
    "for example , no objects with w50 @xmath48 30 km s@xmath10  were found in all of southern hipass ( @xmath621,000 deg@xmath8 ; @xcite ) while , as shown in figure [ histplot]b , 55 low width sources are included in the current alfalfa catalog in the leo region alone ( 354 deg@xmath2 ) .",
    "roughly half of these low - w50 hi detections have no associated optical galaxy and are thought to be emission from either the leo ring or the extended hi in the leo triplet region ( see section [ nooc ] ) . of the remaining 30 sources , only ten have signal - to - noise ratios of greater than 10 suggesting that , while alfalfa clearly has the ability to detect objects of very narrow line widths , dwarf galaxies with w50@xmath48 30 km s@xmath10  are most likely rarer than dwarfs of higher w50 .",
    "new detections of nearby dwarfs are also expected to push the lower limits of hi flux and mass . as shown in figure",
    "[ histplot]c , nearly half of the objects from the current alfalfa catalog of the leo region have integrated fluxes of less than 1.0 jy km s@xmath10 , the completeness limit for broad signals in alfalfa .",
    "( the limit is even lower for narrow signals at @xmath540.25 jy km s@xmath10 . ) in more than 60 times the areal sky coverage , the southern hipass catalog contains only one source below 1.0 jy km s@xmath10  @xcite .",

    "the percentage of low - mass objects in the leo region is comparable to the 8@xmath7 found in the much denser virgo region @xcite .",
    "although virgo at 16 mpc is larger and more densely populated , leo is slightly closer to the local group at @xmath611 mpc away and thus allows for the detection of even lower mass objects down to @xmath57 .",
    "figure [ dotplot ] shows the relation of hi mass to distance and of s / n and integrated flux to velocity width for the sample .",
    "the stacking of objects at 11 and 17 mpc in figure [ dotplot]a comes from placing nearby objects at a variety of recessional velocities at the distances adopted for leo i and ii ( see section [ grouping ] for an explanation of how the distances and group members were chosen ) .",
    "the lack of sources seen in figure [ histplot]a around 2200 km s@xmath10  ( which roughly translates to 30 mpc ) is still present .",
    "this paucity is also seen in the distribution of the @xmath63800 optical redshifts found in the agc within the same right ascension , declination , and velocity bounds , suggesting the gap accurately reflects the large scale structure in the region .",
    "rfi from the san juan faa radar transmitter causes the gap in detections near 230 mpc shown both by the vertical lines in the upper panel of figure [ dotplot ] and by the dip at 16,000 km s@xmath10 in the redshift histogram of figure [ histplot]a .",
    "the middle and lower panels of figure [ dotplot ] show that while the distribution of s / n appears to be unbiased toward larger velocity widths ( i.e. the lower envelope is constant over the entire width range ) , the integrated flux values do depend on width .",
    "the dashed line in the lower panel indicates a constant s / n level of 6.5 .",
    "this expected trend @xcite was also noted in previous alfalfa catalog releases @xcite .",
    "only seven objects have w50 @xmath58 600 km s@xmath10 , and only one of the seven ( ugc 6066 ) has a @xmath59 ( ugc 6066 , an edge - on galaxy with @xmath60 km s@xmath10  & w50 @xmath61 km s@xmath10 ) .",
    "the low number of high - w50 detections in this dataset is partially a reflection of the small area of sky being considered ; nineteen additional high - w50 sources are found in the currently available alfalfa spring - sky catalog , six of which have @xmath59 . despite more high - w50 sources found in the alfalfa - leo catalog than in the southern hipass one ( only 8 objects with w50 @xmath58 600 km s@xmath10 ; @xcite )",
    ", the number of galaxies falls off quickly for large widths , w50 @xmath58 600 km s@xmath10  for both samples .",
    "although an intrinsic rarity of sources of high velocity width and low flux most likely plays a role in this paucity , such objects are also difficult to detect both by eye and with matched - filtering algorithms for fixed rms , resulting in a known survey bias against large widths .",

    "more than 100 detections listed in the alfalfa catalogs for the leo region do not have clearly associated optical counterparts .",

    "the analysis presented here avoids several problems plaguing determinations of hi mass functions for global samples and even for surveys of larger clusters because leo i is restricted to a small , nearby volume . in wide area surveys like the @xcite sample of 265 adbs galaxies , the @xcite sample of 2771 optically - selected galaxies , or the @xcite sample of 4315 southern hipass galaxies , the large search volume results in detection of objects in the foreground of the sample that could not have been detected at larger distances .",
    "each source must then be weighted by @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the maximum volume within which it could have been detected . even in the blind hi surveys focused on the ursa major cluster @xcite and on the canes venatici group @xcite , the front and back of the cluster",
    "are separated enough to require a @xmath103 correction .",
    "all of the leo i sources , however , are at roughly the same distance , and the minor volume difference between the foreground of the leo i cloud and the background where leo i meets leo ii is not large enough to significantly affect the completeness of our sample in terms of volume .",
    "the proximity of leo i also results in a galaxy sample that is complete down to a lower flux limit throughout the entire survey volume than is possible for wide area surveys probing more distant galaxy populations . at the leo",
    "i distance , the lowest flux reached is 0.20 jy km s@xmath10  which translates to an hi mass of @xmath105 .",
    "thus only the lowest mass bin of the leo i himf representing objects with masses between @xmath106 and @xmath107 needs to be corrected for being populated only down to @xmath108 .",
    "as was done for the determinations of the himf based on other blind hi surveys @xcite , a correction is needed to account for the dependence of the integrated flux detection limit on the hi line velocity width for alfalfa detections . as shown in figure [ dotplot]c ,",
    "an hi spectroscopic survey such as alfalfa naturally yields a lack of sources with both low fluxes and large velocity widths . to address this bias without over - correcting for an intrinsically small population , we examine the distributions of velocity width for varying hi mass as determined by a complete sample consisting of all of the currently alfalfa spring sky catalog detections available to us with integrated fluxes greater than 1.0 jy km s@xmath10 .",
    "it should be noted that although the flux completeness limit dips below 1.0 jy km s@xmath10  to @xmath6.25 jy km s@xmath10  for sources of lower velocity widths , these are not the sources in need of the correction we are seeking here . since the sample is complete , these distributions reflect the intrinsic nature of the alfalfa sources without a velocity width - integrated flux selection bias . by comparing these",

    "three separate sources of error contribute to the uncertainties in the determination of the himf based on the two completeness corrections discussed above and on poisson statistics .",
    "the error associated with the correction for the flux - width dependence is estimated from the errors associated with each fit to the ` expected ' distributions of hi mass versus velocity width .",
    "this source of error does not apply for sources of @xmath109 since the correction is unneccessary for high masses .",
    "the second completeness correction only applies to the lowest mass bin and thus so does the additional associated error .",
    "the final contribution of poisson errors affects all hi mass bins and equals @xmath110 where n is the number of galaxies in the bin .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the use of hubble flow distances leads to large errors in @xmath67 and the himf most significantly for nearby galaxies where peculiar velocites are a more significant fraction of measured recessional velocities . both @xcite and @xcite use flow model distances in their himf determinations but claim comparisons with hubble flow distances show no difference .",
    "@xcite point out that since peculiar motions only affect a small fraction of their sample , they would not expect a different result between the two methods .",
    "however , the population of galaxies most important in determination of the low mass slope are the same galaxies whose distances uncertainties are most impacted by peculiar velocities : the lowest mass objects that make up only a very small fraction of both the hipass and adbs samples . despite being dominated by these low mass , nearby galaxies , the leo i sample is able to reduce significantly the errors based on distance measurements by using group distances determined with the help of 10 primary distances .",
    "the leo i hi mass function is shown in figure [ himfplot ] .",
    "there are no objects with hi masses greater than @xmath111 in the leo i volume ; we represent this lack of sources with a downward arrow .",
    "the current alfalfa catalog subtends a volume of @xmath112 mpc@xmath113 and contains 6249 high quality ( code 1 ) detections .",
    "1178 of those have masses of @xmath114 and 26 have masses of @xmath115 .",
    "when compared to the leo i volume of @xmath619 mpc@xmath113 , the fraction of high mass objects in the larger alfalfa sample translates to an expected @xmath60.01 objects of @xmath114 and an expected @xmath60.0002 objects of @xmath115 within the volume of leo i. thus the lack of objects contributing to the himf at the high - mass end do not reflect the lack of such a population but rather the limited volume of our leo i catalog .",
    "for a hubble constant of @xmath116 km s@xmath10  mpc@xmath10 , a linear fit to the leo i himf gives a slope of @xmath90.41 and a y - offset of 3.33 .",
    "this slope is identical to that of the best fit schechter function which has parameters @xmath117 mpc@xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 .",
    "the linear fit is overplotted in figure [ himfplot ] .",
    "our determination of the leo i himf assumes a volume for the leo i group of 18.7 mpc@xmath113 with an estimated error of @xmath69 4 mpc@xmath113 .",
    "however this error only affects @xmath121 for the himf and does not contribute to errors in @xmath12 .",
    "however , the inclusion versus exclusion of leo i objects that were not clearly in the m96 or m66 groups ( as described in section [ groupmemi ] ) does affect the low mass end slope .",
    "if these objects are placed at the m66 group distance of 10.0 mpc or the m96 group distance of 11.1 mpc instead of using flow model distances , @xmath12 is increased by 0.2 or 0.15 respectively .",
    "thus we estimate that for the leo i himf , @xmath122 .",

    "these estimates are all significantly lower than the prediction of 165 low - mass objects from the leo i himf . without even correcting for completeness , there are more low - mass objects in the leo i sample than are predicted for all of the global samples .",
    "the leo i sample thus suggests a population of low hi mass objects in the intermediate density group that was not found by earlier , global determinations of the himf .",
    "since the global himfs represent an averaging over a range of galaxy environments and thus are not expected to match the number of low - mass objects found in the overdense leo i group , a fairer comparison can be made with the himf determined for the canes venatici group @xcite . a quantitative comparison is not made with the ursa major himf since precise fit parameters are not quoted in that study . after correcting for completeness , @xcite expects 61 hi detections below a mass of @xmath128 with a low mass slope of @xmath129 .",

    "( cvn has a group distance of @xmath64.1 mpc as determined by primary distances to 17 group members from @xcite . )",

    "the cvn group thus may represent an environment where interactions do not play a significant role in galaxy evolution , in contrast to the leo i environment where strong evidence exists for previous galaxy encounters .    despite having the highest percentage of low mass objects ,",
    "the leo i himf does not have the steepest low - mass slope .",
    "however , the two determinations of the himf that have higher slopes ( @xcite and @xcite ) use six and seven galaxies respectively to determine those slopes",
    ". these samples also have the lowest number of total galaxies with the exception of those focused on specific galaxy groups .",
    "these higher slopes are thus more likely to be poorly constrained due to limitations of sample size rather than representative of a significantly larger population of low - mass objects missed by alfalfa .",
    "the slope derived for the himf of @xcite also most likely suffers from the largest distance errors of the seven samples presented in table [ alphatable ] as their distances are based on hubble flow after correcting measured velocities to the local group frame and do not take into account peculiar velocities .      using a deep optical survey covering a small portion of leo i aimed at studying the faint - end of the optical luminosity function ( lf ) , ( @xcite ; hereafter tt02 ) determined the leo i lf to have a flat faint end slope and estimated a dwarf - to - giant ratio of 1.6 @xmath69 0.9 , the lowest of the six groups in that study .",
    "the tt02 dwarf designation is based on optical properties ( @xmath130 ) and thus a direct comparison can not be made to the number of dwarfs presented in the alfalfa survey s coverage of leo i. however , as a first order approximation , after labelling all objects with @xmath131 and @xmath132 km s@xmath10  as `` dwarfs '' , the alfalfa sample , once corrected for completeness , gives a ratio of 9.9 dwarfs for every giant galaxy .",
    "the dwarf - to - giant ratio found by alfalfa does not include lenticular or elliptical galaxies , both of which are found in leo i and would contribute to the lower ratio found by the tt02 survey .",
    "however , given that leo i has few l@xmath16 galaxies compared to other nearby groups , these e / s0s may not make up the whole difference in the optically versus hi - selected ratios .",
    "the discrepancy may also be indicative of the existence of a population of gas - rich yet optically faint dwarfs that were either discarded as background galaxies or of too low optical surface brightness to be detected by the optical tt02 survey .",
    "tt02 report the ratio of dwarf ellipticals ( des ) to dwarf irregulars ( dis ) in leo i to be 40% , a much lower fraction than the @xmath680% found for all other groups in their study but one , the very poor ngc 1023 group .",
    "a comparatively low percentage of des would further enhance the contribution made to the leo i dwarf sample by a population of optically - faint dis .",
    "another factor contributing to the larger number of dwarfs in the hi - selected alfalfa sample may be that the small portion of the leo i group covered by the tt02 survey ( 0.0663 mpc@xmath2 compared to the 12.8 mpc@xmath2 surveyed by alfalfa ) did not accurately represent the group as a whole .",
    "although tt02 probe their search area to fainter magnitudes than previous studies , with their limited strip of coverage tt02 are not even able to include m96 as a group member because the galaxy is far outside their survey bounds .",
    "shallower surveys with larger sky coverage of the region have observed 9 deg@xmath2 centered on the core of the m96 group ( @xmath60.3 mpc@xmath2 at a distance of 11.1 mpc ) and found faint end slopes steeper than that for tt02 , but still not as steep as for the leo i himf .",
    "@xcite found @xmath133 and @xcite determined @xmath134 .",
    "these samples may not have the sensitivity needed to detect the gas - rich , low surface brightness galaxies more easily found by a blind hi survey of sufficient sensitivity .",
    "alternatively , by focusing only on the center of the m96 group , these optical surveys may be sampling a different dwarf population than that found by the much wider area alfalfa strategy .",
    "large numbers of gas - rich dis found further away from the more massive group members would suggest evidence for morphological segregation in leo i as is seen in the local group @xcite .",
    "a complete analysis of the optical properties of the alfalfa catalog leo sample will be presented in a future paper to enable direct comparisons with the magnitude limits of these optically - selected samples .",
    "we presented the results from the alfalfa survey s current coverage of the leo region ( @xmath26 and @xmath19 ) which contribute new spectroscopic detections for 48 previously unconfirmed dwarf galaxies with @xmath135 .",
    "nearby hi - bearing dwarfs are most commonly characterized by low hi flux and narrow hi line width . in the @xmath621,000 deg@xmath2 of sky covered by hipass ,",
    "the most extensive previous blind hi survey , hipass found 44 objects with @xmath131 , detected 1 object with an hi flux less than 1 jy km s@xmath10 , and made no detections with hi line widths narrower than 30 km s@xmath10 .",
    "in the 354 deg@xmath2 surrounding the leo groups ( @xmath136 of the total coverage of hipass ) , alfalfa finds 118 objects with @xmath131 , detects 260 objects with hi fluxes less than 1 jy km s@xmath10 , and makes 55 detections with hi line widths narrower than 30 km s@xmath10 . after membership determinations are made for the leo i group , alfalfa finds 45 low - mass group members , which is more than were detected for the entire southern hipass sample .",
    "the hi mass function was determined for the leo i group , an environment dominated by dwarfs with 69% of the galaxies in the sample having @xmath131 .",
    "the best fit schechter function and linear fits both give the leo i himf a low mass slope of @xmath122 . with scaling to account for the higher density environment represented by leo i , this slope is steeper than that for the optically - selected sample of @xcite , the hipass survey @xcite , and the survey of the canes venatici group done by @xcite , but still consistent within the quoted error .",
    "two himfs have produced steeper slopes than that for leo i , the zone of avoidance survey @xcite and the adbs , hi - selected survey @xcite , but these surveys have only six and seven total low - mass ( @xmath131 ) detections respectively and most likely carry large distance errors ; the low mass slope of the leo i himf was more robustly determined .",
    "the leo i himf has a steeper low mass end slope than was found for three luminosity functions based on samples of varying depths and sky coverage . in the deepest of these optical surveys designed to find low luminosity dwarfs in leo i but most limited in sky coverage",
    ", @xcite found 1.6 dwarfs for every giant in the group . using a rough estimate based on hi mass and line width",
    ", alfalfa found a dwarf - to - giant ratio of 9.9 , more than six times higher than in the optically - selected sample .",
    "this discrepancy may suggest the existence of a population of gas - rich yet optically faint dwarfs not included in the optically - selected sample but is also affected by the lack of e / s0 galaxies in the hi - selected alfalfa sample . in a direct comparison between an optical survey of the m96 group @xcite and a portion of the alfalfa survey with the same sky coverage , every group member not found in the optical survey was a dwarf , while only half of the members missed by alfalfa were dwarfs , and the rest were l@xmath16 galaxies ( i.e. ellipticals or lenticulars with @xmath137 ) .",
    "the alfalfa detection statistics in the leo region reflect the results of the larger survey . in only 20% of the survey s full intended coverage",
    ", alfalfa has already detected @xmath6300 objects with @xmath131 , many of which were previously uncatalogued .",
    "the large number of hi - rich dwarfs suggests there may be a significant population of low surface brightness , low - mass galaxies that are missed by optical surveys whether it be due to sensitivity or survey coverage and by hi surveys of lower sensitivity .",
    "however , even though the leo i himf is the first himf to be dominated by low - mass galaxies , the low - mass slope still falls short of the @xmath138 predicted by cold dark matter simulations .",
    "the next step to understanding this newly uncovered dwarf population is to examine the optical properties of the alfalfa dwarf sample .",
    "a detailed analysis of the optical properties of leo i group dwarfs will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "a comparison of their surface brightnesses and morphologies with those of the dwarfs uncovered in optical surveys of leo i will show whether alfalfa dwarfs were of too low surface brightness to be detected in optical searches or if they resemble background galaxies and thus were systematically excluded from studies of the group . if mass - to - light ratios for these dwarfs are found to be higher than average , these low mass galaxies may represent a dwarf population missed by earlier surveys .",
    "answers to these questions can help determine whether the alfalfa dwarf population reveals an observational limitation signifcant enough to account for the so - called ` missing satellites ' , or if hi - rich dwarfs alone are not enough .",

    "<S> the hi catalog presented here for this 118-deg@xmath2 region is combined with ones derived from surrounding regions also covered by the alfalfa survey to examine the large scale structure in the complex leo region . because of the combination of wide sky coverage and superior sensitivity , spatial and spectral resolution , the alfalfa hi catalog of the leo region improves significantly on the numbers of low hi mass sources as compared with those found in previous hi surveys . </S>",
    "<S> the hi mass function of the leo i group presented here is dominated by low - mass objects : 45 of the 65 leo i members have @xmath3 , yielding tight constraints on the low - mass slope of the leo i hi mass function . </S>",
    "<S> the best - fit slope is @xmath4 . a direct comparison between the alfalfa hi line detections and an optical search of the leo i region proves the advantage of the alfalfa strategy in finding low mass , gas - rich dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest the existence of a significant population of low surface brightness , gas - rich , yet still very low hi mass galaxies , and may reflect the same type of morphological segregation as is seen in the local group . while the low mass end slope of the leo i hi mass </S>",
    "<S> function is steeper than that determined for luminosity functions of the group , the slope still falls short of the values predicted by simulations of structure formation in the @xmath5cdm paradigm . </S>"
