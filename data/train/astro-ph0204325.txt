    "the recent literature contains claims for time variation in the fine structure constant @xmath0 at a level of one part in @xmath3 since a redshift of 2 , based on observations of metal ions backlit by distant quasars @xcite .",
    "regardless of theoretical prejuduce for or against these claims @xcite , it is of interest to examine other constraints on @xmath0 variation . in particular",
    ", changing the fine structure constant would influence the abundances of light nuclides produced during big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "bbn took place at redshifts @xmath4 , ending minutes after the big bang , and it is the earliest cosmological test for which the basic physical laws are well - understood .",
    "the physics is less certain in varying-@xmath0 scenarios , but bbn remains the earliest reasonable probe of variations in @xmath0 .",
    "it thus provides a large lever arm in the sense that if @xmath0 varies with time , larger variations may plausibly ( though not necessarily @xcite ) be observed over longer times .    past bbn calculations for varying-@xmath0 models focused on the abundance of @xmath5  @xcite . in some ways",
    ", this keeps the physics simple , because @xmath0 should affect the @xmath2he mass fraction @xmath6 only through the neutron / proton ratio at freezeout of weak interactions before bbn  any effect on the rates of subsequent nuclear reactions is irrelevant because essentially all neutrons are gathered into @xmath2he nuclei by the end of bbn .",
    "the likely size of the effect on @xmath6 is also large compared with observational errors if @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and subscript zero denotes the present value of a quantity .",
    "more recently , bergstrm , iguri and rubinstein  @xcite ( hereafter bir ) extended the varying - alpha calculation to include other light nuclides by estimating the dependence of the charged - particle reaction rates on coulomb barrier penetration and hence on @xmath0 .",
    "however , they chose to neglect several places where @xmath0 enters the rates ( from both barrier penetration and other considerations ) , under the assumption that the exponential @xmath0 dependence in the gamow factor will dominate all other @xmath0 dependence .",
    "our work corrects these omissions , most importantly those arising from barrier penetration and from coupling of photons to nuclear currents .",
    "we also estimate the effects of final - state barrier penetration and the @xmath0 dependence of the nuclear masses .",
    "we use more elaborate models for the @xmath0 dependences of the mass-7 radiative captures , and we correct bir s use of reaction rates that were already out of date when they did their work .    finally , we elaborate the bir discussion of bbn constraints on @xmath0 , examining the region of the @xmath9 plane allowed by each of the observed light - nuclide abundances .",

    "we then discuss the prospects for producing a consistent solution , given systematic uncertainties in the observed abundances .",
    "we leave aside the question of how ( or whether ) other parameters of the standard model of particle physics vary as @xmath0 varies @xcite , though this may also affect bbn .",
    "the bbn light - element abundances , apart from @xmath2he , depend on the fine structure constant through nuclear reaction rates .",
    "calculating how these rates depend on @xmath0 is the main task undertaken by bir .",
    "charged particles must tunnel through a coulomb barrier to react at low energies , and this produces most of the energy dependence in the cross section . changing @xmath0 raises or lowers the coulomb barrier , altering the reaction rates . to describe laboratory results and compute thermally - averaged rates , it is useful to separate out the coulomb part of the energy dependence by writing the low - energy cross section as @xmath13 here , @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the reduced mass , and @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the charges of the incoming nuclei .",
    "the astrophysical @xmath18-factor @xmath19 is then usually a slowly - varying function of energy .",
    "bir calculate the @xmath0 dependences of the thermal reaction rates that result if the @xmath18-factors are assumed to be independent of @xmath0 ; _ i.e. , _ if all of the @xmath0 dependence is expressed in eqn .",

    "we have verified that their results are correct , given this assumption .",
    "however , eqn . [ eqn : sfactor ] does not explicitly contain all of the expected @xmath0 dependence , even if the only effect of changing alpha is to change the coulomb barrier",
    ". moreover , bbn takes place at relatively high energies ( a few hundred kev ) and @xmath21 is only in the range 14 in bbn , so the exponential does not dominate sufficiently to make @xmath0 dependence of the @xmath18-factor completely negligible by comparison .",
    "if bbn involved energies a factor of two lower or nuclei with only slightly larger charges , corrections to the bir treatment would be negligible .",
    "the first source of @xmath0 dependence in @xmath19 is coulomb barrier penetration .",
    "cross sections are proportional to the barrier penetration factor @xmath22 : @xmath23 here , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the regular and irregular coulomb wave functions , respectively @xcite , @xmath26 is orbital angular momentum of the entrance channel , @xmath27 is the wavenumber in the entrance channel , and @xmath28 is the nuclear interaction radius .",

    "perhaps one of the pairwise combinations of abundances provides an acceptable solution that requires only plausible systematic problems with the third observed abundance .",
    "because the d+@xmath1li solution requires such a stretch to match the @xmath2he observations , we can probably rule it out .",
    "the d+@xmath2he case is interesting because it does not require an `` extreme '' value for @xmath97 .",
    "this is in the sense that existing claims for time variation in @xmath0 based on metal lines in quasar absorption systems are on the order of @xmath140 .",
    "the best fits for bbn with d and @xmath2he only are at @xmath141 , @xmath142 ( it ) and @xmath143 , @xmath144 ( oss ; all errors @xmath145 ) .",
    "these solutions have the advantage of agreeing with the value of @xmath124 derived from observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "however , @xmath1li / h is discrepant by a factor of 23 , so this is no better than the standard @xmath146 case in its need for a greatly underestimated primordial @xmath1li / h .    the final pair of abundances available is @xmath2he+@xmath1li .",
    "any @xmath2he constraint crosses both curves defined by the @xmath1li constraint , and either of the two @xmath2he data sets could be correct .",
    "there are thus four different solutions we could consider , but it should suffice to say that they all favor @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "the solution least discrepant from the d / h data requires d / h=@xmath149 , more than twice the current best observational average and greater than the highest value presently claimed .",
    "thus , given the present observational data for light - element abundances , allowing @xmath0 to vary does not allow bbn to fit the data in a way that is convincingly better than in the simplest @xmath146 case .",
    "the existing discrepancies between the light - nuclide abundances and the detailed predictions of bbn are better - explained in terms of systematic effects than in terms of varying @xmath0 .",
    "the above analysis produces two plausible constraints on @xmath114 : one based on deuterium that derives its strength from the simplicity of the d / h measurement ( fig .",
    "[ fig : d ] ) , and one based on @xmath2he that derives its strength from the presumptive strong dependence of @xmath6 on @xmath114 ( fig . [ fig:4he ] ) .",
    "the constraint based on @xmath2he which was derived in bir remains the best that one can do to constrain @xmath114 independent of any other parameter , with the _ caveat _ that the nucleon mass splitting is not well - understood , and so the constraint could be much weaker than it appears . the constraint based on d / h is perhaps more secure because the varying-@xmath0 d / h yields depend on relatively well - understood physics and because the d / h measurement is in principle relatively free of systematic pitfalls : it involves demonstrably pristine material , and it does not depend on radiative transfer or ionization corrections .",
    "the deuterium constraint may be expressed as @xmath150 at @xmath145 , but it has the disadvantage that one can obtain large variations in @xmath0 merely by adjusting @xmath10 . given the large regions of high confidence level in fig .",
    "[ fig:7li ] , @xmath1li does not provide a useful constraint by itself .",
    "we note that the joint constraint from d / h and the it value of @xmath6 was also examined in ref .",
    "these authors obtained a result of @xmath151 ( compared with our @xmath142 for this case ) , and identical limits on @xmath124 to those found here .",
    "one would expect differing values of @xmath97 between their analysis and ours : in our calculation , d / h depends more weakly on @xmath97 , and the updated laboratory cross section for the crucial @xmath152 cross section is lower than what they used .",
    "it appears that these two effects have cancelled by chance at the best - fit solution .",
    "( @xmath2he should behave the same way in both calculations , because we have used the same value of @xmath121 ) .",
    "the differing error limits result from a combination of the weaker dependence of @xmath152 on @xmath97 in our treatment , the inclusion of a 9% cross section uncertainty on our predicted d / h , and the 30% uncertainty that we have assigned to @xmath121 .",
    "finally , an independent constraint on @xmath124 now exists from measurements of cmb anisotropies .",
    "the current results are @xmath153 from boomerang @xcite , @xmath154 from dasi @xcite , and @xmath155 from maxima @xcite ( all @xmath156 errors ) .",
    "a single direct measurement of @xmath124 is a vertical line in figs .",
    "[ fig : d][fig:4he ] .",
    "values of @xmath114 based on these measurements and the individual light - nuclide abundances are shown in table [ tab : deltas ] .",
    "a firm value of @xmath97 may not be derived from this table , because the relative reliabilities of the inferred primordial abundances are not known . however , a general trend is clear : only the combination @xmath1li / h + maxima or the combination of oss @xmath2he with any of the cmb data provides any strong indication of @xmath157 .",
    "for all other data , the @xmath145 limits either include @xmath112 or nearly include it ( missing by 10% or less of the best - fit value ) .    in principle",
    ", the estimation of @xmath124 from cmb measurements also depends on the value of @xmath0 at matter - radiation decoupling @xcite , @xmath158 .",
    "this may be included among the parameters to be determined jointly from the cmb , or some value may be assumed as a prior .",
    "the results quoted above and used to derive table [ tab : deltas ] are based on the assumption that @xmath159 .",
    "the values of @xmath158 and @xmath114 may have nothing to do with each other : @xmath0 may evolve between these events .",
