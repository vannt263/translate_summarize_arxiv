    "by now , direct methods of determination of various plasma characteristics , based on quantum or classical statistical mechanics , have been developed only for practically fully ionized plasmas @xcite . in the case of dense partially ionized plasmas , where the density of neutral particles ( atoms ) is close to the density of positively charged particles ( ions ) ,",
    "such rigorous methods do not exist at present .",
    "recently , in @xcite , this problem was discussed in connection with the transport properties of dense partially ionized plasmas . as for their optical characteristics ,",
    "it is enough to remind that adequate calculation methods exist only for weakly and moderately ionized plasmas with electron density @xmath3 .",
    "as it is well known , the influence of the neighborhood on an exited atom can be neglected in such plasmas , as for example in the solar photosphere @xcite , or be treated as a small perturbation and described within the framework of a perturbation theory @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will consider the continuous absorption of em ( electromagnetic ) radiation in dense partially ionized plasma , with electron density @xmath4 , temperature @xmath5 and atom density @xmath6 .",
    "plasmas with similar parameters are of interest from both the laboratory @xcite and the astrophysical aspect . here",
    "we keep in mind the plasma of the inner layers of the solar atmosphere , as well as of partially ionized layers of other stellar atmospheres , for example the atmospheres of da and db white dwarfs with effective temperatures between @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( see @xcite ) .    due to the exceptional simplicity of the hydrogen atom ,",
    "this research is starting with the hydrogen case . under the mentioned conditions the continuous absorption of em radiation in hydrogen plasmas",
    "are determined by the following radiative processes : @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the energy of a photon with wavelength @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 - the principal and the orbital quantum number of hydrogen - atom excited states , @xmath17 and @xmath18- free electrons with energies @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively , @xmath21 the electron mass and @xmath22 - plank s constant .    in the considered region of @xmath23 and",
    "@xmath24 the processes of electron-@xmath25 and electron-@xmath26 inverse bremsstrahlung , photo - detachment of the negative ion @xmath27 , @xmath26-@xmath25 absorption charge exchange and photo - dissociation of molecular ion @xmath28 , which are described by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : inbs ] ) , ( [ eq : eh ] ) and ( [ eq : hh ] ) , can be treated in the same way as in previous papers @xcite .",
    "therefore , photo - ionization processes ( [ eq : ph ] ) will be in the focus of attention in the next section , and here let us note only that in this field methods obtained by extrapolation ( with minor modifications ) of the methods developed for weakly and moderately non - ideal plasmas @xcite have been used for such processes up until now .",
    "moreover , for determination of absorption coefficients characterizing their influence in the region of @xmath29 methods based on cramer s approximation @xcite have been used so far .",
    "so , developing a new modeling way of describing the continual absorption in dense partially ionized plasmas , which is the main aim of this paper , is still an actual task .",
    "we take as the landmarks hydrogen plasmas which were experimentally studied in @xcite : with @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively . the presented modeling way is tested within the optical range of photon wavelengths : @xmath34 .",
    "a key parameter of the used numerical procedure is determined empirically .",
    "it is shown that this procedure already allows for determination of the spectral absorption coefficients characterizing all the relevant absorption processes in dense partially ionized hydrogen plasmas , at least in the regions @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the material of this paper is distributed over sections 2 and 3 . in sec .",
    "2 the following is presented : the approximation of the cut - off coulomb potential , together with the reasons for applying just this approximation in the considered regions of @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; the way of obtaining all the partial spectral absorption coefficients , as well as their corresponding final expressions . in sec .",
    "3 the results of the calculations of the partial and the total absorption coefficients are presented and discussed .",
    "let us note that numerous papers dedicated to development of rather rigorous methods of ground - state and exited - atom photo - ionization processes , were published over the past few decades ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "although some of these methods were tested on the examples of isolated h - like and he atom systems , the main results of those papers are intended for more complex atoms and for atoms in extreme em fields .",
    "therefore we will consider here that an isolated hydrogen atom @xmath37 should be described in the same way as in @xcite .",
    "the appearance of these papers has certainly encouraged intensive investigation of the atom ionization processes in plasmas ( see for example @xcite ) ; however , the regions of temperature and electron density which are considered here ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) have not been examined yet .",
    "namely , the results obtained in those papers refer to the regions of extremely large electron density and temperature , where the non - relativistic way of describing plasma becomes invalid . besides , the models of ion screening which are used in the mentioned papers are not generally appropriate ( as it is being shown below ) to the considered regions of plasma parameters .",
    "that is why we examine a new modeling way here , as was already mentioned above .    in the considered hydrogen plasmas processes",
    "( [ eq : ph ] ) will present the main difficulties in describing the continuous absorption , since under the stated conditions the energy of interaction of an excited atom with its neighborhood reaches the order of the corresponding ionization potential .",
    "it means that these processes have to be considered a result of radiative transitions in the whole system `` electron - ion pair + the neighborhood '' , namely @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote the rest of the considered plasma .",
    "however , as it is well known , many - body processes can sometimes be simplified by a transformation to the corresponding single - particle processes in an adequately chosen model potential .",
    "in this context we will introduce into the consideration the ion wigner - seitz radius @xmath43 , given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the @xmath25 ion density , and the characteristic length @xmath46 is defined by the relation @xmath47 where the quantity @xmath48 has the meaning of the mean potential in which a free electron moves in the considered plasma .",
    "then , we will take into account the fact that , according to the results of @xcite , the characteristic length @xmath49 in the hydrogen plasmas which are considered here .",
    "it means that in these plasmas the radius of the zone where an ion and an electron can be treated as an electron - ion pair in eq .",
    "( [ eq : infinbf ] ) is just @xmath46 .    here , we will follow the previous papers @xcite , where it was noted that an adequate ion screening potential has to satisfy two main requirements :    \\a ) it has to be practically equal to coulomb potential ( @xmath50 ) in the mentioned zone , i.e. in the region @xmath51 ,    \\b ) outside of this zone ( @xmath52 ) it has to be practically equal to the mean potential @xmath48 ,    where @xmath53 is the distance from the considered ion , and @xmath54 - the modulus of the electron charge . condition a )",
    "is due by the fact that the averaged potential , created by the rest of the considered plasma inside the mentioned zone , where the electron of @xmath55-pair is localized , is equal to zero in the first approximation , since the rest is neutral as a whole . as for condition",
    "b ) , it reflects the fact that under such a condition a realistic , physically acceptable asymptotics is realized for the electron wave function characterizing @xmath55-pair in the considered plasma , which can not be coulomb - like as in an isolated electron - ion pair .    as an adequate model potential for hydrogen plasma with @xmath56 @xmath57 we choose , as in @xcite , the screening cut - off coulomb potential , which satisfies conditions a ) and b ) , and can be presented in the form @xmath58 where the cut - off radius @xmath46 is defined by relation ( [ eq : upc ] ) , as it is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig::1].a .",
    "this potential was first introduced to the plasma physics in @xcite and its properties were investigated later in @xcite .    in connection with such a choice of the ion screening potential",
    "let us note the following : the argumentation from @xcite is taken into account here , that the often used model of debye - h \" uckel ( dh ) potential is not adequate for description of an electron - ion pair in dense non - ideal plasma .",
    "it is important that we focus here only on the physical meaning of dh potential , leaving out of the consideration all of its disadvantages , which have been noted and discussed in @xcite ; namely , as it is well known , dh potential has the meaning of an average electrostatic potential created by the observed ion and all the charged particles from the rest of the plasma .",
    "this potential was introduced in @xcite in order to describe ( in accordance with its meaning ) some of the thermodynamical characteristics of free - particle systems with coulomb interaction . from this aspect ,",
    "its applications have been justified until now , if the accuracy of the calculations is not very important @xcite .",
    "let us note also that in order to reduce errors which are generated by the application of dh potential , instead of dh screening radius @xmath59^{1/2}$ ] for two - component ( electron - ion ) plasma , another radius @xmath60 is often taken , given by    @xmath61^{1/2},\\ ] ]    which in principle characterizes the corresponding single - component system .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that replacing @xmath62 with @xmath60 is really justified in weakly non - ideal plasmas , since the adequate screening radius is approaching just @xmath60 when the non - ideality degree is approaching zero . here",
    ", it is necessary to remind that by replacing dh screening radius @xmath62 with the electron screening radius @xmath60 dh potential loses its physical meaning , becoming one of the numerous dh - like potentials .",
    "however , due to its physical meaning , dh potential could not be applied in principle to describing electron - ion scattering in dense plasmas .",
    "namely , in such plasmas the electron in the considered electron - ion pair is itself a part of the corresponding ion s `` screening cloud '' and thus takes part in the creation of dh potential .",
    "this fact is often being forgotten , but neglecting it yields an absurd situation in the case of such plasmas where dh screening radius @xmath62 is approaching the ion wigner - seitz radius @xmath43 , given by eq .",
    "[ eq : si ] .",
    "in such a case the complete ion `` screening cloud '' consists practically of one electron from the considered electron - ion pair .",
    "just this kind of situation is realized in a plasma of the kind treated in this paper , i.e. with @xmath23 of the order of magnitude of @xmath63 and @xmath24 of about 20 000k , where the ion wigner - seitz radius @xmath43 is close to the ion screening radius @xmath60 given by ( [ eq : rei ] ) , making an application of dh potential completely unacceptable .",
    "let us emphasize the fact that the same is valid for any other potential which has a similar meaning as dh .",
    "for all these reasons we consider that dh screening potentials , which were used in the above mentioned papers @xcite can not be accepted for an application in any region of plasma parameters . as for dh - like potentials , one of them",
    "could be accepted in principle for an application in some regions of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , but only under the following condition :    -the screening radius in the expression for the used potential guarantees that the values of the basic parameters of the considered problem ( number and energies of the bound states , elastic scattering amplitude for the angle equal to zero as a function of the free electron energy , etc . )",
    "are very close to the corresponding experimental data",
    ".    this condition could probably be satisfied on the condition of existence of reliable experimental data which could be used for determination of the effective screening radius by means of the corresponding fitting method , and some rigorous procedure being included for describing the bound and free states of the electron in the considered dh - like potential .",
    "however , for the considered plasmas there are no such reliable experimental data in the literature .    because of all the things mentioned we consider that the choice of the potential @xmath64 , which is given by eg .",
    "( [ eq : u ] ) , is the best solution in the case of the considered dense partially ionized plasmas . besides , an additional advantage of this model potential is possibility of obtaining all the needed final results in a compact analytical form .    as in @xcite",
    ", we will take the value @xmath48 as the zero of energy .",
    "after that , the potential eq .",
    "( [ eq : u ] ) is transformed to the form @xmath65 which is used in further considerations , and is also illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig::1].b .",
    "it is important that , through characteristic lengths @xmath43 and @xmath60 defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : si ] ) and ( [ eq : rei ] ) , the cut - off radius @xmath46 is determined here as a given function of @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "namely , taking that @xmath66 we can directly determine quantity @xmath67 as a function of the ratio @xmath68 , on the basis of the data from @xcite about the mean potential energy of an electron in singly ionized plasma .",
    "we remind that in @xcite a quantity is determined which is equal to @xmath69 ( being just designated differently ) , where @xmath70 is the mean potential energy determined within dh method @xcite .",
    "keeping in mind that @xmath71 , and taking @xmath72 , we obtain @xmath73 , and then the expression ( [ eq : pci ] ) for @xmath46 too . as , quantity @xmath74 is being determined among else in @xcite , just for the case of singly ionized plasma , so the curve in fig .",
    "2 of this paper is obtained routinely from the curve in fig 4 in @xcite , which represents quantity @xmath74 as a function of ratio @xmath68 .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath67 in a wide region of values of @xmath68 is presented in fig.[fig::2 ] .      for the sake of further considerations",
    "it is necessary to have energies @xmath75 of the bound states @xmath76 which are possible in potential @xmath77 and the corresponding radial wave functions @xmath78 , as well as the radial wave functions @xmath79 which correspond to the free states @xmath80 .",
    "these quantities are determined from schrodinger equation @xmath81= 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath82 and @xmath83 denote either @xmath75 and @xmath78 or @xmath84 and @xmath79 . here",
    "we will find the radial wave functions in the form : @xmath85 and @xmath86 , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 can be expressed through the well known analytical functions given in @xcite , namely :    - in the region @xmath89 all @xmath87 and @xmath88 with @xmath90 are expressed through the corresponding witteker s functions , and @xmath88 with @xmath91 - through coulomb - like ones which are regular at the point @xmath92 ;    - in the region @xmath93 all @xmath87 are expressed through modified bessel functions , and all @xmath88 - through spherical bessel functions .",
    "let us note that the bound - state energies ( in region @xmath94 ) and the free - state phase shifts ( in region @xmath95 ) are determined from the condition of continuity of @xmath83 and @xmath96 at the point @xmath97 .",
    "since the considered photo - ionization processes can be described in the dipole approximation ( @xmath98 ) , the corresponding cross sections , for the non - perturbed bound states in potential @xmath77 , are given by the expressions from @xcite , namely @xmath99 where @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 .",
    "as it is well known , the spectral absorption coefficient @xmath103 , characterizing the photo - ionization processes ( [ eq : ph ] ) in the case of non - perturbed energy levels in the potential @xmath77 , is given by the expression @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the partial photo - ionization cross - section defined by eq .",
    "[ eq : sig ] , @xmath106 is the density of atoms @xmath37 , and factor @xmath107 , given by @xmath108 describes the influence of the stimulated emission .",
    "one can see that this expression is similar to the one for diluted hydrogen plasma ( see for example @xcite ) and , in accordance with what was said above , it can not model the absorption coefficients of dense non - ideal plasmas described in @xcite . in order to determine the absorption coefficients @xmath109 which can be applied to the mentioned modeling , we have to take into account additional details of the atom - plasma interaction , beside those which are already described by the shape of potential ( [ eq : u0 ] ) .",
    "it is known that within the usual way ( i.e. as is being done in the cases of weakly non - ideal plasmas ) this additional influence should be characterized by shifts and broadenings of the bound - state energy levels of the considered atoms . however ,",
    "this way is generally applicable in any case , including the case of strongly non - ideal plasma too .",
    "this is confirmed by the approach of @xcite , main feature of which is treatment of electrons in existing atoms @xmath37 as a fermi gas of particles , which move in a self - consistent field created by immobile ions and other electrons .",
    "one of the results of this approach is a description of the relevant elementary event in such a gas , i.e. annihilation of an electron localized at the @xmath110-th proton in the chosen @xmath111-th state with a simultaneous creation of an electron in some free state , caused by the absorption of a photon with energy @xmath112 .",
    "namely , it was found that such an event can be described in terms of the corresponding probability density , which is practically equal to zero outside of a finite interval of free - state energies .",
    "this result , despite the fact that it has only qualitative significance , suggests that @xmath113 can be obtained by a modification of eq .",
    "( [ eq : kappaph0 ] ) based on an adequately chosen probability density @xmath114 of the perturbed atom energy levels with given @xmath15 and @xmath16 , characterized by the corresponding shifts @xmath115 and broadenings @xmath116 .",
    "it is assumed that energies @xmath117 of the perturbed atomic states are dominantly grouped around energy @xmath118 , inside the interval @xmath119 , similarly to the known cases ( gaus , lorentz , uniform etc . ) .",
    "all this justifies a semi - empirical approach to the considered problem , until a corresponding strict method is developed . in this work",
    "any @xmath120-shell ( with given @xmath15 ) of the perturbed hydrogen atom is characterized by only two quantities , namely an averaged shift @xmath121 and broadening @xmath122 , which are treated as empirical parameters .",
    "consequently , here it is considered that : @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath114 describe the corresponding uniform distribution of the perturbed energy levels , i.e. @xmath125 here we keep in mind that the uniform distribution can approximate many other distributions well ( gaussian , cupola etc . )    let us note that although @xmath121 is treated here as an empirical parameter , it is possible to describe its qualitative behaviour as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "namely , for well - known physical reasons all shifts @xmath115 , and consequently @xmath121 , have to change proportionally to the density of the perturbers , the relative atom - perturber velocity and the characteristic perturbation energy .",
    "consequently , we will have it that @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 are the characteristic electron - atom velocity and distance .",

    "the groups of three curves , which lie between the corresponding bottom and top curves , demonstrate relatively small influence of @xmath122 on the calculated values of @xmath206 : @xmath224 and @xmath225 , @xmath226 and @xmath227 for the short pulse ; @xmath228 and @xmath229 , @xmath230 and @xmath231 for the long pulse .    also , the dashed curves on figs .  5 and 6",
    "demonstrate the behaviour of the spectral absorption coefficient @xmath232 , defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : add ] ) and ( [ eq : ei ] ) - ( [ eq : kia ] ) , in the case of short and long pulses respectively .",
    "one can see that the total contribution of electron - ion , electron - atom and ion - atom absorption processes , described by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : inbs ] ) , ( [ eq : eh ] ) and ( [ eq : hh ] ) indeed can not be neglected in the considered cases .    figures 7 and 8 show the curves of @xmath206 calculated with the values of @xmath121 and @xmath122 which are treated as the optimal ones : @xmath233 and @xmath234 for the short pulse , and @xmath235 and @xmath236 for the long one . in order to estimate the possible error due to such a choice of shifts and broadenings , the results of calculations are shown in figs .  9 and 10 in the case when @xmath121 decreases with the increase of @xmath15 , proportionally to the ionization energies of the corresponding atomic levels .",
    "let us note the fact that calculated curves presented in these figures correspond to the optimal values of @xmath237 and @xmath238 .",
    "one can see that the calculated curves in figs .",
    "9 and 10 are very close to the calculated curves in figs .  7 and 8 , respectively .",
    "this fact is reflected in the values of @xmath237 and @xmath238 which correspond to the curves in figs .  9 and 10 : @xmath239 and @xmath240 for the short pulse , and @xmath241 and @xmath242 for the long one .    beside the curves @xmath206 and @xmath215 ,",
    "the curves @xmath243 are also presented in figs .",
    "7 and 8 , which were obtained in @xcite for the short and long pulse on the basis of the perturbation theory used in @xcite . for the sake of correct interpretation of the presented data , let us note the fact that the values of @xmath243 , similarly to @xmath215 , characterize not only photo - ionization , but also the bound - bound ( photo - excitation ) processes , which are not considered in this work",
    "one can see that in the case of strongly non - ideal plasmas ( short pulse , @xmath244 ) the difference between @xmath215 and @xmath243 is so large that it justifies any effort towards development of an alternative method of calculation of the strongly non - ideal plasma absorption coefficient .",
    "however , in the case of long pulse ( @xmath245 ) the considered plasma is located by its parameters in the lower part of the region of strong non - ideality , where the perturbation theory should give much better results .",
    "this fact is reflected in a significant reduction of the difference between @xmath215 and @xmath243 .",
    "therefore it is important to check whether relation eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltan ] ) is valid also for @xmath23 close to @xmath246 .",
    "since in the case of constant shifts @xmath247 and @xmath248 for short and long pulses respectively , validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltan ] ) means that @xmath249 , which is satisfied with an accuracy better than @xmath250 . in the case of variable shift",
    "we have it that @xmath239 and @xmath251 for the short and long pulse respectively , and validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltan ] ) means now that @xmath252 , which is satisfied with the same accuracy .",
    "this fact offers a possibility to determine @xmath121 or @xmath237 for any @xmath23 and @xmath24 from intervals @xmath253 and @xmath254 , and probably in some significantly wider regions , at least for @xmath255 and @xmath256 .",
    "then , since it has been established that the influence of @xmath122 is significantly weaker than the influence of @xmath121 , we can determine @xmath122 for any @xmath23 from those intervals , taking @xmath257 , as in the examples illustrated by the dashed curves on figs .",
    "[ fig::7 ] and [ fig::8 ] .    * * *    on the grounds of all that has been said one can conclude that the presented method can already be used for calculations of the spectral absorption coefficients of dense hydrogen plasmas in the regions @xmath258 and @xmath259 , as long as electron-@xmath25 and electron-@xmath26 inverse bremsstrahlung , negative ion @xmath27 photo - detachment , @xmath26-@xmath25 absorption charge exchange and molecular ion @xmath28 photo - dissociation can be described as in this paper .",
    "let us note the fact that with some modifications related to the atom photo - ionization processes , which should enable description of the influence of the atom core , the presented method can be applied to other kinds of laboratory dense hydrogen - like plasmas .",
    "most of all , we mean alkali metals , helium and other rare - gas plasmas . also , the obtained results can be of interest for some astrophysical plasmas , namely the plasma of the inner layers of solar atmosphere , as well as the plasmas of partially ionized layers of some other stellar atmospheres ( for example some da and db white dwarfs ) .",
    "further development of the method described requires first of all an improvement of the procedure used , in order to replace the semi - empirical parameters with ones determined within the procedure itself .",
    "another step would be including into consideration atom bound - bound ( photo - excitation ) processes which have been omitted here , and extending the region of the method s applicability to the long wavelengths .",
