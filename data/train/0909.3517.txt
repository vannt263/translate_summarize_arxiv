    "direct observations of galaxies at high redshift from complete , well - defined searches place strong constraints on galaxy formation and evolution models .",
    "extensive studies have been made of galaxies selected by the dropout technique out to redshift 6 ( see e.g. , @xcite ) thanks in part to the capabilities of the hst acs and nicmos cameras .",
    "studies at higher redshifts , however , have been much more challenging . in particular ,",
    "one of the key issues has been the derivation of stellar masses .",
    "these masses can provide both strong additional constraints on formation models and information about the star formation rates at even earlier times , effectively opening a window towards the earliest phases of galaxy formation .",
    "deriving masses at higher redshifts does however face some distinct challenges .    at redshifts @xmath19 , acs and nicmos only access the rest - frame uv continuum , which is not a reliable tracer of stellar mass . to obtain better constraints on this quantity through sed",
    "fits it is necessary to extend the observations to the rest - frame optical .",
    "although spitzer data presents challenges due to its large instrumental psf , these rest - frame optical measurements can be made at high redshifts with the @xmath20 m and @xmath21 m ir channels of the irac camera @xcite .",
    "the irac @xmath20 m and @xmath22 m bands probe the rest - frame optical fluxes around @xmath23 m of @xmath24 sources and reach to @xmath2526 ab mag at @xmath26 in deep @xmath2523 hr integrations .",
    "this is a remarkable achievement for a 0.8-m telescope .",
    "spitzer will continue to play a unique role in the determination of fundamental properties like ages and stellar masses of the earliest galaxies until jwst is launched .",
    "these spitzer and hst data have permitted estimates of stellar masses for large numbers ( @xmath25150 ) of @xmath275 - 6 sources @xcite .",
    "one surprising early finding was the number of quite massive @xmath28 galaxies in @xmath29 samples ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "it suggested that @xmath30 galaxies exhibited substantial amounts of star formation at much higher redshifts and earlier times , well into the epoch of reionization @xcite .",
    "these analyses have also opened the possibility of looking at the sfr - mass relation at higher redshifts , or equivalently , at the specific sfr or ssfr ( i.e. , sfr / mass ) .",
    "the ssfr tells us how fast galaxies are growing with respect to their current stellar masses .",
    "while at low redshifts ( @xmath31 ) it has been shown that galaxies grew faster in earlier times than they do today @xcite , it has been suggested that at higher redshift ( @xmath32 ) the sfr - mass relation remains much more constant @xcite .",
    "this transition in the ssfr is an interesting and important result and needs to be assessed over a long redshift baseline .",
    "it is imperative then to try to extend these studies to @xmath33 and investigate what are the characteristics of the probable progenitors of these rather massive @xmath29 sources .",
    "doing so , however , has been challenging due to the difficulty in obtaining deep enough near - ir and optical data to robustly identify @xmath0 sources .",
    "such sources only start to become `` common '' at @xmath2526.5 ab mag .",
    "thus , early selections of @xmath0 @xmath34-dropouts from the hudf only included a handful of candidates , and the situation has only improved slowly @xcite .",
    "consequently , very little has been published on the stellar masses of @xmath0 @xmath34-dropout galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed stellar population modeling of four acs -band dropout sources found in the hudf , and derived stellar masses of @xmath35 , ages of @xmath1100 - 200 myr , and was able to estimate a stellar mass density of @xmath36 mpc@xmath37 ( to @xmath38 ) .    fortunately , as a result of continued efforts to select @xmath0 galaxies from the growing quantity of deep near - ir nicmos data , bouwens et al .",
    "( 2009 , in preparation ) have succeeded in substantially expanding the size of current @xmath0 @xmath34-dropout selections , and now 14 nicmos - selected , rather luminous @xmath0 @xmath34-dropout galaxies are known that are amenable to stellar mass estimates .",
    "the recent advent of wfc3 on hst has expanded the number of known @xmath0 sources and now @xmath125 sources are known at @xmath0 ( @xcite ) .",
    "most of the newly discovered galaxies , however , are too faint to attempt stellar mass estimations on individual basis , although valuable information can be obtained from these samples through stacking analysis ( see @xcite sources .",

    "these candidates also possess very deep @xmath2523.3 hr coverage with irac from the spitzer goods program and present us with a unique opportunity to better understand what the typical properties ( ages , stellar masses ) of @xmath0 @xmath34-dropouts are .    here",
    "we take advantage of the larger sample of 14 -dropout sources identified by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2009 , in preparation ) to estimate the typical properties of @xmath0 galaxies .",
    "the much larger size of current samples allows us to get a better handle on the typical properties of @xmath0 galaxies than was possible from the smaller and brighter samples previously available @xcite .",
    "for example , sizeable variations in the m / l ratios of individual galaxies can considerably skew the averages for the population as a whole .",
    "the present sample also include galaxies from two independent lines of sight , i.e. , the hdf - north goods and cdf - south goods , so the results should be much less impacted by cosmic variance and more representative of the cosmic average . in estimating the rest - frame optical fluxes for our @xmath0 candidates from the irac , we will take advantage of the well - tested deblending process described by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) which enables us to estimate fluxes when there is moderate overlap with nearby sources .",
    "this also allows for a larger sample , since the well - known problems with blending and confusion in irac data have limited previous studies .",
    "we provide a brief outline for this paper here .",
    "we present the sample selection and observational data we have used in this work in  2 and  3 respectively . in  4 , we will describe the photometry of the sample with particular emphasis in the deblended photometry from the irac channels .",
    "we devote  5 to a discussion of the photometric redshifts obtained and possible contamination and in  6 we present the procedure and results in the process of fitting synthetic stellar populations to the observed seds ( including our ssfr results ) . ",
    "7 presents our estimated stellar mass density ( smd ) at @xmath0 and confidence intervals .",

    "this technique uses a segmentation map created by @xmath55 @xcite to define the boundaries of each source in the area to be cleaned ( we use a 2@xmath57 threshold to ensure all the possibly relevant neighbors are fitted ) and use the light profiles of the sources within those boundaries as the empirical light profiles ( assuming a similarity between the profiles at both 1.6  @xmath2 m and @xmath20 m ) .",

    "these libraries show almost no difference with respect to the newest charlot & bruzual ( 2007 ) ( cb07 , e.g. @xcite ) and have been shown to be in reasonable agreement with other libraries ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we use a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) between 0.1 and 100 m@xmath97 and sub - solar metallicity ( 0.2 z@xmath98 ) so that comparisons to existing works are more straightforward .",
    "our selection of sub - solar metallicity models is based on the observed trends at high redshifts ( e.g. maiolino et al 2008 ) as well as on the direct observations of extremely blue uv slopes of the most recently found @xmath0 sources ( bouwens et al .",

    "we have good reasons for making this assumption . @xmath156",

    "we have tested the impact of allowing modest amounts of extinction ( a@xmath160 ) to the models and found that the main results ( smd , ssfr , ages ) are unchanged or at least consistent within the uncertainties .    within these general specifications , we explored a wide variety of different parameters ( redshift , age ) in modeling the observed photometry of each @xmath0 candidate : @xmath161 ) } & = & 7.5 - age_{max } { \\rm ~(steps~of~0.01 ) } \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath162 is the age of the universe at the corresponding redshift so that the models avoid solutions in which the populations are older than the universe . to derive 68% , 95% , and 98% confidence intervals for the above parameters , we ran a number of simulations where we added photometric scatter ( noise ) to the observed fluxes and then used the results to determine the threshold @xmath95 values that encompass these confidence intervals .",
    "we performed the above calculations with the stellar population modeling code named fast ( see appendix in @xcite ) .",
    "note that in stellar population modeling , we do not use the photometric redshift estimates from the previous section .",
    "this was to avoid additional complications in the definition of the confidence intervals ( as the templates are slightly different ) .",

    "the ages in that table correspond to the average age of the stellar population , i.e. , @xmath164 ( = age@xmath165 ) . in the case of constant sfr models , this is simply equal to one half of the time elapsed since the onset of star formation .",

    "the uncertainties in the derived age , however , are quite substantial , typically @xmath167 ( 68% confidence intervals ) . from table",

    "such constraint implies insignificant fractions of stellar mass assembled at extreme redshifts .      in the above stellar population modeling",
    ", we adopted a salpeter imf and assumed sub - solar metallicity ( 0.2z@xmath98 ) .",
    "we also explored the effects of using a chabrier imf and of varying the metallicity of the models .",
    "we find that while distribution of best fit redshifts and ages is unchanged , the derived masses are @xmath145% smaller if we use chabrier imf ( instead of salpeter ) , and 10% larger if we consider models with solar metallicity ( instead of 0.2@xmath170 ) .",
    "for both metallicities ( 0.2 @xmath171 and @xmath172 ) and both imfs ( chabrier and salpeter ) , we obtain reasonable @xmath95 fit results , so there is no reason to prefer one imf or metallicity over the others .",

    "however , this extinction is not very well constrained for individual @xmath0 galaxies ( which lack strong constraints on their @xmath157-continuum slopes ) , and so it is worthwhile to mention how larger values of the dust extinction would affect the ages and stellar masses derived from our modeling . imposing an extinction of @xmath173 ( following calzetti et al",
    "2000  we consider this a safe upper limit based on the previously mentioned studies ) , yields best fit models that are @xmath174 more massive ( to compensate for the dimming ) but @xmath175 younger ( which prevents their @xmath176 $ ] colors from becoming too red to match the observations ) with the consequent increase in sfr .",
    "we also find reasonable @xmath95 for these models .    finally , we must remember that we adopted a specific form for the star - formation history  supposing the sfr for each was constant in time .",
    "we could easily have adopted other star formation histories ( instantaneous burst , exponentially decaying ) in fitting the observed seds and found acceptable results . to determine the approximate effect of the star formation history on our derived parameters , we also considered exponentially decaying @xmath177 histories and instantaneous bursts in modeling our sources .",
    "in general we found larger ages and masses for histories with larger @xmath178 s ( where @xmath178 for a constant sfr model is of course @xmath179 and 0 for an instantaneous burst ) though all assumed histories produced acceptable fits . in that sense , the unrealistic instantaneous burst models provide a lower limit for the age@xmath165 of the sample that we find to be 80 myr . using a more reasonable approximation like @xmath180 myr",
    "this number goes up to @xmath181 myr .",
    "this latest result would imply that we are observing a quiescent population right after the main star formation episode is over , which seems unlikely .",

    "to a@xmath160 produces no significant change in the derived quantities .",
    "one significant challenge in modeling the stellar populations of @xmath34-dropouts in our sample is the faintness of the sources and therefore the still sizeable uncertainties on the fluxes we derive .",
    "consequently , it becomes difficult for us to obtain tight constraints on the model parameters  like dust or age  for individual sources .",
    "we can obtain much tighter constraints on the properties of our @xmath0 galaxy candidates by averaging the measured fluxes for the sources and deriving a mean spectral energy distribution , per unit wavelength .",
    "this is particularly valuable for a determination of the @xmath157-continuum slope @xmath158 for the sample , since this slope is constrained from the @xmath183 and @xmath43-band fluxes and since the @xmath71-band flux is only poorly constrained for individual sources . to derive this mean sed , we first normalize all the sources to the average -band flux and",
    "then take a weighted mean of the fluxes of all sources ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "the mean @xmath71-band flux is derived from the 6 sources where we have deep @xmath71-band data .",
    "the sources with poor photometry ( gns - zd2 , gns - zd5  and hdfn-3654 - 1216  in 3.6 ) were not considered when taking the mean . the mean sed is presented in table  [ photometry ] and figure  [ seds1 ] .",
    "the @xmath157-continuum slope @xmath158 we estimate from the @xmath183 and @xmath71 photometry is @xmath159 .",
    "we perform the stellar population modeling for this source in the same way as for the other sources and include the estimated properties in table  [ fits ] .",
    "when modeling , however , the @xmath185 flux has not been included in the fits to minimize the influence of our lowest redshift sources .",
    "the best - fit model is also compared with the mean sed in figure  [ seds1 ] .",
    "if we allow the dust reddening to be non - zero and include that in the fits , we find a best fit @xmath186 .",
    "this provides support for our assumption in  6 that our @xmath0 galaxy candidates are largely dust free . using the mass of the best fit to the mean",
    "sed ( 6.3@xmath187 ) and the extrapolated luminosity at 1500   ( 5.5@xmath188 ) we infer a mass to light ratio of @xmath189 = 0.12 @xmath190 , and also a @xmath191 = 0.28 @xmath190 ( from l@xmath192 measured from the best fit model at 5500  ) .",
    "we will use these m / l ratios to provide one estimate of the stellar mass density in  7 .",
    "a key quantity in considering the build - up of stars within a galaxy is the specific star formation rate ",
    "similar to the @xmath193 parameter which was more frequently used in the past to characterize a galaxy s star - formation history .",

    ", it makes sense for us to compare our derived ssfrs with the values at lower redshift .",

    "the results are shown in figure [ ssfr ] .    from @xmath0 to @xmath18 , there is little apparent evolution in the ssfr and the present results provide a continuation of the trend delineated by @xcite and @xcite from the @xcite points .",
    "however , from @xmath18 to @xmath205 the ssfr shows a rapid decrease .",
    "this suggests that sfr at @xmath206 mostly proceeds in a largely similar way , but that at @xmath207 there must be some physical processes inhibiting sfr .",
    "similar to many other comparisons of merit , e.g. , evolution of @xmath208 with redshift ( @xcite ) , we find that sf in galaxies at @xmath209 seems to follow somewhat different principles than for galaxies at @xmath210 .",
    "one of the most fundamental quantities we can try to infer from @xmath0 selections and the present stellar population modeling is the stellar mass density .",

    "an essential step in determining the stellar mass density from our @xmath0 @xmath34-dropout selection is obtaining an accurate estimate of the selection volume .",

    "we do so in the three different ways we detail below :    _ direct approach : _ here we estimate the stellar mass density by simply suming over the expected mass density to come from each source .",
    "the expected mass density is simply the estimated stellar mass for a source multiplied by the the likelihood it is not a contaminant ( 90% for sources in the hudf and 80% otherwise ) divided by the selection volume above .",
    "the stellar mass density we derive by summing over the 11 sources is 5.7@xmath216 .",
    "we estimate the uncertainties in the mass density by bootstrap resampling ( detailed below ) .",
    "this approach has the advantage of being very direct and even - handedly including all candidates in our selection in the estimate .",

    "if the photometric redshifts are accurate ( @xmath218 ) , then the limiting depth of our search corresponds to @xmath219 .",
    "we have then used the @xcite @xmath157 lf at @xmath0 to estimate the @xmath157 luminosity density integrated to that depth and multiplied it by the @xmath189 ratio to obtain a stellar mass density of 4.5@xmath220 .",
    "again for the uncertainties , we rely on a bootstrap resampling procedure ( below ) .",
    "_ random m / l approach : _ for our final estimate of the stellar mass density , we ran a monte - carlo simulation where we match up the 11 galaxies in our @xmath0 @xmath34-dropout sample with randomly sampled @xmath217 ratios from the 8 galaxies with reliable irac fluxes .",
    "we then divide the masses by the search volumes that correspond to their uv luminosities . after repeating the match up process 100000 times",

    "the simplest way of including all these uncertainties in our final estimate is to run a monte - carlo simulation . for each simulation , we iterate over all 11 candidates in our sample and include @xmath222 number of sources in that trial with a @xmath157 luminosity equal to that candidate  where @xmath223 is a poisson distribution with mean equal to 1 .",
    "then , we run over all the sources and give each source 10 - 20% chance of being thrown out ( to account for uncertainties in the contamination fraction ) .",
    "next , we assign a mass to each of the objects in the particular realization by drawing a random m / l@xmath224 from the observed values .",
    "when doing this , we also include individual uncertainties in the m / l@xmath224 determinations , specifically , we make a weighted choice of a mass from the distribution associated to a particular source ( with the weights derived from the @xmath95 as was already described for the determination of the ages ) .",
    "finally , we divide each source by the selection volume appropriate to its @xmath157 luminosity and sum the sources to calculate the stellar mass density for a given trial .",
    "we repeated the simulation 10000 times to ensure that our results were not limited by the number of trials .",
    "after sorting the distribution , we found that the 68% upper and lower limits on the stellar mass density were @xmath225 and @xmath226 , respectively .",
    "_ summary : _ above we derive three different estimates of the stellar mass densities with uncertainties .",
    "the estimates are 5.7 , 4.5 , and 6.6@xmath227 .",
    "all these estimates are consistent with each other but we prefer the random m / l approach because this one should be less affected by possible systematic errors in the mass derived from poor photometry .",
    "we present this stellar mass density in figure  [ smdz ] and show the previous determinations of @xcite at @xmath228 and @xcite at @xmath0 for context .",
    "we discuss differences between these stellar mass density determintions and the observed trends in  8 and  9 .",
    "we should also note here that allowing moderate extinction ( @xmath229 ) produces smd measurements that are fully consistent with the previous values ( within the uncertainties ) .",
    "the advantage of the current stellar population modeling is that it permits to estimate the sfr in our candidates at even earlier times . combining our age constraints with the estimated smd we can place limits on the sfr density at even earlier times .    in terms of the previous history ,",
    "the constant sf models imply ages of the galaxies consistent with them being in place at around @xmath230 , which combined with their assembled masses imply a very simple estimate of the average sfrd between @xmath231 . the amount of time elapsed corresponds to 300 myr and the stellar mass assembled in that amount of time is @xmath232 .",
    "this implies a sfrd of @xmath233 ( see figure  [ sfz ] ) . an extreme approach that would maximize the sfrd comes from the single burst models .",
    "simply dividing the total masses ( @xmath234 ) by the ages of the sources ( 80 myr for the single burst models ) yields an average sfrd of @xmath235 in the previous 80 myr .",
    "in general , our optical to near - ir photometry is consistent with the photometry presented in bouwens et al .",

    "we also find excellent agreement between the mid - ir irac fluxes measured for our hudf @xmath34-dropouts and those presented in @xcite .",
    "although this might not be surprising due to our use of the same technique for doing photometry , our modeling of the flux from neighboring sources ( and subsequent removal of this flux ) is completely independent .",
    "this illustrates the robustness of our method for doing photometry .",
    "an independent test of the quality of photometry can be obtained by comparing flux measurements for sources with deep irac observations taken in both goods epochs ( rotated by 180 degrees ) . in general",
    ", we observe excellent agreement between the two measurements for the five sources with two epoch data ( the four udf @xmath34-dropouts and cdfs-3225 - 4627 )  suggesting that systematics are minimal .",
    "the only exception to this is for the 3.6  measurement for gns - zd2 , gns - zd5 , and hdfn-3654 - 1216  where there are bright nearby neighbors .",
    "previously , @xcite made an estimate of the stellar mass density at @xmath0 based upon a small ( 4 galaxy ) hudf @xmath34-dropout sample .",
    "they estimated a stellar mass density of 1.6@xmath237 to @xmath160.3 @xmath238 .",
    "since we adopt a similar limiting luminosity , we can make a direct comparison with the stellar mass density estimated here .",
    "we find a fiducial value that is a about half the one estimated by @xcite .",
    "this is mostly due to our different choice of star formation histories ( we favor constant sf histories versus the average between ssp and constant sfr used in that work ) .",
    "these estimates are fully consistent within the uncertainties .",
    "this quantity was also estimated by @xcite at @xmath228 for sources in the goods fields to similar depth ( see figure [ smdz ] ) .",
    "a simple calculation shows that the observed growth in mass between @xmath0 and @xmath29 is consistent with the observed sfrd derived from the uv lf studies of @xcite .",
    "because of the broad psf in irac data , crowding is considered to be a potentially significant concern in doing photometry on faint sources , particularly when these sources are nearby bright foreground galaxies . in fact , in many studies , it is thought that perhaps @xmath150% of faint sources are sufficiently close to their neighbors that irac photometry is impossible .",
    "what do we find here ?",
    "we attempted to do irac photometry on all 11 @xmath34-dropouts in the bouwens et al.(2009 , in preparation ) , without excluding any sources due to crowding issues .",
    "of the 11 sources presented here , 5 suffered significant blending with nearby neighbors .",
    "however , as a result of our deblending technique @xcite , we were able to recover reliable fluxes for all 11 in the 4.5 @xmath2 m band and 8 of 11 ( 73% ) in the 3.6 @xmath2 m band ( excluding gns - zd2 , gns - zd5 , and hdfn-3654 - 1216which showed strong residuals from the neighbors after the subtraction process  implying large systematic errors in those two cases ) .",
    "this agrees with monte - carlo experiments that we performed that suggest that photometry is possible for @xmath2580% of faint sources and that the largest errors in the recovered fluxes should be roughly a factor of 2 .",
    "despite the large uncertainties in the derived individual masses , it seems clear now that quite massive ( @xmath239 ) systems with evolved stellar populations were already present in the universe at very early times ( @xmath0 or at least @xmath29 ) .",
    "these very massive systems likely correspond with the most massive dark matter haloes ( dmh ) and are predicted to exist but in low numbers in the standard press schechter formalism .",
    "it is hard to run simulations that can probe this very massive end of the mass function since to obtain them in larger numbers it would be necessary to run simulations with quite large volumes .",
    "@xcite ran an sph simulation with a comoving volume of @xmath240 which they find to be adequate to probe the stellar mass range @xmath241 . at the median mass of our sample of @xmath242",
    ", they find a number density of @xmath243 .",
    "more recently , choi & nagamine ( 2009 , in preparation ) , ran a simulation in a larger box of @xmath244 and find the number density at @xmath242 to be approximately one half that predicted by @xcite .",
    "given the uncertainties , these predictions agree quite well with the density of such objects that we find of @xmath245 mpc@xmath37 .",
    "although our sample may still suffer from small number statistics , the fact is that such massive objects are found to be fairly common at this early epochs and their moderately evolved seds show that their stellar populations are not pristine but were partly formed at higher redshifts .",
    "it is well known that the results ( e.g. , derived masses , sfrs , etc . ) of stellar population analyses can depend significantly on the functional form one assumes for the star formation history .",
    "some care , therefore , needs to be given to the parameterization of these histories to ensure that the conclusions drawn do not depend too much on artifacts of this parameterization .    to illustrate , there are 3 different model parameterizations of the star formation history in common use in the literature : instantaneous burst models , exponentially decay star formation models , and constant star formation models .",
    "instantaneous burst models give younger ages and lower masses than exponential decay models which in turn give younger ages and lower masses than constant star formation models .",
    "the instantaneous burst models do not seem realistic but are useful to set lower limits on the derived ages and masses .",
    "exponential decay models are the most popular in the literature ( e.g. @xcite )  perhaps because of their versatility in modeling a wide range in star formation histories  but give rise to a troubling prediction , namely , that the star formation rates of galaxies are larger in the past .",
    "this prediction is troubling because it contradicts both the observed and predicted trend that the sfr density of the universe increases with cosmic time .",
    "given these concerns , we prefer to model the stellar population of high - redshift galaxies with constant star formation histories .",
    "the reason for this preference is as follows : first , constant star formation models do not naturally predict that the sfr density will be greater at early times , as exponentially decaying models do .",
    "second , constant star formation models do not predict a large population of uv luminous sources at earlier times as found from exponentially - decaying models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is more consistent with the observation that such sources are not found in large numbers at @xmath0 .",
    "third , constant star formation models are more consistent with the low evolution seen in the specific star formation rate ( e.g. , figure [ ssfr ] here ,  6.2 , and as discussed by @xcite ) .",
    "we realize that _ some _ luminous galaxies may have mass - to - light ratios suggesting their sfrs were higher in the past , but we suspect this may be a duty cycle issue that is due to feedback , etc .",
    "these galaxies are simply experiencing a period where their sfrs are less than their norm .",
    "as outlined in  7.3 , the stellar population modeling we do of @xmath0 galaxy candidates allow us to estimate the sfr density at even earlier times .",
    "having an estimate of this sfr density is valuable since it allows us to assess how much ionizing radiation the star - forming population at @xmath56 might likely produce  and hence repose the question about whether z@xmath256 galaxies are capable of keeping the universe reionized . from absorption studies to bright @xmath29 qsos , the process of reionizing the hydrogen of the universe was just ending at @xmath29 @xcite while the five year wmap results suggest it began at least as early as @xmath246 @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented a prescription to estimate the critical density of uv radiation necessary to reionize the universe at a given redshift .",
    "updated to a more current cosmology @xcite , that formula becomes : @xmath247 at @xmath248 , for an escape fraction @xmath249 ( e.g. @xcite ) , and for a clumping factor @xmath250 ( but see @xcite who suggest @xmath251 ) the value of of @xmath252 .",
    "the sources capable of producing such radiation , however , remain unknown but young o and b stars in early galaxies stand out as the most likely candidates given the observed decrease in the number density of quasars at high redshifts .",
