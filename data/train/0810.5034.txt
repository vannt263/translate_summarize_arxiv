    "open quantum systems are ubiquitous in the sense that any system can be thought of as being surrounded by its environment ( reservoir or bath ) which influences its dynamics .",
    "they provide a natural route for discussing damping and dephasing .",
    "one of the first testing grounds for open system ideas was in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "its application to other areas gained momentum from the works of caldeira and leggett @xcite , and zurek @xcite , among others .",
    "the total hamiltonian is @xmath1 , where @xmath2 stands for the system , @xmath3 for the reservoir and @xmath4 for the system - reservoir interaction .",
    "the evolution of the system of interest @xmath2 is studied taking into account the effect of its environment @xmath3 , through the @xmath4 interaction term , making the resulting dynamics non - unitary .",
    "depending upon the system - reservoir ( @xmath5 ) interaction , open systems can be broadly classified into two categories , viz . , quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) , which we consider here , or dissipative ( cf .",
    "for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) . a particular type of quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) @xmath5 interaction is given by a class of energy - preserving measurements in which dephasing occurs without damping the system , i.e. , where @xmath6   =   0 $ ] while the dissipative systems correspond to the case where @xmath6 \\neq 0 $ ] resulting in decoherence along with dissipation @xcite .    a class of observables that may be measured repeatedly with arbitrary precision , with the influence of the measurement apparatus on the system being confined strictly to the conjugate observables , is called qnd or back - action evasive observables @xcite .",
    "such a measurement scheme was originally introduced in the context of the detection of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "the energy preserving measurements , referred to above , form an important class of such a general qnd measurement scheme .",
    "the interest in the relevance of open system ideas to quantum information has increased in recent times because of the impressive progress made , and the potential for future progress ( cf .",
    "for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) , on the experimental front in the manipulation of quantum states of matter towards quantum information processing and quantum communication .",

    "@xcite demonstrated and completely characterized a qnd scheme for making a nondeterministic measurement of a single photon nondestructively using only linear optics and photo - detection of ancillary modes , to induce a strong nonlinearity at the single photon level .",
    "the dynamics of decoherence in continuous atom - optical qnd measurements has been studied in @xcite .",
    "quantum entanglement is the inherent property of a system to exhibit correlations , the physical basis being the non - local nature of quantum mechanics @xcite , and hence is a property that is exclusively quantum in nature .",
    "entanglement plays a central role in quantum information theory @xcite , in quantum computation as in the shor algorithm @xcite , and quantum error correction @xcite .",
    "a number of methods have been proposed for creating entanglement involving trapped atoms @xcite .",
    "an important issue is to study how quantum entanglement is affected by noise , which can be thought of as a manifestation of an open system effect @xcite .",
    "a recent experimental investigation of the dynamics of entanglement with a continuous monitoring of the environment , i.e. , via a realization of quantum trajectories @xcite , has been made in @xcite .",
    "here we study the effect of noise on the entanglement generated between two spatially separated qubits , by means of their interaction with the bath , which is taken to be in an initial squeezed - thermal state @xcite .",
    "this is of relevance to evaluate the performance of two - qubit gates in practical quantum information processing systems .",
    "the two qubits are intially uncorrelated . with the advent of time entanglement",
    "builds up between them via their interaction with the bath but eventually gets destroyed because of the quantum to classical transition mediated by the noise . in this paper",
    "we study the effect of noise generated by a qnd @xmath5 interaction .",
    "the issue of a dissipative noise is taken up in a separate work .",
    "since we are dealing here with a two qubit system which very rapidly evolves into a mixed state , a study of entanglement would necessarily involve a measure of entanglement for mixed states .",
    "entanglement of a bipartite system @xcite in a pure state is unambigious and well defined .",
    "however , mixed state entanglement ( mse ) is not so well defined .",
    "thus , although a number of criteria such as entanglement of formation @xcite and negativity @xcite exist , there is a realization @xcite that a single quantity is inadequate to describe mse .",
    "this was the principal motivation for the development of a new prescription of mse @xcite in which it is characterized not by a number , but as a probability density function ( pdf ) .",
    "this generalization provides an exhaustive and geometrical characterization of entanglement : by exploring the entanglement content in the various subspaces spanning the two - qubit hilbert space .",
    "the known prescriptions such as concurrence and negativity emerge as particular elements in the set of parameters that characterize the probability density function .",
    "we will study entanglement in the two - qubit system using concurrence as well as the probability density function .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sections ii and iii",
    ", we develop our open system model for the multi - qubit dynamics under the influence of a qnd @xmath5 interaction . section ii develops the general dynamics for a multi - qubit system , where the qubits are spatially separated and initially uncorrelated , and the bath is in a general squeezed - thermal state .",
    "section iii specializes these considerations to the case of two qubits . in section iv , we point out some interesting symmetries obeyed by the two - qubit dynamics .",
    "section v makes a brief application of the model to practical quantum communication , in particular , in the realization of a quantum repeater @xcite . in section",
    "vi , we give a brief description of the recently developed entanglement measure of mse @xcite . section vii deals with the entanglement analysis of the two - qubit open system using the pdf as a measure of entanglement .",
    "we also dwell upon the usual measure of mse , concurrence .",
    "we deal with the scenarios where the two qubits effectively interact via localized @xmath5 interactions , called the localized ( independent ) decoherence model , as also when they interact collectively with the bath , called the collective decoherence model .",
    "the usefulness of the pdf measure of entanglement is that it allows us to demonstrate the existence of noise regimes where even though entanglement vanishes , the state is still available for applications like nmr quantum computation , because of the presence of a pseudo - pure component . in section viii , as an application of the pdf , we make a brief discussion of the temperature dependent effective dynamics obeyed by the two - qubit open system in the collective decoherence regime . in section ix",

    "the basic idea is to express the pdf of entanglement of a given system density matrix ( in this case , a two - qubit ) in terms of a weighted sum over the pdf s of projection operators spanning the full hilbert space of the system density matrix .",
    "consider first a system in a state which is a projection operator of dimension @xmath187 .",
    "the pure states correspond to @xmath188 , and the completely mixed states to @xmath189 .",
    "the pdf of a system in a state which is a projection operator @xmath190 of rank @xmath191 is defined as : @xmath192 where @xmath193 is the volume measure for @xmath194 , which is the subspace spanned by @xmath195 .",
    "the volume measure is determined by the invariant haar measure associated with the group of automorphisms of @xmath193 , modulo the stabilizer group of the reference state generating @xmath196 .",
    "thus for a one dimensional projection operator , representing a pure state , the group of automorphisms consists of only the identity element and the pdf is simply given by the dirac delta .",
    "indeed , if @xmath197 , the pdf has the form @xmath198 thereby resulting in the description of pure state entanglement , as expected , by a single number . the entanglement density of a system in a general mixed state @xmath199 is given by resolving it in terms of nested projection operators with appropriate weights as @xmath200 where the projections are @xmath201 , with @xmath202 and the eigenvalues @xmath203 , i.e. , the eigenvalues are arranged in a non - increasing fashion .",
    "thus the pdf for the entanglement of @xmath199 is given by @xmath204 where the weights of the respective projections @xmath205 are given by @xmath206 .",
    "for a two qubit system , the density matrix would be represented as a nested sum over four projection operators , @xmath207 , @xmath208 , @xmath209 , @xmath210 corresponding to one , two , three and four dimensional projections , respectively , with @xmath207 corresponding to a pure state and @xmath210 corresponding to a a uniformly mixed state , is a multiple of the identity operator .",
    "the most interesting structure is present in @xmath208 , the two - dimensional projection , which is characterized by three parameters , viz .",
    "@xmath211 , the entanglement at which the pdf diverges , @xmath212 , the maximum entanglement allowed and @xmath213 , the pdf corresponding to @xmath214 .",
    "the three dimensional projection @xmath209 is characterized by the parameter @xmath215 , which parametrizes a discontunity in the entanglement density function curve . by virtue of the convexity of the sum over the nested projections ( [ nested ] )",
    ", it can be seen that the concurrence of any state @xmath199 is given by the inequality @xmath216 .",
    "thus while the concurrence for a three and four dimensional projection is identically zero , through the pdf one is able to make a statement about the entanglement content of states which span these spaces .",
    "also , as pointed out in @xcite , in the case of nmr quantum computation , concurrence and negativity are zero , whereas the pdf is able to elucidate the role of entanglement utilized by the nmr operations .",
    "these features as well as the fact that the pdf ( [ pdf ] ) enables us to study entanglement of a physical state by exploiting the richness inherent in the subspaces spanned by the system hilbert space makes the pdf an attractive statistical and geometric characterization of entanglement .",
    "we provide an explicit illustration of this in the next section .",
    "in this section , we will study the development of entanglement in the two qubit system , both for the localized as well as the collective decoherence model . recall that concurrence @xcite",
    "is defined as @xmath217 where @xmath218 are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath219 with @xmath220 and @xmath221 is the usual pauli matrix .",
    "@xmath222 is zero for unentangled states and one for maximally entangled states . in the above expression",
    ", it is implicitly assumed that @xmath199 is expressed in a seperable basis .    in figure ( [ fig :",
    "concurrence ] ( a ) ) , we plot the concurrence ( [ concur ] ) with respect to time for the case of the localized decoherence model , while figure ( [ fig : concurrence ] ( b ) ) depicts the temporal behavior of concurrence for the collective decoherence model , for different bath squeezing parameters . in all figures in this article , @xmath223 is set equal to 1.1 for the localized decoherence model and 0.05 for the collective model .",
    "it is clearly seen from the figures that the two qubit system is initially unentangled , but with time there is a build up of entanglement between them as a result of their interaction with the bath .",
    "also the entanglement builds up more quickly in the collective decoherence model when compared to the localized model .",
    "this is expected as the effective interaction between the two qubits is stronger in the collective case .",
    "another interesting feature that can be inferred from figure ( [ fig : concurrence ] ( a ) ) is the phenomena of entanglement birth and death @xcite in the localized decoherence model .",
    "figure ( [ fig : concurrence ] ( b ) ) exhibits entanglement death followed by revival , in the collective decoherence model .",
    "it is clear from the figures that bath squeezing retards the dynamical generation of entanglement .",
    "however , interestingly , it is observed that the disentanglement time is the same for different bath squeezing parameters , as in figure ( [ fig : concurrence ] ( b ) ) , while it varies for the independent decoherence model , figure ( [ fig : concurrence ] ( a ) ) .",
    "this indicates a kind of robustness of the phenomena of disentanglement with respect to bath squeezing , in the collective regime .",
    "there have been a number of investigations in the phenomena of entanglement sudden death and revival . in @xcite a study of entanglement sudden death and revival was made between two isolated atoms each in its own lossless jaynes - cummings cavity , while in @xcite the evolution of entanglement was studied via information exchange between subsystems rather than decoherence .",
    "thus these studies revealed features of the dynamics of entanglement generation in the absence of decoherence . in another study @xcite",
    "was revealed the interesting effect that irreversible spontaneous decay , due to interaction with a vacuum bath , can have on the revival of entanglement between two qubits with the collective decoherence regime being most conducive to the revival of entanglement .",
    "even though this work involved a dissipative system - bath interaction , this conclusion is supported here , for qnd interactions , as the generation of entanglement is seen to be much more effective in the collective regime when compared to the independent one .",
    "the effect of non - markovian influences , due to a dissipative interaction , on the dynamics of entanglement between two qubits was studied in @xcite for the localized decoherence model and in @xcite for the collective regime . here",
    "our study concentrates on qnd interactions and localized as well as collective regimes are treated under a common footing .",
    "now we take up the issue of entanglement from the perspective of the pdf as in eq .",
    "( [ pdf ] ) . in figures",
    "( [ fig : weights ] ( a ) ) and ( b ) , we plot the weights @xmath224 , @xmath225 , @xmath226 and @xmath227 ( [ pdf ] ) of the entanglement densities of the projection operators of the various subspaces which span the two qubit hilbert space with respect to @xmath34 for the localized and collective decoherence models , respectively .",
    "as can be seen from both the figures , with increase in temperature @xmath34 , the weight @xmath224 , depicting the pure state component monotonically decreases , while the other weights start from zero at @xmath228 and increase .",
    "eventually , the weight @xmath227 depicting a maximally mixed state would be expected to dominate , though for the parameter range used in the plots , this feature is not seen .",
    "this feature of the dynamics of the reduced two - qubit system , specially in the case of the collective decoherence model , has an interesting application which will be discussed in detail in section viii where it will be seen to obey an _ effective _ temperature dependent hamiltonian , bringing out the persistence of entanglement even at finite temperatures . in the case of the collective decoherence model , the weights @xmath225 and @xmath226 have a greater growth than that for the localized decoherence model , depicting the greater entanglement development in the collective model as is also borne out by the concurrence plots in figure ( [ fig : concurrence ] ) .",
    "as explained in section vi , the characterization of mse for a two qubit system via the pdf involves the distribution functions of four projection operators , @xmath207 , @xmath208 , @xmath209 , @xmath210 corresponding to one , two , three and four dimensional projections , respectively .",
    "these will be represented here as @xmath229 , @xmath230 , @xmath231 and @xmath232 , respectively .",
    "also , as discussed above , @xmath233 would be universal for the two qubit density matrices and would involve the haar measure on @xmath234 @xcite .",
    "consideration of the @xmath235 and @xmath236 density functions for some representative states of the two qubit system , both for the localized as well as collective decoherence models , enables us to compare the entanglement in the respective subspaces of the system hilbert space .",
    "the details of these density functions for different parameters , pertaining to the two - qubit reduced dynamics , have been presented in @xcite .",
    "figures ( [ fig : pfullt50 ] ( a ) ) and ( b ) give the full density function @xmath237 for the localized and collective decoherence models , respectively , with a bath evolution time @xmath238 and @xmath239 . for these conditions , the value of concurrence ( [ concur ] ) is 0 , which would indicate a complete breakdown of entanglement .",
    "this would be expected as with the increase in the bath temperature @xmath34 , the effect of entanglement would be destroyed quickly .",
    "this is partially borne out by the fact that for this case @xmath240 . however , as seen from figure ( [ fig : pfullt50 ] ( b ) ) , the pdf for the full density function still exhibits a rich entanglement structure , coming principally from the contributions from the one and three dimensional projections .",
    "in contrast , figure ( [ fig : pfullt50 ] ( a ) ) , for the localized decoherence model , exhibits the haar measure on @xmath234 and thus represents a maximally mixed state .",
    "figures ( [ fig : pfullt20 ] ) represents the full density function @xmath241 for the localized decoherence model with an evolution time @xmath242 , @xmath243 and bath squeezing parameter @xmath121 equal to @xmath244 , figure ( a ) , and equal to @xmath245 in figure ( b ) .",
    "this case is interesting since it is analogous to that discussed in @xcite for nmr quantum computation where concurrence would be zero , and the excess of entangled states over the unpolarized background ( exhibited by the uniform distribution coming from the density function @xmath210 , related to the fourth dimensional projection ) is exploited as a resource allowing for non - trivial gate operations , thus depicting pseudopure states over the four dimensional background , with the excess being the  deviation density matrix \" .",
    "a comparison of the two figures shows that the generation of entanglement is greater for the case of zero bath squeezing , as in figure ( b ) , when compared to the case of finite bath squeezing , figure ( a ) .",
    "in a qnd @xmath5 interaction , the reduced density matrix of the system does not approach a unique distribution asymptotically @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the pdf for the full density function ( for the collective decoherence model ) exhibits a rich entanglement structure , coming principally from the contributions from the one and three dimensional projections which carry equal weights .",
    "this feature is seen to persist for higher temperatures and evolution times , for the collective decoherence model , with the weights of the subspaces spanned by the four projection operators of the pdf remaining intact . from this",
    "emerges the fact that for the collective decoherence model , studied here , as the effect of the bath on the system increases , the pdf instead of becoming uniform , as expected , gets distributed between the subspaces spanned by the one and three dimensional projection operators suggesting a tendency of the system to resist randomization .",
    "we may ask if the description of the mixed state entanglement in terms of the probability density function which we employ here can throw , as a nontrivial application , light on the effective dynamics of the two qubit system .",
    "it has been seen in earlier studies that such a state of affairs would be encountered if the effect of the bath is not a counterpart of the collision term ( in a boltzmann equation ) , but is more like a vlasov term , causing long range mean field contributions @xcite .",
    "we analyse our system in detail below .    indeed , from the numerical results , it is not difficult to see that the effect of the bath can be mapped to a @xmath34 dependent effective hamiltonian whose energy eigenvalues scale with temperature .",
    "the eigenstates are given by the standard bell states with the ground state being @xmath246 while the orthogonal singlet state ( @xmath247 ) is the highest energy state , and is practically decoupled ( with no population ) .",
    "the next excited state is degenerate , with two bell states ( @xmath248 , @xmath249 ) spanning the two dimensional subspace .",
    "thus it follows that the effective temperature dependent hamiltonian is given by @xmath250 where @xmath251 , @xmath252 and @xmath253 are the bell states , as defined above , with eigenvalues @xmath254 , @xmath255 and @xmath256 , respectively .",
    "since the bell states are completely entangled , the effective hamiltonian has no linear terms in the qubit polarizations and has the form @xmath257 in writing which the singlet term has been dropped , as it is energetically very far separated from the other three levels .",
    "the above analysis places in perspective the surprising result that although the system is evolving , through the effective hamiltonian , the entanglement density function remains practically restricted to the 3-dimensional subspace , with a large contribution from a bell state , as the signal with the 3-dimensional background acting as noise .",
    "the restriction of the effective dynamics from four to three levels is also seen in the case of two qubit evolution via a dissipative @xmath5 interaction with a thermal bath initially at @xmath228 @xcite , for the collective decoherence model .",
    "however , there the reason for it is simply given by the fact that for the above conditions , the coupling term connecting one of the levels to the others goes to zero , thereby reducing the dynamics to that between three levels .",
    "an interesting analog of the discussion in this section comes in the work presented in @xcite .",
    "there it was shown by the authors that for the scenario where there exists a system consisting of three subsystems with the first and the third interacting with each other via their interactions with the mediating second subsystem , a signature of entanglement between the first and the third subsystems is the degeneracy in the ground state of the system .",
    "here we have a similar situation with the two qubits interacting with a bath which in turn mediates the inter - qubit interaction . from our effective hamiltonian @xmath258",
    ", we see that the first excited state ( not the ground state ) , spanned by the bell states @xmath259 and @xmath260 , is degenerate and the system exhibits a strong entanglement even at finite temperatures .",
    "another work by the same authors @xcite , studied the persistence of mixed state entanglement at finite @xmath34 .",
    "this would be important as quantum effects can be expected to dominate in regions where entanglement is nonzero .",
    "they considered the transverse ising model and studied the two - site entanglement , using concurrence as the entanglement measure , and found appreciable entanglement in the system at finite @xmath34 above the ground state energy gap , one of their motivations being the influence of nearby critical points to the finite @xmath34 entanglement .",
    "the persistence of entanglement in a two - qubit system interacting with the bath via a purely dephasing interaction ( qnd ) would suggest a broad applicability of these concepts , thereby highlighting the interconnection of ideas of quantum information to quantum statistical mechanics .",
    "in this article , we have analyzed in detail the dynamics of entanglement in a two - qubit system interacting with its environment via a purely dephasing qnd @xmath5 interaction .",
    "the system and reservoir are initially assumed to be separable with the reservoir being in an initial squeezed thermal state . since the resulting dynamics becomes mixed , in order to analyze the ensuing entanglement , we have made use of a recently introduced measure of mixed state entanglement via a pdf .",
    "this enables us to give a statistical and geometrical characterization of entanglement .    after developing the general dynamics of @xmath261 qubits interacting with their bath ( reservoir ) via a qnd @xmath5",
    "interaction , we specialized to the two - qubit case for applications . due to the position dependent coupling of the qubits with the bath",
    ", the dynamics could be naturally divided into a localized and collective decoherence regime , where in the collective decoherence regime , the qubits are close enough to feel the bath collectively .",
    "we analyzed the open system dynamics of the two qubits , both for the localized as well as the collective regimes and saw that in the collective regime , there emerges the possibility of a decoherence - free subspace for the case of zero bath squeezing .",
    "interestingly , the dynamics was found to obey a non - trivial spin - flip symmetry operation .",
    "the existence of the nontrivial spin - flip symmetry would explain the emergence of a decoherence - free subspace ( dfs ) @xcite , thereby providing a concrete instance of a dfs .",
    "we made an application of the two - qubit system to a simplified model of a quantum repeater , which can be adapted for quantum communication over long distances .",
    "we then made an analysis of the two - qubit entanglement for different bath parameters .",
    "we analyzed both concurrence as well as the pdf by finding the entanglement content of the various subspaces that span the two - qubit hilbert space .",
    "the analysis of concurrence revealed the interesting feature of so called entanglement birth and death in the localized decoherence model , while the collective model saw a subsequent revival of entanglement .",
    "reservoir squeezing was seen to hinder the generation of entanglement , though the process of disentanglement , as seen from concurrence , was robust , in the collective regime , against the effects of squeezed bath .",
    "although the pdf agrees qualitatively in its predictions with concurrence , it is able to extract more information out of the system as a result of its statistical - geometrical nature .",
    "thus we were able to consider an example analogous to nmr quantum computation , wherein the concurrence would be zero , and the excess of entangled states over the unpolarized background is exploited as a resource allowing for non - trivial quantum information processing . for the collective decoherence model",
    "the pdf for the full density function exhibits a rich entanglement structure , coming principally from the contributions from the one and three dimensional projections which carry equal weights thereby suggesting a tendency of the system to resist randomization .",
    "this feature is seen to persist even for higher temperatures and evolution times with the weights of the subspaces spanned by the four projection operators of the pdf remaining intact .",
    "the probability density description of entanglement sheds light on the underlying dynamics thereby enabling us to give an effective @xmath34 dependent dynamics in the collective decoherence regime .",
