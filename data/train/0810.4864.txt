    "the slopes of the radio and optical spectra indicate that the synchrotron peak was in the usual range where it has been observed in many previous observing campaigns , i.e. , in the infrared regime , around @xmath26  hz , corresponding to a dimensionless photon energy @xmath27 .",

    "the spectral indices are expected to be similar if the @xmath0-ray emission is produced by compton scattering in the thomson regime .",
    "if klein - nishina effects are important in the production of vhe @xmath0-rays , the resulting vhe spectrum would be even steeper than the synchrotron spectrum .",
    "as already indicated above , this would be in direct conflict with the observed relatively hard intrinsic vhe spectrum , even when corrected with a low ebl model .",

    "it is this shift of the inferred high - energy peak which will lead to quite dramatically different model implications for both leptonic and hadronic models compared to previous modeling efforts .    from the spectral upturn in the uv in the p2-spectrum in fig .",

    "in this section , we consider whether a one - zone leptonic blazar jet model can account for the february 23 , 2006 , sed of 3c279 .",
    "we consider a scenario in which a nonthermal population of ultrarelativistic electrons produces , at the same time , the synchrotron emission from radio through uv and the @xmath0-ray emission via compton scattering of soft photons off the relativistic electrons . in general",
    ", we will assume that electrons are accelerated into a power - law distribution in electron energy , @xmath37 , in the range @xmath38 .",
    "the emission region has a radius @xmath39  cm .",
    "we define an escape time scale parameter @xmath40 such that the escape time scale for relativistic electrons is @xmath41 .",
    "the interplay between radiative cooling and escape leads to the development of a spectral break in the electron spectrum at a lorentz factor @xmath42 , where the radiative cooling time scale equals the escape time scale .",
    "if the primarily injected electron distribution has a low - energy cutoff below the break lorentz factor @xmath42 ( the slow cooling regime ) , the spectral index of the electron distribution at @xmath43 is @xmath44 , while above it the spectrum is steepened to @xmath45 .",
    "however , given the steep spectral index of the optical spectrum , implying @xmath25 in the electron energy range synchrotron - radiating in the optical regime , a spectral break from @xmath46 to @xmath25 would not produce a peak in the @xmath47 spectrum at the characteristic synchrotron frequency corresponding to @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , it is more likely that the injected electron distribution has a high low - energy cutoff at @xmath48 . in this case ,",
    "particles at energies @xmath49 result only from radiative cooling from higher energies , resulting in an electron spectrum with a spectral index @xmath50 in the range @xmath51 , while above @xmath52 , we have @xmath45 , as in the slow cooling case .      in the past , vhe emission has only been observed in high - frequency peaked bl lac objects . in that case , a model interpreting the @xmath0-ray emission as synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission has proven to be very successful , although recent observations of rapid variability on time scales of a few minutes ( @xcite for pks 2155 - 304 , and @xcite for mrk 501 ) are posing serious challenges to this interpretation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the vhe emission of the intermediate bl  lac object w comae , recently detected by veritas @xcite is more plausibly explained by comptonization of an external radiation field .",
    "we point out that previous modeling efforts on 3c279 , prior to the magic detection , have concluded that an ec component is strongly preferred to explain the gev @xmath0-ray detection @xcite .",
    "however , since the magic points provide a yet unexplored new constraint on blazar models for 3c279 , it is worthwhile to revisit the ssc hypothesis in this paper",

    "this yields an estimate of the magnetic field and the doppler factor of    @xmath59",
    "this indicates that such a scenario would imply unrealistically low magnetic fields compared to standard values of @xmath60  g found from sed modeling of 3c279 in other states , as well as other blazar - type quasars .",
    "even other known tev blazars , whose seds can usually be well represented with ssc models , typically require magnetic fields of @xmath61  g , several orders of magnitude above the estimate found here for 3c279 . we therefore conclude that a one - zone ssc model for the sed of 3c279 on february 23 , 2006 , including the vhe @xmath0-ray emission is very problematic .      the leptonic external - compton scenario is based on the assumption that photons from an external , quasi - isotropic radiation field with dimensionless photon energy @xmath62 are compton - upscattered to the observed @xmath0-ray photon energies . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "if klein - nishina effects become important in the production of the vhe emission , the resulting vhe @xmath0-ray spectrum would be even steeper than the observed synchrotron spectrum , in contradiction with the observed vhe spectrum , even when corrected for the lowest plausible level of ebl @xmath5 absorption .",
    "we therefore consider here only the possibility that the vhe @xmath0-rays in a leptonic scenario are produced by thomson scattering .",
    "soft photons can be upscattered effectively in the thomson regime at most up to energies @xmath63 .",

    "such a situation would make jet confinement very problematic , and is in contradiction with model results for 3c279 in other observing epochs and for other quasar - type blazars in general , where magnetic fields of typically @xmath82  a few g are inferred , in approximate equipartition with the relativistic electron population .",
    "alternatively , forcing the system to attain approximate equipartition would require us to assume an uncomfortably high lorentz factor of @xmath83 .",
    "this choice of a bulk lorentz ( and doppler ) factor would imply @xmath84  g , and a low - energy cut - off of the injected electron population at @xmath85 .",

    "( [ bsy ] ) carries a proportionality @xmath87 .",
    "since our choice of @xmath88 is already close to the largest possible value to allow thomson scattering to tev @xmath0-rays , the assumption of a different soft photon source ( necessarily with a smaller @xmath62 ) would worsen the problem of the unusually small inferred magnetic field .",
    "it has been noted by several authors that the @xmath5 absorption of vhe @xmath0-ray photons by the radiation field of the blr may present another problem for a model of vhe @xmath0-ray emission inside the blr of luminous quasars in general ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we therefore need to investigate the effects of @xmath5 absorption in the blr radiation field for the parameters we inferred above . in @xcite ,",
    "the time - dependent @xmath5 absorption signatures of an accretion disk flare ( reflected by blr clouds ) on vhe @xmath0-ray emission were investigated .",
    "we have modified their approach for our purposes , adopting non - variable accretion - disk emission .",

    "for the extreme parameters of @xmath4 , requiring @xmath95  pc , @xmath93 , @xmath5 absorption would hardly be a problem even out to multi - tev @xmath0-ray energies , if the @xmath0-rays are produced close to the inner boundary of the blr .",
    "any level of @xmath5 absorption in the blr radiation field would imply an even higher level of intrinsic vhe @xmath0-ray emission and therefore make the requirements for jet parameters in a one - zone leptonic model even more extreme .    the red , solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fit ] shows a leptonic model calculation with parameters similar to the quasi - equipartition case outlined above .",
    "we used an equilibrium version of the time - dependent ssc + ec model of @xcite . while the optical ( synchrotron ) spectrum and the level of the vhe @xmath0-ray flux can be reproduced reasonably well , it is obvious that the x - ray flux is grossly underproduced .",
    "this is a consequence of the required , rather large low - energy cutoff at @xmath96 .",
    "the choice of a substantially lower @xmath52 would extend both the synchrotron and the @xmath0-ray spectra towards lower frequencies along the slopes of the optical and vhe @xmath0-ray spectra and would therefore produce unreasonably large infrared and mev ",
    "gev @xmath0-ray fluxes .",
    "in addition , it would require a larger jet power and therefore drive the system further out of equipartition ( towards far sub - equipartition magnetic fields ) .",
    "also , even though most of the @xmath1  gev flux is produced by compton scattering in the thomson regime , the resulting vhe @xmath0-ray spectrum appears to be steeper than the observed one , even with correction for the low ebl level according to @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that both the ssc and the external - compton scenario for a one - zone , homogeneous jet model face severe problems representing the simultaneous sed of 3c279 on february 23 , 2006 , including the vhe @xmath0-ray emission .    as noted earlier , the vhe @xmath0-ray flare was not accompanied by any remarkable optical variability",
    ". this may be another hint that in 3c279 the optical and vhe @xmath0-ray fluxes may be produced in separate emission regions .",
    "however , the calculation of the @xmath5 opacity above indicates that even an inhomogeneous leptonic jet model would face severe problems in an external - compton scenario . the dashed red curve in fig .",
    "[ fit ] indicates that an ssc model can successfully reproduce the x - ray ",
    "vhe @xmath0-ray spectrum with reasonable parameters , but fails to reproduce the optical spectrum .",

    "this would require that the vhe @xmath0-ray emission is produced far outside the blr , possibly in an internal shock scenario @xcite .",
    "this is indicated both by the @xmath5 opacity argument as well as the low required magnetic field for the ssc fit presented in fig . [ fit ] .",
    "such a model would imply that the x - ray emission is produced by low - energy electrons which have undergone substantial radiative cooling .",
    "one would therefore predict a delay of x - rays with respect to @xmath0-rays on the order of the electron cooling time scale ,    @xmath97    using the value of @xmath98  g used for the model shown in fig .",

    "if relativistic protons at energies above the threshold for p@xmath0 pion production are present in the jet of 3c  279 , hadronic interactions must be considered in blazar emission models . for the present modeling we use the hadronic synchrotron - proton blazar ( spb ) model of @xcite . in its original version ,",

    "if the gamma - ray emission region is rather close to the blr , the external photon field has to be taken into account as an additional target for particle - photon interactions and pair cascading . the observed line and disk luminosity of 3c  279 implies @xmath146 .",
    "the additional target photon field in the optical / uv band leads to enhanced reprocessing in the hadronic model , further softening the spectrum in the x - ray band .",

    "proton synchrotron radiation dominates in the @xmath0-ray band .",
    "the reprocessed component is more pronounced here than for the case of internal target photon fields only , which yields a more appropriate description of a potentially steep x - ray spectrum .",

    "the fit shown in fig .",
    "[ hfit]b presents an acceptable representation of the magic spectrum .",
    "should a higher ebl level imply a harder intrinsic vhe @xmath0-ray spectrum , this fit could be modified by choosing a lower energy density of the external radiation .",
    "parameter values for hadronic model fits are given in table [ spbparameters ] .",
    "for the fit with external photons , the injected proton energy densities are at most a factor 4 above the equipartition value and the required total jet luminosity of @xmath147 ",

    "we have presented simultaneous optical and x - ray spectral information to the recent magic detection of the quasar - type blazar 3c279 in february 2006 .",
    "the source was shown to be in an elevated optical state , but showed no substantial optical variability and a rather steep optical spectrum during the magic detection .",
    "tev flare preceded an x - ray flare by about 5  7 days .",
    "we have presented the simultaneous broadband ( optical - x - ray - vhe @xmath0-rays ) sed of 3c279 and discuss its implication for one - zone leptonic jet models .",
    "we found that an ssc model is extremely problematic as it would imply unreasonably low magnetic fields . also an external - compton interpretation has problems with an unusually low magnetic field of @xmath2  g , implying an equipartition ratio of @xmath149",
    "alternatively , approximate equipartition can be achieved with a bulk lorentz factor of @xmath83 , which appears equally unlikely .",
    "these constraints have been inferred for a correction of the vhe spectrum for @xmath5 absorption by the lowest plausible ebl model and without taking into account internal @xmath5 absorption by photons from the accretion disk or the broad - line region . any higher ebl level or a substantial amount of internal @xmath5 absorption",
    "would lead to even more extreme constraints .",
    "we therefore conclude that a simple homogeneous , one - zone leptonic jet model has serious problems reproducing the sed of 3c279 on february 23 , 2006 , which includes the recent vhe @xmath0-ray detection by magic .",
    "the lack of correlated optical ",
    "@xmath0-ray variability suggests , instead , a multi - zone model in which the optical and @xmath0-ray fluxes are produced in separate regions along the jet .",
    "we have shown that a leptonic ssc fit to the x - ray  vhe @xmath0-ray spectrum alone can be achieved with parameters quite typical for quasar - type blazars .",
    "alternatively , the hadronic synchrotron - proton blazar model is able to provide an acceptable fit to the sed of 3c279 . both a pure synchrotron - proton blazar model ( without external photons as targets for p@xmath0 pion production ) and a model with a substantial contribution from external target photons",
    "can reproduce the observed sed up to vhe @xmath0-ray energies very well . if no external photon field is included in the model ,",
    "the relevant proton synchrotron energy loss time scale is of the order of years and would therefore be inconsistent with the observed day - scale variability if proton synchrotron radiation was dominant in the x - ray regime .",
    "this model therefore requires a high internal radiation energy density in order for proton - synchrotron induced cascades to dominate the x - ray emission .",
    "alternatively , an additional target photon contribution from external sources ( in particular , the blr ) is able to overcome this problem , and such a model seems to provide an appropriate fit to the observed sed of 3c279 from optical to vhe @xmath0-rays .",
    "however , both versions of the hadronic synchrotron proton blazar model require a rather extreme jet power of @xmath7  erg  s@xmath8 . for comparison ,",
    "a multi - zone leptonic model requires a jet power in leptons alone of @xmath150  erg  s@xmath8 . when including an equal number of cold protons , the total jet power requirement increases to @xmath151  erg  s@xmath8 .",
    "we point out that our conclusions are based on rather incomplete frequency coverage during the magic detection , and rely on the apparent similarity of the sed , at least from radio through x - rays , with previously observed high states of 3c279 during the egret era .",
