    "over the years , the study of current noise and noise correlations has become a respected and useful diagnosis for transport measurements on mesoscopic conductors .",
    "theoretically , noise was first computed mostly for non  interacting systems @xcite .",
    "however , it soon became clear that low frequency noise could be used to isolate the quasiparticle charge @xcite and to study the statistical correlations @xcite in specific quasi one  dimensional correlated electron systems , such as the edge waves in the quantum hall effect . in these chiral luttinger liquids ,",
    "the charge of the collective excitations along the edges corresponds to the electron charge multiplied by the filling factor .",
    "attention is now turning towards conductors  individual nano - objects  which occur naturally , and which can be connected to current / voltage probes in order to perform a transport experiment .",
    "the crucial advantage of such nano  objects is that they are essentially free of defects and in some circumstances they have an inherent one dimensional character . carbon nanotubes constitute the archetype of such 1d nano - objects : single wall armchair nanotubes have metallic behavior , with two propagating modes at the fermi level .",
    "incidentally , electronic correlations are known to play an important role in such systems .",
    "carbon nanotubes seem to constitute good candidates to study luttinger liquid behavior .",
    "in particular , their tunneling density of states  and thus the tunneling @xmath0 characteristics is known to have a power law behavior @xcite in accordance with luttinger liquid theory .",
    "8 cm    luttinger models for nanotubes differ significantly from their quantum hall effect counterpart , because of their non - chiral character . forward and",
    "backward fields describing collective excitations effectively mix , because the interactions between electrons are spread along the whole length of the nanotube . for this reason",
    ", a straightforward transposition of the results obtained for chiral edge system proves difficult .",
    "nevertheless , non  chiral luttinger liquids can be described with chiral fields @xcite .",
    "such chiral fields correspond to excitations with anomalous ( non - integer ) charge , which has eluded detection so far .    in the present work ,",
    "we propose an experimental geometry which allows to probe directly the underlying charges of the collective excitations .",
    "the setup consists of a nanotube whose bulk is contacted by a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) tip which injects electrons , while both extremities of the nanotube collect the current ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the current , the noise and the noise correlations are computed , and the effective charges are determined by comparison with the schottky formula @xcite for an `` infinite '' nanotube , the striking result is that noise correlations contribute to second order in the electron tunneling , in sharp contrast with a fermionic system which requires fourth order .",
    "the noise correlations are then positive , because the tunneling electron wave function is split in two counter propagating modes of the collective excitations in the nanotube .",
    "we conjecture that in the presence of 1d fermi liquid leads , modeled as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the absence of renormalization / interaction effects of the nanotube is recovered .",
    "a recent two terminal experiment studied the current  current fluctuations in ropes of nanotubes @xcite .",
    "there , it is pointed out that the strong reduction of the low frequency noise can not be understood within the context of scattering theory @xcite .",
    "naive comparison with existing non - chiral luttinger liquid models @xcite would imply an interaction parameter much inferior to the free electron case .",
    "also , we mention that other multi - terminal geometries where a nanotube or a one  dimensional wire is attached to more than two leads , have been considered @xcite . our proposal deals with the same geometry as ref @xcite , where a renormalization analysis identified the exponents of the current voltage characteristics",
    ". however , here the emphasis is put on the low frequency current fluctuation spectrum , both for the autocorrelation and the cross correlations between the two ends of the nanotube .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the hamiltonian of our setup is specified in the next section , followed by a general non - equilibrium scheme based on the keldysh formalism to study transport in this device , which is independent of the type of leads chosen ( sect .",
    "results for a nanotube connected to leads are then presented in sect .",
    "4 . a connection with the effective charges of refs .",
    "@xcite is established in sect .",
    "the transport geometry ( fig . [ fig1 ] ) implies tunneling from the tip ( normal or ferromagnetic metal ) to the nanotube , and subsequent propagation of collective excitations along the nanotube . in the absence of tunneling ,",
    "the hamiltonian is thus simply the sum of the nanotube hamiltonian , described by a two mode luttinger liquid , together with the tip hamiltonian . using the standard conventions @xcite , the operator describing an electron with spin @xmath1 moving along the direction @xmath2 , from mode @xmath3 is specified in terms of a bosonic field : @xmath4 with @xmath5 a short distance cutoff , @xmath6 the fermi momentum , @xmath7 the momentum mismatch associated with the two modes , and the convention @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are chosen for the direction of propagation , for the nanotube branch , and for the spin orientation .",
    "it is convenient to express this bosonic phase in terms of the conventional non - chiral luttinger liquid fields @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with @xmath13 identifying the charge / spin and total / relative fields : @xmath14 with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 et @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 are dual non - chiral fields .",
    "a plausible alternative would have been to express @xmath19 in terms of the chiral luttinger liquid fields .",
    "however , the present choice will be simpler later on when dealing with inhomogeneous luttinger liquids ( in order to include the leads ) , as the green s functions for @xmath11 , @xmath12 are known .",
    "the hamiltonian which describes the collective excitations in the nanotube has the standard form : @xmath20 with an interaction parameter @xmath21 and velocity @xmath22 .    for the stm tip",
    ", one assumes for simplicity that only one electronic mode couples to the nanotube .",
    "the tip can thus be described by a semi - infinite luttinger liquid , as in kondo type problems .",
    "this turns out to be convenient in this problem where both bosonized nanotube fermions operators and tip fermions operators intervene . for the sake of generality , we allow the two spin components of the tip fields to have different fermi velocities @xmath23 , which allows to treat the case of a ferromagnetic metal .",
    "the fermion operator at the tip location @xmath24 is then : @xmath25 here , @xmath26 is the chiral luttinger liquid field , whose keldysh green s function at @xmath24 is given by @xcite : @xmath27   u_f^{\\sigma}(t_1-t_2)/2a\\right\\}~ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 refer to the upper or lower branch of the keldysh contour .",

    "we will use the convention @xmath36 .",
    "similarly , the tunneling current is defined as : @xmath37^{(\\varepsilon ) } ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in eqs .",
    "( [ fermion_nanotube ] ) and ( [ fermion_stm ] ) , we have omitted the klein factors which guarantee the anti - commutation of the 3 types of fermions operators  written in terms of bosonic fields  for this problem : the two nanotube branches and the stm single mode .",
    "it has been established @xcite that klein factors are in principle necessary to treat multi - luttinger system , as illustrated in the computation of noise correlations between three edge states in the fqhe . in the present work ,",
    "klein factors can be dropped because we intend to work with lowest order perturbation theory . to order @xmath38",
    ", statistical correlations between the three luttinger systems do not occur .",
    "however , they should show up when calculating higher order corrections ( @xmath39 ) .    for this problem which implies propagation along the nanotube , it is also necessary to compute the ( total ) charge and ( total ) spin currents using the bosonized fields of eq .",
    "( [ fermion_nanotube ] ) : @xmath40 similarly , we consider the spin current in the @xmath41 direction : @xmath42 note that the contribution from terms containing @xmath43 oscillations has been dropped .",
    "this is equivalent to requiring that the current measurement along the nanotube is effectively a spatial average over a length scale larger than @xmath44 . in practice ,",
    "@xmath43 terms are necessary in order to establish a connection between current fluctuations and density fluctuations .",
    "in this section , the general approach used to calculate the tunneling current and noise , as well as the current and noise in the nanotube is described .",
    "all quantities are computed at zero temperature for simplicity .",
    "the calculation of the tunneling current and noise is quite similar to the perturbative results in ref .",
    "@xcite for the fqhe . here",
    "it is summarized in order to compare with the nanotube transport quantities .",
    "the keldysh technique is used to compute the average tunneling current and noise .",
    "we adopt the convention that the coefficients @xmath45 identify the upper / lower branch of the keldysh contour : @xmath46 which applies in typical tunneling situations where the product of the current averages is of order @xmath39 . in order to collect the lowest order contribution in the tunneling amplitude , the exponential",

    "( [ intermediate_tunneling_current ] ) and ( [ intermediate_tunneling_noise ] ) is the tip fermion green s function .",
    "next the nanotube and tip fields are specified in terms of the bosonized fields ( nonchiral and chiral ) , and the two keldysh ordered exponential products are computed : @xmath48 as expected , the stationary current and the real time current correlator call for the time differences @xmath49 , @xmath50 only . integrating over time",

    "the operator averages along the nanotube require a perturbative calculation up to second order in the tunneling hamiltonian for the tunneling current and for the noise .",
    "tunneling of an electron from the stm tip is followed by propagation of the collective excitations of the luttinger liquid towards both ends of the nanotube . @xmath58 where the contribution to the noise coming from @xmath59 has been dropped because it contributes to order @xmath39 . expressing the hamiltonian in terms of the fields , the limit @xmath60=\\partial_x \\phi_{c+}$ ]",
    "is used in order to cast the time ordered averages into correlators of exponentials only : @xmath61 where the contribution from the stm tip is the same as before .",
    "the two time ordered products ( one for the tip and one for the nanotube ) are expressed in terms of luttinger liquid green s functions .",
    "taking the spatial derivative , one obtains an expression with green s functions as prefactors  implying propagation  as well as exponentiated green s functions at the tunneling location . operating variable changes in the integrals and noticing that only @xmath62 contributes , the current and noise",
    "become : @xmath63 note the temporal decoupling ( which occurs after operating variable changes ) in these expressions .",
    "the integral over @xmath64 contains information on electron tunneling at @xmath24 , while the remaining integrals involve propagation , thus the spatial dependence in the green s functions arguments .",
    "in the previous section , general expressions were derived for the current and noise , which are independent of the form of the green s functions @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the green s functions are described in appendix a and are used to compute the tunneling noise and current as well as the nanotube noise and current .",
    "after substitution of the green s function of a nanotube , the tunneling current and noise read :    @xmath68    with the exponent : @xmath69 @xmath70 is the bulk tunneling exponent of the current  voltage characteristics @xmath71 the integrals are computed in appendix b , we obtain : @xmath72 where we used the definition of the gamma function @xmath73 . only electrons can tunnel from the tip to the nanotube , so one can check that the classical schottky formula holds always : @xmath74      some of the time integrals in eq .",
    "( 22 ) has already been encountered when computing the tunneling current and noise .",
    "the current and noise thus become : @xmath75\\nonumber\\\\ & & = -\\frac{2e^2v^2_f\\gamma^2}{\\pi a}\\left(\\sum_{\\sigma}\\frac{1}{u_f^{\\sigma}}\\right ) \\left(\\frac{a}{v_f}\\right)^{\\nu}\\frac{|\\omega_0|^{\\nu}}{{\\bf \\gamma}(\\nu+1)}(i^{\\phi\\phi}(x , x')+i^{\\phi\\theta}(x , x'))~ , \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last factors are computed in appendix b. the standard assumptions of the calculation of the tunneling current and noise are recalled , as the same expressions appear in both results .",
    "we obtain : @xmath76    current conservation @xmath77 discussion ----------      one accepted diagnosis to detect effective or anomalous charges is to compare the noise with the associated current with the schottky formula in mind .",
    "a striking result is that despite the fact that electrons are tunneling from the stm tip to the bulk of the nanotube , the zero frequency current fluctuations are proportional to the current for @xmath78 : @xmath79 with an anomalous effective charge for an infinite nanotube .",
    "more can be learned from a measurement of the noise correlations .",
    "noise correlations have been proposed to detect statistical correlations in quantum transport @xcite .",
    "indeed , our geometry can be considered as a hanbury - brown and twiss correlation device .",
    "such experiments have now been completed for photons and more recently for electrons in quantum waveguides . here",
    "the novelty is that electronic excitations do not represent the right eigenmodes of the nanotube .",
    "for @xmath80 the noise correlations read : @xmath81 this is a priori negative .",
    "however , if the current direction is chosen to be positive from the tip to the extremities of the nanotube , the sign of the cross  correlations is positive .",
    "recall that the fermionic version of the hanbury - brown and twiss experiment yields negative noise correlations @xcite .",
    "so far , positive noise correlations have been attributed in priority to bosonic systems @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , there are at least two other situations where they are encountered .",
    "first , when the source of particle is a superconductor , noise correlations can also be positive depending on the junction configuration@xcite .",
    "second , they also occur in systems with floating voltage probes @xcite . in the case of a superconductor",
    ", the emission of electron pairs through separate quantum dots guarantee that the noise correlations are always positive : a ( singlet ) entangled electron pair is generated outside the superconductor @xcite .    note that the prefactors in eq .",
    "( [ positive_noise_correlations ] ) can readily be interpreted using the language of ref .",
    "@xcite . a tunneling event to the bulk of a nanotube",
    "is accompanied by the propagation of two counter - propagating charges @xmath82 .",

    "each charge is as likely to go right or left . according to ref .",

    "@xmath86~,\\ ] ] with integers @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "in particular , the addition of an electron with spin @xmath1 corresponds to the choice @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the current noise and noise correlations can be interpreted as an average over the two types of excitations : @xmath91    8 cm    a drawing where the two types of charges `` flow away '' from the tip while propagating along the nanotube is depicted in the lower part of fig .",
    "both charges @xmath84 are equally likely to go right or left , and they are emitted as a pair with opposite labels .",
    "the noise correlations of eq.([correlations_quasiparticle ] ) are rendered positive if one adopts the standard convention for measuring the current in multi - terminal conductors @xcite . here",
    "these `` positive '' noise correlations resulting from charges moving toward both extremities of the nanotube have the added particularity that they occur to second order in a perturbative tunneling calculation . in superconducting - normal systems",
    ", the two electrons which emanate from the same cooper pair and which propagate in the two luttinger liquids provide a manifestation of the non local character of quantum mechanics . in the present case ,",
    "only one electron is injected , but it is split into left and right excitations , unless one imposes one dimensional fermi liquid leads . here , we are dealing with entanglement between collective excitations of the luttinger liquid .",

    "consequently , quantum mechanical non - locality is quite explicit here .",
    "the detection of a charge @xmath84 in one arm is necessarily accompanied by the simultaneous detection of a charge @xmath99 in the other extremity of the nanotube .",
    "this entanglement is the direct consequence of the correlated state of the luttinger liquid .",
    "when additional electrons are injected , these break up into the specific modes which can propagate in either direction in the nanotube .",
    "it therefore differs significantly from its analogs which use superconductors as electron injectors , where two electrons from the same cooper pair are dissociated .",
    "when considering only one sector , such as @xmath100 , it is interesting to note that the wave function has the same structure of say , a triplet spin state ( a symmetric combination of `` up '' and `` down '' states , or `` plus '' and `` minus '' charges ) for electrons , with the electrons being replaced by chiral quasiparticle operators .",
    "indeed , one has to recognize that each chiral field @xmath94 can be written as a superposition of boson operators : @xmath101 where @xmath102 creates a boson with nanotube mode @xmath3 , spin @xmath1 and momentum @xmath103 , and characterizes the collective modes of the one dimensional liquid .",
    "according to the state written in eq .",
    "( [ quasiparticle_chiral ] ) , this linear superposition of boson operators appears in an exponential .",
    "this expresses that non - local `` many ",
    "boson '' correlations are created when an electron is injected in a nanotube , and these many - body states are entangled in the present geometry .",
    "effects similar to the detection of effective charges show up in the spin sector when time reversal symmetry ( @xmath104 ) does not hold .",
    "the spin current and spin noise are obtained in a similar manner : @xmath105 so that at large distances : @xmath106 in practice , when time reversal symmetry holds ( @xmath107 ) , spin noise correlations vanish to order @xmath38 independently from the presence or the nature of the leads . in the case where the tip is non magnetized ,",
    "the spin current and spin noise correlations also vanish .      in the presence of one - dimensional fermi",
    "liquid leads , where the leads are considered to be luttinger liquids whose interaction parameters are set to @xmath108 , quasiparticles suffer andreev type reflections @xcite at both exterminites of the nanotubes .",
    "multiple reflections of quasiparticles in the fabry - perot geometry ",
    "fermi liquid / nanotube / fermi liquid  are expected to lead to a concellation of the interaction effects in the nanotube , as in the two terminal calculations of conductance and noise @xcite .",
    "although the detailed calculation is not presented here , dimensional analysis of the time integrals suggest that , the nanotube current and noise read : @xmath109 for @xmath110 , this whould give the classical schottky formula , in the very same spirit as in ref .",
    "for @xmath111 and @xmath112 on opposite ends of the nanotube , this noise correlator should vanish , to this order : the scattering theory result has a lowest non vanishing contribution of order @xmath39 .",
    "this low voltage result is modified by a higher power law behavior at higher voltage , with a threshold voltage specified by the size of the system @xmath113 as in ref .",
    "in summary , a diagnosis for detecting the chiral excitations of a luttinger liquid nanotube has been presented , which is based on the knowledge of low frequency current fluctuation spectrum in the nanotube .",
    "typical transport calculations either address the propagation in a nanotube , or compute tunneling i(v ) characteristics . here , both are addressed because they constitute the key for obtaining the quasiparticle charges .",
    "both the noise ( autocorrelation ) and the noise correlations ( cross - correlations ) are needed to identify the charges @xmath114 .",
    "independently , note that this measurement could also be confronted to other diagnoses of the nanotube interaction parameter using tunneling current voltage characteristics .",
    "this result relies on the assumption that one dimensional fermi liquid leads are avoided .",
    "such leads have been treated in different approaches @xcite , and are also labelled radiative contacts .",
    "radiative contacts imply equilibration with the electrons . in ref .",
    "@xcite , both radiative contacts and equilibration with dressed eigenmodes were studied , with the obvious result that luttinger liquid renormalization shows up in the conductance in the latter case . in special circumstances such as the case of ref .",
    "@xcite the nanotube is embedded in the metallic contacts , and it is suspended by its ends . here , the absence of a screening gate is explicit .",
    "electron transport between these two entities likely occurs in multiple electron scattering processes as studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in these , or other contacts fabricated by growing techniques @xcite , quantities such as current and noise may not be affected by the presence of the contacts .",
    "standard fermion results should be recovered when the system is connected on one dimensional fermi liquid leads .",
    "the auto - correlation noise in one end of the nanotube should be related to the charge current with the standard schottky formula .",
    "the noise correlation signal should also vanish as expected and the next order correction @xmath115 then needs to be computed .",
    "a crucial test of the contacts is in order .",
    "it should be possible in practical situations to analyze the type of contacts which one has between the nanotube and its connections .",
    "if the ratio of the cross - correlations to the current @xmath116 does not depend on the tunneling distance ( @xmath117 ) , both contributions are of order @xmath38 and this constitutes an indication that the contacts do not affect this quasiparticle entanglement . if we are dealing with a fermi liquid behavior , the noise correlation ",
    "current ratio should behave like @xmath38 , rather than a constant .",
    "finally , we have remarked that the many - body wave function which describes a luttinger liquid with an added electron has necessarily epr @xcite entangled degrees of freedom .",
    "both electrons chiralities contribute to the emission of quasiparticle pairs moving in opposite direction .",
    "this entanglement involves many particle states , unlike its electron counterpart . a suggestion for detection of such luttinger liquid entanglement without perturbing the system with leads",
    "is nevertheless needed .",
    "the issue  how to detect this many - body entanglement  should be addressed while taking into account different models for the leads , possibly involving multiple reflections within one contact @xcite .",
    "multiple reflections of the quasiparticles from one contact to the other kill this entanglement in one dimensional fermi liquid leads , which is implicit in the vanishing of the noise correlations to this order . at any rate , this is the first time that collective excitations entanglement is discussed in a condensed matter setting .",

    "<S> transport through a metallic carbon nanotube is considered , where electrons are injected in the bulk by a scanning tunneling microscope tip . </S>",
    "<S> the charge current and noise are computed both in the absence and in the presence of one dimensional fermi liquid leads . for an infinite homogeneous nanotube , </S>",
    "<S> the shot noise exhibits effective charges different from the electron charge . </S>",
    "<S> noise correlations between both ends of the nanotube are positive , and occur to second order only in the tunneling amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> the positive correlations are symptomatic of an entanglement phenomenon between quasiparticles moving right and left from the tip . </S>",
    "<S> this entanglement involves many body states of the boson operators which describe the collective excitations of the luttinger liquid . </S>"
