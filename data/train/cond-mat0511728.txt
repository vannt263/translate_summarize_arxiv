    "the cluster variation method ( cvm ) is an approximate method of equilibrium statistical physics introduced by kikuchi @xcite as a generalization of the bethe  peierls @xcite and kramers ",
    "wannier @xcite approximations . in its modern formulation",
    "@xcite it is based on the minimization of an approximate variational free energy which is derived from the exact one by a truncation of the cumulant expansion of the entropy .",
    "this free energy depends on the probability distributions of local clusters .",
    "an account of the cvm and its applications up to the beginning of the 90s can be found in @xcite .",
    "a review article is also in preparation by the present author @xcite .    recently",
    "the relationship between the bethe ",
    "peierls approximation , that is the lowest order cvm approximation , and the belief propagation method @xcite , widely used for inference and optimization problems defined in terms of probabilistic graphical models , has been discovered @xcite , and this has led to the development of the so  called generalized belief propagation ( gbp ) @xcite , an iterative message  passing algorithm whose fixed points are stationary points of the cvm free energy",
    ".    there are only a few cases in which the cvm , and hence the gbp algorithm , gives exact results . in most cases",
    "the exactness is due to the tree  like topological structure of the underlying lattice or graph .",
    "leaving apart tree  like structures , the only case for which i am aware of the exactness of the cvm is that of disorder varieties @xcite , which occur in two  dimensional ising models with short  range competitive interactions on ordinary translation ",
    "invariant lattices , where the correlations have a particularly simple form which resembles that of one  dimensional models .    in all the cases in which the cvm is exact , independent of the reason , the equilibrium probability distribution factors into a product of local cluster probabilities , each raised to a suitable integer exponent .",
    "given the limited number of cases in which the cvm gives an exact solution , it is particularly relevant to show that for a particular protein folding model the cvm is exact and the equilibrium probability factors .",
    "this is the purpose of the present paper .",
    "the model i am going to study has been introduced and exactly solved for the first time in 1978 by wako and sait @xcite , who showed its potential application to the protein folding problem . much later ,",
    "muoz and eaton @xcite reconsidered this model , in a slightly different formulation , solved it within the so - called single ( double , triple ) sequence approximation , and made comparisons with their own experimental data , after which the model became rather popular ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "flammini , banavar and maritan @xcite derived a mean  field theory , made monte carlo simulations and solved exactly the @xmath0helix case and later bruscolini and i @xcite solved exactly the general case , using ideas that are essentially the same as those by wako and sait @xcite . the same model and techniques",
    "have recently been used for strained epitaxy on a modulated substrate @xcite .    in all these papers",
    "no reference was ever made to the original works by wako and sait .",
    "as far as i know , the first paper citing both wako  sait and muoz  eaton is due to itoh and sasai @xcite , which refer to the model as the wako  sait  muoz ",
    "eaton ( wsme ) model , as i ll do in the following .",
    "the wsme model is a one  dimensional effective model , where a given protein is regarded as a sequence of monomers ( residues ) connected by peptidic bonds , and a binary variable is associated to each peptidic bond , with the value 1 representing the folded ( or native ) configuration and the value 0 representing the unfolded configuration .",
    "an entropic cost is associated to the folded configuration .",
    "only native interactions are considered , like in g @xcite models , that is two residues are allowed to interact only if they are in contact in the native state .",
    "moreover , and this is the main characteristic of the present model , two residues can interact only if all the peptidic bonds between them in the sequence are in the native state , which gives rise to the many ",
    "body , long  range interactions .    the exact solution of the equilibrium thermodynamics of the model can be obtained through a mapping to a two  dimensional model @xcite , defined on a triangular  shaped portion of the square lattice , with local constraints as the only interactions .",
    "the dimension of the state space of a row of this model is at most equal to the length of the protein and this makes the transfer matrix approach feasible .    in the present paper",
    "i show that the equilibrium probability distribution of this model in its two  dimensional version can be written in a factorized form which is typical of generalized mean  field theories .",
    "it is a product of local cluster probabilities , marginals of the global probability . in this product",
    "only single ",
    "site , nearest  neighbour ( nn ) and square plaquette clusters appear , and the corresponding probabilities are raised to exponents which are the coefficients of the entropy expansion which appears in the formulation of the cvm @xcite . as a consequence , the cvm turns out to be exact ( which was already noticed empirically in @xcite ) , providing an exact variational free energy depending on a number of variables which scales only quadratically with the length of the protein .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in the model is described in detail , its mapping to a two  dimensional model is discussed in , then the factorization of the probability distribution is shown in .",
    "the cvm is described in , where its exactness for the present model is shown and the consequences of this property are discussed .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in .",
    "the wsme model , if considered as a model for protein folding , is a simplified effective model in the sense that one considers a very restricted state space , and imagines to integrate with respect to all the degrees of freedom except the binary peptidic bond variables , obtaining a hamiltonian which is actually an effective free energy .    in order to describe the model , consider a protein of length @xmath1 residues , and associate a binary variable @xmath2 , @xmath3 to each peptidic bond between residues @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 denotes a peptidic bond in a native configuration , @xmath7 a peptidic bond in an unfolded one .",
    "since there are actually many more unfolded configurations than native ones , an entropic cost @xmath8 is associated to each residue .",
    "two residues are allowed to interact only if they are in contact in the native state .",
    "a detailed definition of contact between residues is not needed here and can be found in @xcite . here",
    "i simply assume that a contact matrix @xmath9 is given , with elements @xmath10 if residues @xmath4 and @xmath11 ( or , equivalently , peptidic bonds @xmath4 and @xmath12 ) are in contact in the native state , and 0 otherwise .    as a further condition , residues @xmath4 and @xmath11 interact ( with an energy @xmath13 ) only if all the peptidic bonds between them are in the native state , that is only if @xmath14 .",
    "we can therefore write the hamiltonian ( effective free energy ) @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the temperature .    the remainder of this paper does not focus on the applications to the protein folding problem , but rather on the mathematical properties of the statistical mechanics of the model itself , therefore from now on we shall deal with a generic hamiltonian of the form @xmath17 where the @xmath18 s can be temperature dependent .",
    "the above hamiltonian suggests to introduce the new binary variables @xcite @xmath19 ( notice the order of the indices ) , which take value 1 if @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and 0 otherwise .",
    "these new variables can be associated to the triangular  shaped portion of the square lattice defined by @xmath22 and shown in , and the original variables are included in this set , since @xmath23 .    a typical configuration of the wsme model . an empty ( resp",
    ".  filled ) circle at row @xmath12 , column @xmath4 represents the variable @xmath24 taking value 0 ( resp .",
    "the hamiltonian can now be written as @xmath25 but the new variables are not all independent . since we have a model with @xmath26 configurations written in terms of @xmath27 binary variables , constraints must exist between these variables .",
    "these constraints can be written in different ways , and we chose @xcite to write them as @xmath28    one is therefore left with a model with a local ( actually non  interacting ) hamiltonian , and local constraints in place of the interactions .",
    "formally one could also include the constraints into the hamiltonian , by studying the limit @xmath29 of @xmath30    in the new representation the feasibility of the transfer matrix approach becomes evident .",
    "consider the variables in row @xmath12 in , that is @xmath31 . because of the constraints all configurations with @xmath32 and @xmath33 are forbidden , leaving as the only allowed states for @xmath34 the @xmath11 states denoted by @xmath35 and defined by @xmath36 in these states are readily depicted by placing @xmath37 0 s on the left of row @xmath12 and @xmath38 1 s on the right .",
    "a transfer matrix solution for a protein of length @xmath1 has then to deal with the product of @xmath39 matrices , the largest of which has size @xmath40 , the number of operations involved grows polynomially in @xmath41 , and the model can be easily solved even for long proteins .",
    "the existence of a row  to  row transfer matrix is intimately connected to the factorization of the model s probability distribution over rows .",
    "this is well known in statistical mechanics ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "readers interested in a purely statistical formulation will regard this as an instance of the junction tree theorem @xcite .",
    "i report here the basic steps of a proof for the present case .",
    "first of all , write the hamiltonian as a sum of row  to  row terms : @xmath42 if the hamiltonian has the form reported in , then one can write @xmath43 where , in order to take into account the boundaries , @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath46 . for simplicity of notation ,",
    "i drop from now on the arguments of @xmath47 .",
    "of course , the specific form of @xmath47 is irrelevant here , only the splitting into terms involving only adjacent rows is important .",
    "then we introduce the boltzmann distribution @xmath48 where we have absorbed @xmath49 in the definition of the hamiltonian and introduced the partition function @xmath50    finally we define the marginal probability distributions for a row @xmath51 and for a pair of adjacent rows @xmath52 the arguments of these probability will also be dropped in the following .",
    "introducing the partial partition functions for upper and lower portions of the lattice @xmath53 together with the boundary conditions @xmath54 it is easy to show that @xmath55 and hence @xmath56 this shows that the global probability can be written as a product of row  pair and row probabilities , raised to exponents 1 and -1 respectively , which is the first step towards our final result . as a consequence , a cvm with all row  pairs as maximal clusters ( see ) would be exact for this model , but this is not interesting here , since a much stronger property will be proved below .",
    "the above discussion is not specific to the present model and so far the constraints have not yet been exploited .",
    "the next step is then to make use of the constraints to write in a factor form similar to the row and row  pair probabilities .",
    "consider first the row probability .",
    "observe that , due to the constraints , @xmath57 and the probability of the state @xmath35 defined in reduces to a nn pair probability : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the nn ( horizontal ) pair probability for the pair at row @xmath12 and columns @xmath60 .",
    "indeed , @xmath35 is the only state of row @xmath12 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "in addition , for the states @xmath63 ( all 1 s ) and @xmath64 ( all 0 s ) one can write @xmath65 ( actually the probabilities for these states could be reduced to site probabilities , but this is not useful here ) .",
    "introducing the site probabilities @xmath66 and observing that @xmath67 one can write the above results for the row probability in the @xmath37independent factorized form @xmath68    a similar result can be obtained for the row  pair probability . in this case",
    "one needs to define the square probability @xmath69 , the triangle probability @xmath70 for the triangles lying on the diagonal boundary and the nn ( vertical ) pair probability @xmath71 .",
    "there are two kinds of row  pair configurations : @xmath72 which represents the cases in which peptidic bonds @xmath12 and @xmath11 are in the same native stretch ( e.g.rows 3 and 4 in ) or ( for @xmath73 ) a new native stretch starts at @xmath11 ( e.g.  rows 7 and 8 in ) , and @xmath74 which represents the cases in which a native stretch of length @xmath38 ends at @xmath12 ( e.g.  rows 5 and 6 in ) . for both kinds we have to show that a factorization like occurs .",
    "the proof parallels the one for the row probability .",
    "consider the first kind of configurations and observe that , due to the constraints , @xmath75 for the boundary cases one has @xmath76    observing that @xmath77 the row  pair probability can be written as @xmath78 where the last factor in the numerator is a triangle probability .",
    "for simplicity , the arguments of the probability have been dropped .",
    "consider now configurations of the second kind .",
    "equations ( [ rowpair1 ] ) , ( [ rowpair2 ] ) and ( [ rowpair4 ] ) are replaced by @xmath79 @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively .",
    "the factorization property @xmath82 is then proved for any valid row  pair configuration .    in order to obtain the final result of this section , plug equations ( [ factorrow ] ) and ( [ factorrowpair ] ) into , obtaining @xmath83 that is the global probability is reduced to a product of square , triangle and site probabilities divided by a product of pair probabilities .",
    "in this section , after a brief introduction to the cvm , it is shown that the factorization implies the exactness of the cvm , and the consequences of this property are discussed .",
    "the cvm in its modern formulation is derived from the variational principle of statistical mechanics , which states that , given a model with variables @xmath84 and hamiltonian @xmath85 , its equilibrium ( boltzmann ) probability distribution @xmath86 is the distribution which minimizes the variational free energy @xmath87 the physical values of the free energy @xmath88 , the energy @xmath89 and the entropy @xmath90 can then be calculated at the minimum .",
    "if the variables are associated to the nodes of a graph , or to the sites of a lattice , one can define clusters of nodes ( e.g.  single sites , pairs , triangles , square plaquettes ,  ) . for each cluster @xmath0",
    "define also the corresponding set of variables @xmath91 , probability distribution @xmath92 and entropy @xmath93    the entropy cumulants are defined by @xmath94 which can be solved with respect to the cumulants by means of a mbius inversion , which yields @xmath95 where @xmath96 denotes the number of nodes in cluster @xmath0 .",
    "the full entropy @xmath97 can then be approximated by selecting a set @xmath98 of clusters , made of certain maximal clusters and all their subclusters , and truncating the cumulant expansion by retaining only terms which correspond to clusters in @xmath98 .",
    "one obtains @xmath99 where the coefficients @xmath100 , sometimes called mbius numbers , satisfy @xcite @xmath101 the above condition , practically useful for determining the @xmath100 s , means that every subcluster must be counted exactly once in the entropy expansion .",
    "now assume that the hamiltonian is made of local terms only , and @xmath98 has been chosen such that one can write @xmath102 in such a case the variational free energy can be written , with the above approximation on the entropy and no approximation on the energy , as @xmath103 where the minimization must be performed with respect to the @xmath104 s with the constraints @xmath105    it is interesting to observe that a suitable factorization of the equilibrium probability of the model implies that the variational free energy reduces to the cvm variational free energy with no approximation .",
    "more precisely , assume that the equilibrium probability factorizes in terms of its marginals according to @xmath106^{a_\\alpha}. \\label{factorcvm}\\ ] ] then one can restrict the variational principle to distributions @xmath107 with the same property .",
    "the entropy of such a distribution is @xmath108 and the cvm free energy is therefore obtained with no approximation ( recall that no approximation was made on the energy term ) .",
    "the wsme model in its two  dimensional representation falls precisely in this case .",
    "if one chooses as maximal clusters all the square plaquettes and the triangles lying on the diagonal boundary the hamiltonian can obviously be written as in and the mbius numbers for the entropy expansion , obtained by , are :    @xmath109 : :    @xmath110 for the maximal clusters ; @xmath109 : :    @xmath111 for the triangles not lying on the diagonal    boundary and the next  nearest  neighbour pairs , since they are    contained in exactly 1 maximal cluster ; @xmath109 : :    @xmath112 for all the nn pairs contained in 2    maximal clusters , that is all nn pairs except the boundary ones ; @xmath109 : :    @xmath111 for the boundary nn pairs ; @xmath109 : :    @xmath110 for the sites contained in 4 maximal    clusters and 4 nn pairs , that is all sites except the boundary ones ; @xmath109 : :    @xmath111 for the boundary sites .    with the above mbius numbers it is immediate to check that the factorization is exactly the one that we have obtained in for the wsme model , and hence the cvm is exact for this model .",
    "the corresponding variational free energy , dropping all the arguments in the entropy term , reads @xmath113 the local constraints can be either included in the hamiltonian or imposed by hand on the probabilities .",
    "the numerical minimization of the above variational free energy can in principle be performed by a provably  convergent , double  loop algorithm like the one proposed by heskes , albers and kappen @xcite , while the gbp fails , probably due to the constraints , except in very simple cases .",
    "this is not an important point however , since the strength of this result is not that it improves on the transfer matrix method , which is already very efficient in solving for the equilibrium . on this side",
    "the only advantage of this approach is probably that in this scheme it is easier to calculate correlation functions , since the probabilities are directly accessible .",
    "the real strength of this result , apart from having found a new model which is exactly solvable by the cvm , is that here the cvm can serve as a basis to build powerful approximation for the dynamics of the model , which is extremely relevant for the protein folding problem .",
    "for this purpose , it might also be useful to observe that the variational free energy can be written explicitly in terms of the local expectations @xmath114 to this end observe that in the variational free energy the energy term is already a linear function of these expectations , while the probabilities appearing in the entropy term can be written as functions of these expectations as independent variables .",
    "for instance , using and normalization one obtains @xmath115 for the nn pair one configuration is forbidden by the constraints , and the remaining probabilities are determined by normalization and marginalization to the site probabilities , obtaining @xmath116 for the horizontal pair and @xmath117 for the vertical pair .",
    "similarly , for a triangle lying on the diagonal boundary , only 4 configurations are allowed by the constraints , and their probabilities are again determined by normalization and marginalization to subclusters , with the result @xmath118 finally , for a square plaquette we have 5 allowed configurations and the probabilities @xmath119 substituting the above probabilities into the variational free energy yields an exact variational free energy as a function of @xmath27 independent local variables .",
    "i have shown that the equilibrium probability factors into a product of local cluster probabilities , and hence the cvm is exact , for the wsme model of protein folding .",
    "after the one  dimensional wsme model , which has long  range , many  body interactions , has been mapped into a two  dimensional model which has local constraints as the only interactions , the proof goes through two steps .",
    "the first step exploits the locality of the interactions , the second one the detailed form of the constraints .",
    "the result is especially relevant on the methodological side , since leaving apart tree  like models , the cvm is exact , as far as i know , only on disorder varieties of two  dimensional models .",
    "moreover , some consequences can be expected also on the model side . as far as equilibrium properties are concerned",
    ", we have almost no improvement with respect to the transfer matrix method , which is already very fast in this matter .",
    "the main advantage of the cvm solution is that correlation functions are much easier to calculate .",
    "the most important point is however that the cvm solution for the equilibrium can be a starting point for good approximations for the dynamics , which is of utmost importance in the context of the protein folding problem .",
    "two approaches can be followed @xcite .",
    "on one hand , one can develop a master equation approach based on the approximation that the state of the system at any time can be described as an equilibrium state of the wsme model , with a time ",
    "dependent hamiltonian ( the so  called local equilibrium approximation @xcite ) . on the basis of the results reported here ,",
    "this means that the probability at any time is assumed to factorize as the equilibrium one .",
    "alternatively , one can build an approximation for the dynamics with the path probability method ( ppm , the dynamical version of the cvm ) @xcite , with square plaquettes and triangles as maximal clusters .",
    "since the stationary state of the ppm corresponds to the cvm solution for the equilibrium , one obtains an approximation for the dynamics which is guaranteed to converge to the exact equilibrium state .",
    "it can be verified @xcite that the two approaches are equivalent in the limit of vanishing time step and that very good agreement is obtained with respect to the exact solution for short chains .",
