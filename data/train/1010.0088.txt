    "the hygro - thermal behavior of concrete plays a crucial role in the assessment of the reliability and lifetime of concrete structures .",
    "the heat and mass transfer processes become particularly important at high temperatures , where the increased pressure in pores may lead to catastrophic service failures . since",
    "high - temperature experiments are very expensive , predictive modeling of humidity migration and pore pressure developments can result in significant economic savings .",
    "the first mathematical models of concrete exposed to temperatures exceeding @xmath0c were formulated by baant and  thonguthai in @xcite . since then , a considerable effort has been invested into detailed numerical simulations of concrete structures subject to high temperatures . however , much less attention has been given to the qualitative properties of the model , as well as of the related numerical methods .",
    "in particular , the only related work the authors are aware of is due to dalk _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who analyzed the numerical solution of the kiessl model  @xcite for moisture and heat transfer in porous materials .",
    "they proved some existence and regularity results and suggested an efficient numerical approach to the solution of the resulting system of highly non - liner equations .",
    "however , the kiessl model is valid for limited temperature range only and as such it is inappropriate for high - temperature applications . in this contribution",
    ", we extend the work  @xcite by proving the existence and uniqueness of an approximate solution for the baant - thonguthai model , arising from the semi - implicit discretization in time . a fully discrete algorithm",
    "is then obtained by standard finite element discretization and its performance is illustrated for a model problem of a concrete segment exposed to transient heating according to the standard iso fire curve . here , the focus is on the short - term pore pressure build up , which is decisive for the assessment of so - called thermal spalling during fire .    at this point",
    ", it is fair to mention that the baant - thonguthai model was later extended towards more detailed multi - phase description , see e.g. the works of gawin _ et al . _",

    "when compared to the original version , these advanced models provide better insight into physical and chemical processes in concrete ( such as influence of gel water , pore water , capillary water , chemical reactions at elevated temperatures , etc . ) . such potential increase in accuracy",
    ", however , comes at the expense of increased number of parameters , which typically reflect complex multi - scale nature of concrete .",
    "hence , their experimental determination is rather complicated and the parameters can often only be calibrated by sub - scale simulations .",
    "therefore , in this work we adopt a pragmatic approach and consider the single - phase baant - thonguthai model with parameters provided by heuristic relations , obtained from regression of reliable macroscopic experiments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ] , we present the general single - phase , purely macroscopic , model for prediction of hygro - thermal behavior of heated concrete . in section",
    "[ notation ] , we introduce basic notation , the appropriate function spaces and formulate the problem in the strong and variational sense . in section  [ assumptions ] , we specify our assumptions on data and modify structure conditions to obtain a reasonably simple but still realistic model of hygro - thermal behavior of concrete at high temperatures due to baant and  thonguthai  @xcite .",
    "an application of the rothe method of discretization in time leads to a coupled system of semilinear steady - state equations , which ( together with the appropriate boundary conditions ) form a semilinear elliptic boundary value problem , formulated in the form of operator equation in appropriate function spaces .",
    "the existence result for this problem in space @xmath1 with @xmath2 is proven in section  [ existence_discrete ] using the general theory of coercive and pseudomonotone operators in banach spaces .",

    "[ example ] , numerical experiments are performed to investigate the moisture migration , temperature distribution and pore pressure build up in the model of concrete specimen exposed to fire , including a simple engineering approach to study the spalling phenomenon .",

    "<S> is established using the theory of pseudomonotone operators in banach spaces . </S>",
    "<S> next , the spatial discretization is accomplished by the conforming finite element method . </S>",
    "<S> an illustrative numerical example shows that the model reproduces well the rapid increase of pore pressure in wet concrete due to extreme heating . </S>",
