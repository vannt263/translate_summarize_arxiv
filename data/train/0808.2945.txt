    "the use of gaussian random functions to describe the spatial structure of complex physical systems has had a wide range of success , originating with rice s description of the random currents of shot noise @xcite and longuet - higgins description of random water waves @xcite , more recently in such diverse fields as sound waves and acoustics @xcite , turbulence @xcite , optical speckle patterns @xcite , and the cosmic microwave background fluctuations @xcite .    in the realm of quantum wave physics ,",
    "the same universality of the amplitude fluctuations has been conjectured in the spatial patterns of eigenfunctions in systems with classical ( ray ) chaotic dynamics @xcite .",
    "the analogy between the equations of a non - interacting two - dimensional electron gas and the electromagnetic modes of a microwave cavity @xcite ( see refs .   for reviews ) allows a unified treatment in the language of quantum billiards , namely as solutions of the two - dimensional helmholtz equation @xmath0 with wavenumber @xmath1 energy @xmath2 where @xmath3 we therefore may study the properties of electron wavefunctions , which are difficult to access experimentally , by means of measurements using our microwave experimental setup .",
    "previously , insights from this analogy have had a strong impact on the theoretical study of coherent effects on electronic systems in the mesoscopic regime , where the spatial correlations of the electronic wavefunction are , besides the fluctuations of the energy spectra , the source of mesoscopic reproducible fluctuations ( see refs .   for recent examples ) .",
    "concerning fundamental questions , the measurements of complicated statistical measures ( namely , averages over the experimentally constructed eigenfunctions of complicated functionals ) are very stringent probes for the statistical assumptions upon which theoretical models of chaotic wavefunctions are based .",
    "the primary such model is the so - called random wave model ( rwm ) , proposed by berry @xcite , based on the isotropic 2-dimensional random waves studied by longuet - higgins @xcite .",
    "the basic rwm is a statistically stationary isotropic solution of the two - dimensional helmholtz equation ( time - independent schrdinger equation ) , statistically invariant to translation and rotation .",
    "the rwm predicts that the spatial fluctuations of eigenfuctions are gaussian distributed , and this gives rise to characteristic morphological features ( e.g.  refs .  ) .",
    "so far , and largely due to the experimental possibility given by the microwave measurements , the assumption of gaussian statistics has successfully passed very demanding tests . to mention just two examples where very complicated functionals of the measured eigenfunctions are required and the rwm provide excellent results we have the distribution of current @xcite , the intensity distribution in the transition from closed to open billiards @xcite and the distribution of quantum stress tensor @xcite ( see ref .   for a recent review ) .    in this paper",
    "we address a different type of functional , based on the nodal properties of complex chaotic wavefunctions , and show again how the assumption of gaussian statistics is strongly supported by the experimental results .",
    "the features of the random eigenfunctions we study here are the critical points of the current density ( hereafter current ) associated with the complex wave @xmath4 the current density is defined by @xmath5 in quantum - mechanical systems @xmath6 is representing the probability current density at position @xmath7 .",
    "in quasi - two - dimensional electromagnetic microwave billiards there is a one - to - one correspondence of @xmath6 to the poynting vector @xcite .    since @xmath8 is assumed to satisfy the two - dimensional helmholtz equation , the points where @xmath9 are of two types : vortices of the flow ( also known as circulations , wave dislocations , nodal points and phase singularities @xcite ) , where @xmath10 and about which the current swirls in a counterclockwise ( @xmath11 ) or clockwise ( @xmath12 ) sense , and saddle points ( stagnation points ) , which are also saddle points of the phase @xmath13 and hyperbolic points in the current flow .",
    "( the existence of phase extrema  maxima or minima  is prohibited by the helmholtz equation @xcite . )",
    "the topological poincar index of these types of points , describing the number of turns of @xmath14 in a small circuit of the critical point , is @xmath15 for vortices ( regardless of the sense of circulation ) , and @xmath16 for saddle points .",
    "general arguments based on statistical isotropy demonstrate that there can be no net accumulation of topological charge , either in the sign of the vortices , or in the poincar index .",
    "therefore , the densities of positive and negative vortices must be equal , and the bulk vortex density must equal the bulk saddle density ; calculations based on the rwm @xcite give this vortex density as @xmath17 knowledge of the positions of the critical points of the current vector field provides a skeleton on which the rest of the flow field is based .",
    "an important deviation to the bulk rwm is caused by the presence of boundaries .",
    "the interplay between spatial confinement and gaussian fluctuations is by no means trivial , and it has even been claimed that in confined systems gaussian fluctuations are valid only over very short distances @xcite .",
    "substantial progress has been made recently in modifying the basic rwm to include boundary effects @xcite , supported by numerical evidence @xcite , and there appears to be no reason to believe that the gaussian assumption fails in the vicinity of a system s boundary . here , we present to our knowledge the first experimental measurements demonstrating the validity of boundary - adapted rwms , based on dirichlet conditions on an infinite straight wall .",

    "although some of the theoretical predictions we compare with have been derived before ( such as the vortex - vortex correlation functions @xcite and vortex density fluctuations against a straight wall @xcite ) , others are new . in particular , we derive the density fluctuations of saddle points in the presence of an infinite straight boundary on which the wave satisfies mixed ( robin ) boundary conditions , and , although we were unable to derive exact saddle correlation functions analytically , we have found large-@xmath20 asymptotic approximations to these functions .",

    "the fixed antenna had a metallic core of diameter 1 mm and a teflon coating while the probe antenna @xmath23 was a thin wire of diameter 0.2 mm to minimize the leakage current .",
    "the lengths of the antenna @xmath23 and antenna @xmath25 were 4 and 5 mm respectively .    for microwave frequencies @xmath26ghz , where @xmath27 is the velocity of light and @xmath28 is the resonator height ,",

    "additionally a zoom of the flow pattern is shown to visualize the structure and showing the different types of critical points in the flow .",
    "we previously have reported results on vortex pair correlation functions and nearest neighbor distance distributions [ ] for vortex points . through improvements in data analysis",
    ", we have been able to study the saddle points of the current in addition to the vortices , and significantly reduce the effects of noise in our measured correlation functions .",
    "these improvements are sketched in the following .",
    "we have increased the spatial resolution by a factor of two compared to our previous measurements before and we now use additionally a bilinear interpolation method for the individual components of the flow . using the bilinear interpolation we estimate the nodal lines of the individual flow components , enabling us to get the exact position for vortex and saddle points within this approximation .",
    "the extraction of critical point locations is now fully automatic , allowing large samples of data to be analyzed .",
    "one can see the effect of these improvements in the better results for the pair correlation functions ( good agreements also for small @xmath30 ) and the charge correlation function which we can present here for the first time .",

    "the number and location of critical points for a given field must be founded by explicitly solving the set of equations @xmath50 .",
    "this of course requires the precise knowledge of the spatial dependence of the particular solution @xmath51 in which we are interested .",
    "the task of solving the helmholtz equation in cases where the geometry of the confinement ( transversal section of the waveguide ) is such that eq .",
    "( [ eq : helm ] ) is not separable is usually very demanding .",
    "this makes the function - by - function study of current morphology almost impossible .    a suitable way to overcome",

    "this idea is based on the strong uniformity of the solutions of the helmholtz equation with non - integrable geometries ( see for example fig .",
    "[ fig::data ] ) , indicating that their main properties actually depend on far fewer parameters than the full solution itself .",
    "we therefore consider , instead of a given set of solutions of the helmholtz equation , an _ ensemble _ of fields .",
    "this ensemble will be constructed in such a way that the most general and basic properties of the exact solutions are respected , in the hope that these general properties suffice to fix the morphology fluctuations .",
