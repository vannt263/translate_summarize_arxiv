    "towards galactic longitude @xmath3 , there are three extended , shell - type supernova remnants within an area of a few degrees ; g114.3 + 0.3 , g116.5 + 1.1 , and g116.9 + 0.2 also known as ctb  1 .",
    "the proximity of these sources and their relative sizes suggest a possible association .",
    "kinematic distance estimates which are based on the correlation with surrounding atomic material are very difficult due to poor resolution of available data .",
    "absorption measurements fail because the sources are not bright enough to be absorbed by the warm foreground gas and possibly related co was not detected . as a result distances to these remnants are poorly determined , especially for ctb  1 , where the suggested values differ by more than a factor of two . in an attempt to improve the distance estimates of these remnants and to learn more about their environment we analyzed new observations from the cgps @xcite , which provides data at an unprecedented resolution of about 1 .    in this paper",
    ", we also present new radio continuum and polarization images of the region at 1420 mhz , from the cgps database . a multi - frequency study of these remnants , especially of ctb  1 , at 408 , 2700 , 4850 and 10500 mhz , including a comparative polarization analysis will be the topic of another publication ( yar - uyaniker et al .",
    "2003 , in preparation ) .",
    "in what follows we will review the characteristics of each individual source .",
    "g114.3@xmath00.3 was identified as a supernova remnant by @xcite based on a comparison of radio continuum data at 11  cm and 21  cm .",
    "they suggested a distance of 3.4  kpc based on possibly related at a systemic velocity between @xmath135  km / s and @xmath145  km / s . @xcite and",
    "@xcite associated this remnant with the pulsar psr  2334 + 61 .",
    "the distance of the pulsar was obtained from its dispersion measure of @xmath4 pc @xmath5  now a more accurate value is available which gives dm@xmath6 @xcite  as 2.4(2.5 )  kpc , using the model of free electrons by @xcite .",
    "the newly calculated model for the galactic distribution of free electrons by @xcite is unfortunately not very useful for us since the authors incorporated a void in the direction of g114.3@xmath00.3 most likely to accommodate for the larger distance to the snr predicted by previous authors .",
    "as already discussed by @xcite , the rotation measure ( rm ) and dispersion measure of pulsars increase anomalously in the presence of small scale regions along the line of sight .",
    "they found that psr 2334 + 61 has an anomalous rm behaviour and the calculated foreground magnetic field along the line of sight is more than twice that of pulsars which are supposed to have no foreground object affecting their dm and rm values .",
    "thus , the distance determination from the dm or rm of the pulsar may not be very accurate .",
    "g114.3 + 0.3 has also been detected in optical emission @xcite .",
    "given the fact that optical emission suffers strongly from interstellar absorption the existence of optical emission from this snr points to a rather close distance .",
    "g116.5 + 1.1 was also discovered and identified by @xcite at 21  cm and 11  cm wavelengths . using low resolution data , from the maryland - green bank survey @xcite",
    ", @xcite noted a depression in between @xmath7 km s@xmath2 and @xmath8 km s@xmath2 , which they translated to a distance between 3.6  kpc and 5.2  kpc .",
    "they did not notice any other feature in their data which might be associated with this snr .",
    "@xcite have detected faint optical filaments in h@xmath9 and .",
    "the most prominent one , about @xmath10 long , positionally coincides with the bright radio rim .",
    "ctb  1 has been extensively studied in radio @xcite and in optical emission @xcite .",
    "h@xmath9 observations give a mean optical velocity of @xmath11 km s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a systemic velocity of @xmath135 km s@xmath2 to @xmath12 km s@xmath2 , by relating the snr to an structure partially encompassing the remnant from the south .",
    "however the resolution of their data ( @xmath13 ) does not allow a conclusive agreement between the remnant s shell and the filaments .",
    "they also mention the existence of an expanding atomic hydrogen shell associated with ctb  1 , whose parts can be traced in the red and blue shifted components at velocities @xmath14 km s@xmath2 to @xmath15 km s@xmath2 and @xmath16 km s@xmath2 . however , the full extent of this shell , expanding with a velocity of 20  km  s@xmath2 to 40  km  s@xmath2 , remained undetermined due to the confusion with the local and outer arm emission .",
    "@xcite used data at 5@xmath17 angular resolution , achieving a velocity resolution of @xmath18 km s@xmath2 .",
    "three major components in their spectra are evident , signaling the local arm gas at @xmath120 to @xmath020 km s@xmath2 , the perseus arm gas at @xmath130 to @xmath170 km s@xmath2 and the outer arm gas at @xmath190 to @xmath1110 km s@xmath2 .",
    "they did not find an exact correlation at any velocity .",
    "however , they found an area of emission between @xmath115 km s@xmath2 and @xmath135 km s@xmath2 which peaks at @xmath15 km s@xmath2 and associated the remnant with this area .",
    "this velocity is also comparable to that obtained from the h@xmath9 data and implies a distance of 2.8  kpc using a flat rotation curve with @xmath19 kpc and @xmath20 km s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "absorption measurements towards the western rim of ctb  1 provided no distance , because the foreground brightness ( @xmath21 k t@xmath22 ) is too high in comparison to the continuum emission ( @xmath23 k t@xmath24 with respect to the background ) . by comparing nearby open clusters , o associations , and regions @xcite have concluded that ctb  1 must have a distance of @xmath25 kpc .",
    "this would place the snr in the interarm region between local arm and perseus arm .    according to @xcite",
    "all three snrs belong to a group of objects located within a large shell at a velocity of @xmath26 km s@xmath2 , which translates to a distance of 4.2 kpc using a flat rotation curve .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , quote the corresponding distance as 3.4 kpc , by comparing the velocity of the center of the perseus arm with the distances of the regions in the neighboring area .    as demonstrated above",
    ", determining the distance of a supernova remnant is a difficult task .",
    "the established distances to many remnants are based on a relation between the surface brightness of the snr to its diameter , usually called the @xmath27 relation . since it has been shown that such a relation does not exist or just gives upper distance limits ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a thorough discussion ) , we ignore previous distance estimates of these snrs from the @xmath27 relations and concentrate on more direct observational evidence to determine distances ; such as morphological and circumstantial coincidence of continuum and data , absorption features and relation of snrs with the surrounding astronomical objects with known distances .",
    "radio continuum and line observations at 1420 mhz were carried out simultaneously with the synthesis telescope of the dominion radio astrophysical observatory ( drao ) @xcite as part of the cgps .",
    "the angular resolution of the final data products at this frequency is @xmath28 for the radio continuum and @xmath29 for the data .",
    "the data have a velocity resolution of 1.3 km s@xmath2 covering 256 channels from @xmath1158 km s@xmath2 to @xmath052 km s@xmath2 with a channel separation of 0.82  km s@xmath2 .",
    "the rms noise in the images at full resolution is 0.03 k t@xmath22 in continuum and 3 k t@xmath22 in .",
    "a detailed description of the data processing routines can be found in @xcite . except the polarization maps ,",
    "single antenna data are incorporated into the synthesis maps to ensure accurate representation of all structures up to the largest scales .",
    "the low spatial frequency data are from the low resolution drao survey of the cgps region observed with the drao 26-m telescope @xcite .",
    "in this section we briefly describe the structure of the radio continuum emission in the area around the three snrs .",
    "all of the snrs display partial shell structures placed on top of smooth emission plateaus .",
    "[ c21 ] displays a large region of approximately @xmath30 in size , which includes all of the snrs discussed in this paper and shows their relative positions to each other .",
    "the contour map representations of these remnants , shown in fig .  [ con2 ] and [ con1 ] , provide details about the surrounding emission plateaus .    ctb  1 , at lower latitude in fig .  [ con1 ] , is the smallest with an angular diameter of @xmath31 and has the highest surface brightness .",
    "its emission is concentrated in two bright arcs in the south - east and in the west ; and these two arcs , apart from a region with less emission ( the breakout region ) towards north - east , form an almost circular shape .",
    "g114.3 + 0.3 ( fig .  [ con2 ] ) shows a dominant thin arc in the south - west . within its boundary",
    "is the bright region s  165 , which is not related to the supernova remnant @xcite .",
    "the angular size of this snr is @xmath32 .",
    "the associated pulsar psr 2334 + 61 is located at the center of the remnant @xcite .",
    "g116.5 + 1.1 ( fig .",
    "[ con1 ] ) is located just north of ctb  1 , and has an angular size of @xmath33 . the strongest emission from the remnant",
    "is concentrated in a relatively thick arc , @xmath34 wide , at the opposite side of ctb  1 .",
    "a smooth emission plateau with a brightness of 0.5 k t@xmath22 , which is encircling the two snrs , is placed on top of the smooth galactic background component of about @xmath35 k t@xmath22 , in this direction .",
    "this emission plateau might indicate a possible association .",
    "polarization properties of the drao synthesis telescope are given in @xcite and preparation of polarized survey images are discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "portions of the polarization data relevant to this paper , showing all three remnants , are plotted in fig .  [ pol ] at 2@xmath17 resolution .",
    "polarized emission above 0.1 k t@xmath22 is detected from both g114.3 and g116.5 .",
    "they appear as partial shells with fine structure in polarization .",
    "ctb  1 , on the other hand , appears to be weaker .    in the following sections we will use the polarization data as an argument to claim a close distance for the snrs . according to @xcite",
    "there exists a maximum distance from which the polarized emission reaches us without being totally depolarized .",
    "this distance depends on the electron density , the strength of the magnetic field and the distance from which the emission originates .",
    "@xcite called this distance the `` _ polarization horizon _ '' .",
    "clearly the horizon is not single valued and varies with the wavelength of the observation and physical parameters along the line of sight .",
    "this , however , implies a strong relationship between the detectability of the polarized emission and the distance of the object .",
    "a phase shift of 90@xmath36 between two polarization vectors would cause total depolarization . to achieve this phase shift a rotation measure of 36 rad m@xmath37 at 21  cm is required . towards the snrs",
    "the magnetic field strength parallel to the line of sight is b@xmath38 g @xcite .",
    "this yields a dispersion measure of 44 @xmath5 pc according to eqn .",
    "[ eqn1 ] , for which the electron density model of @xcite gives a distance of 2.2 kpc in this direction .",
    "this value is similar to the one found by @xcite towards @xmath39 and implies that rotation measure sets an upper limit on the path length of the observable polarized emission , namely the distance of the object .",
    "the 21 cm line data from the cgps reveal new information about the kinematics of the neutral hydrogen surrounding these three snrs .",
    "figures  [ h2 ] and [ h1 ] present averaged maps towards these snrs .",
    "bright and large emission patches surround g114.3 + 0.3 , centered at a velocity of @xmath40 km s@xmath41 ( see fig .  [ h2 ] ) .",
    "no other feature which shows any resemblance to the snr can be found in the entire data cube .",
    "using a flat rotation model for the milky way with @xmath19  kpc and @xmath20  km s@xmath2 this would translate to a kinematic distance of 700  pc , which is significantly closer than all previously published distance estimates all of which proposed a location within perseus arm .",
    "the structure of the emission does not indicate that the environment was shaped by the stellar wind of the progenitor star , in which case we would expect a more dynamic environment dominated by thin filaments .",
    "the environment of g116.5 + 1.1 as displayed in fig .",
    "[ h1 ] ( left panel ) looks like it was carved out by the expanding shockwave of the supernova explosion . to the west and south",
    "there are bright patches of following nicely the curvature of the radio bright shell . to the east",
    "most of the area shows a lack of . like for g114.3 + 0.3",
    "it looks like the ambient medium was not influenced by stellar wind effects of the progenitor star .",
    "the central radial velocity of the structure is about @xmath42  km s@xmath2 which translates to a kinematic distance of about 1.6  kpc .",
    "ctb  1 , on the other hand , is surrounded by an `` open - end - ring '' of neutral hydrogen ( see fig .",
    "[ h1 ] , right panel ) centered at @xmath43 km s@xmath2 , which translates to a kinematic distance of 2.5 kpc .",
    "the shape of the surrounding ring coincides well with the breakout appearance of the snr s radio continuum emission as seen in fig .",
    "[ con1 ] . in this case",
    "the structure of the surrounding looks more dynamic . here",
    "we find thin filaments and shells indicating a highly dynamic environment in contrast to the smooth bright patches surrounding the other snrs ( better presented in figs  [ ch1]-[ch2 ] ) .",
    "the progenitor star of ctb  1 obviously had a strong stellar wind and affected the ambient medium significantly .    in the area around ctb  1 the local arm and the perseus arm",
    "are very distinct in velocity space as clearly demonstrated in the velocity - distance diagram in fig .",
    "[ veldis ] , where we plotted snrs and regions within 20of galactic longitude of the snrs as a function of distance to emphasize this fact .",
    "local objects have radial velocities above @xmath44 km  s@xmath2 while perseus arm sources show radial velocities below @xmath15 km  s@xmath2 . the decision whether g114.3 and g116.5 reside in the local arm or the perseus arm , based on the radial velocities of @xmath45 km s@xmath2 and @xmath42 km s@xmath2 respectively ,",
    "is made very simple .",
    "however , the associated shell of ctb  1 with a radial velocity of @xmath46 km  s@xmath2 indicates an interarm location close to perseus arm . because of the complex and highly dynamic environment of the snr , which suggests a highly active progenitor star with a strong stellar wind , we believe that ctb  1 must reside in one of the spiral arms",
    "this makes ctb  1 either a blueshifted local or a slightly redshifted perseus arm object .",
    "besides the possibly related structure we found , a fact that most of the time is somewhat subjective anyway , we have many other observational and circumstantial evidence which can give us constraints on the distance of this snr .",
    "first of all , optical filaments were detected by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since optical emission suffers from interstellar absorption its presence indicates a rather low distance . in the direction of g114.3",
    "+ 0.3 this would mean that a perseus arm location is rather unlikely .",
    "this fact is supported by the presence of polarized emission in the cgps at 21  cm ( see fig .  [ pol ] ) which indicates a distance in front of the so - called polarization horizon , which was found to be at about 2  kpc for cgps data @xcite .",
    "these two constraints already imply a location in the local arm rather than the perseus arm .",
    "an additional upper limit can be derived from the distance to s  165 which is not depolarizing the 11  cm continuum emission at its line of sight and hence must be located behind the snr @xcite . a new spectroscopic distance estimate @xcite puts this region at a distance of 1.6  kpc .",
    "these additional characteristics agree with the earlier assessment that g114.3 + 0.3 is related to patches of at a distance of 700  pc . at this distance",
    "the snr would be @xmath47  pc in size .    at this low distance",
    "the dispersion measure and rotation measure of psr  2334 + 61 become another point of debate . from the model by @xcite",
    "we get a foreground dispersion measure of dm@xmath48  @xmath5pc .",
    "but the pulsar has a dispersion measure of about @xmath49  @xmath5pc , which would give a distance of 2.5  kpc .",
    "on the other hand we also find a very high rotation measure of @xmath50  rad  m@xmath37 which combined with the dispersion measure leads to a foreground magnetic field parallel to the line of sight of b@xmath51  @xmath52 g ; which is significantly higher than the expected value of b@xmath53  @xmath52 g @xcite .",
    "the enhanced magnetic field indicates an additional structure along the line of sight with a strong magnetic field and a high electron density causing the additional dispersion and rotation measure .",
    "since the pulsar is located within a supernova remnant the nature of this additional structure should be clear .",
    "hence we now want to investigate the possibility that the shell of the expanding snr itself causes the high rm and dm values .",
    "the rotation measure rm is defined by :    @xmath54    here n@xmath55 represents the electron density in [ @xmath5 ] and l the pathlength in [ pc ] . assuming a foreground dispersion measure of dm@xmath57  @xmath5  pc and a mean foreground magnetic field along the line of sight of b@xmath53  @xmath52 g , we get internal values of dm@xmath58  @xmath5  pc , rm@xmath59  rad  m@xmath37 , and b@xmath60  @xmath52 g , for the snr .",
    "the ratio between the internal and external magnetic field strengths results in a compression of 2.4 .",
    "assuming the same compression ratio for the interstellar medium , swept up by the expanding shockwave and a radius of 7 pc gives a width of 1.2 pc for the shell . together with the internal dispersion measure we get an electron density of 38  @xmath5 within the shell . assuming the swept up material is fully ionized , a hydrogen to helium ratio of 9:1 , and again a compression ratio of 2.4 yield an average ambient density of about 14 atoms  @xmath5 .",
    "these are reasonable values and strengthen the proposed nearby location .",
    "the surrounding patches of indicate a more homogeneous ambient medium for the supernova explosion rather than a stellar wind structured one .",
    "this would indicate a b2 or later type progenitor star  since these are not massive enough to create a strong stellar wind  and a type ii supernova event .    at 700  pc distance",
    "we get a mean radius of about 7  pc for the snr . following @xcite a supernova remnant with an explosion energy of e@xmath61",
    "[ @xmath62  erg ] and an ambient medium density of n@xmath61  [ @xmath5 ] would enter the so - called pressure driven snowplow phase ( pds ) at a radius r@xmath63  [ pc ] defined by :    @xmath64    for solar abundances .",
    "for an ambient density of n@xmath65  @xmath5 and an explosion energy of e@xmath66  erg we derive r@xmath67  pc . this would indicate that g114.3 + 0.3 has already entered the pds phase and indeed it would require an explosion energy of e@xmath68  erg for the snr to be still in the so - called energy conserving sedov phase . with the above parameters we can calculate the mass of the swept up material to be m@xmath69  m@xmath70 and from the equations determined by @xcite we can also estimate an age of about 7700  yrs for g114.3 + 0.3 .",
    "as for g114.3 + 0.3 we can get additional constraints on the distance from the presence of observable optical emission @xcite and polarized 1.4  ghz radio continuum emission in the cgps ( see fig .",
    "[ pol ] ) .",
    "this indicates a local arm location , most likely closer than 2.2  kpc .",
    "the structure we found , surrounding the snr , has a radial velocity of about @xmath42  km  s@xmath2 which translates to a location within the local arm at about 1.6  kpc .",
    "similar to g114.3 + 0.3 the surrounding consists of diffuse and smooth emission patches which do not display any dynamics .",
    "it looks more like the expanding shockwave of the supernova explosion created the hole , the snr resides in , by taking away the material in the interior .",
    "hence as for g114.3 + 0.3 we believe the progenitor star was a b2 or later type star and exploded in a type ii event .",
    "the diffuse emission to the east in contrast to the sharp outer boundary to the west indicates that the star exploded inside this cloud but to the east the shockwave already left the cloud in a kind of breakout giving the snr its smooth structure in that direction .    at a distance of 1.6  kpc",
    "the snr has a mean radius of 16.5  pc .",
    "given the similarity in the emission structure to g114.3 + 0.3 we might assume that g116.5 + 1.1 has also just entered the pds phase .",
    "assuming an explosion energy of @xmath62  erg we get with equation ( 2 ) a lower limit for the ambient density of 0.8  @xmath5 .",
    "this indicates that the snr has indeed entered the pds phase because a lower density would be quite unusual for a location within a spiral arm . only within stellar wind bubbles",
    "we would expect a lower density but there is no evidence for such a structure around g116.5 + 1.1 .",
    "for an ambient density of 1  @xmath5 we would get an age of about 15000  yrs and for 5  @xmath5 about 50000  yrs .",
    "the mass of the material swept up by the expanding shockwave would be 450  m@xmath70 and 2250  m@xmath70 respectively . since the snr is still rather bright in radio continuum emission a smaller age implying an earlier evolutionary state is to be prefered .",
    "the associated shell of ctb  1 with a radial velocity of @xmath46 km s@xmath2 indicates an interarm location .",
    "but because of the complex and highly dynamic environment of the snr we believe that it must reside in one of the spiral arms : in the interarm one expects to have less material in which a remnant expands easier and more or less symmetrically .",
    "this makes ctb  1 either a blueshifted local or a redshifted perseus arm object . to make a decision we have to carefully investigate the behavior and dynamics of surrounding structures in the neutral hydrogen going from ctb  1 to the local and perseus arm ( fig .",
    "[ ch1 ] and.fig .",
    "[ ch2 ] ) to find a connection to either of them .    starting from low negative velocities in the local arm a smooth and large bubble forms around ctb  1 , best pronounced between @xmath71 km s@xmath2 and @xmath72 km s@xmath2 .",
    "this bubble was most likely created by stellar wind effects and/or supernova explosions a long time ago .",
    "the diffuse structure indicates a late stage of evolution in which the structure starts to merge with the surrounding medium . towards higher negative velocities the edges of the bubble",
    "slowly transform into bright thin filaments which are moving closer to the radio bright shell of ctb  1 with decreasing velocity .",
    "bright filamentary structures indicate a highly dynamic environment in an earlier stage of evolution where energetic interaction is still taking place . between @xmath73",
    "km s@xmath2 and @xmath46 km s@xmath2 those filaments create a bubble around ctb  1 which is closest around the radio bright shell and open to the other side where we see only smooth low surface brightness radio emission .",
    "this structure is best pronounced at @xmath46 km s@xmath2 .",
    "going from there to even higher negative velocities the structure of the bubble remains constant while it slowly fades away .",
    "at the same time smooth emission from the perseus arm is starting to move in from the south .",
    "there appears to be a connection between local arm gas and the bubble around ctb  1 , but not between ctb  1 and the perseus arm .",
    "hence ctb  1 is a blue - shifted local object .",
    "the most likely scenario to explain the observed structures and the velocity shift is that the progenitor star of ctb  1 resided in the smooth bubble visible at local arm velocities .",
    "the star was not located in the center but in the south - west and closer to us .",
    "thus the stellar wind and later the supernova shock wave impacted on the edges of the bubble first in the south - west giving the snr its half shell shape . since the progenitor of ctb  1",
    "was located closer to us relative to the center of the bubble it also hits the edges closer to us giving it a shift in velocity since this part of the bubble is moving towards us .",
    "hence the systemic velocity of the structure around ctb  1 is the same as for the smooth bubble at @xmath42 km s@xmath2 , assuming of course that this bubble is not shifted as well .",
    "the local arm position of ctb  1 is also supported by the presence of polarized emission , although it is very weak .",
    "this systemic velocity translates to a distance of 1.6 kpc .",
    "we note that both snrs g116.5 + 1.1 and ctb  1 appear to be located in the same large complex at a distance of @xmath741.6 kpc and the breakout region of g116.5 + 1.1 might even be located inside the same bubble as ctb  1 . since the structure around ctb  1 has a radial velocity of about @xmath46  km s@xmath2 it is moving towards us at a velocity of @xmath75 km s@xmath2 relative to the main body of the complex .",
    "at a distance of 1.6  kpc the linear size of the remnant would be @xmath76  pc .    with this interpretation",
    ", we can also understand the emission structure of the breakout region of ctb  1 in the radio continuum map .",
    "if the remnant is located in the south - west of the bubble rather than in its center , its shockwave arrives at the lower edge of the bubble earlier creating the bright radio shell and giving rise to its incomplete circular shape .",
    "hence the north - east opening of the remnant is not necessarily due to a breakout , but simply the result of a freely expanding shockwave which is traveling into the low density interior of the bubble .",
    "we have presented new sensitive radio continuum and data at 1@xmath17 resolution towards the three supernova remnants g114.3 + 0.3 , g116.5 + 1.1 and ctb  1 ( g116.9 + 0.2 ) . the strength of the analysis is the combination of high resolution data with large spatial coverage .",
    "g116.5 + 1.1 and ctb  1 appear to be located within the same complex .",
    "based on the surrounding structure and dynamics we derived new distance estimates for these snrs .",
    "we also concluded that g114.3 + 0.3 and g116.5 + 1.1 are expanding inside an area not much effected by stellar wind effects of their progenitors implying supernova explosions of type ii with b2 or later type progenitor stars .",
    "ctb  1 , however , is expanding in a highly dynamic environment indicating an early b or o - type progenitor star exploding in a ib or ic event .",
    "we also believe that g114.3 + 0.3 and g116.5 + 1.1 are expanding inside an area not much affected by stellar wind effects of their progenitors in which case the supernova explosions would have been type ii events with a b2 or later type progenitor star .",
    "according to our analysis g114.3 + 0.3 is the closest remnant among the three snrs with a distance of about 700  pc which gives this object a mean diameter of about 14  pc .",
    "the snr is in the so - called pressure driven snowplow phase , has swept up about 480  m@xmath70 of material and is probably around 7700  yrs old .",
    "the other two remnants are located at a distance of 1.6 kpc .",
    "this gives g116.5 + 1.1 an average diameter of 33  pc , making this snr the biggest of the three discussed here .",
    "it has also reached the pds phase and with typical snr parameters we get an age more than twice as much as g114.3 + 0.3 and probably more than 450  m@xmath70 of swept up material .",
    "ctb  1 appears to be located at the edge of a large bubble which expands with a velocity of @xmath75 km s@xmath2 towards us with respect to the systemic velocity of the whole system ( @xmath42 km s@xmath2 ) .",
    "the distance of 1.6  kpc gives the remnant a size of about 16.5  pc .",
    "we argue that the `` opening '' of ctb  1 in the northeast is not an effect of a breakout but simply the result of expanding into the interior of its surrounding bubble .",

    "<S> the other two snrs have radial velocities of @xmath117  km s@xmath2 ( g116.5 + 1.1 ) and @xmath127  km s@xmath2 ( ctb  1 ) according to related . </S>",
    "<S> however , the structure of the and its dynamics in velocity space suggest a possible relation between them , placing both remnants at a distance of about 1.6  kpc . </S>",
    "<S> ctb  1 appears to be embedded in an feature which is moving as a whole towards us with a velocity of about 10  km s@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the off - centered location of ctb  1 in a large bubble indicates that the so - called breakout region of the remnant is in fact due to its expansion towards the low density interior of this bubble . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the progenitor star of ctb  1 was an early b or o - type star shaping its environment with a strong stellar wind in which case it exploded in a ib or ic event . </S>"
