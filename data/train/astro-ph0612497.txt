    "there is a growing need for a complete census of agn activity .",
    "the seminal discovery that every massive galaxy in the local universe harbors a super - massive black hole ( smbh ; @xmath7  @xmath8 ) implies that all galaxies have hosted agn activity at some time during the past @xmath9  13  gyrs ( e.g.,@xcite ; @xcite ) . to accurately trace how and when these smbhs grew requires a detailed census of agn activity that will provide , amongst other things , constraints on the efficiency and duty cycle of smbh growth .",
    "the finding that the mass of the smbh is proportional to that of the galaxy spheroid also indicates that the growth of smbhs and their host galaxies are regulated in some way ( e.g. ,  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "whether or not this growth occured concordantly is unknown but comparisons between the rate of star formation and smbh growth , both in individual objects and from a cosmic census , will provide important insight .",
    "since obscured agns outnumber unobscured agns by a factor of @xmath9  310 , any `` complete '' census of agn activity must be sensitive to the detection and identification of obscured sources .",
    "x - ray emission is relatively impervious to obscuration , at least at high energies , and the detection of luminous or hard x - ray emission provides an almost unambiguous identification of agn activity even in the absence of source redshifts .",
    "for this reason , the most complete census of agn activity to date is provided by deep x - ray surveys .",
    "for example , the 2  ms _ chandra _ deep field north ( cdf - n ; @xcite ) survey identifies a @xmath10 times larger agn source density ( @xmath9  7200  deg@xmath11 , @xcite ) than found in optical surveys ; see fig .",
    "1a for the sensitivity of the cdf - n to agn objects .",
    "however , although deep x - ray surveys have proved stunningly effective at identifying both obscured and unobscured agn activity ( see @xcite for an overall review ) , there is clear evidence that a large fraction of the agn population remains undetected in the ( observed frame ) band probed by these surveys : ( 1 ) about half of the x - ray background is unresolved at @xmath12  kev ( @xcite ) , ( 2 ) the obscured : unobscured agn ratio is much lower than that found for comparably luminous agns in the local universe ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , and ( 3 ) few compton - thick agns ( @xmath13  cm@xmath11 ) have been identified , even though they comprise @xmath9  50% of the agn population in the local universe ( e.g. ,  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "many of these x - ray undetected agns are likely to be intrinsically luminous sources that are heavily obscured ( @xmath1510  @xmath16  cm@xmath11 ) by an optically and geometrically thick torus of gas and dust ( e.g. ,  @xcite ; see fig .",
    "1a for the detectability of the intrinsically luminous agn in ngc  1068 in the observations ) .",
    "although the primary emission from these obscured agns will be absorbed by the torus and rendered weak or invisible at x - ray ",
    "optical wavelengths , it will heat the dust grains and re - emit this emission relatively isotropically in the infrared ( ir ) waveband ( rest - frame @xmath17  @xmath18 m ; e.g. ,  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the intrinsically luminous but x - ray undetected agns should therefore be detected in deep ir surveys ; see fig .",
    "radio - loud agns or to agn activity in nearby galaxies ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "future radio observatories such as the square kilometer array will provide an extremely sensitive agn census but will not be _ fully _ operational for @xmath10 years ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) ; see http://www.skatelescope.org/. ] since star formation can also produce luminous ir emission it is necessary to distinguish between agns and starburst galaxies .",
    "a number of recent studies have demonstrated that ir colours can often distinguish between agn and star - formation activity using crude ir data , with the former having `` hotter '' ir spectral energy distributions ( seds ; e.g. ,  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , since a large fraction of the agn population in the local universe has ir colors similar to those of starburst galaxies , other indicators ( e.g. ,  the detection of high - excitation emission lines , hard x - ray emission from stacking analyses of samples of objects , and luminous unresolved radio emission ) are also required to identify agn activity from star formation .",
    "the primary aim of this article is to investigate the prospects for selecting x - ray undetected agn with _",
    "observations in the ultra - deep cdf - n / goods",
    "- n field to increase the agn census beyond that identified from the x - ray data alone .",
    "here we select x - ray undetected agn candidates using the _ spitzer _ goods - n observations and then search for the presence of hard x - ray emission using x - ray stacking techniques . from these results we place constraints on the demographics and properties of agn activity in the ir galaxy population .",
    "the _ spitzer _ goods observations ( p.i .",
    "m.  dickinson ) were performed as part of the _ spitzer _ legacy program and cover @xmath9  160  arcmin@xmath19 of the most sensitive regions in each of the _ chandra _ deep fields ( the cdf - n and the cdf - s ) .",
    "the irac 3.68  @xmath18 m and mips 24  @xmath18 m _ spitzer _ observations are the deepest across the sky , achieving typical 1  @xmath20 sensitivities of @xmath9  0.030.3  @xmath18jy ( 3.68  @xmath18 m ) and @xmath9  5  @xmath18jy ( 24  @xmath18 m ) . here",
    "we focus on the cdf - n / goods - n field , which has the deepest x - ray coverage to date . to provide maximum sensitivity to x - ray faint agn activity",
    "we restrict our analyses to the region within 5.5  arcmin of the _ chandra _ aimpoint ( 95  arcmin@xmath19 ) , where the x - ray sensitivity and angular resolution is optimal ; see figs .",
    "18 & 19 of @xcite .",
    "there are 223 x - ray sources , @xmath9  1800 mips 24  @xmath18 m sources , and @xmath9  3400 irac 8  @xmath18 m sources within this region .",
    "the x - ray sources were matched to the ir sources on the basis of the x - ray source positional uncertainties given in @xcite .",
    "the positional uncertainites were linearly increased to give a 3% spurious source match fraction ; extensive monte - carlo tests were used to determine the spurious match fraction .",
    "overall , 78% and 87% of the x - ray sources were matched to 24  @xmath18 m and 8  @xmath18 m sources , respectively .",
    "using the multi - wavelength source classification of @xcite we distinguished between x - ray detected agns and x - ray detected starbursts .",
    "the x - ray sources comprise 9.4% of the 24  @xmath18 m source population ( 7.0% x - ray agns and 2.4% x - ray starbursts ) and 5.6% of the 8  @xmath18 m source population ( 4.3% x - ray agns and 1.3% x - ray starbursts ) .",
    "2 shows the x - ray vs 24  @xmath18 m properties of the x - ray sources , including the x - ray agns and x - ray starburst fraction for different 24  @xmath18 m flux density bins .",
    "as expected , the majority of the x - ray agns have x - ray  ir flux ratios higher than those of the x - ray starbursts .",
    ".  2 also shows a clear drop in the x - ray detected fraction of ir sources towards the faintest ir fluxes .",
    "this is at least partially due to the linear decrease in the observed x - ray  ir flux ratio with 24  @xmath18 m flux density , suggesting that the majority of the x - ray undetected agn population will have faint ir fluxes.m flux - density bins but it is at least qualitatively similar to the conclusions drawn from the agn population synthesis model of @xcite . ]",
    "evidence for an x - ray undetected agn population can be explored using stacking techniques .",
    "the principle behind this approach is to stack the x - ray data of individually undetected _ spitzer _ sources and determine the probability that the stacked x - ray signal could be produced by the background ( e.g. ,  @xcite ; the background is determined from a monte - carlo analysis of source - excluded regions around the stacked sources .",
    "the expected signature of a significant obscured agn population is a detection in the hard ( 28  kev ) band and a comparatively flat x - ray spectral slope ( @xmath21 ) . by comparison ,",
    "unobscured / low - luminosity agn and typical starburst galaxies have softer x - ray spectral slopes ( @xmath22  2 ; e.g. ,  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we note that neutron - star x - ray binary populations can also have flat x - ray spectral slopes ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , however , it seems unlikely that the integrated x - ray emission from a starburst galaxy will be dominated by this comparatively rare galactic population .    for the stacking analyses we have used the procedure outlined in @xcite and stacked _ spitzer _ galaxies in the soft ( 0.52  kev ) , hard ( 28  kev ) , and full ( 0.58  kev ) bands .",
    "the background was determined using 1,000 monte - carlo trials for each stacked source and the x - ray counts were measured using apertures based on the 90% encircled - energy radius .",
    "stacking all of the x - ray undetected ir sources we obtain highly significant detections ( @xmath23  10  @xmath20 ) in all three x - ray bands , corresponding to an overall x - ray spectral slope of @xmath24 and suggesting that some of the stacked sources are likely to be obscured agns ( contrast with the @xmath25 result obtained by @xcite using shallower 15  @xmath18 m data over a smaller area ) ; this is further confirmed by a 3.5  @xmath20 detection in the ultra - hard ( 48  kev ) band .",
    "we also stacked the data in the 68  kev band and obtained a non detection in this band ; the 3  @xmath20 upper limit corresponds to @xmath26  20% of the 68  kev background .",
    "if a substantial fraction of the x - ray background is unresolved in the 68  kev band by current x - ray surveys , as suggested by the analyses of @xcite , then the other contributing sources must be either ir - faint ( @xmath27  @xmath18jy ) or comparatively rare in @xmath9  100  arcmin@xmath19 regions .    a basic interpretation of the data in fig .",
    "2 is that x - ray undetected agns will be predominantly detected at the faintest ir fluxes . to test this simple prediction we stacked the x - ray data for individually undetected sources in different 24  @xmath18 m flux - density bins ;",
    "see fig .",
    "the 28  kev stacked flux generally increases towards fainter 24  @xmath18 m flux densities , suggesting an increase in the contribution from obscured agn activity , with the @xmath28  75225  @xmath18jy bin producing the strongest and hardest x - ray signal .",
    "however , the softer x - ray spectral slope for sources with @xmath29  2575  @xmath18jy implies that starburst galaxies probably dominate the stacked x - ray emission at the faintest ir fluxes .",
    "furthermore , the comparatively weak 28  kev flux suggests that there may be fewer obscured agns than at @xmath28  75225  @xmath18jy , possibly indicating a genuine drop in the number of obscured agns at low ir luminosities or at high redshifts ( @xmath30  75  @xmath18jy corresponds to @xmath31  @xmath3 at @xmath32 ) .",
    "these results are qualitatively similar to those expected from the agn population synthesis model of @xcite and the interpretation of shallower _ spitzer _ and x - ray data by @xcite .",
    "more detailed analyses are required to provide definitive conclusions .",
    "we can also explore the average x - ray properties of the _ spitzer _ sources as a function of ir spectral slope ( @xmath33 , where @xmath34  @xmath33  @xmath35 ) .",
    "in the local universe many agns have flat ir spectral slopes while starburst galaxies are often distinguished by steeper ir spectral slopes .",
    "@xcite investigated the detailed properties of _ spitzer _ galaxies with flat ir spectral slopes ( @xmath36 ) in the 1  ms cdf - s field and deduced that only @xmath9  50% of these ir - selected agns are detected in the x - ray band .",
    "although the flat ir spectral slopes of these sources clearly indicate that they host agn activity , they are comparatively rare ( @xmath9  800 sources deg@xmath11 , including both x - ray detected and x - ray detected agns ) and unlikely to dominate the unresolved @xmath37  kev background . as a comparison , the range of ir spectral slopes for the x - ray detected agn in the cdf - n / goods - n dataset is @xmath381.0 , and only @xmath9  30% have @xmath36 , indicating that many have ir spectral properties more consistent with those of starburst galaxies . since the aim of the study here is to provide the most complete census of agn activity , we have stacked the x - ray data of _ spitzer _ galaxies over a wide range of ir spectral slopes ( @xmath36 , @xmath390.0 , @xmath40  0.00.5 , @xmath40  0.51.0 ) . the x - ray spectral slope and 28  kev flux density of the stacked sources are shown in fig .",
    "all are significantly detected in the 28  kev band but the strongest and hardest x - ray signal comes from the sources with the steepest ir spectral slope ( @xmath40  0.51.0 ) .",
    "the steep ir spectral slope of these sources does not obviously imply the presence of agn activity but the hard x - ray signal ( @xmath41  1.2 ) indicates that a considerable fraction of the sources host obscured agn activity .",
    "motivated by the discovery that sources with @xmath42  75  @xmath18jy show greater evidence for x - ray undetected agn activity ( see fig .",
    "3a ) , we further stacked the sources in two different 24  @xmath18 m flux bins ( @xmath28  2575  @xmath18jy and @xmath30  75  @xmath18jy ) .",
    "the flatter x - ray spectral slope ( @xmath43 ) and larger 28  kev flux density of the @xmath42  75  @xmath18jy sources with @xmath40  0.51.0 clearly indicates that the majority of the obscured agns reside in this population .",
    "the x - ray stacking analyses provide evidence that a large x - ray undetected agn population does indeed reside in the _ spitzer _ galaxy population .",
    "the dominant agn population has an ir spectral slope of @xmath40  0.51.0 and @xmath30  75  @xmath18jy .",
    "their ir colors are more similar to starburst galaxies than agns but x - ray stacking analyses indicate that they host obscured agn activity .",
    "we can gain further insight into the properties of these sources by investigating their median redshifts , luminosities , and source densities .",
    "the median spectroscopic redshift of the @xmath40  0.51.0 _ spitzer _ galaxies is @xmath1  0.8 , which corresponds to an median luminosity of @xmath44  @xmath3 ; the majority of the redshifts were taken from @xcite . assuming this median redshift , the 28  kev luminosity of the stacked sources with @xmath40  0.51.0 and @xmath30  75  @xmath18jy is @xmath45  erg  s@xmath6 ( rest - frame 3.614.4  kev ) .",
    "this x - ray luminosity should be considered a lower limit since ( 1 ) many of the stacked galaxies will not be agns and their inclusion in the stacking analysis will decrease the average 28  kev flux , and ( 2 ) the luminosity has not been corrected for the presence of instrinsic absorption .",
    "these two issues are briefly considered below .",
    "we can not directly determine the `` dilution '' to the hard - band x - ray signal from non - agn activity , however , we can place constraints from the non - detection of individual sources in the x - ray data .",
    "for example , if the x - ray undetected agn represented just 1% of the stacked ir galaxies but contributed all of the 28  kev flux then they would have individual 28  kev luminosities @xmath9  2 orders of magnitude higher and would be individually detected in the x - ray data .",
    "therefore , since the stacked 28  kev flux is an order of magnitude below the individual x - ray sensitivity limit , these x - ray undetected agns are likely to represent @xmath10% of the stacked ir galaxies .",
    "this indicates an average _ observed _",
    "( i.e. ,  uncorrected for absorption ) 28  kev luminosity of @xmath45@xmath46  erg  s@xmath6 and places lower limits on the x - ray undetected obscured agn source density of @xmath9  5005,000  deg@xmath11 ( for agns with @xmath40  0.51.0 and @xmath30  75  @xmath18jy ) .    a crude constraint on the amount of absorption towards the agns can be determined from the average x - ray spectral slope for a given agn model ( e.g. ,  an observed x - ray spectral slope of @xmath41  1.0 from a @xmath1  0.8 agn would imply @xmath47  @xmath48  cm  s@xmath11 for a simple intrinsic agn power - law spectrum of @xmath25 ) . since the soft - band flux almost certainly has a large contribution from star - formation activity , this approach effectively provides a lower limit on the true absorbing column density .",
    "another approach , albeit very uncertain , is to estimate the _ intrinsic _ ( i.e. ,  corrected for absorption ) x - ray luminosity of the agns from the ir luminosities and then compare this to the observed x - ray luminosity . under the assumption that 10100% of the ir luminosity is powered by an agn ,",
    "the median x - ray luminosity of these sources estimated from the @xcite sed is @xmath49@xmath50  erg  s@xmath6 , suggesting large amounts of absorption ( @xmath51  cm@xmath11 ) .",
    "although these analyses on the properties of the x - ray undetected agns are crude , their estimated properties are qualitatively consistent with those required by @xcite to produce the unresolved x - ray background ( i.e. ,  @xmath1  0.51.5 , @xmath52@xmath53  cm@xmath11 , @xmath54@xmath50  erg  s@xmath6 ) .",
    "interestingly , the median redshift , ir luminosity , and x - ray luminosity range of the x - ray detected agns with @xmath40  0.51.0 are also similar to those estimated for the x - ray undetected agns with @xmath40  0.51.0 .",
    "this is entirely consistent with that expected for the unified agn model , where the x - ray undetected agns represent the more heavily obscured counterparts of the x - ray detected agns .",
    "detailed observations of individual objects are now required to elucidate the properties of this x - ray undetected agn population .",
