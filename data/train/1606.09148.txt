    "heisenberg was the first to realize , in 1927 , that uncertainty relations exist for quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "his physical arguments were quickly developed by kennard @xcite , weyl @xcite , robertson @xcite and schrdinger @xcite . except for heisenberg",
    "s paper , the focus of these contributions was on preparational uncertainty , not yet clearly distinguished from measurement uncertainty . in 1965 , arthurs and kelly presented a model of joint measurement of position and momentum @xcite , laying the foundations for interest in error - disturbance uncertainty relations , which has grown considerably over the last    in recent years , the discussion of uncertainty relations has turned from conceptual aspects to applications , in line with the overall thrust of quantum information .",
    "for example , the first protocol of quantum cryptography , known as bb84 @xcite , is based on pairs of mutual unbiased bases that are known to come with maximal preparational uncertainty .",
    "it is also possible to use variance - based uncertainty relations to formulate criteria which detect entangled states of bi - partite systems @xcite .",
    "this work investigates the structure of preparational uncertainty relations in quantum systems with more than one continuous variable , i.e. , @xmath2 .",
    "examples are given by a point particle moving in a plane ( @xmath3 ) or in three - dimensional space ( @xmath4 ; alternatively , one may consider @xmath0 particles each moving along a real line , each with configuration space @xmath5 .",
    "our main goals are ( i ) to obtain lower bounds for given smooth functions depending on the @xmath1 second moments of a system with @xmath0 continuous variables , ( ii ) turn these bounds into criteria that enable us to detect entangled states , and ( iii ) to understand the geometric structure of uncertainty functionals in the space of second moments , spanned by the independent elements of the covariance matrix .    using a variational technique originally introduced by jackiw @xcite",
    ", we will generalize an approach that has been carried out successfully for quantum systems with a single particle - type degree of freedom , i.e. , @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "encouraged by the new uncertainty relations obtained in this way for a single continuous variable , we are particularly interested in the possibility to create inequalities that are capable of detecting entangled states in systems with two or more continuous variables .",

    "the pure states of the quantum systems considered here are represented by unit vectors @xmath14 , elements of an infinite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath15 . of the @xmath16 second  moments @xmath17 only @xmath1 are independent .",
    "we assume ( without loss of generality ) that all first moments vanish , which follows from the invariance of the second moments under rigid phase - space translations . the  second moments @xmath18 form the _ covariance matrix _ @xmath19 associated with the pure state @xmath20 .    with @xmath21 and for @xmath22 ( @xmath23 )",
    ", we obtain the variance of momentum ( position ) of the @xmath8-th degree of freedom , while for @xmath24 , we obtain their covariance ; all  other values of the indices @xmath25 , correspond to moments that mix different degrees of freedom . occasionally , we will denote the variances of the @xmath8-th momentum and position with @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , and their covariance by @xmath28 .    given a real function of the second moments for @xmath0 continuous variables , @xmath29 @xmath30 , we  wish to establish whether it has a non - trivial lower bound @xmath31 .",
    "if it does , the statement @xmath32 provides an uncertainty relation .",
    "following an idea of jackiw @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , we define _ _ an _ uncertainty functional _ associated with the function @xmath33 by @xmath34 & = f\\left(\\delta^{2}p_{1},\\delta^{2}q_{1},c_{p_{1}q_{1}},\\ldots c_{p_{1}p_{2}},c_{p_{1}q_{2}},\\dots\\right)-\\lambda(\\braket{\\psi}{\\psi}-1)\\,\\nonumber \\\\   & = f\\left(x_{1},y_{1},w_{1},\\ldots , c_{13},c_{14},\\dots\\right)-\\lambda(\\braket{\\psi}{\\psi}-1)\\ , \\label{ufn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the lagrange multiplier @xmath35 ensures that any solutions will be given by a normalised state . we  first list all _ local _ second moments for each degree of freedom ( the two variances and the covariance ) , followed by the _ non - local _ moments which involve different degrees of freedom .",
    "a variation of such a  functional will , in analogy to the one - dimensional case ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , lead to an eigenvalue equation quadratic in position and momentum operators .",
    "let us briefly spell out the derivation in the more general setting .",
    "first , we compare the value of the functional @xmath36 $ ] in the state @xmath37 with its value in the state @xmath20 , where @xmath38 is an arbitrary normalised state . expanding it up to a second order in the small parameter @xmath39",
    ", we find @xmath40=j[\\psi]+\\varepsilon d_{\\varepsilon}j[\\psi]+o\\left(\\varepsilon^{2}\\right ) \\label{functionalexpansion}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the expression @xmath41 denotes a gteaux derivative .",
    "the stationary points of the functional are characterised by the vanishing of the first - order term in the expansion ( [ functionalexpansion ] ) , @xmath42=\\bra e\\left(\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta\\bra{\\psi}}f\\left(x_{1},y_{1},w_{1},\\ldots , c_{13},c_{14},\\dots\\right)-\\lambda\\ket{\\psi}\\right)+\\text{c.c.}=0\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    more explicitly , this condition reads @xmath43 where the sum runs over the values @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "since equation should hold for arbitrary variations of the ket @xmath46 and its dual @xmath47 ( which are independent ) , the expression in round brackets as well as its complex conjugate must vanish identically .",
    "the functional derivatives of the second moments are @xmath48 resulting in a _ euler - lagrange_-type equation @xmath49    the value of the multiplier @xmath35 can be found by multiplying this equation with the bra @xmath50 from the left and solving for @xmath35 . substituting its value back into equation  ( [ eq : condition with lambda ] ) ,",
    "one finds the nonlinear eigenvector - eigenvalue equation @xmath51 or , in matrix notation , @xmath52 where the matrix @xmath53 is defined in terms of the first partial derivatives of the function @xmath33 : its diagonal elements are equal to @xmath54 , while the off - diagonal ones are given by @xmath55 with @xmath56 , using the standard convention to denote partial derivatives by subscripts . as an example",
    ", the eigenvalue equation becomes , for @xmath3 , @xmath57    note that equation is generally non - linear in the state @xmath20 since the second moments and the partial derivatives of @xmath33 are functions of expectation values in the state @xmath20 .",
    "as we will show in next section , one can nevertheless solve equation , given a number of assumptions .      to solve equation",
    ", we initially assume that the matrix @xmath53 of partial derivatives is _ constant _ , i.e. , we suppress its dependence on the state @xmath20 .",
    "if we further require that @xmath53 is positive definite , then  williamson s theorem @xcite guarantees the existence of a symplectic matrix @xmath58 that puts @xmath53 into a  diagonal form , i.e. , @xmath59 where the diagonal matrix @xmath60 is defined by @xmath61 , and the positive real numbers @xmath62 , @xmath63 , are the _ symplectic eigenvalues _ of @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "we recall that a symplectic matrix of order @xmath64 satisfies @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is uniquely determined by the commutation relations , @xmath67=i\\hbar\\omega_{\\mu\\nu}$ ] , @xmath68 .",
    "multiplying both sides of equation with the metaplectic unitary operator @xmath69 from the left , defined by the relation @xmath70 we find that its left - hand - side can be expressed as @xmath71    thus , equation simplifies to @xmath72 which can be written as @xmath73    thus , we have transformed the quadratic operator on the left - hand - side of equation into a  hamiltonian operator given by a sum of @xmath0 decoupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "the solutions of equation   are given by tensor products of number states for each degree of freedom : @xmath74    note that the constraint @xmath75 must be satisfied by all potential extremal states .",
    "recall that we have treated the matrix elements of the matrix @xmath53 introduced in equation as constants , on which the unitary transformation @xmath76 and hence the states @xmath20 in equation now depend . to achieve consistency , we determine the expectation value of the covariance matrix in the solution  @xmath20 .",
    "a set of coupled equations in matrix form results for the extremal second moments , which we will call the _ consistency conditions_. explicitly , we find @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes the kronecker product of the column vector @xmath11 with its transpose , @xmath79 . using the identity in the form @xmath80",
    ", we can express the covariance matrix in the form    @xmath81    with the matrix @xmath82 having elements @xmath83    recalling that the components of the vector @xmath84 are position and momentum operators , it is not difficult to see that the only non - zero matrix elements of @xmath85 are on its diagonal , i.e. , @xmath86    using the property @xmath87 , which holds for any diagonal matrix , we finally obtain the _ consistency conditions _ for @xmath0 continuous variables , @xmath88    these conditions select the extrema that are compatible with the specific function of the second  moments considered .",
    "the constraint given in can be rewritten as @xmath89 and it is easy to check that this condition is trivially satisfied if the consistency conditions hold .",
    "the take - away message from the conditions can be summarised as follows : _ a function @xmath33 of the second moments of @xmath0 positions and momenta has an extremum in a pure state @xmath20 if there exists a symplectic matrix _",
    "@xmath58 _ that diagonalises the covariance matrix @xmath19 and , at the same time , the transpose of its inverse , @xmath90 , diagonalises the matrix @xmath53 of the partial derivatives of the function @xmath33_.    according to , the determinant of the covariance matrix for extremal states of the uncertainty functional @xmath36 $ ] takes the value @xmath91    clearly , the minimum is achieved when each oscillator resides in its ground state , @xmath92 corresponding to @xmath93 in equation .",
    "no pure @xmath0-particle state can give rise to a covariance matrix @xmath19 violating the inequality .",
    "this universally valid constraint generalizes the single - particle inequality derived by robertson and schrdinger to @xmath0 particles , expressing it elegantly as a condition on the determinant of the covariance matrix of a state .",
    "supplying with the lower - dimensional robertson - schrdinger - type inequalities that need to be obeyed in by each subsystem of dimension @xmath94 to @xmath95 , we get the general uncertainty statement for more than one degrees of freedom , usually expressed in the form , @xmath96    alternatively , this requirement can be expressed in terms of inequalities for the symplectic eigenvalues of the covariance matrix @xcite .",
    "we conclude this section by explicitly working out the consistency conditions for one degree of freedom , @xmath6 . in this case",
    ", we obtain the matrices @xmath97 and @xmath98 , with symplectic matrices @xmath99 and @xmath100 given by @xmath101 respectively , and real parameters @xmath102    the consistency conditions now take the simple form @xmath103 or finally , @xmath104    therefore , the formalism developed here correctly reproduces the findings of @xcite .",
    "let us now examine the consistency conditions for more than one degree of freedom while allowing only _ product _ states .",
    "correlations between the degrees of freedom being absent , the functional will only depend on the _ local _ second moments , i.e. , @xmath105 ; the @xmath106 moments mixing the degrees of freedom are always zero in a separable state . for simplicity ,",
    "we only consider @xmath3 in some detail , the generalisation to @xmath107 being straightforward .    using matrices @xmath99 and @xmath100 defined in , we construct two symplectic matrices @xmath108 and @xmath109 as  follows : @xmath110    their product , @xmath111 describes the action of the factorised unitary operator @xmath112 when solving the eigenvalue equation .",
    "the consistency conditions become @xmath113 with @xmath114 so that we finally obtain @xmath115    in equation , the @xmath116 matrices @xmath117 , denote the collection of partial derivatives of the function @xmath33 with respect to the moments of the @xmath8-th degree of freedom . therefore , the consistency conditions for functionals of product states reduce to a pair of one - dimensional ones that must be solved simultaneously .",
    "the generalisation to @xmath0 degrees of freedom is straightforward : for each extra degree of freedom , a matrix @xmath118 must be added to the diagonal of the block matrix @xmath119 . after introducing the suitably generalized matrices @xmath19 and",
    "@xmath85 , equation describes the consistency conditions for separable quantum states .",
    "it is often useful to express equation as @xmath120 with @xmath63 .",
    "the simplest example of a factorized uncertainty relation is given by the product of two one - dimensional robertson - schrdinger inequalities , following from the functional @xmath121    the resulting inequality , @xmath122 corresponds to the boundary described by equation in the absence of correlations , to  be discussed in more detail in section [ sec : uncertainty - region ] . note that this inequality is only invariant under @xmath123 transformations instead of those of the @xmath124 group that leave invariant the robertson  schrdinger - type inequality for two degrees of freedom",
    "however , the matrix inequality @xmath125 is invariant under any symplectic transformation and serves as the required  generalisation .",
    "starting from the functional @xmath126 we arrive -after solving - at @xmath127 which can not be obtained by a combination of inequalities for @xmath6 .",
    "it is _ stronger _ than the ( factorized ) `` heisenberg''-type inequality for more than two observables @xmath128 first mentioned in a paper by robertson @xcite , but _",
    "weaker _ than .",
    "an inequality @xmath129 is said to be _ weaker _ than the inequality @xmath130 if _ fewer _ states saturate @xmath129 than @xmath130 .",
    "mixing products of variances related to different degrees of freedom also leads to non - trivial inequalities such as @xmath131    for @xmath132 and @xmath133 , one obtains @xmath134 which resembles the inequality for the sum of two one - dimensional heisenberg inequalities , @xmath135 but differs fundamentally from it .",
    "dropping the limitation to product states , we now turn to functionals that involve terms to which different degrees of freedom contribute .",
    "to begin , let us consider a linear combination of second  moments , @xmath136 for which the matrix @xmath53 takes the form @xmath137    it is positive definite whenever the coefficients @xmath138 obey the conditions @xmath139 and @xmath140 , which we assume from now on . the symplectic matrix @xmath141 that brings @xmath53 to diagonal form",
    "is given by ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath142 where @xmath143    the consistency conditions can be solved in closed form , leading to the covariance matrix at @xmath144 with elements explicitly given by @xmath145 and @xmath146    one can check that the expressions on the right - hand side of equations and are positive , while @xmath147 also hold , as required . in fact , these two inequalities are never saturated by the extremal states , although one can get arbitrarily close if @xmath148 is zero , while @xmath149 tends to infinity ( or vice versa ) .",
    "substituting the extremal values of the second moments back into the functional , we find @xmath150 implying the following inequality , satisfied by any quantum state : @xmath151    pure separable states are known to satisfy the relation @xmath152    now consider the limit @xmath153 in which , however , breaks the positive definiteness of @xmath53 : its right - hand - side tends to zero and the terms on the left are just the sum of the variances of the einstein - podolsky - rosen - type ( epr ) operators @xmath154 and @xmath155 @xcite . in this case , the  pair of inequalities and form the prototypical example of using uncertainty relations for entanglement  detection . more specifically ,",
    "whenever the sum of the variances of @xmath156 and @xmath157 in a given state @xmath20 violates the bound of , then the state is entangled .",
    "although inequality provides only a sufficient condition for inseparability of an arbitrary state , it can become a sufficient and necessary condition for pure gaussian states , if recast in an appropriate form @xcite .",
    "returning to inequality in the case of arbitrary @xmath138 , it is not immediately obvious whether it can be used to detect entangled states .",
    "however , let us define four epr - type operators : @xmath158 with eight real parameters @xmath159 , which are constrained by the relations @xmath160    now , we can write equation as @xmath161 reducing to the inequality @xmath162 if the the system resides in a separable state . since its right - hand - side is always greater than or equal to the bound in , the violation of indicates the presence of an entangled state .    clearly , inequality is more general than the corresponding one for the pair of operators @xmath154 and @xmath155 , as the former reduces to the latter in the limit @xmath153 and thus extends a known result @xcite .    as a final example , consider the sum of the variances of the epr - type operators for _ three _ degrees of freedom , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , which is in general only bounded by zero .",
    "however , the lower possible value achievable in a _",
    "separable _ state is given by the inequality @xmath166 readily obtained from the solution of equation .",
    "again , violations of detect the presence of entangled degrees of freedom .",
    "it is , of course , possible to minimise other functions than the sum of the variances , leading to different entanglement - detecting inequalities that we will discuss elsewhere .",
    "in this section , we will develop a geometric view of quantum uncertainty for a system with @xmath0 continuous variables .",
    "to do so , we associate a direction of the space @xmath167 with each of the second  moments @xmath168 .",
    "then , any quantum state gives rise to a point in the _ space of second moments _",
    ", @xmath169 which has dimension @xmath170 .",
    "some points in the space @xmath171 will represent moments of quantum states while others will  not . the accessible part of the space is called the _",
    "uncertainty region _",
    ", as the points it contains are in one - to - one correspondence with admissible covariance matrices @xmath172 .",
    "this region is bounded by a  @xmath173-dimensional surface given by the relation @xmath174 where @xmath66 is the standard symplectic matrix of order @xmath175 .",
    "we will show now that the uncertainty region in the space @xmath177 is a _ convex _ set , by affirming ( i ) that its _ boundary _ is convex and ( ii ) that all points of the uncertainty region emerge as expectations taken in _ pure _ states .",
    "in other words , the uncertainty region has no `` pure - state holes . ''",
    "this property justifies our initial decision to search for extrema of uncertainty functionals among pure states only : no other extrema would result had we included mixed states . on",
    "the boundary of the uncertainty region , the relationship between quantum states and their moments is unique ( up to rigid translations ) while ( iii ) points inside the uncertainty region can also be obtained from infinitely many different convex combinations of pure ( or mixed ) states .",
    "the region defined by equation is a _ convex _ set in the @xmath1-dimensional space of second moments . to see this , we consider two covariance matrices @xmath178 and @xmath179 that are located on its boundary given by , i.e.",
    ", they satisfy @xmath180    we recall that covariance matrices are positive definite , @xmath181 , and that they must have sufficiently large symplectic eigenvalues in order to stem from quantum states .",
    "convexity holds if the ( positive definite ) convex combination of two covariance matrices , @xmath182\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] either lies on the boundary of the uncertainty region or in its interior .",
    "this property follows from the fact that the matrix function @xmath183 is convex @xcite , i.e. , the inequality @xmath184 holds for any pair of strictly positive definite matrices , @xmath185 . rewriting in the form @xmath186 one",
    "immediately finds that @xmath187\\leq - t\\ln\\det\\left(\\mathbf{c}_{1}/\\hbar\\right)-(1-t)\\ln\\det\\left(\\mathbf{c}_{2}/\\hbar\\right)=2n\\ln2\\,\\ ] ]    since @xmath188\\ , \\label{eq : convexity for covariance matrices}\\ ] ] follows , and we have shown that the convex combination of two covariance matrices on the boundary of the uncertainty region can not produce a point outside of it .",
    "equality holds in only if @xmath189 or @xmath190 .",
    "therefore , states on the boundary can not be written as mixtures , which means that the states on the boundary must be pure states .",
    "clearly , the argument just given extends to convex combinations of covariance matrices located _ inside _ the uncertainty region : no such combination will produce a covariance matrix on its boundary or outside of it .",
    "we determined the conditions for uncertainty functionals to have extrema by evaluating them on all _ pure _ states of @xmath0 quantum particles .",
    "we now show that the inclusion of mixed states as potential extrema does not change our findings .",
    "it is sufficient to show that all points of the uncertainty region defined by the inequality correspond to covariance matrices that stem from pure states .",
    "recall that any admissible covariance matrix can be diagonalised according to williamson s theorem @xcite using a suitable symplectic transformation .",
    "let us order its @xmath0 finite symplectic eigenvalues @xmath191 to @xmath192 from smallest to largest and choose an integer @xmath193 such that @xmath194 holds .",

    "remark after [ 1.0]equation ( [ second moments definition ] ) ) .",
    "thus , a suitable value of the parameter @xmath197 leads to the desired entries @xmath198 on the diagonal of the covariance matrix , and the covariance of position and momentum @xmath9 and @xmath10 equals zero .",
    "the remaining off - diagonal matrix elements  associated with the bilinear operators @xmath199 for @xmath200also vanish in the product  state @xmath201    consequently , there is a pure product state , namely @xmath202 , to generate any desired _",
    "diagonal _ covariance matrix  which is sufficient to create any admissible _ non - diagonal _ covariance matrix ,    the map from the set of pure states to the interior of the space of moments is , of course , many - to - one .",
    "this can be seen directly by recalling that each admissible covariance matrix @xmath19 can also be obtained from a gaussian state characterized by a quadratic form determined by the matrix @xmath19 .",
    "given any point inside the uncertainty region , one can find infinitely many convex combinations of two pure gaussian states on the boundary that produce the desired @xmath1 moments . here",
    "is one way to construct such pairs .",
    "consider any two - dimensional euclidean plane that passes through the origin of the space of moments , @xmath203 , and the given point inside the uncertainty region .",
    "the  intersection of its boundary with the plane is a one - dimensional set of points that divides the plane into two regions corresponding to acceptable covariance matrices ( forming the uncertainty region ) and the rest .",
    "this line inherits convexity from the boundary in the space @xmath177 since any two  points on the curve are , of course , also located on the high - dimensional boundary .    to conclude the argument",
    ", we only need to identify two points on the boundary such that the line connecting them goes through the point representing the desired set of moments .",
    "it is geometrically obvious that there exist infinitely many pairs of points on the boundary that satisfy this requirement .",
    "this situation is illustrated in figure [ fig : convex uncertainty region ] in section [ par : convex combinations of pure ] for a single continuous variable where the boundary of the uncertainty region is known to be a hyperbola .",
    "it is instructive to study the properties of the uncertainty region for a single continuous variable since the space of moments has only three dimensions .",
    "even in the absence of entangled states , the uncertainty region has a number of interesting features as it resembles the bloch ball used to visualize the states of a qubit .",
    "for one continuous variable , each point inside the uncertainty region is characterized uniquely by a triple of numbers , the states on the convex boundary are the only pure states , and the decomposition of mixed states into pairs of pure states is clearly not unique .",
    "the group of @xmath204 transformations that leave the uncertainty region invariant play the role of the @xmath205 transformations mapping the bloch ball to itself .",

    "the moments of the superposition @xmath247\\,\\ ] ] indeed lead to all moment triples located on the line segment , @xmath248\\,\\ ] ] since the matrix elements of the second moments between states of different parity vanish .",
    "finally , any moment triple @xmath241 off the @xmath219-axis will lie on a hyperboloid with a specific value of @xmath249 , for example .",
    "this moment triple can be obtained , however , from the state @xmath250 , with a suitable value @xmath251 . using relativistic terminology ,",

    "thus , mixed states do not give rise to candidates for minima different from those associated with pure  states .",
    "consider a state @xmath253 giving rise to the moment vector @xmath254 _ inside _ the uncertainty region .",
    "it is possible to identify infinitely many pairs of gaussian states on the boundary such that their mixture reproduces the given triple @xmath255 . _ _    on the level of moments , it is geometrically obvious that any moment triple @xmath255 can be reached as a  convex combination of two points located on the boundary ( cf .",
