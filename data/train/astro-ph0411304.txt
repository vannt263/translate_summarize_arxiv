    "the compact elliptical galaxy m32 has been widely used in the past as template for the study of stellar populations and chemical evolution of elliptical galaxies ( e.g@xmath9 freedman 1992 and references therein ) .",
    "it is very nearby ( 780kpc ; tonry 1991 ; freedman & madore 1990 ) .",
    "it has very high surface brightness at optical wavelengths and it is of high metallicity ( @xmath80.2@xmath7[fe / h]@xmath7@xmath50.01 ; grillmair et al@xmath9 1996 ) .    however , the initial study of the uv properties of this galaxy by oconnell et al@xmath9 ( 1992 ) and more recently by ohl et al@xmath9 ( 1998 ) cast some doubt on m32 as being a truly typical example of an elliptical galaxy .",
    "these authors , using data from the shuttle - borne ultraviolet imaging telescope ( uit ) , claimed the presence of a strong fuv - optical color gradient in m32 , but inverted with respect to the gradients observed in the vast majority of elliptical galaxies . while in regular , luminous elliptical galaxies the inner regions are slightly bluer than the outer parts ( probably suggesting a stronger uv - upturn in the nuclear regions ) , for m32 these authors reported the opposite : a very strong blue trend ( @xmath03mag within the effective radius ; @xmath10 ) toward outer regions of the galaxy .",
    "newly obtained galex fuv observations now show that the fuv - optical gradient in m32 ( @xmath1(@xmath2@xmath3)/@xmath1@xmath4(r)=@xmath50.15@xmath60.03 ) is in fact very similar to the gradients commonly measured in luminous elliptical galaxies .",
    "this analysis rests on a careful subtraction of the background emission from the disk of m31 ( see e.g@xmath9 choi , guhathakurta , & johnston 2002 ) .",
    "we suggest that the strong negative gradient reported by ohl et al@xmath9 ( 1998 ) may have been caused by problems in the density - to - flux calibration of uit photographic data at low surface - brightness levels .",
    "galex has recently completed a mosaic image of the entire andromeda galaxy .",
    "this mosaic includes observations of the compact elliptical galaxy m32 with exposure times of 6138 seconds in the fuv band ( @xmath11=1530 ) and 4808 seconds in the nuv band ( @xmath11=2310 ) .",
    "the final spatial resolution ( fwhm ) of the combined images of m32 used in this letter was 6.0  and 6.8  for the fuv and for the nuv .",
    "the images were flux calibrated using the galex zero points ( morrissey et al@xmath9 2004 ) .    in figures",
    "[ fig1]a & [ fig1]b we show a 25@xmath1225  section of the galex fuv and nuv images centered on m32 .",
    "it is evident from these figures that significant fuv and nuv emission from the disk of m31 seriously affects m32 and that it is complex with a steep nw - se gradient .",
    "the average fuv ( nuv ) background associated with the disk of m31 that we measure close to the position of m32 is 26.0 ( 25.7 ) magarcsec@xmath13 , while the background observed far from the disk of m31 is much lower , 27.2 ( 26.7 ) magarcsec@xmath13 .",
    "therefore , if we want to derive reliable surface photometry for m32 , detailed modeling of the m31 disk emission is required .    finally , we complemented our galex observations with archival @xmath14 data obtained with the stis fuv mama ( g0 9053 ; pi : t.m@xmath9 brown ) .",
    "the @xmath14 image allows us to analyze the innermost 16  ( in radius ) of m32 at high spatial resolution ( @xmath70.1 ) .",
    "the morphology of the disk of m31 both in the fuv and nuv is very clumpy ( see figures  [ fig1]a & [ fig1]b ) , mostly due to the distinct contribution of ob associations and hii regions .",
    "this makes the modelling of the disk more complicated than at optical wavelengths where the light distribution is significantly smoother and can be reasonably well reproduced by an exponential disk ( peletier 1993 ; choi et al@xmath9 2002 ) .",
    "the subtraction of the disk of m31 was carried out in two steps .",
    "first , we removed the unresolved , diffuse background component . for the purpose of modeling this background component we masked all the individual clusters , associations , field stars , and m32 itself",
    "then , we divided the image into boxes of 75@xmath1275  and fitted a low - order polynomial to the remaining ( un - masked ) pixels using the iraf task surfit .",
    "we then subtracted the fitted background from the images and added the mean value of the modelled sky .    in the second step of subtracting the m31 disk",
    ", we removed the point - sources contribution by modelling the psf of the galex images using the iraf task psf .",
    "we then subtracted the point sources previously identified by daofind using the task substar .    the final result from the subtraction of both the unresolved background and point sources",
    "is shown in figures  [ fig1]c & [ fig1]d for the fuv and nuv images , respectively .",
    "a few point sources in the outer regions of the halo of m32 and residuals from the point - source subtraction were further masked in order to derive the surface brightness and color profiles of m32 .      to compute the fuv and nuv surface brightness profiles of m32 we used isophotal parameters derived by both peletier ( 1993 ) and choi et al@xmath9 ( 2002 ) at optical wavelengths .",
    "this allowed us to directly compare our uv surface photometry with that derived in the optical and obtain self - consistent uv - optical color profiles .",
    "note that in both of the above papers the contamination from the disk of m31 was explicitly accounted for . for sake of comparison",
    "we also fitted isophotes to our final nuv image using the iterative method of jedrzejewski ( 1987 ) .",
    "we found very small differences both in ellipticity ( @xmath80.04@xmath60.04 ) and position angle ( 2@xmath66@xmath15 ) between our best - fitting isophotes and those of peletier ( 1993 ) .    in figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "we show the fuv and nuv surface brightness profiles ( in ab magnitudes ) obtained from galex observations .",
    "the equivalent isophotal radius in this plot is computed as @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath3-band and uit fuv surface brightness profiles published by peletier ( 1993 ) and ohl et al@xmath9 ( 1998 ) , respectively , are also plotted for comparison .",
    "the best - fitting srsic - law indices of the fuv and nuv surface brightness profiles shown in figure  [ fig2 ] are 0.38@xmath60.01 and 0.26@xmath60.01 , respectively .",
    "these values are very similar to what is expected for a pure de vaucouleurs profile ( 0.25 ) .",
    "note that our uv observations do not reach the larger galactocentric distances where graham ( 2002 ) reported the presence of an extended exponential disk .",
    "for the innermost regions of the fuv surface brightness profile of m32 we have used an archival @xmath14-stis image .",
    "the background was estimated by matching the outermost part of the @xmath14 profile ( obtained using ground - based optical isophotal parameters ) with the galex fuv profile ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) .    as seen in figure  [ fig3]a",
    "all the color gradients obtained are rather flat within an @xmath10 ( 32 ; e.g@xmath9 choi et al@xmath9 2002 ) .",
    "optical data used in this plot come from peletier ( 1993 ) ; however almost identical results are obtained if data from choi et al@xmath9 ( 2002 ) are used .",
    "it is noteworthy that this behavior is observed even at distances as close to the galaxy center as 2 , below which atmospheric seeing starts to affect ground - based optical photometry ( see figure  [ fig3]b ) .",
    "a least - squares fit to the ( @xmath2@xmath3 ) color profile between 6  ( fwhm ) and 32  ( @xmath10 ) in radius yields a color gradient of @xmath1(@xmath2@xmath3)/@xmath1@xmath4(r)=@xmath50.15@xmath60.03 ( see figure  [ fig3]b ) .",
    "this value is similar to that obtained by ohl et al@xmath9 ( 1998 ) for luminous elliptical galaxies ( @xmath50.5@xmath60.3 ) , but it is very different from that obtained for m32 by ohl et al@xmath9 ( 1998 ) ( @xmath1(@xmath2@xmath3)/@xmath1@xmath4(r)@xmath7@xmath82 ) .",
    "first , we checked whether the difference found arises from the uit surface photometry obtained by ohl et al@xmath9 ( 1998 ) being significantly affected by the emission of the disk of m31 . to check this",
    "we derived the same ( @xmath2@xmath3 ) color gradient using the background subtraction procedure described above on the archival astro-1 ( b1 filter ; @xmath17=1520 ) fuv uit image .",
    "the color profile obtained is remarkably similar to that obtained by ohl et al@xmath9 ( 1998 ) ( see figure  [ fig3]b ) after being offset to match the astro-2 ( b5 filter ; @xmath17=1615 ) fuv uit photometry .",
    "we also studied the effects of the wings of the uit psf on the ( @xmath2@xmath3 ) profile .",
    "the maximum impact of this effect on the ( @xmath2@xmath3 ) color gradient is found to be @xmath180.4mag within the central 30 .",
    "the other possibility is that this difference may be a problem in the density - to - flux calibration of the ( photographic ) uit image at very low surface - brightness levels .",
    "however , a detailed study of the linearity of the uit data is beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "the galex ( @xmath2@xmath19 ) color gradient ( also sensitive to the strength of the uv - upturn ) is similar to that derived for ( @xmath2@xmath3 ) .",
    "this confirms that the color gradient derived is real and not an artifact introduced by the different background - subtraction technique or because of spatial resolution differences between the uv and optical data .",
    "this is confirmed by the analysis of the archival @xmath14-stis data , which shows a gradient at the innermost regions of the galaxy similar to and extending that obtained from galex observations alone ( see figure  [ fig3]b ) .    despite its very shallow uv - upturn , which in principle could be explained by emission from post - agb stars , brown et al@xmath9 ( 2000 ) have shown that the uv emission in m32 is dominated by hot hb stars . by analogy , this suggests that hot hb stars are also responsible for most of the fuv emission associated with the uv - upturn observed in luminous elliptical galaxies ( see brown et al@xmath9 1997 ) .",
    "the ( @xmath2@xmath3 ) color gradient reported in this letter , similar to that measured in luminous elliptical galaxies , along with the results of brown et al@xmath9 ( 2000 ) suggest that the properties and spatial distribution of the hot hb stars in m32 are the same as those in luminous elliptical galaxies . the great advantage here being that m32 is the only object where individual hot - hb stars have actually been resolved .",
    "burstein et al@xmath9 ( 1988 ) claimed that elliptical galaxies with larger mg@xmath20 indices show stronger uv - upturns .",
    "this has been interpreted as resulting from a dependence of mass - loss efficiency and helium abundance on metallicity ( greggio & renzini 1990 ; oconnell 1999 ) . however",
    ", rich et al@xmath9 ( 2004 ) , using a large sample of low - redshift red galaxies , do not find any correlation between the strength of the uv - upturn and the mg@xmath20 , d4000 , h@xmath21 indices or the velocity dispersion ( see also deharveng , boselli , & donas 2002 ) .",
    "ohl et al@xmath9 ( 1998 ) also reported a lack of correlation between the ( @xmath2@xmath3 ) gradient and the mg@xmath20-index gradient .",
    "these results suggest the presence of a second parameter ( decoupling from the fe - peak , helium abundance , age ; oconnell 1999 ) that could have an impact even stronger than the metallicity on the evolution of the uv - upturn .    the suggested presence of a strong negative gradient in ( @xmath2@xmath3 ) color in m32 ( ohl et al@xmath9 1998 ) , where the existence of an intermediate age stellar population ( spatially segregated toward the galaxy center ) has been frequently proposed ( grillmair et al@xmath9 1996 ) , had been claimed as an indication that the age may play a significant role in the evolution of the uv - upturn .",
    "however , our results in combination with the lack of structure in the optical - colors and spectroscopic - index maps of m32 ( e.g@xmath9 del burgo et al@xmath9 2001 ) indicate that if this stellar population is present , it is very smoothly distributed across the body of the galaxy and that the properties of the hot hb responsible for the uv - upturn are also very similar at any position in the galaxy .",
    "the two most intriguing differences reported between the properties of m32 and those of luminous elliptical galaxies had been : ( 1 ) the presence of an intemediate - aged stellar population ( e.g@xmath9 grillmair et al@xmath9 1996 ) and ( 2 ) the large ( inverted ) ( @xmath2@xmath3 ) color measured by ohl et al@xmath9 ( 1998 ) . regarding the former problem we note that many of the spectral synthesis analyses carried out to date assume a pure red clump hb morphology , while brown et al@xmath9 ( 2000 )",
    "have identifed a large population of hot hb stars in m32 . with regard to the latter topic ,",
    "our results show that the previously reported unusual ( @xmath2@xmath3 ) color gradient does not exist and that the uv properties of m32 are very similar to those of luminous ellipticals .",
    "we conclude that , although m32 is certainly an extreme example in the sequence of elliptical galaxies in many of its properties and the possible presence of an intermediate - aged stellar population should not be ignored , it can not be considered to be a peculiar object and its use as a reference object for stellar populations synthesis is justified .    in summary , the analysis of galex fuv and nuv imaging data of the compact elliptical galaxy m32 yields very small ( positive ) ( @xmath2@xmath3 ) and ( @xmath2@xmath19 ) color gradients , comparable to values seen in luminous elliptical galaxies .",
    "this result suggests that the properties of the hot hb stars responsible for the formation of the ( very weak ) uv - upturn in m32 are not a strong function of position in the galaxy and that they are probably similar to hot hb stars in luminous elliptical galaxies .",
