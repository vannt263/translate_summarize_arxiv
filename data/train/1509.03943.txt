    "when light interacts with matter one should discriminate between two qualitatively different regimes , namely weak and strong coupling . for the first of them the spectrum of the material system remains unchanged , and light- matter interaction results in single acts of the emission and absorption of the photons . on the contrary , in the regime of strong",
    "coupling light and matter can not be anymore treated independently from each other , and hybrid half- light half matter modes appear in the system .",
    "those modes are known as polaritons . nowadays",
    "the variety of polaritonic systems is impressive and include such widely studied cases as surface plasmon polaritons @xcite and cavity polaritons @xcite . in the latter case photonic mode is coupled with excitonic transition in the quantum well , quantum wire or individual quantum dot ( qd ) .",
    "coupling between qd and photonic mode of zero dimensional cavity lies in heart of such rapidly developing branch of science as cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) .",
    "the problem is important not only because of the fundamental aspects brought forward by the interaction of material systems with photons @xcite , but also because of the potential application of cqed to quantum information processing @xcite . from the point of view of experimental realization",
    ", excitons in individual qd can be brought to strong coupling with confined electromagnetic mode provided by a pillar ( etched planar cavity ) @xcite , the defect of a photonic crystal @xcite or the whispering gallery mode of a microdisk @xcite , among others . in the regime of weak",
    "excitation such structures have demonstrated the rabi doublet in their optical spectra , which is characteristic of the mode anticrossing that marks the overcome of dissipation by the coherent exciton - photon interaction .",
    "these achievements open the way to new research area , namely investigation of the pure quantum effects originating from strong exciton - photon coupling@xcite .",
    "although the system exhibits strong coupling , it is usually not known in which quantum state it is actually realized . to be useful for quantum information applications",
    ", one should be able to manipulate not just mean number of the particles in the system , but have a tool to monitor and control their statistics . in this context , the possibility to create the states different from essentially classical coherent and thermal states is highly desirable . if the energy of the system scales linearly with the number of particles , it is essentially classical , @xcite and adding or removing a single particle will not change its behaviour",
    ". therefore , the analysis of the nonlinear effects is highly desirable .",
    "with qds in microcavities , two types of strong nonlinearities are expected , both associated with the excitons @xcite .",
    "the first one comes from pauli exclusion , that arises from the fermionic character of the particles forming an exciton .",
    "it becomes extremely important for the case of the small size qds where , similar to individual atoms , the excitation of more then one exciton becomes impossible .",
    "pauli blocking leads to the radical transformation of the spectrum of the system , which changes from the rabi doublet to mollow triplet when the intensity of the external pump is increased @xcite .",
    "the second is coulomb repulsion between the excitons , again arising from their composite nature .",
    "this mechanism is important for the case of the excitons in the qws and large qds . in the former case it leads to the blueshift of the polaritonic modes increasing with the intensity of the external pump- the effect which can be satisfactory described within the frameworks of the mean- field approximation .",
    "the case of an individual large qd inside the cavity is , however , more tricky .",
    "coulomb repulsion between the excitons in this configuration leads to the emergence of rich multiplet structure in the emission spectrum @xcite , which reveals the pure quantum nature of light- matter coupling .    in the present paper",
    "we analyze further the essentially quantum effects arising from nonlinearities in coupled qd- cavity system .",
    "the novelty of our scheme stems from the idea that quantum systems can display qualitatively new forms of behavior when driven by fast time - periodic modulations .",
    "particularly , the application of a sequence of tailored pulses as well as time - modulated cw field leads to improving the degree of quantum effects in open cavity nonlinear systems and onset of qualitatively new quantum effects .",
    "this approach was recently exploited for the formation of a high degree continuous - variable entanglement in the nondegenerate optical parametric oscillator @xcite , for generation of fock states in kerr nonlinear resonator ( knr ) driven by a sequence of gaussian pulses @xcite and for demonstration of multiphoton blockades in pulsed regimes of dissipative knr beyond stationary limits @xcite .",
    "it has also demonstrated that amplitude modulation can improve the performance of single photon sources based on quantum dot @xcite .",
    "the idea to enrich quantum physical systems by designing a time modulation has been explored in several other fields of research including periodically driven nonlinear oscillator @xcite and periodically driven quantum matter @xcite .",
    "here we focus on consideration of cavity modes in the regimes of strong exciton - photon coupling and strong exciton - exciton interaction with respect to the rates of damping of the photonic- and exciton - modes . in these regimes the transition frequencies between energy levels of the systems without any interaction with external field are differently spaced in the quantum regime .",
    "thus , we enable spectroscopic identification and selective excitation of transitions between combined exciton - photon number states . this consideration provides the framework of master equation and the numerical method of quantum trajectories on the base of excitation numbers , @xmath1 mandel parameter or the second - order correlation function .",
    "we focus also on the wigner functions of exciton and photonic modes that allow phase - space monitoring exciton - photon coupling in quantum treatment .",
    "we show that in the presence of time - modulation the ensemble - averaged mean photon numbers , the populations of photon - number and exciton - number states , and the wigner functions are nonstationary and exhibit a periodic time dependent behavior , i.e. repeat the periodicity of the pump laser in an over transient regime .",
    "we demonstrate the possibility of the observation of purely quantum effects , namely sub - poissonian statistics of exciton- and photon - modes and the wigner functions with negative values in phase - space for time - intervals exceeding the characteristic time of dissipative processes , @xmath0 .",
    "it is shown that these results are cardinally different from the analogous results in cw regime of excitation . beside this",
    "we investigate temperature noisy effects for a cavity at finite temperatures .",
    "it leads to applications in simulating of more realistic exciton - photon systems as well as to study of unusual quantum phenomena connecting quantum engineering and temperature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the effective hamiltonian for the periodically driven polariton system and describe the physical quantities of interest . in sec .",
    "iii we study time - evolution of the mean photon numbers as well as the exciton numbers , quantum statistics of excitonic and photonic modes on base of the @xmath1 mandel parameter and the second - order correlation function for zero - delay time . we analyze also the distributions of photon - number states and the phase - space properties of photon - and exciton - modes on base of the wigner functions .",
    "the effects coming from a thermal reservoir is also briefly analysed .",
    "we summarize our results in sec .",
    "the system consists of coupled fundamental photonic dot and exciton modes driven by cw field with mean frequency @xmath2 and time - modulated amplitude .",
    "the hamiltonian of driven photon - exciton system in the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) reads :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 , @xmath5 are creation and annihilation operators of the photon mode , @xmath6 , @xmath7 are creation and annihilation operators for the exciton mode , @xmath8 is the exciton - photon coupling constant , @xmath9 is the strength of exciton - exciton interaction , @xmath10 , @xmath11 are detunings between mean frequency of the driving field and the frequencies of the photonic and exciton modes . @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the components of complex amplitude of the driven field and @xmath14 is the frequency of the modulation .",
    "the case @xmath15 describes the exciton - photon cavity driven by cw monochromatic field treated within rwa .",
    "such situation can be realized also if photon - exciton system is driven by two fields with different frequencies . in this case , the hamiltonian of the system in rwa is reduced to eq .",
    "[ hamiltonianl ] with @xmath14 being the difference between frequencies of the driving fields .    in realistic systems one should necessarily take into account the dissipation , because the modes suffer from losses due to partial transmission of light through the mirrors of the photonic cavity , non - radiative decay of excitons and decoherence .",
    "we consider these effects by assuming that the interaction of driven photon - exciton system with heat reservoir gives rise to the damping rates of modes @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we trace out the reservoir degrees of freedom in the born - markov limit assuming that system and environment are uncorrelated at initial time t = 0 .",
    "this procedure leads to the master equation for the reduced density matrix in the lindblad form .",
    "the master equation within the framework of the rotating - wave approximation , in the interaction picture corresponding to the transformation @xmath18 reads as    @xmath19 + \\sum_{i=1,2,3,4}\\left ( l_{i}\\rho l_{i}^{\\dagger}-\\frac{1}{2}l_{i}^{\\dagger}l_{i}\\rho-\\frac{1}{2}\\rho l_{i}^{\\dagger } l_{i}\\right ) \\label{master},\\ ] ]    where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23are the lindblad operators , @xmath24 is a dissipation rate , and @xmath25 denotes the mean number of quanta of a heat bath . here , for simplicity",
    "we assume that the decay rates and the mean numbers of quanta of a heat bath are equal for the both modes , @xmath26 .",
    "we analyze the mean values of excitation numbers as well as we probe the strength of quantum fluctuations of exciton and photonic modes via the mandel factor and the normally ordered second- order correlation functions of the photon numbers and excitation numbers . beside this",
    "we monitor phase properties of both modes by the wigner function .",
    "these quantities of interest are calculated by using the reduced density operators of the photons @xmath27 and of the excitons @xmath28 .",
    "these operators are constructed from the full density operator of the system @xmath29 by tracing out the excitonic or photonic modes respectively , @xmath30 for the system under time modulated external pumping the ensemble - averaged mean oscillatory excitation numbers as well as the other physical quantities exhibit a periodic time - dependent behavior after initial transient time interval . using the master equation above",
    "we calculate the time - evolution of the @xmath1 mandel factor for the photonic and exciton modes . for photonic mode",
    "it is defined as @xmath31 where @xmath32 describes the deviation of the excitation number uncertainty from the poissonian variance , @xmath33 .",
    "the case @xmath34 corresponds to poissonian statistics . if @xmath35 , the statistics is super - poissonian , if @xmath36 it is sub - poissonian , and analogous for the exciton mode .",
    "the mandel factor is connected with the normalized second - order correlation function for zero delay time @xmath37 defined ( for the photonic mode ) as : @xmath38 for a short counting time - intervals the approximate relation between these quantities reads as @xmath39 .",
    "thus , the condition @xmath40 corresponds to the sub - poissonian statistics , @xmath41 .",
    "we analyze the master equation numerically using well known quantum state diffusion method @xcite . according to this method",
    ", the reduced density operator is calculated as the ensemble mean over the stochastic states describing evolution along a quantum trajectory .",
    "it should be mentioned that exciton - photon system is actually presented as the model of driving coupled oscillators with anharmonic term .",
    "such model has been focus of considerable attention and this interest is justified by many applications in different contexts .",
    "particularly , in field of quantum devices for a few - photon level one application concerns to realization of strong photon blockade in photonic molecules with modest kerr - nonlinearity of the photon using two coupled photonic cavities @xcite .",
    "in our further consideration we concentrate on analysis of coupled exciton - photon in quantum regimes at low level of quanta .",
    "this analysis is performed by using the following set of dimensionless parameters @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , as well as parameters of amplitude modulation @xmath45 , @xmath46 and the frequency of modulation @xmath14 .",
    "let us discuss the operational regimes in more details . if energy levels of the coupled exciton- photon states are well resolved we can consider near to the resonant selective transitions between lower photon - exciton states .",
    "in this way , the detunings play an important role when identifying the spectral lines , thus we arrange the detunings of modes to reach a qualitative quantum effects .",
    "we estimate the detuning by using the results on the structure of energy levels of a quantum dot in a microcavity in the nonlinear regimes ref . @xcite . in this paper the optical spectrum at resonance transition was studied by diagonalizing the hamiltonian [ hamiltonianl ] without the driving term . in this case",
    "the total number of excitations is conserved , and eigenstates of the total particle number @xmath47 with eigenvalue @xmath48 can be used as the @xmath48th manifold of the system . particularly , two - photon excitation of the system with @xmath49 leads to the eigenvectors that invoves triplet states @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 with photonic and exciton number states . if we neglect the exciton - exciton interaction , the energy levels form the rabi triplet @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 . in this way",
    ", two - photon resonant frequencies leading to exsitation of the level @xmath56 equals to @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the level of ground state .",
    "therefore , @xmath59 and hence the detunings @xmath60 , @xmath61 are @xmath62 . in this approach the effects of exciton - exciton interaction can be included by using numerical calculations ref .",
    "for strong driving field the detunings can be also shifted due to stark effects .",
    "thus , for the concrete calculations , later we use the approximate value of detunings corresponding to the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath43 .",
    "note , that such analysis seems to be rather qualitative than quantitative but allows us to estimate the values of detunings .",
    "indeed , considering strong analysis of the selective excitation of cavity modes we need in calculations of the other resonant frequencies corresponding the large numbers of quanta , @xmath63 .",
    "below , for concrete calculations we use the values @xmath64 that are estimated for the parameter @xmath44 = 7 .    for the illustrative purposes",
    "let us first consider the case of the non - dissipative system .",
    "the typical results for the time - evolution of the mean excitation numbers of both photon - mode and exciton - mode due to the coupling between modes and the exciton - exciton nonlinearity are shown at the figs .",
    "[ nondis ] .",
    "we assume that at @xmath65 the exciton mode is in vacuum state @xmath66 while the four - photon number state is injected into the resonator , @xmath67 . as we see , without any driving the total number of quanta is conserved and the dynamics of excitation numbers display oscillatory behaviour , where are observed the rabi transitions between the modes with collapses and revivals effects .",

    ", we obtain interesting collapses and revival effects in the simplest model as a manifestation of nonlinear exciton - exciton interaction that leads to spaced energies of exciton number states .",
    "note , also that in this case conservation of total particle numbers lead to anti - phase dynamics of mode that is violated in the presence of driving .",
    "now we turn to the realistic case where dissipation and decoherence are taken into account considering pure quantum effects for zero temperature cavity .",
    "we start from the case of @xmath13 = 0 , which corresponds to the single mode cw excitation , and the initial state corresponding to no excitations in the cavity .",
    "the typical results for the excitation numbers , the mandel parameters and the contour plots of the wigner functions of two modes are depicted in fig .",
    "[ linstat ] .",

    "the results for nonstationary correlation functions for photonic and excitonic modes versus dimensionless time intervals are depicted in fig .",
    "[ bestmandel](d ) .",
    "as we see , in this regime the results display photon anti - bunching as well as the exciton anti - bunching for all time - intervals .",
