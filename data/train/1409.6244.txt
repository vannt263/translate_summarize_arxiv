    "the investigation on how purely self  gravitating matter evolves on long time scales has played and still plays a central role in cosmology , in astrophysics and in statistical mechanics . from the statistical point of view , the main obstacle towards the establishment of a general picture is the lack of simple additivity due to the long range interaction .",
    "this prevents a system , even if composed by a macroscopic number of `` particles '' , to reach thermodynamic equilibrium , so that the usual laws of equilibrium thermodynamics do not apply @xcite .",
    "conversely , it is well known that there exist infinitely many stable equilibrium phase  space configurations to choose from as @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "still , relaxation of some sort must occur , since self  gravitating systems of many different kinds and sizes appear to be in ( quasi ) stationary states @xcite .",
    "likewise , numerical @xmath18body simulations of such systems show that , from a coarse  grained point of view , some type of equilibration does occur @xcite .",
    "the central issue is then how to properly identify the quasi  stationary states corresponding to given initial conditions . as detailed below , such identification is the aim of this work in the specific case of single warm dark matter ( wdm ) halos , although the implications of our findings probably extend to wider domains .    indeed , in the cosmological context , important questions concern the properties of dm halos , which are the cradles of galaxy formation @xcite . in turn , the halos are formed through gravitational collapse triggered by tiny perturbations over the uniform dm background which dominates the total matter contribution @xmath19 to the energy density of the universe ( baryons contributing only a smaller fraction @xmath20 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the counting and the properties of galaxies with any given mass should be traced back to the primordial power spectrum of dm perturbations , which statistically determines the initial conditions , and to the quasi  stationary state ( or states ) to which gravity drives the various local matter overdensities .",
    "for example , in a universe dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) the density perturbations are gravitationally unstable down to mass scales much smaller than those of galaxies and extensive numerical simulations ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite and references therein ) have shown that structure formation proceeds bottom  up with the early collapse of very small regions , followed by larger and larger ones , with a complex merging histories that produce successively more or less relaxed objects of increasing mass , like dwarf satellites , massive galaxies , groups and clusters .",
    "thus the properties of a single dm halo depend on the full history of a much larger region of comoving space , hindering a clear  cut analytic modeling of its quasi  stationary state .",
    "however , this cdm scenario has ( at least ) two distinguishing features contradicted by observations : it exhibits an overabundance of small mass virialized halos @xcite and cuspy density profiles @xcite where observations point to cored ones @xcite .",
    "the latter problem , the so  called cusp  core puzzle of cdm , apparently fades away upon including baryon feedback in certain simulations @xcite , but not in others @xcite .    structure formation based on wdm is in principle protected against these cdm difficulties , while reproducing all the observed large scale ( @xmath21mpc ) properties as cdm does .",
    "in fact wdm is characterized by the proper amount of primordial velocity dispersion , with associated free streaming , to smooth out initial density fluctuations over scales below the mpc @xcite .",
    "this velocity dispersion should also help to better match the observed density profile of collapsed halos . in brief",
    ", wdm reconciles , or tend to reconcile with observations several small to middle scale astrophysical and cosmological features such as , for example , the halo concentration and satellite counts in @xmath18body simulations @xcite , the phase  space density of dwarf spheroids in a model",
    " independent wdm treatment @xcite , the mass function in the halo model @xcite , the galaxy luminosity functions and the stellar mass distributions in semi ",
    "analytic models @xcite .",
    "many other investigations @xcite confirm that wdm agrees with observations better than cdm .",
    "still , one observational fact that many numerical simulations on wdm fail to correctly reproduce is the size of the halo cores @xcite . indeed , a well known theoretical argument , rooted on the tremaine ",
    "gunn bound @xcite , implies that wdm halos are cored @xcite .",
    "it is based on the so  called ( pseudo ) phase  space density @xcite , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the characteristic mass density and @xmath24 the characteristic one  dimensional velocity dispersion of the core",
    ". one can argue @xcite ( see @xcite for more punctual analysis that however do not alter significantly the conclusions ) that @xmath25 , where the space ",
    "constant @xmath26 is computed at wdm decoupling , in any given particle model .",
    "then , _ assuming _ a halo model ( _ e.g _ an isothermal sphere as in ref .  @xcite or a pseudo - isothermal one as in ref .",
    "@xcite to relate @xmath24 to @xmath23 , one obtains a bound on the core size .",
    "wdm @xmath18body simulations apparently produce cores which almost saturate this bound @xcite .",
    "the problem is that these cores are resolved , and found with size comparable to the observed ones , only for initial velocity dispersions so large that the corresponding free streaming would have erased at the linear level the fluctuation seeds of the halo themselves ( the _ catch 22 _ of ref .",
    "viceversa , using the theoretical bound to extrapolate the size of resolved cores to velocity dispersions small enough to allow the fluctuation seeds , yields cores two order of magnitude smaller than the observed ones .",
    "if this were indeed the situation , wdm structure formation would need help from baryon feedback ( if that really can help ) almost as badly as cdm does .",
    "alternatively , in could be that current @xmath18body simulations , plus extrapolations based on equilibrium assumptions , do not provide a quantitatively sound description of wdm gravitational collapse below the kpc scale .",
    "here we address the second possibility only and give an affirmative answer , by showing that wdm is an effective working hypothesis for explaining the size of observed dm cores .    in this work ,",
    "we report the results of extensive high  resolution direct numerical integrations of the spherically symmetric vlasov  poisson equation for a @xmath27kev wdm thermal relic .",
    "the vlasov  poisson equation ( [ eq : vp ] ) , often called collisionless boltzmann  poisson equation , describes the non  dissipative incompressible @xmath28dimensional phase ",
    "space flow of self  gravitating continuous matter .",
    "it is what @xmath18body simulations attempt to approximately solve with fictitious particles moving in @xmath29dimensional configuration space .    our findings , outlined in the next subsection and described in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , provide an overall picture of wdm halo cores quite different from the commonly expected one , which is based on some apriori assumptions and the ( extrapolation of the ) results of @xmath18body simulations .",
    "a common expectation about cored dm halos , as those of wdm , is that their mass density is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath30 which has some core radius @xmath4 as unique length scale in the core region .",
    "this is indeed the situation in collisionless self  gravitating systems at equilibrium , that are described by stationary and stable ergodic phase ",
    "space distributions @xcite .",
    "the above expectation is then extended to quasi  stationary states , with the understanding that they do not differ much from truly equilibrium states .",
    "the property that should guarantee this proximity is core virialization , which can be described as follows .",
    "let us consider a spherical , purely self  gravitating system .",
    "thanks to gauss law , one can unambiguously compute the gravitational potential energy @xmath31 within the sphere of radius @xmath30 , regardless of the system configuration for @xmath32 .",
    "hence one can define the @xmath33dependent virial ratio @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the kinetic energy within the sphere .",
    "suppose the system has relaxed to some quasi  stationary state with a core of size @xmath4 .",
    "for @xmath30 large enough we expect virialization , that is @xmath36 .",
    "for @xmath37 instead , we have @xmath38 , since @xmath39 while @xmath40 as @xmath41 in a core that is in hydrostatic equilibrium . in between @xmath42",
    "will decrease in some system  specific way .",
    "if @xmath43 for @xmath44 , we can say that also the core is virialized .",
    "since @xmath4 is the only scale in the core region , also @xmath42 is a function only of @xmath45 , which behaves as @xmath46 for @xmath47 small enough and monotonically decreases in the interval @xmath48 .",
    "this is exactly what happens for instance in the isothermal sphere and many other systems with ergodic phase ",
    "space distributions .",
    "cdm halos do not have cores but are quite virialized , so they have only the system  specific decrease . for example , if we rather crudely assume @xmath49 _  la _ nfw @xcite and @xmath50 @xcite , then @xmath51 , in any case much slower than within a core .",
    "wdm halos are cored and the @xmath52 region can be theoretically and/or numerically investigated , provided the resolution is high enough . according to the common lore just described , the inner part of a halo should be in some quasi  stationary state not too different from stable equilibrium states .",
    "the halo core would then be virialized in the sense defined above .",
    "on the contrary , the main result of our investigation can be stated as follow : _ the spherical collapse of wdm yields cores that are hollow and not virialized_.    details are provided in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : sixp ] , [ fig : rho ] and [ fig : w ] in particular ) .",
    "here we just make few simple observations to support these numerical findings .",
    "let us assume for the moment that the inner part of the halo can indeed be modeled by some equilibrium  type cored configuration .",
    "then for @xmath53 we have @xmath54 , where @xmath4 is in the kpc scale to match , for instance , the dm halos of dwarf galaxies .",
    "consider now the uniform isotropic universe at some time @xmath55 when the energy contribution of matter inhomogeneities is negligible and choose , in order to evaluate the initial value @xmath56 of the virial ratio , the center of a future collapse ( of what type of dm does not matter yet ) as origin of the comoving coordinates .",
    "the result is ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : w ] for details on the elementary derivation ) : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the scale factor , @xmath59 is the hubble parameter and @xmath60 is the dm ( comoving ) velocity dispersion . in the derivation we assumed that dm is non  relativistic at the time @xmath61 considered .    in the case of cdm , we have @xmath62 and the gravitational collapse will need to reduce the nearly constant @xmath63 by just a factor @xmath64 to virialize the halo . instead , in the case of wdm particles , that decouple while ultra ",
    "relativistic but are already non  relativistic deep in the rd era , we obtain @xmath65 where we used @xmath66 , with @xmath67 the radiation fraction at time @xmath55 , to recognize in @xmath68 a ( very crude ) estimation of the free  streaming length of the wdm particles .",
    "therefore @xmath69 indeed , by construction @xmath70 .",
    "for instance , thermal relics with a mass of @xmath27kev/@xmath1 ( and two internal degrees of freedom ) have @xmath71km / s , so that @xmath72kpc since @xmath73 by the time only neutrinos and photons contribute to radiation .",
    "hence , throughout the region of the future core , kinetic energy initially exceeds by three orders of magnitudes the typical value it would eventually have in a few kpc virialized core . and the smaller the core , the higher the kinetic energy excess , since @xmath68 is fixed way before the collapse started .",
    "of course this is an idealized scenario , since the real collapse will not be spherical , there could be mergers and so on .",
    "but the free streaming of a kev - sized wdm has also the merit of smoothing out the matter fluctuations on scales of several hundreds kpc .",
    "then the possibility of a nearly spherical and almost undisturbed collapse is certainly not a far  fetched idealization as it would be for cdm .",
    "hence the kinetic energy excess in the initial conditions w.r.t .",
    "the virialized core after the collapse holds beyond the approximation of spherical symmetry .    during the collapse , phase mixing and violent relaxation @xcite alone might still bring the system to a quasi  stationary state but , lacking more efficient energy transfer mechanisms such as radiation or dissipation , they need not be able to reduce the virial ratio by the thousands in the finite amount of time available .",
    "this is just what we observe by numerically integrating the vlasov ",
    "poisson equation .",
    "a complementary viewpoint is based on the conservation of angular momentum , which is the same in physical and comoving coordinates . in a spherically symmetric system",
    ", the @xmath74particle angular momentum is conserved also if the potential is not constant .",
    "of course , the mean vector angular momentum vanishes by symmetry , but the squared angular momentum @xmath75 does not .",
    "matter which is initially at a distance @xmath76 but will eventually fall in the core , has a conserved @xmath75 of order @xmath77 . like the skate dancer that closes her arms",
    ", this matter will spin faster in the core , sustaining the original excess of core kinetic energy .    the net result we observe and describe in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , is the formation of halos with a hollow core , that is with a non monotonically decreasing mass density which develops its maximum @xmath78 at some @xmath79 , which provides a first natural definition of core radius . throughout the core and beyond a large excess of kinetic energy is trapped mostly in tangential motions .",
    "the core is approaching a dynamic rather than hydrostatic equilibrium and the mass density @xmath80 features a roughly parabolic rise till @xmath81 , where @xmath78 is almost three order of magnitude larger than the density deep into the core . for @xmath82 , @xmath80 quite rapidly settles to the @xmath83 decrease that implies a constant circular velocity .",
    "clearly the crossover at @xmath84 provides another length scale beside @xmath81 .",
    "we find that these properties are common to all the 111 halos of our sample .",
    "the halos are obtained starting from different initial overdensity profiles , which are in turn constructed , according to the procedure described in sec .",
    "[ sec : sphinit ] , by angle averaging over the peaks of a random realization of the fluctuation field proper of a @xmath27kev wdm thermal relic .",
    "the overall shape of @xmath80 is almost independent of the initial conditions and of the location or value of the maximum itself ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : sixp ] , [ fig : rho ] and [ fig : highres ] ) .",
    "these latter quantities instead , which fix the overall scale of @xmath80 , do depend on the details of the the initial fluctuation profile , such as height and size .",
    "the hollow core shape allows a natural definition of the core radius @xmath4 and the core density @xmath5 slightly different from @xmath85 : the pair @xmath86 define the point where the density @xmath80 should be cut to replace the hollow core with a constant density core ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : rc ] ) .",
    "@xmath87 is therefore slightly larger than @xmath81 .    in our sample",
    "we find values of @xmath4 ranging from @xmath2 to @xmath3kpc and values of @xmath5 ranging from @xmath88 to @xmath89pc@xmath90 . very interestingly , the core radius @xmath4 is nearly inversely proportional to the core density @xmath5 leading to an nearly constant value of @xmath91 around @xmath92pc@xmath9 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : rc ] for more details ) , in remarkable agreement with the observations reported in refs .",
    "however , while the near constancy of @xmath93 could be rooted in the core hollowness ( a constant surface density means a constant core mass per unit area , a property certainly more appropriate to hollow cores than to bulky ones ) , the quantitative proximity to the observational value @xmath94/pc@xmath9 is rather puzzling ( and quite intriguing ) , since the estimation of @xmath95 is based on the hypothesis that the dm density has a bulky burkert profile @xcite , with its own definition of core radius @xmath96 and core density @xmath97 .",
    "when a burkert fit is performed on the hollow cores for @xmath98 ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : rc ] for the details ) , one obtains values of @xmath99 around @xmath100pc@xmath9 , roughly four times larger than @xmath95 .",
    "the typical @xmath4 we find is more than one order of magnitude larger than what expected for a wdm particle of mass @xmath0kev/@xmath1 according to the @xmath101based theoretical bound and extrapolations from resolved cores of @xmath18body simulations @xcite . but this type of arguments rely on the apriori assumption of a _",
    "thermalized _ , and _ a fortiori _ virialized , core and therefore is not applicable to the wdm cores found in our simulations .",
    "see sec .",
    "[ sec : rc ] for the explicit comparison of the hollow core with that of the isothermal sphere , which shows in detail how the isothermal extrapolation fails ; see sec .",
    "[ sec : sigma ] for our technical explanation of why it fails .    on the other hand , at odd with @xmath18body simulations , our halos feature a diffuse part with a @xmath83 tail which is too long .",
    "the density is still decreasing almost as slowly as @xmath83 where it tales values from 100 to 200 times larger than the critical density .",
    "one possible cause is a bias in our construction of spherically symmetric overdensity profiles for the initial conditions ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : sphinit ] ) , which does not allow enough matter outflow from the collapsing halo .",
    "this makes it awkward to build a reliable @xmath87 _ vs. _ @xmath102 relation , for any common definition of halo mass @xmath103 .",
    "hence , as in observations , the best way to quantify the mass content of a halo is to consider the maximal circular velocity @xmath6 . in our sample",
    "we find that @xmath104 takes values between @xmath105 to @xmath106km / s , characteristic of small disk galaxies , whereas @xmath4 and @xmath5 are typical of dwarf spheroids .",
    "this concentration excess is properly measured by means of the burkert fit for @xmath107 .",
    "we find that @xmath108 is roughly twice @xmath4 , while @xmath109 , the maximal circular velocity of the burkert fit , is always very close to @xmath6 .",
    "hence , apart from the mass deficit of the hollow core w.r.t .",
    "the burkert core for @xmath110 , our halos differ from realistic dm halo only because the surface density @xmath11 is four times larger than the observed value . in other words , the region @xmath111 of our hollow ",
    "core halos is more concentrated than real dm halos by a factor roughly equal to @xmath112 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sigma ] we estimate that this factor grows to @xmath113 when the mass of the wdm particle is raised up to @xmath114kev@xmath115 , the value that now seems most favored @xcite , and reaches @xmath116 when @xmath117kev@xmath115 , the lower bound from lyman@xmath118 and hydrodynamical simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this quantitative analysis is the least restrictive , since the burkert fit is performed only for @xmath119 , the only region of the inner halo where the fit can be accurate .",
    "since the bulky burkert profile provides a very good fit to real dm halos down to few percents of @xmath96 , the hollow core is most likely ruled out observations .",
    "hence whatever improvement , modification and/or enhancement that might succeed in reducing @xmath11 should also eliminate , or strongly reduce , the hollowness . an obvious addition could be baryons , completely neglected in the zeroth order approach of this work and possible hollowness  reducer thorough adiabatic compression .",
    "another could be quantum corrections , to be briefly motivated in the next section .    at any rate , since we find cores with an inner mass deficit rather than excess , with a surface density nearly constant and relatively close to the observed value , the starting point provided by our vp approach appears by far better than in cdm  only @xmath18body simulations or in the too - small  core wdm simulations cited above .    in the next section we outline some improvements for our wdm - only vp simulations and we also question the soundness of another common apriori assumption on dm dynamics .",
    "the first , obvious and major improvement would be to go beyond the approximation of spherically symmetric collapse and tackle the full @xmath28dimensional vlasov  poisson problem . a promising low  resolution attempt in this direction is reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the computational resources required for a high  resolution cosmological simulation appear at the moment prohibitively large , at least for the author . moreover , it is very unlikely that the problem @xmath120 is entirely due to the approximation of spherical symmetry .",
    "remaining in the more tractable framework of spherical symmetry , we can consider a few interesting directions for future improvement :    1 .",
    "a problematic aspect of our halo sample is the small variation of the basic parameters @xmath5 , @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "the most likely cause is a bias in our construction of spherically symmetric overdensity profiles for the initial conditions ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : sphinit ] ) , which does not allow enough matter outflow from the collapsing halo .",
    "a more sophisticated selection procedure could be implemented to better mimic , even within the approximation of spherical symmetry , the effects of nearby collapsing halos on the halo of interest .",
    "this could at the same time increase the parameter variations and reduce the too long @xmath83 tail of the halos .",
    "it is also conceivable that a shorter @xmath83 tail could improve the value of the surface density @xmath11 , although probably less than necessary .",
    "2 .   the large initial virial ratio and the crucial role played by angular momentum imply that the halo collapse might be sensitive to details of the freezed  out velocity distribution , which in our simulation we fixed to the simplest fermi  dirac form proper for thermal relics ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : vpdm ] ) .",
    "indeed we find that the core properties strongly depend on @xmath60 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : sigma ] .",
    "hence other wdm models , which are already known to yield different cutoff effects on the primordial power spectrum @xcite , might also lead to noticeable effects on the core properties . in this respect ,",
    "accurate analysis at the linear level also of wdm velocities , as that in ref .",
    "@xcite , could play an important quantitative role in the collapse dynamics through a better determination of the initial conditions .",
    "3 .   another common apriori assumption on dm dynamics , besides the core virialization discussed above , is that quantum effects are fully negligible .",
    "the large density variation in the hollow core , the crucial role played by angular momentum in our wdm collapse and the profound quantum modifications to the theory of angular momentum , suggest instead that quantum mechanics could have a deep role in the shaping of wdm cores , provided its effects were non negligible in the primordial universe .",
    "we elaborate this point below .",
    "the relevance of quantum mechanics for ultra  compact dwarf galaxies with wdm halos , within an equilibrium approach , was discussed already in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for a particle of mass @xmath12 ,",
    "the quantum unit of phase ",
    "space density is @xmath121 strictly speaking it should just be @xmath122 , the inverse of the volume of a quantum cell in the phase space with the conventional dimensions of ( length @xmath123 momentum)@xmath90 .",
    "the extra factor of @xmath124 comes from the normalization to a mass density , rather than a number density , and to the use of velocity rather than momentum as coordinate in phase space .",
    "if @xmath125 denotes the number of non  translation degrees of freedom of the particle , such as spin and/or internal symmetry quantum numbers , it follows that ( notice the @xmath126 difference w.r.t .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the characteristic de broglie wavelength and @xmath129 is the mean interparticle distance .",
    "thus @xmath130 provides a semiclassical measure of how much particles in a non  relativistic gas with density @xmath23 and velocity dispersion @xmath24 are packed w.r.t .",
    "the reference quantum packing fixed by heisenberg s indetermination principle .",
    "values @xmath131 of @xmath130 then indicate that quantum effects could be important , as in the standard non  relativistic free fermi gas .    since @xmath132 largely decreases during the classical gravitational collapse ( we verified this also in our simulations , see sec .  [",
    "sec : phiq ] ) , we have to compare it with @xmath133 at the beginning , when wdm is already non ",
    "relativistic but still nearly homogeneous . for thermal relics",
    "the issue is solved in the simplest possible way , since in that case the primordial value of @xmath130 is a pure number that does not depend on cosmological parameters nor on the actual value of the mass : @xcite : @xmath134 thus the classical framework might not be fully adequate for wdm , after all .",
    "if so , also the history before should be revisited to determine more appropriate initial conditions with the necessary quantum corrections , namely , the classical framework ignores from the start the fermionic quantum pressure which , in view of the above value of @xmath26 , could significantly contrast the gravitational pull and flatten the halo cores , as advocated in refs .  @xcite .",
    "in the mean  field approximation , the phase ",
    "space one  particle distribution function @xmath135 of a purely self  gravitating system of @xmath136 identical particles evolves according to the vlasov ",
    "poisson ( vp ) equation @xmath137 f = 0\\;,\\\\      & \\nabla_r^2\\phi = 4\\pi g\\,\\rho \\;,\\quad \\rho({{{\\boldsymbol{r}}}},t ) = \\int      d^3v\\,f({{{\\boldsymbol{r}}}},{{{\\boldsymbol{v}}}},t)\\;.    \\end{split}\\ ] ] here @xmath23 represent the mass density of the system , obviously normalized as @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the particle mass . strictly speaking then , it is @xmath140 that plays the role of one  particle distribution function .",
    "field approximation means that two  body or higher correlation functions are considered always negligible .",
    "then the specific value @xmath12 of the particle mass drops completely out of the game if @xmath141 is normalized as in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vp ] ) , which now describe the evolution of a non  dissipative incompressible fluid in phase space subject only to the self  consistent gravitational force it generates .",
    "in fact , the first equation in ( [ eq : vp ] ) is nothing but liouville s equation for free streaming in the `` external '' field @xmath142 .    it is commonly believed ( and in a certain special sense rigorously demonstrated @xcite ) that in the limit @xmath143 the mean  field description becomes exact . but from the more practical point of view of understanding the dynamics of the @xmath144 ( or more ) particles of a dm halo , for example , there can be little doubt that the self  gravitating fluid description implied by the mean  field approximation is more accurate than any @xmath145body dynamics with @xmath146 at least @xmath147 times smaller than @xmath136 and simulation `` particles '' as massive as @xmath148 gev/@xmath1 . due to",
    "the absence of dissipative phenomena in the collisionless mean  field dynamics , it is legitimate to have doubts also on the hydrodynamic approximations to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vp ] ) , where the moment expansion in velocity space is closed at second order by some heuristic equation of state .",
    "the problem , from a numerical point of view , is that simulations of the six  dimensional continuous system eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vp ] ) , without any symmetry to help , are much more demanding than @xmath145body or @xmath29dimensional hydrodynamical simulations .    since the vlasov equation is formally time ",
    "reversible , the system retains full memory of its initial conditions , albeit dispersed on smaller and smaller scales over phase space .",
    "it is commonly believed that any reasonably coarse  grained version of the exact solution @xmath135 does relax to some form of equilibrium , or quasi  stationary states ( qss ) , a typical feature of systems with long - range interactions .",
    "bell theory of violent relaxation @xcite provides a rather general framework for this , although only for very special situations it is has been possible to verify that the qss to which the system relaxes does indeed maximize the lynden  bell coarse  grained entropy @xcite .",
    "in other words , little is known on the class of initial conditions that do lead to qss , or , if the system does relax to qss , on the map from the space of initial conditions to the space of qss and on the relative time scales .",
    "however , this fact is not a major issue in the cosmological applications of the vp equation , since the initial conditions in the linear regime of the gravitational clustering are rather well known .",
    "then the real problem is to solve as accurately as possible the vp equation and see what really happens in the finite cosmic time available , regardless of any assumed relaxation to a qss .      in the cosmological frw spacetime , well after matter - radiation equilibration , the non  relativistic dm fluid evolves according to vp system ( [ eq : vp ] ) of newtonian equations , with @xmath149 identified with the cosmic time . but in a cosmological context one can not ignore the ( accelerated ) universe expansion even for a single dm halo .",
    "if the phase  space coordinates @xmath150 are interpreted as physical coordinates for a dm particle , then no change is needed in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vp ] ) to implement a decelerated expansion , since the latter affects only the initial conditions through the assumption of the proper hubble flow . on the other hand ,",
    "the accelerated expansion caused by the cosmological constant @xmath151 requires to introduce antigravity , by appropriately changing the source term in poisson s equation , that is @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the energy density due to @xmath151 , written in terms of the present fraction @xmath154 and of the critical density or , equivalently , of the present hubble parameter @xmath155 .",

    "this would indeed constitute a major obstacle to the whole approach if the bound on the courant number was regarded as necessary for the cfl condition to hold .    in reality , however , the bound of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cfl ] ) applies only to local updating algorithms , that is methods in which the updated value of the variable of interest in a given cell depends on the old values in the same cell and in a small , fixed number ( which depends on the specific method ) of nearby cells ( the so  called algorithm stencil ) .",
    "the bound does not apply to non  local algorithms where the stencil grows with the advection velocity .",
    "the simplest example is uniform advection in one dimension . in this case advection",
    "reduces to rigid translation ; then , if the lattice is uniform , by splitting the translation parameter into an integer multiple of the lattice spacing @xmath323 plus the fractional part , one can advect in a single step by amounts @xmath328 much larger than @xmath323 , making the courant number @xmath322 arbitrarily large . using piecewise linear reconstruction ,",

    ", we report here only the main results of three full  program tests .",
    "indeed , the advection solver was adapted from quite standard , widely tested and employed algorithms ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",

[ eq : sigma ] , the value @xmath347km / s corresponds to @xmath348kev/@xmath1 . in turns , this mass corresponds to the @xmath18body simulation wdm3 of ref .",
    "one can check that their wdm3 density profile agrees quite well with our hollow @xmath80 for @xmath349pc , on the right of the maximum .",
    "this shows that , on the common domain of validity , @xmath18body simulations and direct vp integration agree , as far as the mass density is concerned .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] and table  [ tab : sigma ] show that the overall size of the core increases with @xmath60 , as is natural to expect .",
    "maybe less obvious is the peak broadening , that progressively makes the notion of hollowness less appropriate and harder to detect with low ",
    "resolution means . in other words ,",
    "the second length scale of the hollow core , the hollowness scale , grows to values comparable to the first scale @xmath87 .",
    "notice that @xmath4 , as defined in sec  [ sec : rc ] , does not grow very much , while @xmath96 , the core radius of the burkert fit , grows almost linearly with @xmath12 . moreover",
    ", both @xmath7 and @xmath350 considerably decreases , roughly maintaining their ratio constant .    from the data in table  [",
    "tab : sigma ] we can write to a good approximation @xmath351 and @xmath352 thus , baldly extrapolating to larger values of the wdm mass , we obtain @xmath353 since @xmath94/pc@xmath9 , we see that the core of h1 would have a surface density ( or surface gravity acceleration , since the two are proportional ) roughly 6 times larger than real dm halos when @xmath354 . taking into account",
    "that this applies to pure wdm collapse ( that is with no baryon feedback of any type ) and within a purely classical approach ( probably a more relevant limitation ) , we consider this a very good starting point for the improvements outlined in the introduction .",
    "the last row in table  [ tab : sigma ] shows values of @xmath96 , @xmath11 and @xmath109 in very good agreement with observations .",

    "the value @xmath356 used in the matter power spectrum to generate the fluctuation field from which the initial profile was drawn . we can not pretend to realistically lower the surface density of one given halo by just raising @xmath60 , while keeping fixed the initial overdensity profile .",
    "larger @xmath60 implies more free  streaming in the linear regime of gravitational clustering , with the associated small  scale depression of the matter power spectrum .",
    "thus , a fluctuation profile that was generic at @xmath357km / s , could be practically impossible at @xmath347km / s .",

    "@xcite , the scaling of the core size with the mass was determined to be @xmath358 , while we find the relation ( [ eq : r0sig ] ) for the burkert core radius and an even slower decrease for @xmath4 . once extrapolated to @xmath356",
    ", the scaling @xmath359 leads to core sizes around @xmath360pc instead of several hundreds , as we find .",
    "the incorrect scaling @xmath358 can be traced to the underestimation of the relaxation factor @xmath361 , that is the overestimation of the pseudo phase ",

    "@xcite could resolve the core only for such masses and found @xmath132 in the core very close to its theoretical maximum .",
