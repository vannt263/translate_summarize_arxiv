    "the h1 and zeus detectors took first data in 1992 .",
    "the zeus detector is shown in figure  [ fig : zeus ] . the asymmetric design of the detector reflects the proton energy being significantly higher than that of the electron beam .",
    "the tracking system consists of a vertex detector ( vxd )  @xcite and a central tracking chamber ( ctd )  @xcite enclosed in a 1.43 t solenoidal magnetic field . immediately surrounding",
    "the beampipe is the vxd which consists of 120 radial cells , each with 12 sense wires .",
    "the ctd , which encloses the vxd , is a drift chamber consisting of 72  cylindrical layers , arranged in 9 superlayers .",
    "superlayers with wires parallel to the beam axis alternate with those inclined at a small angle to give a stereo view .",
    "a forward tracking detector is employed in the forward region to detect tracks in the proton direction and consists of three 12-layer planar drift chambers sandwiched with pairs of transition radiation detectors . in the rear direction",
    "there is an additional 12-layer planar drift chamber known as the rear tracking detector ( rtd ) .    outside",
    "the solenoid is the uranium - scintillator calorimeter ( cal )  @xcite , which is divided into three parts : forward , barrel and rear covering the polar regions @xmath3 to @xmath4 , @xmath4 to @xmath5 and @xmath5 to @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the cal covers 99.7@xmath7 of the solid angle , with holes of @xmath8 @xmath9 in the centres of the forward and rear calorimeters to accommodate the hera beam pipe .",
    "each of the calorimeter parts is subdivided into towers which are segmented longitudinally into electromagnetic ( emc ) and hadronic ( hac ) sections .",
    "the small angle rear tracking detector ( srtd )  @xcite , which is attached to the front face of the rear calorimeter , measures the impact point of charged particles at small angles with respect to the positron beam direction .",
    "the iron return yoke for the magnet is instrumented with proportional counters .",
    "this backing calorimeter ( bac ) measures any hadronic energy which ` leaks out ' out of the main calorimeter . beyond that and in the forward direction",

    "a fuller description of the zeus detector can be found in reference  @xcite .",
    "the h1 detector is of a very similar layout as zeus and a description can be found in reference  @xcite .",
    "the event kinematics of deep inelastic scattering , dis , are determined by the negative square of the four - momentum transfer at the positron vertex , @xmath12 , and the bjorken scaling variable , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the four - momentum of the proton . in the quark parton model ( qpm ) ,",

    "there are significant higher - order quantum chromodynamic ( qcd ) corrections : to leading order in the strong coupling constant , @xmath21 these are qcd - compton scattering ( qcdc ) , where a gluon is radiated by the scattered quark and boson - gluon - fusion ( bgf ) , where the virtual boson and a gluon fuse to form a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "both processes have 2 + 1 partons in the final state , as shown in fig .  [",

    "there also exists calculations for the higher , next - to - leading ( nlo ) processes .",
    "perturbative qcd does not predict the absolute value of the parton densities within the proton but determines how they vary from a given input . for a given initial distribution at a particular scale altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) evolution",
    "@xcite enables the distributions at higher @xmath18 to be determined .",
    "dglap evolution resums the leading @xmath22 contributions associated with a chain of gluon emissions . at large enough electron - proton centre - of - mass energies",
    "there is a second large variable @xmath23 and , therefore , it is also necessary to resum the @xmath24 contributions .",
    "this is acheived by using the bfkl equation  @xcite .",
    "to relate the hadronic final state to the underlying hard partonic behaviour it is generally necessary to apply a jet algorithm .",
    "the jade algorithm  @xcite has been used in the following analyses as it was , at the time , the only algorithm which allowed comparison to the nlo calculations ( projet  @xcite and disjet  @xcite ) .",
    "the jade algorithm is a cluster algorithm based on the scaled invariant mass - squared @xmath25 for any two objects @xmath26 and @xmath27 assuming that these objects are massless .",
    "@xmath28 is the squared invariant mass of the hadronic final state and @xmath29 is the angle between the two objects of energies @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",

    "if the value of this minimum @xmath32 is less than the variable cut - off parameter @xmath33 , the two objects @xmath26 and @xmath27 are merged into a new object by adding their four - momenta and the process is repeated until all @xmath34 .",
    "the surviving objects are called jets which represent the underlying partonic structure that is dependent on @xmath35 .    figures  [ fig : jet_rates]a  d show the zeus jet rates using data taken in 1994 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 as a function of  for data compared with the disjet and projet nlo qcd calculations for three @xmath18 intervals",

    "in addition the figure shows the curves for @xmath48 = 100 , 200 , and 300  mev .",
    "an extrapolation to @xmath35(@xmath49 ) yields : @xmath50 which are consistent with other values obtained from a large variety of different processes as shown fig .",
    "[ fig : alphas ] ( see  @xcite for references ) .",
    "even with the current statistics the hera measurements are already competitive with those made elsewhere .    recently two new , more flexible nlo calculations ( mepjet  @xcite and disent  @xcite ) have become available allowing the experiments to analyze the data using any particular jet algorithm .",
    "the @xmath51 algorithm  @xcite is particularly suited for dis as it allows factorization between the beam fragmentation and the hard process  @xcite .",
    "the zeus collaboration has reanalyzed  @xcite their 1994 data using this algorithm .",
    "the preliminary values of @xmath35(@xmath45 ) obtained in the three bins of @xmath45 are shown ( with statistical errors only ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphas ] and are consistent with the results obtained with the jade algorithm .",
    "a natural frame in which to study the dynamics of the hadronic final state in dis is the breit frame  @xcite . in this frame",
    "the exchanged virtual boson is purely space - like with 3-momentum @xmath52 , the incident quark carries momentum @xmath53 in the positive @xmath54 direction , and the outgoing struck quark carries q/2 in the negative @xmath54 direction .",
    "a final state particle has a 4-momentum @xmath55 in this frame , and is assigned to the current region if @xmath56 is negative , and to the target frame if @xmath56 is positive .",
    "the advantage of this frame lies in the maximal separation of the outgoing parton from radiation associated with the incoming parton and the proton remnant , thus providing the optimal environment for the study of the fragmentation of the outgoing parton .",
    "event shape variables have been investigated in @xmath57 experiments and used to extract the strong coupling constant @xmath58 independent of any jet algorithm , see _ eg _ ref .",
    "h1 have recently performed a similar analysis  @xcite in deep inelastic scattering in the current fragmentation region of the breit frame .",
    "the event shape dependence on @xmath45 ( or energy dependence ) can be due to the logarithmic change of the strong coupling constant @xmath59 , and/or power corrections ( hadronisation effects ) which are expected to behave like @xmath60 .",
    "recent theoretical developments suggest that @xmath60 corrections are not necessarily related to hadronisation , but may instead be a universal soft gluon phenomenon associated with the behaviour of the running coupling at small momentum scales  @xcite .",
    "h1 have analysed a number of infrared safe ( ie independent of the number of partons produced ) event shape variables .",
    "their definitions are given below , where the sums extend over all hadrons @xmath61 ( being a calorimetric cluster in the detector or a parton in the qcd calculations ) with four - momentum @xmath62 the current hemisphere axis @xmath63 coincides with the virtual boson direction .    * * thrust @xmath64 * @xmath65 * * thrust @xmath66 * @xmath67 * * jet broadening @xmath68 * @xmath69 * * scaled jet mass @xmath70 * @xmath71    a common characteristic of the mean event shape values @xmath72 and @xmath73 is the fact that they exhibit a clear decrease with rising @xmath45 , fig .",
    "[ meandata ] .",
    "this is due to fact that the energy flow becomes more collimated along the event shape axis as @xmath45 increases , a phenomenon also observed in annihilation experiments .",
    "h1 showed by fitting to the data in fig .",
    "[ meandata ] all the event shape variables can be well described by just the first order power corrections @xmath74 without the need for any higher order corrections .",
    "the second order perturbative qcd parton predictions are also shown and their discrepancies with the data show that the power corrections are substantial at low values of @xmath45 , but become less important with increasing energy .",
    "the analysis of the event shapes give results consistent with each other for @xmath75 the power correction parameter thus supporting the prediction of universality  @xcite , and also gives consistent values of @xmath76 the results of the fit are @xmath77 for the power correction parameter and @xmath78 for the strong coupling constant in the @xmath79 scheme .",
    "these values are compatible with those extracted by   experiments  @xcite",
    "fragmentation functions represent the probability for a parton to fragment into a particular hadron carrying a certain fraction of the parton s energy .",
    "fragmentation functions incorporate the long distance , non - perturbative physics of the hadronization process in which the observed hadrons are formed from final state partons of the hard scattering process and , like structure functions , can not be calculated in perturbative qcd , but can be evolved from a starting distribution at a defined energy scale . if the fragmentation functions are combined with the cross sections for the inclusive production of each parton type in the given physical process , predictions can be made for the scaled momentum , @xmath80 spectra of final state hadrons .",
    "small @xmath81 fragmentation is significantly affected by the coherence ( destructive interference ) of soft gluons  @xcite , whilst scaling violation of the fragmentation function at large @xmath81 allows a measurement of @xmath35  @xcite .    in  annihilation",
    "the two quarks are produced with equal and opposite momenta , @xmath82 this can be compared with a quark struck from within the proton with outgoing momentum @xmath83 in the breit frame . in the direction of the struck quark ( the current fragmentation region ) the particle momentum spectra ,",
    "@xmath84 are expected to have a dependence on @xmath45 similar to those observed in  annihilation  @xcite at energy @xmath85    the inclusive charged particle distributions  @xcite , @xmath86 are shown in figure  [ nlo ] plotted in bins of fixed @xmath81 as a function of @xmath87 for @xmath88 the distributions rise with @xmath18 at low @xmath81 and fall - off at high @xmath81 and high @xmath18 . by measuring the amount of scaling violation one can ultimately measure the amount of parton radiation and thus determine @xmath89 below @xmath90 the fall off is due to depopulation of the current region .    the results can be compared to the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd calculations , as implemented in cyclops  @xcite , of the charged particle inclusive distributions in the restricted region @xmath91 and @xmath92 where the theoretical uncertainties are small , unaffected by the hadron mass effects which are not included in the fragmentation function .",
    "this comparison is shown in figure  [ nlo ] .",
    "the nlo calculation combines a full next - to - leading order matrix element with the @xmath93 parton densities ( with a @xmath94 and nlo fragmentation functions derived by binnewies et al . from fits to @xmath57 data @xcite . the data and the nlo calculations are in good agreement , supporting the idea of universality of quark fragmentation .",
    "the peak position of the  distributions , , was evaluated .",
    "figure  [ figure : slope ] shows the distribution of  as a function of @xmath45 for the hera data  @xcite and of @xmath95 for the @xmath57 data . over the range",
    "shown the peak moves from @xmath96  1.5 to 3.0 , equivalent to the position of the maximum of the corresponding momentum spectrum increasing from @xmath96  400 to 900  mev .",
    "the hera data points are consistent with those from tasso  @xcite data and a clear agreement in the rate of growth of the hera points with the @xmath57 data  @xcite is observed .",
    "the increase of  can be approximated phenomenologically by the straight line fit @xmath97 also shown in figure  [ figure : slope ] .",
    "also shown is the statistical fit to the data when @xmath98 which would be the case if the qcd cascade was of an incoherent nature , dominated by cylindrical phase space .",
    "( a discussion of phase space effects is given in  @xcite . ) in such a case , the logarithmic particle momentum spectrum would be peaked at a constant value of momentum , independent of @xmath45 .",
    "the observed gradient is clearly inconsistent with @xmath98 and therefore inconsistent with cylindrical phase space thus supporting the coherent nature of gluon radiation .",
    "in the dglap parton evolution scheme  @xcite the parton cascade follows a strong ordering in transverse momentum @xmath99 , while there is only a soft ( kinematical ) ordering for the fractional momentum @xmath100 .",
    "however for low-@xmath17 at hera the bfkl scheme  @xcite could well be the dominant scheme . in this scheme",
    "the cascade follows a strong ordering in fractional momentum @xmath101 , while there is no ordering in transverse momentum .",
    "bfkl evolution can be enhanced by studying dis events which contain an identified jet of longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath102 ( in the proton direction ) which is large compared to bjorken @xmath17  @xcite . by tagging a forward jet with @xmath103",
    "this allows minimal phase space for dglap evolution while the condition @xmath104 leaves bfkl evolution active .",
    "this leads to the forward jet production cross section in bfkl dynamics being larger than that of the @xmath105 qcd calculation with dglap evolution  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : h1comp ] , recent data from h1  @xcite and zeus  @xcite are compared with bfkl predictions  @xcite and fixed order qcd predictions as calculated with the mepjet  @xcite program at nlo . the conditions @xmath103 and @xmath104 are satisfied in the two experiments by slightly different selection cuts .",
    "h1 selects events with a forward jet of @xmath106  gev ( in the angular region @xmath107 ) with @xmath108 while zeus triggers on somewhat harder jets of @xmath109  gev and @xmath110 with @xmath111    fig .",
    "[ fig : h1comp ] shows that both experiments observe substantially more forward jet events than expected from nlo qcd .",
    "a very rough estimate of the uncertainty of the nlo calculation is provided by the two dotted lines , which correspond to variations by a factor 10 of the renormalisation and factorisation scales @xmath112 and @xmath113 . a recent bfkl calculation ( dashed lines )",
    "gives a better agreement with the data .",
    "the overall normalisation in this calculation is uncertain and the agreement may be fortuitous , indeed it should also be noted that both experiments observe more centrally produced dijet events than predicted by the nlo qcd calculations . further careful investigation is necessary before claiming that bfkl is the mechanism for this enhanced forward jet production .",
    "to understand the underlying qcd processes in dis it is necessary to study the hadronic final state . at the current level of understanding ,",
    "qcd works well and describes the hera data .",
    "as the precision of the hera data improves and the nlo qcd calculations become available the framework of qcd is being tested more thoroughly .",
    "as yet it is not possible to say conclusively whether the effects of bfkl dynamics are being observed in the hera data , much theoretical and experimental work is in progress to define and measure variables that will allow a definitive statement .",
