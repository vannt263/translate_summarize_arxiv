    "we interprete  ( [ maineq ] ) in a weak sense as the eigenvalue problem for the dirichlet laplacian @xmath3 acting in the hilbert space  @xmath4 , and recall that @xmath3 is the non - negative self - adjoint operator associated with the quadratic form @xmath5 : = \\|\\nabla v\\|_{{l}^2(\\omega)}^2 \\ , ,    \\qquad    v \\in { \\mathcal{d}}(q_d^\\omega ) : = { \\mathcal{h}}_0 ^ 1(\\omega ) \\,.\\ ] ] we denote by @xmath6 the non - decreasing sequence of numbers corresponding to the spectral problem of  @xmath3 according to the rayleigh - ritz variational formula  ( * ? ? ?",
    "each  @xmath7 represents either a discrete eigenvalue or the threshold of the essential spectrum ( if  @xmath1 is not bounded ) .",
    "all the eigenvalues below the essential spectrum of the boundary - value problem  ( [ maineq ] ) may be characterized by this variational principle .",
    "the nodal line of a real eigenfunction @xmath8 of the problem  ( [ maineq ] ) is defined by @xmath9 and the connected components into which  @xmath1 is divided by  @xmath10 are called the nodal domains of @xmath8 . by the courant nodal domain theorem an eigenfunction corresponding to the @xmath11  eigenvalue below the essential spectrum has at most  @xmath12 nodal domains",
    "( see  @xcite for the proof in the bounded case , the generalization to the unbounded case being straightforward ) .",
    "in particular , since the first eigenvalue below the essential spectrum is always simple and the corresponding eigenfunction can be chosen to be positive , any eigenfunction corresponding to the second eigenvalue below the essential spectrum will have exactly two nodal domains .",
    "apart from this result , very little is known regarding the structure of the nodal lines , but much work has been developed over the last three decades around a conjecture of payne s which states that a second eigenfunction of the above problem can not have a closed nodal line .",
    "this conjecture is also quite often stated as follows :    [ conj ] the nodal line of any second eigenfunction of the laplacian intersects the boundary @xmath13 at exactly two points .",
    "the most general result obtained so far was given by melas in 1992 , who showed that the above conjecture holds in the case of bounded planar convex domains  @xcite .",
    "this followed a string of results obtained under some symmetry restrictions by several authors ( payne himself included ) ",
    "see , for instance ,  @xcite and the references therein .",
    "on the other hand , several counterexamples have also been presented , of which the most significant is that in  @xcite showing that the result does not hold for multiply connected planar domains in general .",
    "other counterexamples have been given illustrating other ways in which the conjecture may not hold .",
    "these include adding a potential  ( @xcite ) and the case of simply - connected surfaces  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this note is to give examples showing that if one does not require the domain to be bounded , then the nodal line need not touch the boundary even under the same assumptions that have been previously used in the bounded case to prove the conjecture .",
    "more precisely we will prove the following    [ t1 ] there exists a simply - connected unbounded planar domain  @xmath1 which is convex and symmetric with respect to two orthogonal directions , and for which the nodal line of a second eigenfunction does not touch the boundary  @xmath13 .",
    "this domain can be chosen as one of the following two types :    1 .",
    "the distance between the nodal line of a second eigenfunction and the boundary @xmath13 is bounded away from zero , but the spectrum is not purely discrete ; 2 .",
    "the spectrum consists only of discrete eigenvalues , but the infimum of the distance between a point on the nodal line of a second eigenfunction and the boundary @xmath13 is zero .    the idea behind both examples is to start from a bounded convex domain  @xmath14 which is invariant under reflections through two orthogonal lines  @xmath15 and  @xmath16 , and which we will assume to be sufficiently long in the direction  @xmath17 , such that its second eigenvalue is simple and any corresponding eigenfunction is antisymmetric with respect to  @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , its second nodal line will be given by the closure of  @xmath18 .",
    "we then append two sufficiently thin semi - infinite strips to @xmath19 in neighbourhoods of the points where its second nodal line touches the boundary , in such a way that the nodal line coincides with the axis  @xmath15 and thus stays within these strips without touching the boundary  see figure  [ fig ] .    in order to establish case  ( i ) , we will consider domains which are asymptotically cylindrical  see the classification of euclidean domains in  @xcite , where these sets are called quasi - cylindrical .",
    "this means that there will also exist essential spectrum , and so it will be necessary to prove that the domain does indeed possess a second discrete eigenvalue in this case . in order for condition  ( ii ) to be satisfied , we will need to consider what are referred to in  @xcite as quasi - bounded domains .",
    "this means that the domains are asymptotically narrow and thus , although the nodal line does not touch the boundary , it does get asymptotically close to it .",
    "it should be stressed here that while the nodal line in both our examples does not touch the boundary , it is not closed .",

    ", it is easy to see that @xmath34 and that one can produce an arbitrary number of eigenvalues below the essential spectrum by making  @xmath35 small enough . furthermore , if  @xmath36 tends to zero at infinity then @xmath37 and the spectrum of  @xmath38 consists of discrete eigenvalues only . in any case , one has the following convergence result .        in view of  ( [ sp.ess ] ) and",
    "lemma  [ lem.convergence ] , @xmath42 and  @xmath43 are discrete simple eigenvalues for all sufficiently small  @xmath35 .",
    "since the eigenfunction corresponding to  @xmath42 can be chosen to be positive , the eigenfunction  @xmath44 corresponding to  @xmath43 has to change sign in  @xmath31 .",
    "we now prove a result which will give us immediately the conclusions of the theorem .",

    "due to the symmetry of  @xmath31 , the corresponding eigenfunction  @xmath44 must be symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to  @xmath15 , and symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to  @xmath16 .",
    "this observation and the courant nodal domain theorem yield that the nodal set  @xmath48 is either the closure of  @xmath49 , the axis  @xmath15 or a closed loop .",
    "the last possibility is excluded by mimicking the argument given in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) for bounded domains with the required symmetry and convexity .",
    "we will exclude the first possibility by using the fact that the second eigenvalue of a domain is the first eigenvalue of any of the nodal subdomains .",
