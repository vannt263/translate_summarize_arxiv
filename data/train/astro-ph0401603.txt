    "it is well established that the interstellar medium ( ism ) is turbulent . from the theoretical point of view",
    "this arises from the very large reynolds numbers present in the ism ( the reynolds number is defined as the inverse ratio of the dynamical timescale -or _ eddy turnover time_- to the viscous damping timescale ) . from an observational standpoint there is also plenty of evidence that supports a turbulent ism , where the turbulence expands over scales that range from au to kpc @xcite .",
    "this turbulence is very important for many physical processes , including star formation , cosmic ray propagation , heat transport , and heating of the ism ( for a review see @xcite ; @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "how to compare interstellar turbulence with the results of numerical simulations and theoretical expectations is an important question that must be addressed .",
    "after all , theoretical constructions involve necessary simplifications , while numerical simulations of turbulence involve reynolds , and magnetic reynolds numbers that are very different from those in the ism .",
    "are numerical simulations of ism of value ?",
    "to what extent do they reproduce interstellar turbulence ?",
    "these sort of questions one attempts to answer with observations .",
    "substantial advances in understanding of scaling of compressible mhd turbulence ( see reviews by @xcite , and references therein ) allow to provide a direct comparison of the theoretical expectations with observations .",
    "how reliable are the turbulence spectra obtained via observations",
    "?    studies of statistics of turbulence have been fruitful using interstellar scintillations @xcite .",
    "however this technique is restricted to the study of ionized media , and very importantly to density fluctuations alone ( see @xcite ) .",
    "nowadays , radio spectroscopic observations of neutral media provide us with an enormous amount of data containing information about interstellar turbulence , including a more direct physical quantity to study turbulence : velocity .",
    "but the emissivity of a spectral line depends on both the velocity and density fields simultaneously , and the separation of their individual contribution is not trivial .",
    "much effort has been put into this difficult task and several statistical measures have been proposed to extract information of velocity from spectroscopic data ( see review by @xcite ) . among the simplest we can mention the use of line - widths @xcite .",
    "velocity centroids have been around as measure of the velocity field for a long time now @xcite .",
    "and they have been widely used to study turbulence in molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "power - spectra , correlation , and structure functions have been traditionally , and still are , the most widely used tools to characterize the statistics of emissivity maps .",
    "these statistical tools have been used to study the scaling properties of turbulence , e.g. to determine its the spectral index .",
    "recently , more elaborated techniques have been proposed to analyze observational data , such as `` @xmath1-variance '' wavelet transform @xcite .",
    "such techniques can be used to obtain velocity information from spectral data with some advantages , like being less sensitive to the effects of edges or noise .",
    "regardless of the method used , it is usually assumed that the map traces the velocity fluctuations , which as we show below this is not always true . to separate velocity from density contribution `` modified velocity centroids '' ( mvcs )",
    "were derived in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter le03 ) .",
    "there has been an effort in parallel to develop new statistics that trace velocity fluctuations .",
    "here we can mention the `` spectral correlation function '' -scf- @xcite , `` velocity channel analysis '' -vca- @xcite , mvcs ( le03 ) , and `` velocity coordinate spectrum '' -vcs- @xcite .",
    "both vca and vcs are good for studies of supersonic turbulence .",

    "numerical simulations provide us with an ideal testing ground for the statistical tools available for application to observational data .",
    "however we must note that the situation is rather complex .",
    "on one hand , real observations depend critically on the physical properties of the object under study , such as variations in the excitation state of the tracer and the radiation transfer within it ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in addition observational limitations , like finite signal - to - noise ratio and map size , griding effects , beam pattern , beam error , etc .",
    "are also present . on the other hand ,",
    "numerical simulations have their own limitations , such as finite box size and resolution , numerical viscosity , and the physics available to a particular code .",
    "this paper is mostly concerned about the projection effects and the impact of density fluctuations to centroid maps , which are shared by observations and simulations .",
    "in le03 we studied the maps of velocity centroids as tracers of the turbulent velocity statistics .",
    "we derived analytical relations between the two point statistics of velocity centroids and those of the underlying velocity field .",
    "we also identified an important term in the structure function of centroids which includes information of density , and that can be extracted from observables .",
    "subtraction of that term can isolate better the velocity contribution , and this yielded to a new measure that we termed `` modified velocity centroids '' ( mvcs ) .",
    "in le03 we proposed a criterion for determining whether velocity centroids reflect the scaling properties of underlying turbulent velocity ( e.g. structure functions or spectra of velocity ) .",
    "a major goal of this paper is to test the predictions in le03 using synthetic maps obtained via mhd simulations and to determine when velocity centroids indeed reflect the velocity statistics .",
    "earlier on , in @xcite we showed how velocity centroids can be used to reveal the anisotropy of mhd turbulence and how this anisotropy can be used for studies of plane - of - sky magnetic field .",
    "this technique was further discussed by @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show how mach number and alfvn mach number affect the anisotropy of velocity centroid statistics .",
    "the results of le03 obtained in terms of structure functions are trivially recasted in terms of spectra and correlation functions .",
    "therefore we use structure , correlation functions and spectra interchangeably through our paper , depending what measure is more convenient . while being interchangeable , for practical statistical data handling different measures have their own advantages and disadvantages .",
    "we discuss those on the example of power - law scalar field and thus benchmark our further velocity centroid study .",
    "we also deal with a potentially pernicious issue of non - uniformity of notations and normalizations that plague the relevant literature by having details of our derivations in the appendixes that constitute an important part of the paper .    in this work",
    "we perform a detailed numerical study of the ability of velocity centroids to extract turbulent velocity statistics , we study the issues of velocity - density correlations and outline the relation of velocity centroids to other techniques . in ",
    "2 we review the basic problem of the density and velocity contributions to spectroscopic observations .",
    "we summarize le03 in  3 , we include in this work appendices with mathematical derivations omitted in our earlier short communication . in ",
    "4 we test the analytical predictions , and the spectral indices from our numerical data . in ",
    "5 we show how centroids can be used for turbulence anisotropy studies and determination of the plane - of - sky direction of magnetic field .",
    "a discussion of the results can be found in  6 , and a summary in  7 .",
    "due to the stochastic nature of turbulence it is best described by statistical measures . among these",
    "we have two point statistics such as structure functions , correlation functions , and power spectra ( see for instance * ? ? ?",
    ". their definition and a more comprehensive discussion can be found in appendix a. structure and correlation functions depend in general on a `` lag '' @xmath2 , the separation between two points @xmath3 and @xmath4 , such that @xmath5 .",
    "power spectrum is defined as the fourier transform of the correlation function , and is function of the wave - number vector @xmath6 . with amplitude @xmath7 , where @xmath8 .",
    "additional simplification is achieved if the turbulent field is isotropic , in which case structure and correlation functions depend only on the magnitude of the separation @xmath9 ( and not on the direction ) , similarly power spectrum is only function of @xmath10 .",
    "this is not strictly true for magnetized media , as the presence of a magnetic field introduces a preferential direction for motion .",
    "in fact , mhd turbulence becomes axisymmetric in a system of reference defined by the direction of the _ local _ magnetic field ( see reviews by @xcite and @xcite ) , thus breaking the isotropy .",
    "however , since the local direction changes from one place to another , the anisotropy is rather modest and it is still possible to characterize the turbulence with isotropic statistics ( see @xcite ) .      in the simplest realization of turbulence",
    "we have injection of energy at the largest scales .",
    "the energy cascades down without losses to the small scales , at which viscous forces become important and turbulence is dissipated . at intermediate scales , between the injection and",
    "the dissipation scales , the turbulent cascade is _ self - similar_. this range constitutes the so called _ inertial - range_. there the physical variables are proportional to simple powers of eddy sizes , and the two point statistics can be described by power - laws . for power - law statistics @xcite discussed two regimes , a _ short - wave - dominated _ regime , corresponding to a _ shallow _ spectrum , and a _ long - wave - dominated _ spectrum , with a _ steep _ spectrum .",
    "while dealing with numerical data one encounters a few non - trivial effects that we find advantageous to discuss below .",
    "the insight into the limitations of numerical procedures that involve conversion from mathematically equivalent statistics helps us for the rest of the paper .",
    "consider an isotropic power - law one - dimensional power - spectrum of the form @xmath11 a _ steep _ spectrum corresponds to spectral indices @xmath12 .",

    "the relation between the spectral index of the structure function and power spectrum can be generalized for isotropic fields to @xmath18 , with @xmath19 where n is the number of dimensions ( see appendix a ) . for instance , the velocity ( @xmath20 ) in kolmogorov turbulence scales as @xmath21 , which corresponds to a spectral index for the structure function of @xmath22 , to a three - dimensional power - spectrum ( @xmath23 ) index @xmath24 , a two - dimensional power - spectrum ( @xmath25 ) index @xmath26 , and a one - dimensional power - spectrum @xmath27 index @xmath28 .",
    "note that kolmogorov spectrum falls into the steep spectra category .",
    "structure functions given by equation ( [ eq : drpowlaw ] ) are well defined only for @xmath29 , which allows to satisfy @xmath30 and @xmath31 , so that the representation in terms of fourier integrals is possible ( see @xcite ) .. it is important to notice also that for a power - law steep spectrum the structure function is a power - law , but the correlation function is not ( see eq . [ [ eq : dij_dec ] ] ) . the correlation function is a constant minus a growing ( positive index ) power - law , therefore in a log - log scale is flat at small scales , and drops at large scales . ]    to illustrate the relation between the two point statistics and power - law spectrum , as well as the difficulties associated with handling numerical data .",
    "we produced a three - dimensional gaussian cube with a prescribed ( 3d ) spectral index of @xmath24 , as described in @xcite .",
    "this type of data - cubes are somewhat similar to the fractional brownian motion ( fbms ) fields used by @xcite , or the _ de - phased _ fields used in @xcite .",
    "however , as in real observations , they do not have perfect power - law spectrum for a particular realization , but only in a statistical sense ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in figure [ fig:3dsteep ]",
    "we show the calculated 3d power spectrum , structure and correlation functions of our steep gaussian cube , and compare them with the prescribed scaling properties .",
    "the power spectrum is computed using fast fourier transform ( fft ) in 3d and then averaged in wave - number @xmath10 .",
    "ideally one can compute directly in real space the 3d structure or correlation functions , however for a 3d field of the dimensions used here ( @xmath32 ) is already quite expensive computationally .",
    "it would require looping over all the points in the data - cube to do the average and repeat for all the possible values for the lag ( in three dimensions as well ) .",
    "fortunately , since the data - cubes were produced using fft we can safely compute the correlation function with spectral methods .",
    "the correlation function can be expressed as a convolution integral @xmath33 , which can be calculated as a simple product of the fourier tranformed fields .",
    "that is , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the fourier transform of @xmath36 , and @xmath37 its complex conjugate .",
    "then , with the use of equation ( [ eq : dij_dec ] ) we can obtain the structure function .",
    "the resulting correlation and structure functions in 3d are then averaged in @xmath9 . an important thing",
    "to notice is that the gaussian cubes have wrap - around periodicity , and the largest variation available correspond to scales of @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the size of the computational box .",
    "in fact , we only plot the structure and correlation functions up to such separations .",
    "we see a fair agreement with prescribed and the measured scaling properties .",
    "the power spectrum in figure [ fig:3dsteep](_a _ ) shows departures from strict power - law which are more evident for small wave - numbers .",
    "this is natural for this type of data - cubes , where random deviations from strict power - law are expected at all scales .",
    "but at large scales ( small @xmath10 ) we have fewer points for the statistics and the departures do not average to zero , while at small scales they almost do .",
    "when the energy spectrum is shallow ( i.e. @xmath40 ) , the fluctuations of the field are dominated by small - scales , therefore termed _ short - wave - dominated _ regime .",
    "density at high mach number is an example of such shallow spectrum ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case neither the structure nor correlation functions can be strictly represented by power - laws .",
    "in fact , in order for the fourier transforms to converge in this case we need to introduce a cutoff for small wave - numbers , such that the power spectrum is only a power - law for @xmath41 , in other words @xmath42 to a power spectrum of this form corresponds a correlation function of fluctuations : @xmath43 where , @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the @xmath46-order , modified bessel function of the second kind ( also sometimes referred as hyperbolic bessel function ) , and @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "the nth - dimensional power spectrum index for a correlation function of the form @xmath48 can also be generalized to @xmath49 , with @xmath50 this relation is very similar to that for the long wave dominated case ( eq[[eq : gammand ] ] ) .",
    "actually for @xmath51 , @xmath52 can be expanded as @xmath53 , thus the 3d correlation function ( as opposed to the structure function as in the long wave dominated regime ) goes as a power - law @xmath54 for small separations .",
    "notice that for a shallow spectrum the structure function grows rapidly at the smallest scales and then flattens .",
    "similarly to the steep spectrum , we produced a short - wave - dominated gaussian 3d field , with a prescribed index of @xmath55 . in figure [ fig:3dshallow ]",
    "we present the expected , and calculated two point statistics . here",
    "the critical scale @xmath56 is determined by the smallest wave - number ( @xmath57 ) , in our case it corresponds to the size of the computational box ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "we see again a fair agreement with the prescribed and calculated spectra .",
    "however , figure [ fig:3dshallow ] reveals a significant departure of the calculated correlation function with the prediction from equation ( [ eq : brshallow ] ) for large lags .",
    "the explanation of such difference is that the analytical relations of spectra ( eqs .",
    "[ [ eq : ekpowlaw ] , [ eq : ekshallow ] ] ) with structure and correlation functions ( eqs . [",
    "[ eq : drpowlaw ] , [ eq : brshallow ] ] ) is exact only in the limit of continuous integrals over infinite wave - numbers .",
    "the data - sets presented in this section are constructed in fourier space , then translated to real space by means of discrete fourier transforms of the form : @xmath59 \\label{eq : ft_sum}\\ ] ] the sum runs from @xmath60 ensuring that @xmath61 . in practice , we evaluate the fourier transforms via fft and set explicitly the @xmath62 component of the spectrum to zero to guarantee that the average of the fluctuating part of the field is null .",
    "the resulting field has a limited range of harmonics available , determined basically by the computational grid size ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "we have constructed large 1d fields , in which we see that the gap between the analytical and the computed correlation functions gets smaller as we increase resolution .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that spectra shows a much better correspondence than correlation functions .",
    "at the same time , structure functions do not deal with the lowest harmonics , which introduce largest errors ( see * ? ? ? * ) . and",
    "therefore , they are less affected by the lack of lower harmonics as can be confirmed by the fact that they are closer to the analytical prediction than correlation functions .",
    "it is important to always keep in mind the issues that can arise from the discrete nature of the data .",
    "however , we must note that this particular problem lies within the generation of the data - sets in frequency space and not in the computation of correlation or structure functions via spectral methods .",
    "we obtain identical results using fft and looping in directly in real space to do the average required . in real life ,",
    "the limitation is likely to be in the opposite direction : the finite wave - numbers available would show up as uncertainty in determining the power spectra while structure and correlation functions should be estimated with smaller errors ( if measured directly in real space ) .      from spectroscopic observations we can not obtain either the density or velocity fields in real space ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) , but we have to deal with projections along the line of sight ( los ) .",
    "despite the fact that our main goal is to extract velocity statistics from the centroids of velocity , we will discuss in this section the statistics of density integrated along the los ( column density ) .",
    "it will become clear later that the same procedure can be applied to obtain velocity statistics .",
    "the issue of projection has been previously discussed in @xcite , here we briefly state some results that are relevant to this work . in appendix",
    "b we exemplify the projection effects of structure functions for the particular case of power - law statistics . and in appendix c the power - spectrum of a homogeneous field that has been integrated along the los .",
    "in what follows we will assume that the emissivity of our medium is proportional to the first power of the density ( this is true , for instance , in the case of ) .",
    "we will consider an isothermal medium , and neglect the effects of self - absorption . in this case",
    "the integrated intensity of the emission ( integrated along the velocity coordinate ) is proportional to the column density ( see appendix a for more details ) : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a constant and @xmath68 is the mass density . the density of emitters @xmath69 can be identified as the column density per velocity interval , commonly referred as @xmath70 . to distinguish between 2d and 3d vectors",
    ", we will use capital letters to denote the former and lower case for the latter ( i.e. @xmath71 $ ] , @xmath72 $ ] ) .",
    "our assumption is satisfied for observational data where the medium is optically thin , thermalized , and with constant excitation conditions .",
    "however , for any observed map its applicability has to be examined carefully . even for",
    "widespread self - absorption has been detected ( for example @xcite ) .",

    "clearly @xmath74 does not necessarily have to coincide with the transverse size ( in the plane of the sky ) of the object under study , however that is the case in our data - sets . as described in @xcite , we can expand the square in equation ( [ eq : i1i2def ] ) combining @xmath75 and the elementary identity @xmath76 , \\label{eq : elem}\\ ] ] to obtain @xmath73^{2}\\right\\rangle = \\alpha^{2}\\int_{0}^{z_{tot}}\\int_{0}^{z_{tot}}{\\rm d}z_{1}{\\rm d}z_{2}\\left[d_{\\rho}(\\mathbf{r})-\\left.d_{\\rho}(\\mathbf{r})\\right|_{\\mathbf{x}_{1}=\\mathbf{x}_{2}}\\right ] .",

    "\\label{eq : drho}\\ ] ] this definition is general and does not require any particular functional form of the 3d structure functions ( i.e. power - law statistics ) .",
    "the problem of formally inverting equation ( [ eq : i1i2dr1dr2 ] ) to obtain the underlying statistics , allowing for anisotropic turbulence , with an arbitrary spectrum ( i.e. not a power - law ) , has been presented in @xcite , but it is somewhat mathematically involved . for 3d fields with a power - law spectrum , homogeneous and isotropic ,",
    "the structure functions of the integrated fields ( 2d maps ) can be simply approximated by two power - laws , one at small the other at large separations ( see @xcite , and also appendix b ) .",
    "for instance , if the density has a power - spectrum @xmath79 , the structure function of column density will have the form @xmath73^{2}\\right\\rangle \\propto r^{\\mu } , \\label{eq : i1i1pow - law}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is the separation in the plane of the sky ( @xmath81 ) , and @xmath82    in contrast , the power spectrum of a field integrated along the los corresponds to selecting only the @xmath83 components of the underlying 3d spectra , more precisely only the solenoidal part ( see appendix c ) .",
    "thus , for isotropic and homogeneous power - law statistics the 2d power spectrum will reflect the 3d spectral index . if for instance the density has a power spectrum @xmath79 , the spectrum of column density will scale as @xmath84    we computed spectra and structure functions for the gaussian cubes used before , integrated along the @xmath65 direction . and presented them in figure [ fig:2dgauss ] along with the the expected behavior from eqs.([eq : mu ] ) and ( [ eq : p2d_gamma3d ] ) .    for the structure functions we show only the asymptotic behavior for small separations ( @xmath85 )",
    "as the @xmath86 scales are unavailable ( the maximum scale not affected by wrap - around periodicity is @xmath87 ) .",
    "if the los size of the object under study is much smaller than its size in the plane of the sky ( so @xmath88 is possible ) we would see the underlying 3d spectral index of the structure functions for large separations ( i.e. no projection effect ) . with enough resolution we could use the 2d spectral index of the column density map for @xmath89 to infer the underlying 3d index of the density .",
    "however , for the resolution used here ( @xmath32 pixels ) , the projected structure function for small lags is already in the transition between the two asymptotics in eq.[[eq : mu ] ] .",
    "thus the measured index of the projected map is always shallower ( smaller ) than the actual @xmath90 .",
    "another subtle , yet interesting point , is that power spectrum applied to map of integrated velocity field , such as @xmath91 will recover only the incompressible ( solenoidal ) component of the field .",
    "this could be potentially used to study the role of compressibility in turbulence statistics , by combining velocity centroids and vca ( le03 ) .",
    "velocity centroids have been widely used to relate their statistics with velocity , their conventional form is @xcite @xmath92 we will refer to this definition as `` normalized '' centroids .",
    "the denominator in equation ( [ eq : c ] ) introduces an extra algebraic complication for a direct analytical treatment of the two - point statistics . for the sake of simplicity we start considering `` unnormalized '' velocity centroids : @xmath93 ( notice that they have units of density times velocity as opposed to velocity alone ) .",
    "similarly to the expression in equation ( [ eq : i ] ) , with emissivity proportional to the first power of the density , and no self absorption , the structure function of the unnormalized velocity centroids is : @xmath94^{2}\\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle \\left(\\alpha\\int v_{z}(\\mathbf{x_{1}})\\ \\rho(\\mathbf{x_{1}})\\ { \\rm d}z-\\alpha\\int v_{z}(\\mathbf{x_{2}})\\ \\rho(\\mathbf{x_{2}})\\ { \\rm d}z\\right)^{2}\\right\\rangle .",

    "if @xmath123 and @xmath124 can be neglected the spectrum of unnormalized centroids will trace the solenoidal component of the underlying velocity spectrum ( @xmath125 $ ] , see appendix c ) .",

    "this background ( and disregarding the cross - terms @xmath128 $ ] , @xmath129 $ ] ) we arrived in le03 to a criterion for safe use of ( unnormalized ) velocity centroids : _ if _ @xmath130^{2}\\right\\rangle \\gg",

    "then the criterion proposed in le03 can be simplified to use only the variances of the two maps ( and the velocity dispersion ) : @xmath131 if any of these two criteria is violated , one could in principle subtract the contribution of density and the mvcs would trace velocity structure function , provided that we could neglect the cross - terms .    the contribution of velocity - density cross - correlations ( @xmath132 $ ] ) have been studied earlier . for vca",

    "at the same time the cross - term can be studied analytically for power - law statistics as presented in appendix e , and will not be zero , even in the case of uncorrelated velocity and density fields . before computing them directly , in order to get a feeling of how important the cross - term could become one can consider structure functions .",

    "however , in @xmath134 the structure function of velocity is weighted by @xmath136 instead of only @xmath137 , enhancing the velocity statistics compared to the cross - term .",
    "the importance of the cross - term at the small scales ( in which we are most interested ) will depend on details such as how steep the underlying structure functions are ( see appendix e ) , and the zero levels of density and velocity ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the cross - term scales as @xmath141 , steeper than both velocity and density .",
    "if at large scales @xmath110 and @xmath134 are on the order of @xmath135 , provided that the latter falls more rapidly toward small scales , its contribution will be smaller than both velocity and density structure functions , at those scales .",
    "but if the density or the los velocity ( or both ) , have a shallow spectrum , the cross - term can be larger than @xmath110 or @xmath134 , and can affect significantly the statistics of centroids .",
    "measured spectral indices of density in the literature , range from @xmath142 to @xmath143 , which include both shallow and steep .",
    "this is true for observations in different environments in the ism ( for instance , @xcite ; @xcite ) , as well as for numerical simulations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the velocity spectral index is less known from observations , but has been measured to be only in the steep regime ( for example using vca , e.g. in @xcite ) , also in agreement with simulations . from the theoretical standpoint , at small scales",
    "when self - gravity is important we might expect clumping that result on enhanced small scale structure ( yielding a shallow spectrum ) . on the other hand",
    "there are no clear physical grounds to our knowledge that will produce a small scale dominated ( shallow ) velocity field .",
    "however , even in the simple case of steep density and steep velocity spectra it is not clear beforehand how important density - velocity cross - correlations ( @xmath129 $ ] ) could be .",
    "later , we will analyze the contribution of the cross - terms and density - velocity cross - correlations in more detail , including spectra .",
    "in le03 we performed some preliminary tests of the modified velocity centroids using numerical simulations and compared the power - spectrum with that of velocity field , normalized ( equation [ [ eq : c ] ] ) , and unnormalized centroids ( equation [ [ eq : s ] ] ) . in this section",

    "we do not have power - law statistics ( i.e. inertial range ) at the largest scales ( smallest wave - numbers ) due to the driving of the turbulence . and neither we have power - law statistics at the smallest scales ( largest wave - numbers ) , because of numerical dissipation .",
    "thus , it is very difficult to estimate spectral indices because the measured log - log - slope is quite sensitive to the range in wave - numbers ( or lags ) used .",
    "this poses a problem of obtaining quantitative results .",
    "for that reason , we created another data - set by modifying the original fields to have strict power - law spectra , following the procedure in @xcite .",
    "the procedure consists in modifying the amplitude of the fourier components of the data so they follow a power - law , while keeping the phases intact . this way we preserve most of the spatial information . by keeping the phases we also minimize the effect of the modification to the density - velocity correlations .",
    "in addition , these new fields have the same mean value than the original data - sets , and the magnitude of their power - spectra ( vertical offset ) was fixed to match the original variances as well .",
    "we will refer to this data - sets as `` reformed '' .      column density and centroids of velocity are two - dimensional maps , and therefore it is not computationally restrictive to obtain their correlation or structure function directly in real space .",
    "power - spectrum is often computationally cheaper because fft can be used .",
    "however , inherent difficulties of applying fourier analysis to real data , for instance the lack of periodic boundary conditions and instrumentational response make power spectrum often unreliable . to alleviate this problem more elaborate techniques like wavelet transforms",

    "if the observed maps are not naturally arranged in a cartesian grid one would need to smear the data onto that kind of grid to use fft . which is not necessary for structure or correlation functions if computed directly averaging in configuration space .",
    "in despite of this , because the simulations we used are in a cartesian grid and indeed have periodic boundary conditions , we can compute spectra , correlation , and structure functions using fft ( see  2 ) with as good accuracy than doing the average in real space . the relation between the structure function , correlation function , and power spectrum of unnormalized centroids",

    "is not clear neither from the figures , nor from the measured slopes .",
    "while for the strongly supersonic case ( model d , @xmath230 ) it is obvious that velocity centroids fail to recover the velocity scaling .    due to the finite width effects discussed at the end of ",
    " 2.2 , it is more difficult to determine quantitatively the spectral index from centroid maps using structure functions . according to equation ( [ eq : mu ] ) , one should restrict to measure the spectral index for lags either much smaller , or much larger than the los extent of the object under study .",

    "thus , if we obtain the 3d spectral indices as @xmath231 ( taking @xmath225 from table [ tb:2dindices ] ) , we would only get upper limits of the actual @xmath223 . keeping in mind that our definition of the index includes the minus sign , this means that the real index is going to be more negative than the inferred @xmath223 from structure functions",

    "this can be verified from the better agreement of @xmath231 with @xmath223 measured directly from power - spectra .",

    "at the same time , the problem of recovering quantitatively the spectral index from structure functions might be overcome for real observations with a larger inertial range . with enough spatial resolution one can have easily over two decades of inertial range in the plane of the sky ( below the size of a given object along the los direction ) . in the spirit of keeping the description in terms of structure functions , which might be better suited for some type of real observations . and",
    ", using the limited range we have , it is still possible to do a comparative analysis between the spectral index of structure functions of centroids to that of integrated velocity or density .    from figures [ fig : ps_all][fig :",
    "sf_all_mod ] we see that the relative importance of the density and velocity statistics on the centroids changes with the mach number of turbulence . for the low @xmath164 model ( panels [ _ a _ ] in figs .",
    "[ fig : ps_all][fig : sf_all_mod ] ) the level of the density fluctuations is very small compared to the velocity fluctuations ( weighted by @xmath108 and @xmath233 respectively ) and all the centroids trace remarkably well the velocity statistics . in this case",

    "we can also see for supersonic turbulence the slope of the structure function of unnormalized centroids is almost always steeper than that of column density .",
    "this means that one need to use the full criterion as proposed in le03 to judge whether centroids will trace velocity or not .",
    "we will see however that our simplification of the criterion seems to discriminate when centroids trace the statistics of integrated velocity , at least for the data sets employed here .",
    "for all the supersonic cases the measured power - spectrum index from the the different centroids fail to give the index of velocity . and in general , their centroids index is found to lie between those of velocity and density , with more scatter for the original simulations compared to the reformed fields .",
    "for the original data - sets of models b , c , and d the ratio @xmath237 is @xmath238 respectively . for the corresponding reformed data - cubes our simplified criterion gives @xmath239 . in all of these cases @xmath240 is not strictly true , and indeed there is an important contribution of density fluctuations .",

    "these 3d statistics were integrated numerically to get @xmath117 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 . to check the accuracy of the 3d quantities obtained and our numerical integration to",
    "2d we verified with the cases in which the statistics can be also obtained directly in 2d ( e.g. @xmath242 $ ] , @xmath243 $ ] ) , finding always a good agreement .",
    "the results of the decomposition in terms of power - spectra ( equation [ [ eq : ps_s_main ] ] , after @xmath244 average ) are shown in figure [ fig : ps_i3_4 ] for the original simulations , and in figure [ fig : ps_i3_4_mod ] for the reformed data - sets .",
    "the decomposition for @xmath80 averaged structure - functions is presented in in figures [ fig : sf_i3_4 ] , and [ fig : sf_i3_4_mod ] ; for the original , and modified data - sets respectively .",
    "something to notice is that , because structure functions span over fewer decades in the vertical axis , the separation of all the terms is generally more clear than for power - spectra .",
    "it is also to be noticed , that for the subsonic model ( a ) , the spectrum and structure function of centroids are almost unaffected by density fluctuations , cross - terms , or density velocity cross - correlations .",
    "cross - correlations are found to be larger for supersonic turbulence compared to the subsonic case , but from this limited data set we can not conclude that they scale in some particular way with the sonic mach number .",
    "it is also significant that the cross - term increases relative to the other terms with @xmath164 . for spectra , in all the supersonic models ( b , c , and d )",
    "the cross - term @xmath117 is dominant .",
    "this would mean that the log - log slope measured from spectra in all of this cases is not a direct reflection of the velocity spectral index . at the same time we observe that the magnitude of density - velocity cross - correlations can only be entirely ignored for model a ( subsonic turbulence ) . for structure functions the cross - term is comparable or larger in magnitude than the contribution of column density . at the same time it gets closer , but does not become larger than @xmath134 .",
    "in fact , it was found to be always steeper than the velocity term , therefore its contribution at the small scales could be neglected .",
    "velocity - density cross - correlations in @xmath121 for all the cases we considered here never had an important impact on the statistics of centroids .",
    "anyway , @xmath245 as a whole ( especially at the smallest separations , which we are most interested in ) has been found to be smaller than the integrated velocity term .",
    "suggesting that there could be cases where @xmath245 the cross - term and cross - correlations can be neglected .",
    "however , since the indices from power - spectra of centroids failed to give the velocity spectral index for models b , c , and d , we conclude that the retrieval of spectral indices from velocity centroids over the entire inertial range should be restricted to very low sonic mach numbers ( @xmath246 ) .",
    "furthermore , the relative importance of the cross - terms grow together with the column density term as the strength of turbulence increases . for @xmath247",
    "certainly the contribution of the column density is considerable . in this case",
    "mvcs could be used to remove the contribution from the column density term in the structure function of centroids .",
    "however at such high mach number the cross - terms can not be neglected either .    at a first glance",
    "it might seem surprising that the velocity centroids could be dominated by velocity even when the 3d structure functions of density had a zero point ( offset ) larger than that of velocity .",
    "this effect arises primarily from the fact that the density is positive defined , and necessarily has a non zero mean whereas the velocity field can have a zero mean .",
    "this results in the factors that multiply the density and velocity structure functions in equation ( [ eq : d2 ] ) .",
    "the factor @xmath248 multiplies the density structure function , and we can minimize the undesired density contribution by shifting our velocity axis in such a way that @xmath249 . for a more detailed discussion about the velocity and density zero levels",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we have seen how density fluctuations in supersonic turbulence affect our ability to determine the velocity spectral index from observations . but is there something else velocity centroids could be used for , even in supersonic turbulence ?",
    "the presence of a magnetic field introduces a preferential direction of motion , thus breaking the isotropy in the turbulent cascade . in a turbulent magnetized plasma ,",
    "eddies become elongated along the direction of the _ local _ magnetic field .",
    "velocity statistics have been suggested to study this anisotropy @xcite .",
    "for instance , iso - contours of two point statistics of velocity centroids instead of being circular , as in the isotropic case , are ellipses with symmetry axis that reveals the direction of the _ mean _ magnetic field .",
    "we present in figure [ fig : anis ] contours of equal correlation of velocity centroids ( unnormalized ) from our simulations .",
    "the magnitude of the magnetic field determines how much anisotropy will be present .",
    "we can see from figure [ fig : anis ] that the anisotropy is very clear for models a , b , and d , regardless of the large differences in sonic mach number and plasma @xmath163 .",
    "the only case in which the anisotropy is not evident ( model c ) is our only super - alfvnic simulation .",
    "the concept of super - alfvnic turbulence is advocated , for instance , by @xcite for molecular clouds .    another way to visualize",
    "the anisotropy is to plot the correlation functions of centroids in the parallel or perpendicular directions relative to @xmath250 , this is shown in figure [ fig : anis_2 ] .    in our simulations",
    "this corresponds to plot the value at the intercepts in figure [ fig : anis ] , in observations it would mean to plot the correlation function only along the major or minor axis of the contours of equal correlation .",
    "the anisotropy is evident as a different scale - length ( correlation - length ) for correlations in the parallel or perpendicular to the mean magnetic field . for subsonic turbulence",
    "the degree of anisotropy reflects the ratio @xmath251 .",
    "however for supersonic turbulence as the contributions of density get important , and as density at high mach number gets more isotropic ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one could expect the anisotropy to decrease while the ratio @xmath252 stays the same .",
    "we found very little evidence of this decrease , as can be verified from models a , b , and d in figure [ fig : anis_2 ] , all the three runs have the same @xmath252 , and a large contrast in sonic mach number . in model c even though the magnetic pressure is larger than the gas pressure ( @xmath253 ) , it corresponds to a weak mean field @xmath254 . in this case",
    "the magnetic field has very chaotic structure at large scales ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as the fluctuations at large scale determine the anisotropy of the projected data , the mhd anisotropy is erased after los averaging .    whether the ism is sub - alfvnic is still up for debate .",
    "the fact that centroids are only anisotropic for sub - alfvnic turbulence gives us an opportunity to study the conditions under which that is the case .",
    "it is certainly encouraging , that for sub - alfvnic turbulence the degree of anisotropy does not seem to be strongly affected by density fluctuations .",
    "however , we should add a word of warning in trying to determine the ratio @xmath252 from velocity centroids in supersonic turbulence .",
    "the fact that centroids do not represent velocity for @xmath255 calls for some caution as to what extent the ratio @xmath252 can be obtained from observations .",
    "nonetheless , the result on the direction of the mean field is rather robust , including for highly supersonic turbulence , provided a relatively large ordered component @xmath250 .",
    "anisotropies of turbulence measured by different techniques , including centroids , provide a promising way of measuring the direction of the perpendicular to the los component of the magnetic field . for practical purposes",
    "the technique can be tested using polarized radiation arising from aligned dust grains ( see @xcite for a discussion of grain alignment ) , or co polarization arising from goldreich - kylatis effect ( see * ? ? ? * ) .    for any particular observational data one should bear in mind that only the plane - of - sky components of mean and fluctuating magnetic field are available .",
    "therefore , for instance , a cloud with sub - alfvnic turbulence but with a mean magnetic field directed along the line of sight would look like a cloud with super - alfvnic turbulence .",
    "the distinction between the two cases may be done , however , using an ensemble of clouds .",
    "it is unlikely to have mean magnetic field always directed towards the observer .",
    "if , indeed , the turbulence is typically sub - alfvnic , the anisotropy should show up in centroid maps .",
    "we used mhd data - cubes to produce centroid maps , and explored the limitations of velocity centroids for studying interstellar turbulence .",
    "we investigated numerically the analytical predictions in our previous study of velocity centroids ( le03 ) . in that work",
    ", we decomposed the structure function of velocity centroids into three main contributions , namely integrated ( or column ) density , integrated velocity , and `` cross - terms '' . by calculating separately all the terms in the structure function of unnormalized centroids we showed that the decomposition works well .",
    "we found two important restrictions on the procedure accuracy , both related to the finite resolution in the numerical simulations .",
    "first , structure functions of integrated quantities can in principle be used to retrieve the underlying 3d spectral index if calculated for lags either much greater or much smaller than the los extent of the object .",
    "we showed however , that with the resolution used here ( @xmath32 ) structure function of integrated quantities can only give an upper limit on the actual spectral index .",
    "second , the limited inertial range in our simulations present an additional constraint on the accuracy of estimating the spectral index , mainly because the measured log - log slope is very sensitive the range of scales used .    in regards to the finite width projection effects one can potentially still do a comparative study of the centroid statistics with the statistics of velocity and density .",
    "that is , we can compare the spectral index of the centroid maps to that of column density or integrated density , and see to which one is closer .",
    "however , for real observational data with the possibility to sample lags @xmath85 , obtaining the 3d spectral index directly from structure functions is not a problem .",
    "power - spectrum is an alternative to obtain the scaling properties of the turbulent velocity field that does not suffer of such projection effects ( i.e. the spectral index can be measured at any wave - numbers within the inertial range ) . in order to use power - spectra too , we constructed a power - spectra decomposition analogous to that in le03 . and ,",
    "by calculating each term separately , we tested successfully the validity of this decomposition .",
    "we found that the scaling properties of the underlying velocity field ( i.e. spectral index ) can be reliably retrieved for subsonic turbulence .",
    "however , the contamination from cross - terms clearly showed up in all the supersonic cases for spectra , while for structure functions it was only evident for @xmath256 . to alleviate the other problem ( not enough inertial range ) we introduced reformed versions of the original simulations .",
    "the power spectra of new data - set are strict power - laws , with almost the same spatial structure , and density - velocity cross - correlations .",
    "the spectral indices obtained with these reformed data sets are in better agreement with the analytical predictions .",
    "we also tested successfully a criterion for which velocity centroids give trustworthy information ( equation [ [ eq : crit_full ] ] ) , that can be obtained entirely from observations . for practical purposes we suggest as the first approach an approximation of the criterion in le03 in terms only of the variances of the maps of column density and velocity centroids instead of computing all the structure function ( equation [ [ eq : crit_simp ] ] ) .",
    "if this ratio is less than unity velocity centroids are not trustworthy .",
    "when the ratio in eq.([eq : crit_simp ] ) is small but larger than unity it is recommendable to use the full criterion , as proposed in le03 . in our only case of subsonic turbulence ( model a ) centroids traced the integrated velocity structure function extremely well . and , our simplified criteria was fulfilled : @xmath257 , for the original , and reformed data - set respectively . for the rest of the models ( b , c , d ) the criteria was not satisfied ( @xmath258 $ ] ) , and the centroids failed to trace the statistics of the velocity field . in this models",
    "one can see a better correspondence between centroids and integrated velocity for the @xmath259 runs compared to the highly supersonic case @xmath256 .",
    "thus , one might hope centroids to be able to trace the spectral index of velocity for supersonic turbulence , but only for @xmath246 .",
    "we must recognize that this study was done using a limited data set .",
    "a more complete exploration of parameter space is desirable to determine better the range of applicability of velocity centroids , including mvcs .",
    "we have seen that velocity centroids are only reliable at low mach numbers . at the same time",
    "there are other techniques available that work for strongly supersonic turbulence , such as vca and vcs .",
    "the techniques are complementary and can be used simultaneously . for subsonic turbulence , vca and vcs",
    "can be used with higher mass species .",
    "note , that the different techniques pick up different components of velocity tensor .",
    "this can potentially allow a separation of compressional and solenoidal parts of the velocity field ( le03 ) .",
    "determining these components are crucial for understanding properties of interstellar turbulence , its sources and its dissipation .",
    "we stress that every technique has its own advantages .",
    "velocity centroids can reproduce velocity better than vca and vcs when the velocity statistics is not a straight power - law",
    ". therefore velocity centroids can better pick up dissipation and injection of energy scales .",
    "nonetheless , one have to bear in mind that spectral indices derived from all of the techniques above do not provide a complete description of turbulence .",
    "anisotropy is another parameter that can be studied .",
    "for instance , we showed that velocity centroids are useful to study the anisotropy of the turbulent cascade , even for highly supersonic turbulence .",
    "we showed however , that this is restricted to a relatively large mean field . for super - alfvnic turbulence ,",
    "a model favored by some researchers @xcite , the anisotropy of centroids is marginal , which allows to test these theories .",
    "anisotropy is not only present in velocity centroid maps , but in other statistics as well , such as _ spectral correlation function _",
    "( see * ? ? ?",
    "combining the two measure can improve the confidence in the results .    additionally , we need tools to study the turbulence variations in space ( i.e. intermittency ) .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "velocity centroids can be easily recasted in terms of higher order statistics , opening a new window for intermittency studies .",
    "is worth noting that higher moments can provide the directions of the intermittent structures if those get oriented in respect to magnetic field .",
    "our results indicate that such studies can be carried out even for high mach number turbulence .",
    "in addition , studies of intermittency with centroids can be incorporated to other techniques .",
    "for instance , the interpretation of results of the principal component analysis ( pca ) technique suggested as a tool for turbulence studies by @xcite depends on the degree of intermittency of turbulence ( @xcite ; heyer 2004 private communication ) .",
    "velocity centroids have been used for studies of turbulence for many decades .",
    "how can we comment on these studies from the point of view of our present theoretical understanding ?",
    "let us glance at the available studies .",
    "turbulence in regions is usually subsonic .",
    "therefore velocity centroids could be probably trustworthy there ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the same is probably true for studies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) term , which can be tested . ] where turbulence is highly supersonic in cold .",
    "we feel that a more careful analysis of particular conditions present in the regions under study is necessary , however .",
    "one one hand , while the turbulence is supersonic for molecular clouds , the cores of molecular clouds are mostly subsonic ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". for such cores velocity centroids provide a reliable tool for obtaining velocity statistics , if the resolution of the cores is adequate . on the other hand ,",
    "our results are based on the analysis of isothermal numerical simulations . in the presence of",
    "substantial density contrasts caused by the co - existence of different phases the velocity centroids may get unreliable even for subsonic turbulence .",
    "therefore testing of the necessary criteria discussed in this paper may be advantageous not only with the molecular and data , but also with data obtained for regions .",
    "we also note , that for the present analysis we assumed that the emission is optically thin and the emissivity is proportional to the first power of density .",
    "discussion of more complex , but still observationally valuable cases will be done elsewhere .",
    "the work started in this direction ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is encouraging .",
    "recent work on centroids includes papers by @xcite where they noticed that centroids poorly reproduce velocity statistics for supersonic turbulence .",
    "our work above confirms their finding and also establishes a regime ( @xmath260 ) when the results by centroids can be reliable .",
    "a quite different and optimistic conclusion about centroids was obtained in @xcite .",
    "they used brownian noise artificial data and obtained an excellent correspondence between the centroids and the underlying velocity .",
    "from the point of view of our analysis the origin of this correspondence is in the choice of the mean density level . in these",
    "simulation in order to make the density positively defined the authors were adding a substantial mean density to the fluctuating density .",
    "it is clear from eq.([eq : i2 ] ) that adding mean density increases of the contribution of @xmath134 term that is the term responsible for the velocity contribution .",
    "this work is complementary to the work on delta variance of centroids that we do in collaboration with ossenkopf and stutzki @xcite .",
    "there brownian noise simulations are used , but extra care is taken to avoid being misled by the effect of adding mean density .",
    "an iterative procedure is proposed there , which allows to correct for the contribution of the cross - terms when density - velocity correlations are negligible .    in this paper",
    "we are dealing mostly with unnormalized centroids .",
    "the modified centroids ( mvcs ) allow a different outlook at the problem of obtaining velocity statistics from the small scale asymptotics . indeed",
    ", our analysis in the paper shows that the term @xmath121 is unimportant for the cases that we studied .",
    "in addition ,",
    "we believe that velocity has steep spectra . therefore , if the density is also steep , asymptotically the term @xmath119 , which is then steeper than both velocity and density , should be negligible ( see appendix e.1 ) . as the result , _ if we see from the integrated intensity maps that density indeed is steep , we can use mvcs as suggested in le03 _ , that for sufficiently small lags are bound to represent the velocity statistics . the critical scale at which this is true can be obtained using the analytical expressions found in appendix b.1 . formally to find such critical scale one should know the mean density . however ,",
    "if the inertial range is sufficiently long , one should not be worried about the exact value for that critical scale .",
    "we have not seen much advantages of such a use in our numerical runs because of the limited inertial range available . however , unlike numerical simulations , astrophysical conditions provide us with a substantially larger inertial range .",
    "for instance , @xcite showed that the turbulent spectrum for velocity spans from the size of the smc , which is @xmath261 kpc , to the minimal scale resolved , i.e. @xmath262 pc .",
    "in partially ionized gas we expect this spectrum to proceed to sub - parsec scales . in fully ionized gas",
    "( see also discussion in @xcite ) the scale of alfvn and slow mode damping may be hundreds of kilometers only",
    ".    the limitations of this asymptotic approach stem from the fact that for supersonic turbulence the density field tends to become shallower .",
    "but , as we can see from the mhd simulations used here , at @xmath259 we find that it is still steep and therefore the mvcs should be reliable asymptotically .",
    "therefore , for handling observational data we can provide another prescription : `` if the inertial range is sufficiently long and density is steep then mvcs asymptotically represent the velocity field . ''",
    "for instance , steep density was reported in @xcite .",
    "thus for such density fields asymptotic use of mvcs should be advantageous .    in the cases",
    "when the underlying statistics is not a power law the interpretation of centroids is more involved .",
    "this we have seen with our analysis of non - power - law data from mhd simulations .",
    "while centroids do represent injection and damping scales , the integration along the line of sight does interfere with a more fine detail study . in this situations",
    "one should use the full technique of inversion as proposed in @xcite .",
    "however , we expect that in most cases astrophysical turbulence is self - similar over large expanses of scales and therefore the power - law representation is adequate .",
    "we have made use of the analytical expressions for unnormalized velocity centroids ( le03 ) .",
    "our work as well as a study in @xcite , show that normalization of centroids improve them rather marginally , while it makes the analytical insight essentially impossible . in this paper we tested that major conclusions reached for unnormalized centroids are applicable to the normalized ones .",
    "in this paper we have provided a systematic study of velocity centroids as a technique of retrieving velocity statistics from observations .",

    "this result is valid for both steep and shallow density fields with steep velocity .",
    "we showed that velocity - density cross - correlations are marginally important for our data set , at least for small lags .",
    "combined with the fact that products of density and velocity structure functions get subdominant for steep velocity and density at small lags , this provides a way to reliably study turbulence using mvcs .",
