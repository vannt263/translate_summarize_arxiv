    "<S> by an explicite calculation of michelson interferometric output intensities in the optomechanical scheme proposed by marshall _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , an oscillatory factor is obtained that may go down to zero just at the time a visibility revival ought to be observed . including a properly tuned phase shifter offers a simple amendment to the situation . by using a pockels phase shifter with fast time - dependent modulation in one arm </S>",
    "<S> , one may obtain further possibilities to enrich the quantum state preparation and reconstruction abilities of the original scheme , thereby improving the chances to reliably detect genuine quantum behaviour of a nanomechanical oscillator .    </S>",
    "<S> detecting genuine quantum effects in nanomechanical systems is a highly desirable scope , expected to be reached in the near future . </S>",
    "<S> the major challenges are : efficient cooling close to the ground state , sufficiently strong coupling to a well - identified quantum system , reliable preparation and identification of non - classical states of the nanomechanical component . </S>",
    "<S> most of the experimental studies are done on mechanical oscillators , considered harmonic for the small displacements characteristic for the quantum domain . for those systems ground - state cooling means </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 which is relatively easy to fulfil for hard ( high - frequency ) oscillators @xcite . for them , however , preparing and analyzing quantum states is overly demanding @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the efforts to reconcile these conflicting requirements have seen rapid and most competitive advance with the participation of a number of experimental groups . a still more ambitious </S>",
    "<S> , so far elusive prospect of related studies would be to detect deviations from standard quantum mechanics , predicted by several theoretical studies @xcite .    an original and promising project , using a soft ( low - frequency ) </S>",
    "<S> nanomechanical oscillator , coupled by a mirror to one of the paths of a michelson interferometer , and using fabry - perot cavities ( on both paths , to preserve interference ) to strengthen the optomechanical coupling , has been started by marshall _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and following extensive development of an optical feedback cooling technique @xcite , is now approaching the level of seeing quantum effects .    according to the argument of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , for a single - photon source of frequency @xmath1 , and a vibrating mirror of effective mass @xmath2 and vibration frequency @xmath3 , acting as one of the mirrors delimiting a fabry - perot resonator cavity of length @xmath4 , the dimensionless coupling constant is @xmath5 . with the vibrating - mirror cavity on interferometer arm @xmath6 , and the cavity with two rigid mirrors on arm @xmath7 , starting with a mirror in its quantum mechanical ground state @xmath8 , coupling during time @xmath9 results in an entangled photon - mirror state @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote one - photon states with the photon in arm @xmath6 and in arm @xmath7 resp . , whereas , @xmath13 and @xmath8 are two coherent states of respective complex amplitudes @xmath14 and @xmath15 of the vibrating mirror , appearing as a pair of schrdinger cat states entangled to the respective orthogonal photon states @xmath16 and @xmath17 . finally , @xmath18    the density matrix @xmath19 corresponding to the pure state @xmath20 can be expanded on the photon state basis @xmath21 , @xmath22 in the form of a two - by - two matrix @xmath23 where the matrix elements are operators acting on variables of the vibrating mirror . </S>",
    "<S> it has been pointed out @xcite that the crucial quantity characterizing the interference pattern to be observed is the nondiagonal element on that basis , @xmath24 , which carries extra information about the motion of the vibrating mirror , missing from the more usual reduced density matrix @xmath25 , obtained by tracing out @xmath26 over photon variables .    </S>",
    "<S> interference visibility , as expressed by @xmath27 , carries a signature of the motion of the vibrating mirror , but the usefulness of that signature is seriously limited by interactions of the mirror with the environment . neglecting direct environmental effects on the photon subsystem , the above expansion remains valid , allowing decoherence and friction of the vibrating mirror to be included in the dynamics of @xmath27 and analyzed by standard tools @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> returning for a moment to the decoherence - free case covered by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mirrors ] ) , let us quote the result of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : @xmath28                      = \\frac12 e^{i\\varphi(t ) - |\\alpha(t)|^2/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath29 means trace over mirror variables . from here </S>",
    "<S> one concludes that the crucial quantity to keep under control is @xmath30 , and - using eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ phases ] ) - the observation should be carried out at multiples of time @xmath31 , where @xmath30 returns to @xmath15 and the interference signal can be large enough to be observed , under the extremely stringent condition that decoherence could be suppressed by sufficient cooling and isolation from mechanical supports .    that treatment catches the essential point of the phenomenon but fails to give a correct description of the underlying oscillatory behaviour , which is relevant for a reliable identification of superposition states of the mirror . </S>",
    "<S> to show that , we proceed by noticing that eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mirrors ] ) is not the final state observed by the photon detectors , since the photons pass once more through the beam splitter , before reaching output ports @xmath32 ( facing @xmath6 ) and @xmath33 ( facing @xmath7 ) . on the time scale of whatever happens to the vibrating mirror , </S>",
    "<S> this is a fast and coherence - preserving unitary operation on the photon subsystem , transforming the intermediate state ( [ mirrors ] ) into the final one @xmath34\\ ] ] with @xmath35 and @xmath36 . carrying out the above unitary transformation on the full density matrix , now we can trace over mirror ( and eventually , for a full analysis , environmental ) variables to obtain directly the density matrix of the photons to be detected , in the form @xmath37 with the diagonal elements @xmath38 describing the output intensities on the two respective ports , and the off - diagonal elements @xmath39^ * = \\frac12 { \\rm re } \\left(\\tr_m\\hat\\rho_{ab}\\right ) + i \\left(\\frac12 - \\tr_m \\hat\\rho_{aa}\\right)\\ ] ] describing cross - correlations between the two detectors .    of particular interest are the output intensities , and we see from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ diag ] ) that , instead of the modulus of @xmath40 , they display the _ imaginary _ part of the same quantity . evaluating , like before , the decoherence - free case </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain @xmath41\\right)\\\\                   & = & \\frac12 \\left(1\\,\\mp\\,e^{-\\kappa^2(1-\\cos \\omega_m t)}\\ ,                        \\sin \\left [ \\kappa^2(\\omega_m t - \\sin \\omega_m t)+\\chi(t)\\right]\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used equation ( [ phases ] ) , and for the discussion to follow , included an additional phase shift @xmath42 created by a phase shifter device on arm @xmath6 of the michelson interferometer , not present in the original setup @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> having to measure the imaginary part of @xmath40 makes a huge difference . without the phase shifter , </S>",
    "<S> that factor oscillates as @xmath43 , which - depending on the actual value of the optomechanical coupling constant @xmath44 - may go down close to zero just about time @xmath45 , when the @xmath46th visibility revival is expected . </S>",
    "<S> there is a simple amendment though : one should include a constant phase shifter and tune it to @xmath47 to match the @xmath46th maximum of the oscillatory factor with the expected revival time . with that </S>",
    "<S> , revivals become observable in the interferometric intensity patterns , as soon as decoherence effects are suppressed to the desired level @xcite ; of course , to see at least @xmath48 would be the minimum requirement . alternatively , if noise level of data allows , scanning with @xmath49 to locate the maximum signal can be a way to measure the coupling constant @xmath44 .    </S>",
    "<S> the above reasoning connects the marshall _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ scheme to a simple token introduced by yurke and stoler @xcite , used in various experiments @xcite to overcome some of the difficulties associated with the entanglement present e.g. in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mirrors ] ) , and create a visible interference pattern of the two schrdinger cat components , as apparent in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mirrorcat ] ) , observable through straightforward intensity measurement of a chosen component of the associated two - state quantum system . in the marshall _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ scheme it is the last passage through the michelson beamsplitter that - acting as a @xmath50 quasi - spin rotation of the two - state photon basis - offers a kind of gratis implementation of the yurke and stoler procedure ; this was the original motivation for the present work .    alas , just seing the visibility revival would not prove quantumness @xcite . therefore to reach that final scope </S>",
    "<S> it may be necessary to add a time - dependent phase shifter @xmath42 to the photon subsystem . that can strongly enhance the possibilities of preparing and analysing quantum states of an oscillator , as demonstrated by the successful application of phase controlling protocols in ion - trap schrdinger cat experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> optical phase shifters based on the pockels effect are commercially available , and admit electric modulation at frequencies up to a few ghz @xcite , with the potentiality to make the marshall _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ nanomechanical schrdinger cat mew more clearly about his / her quantum behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> some of the possibilities offered by that token will be analyzed in a forthcoming paper .    </S>",
    "<S> support by the hungarian scientific research fund otka under grant no . </S>",
